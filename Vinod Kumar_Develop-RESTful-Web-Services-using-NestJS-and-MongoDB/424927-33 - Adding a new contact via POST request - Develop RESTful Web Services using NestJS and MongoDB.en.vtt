00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.500
In the previous lecture,

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.700
we created this contact schema,

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:08.170
and now we can use this contact schema and create a model definition.

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:14.150
Register that with bongos so mangos can do the dependency injection toe our services.

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.200
So the first step is to go to the Contact start model Doctor.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.650
Yes,

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.700
and then including imports section,

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:27.000
wherein we can give a bunch off other models our model configurations.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.420
In this case,

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:33.800
we're gonna use a model called Mongoose Model dot far feature on,

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.300
then register a bunch off model definitions.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.480
As you can see,

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.400
it's an Audi on each model definition.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.300
Correspond toe.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.750
A collection in or mongo DB database as well as this key mother were created.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:53.990
Since we have a collection called Contacts were going to give a name off the model called

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:55.450
Contact in Singular.

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.940
This will be automatically pluralist for the name of the collection,

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.350
which means if they're given here contact.

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.330
It will be mad to a collection called Contacts.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.870
And if you're given a name here called person automatically,

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.830
mongers will look for a collection called people,

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.020
and if the collections don't exist,

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.440
it'll automatically be created.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.660
Also the second perimeter to the model definition is the scheme.

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:20.340
I excels,

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:28.330
which is nothing but contact Schema on our model definition is really we know can goto our

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:33.660
contact service and then ask for the dependency injection off this model and at a

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.110
constructor and in the constructor,

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.940
we're going to declare a private variable on the variable represents a class which is

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:42.990
nothing but our contact model.

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.560
So I'm gonna take your contact model off type model.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.450
And this model comes from mangoes.

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:50.580
It is generic.

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.790
So I have to specify what did the structure off a document here.

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:58.420
And the structure of the document is there in our contact schemer.

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.670
And it's nothing but the class called contact.

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.150
So I'm gonna go here and then type contact.

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.040
Make sure that import from contact that schema Onda.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.320
Then,

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.720
of course,

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:13.880
I have to give the open and close bracket model needs to be imported from Mang goes so well

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.880
,

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:19.750
they hear from mangoes and then go on And are the model over here.

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.370
If you carefully observed in the context model,

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:24.420
when we register,

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.970
we have registered and a day off model definitions.

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.860
When we are asking for a model here,

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.590
it is possible that there may be multiple model definitions on the one we want.

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:41.100
Nestor toe inject here is the one that has this name called Contact Ondo.

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.430
Specify that we use a decorator called at Inject Model,

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.690
and this comes from next year's Mang Goes on.

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.460
I'll have to do is to pass the name of the model,

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.360
which is nothing but a contact.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:59.160
And with this now our dependency injection is really we can now use this particular class

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.250
and then perform the current operations.

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.360
So let's begin by creating a function for adding a new contact.

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:13.640
Let's call this as our one contact which receives a contact object as a perimeter off type

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.340
contact inside dysfunction.

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.710
Let's create an object off contact model.

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:19.560
So I'm gonna say here,

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.880
let C equals toe new distort,

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:28.780
contact modern And then I can supply the contact as the perimeter to the constructor Or I

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.840
can create a new object.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:36.740
Spread the value off this and the spread operator is usedto avoid the mutation.

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:38.140
So this particular perimeter,

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:39.980
now that we have the c,

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:40.890
I can simply say,

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.100
si dot save,

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:45.970
which actually saves the data in this particular variable,

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.940
which is nothing but a copy off this contact comes back with a new I D.

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:51.870
Which is the underscore.

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.170
Any property we know can simply return this scene on.

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:59.860
We're done with this particular function to make it off this function.

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.270
Let's go to our contacts,

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:06.230
controller and write a function that acts as a post request handler.

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.910
So that's call this function as create contact,

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:12.750
which receives a body from the request.

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:18.520
But we want this to be off type contact and contact needs to be imported from contact dot

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:19.650
scheme or 30 years.

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.190
And to insert this data into our mongo DB collection,

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:24.460
we first need toe.

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.520
Get this contact services a dependency.

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.020
Let's go and add a constructor over here and in the constructor perimeter.

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.770
We're gonna receive a service off type contact service.

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:35.580
Of course,

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.930
if you want to make it off this service in other functions were to mark This s private,

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.450
our public protected.

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:43.340
And now that we have this service,

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:44.330
we can say this.

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:51.530
Start service dot Add one contact and let's apply the body in orderto map dysfunction to

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:56.950
the http post we have toe add the decorator called a direct post.

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:01.950
There is no need to give any perimeter to this because we want to handle the request for

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:03.210
slash context.

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:09.500
However we want toe are the two more decorators here number one decorator To say that this

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:14.800
variable should receive the content of the request body and that's done by typing at the

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:15.570
right body.

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:21.830
The 2nd 1 is to say that the body should be validated against this particular data type.

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:22.920
And Father,

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:25.220
I can simply come here and then say at the right,

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:29.800
use pipes on the pipe that I want to use is nothing but validation.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:30.130
Fight.

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:34.970
If you want the validation pipe to automatically transfer the payload into the contact

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:35.470
object,

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:42.720
we can also say new elevation pipe and then supply contract object that says transform is

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:43.950
nothing but true.

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:45.310
So with this now,

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:48.050
our request handler is also ready.

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:53.760
Let's first go check word of the content available in our mongo DB Davis collection and you

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.450
can see that we have these two.

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:59.630
So let's go to the postman on at a new contact First,

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:05.890
I'm gonna select post from this drop down the you release http Colon double slash local

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:13.060
host Colin 3000 slash contacts and then the body is nothing but raw.

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:14.050
Jason,

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:16.750
if I don't supply any values,

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:21.070
I should get an editor because we have used the validation pipe.

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:22.230
Let's click on,

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:22.720
Send in,

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:27.410
check the same thing and you can see regard an error 400 as expected,

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:29.330
on a bunch off error messages.

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:30.190
So that's going,

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:31.330
Are they object?

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:32.160
Over here?

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:36.020
Let's supply and name and I'm gonna supply my name.

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:38.770
We know command and then the email,

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:39.460
which is nothing.

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:42.150
But we know at the rate we know dot Co.

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:44.560
That's also at a phone number.

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:48.550
Notice that phone number should be supplied with the country court.

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:50.240
If I don't supply the country court,

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:51.660
then there'll be an editor.

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:52.730
Let's give it a try.

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:55.660
I'm gonna supply the phone number without the country core.

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:59.760
And let's also supply a couple of other fuels.

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:01.600
Although they're not really required.

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:05.530
I'm gonna take your city Bangalore on Let's say,

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:06.210
for example,

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:09.600
country India If I send this now,

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.100
although not send the state,

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:12.560
it's really another requirement.

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.050
When I click on send,

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:18.610
it should now come back with another message because the phone number is not valid

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:19.940
according to the requirements,

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:25.280
so Let's click on Send and see the same thing and it comes back with the method saying

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:27.310
phone must be a valued phone number.

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:29.570
So let's go Another country court here.

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:31.910
How to say plus nine one on,

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:34.740
Probably a space click on send on.

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:36.980
This time we didn't get any error message.

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:37.400
Plus,

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:39.970
the status is 201 created.

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:43.550
This comes because there is no response body.

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:44.460
However,

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:49.400
if I go back to the mongo db shell and then very fight that documents over here,

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:51.650
let me clear the screen and then issue the command.

00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:52.300
Once again,

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:57.210
you can see that the new document has been inserted with an idee.

00:07:57.210 --> 00:07:57.730
Now,

00:07:57.730 --> 00:07:59.880
if you wanted this to be the response,

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:05.870
you can go back to the V A school on return the same like this that's going check it out

00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:06.430
once again,

00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:09.900
I'm gonna go back Toe Postman are another record.

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:11.410
Maybe the same content.

00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:12.760
Let's click on send.

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:15.160
So we got a response.

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:19.340
After adding the data into the Mongo DB collection to verify the same,

00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:23.330
let's go back to the mongo db Shell issue the command Once again,

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:26.680
you can see that the new document has been inserted successfully.

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:30.920
I really we don't want emails and phone numbers to be duplicated,

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:31.950
but I self no,

00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:37.570
we already have added the duplicate email and phone number so toe alive these first,

00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:41.580
let's drop the collection on recreate by adding a new one.

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:45.630
But this time we want to ensure that phone number and email are unique.

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:47.160
So to drop the collection,

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:48.050
I'm going to say,

00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:52.530
db dot context dot drop and thats going toe.

00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:53.680
Drop the collection.

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:56.310
You can check it out by typing show collections,

00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:58.960
and you will see that there is no collection anymore.

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:03.680
So to indicate that our email and phone number are supposed to be unique,

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:09.370
let's go back to our contact schema and then wherever we have added the ad rate prop over

00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:11.260
here for email and phone number,

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.860
we now have to say here in curly bracket,

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:16.770
which is not the murder configuration object will stay here.

00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:22.550
Unique is nothing but true and the same thing I'm gonna copy and paste for the phone number

00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:22.550
,

00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:26.050
and now mongers will take it off,

00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:28.980
ensuring that this is a unique value.

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:32.410
So let's go back to over Postman Onda.

00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:35.610
Try sending this once so the first time.

00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:36.950
It should be added.

00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:41.430
If I go back to the shell and then check the show collections,

00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:47.800
you can see that we had given the name of your model as contact so it would have cleared a

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:49.240
collection called Context.

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:50.350
And if a type here,

00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:51.860
David or contracts start,

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:53.570
find or find one.

00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:56.270
Let's have find dot pretty press enter.

00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:57.550
We got this.

00:09:57.550 --> 00:10:01.770
If I go back to the postman and then try to send the same data again,

00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:05.320
you will see that it is coming back over here.

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:05.930
However,

00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:09.430
you can see that it is not under this second record.

00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:12.680
It's the same document gets updated once more.

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:13.860
However,

00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:15.590
if I go back to the Postman,

00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:17.800
probably changed the email.

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:18.080
Let's say,

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:18.640
for example,

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:19.180
in Slough.

00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:24.490
We know that you know dot co and say that this is We know that example dot com and then

00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:26.870
probably change the phone number from this to,

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:27.200
let's say,

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:27.950
for example,

00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:30.150
Double zero click on Send.

00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:32.550
This time it should be a new document,

00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:33.930
unlike the previous one.

00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:37.530
So let's go back to the Mongo DB Shell and then try the same thing.

00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:42.940
I'm gonna clear the screen and then enter the same command will see that there are two

00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:43.590
documents,

00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:44.300
not one.

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:47.480
So this is how you can use among goes toe.

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:50.690
Add a new document to your existing collection on.

00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:52.140
If the collection doesn't exist,

00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:56.870
it gets automatically created in the next lecture letter than its TDP.

00:10:56.870 --> 00:11:02.090
Get request handler to get the list off all the contacts in our mongo DB collection.
