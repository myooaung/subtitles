Hi.

2
00:00:00.437 --> 00:00:05.788
I'm Andrew Morgan, and welcome to the course, Spring Data Overview.

3
00:00:05.788 --> 00:00:06.423
In this module,

4
00:00:06.423 --> 00:00:11.719
we'll be learning about how we can use Spring to manage database transactions.

5
00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:16.244
To start with, we'll just get a quick introduction to what a transaction is.

6
00:00:16.244 --> 00:00:17.795
It's assumed we already know this,

7
00:00:17.795 --> 00:00:20.721
but we'll still have a few slides in order to set the context.

8
00:00:20.721 --> 00:00:24.221
We'll then do some analysis of some of the problems we might run

9
00:00:24.221 --> 00:00:27.309
into when coding our own transaction management.

10
00:00:27.309 --> 00:00:27.785
And finally,

11
00:00:27.785 --> 00:00:35.000
we'll learn how we can use Spring Data or actually call Spring to manage our transactions for us declaratively.
