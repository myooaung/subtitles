00:00:01.112 --> 00:00:05.384
Okay, before we get started, we're going to set up a demo project.

2
00:00:05.384 --> 00:00:06.099
Once we've done that,

3
00:00:06.099 --> 00:00:08.973
we'll have a Spring Data project ready to go for the next modules

4
00:00:08.973 --> 00:00:12.684
where we can start using the framework to query data.

5
00:00:12.684 --> 00:00:15.216
The project we'll be working on is a flight arrival system.

6
00:00:15.216 --> 00:00:16.512
For this course,

7
00:00:16.512 --> 00:00:19.365
we'll have one simple database table that stores a list

8
00:00:19.365 --> 00:00:21.161
of flights and their arrival time.

9
00:00:21.161 --> 00:00:23.716
We'll then be querying this data using Spring Data.

10
00:00:23.716 --> 00:00:27.023
It's also going to be a Spring Boot project.

11
00:00:27.023 --> 00:00:29.396
The reason for this is that it takes a convention over

12
00:00:29.396 --> 00:00:31.450
configuration approach to Spring applications,

13
00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:34.505
meaning that we'll have the minimal amount of setup

14
00:00:34.505 --> 00:00:36.456
required to get our project running.

15
00:00:36.456 --> 00:00:37.463
To put it simply,

16
00:00:37.463 --> 00:00:40.293
Spring Boot makes it easy to get your application off and running

17
00:00:40.293 --> 00:00:44.077
as quickly as possible and nowadays should be the default choice

18
00:00:44.077 --> 00:00:46.040
when creating a Spring application.

19
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.921
We'll be using Spring Data JPA during our POC as we need to

20
00:00:49.921 --> 00:00:52.555
pick at least one module in order to use it.

21
00:00:52.555 --> 00:00:55.053
But it's important to realize that we'll only be working

22
00:00:55.053 --> 00:00:58.388
with the interfaces in Spring Data Commons.

23
00:00:58.388 --> 00:01:01.108
Finally, we'll be using a H2 database.

24
00:01:01.108 --> 00:01:07.003
H2 is a fast in-memory SQL database that can be embedded into your application.

25
00:01:07.003 --> 00:01:09.502
It's mainly used for testing purposes as it doesn't

26
00:01:09.502 --> 00:01:12.354
require you to set up an external database.

27
00:01:12.354 --> 00:01:12.997
In fact,

28
00:01:12.997 --> 00:01:16.544
there's no setup or configuration to be done at all as it

29
00:01:16.544 --> 00:01:20.562
automatically starts and stops when you run a test.

30
00:01:20.562 --> 00:01:23.351
All the source code for the demo can be found on GitHub.

31
00:01:23.351 --> 00:01:25.319
You can clone it from this repository,

32
00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:28.020
or you can check the Pluralsight assets directory,

33
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:34.000
and the code will be contained there too. This will be the same for all modules.
