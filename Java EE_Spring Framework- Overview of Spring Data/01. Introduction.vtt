Hi.

2
00:00:00.454 --> 00:00:05.650
I'm Andrew Morgan, and welcome to the course, Spring Data Overview.

3
00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:06.364
In this module,

4
00:00:06.364 --> 00:00:09.068
we'll be learning about how we can use Spring Data

5
00:00:09.068 --> 00:00:13.194
repositories in order to query our data stores.

6
00:00:13.194 --> 00:00:16.552
We'll first give an overview of what the repository pattern is to call a

7
00:00:16.552 --> 00:00:20.050
pattern or abstraction that Spring Data makes use of.

8
00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.380
We'll then take a deep dive into Spring Data repositories.

9
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.651
We'll make use of the CRUD repository for CRUD operations,

10
00:00:26.651 --> 00:00:31.154
query generation with derived queries, the paging and sorting abstractions,

11
00:00:31.154 --> 00:00:33.360
and completely custom repositories.

12
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.047
We'll also take a look at how we can swap Spring Data modules entirely,

13
00:00:37.047 --> 00:00:42.000
keeping most of our code as is in order to demonstrate the shared programming model.
