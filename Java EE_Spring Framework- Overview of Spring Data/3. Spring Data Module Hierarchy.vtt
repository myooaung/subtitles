Spring Data is a collection of many projects,

2
00:00:03.191 --> 00:00:06.275
and it can be a bit confusing to understand what is what

3
00:00:06.275 --> 00:00:08.802
and how they all relate to each other.

4
00:00:08.802 --> 00:00:12.445
That's why we'll take a look now at how these projects are structured.

5
00:00:12.445 --> 00:00:14.794
The parent project is Spring Data Commons,

6
00:00:14.794 --> 00:00:17.910
which all the other modules depend on and make use of.

7
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.199
Spring Data Commons provides the interfaces or common

8
00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:24.146
programming model that everything else implements.

9
00:00:24.146 --> 00:00:27.719
For example, abstractions around CRUD, pagination and sorting,

10
00:00:27.719 --> 00:00:31.832
derived queries all come from interfaces in this project.

11
00:00:31.832 --> 00:00:34.903
This project is what our focus will be on during this course.

12
00:00:34.903 --> 00:00:39.377
Making use of Spring Data Commons, we first have our main modules.

13
00:00:39.377 --> 00:00:42.397
In the examples here, we have JPA, JDBC,

14
00:00:42.397 --> 00:00:45.574
MongoDB, Cassandra, but there are many more.

15
00:00:45.574 --> 00:00:48.065
These main modules are officially backed by Pivotal,

16
00:00:48.065 --> 00:00:50.396
the commercial enterprise that owns Spring.

17
00:00:50.396 --> 00:00:52.826
This means they're expected to be stable,

18
00:00:52.826 --> 00:00:55.331
following the same development and release lifecycle as

19
00:00:55.331 --> 00:00:57.634
the rest of the Spring framework.

20
00:00:57.634 --> 00:00:59.539
There are also community modules,

21
00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:02.551
which also depend on and implement Spring Data Commons.

22
00:01:02.551 --> 00:01:05.416
Whilst they aren't officially managed by Pivotal,

23
00:01:05.416 --> 00:01:08.354
you can expect the same familiar programming model as the other

24
00:01:08.354 --> 00:01:14.000
projects as the majority of code that you'll be working with will be coming from Spring Data Commons.
