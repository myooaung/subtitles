00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.120
welcome back now that our application is ready and we want to deploy this on toe Internet

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.280
so everybody can access in the world.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:20.760
So first thing we have to do is to convert our rear Jace application with all these source

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:28.950
code that were got in the JSX format into a simple HTML CSS JavaScript files for this first

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:31.740
let's have looking toe the Packaged or Jason,

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.750
which contains a couple of scripts over here.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:41.720
Onda we have been using this one so far by typing npm start and that's what we have

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.090
actually done over here.

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:51.320
So the NPM start has actually run a development website were on it also has given Hear him

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.480
saying that to create a production will use the NPM run bill.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.890
So start is like a keyword.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.110
So NPM start has done its job similarly test Also,

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:03.750
I can simply type npm test,

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.980
but apart from starting test any other additional entries over here If you only know them,

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.080
you have to type npm a run on then that entry name.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.910
So in this case,

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:18.220
the NPM Iran build npm Ron eject If you type your own here,

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:18.550
Daniel,

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.280
type npm Iran and What are the key you have given now?

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.090
This is what we wanted.

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.260
Oh,

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.110
so you want to say NPM build?

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.070
And that,

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.450
in turn,

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.650
is going to run a command called React Script Space Bill.

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:30.180
Now,

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.180
Yet scripts is a command that is available under nor modules.

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:39.620
If you see that there there dot bin folder on inside that you should see all the executable

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:40.360
over here.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.250
So on windows mnc dot cmd files,

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:44.060
for example,

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.010
you can see that there is one final year called React scripts on Windows.

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:53.380
You may see react scripts dot cmd and that's what actually it is running.

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.120
What we want to do now is to go back to the command prompt on then press control.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.400
See,

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.150
here to stop the star were being executed.

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:03.600
So obviously now,

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.650
if I go back to the browser and refresh,

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:10.580
you'll see that it's not gonna come back because we stopped the Sarwar no longer running.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.690
So I go back to the command prompt and then looking toe the directories that we have.

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.230
So if I say you're ls minus l,

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.080
you'll see that I don't have a folder called Build,

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.890
but I'm gonna type your NPM run bill.

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.210
This is going to create a new folder called Build,

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:31.150
which is the production build container.

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.950
What it has done in the death created a bunch of Jolliffe good fights over here.

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.490
Let's go and have a look at what is there in the build.

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:42.200
So if I go back to the rear score on,

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.470
let's collapse all these.

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.310
Let's close all the open fights.

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.710
You see that there is a new folder called Building Let's Refresh.

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.590
Once on inside the bill,

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.780
you'll see the content coming from the public folder.

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.760
We had all these folders over here like majors on bunch of files.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.690
All of them have been copied over here.

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:00.990
And in addition,

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:03.270
if you look at the index dot html right now,

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:06.980
it is kind off un formatted because it's all one liner.

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.070
Unnecessary new line characters have been eliminated,

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:14.500
and if it carefully observed the end off this particular HTML fine,

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.180
you'll see that it the first toe main dart.

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:23.800
Some hashtag chang dot Js and there is another chunk Justice Court split,

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.290
so our application is split into multiple pieces on.

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.250
Then there is some court injection that's going on over here.

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.650
Now our obligation is ready for deployment,

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.660
which is what we're gonna do in the next lecture
