00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.850
welcome back In the previous lecture,

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:10.650
we initialize the fire based project.

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.890
And if you look at carefully the folder content so I'm gonna type your ls minus l.

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:16.450
A.

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:19.850
And that's gonna show me all the files in the list format.

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:25.790
You can see that it has created a file called dot firebase artsy as the last five.

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:26.750
Based on Jason,

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.500
let's go to be a school and have a look at the same thing.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.610
You can see that the leader dots firebase RC.

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.760
It symbolises the project that we're working on is the the largest movie brother.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:43.780
So there's the project in our five best account that we created earlier on.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.270
Get if you want you work with multiple projects,

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:48.030
you can choose different ones as well.

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.570
The important failure is the firebase Don't Jason.

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.200
Dis contains information about your files,

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.800
which are going to be published,

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:02.280
and you can see that it says your bill is the public for leather It's gonna look for So the

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.060
content off this bill folder will be copied.

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.500
Toe are remotes are on Google fired.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:09.760
Better count on.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.950
It's gonna ignore a couple of files over here,

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.780
so let's go back to the command prompt and see how the deployment takes place.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.390
I'm gonna clear the screen on that.

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.570
I'm gonna take your fire based deploy on.

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.520
But this is going to now look into the five star Jason and copies all the files that are

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.540
required in tow the remote start our and it.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.060
Then it's going to give you feedback,

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.670
whether it was successful or failed.

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:31.820
And if it's successful,

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.810
what's the Ural where you can access your application from?

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:41.520
So let's press enter and it has begun the deploying it is 18 file have been found,

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.900
and that's what it's trying toe upload on finalizing the wash in and it gives me a project

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:48.720
console also.

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:49.010
Sorry.

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.210
This is where I can go on access my project.

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:53.610
But for that I have to log in,

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.810
ask the respective user.

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.090
But as this is the Ural,

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.980
that people in the world can access where the application is available.

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:08.350
So I'm gonna copy this and then go to a browser open a new incognito windows.

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.970
So I know that I have not loved being anyways,

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.480
so I'm gonna face the Ural Press entered on.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.030
You'll see that your application now is readily available on the Internet.

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.560
So let's do a search for a movie,

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.140
which might be a problem.

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.720
And there is a solution to that.

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:26.020
Also,

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.410
quickly,

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:27.290
we'll fix that.

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.050
So I'm gonna type in a movie title called Tar and Press Enter.

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.090
You can see that it changed the address over here,

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.890
but I didn't see any content over here.

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:38.350
Now,

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.010
if I press after all,

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.190
if I goto view developer JavaScript concern,

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:49.590
you will see that there is an editor on the editor is very specifically says,

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:58.920
mixed the content on the page at http s colon double slash on my application Part waas

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.580
loaded over its two DPS.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.160
So that's what it says we are loading.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.740
You're producing a secure socket layer,

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:08.150
but there is a request for an insecure XML,

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.490
actually,

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.870
particles.

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:14.850
That means sending an object request to an end point which contain http colon Now,

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:19.320
that's because the oil mdb ap a that we're using is not secure.

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.740
This is not in my control because they're not my website.

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:23.010
Right?

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.740
So the MGB a paid our comments in secular,

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:31.140
but I still want to access the same thing to fix this problem now We have to go back to our

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:36.450
index dot html The index our next email from the public folder,

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.120
which is right over here.

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:43.730
So we basically have the other meta tag over here that basically upgrades the insecure

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:45.700
content toe a secure one.

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:52.450
What we do is we are your meta on with the extra DP equals equals toe content,

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.200
security dash policy.

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.770
That's the X GDP equal that we have to give on.

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:05.130
Then we say your content equals toe upgrade in secure dash requests.

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.890
This is all what we have to do for the metadata.

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:15.340
So this is going to instruct browsers like Chrome to say that if you've got an http request

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:19.850
using an objects just treated us on its GDP s request,

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:23.470
this is a work around because I don't have control on William J.

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:24.600
B a p a dot com,

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.810
which is an insecure request.

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:31.090
So we still want to make a request because I made some changes over here.

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.920
I have to do a build under deploy again on my command.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:35.400
Prompt.

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.720
I'm gonna type your NPM run build.

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.370
If that is successful,

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:46.320
I have to do fire based deploy now on Windows if this command doesn't work around this

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:52.300
command forced once that commanders over execute the second command on lean exploit forms

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:53.200
on backwards,

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:58.080
you can simply take this coming because it's equal and to say if this command is successful

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.080
,

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.790
then execute the second command.

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:02.550
So let's press enter and see if that's gonna work.

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:08.000
So the build is begun once the production buildings ready.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.700
Now it's actually doing a firebase deploying,

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:16.800
which means it's actually releasing a new abortion off my project with the updated index

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:17.950
dot html file.

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:19.170
And it's done.

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:21.050
If I go back to the browser,

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.950
let's reload this once over here,

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:24.810
Onda.

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:27.780
Now you can see I got the movies without a problem.

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:28.950
There is no editor.

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:29.550
Of course.

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:31.570
I should have removed this console log somewhere.

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:32.940
I'm displaying the props.

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:36.890
Let's click on one of the movie to see if there is a details that I'm getting,

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:39.310
so I do get the details off the movie on.

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:40.560
I can click the back button toe,

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:41.150
go back,

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:45.510
take the movie brother title to go to the homepage on.

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:49.850
I should be able to search for anything else as well without any problem.

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:53.870
This is how you do a deployment off your application.

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:56.300
Now this deployment process is common.

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:58.870
Toe any websites or Web application?

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:05.150
You create nothing specific about the react GIs except that there is a NPM run build you do

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:06.770
before you do the deployment.

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:08.540
That's it for this lecture.

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:10.030
In the subsequent lectures,

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:13.520
let's discuss what is progressive application Allah boat,

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:17.470
and then we can see how we can convert our application in tow,

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:19.400
a Progressive Web application.
