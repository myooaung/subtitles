00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.010
Welcome back in this lecture.

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:08.430
Let's have a look in tow.

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:10.950
What is Google fire based on the boat.

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.280
So I'm gonna open a brand new Google chrome tab and look for Google.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.730
Five days on the first thing that I get.

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.010
I'm gonna click on that on it's going to take me toe a marketing page.

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:25.420
So in here,

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.250
you can work with different kinds off five best products,

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.240
fireplaces,

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.360
a sorry exploded by Google,

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.950
which allows us toe keep our data in the form of some object databases.

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.680
We can do some hosting off for applications.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.050
We can store files.

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.250
We can actually do authentication mechanism using Google Facebook.

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.780
Are any other kinds of social media Loggins,

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.600
including the OTP authentication on?

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.890
There are many features that uploaded by fire base.

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.820
So the first thing that you can see here is that it is good console on.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.690
I purposely loved out off my Gmail account,

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.250
so if I click on it,

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.680
it's gonna ask me toe log in first,

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.670
I'm gonna select my default.

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.840
Using him on bond provided a possible for the same.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.980
And that takes me toe what's called fire based concern.

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:15.030
As you can see,

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.050
I have created many projects in my firebase account.

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.150
When I click on our project last year,

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.260
what's the name of the project you want on?

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.430
Since we're working on a movie brother application,

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.670
I'm gonna type your movie browser.

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.690
What it also does It gives a unique i d for my application,

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.010
which has this some kind of hash number.

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:38.500
This is gonna be my website name are perfect to my website.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.480
So it's gonna be like movie browser.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:41.630
Dash five,

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.350
UFC 80 Dog sideways actor come if I want.

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.950
I can customize this by removing this But then,

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:49.320
of course,

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.450
if I tried to save it says that it's already taken by someone else.

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.180
Probably I can take your React dash movie browser.

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.780
It is even that is also taken by someone.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.970
So I'm gonna just a pure the edgiest dash movie browser,

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.230
which is available for now.

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:06.120
If you want,

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.800
you can also assign a custom domain name,

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.650
which you may have to pay for to this particular project.

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.070
Let's click on save Continue.

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:16.390
It also asked,

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.060
Do you want to enable Google Analytics for your fight with project for this project?

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.730
I don't want but in practice if you want to target analysis off various kinds,

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.340
so you may enable that.

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.960
But for now,

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.730
I don't want I just click on this check box.

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.970
Click on Create Project Onda.

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.610
In a minute or less,

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.210
the project is created,

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.190
so the project is really let's click on the Continue.

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.130
Now you can see it has taken me to my project Dashboard.

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.870
Over here my product is listed along with the other projects that I have here,

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.670
which I can switch between.

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:51.510
So but for now,

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.070
I want the movie brother itself.

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:57.020
As you can see that there are different services provided by Google Fire Base.

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:04.220
Authentication is really you can enable social media are lugging based on email and

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.050
password are even the OTP authentication Also,

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.790
All right,

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:14.000
provides that database so which is basically a bunch off objects that you can store and

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.510
then the Trib,

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:15.900
using some quietly language.

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:22.260
There is also fine stories you have like if you have some requirement for storing huge find

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:22.260
,

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:23.550
you can use this service.

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:25.550
But this is what we want to use,

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:26.610
which is the hosting.

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:31.630
So we want our Web application to be hosted on Google's cloud platform over here.

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:33.640
So this is what we want to go on.

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.590
There is also something called Functions which allows us to create our own rest full

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:39.500
website visas.

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.800
So if I click on the hosting,

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.960
it's going to give me more details off.

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.700
How can I get started with this?

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.590
Since this is a brand new hosting,

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.130
it doesn't show anything over here,

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:51.630
except there is they're getting started a link.

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:52.710
When I click on that,

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:56.000
it says here you have to first install what Scott,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.720
Fire based See Alive,

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.840
which is a command line interface on It's nothing but a bunch of firebase tools.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.470
This is the first step that we have to do.

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:05.890
Once that is done,

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.400
we have to initialize the project and deploy our project.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.420
So three steps,

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.310
which is what we're gonna do in the subsequent lectures.

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.970
So that's it for this lecture or see you in the next one
