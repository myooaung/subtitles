00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.250
Welcome back in this lecture.

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:12.880
Let's create a icon for our movie browser application on.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.800
You can create an image using any tools that you're comfortable bit.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:18.550
Now.

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:23.780
I don't want to go with more complicated tools like photo shop or illustrator.

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:25.180
It's a trunk from Adobe.

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.030
I just want to keep it very,

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:27.750
very simple.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.950
I'm using here something called Keynote,

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:36.650
which is equal and off Microsoft ballpoint on Windows So you can do that are you can use

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:38.830
any image that's available on the Internet.

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:40.150
If you want to skip this,

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:41.800
please go into the same things.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.220
At the end of this particular lecture,

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:48.660
I would have simply created a image and then convert that imagine to the icons that we want

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.470
for our progressive obligation.

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:55.080
The first thing that I want to do is to go to the document properties off this particular

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:55.850
for the addition.

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:57.190
The slide says.

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:58.120
Here it is standard,

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:58.940
for by three,

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.580
I can customize this toe pixel,

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:07.460
which is 512 by Final 12 and that's all what I am going to do on.

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.780
I don't need this double click to edit placeholders.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:11.210
In fact,

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.550
I can change the master toe a blank one,

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.350
or I could have simply deleted that.

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.490
So the first thing I'm gonna do is to make this background look black.

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:22.840
So that's the first thing.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:23.780
Easiest one.

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.680
And then I'm gonna add a white color shape over here to this corner.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.200
Make it little smaller.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.860
Convert that into a white background.

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.120
So daily Go on.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.540
I'm going to duplicate this by pressing command.

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:39.410
E Andi.

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:41.480
I have a 2nd 1 I'm going to sell it.

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.420
Both of them do another duplicate on this process.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.530
I think I'm gonna repeat this for till I go across this particular one.

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.520
I think I can add one more over here.

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.750
So that's just added like this on.

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.510
Probably I can shift this a bit like this.

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:00.310
Basically,

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.170
what I'm trying to do is to make it look like a film role.

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:08.850
So one more duplicate on then artist at this particular side,

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.020
so they should be good on.

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.840
I just want to adhere the letters T m and B for movie browser.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.450
So I'm gonna add a text on the text is in a black color by default.

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.650
So let's adhere and capital be small.

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.190
I can't see that because it's black.

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.620
So I'm gonna change the text color toe.

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:35.310
Let's say white are probably a sign Increase the phone stays to say,

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.140
for example,

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:37.210
let's try 100.

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:39.250
See how that the 100 is not enough.

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.030
I'm gonna go and make it as 200.

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.240
Should be okay,

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:49.690
so I'm gonna just rotate that Probably a bit something like this on my icon.

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.380
Now it's already This is what I wanted.

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:58.470
All I have to do now is toe export this to an image as a gym pick fight.

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:03.350
I call this as can be on and stay export.

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.320
So it's on documents,

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:06.350
so it is done.

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:07.800
So let's see the image.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:14.320
I'm going to minimize this and then I go toe new finder on under document against the MBI

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.670
on the MBI 0.1 dot jp.

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:23.650
And it's a fight 12 by fight Well on its a nice icon recreated in a few minutes.

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.780
We have this gym pic file,

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.410
but we want to convert this into an icon off different sizes.

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:30.980
Like a favor icon,

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:31.590
for example,

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:38.790
will be off 16 by 16 32 by 32 64 by 64 so on for mobile applications.

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.230
When it is added to home screen,

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.520
it will require a different size to convert our J pic filing toe icons.

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:51.650
Let's go to the browser on a visit a website called Really Favor icon generator dot net Not

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:56.100
this is one off many many websites available to create such favor.

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:00.050
Icons on I'll have to do is to select my image,

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:01.670
which is under documents.

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.790
That's the image that I have now that's gonna upload that on gender.

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.490
It varieties are filed for me.

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:09.550
So as you can see,

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:13.560
this is how it's gonna look like on browser on a Dark,

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:18.170
a team that so it's gonna look like which is okay for me on a desktop that have it's gonna

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:19.130
look like on a mobile.

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.540
This how it's gonna look like There is also some customization to some extent you can make

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.540
.

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.080
If you wanted to be around it,

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.470
radios and stuff like that.

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.190
I don't want to do any off these changes.

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:30.840
I want to leave it everything to default.

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.880
So this is how it's gonna look like on,

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.190
and I always do wise on a android mobile phone.

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:37.700
If you have a Microsoft phone.

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.040
That's how it's gonna look like.

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.710
Ofcourse,

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:41.150
all of these are customizable.

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:45.250
I hope you will play around with the same onda somewhere at the bottom.

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:46.200
You have an option toe,

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.560
gender,

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:47.160
your favor,

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.020
icons on its female court.

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:50.510
Let's click on that.

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:54.320
It's actually generating on the background On in a minute.

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:58.030
I will get a link here toe download that zip file.

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.050
So here is my favorite can package.

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:04.240
I'm gonna download the same thing on toe the documents folder again,

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.350
where we have our other actual files.

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.030
So I click on Save On.

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:12.740
Now we have the favor icon dot zip generated.

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:18.250
Let's unzip the same thing on Goto the Documents folder.

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:21.730
So here is my favorite con package,

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:23.760
which consists off all the files,

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:29.210
and the important ones for us is the 1 90 to 1 92 p and G.

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:30.570
There is a fight well,

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:31.160
by fight well,

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:32.880
PNG apple touch.

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:33.910
I conduct Angie.

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:36.650
That's important for Apple devices.

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:38.820
There is a fair icon.

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:40.880
I think this is the only one that I'm reused,

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:41.430
but if you want,

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:43.380
you can also use others as well.

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:46.390
So this is the one that contains 48 by 48.

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:47.710
Say's effectively.

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:50.230
I need the 1st 1 second.

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:54.630
1/3 1 on the favor I conduct I see will find.

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:57.340
So these are the different fights that I want.

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:00.700
I can copy these things and then go to my application,

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:03.050
which is on desktop reacted demo.

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:09.860
And there is a public on I can actually dump on the files over here itself.

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:12.600
You can see that there is already a default favorite Conrad.

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:12.930
I see.

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:13.140
Well,

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:14.090
I don't need that.

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:16.810
There is a local 1 92 I don't need that.

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:18.180
There's a logo fight.

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:18.530
Well,

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:19.660
I don't need them,

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:27.170
so I'm gonna delete them by right click and say Moto been on then I'm also going toe based

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:29.940
my files that I copied from the other folder.

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:35.420
Now that we have got our icons required for application in the next lecture,

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:37.950
let's see how to use them in the manifest.

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:38.750
Our chase on
