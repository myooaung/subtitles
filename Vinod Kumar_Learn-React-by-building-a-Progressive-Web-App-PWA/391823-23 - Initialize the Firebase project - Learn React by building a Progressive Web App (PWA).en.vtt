00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.010
Welcome back in this lecture,

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:11.890
let's initialize the fire based project on our working folders.

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:15.240
So it's very important that you are in the current project directory.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.270
So I'm unclear and then see,

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:18.210
where am I right now?

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:24.550
On notice that I am on my project directly where there is a packaged or Jason and that's

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:25.270
important.

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:30.900
You must be in your project folder to do the subsequent commands on the commended I want to

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.390
do is tow fire based in it.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.620
This is a one time command on this is gonna ask you a few questions,

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.340
create a couple of files.

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.240
One of them is called Fire Base.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:46.300
Are Syria today he didn't find like dark firebase RC on will be a second file called Fire

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.540
Best Start Chase on,

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.960
which consists off all the information that we're gonna keen over here so we can always

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:53.570
edit them.

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.290
So let's press enter on.

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.940
The first thing it's gonna ask you is what kind off projects that you want to work with on

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.310
this is like check boxes.

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:03.750
So be careful over here.

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:04.370
Don't pressed.

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:06.550
Enter until selected something.

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:11.310
So if you want to work with multiple fire based services such as authentication or

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.980
databases,

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:12.430
etcetera.

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.990
So you can choose different ones.

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.980
But in my case,

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:18.050
I want to use only the hosting.

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:22.780
I have toe use the arrow keys to select something and then press space.

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:23.540
Balto,

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:24.450
highlight the same.

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.350
You can see it says,

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.650
Hey,

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.400
you have chosen hosting.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.160
If you want,

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.770
you can again press the space,

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.500
Balto Unpick the same.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.230
And I'm going to stay like the same thing.

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:35.090
And then I'm gonna press enters.

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.150
This is the only thing that I want to use right now.

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:38.620
So it's gonna ask,

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:43.670
Do you want to create a new fire based project all they want to use an existing one on In

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:44.600
the previous lecture,

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.230
we created a fire best project on That's what we want to use.

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:52.530
So let's they use an existing project press entered on.

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.340
This is gonna list out all of them that are currently available on the one that I want to

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.850
use is basically the movie browser react.

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.140
GIs projects timeless.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:02.910
Crawl down.

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:04.690
Using the R key on.

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:08.640
You can see that there is a react jest movie browser project.

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.100
So I press enter.

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:15.800
Then it'll ask you which folder contains your deployment content.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.460
If you remember when we created a production build,

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:22.320
we had something called Billed as a folder on.

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:27.600
You can See It on my screen right here There is a folder called Build that contains all the

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:28.870
files that we want to deploy.

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.290
I So that's all I have to do by default.

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.810
It was expecting a public folder because that's the general convention.

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.330
But reactors build the tool has created a fuller called build.

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.950
I just started.

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.160
Type the name off that now,

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.970
Since my folder already contains something,

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.520
there may be a warning message later.

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:47.500
So in this case,

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.860
it's asking configure as a single page application.

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:51.280
Now,

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.890
this is really very important because every request that we send back toe the remote server

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.980
will be redirected back to the index dot html,

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.250
where the objects will take control and update or parts whenever you're working with a

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:05.410
single page application.

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:06.190
This is really,

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.970
really important.

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.450
Let's say yes over here on the next thing it asked is that Hey,

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:11.830
Bill,

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:13.980
the slash index dot html already exist.

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.250
You want all right here we should send No,

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.070
because if you say yes,

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:19.560
the index dot HTML,

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.340
which was created by the edges earlier,

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.350
will now be placed on some kind of a dummy.

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.250
Static content will be kept over here.

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:28.830
We don't want that to happen.

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:30.160
You send no here.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.750
But if you say yes accidentally,

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.840
you might have to create a build again.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.350
So I would say no.

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.570
I believe that there is nothing else to this.

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:41.330
You can see it has successfully initialized the project,

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:44.650
and now we are ready to deploy our project.

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.670
So that's it for this lecture.

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:48.230
In the next lecture,

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:54.590
let's do the actual deployment off our application onto Google Fire Base and then our Web

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.700
application is available on the Internet on.

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.850
Anybody in the world can access the same thing.
