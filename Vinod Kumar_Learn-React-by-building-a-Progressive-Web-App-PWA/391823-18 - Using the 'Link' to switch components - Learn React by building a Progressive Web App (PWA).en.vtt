00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.110
Welcome back.

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:09.020
Now we want to provide a link toe.

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:13.310
This particular title that's the general practice when you click on their diarrhea,

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:15.710
is you go back to the home page,

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:18.300
which is nothing but our local host.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.450
3000 slash are just 3000.

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:23.710
Right now that's not working.

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:25.000
So if I click on this,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.370
you can see it is not working.

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:30.140
I have to provide some hyperlink over there now.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.610
The problem.

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:31.370
Diaper link.

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:35.690
We have actually a component called the Link on.

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.060
Let's go back to the header component over here.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:39.310
This is where we have the hits,

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:43.090
three movies and we want to provide a hyperlink over here,

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:44.200
and it's very simple.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.020
Ask for a a component called Link,

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:54.760
which is coming from reactor Odom Andi all have to do is to surround this movie brother

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:00.150
text using a tag called The Link and then view that text.

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:01.750
But then we have to say link.

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.090
So where?

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.220
So we just sort of say two equals toe slash,

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.630
and that's all we have to do This.

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:14.650
Also biting for brings an underlying because it's going to be converted into a a headdress

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:15.740
and by default,

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.700
the A tariff will always have an underlying.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.640
You can see that there is an underlying over here,

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.450
but clicking that anywhere takes me over there without any problem.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:24.660
No patri lord,

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.350
but the company gets changed.

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.210
And if I don't want that underline,

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.220
I just had to add a style on.

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.090
I'm gonna just adhere a style.

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:33.220
And remember,

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.330
style is an expression which takes an object.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.830
So the first pair of curly brackets here represents that It's an expression like what we

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:41.910
have done over here.

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:45.990
But the second pair of calibrated now represents an object,

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.320
and the object is supposed to have the CSS properties.

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.930
I have to say here texture,

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:51.720
decoration,

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.050
and then I'll say your value off none indicating I don't need any extra decoration.

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.040
So don't get confused that there is a double college record like If you're coming from

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.690
angular or view Jay's,

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:07.400
you'll see that the Biblical record represents a kind of an expression here.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.390
It is only saying that hit this is an object,

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.320
and that object has a property value off text decoration,

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.690
and none on that object is further there,

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.350
an expression toe style attribute.

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.770
So I saved this and go back to the rosary concede that the underlying is gone.

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.350
It still is a hyper Lincoln.

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.560
That's why we see that fingertip over here.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.560
So I'm gonna just type your Spiderman and pressed.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.080
Enter.

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.990
We got it.

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:33.320
I click on this.

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.970
I go back to the homepage on That's the end off this lecture.

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.170
In the next lecture,

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:44.190
let's see one more component where when we click on a particular movie,

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.750
I want to get the complete details about this particular movie.
