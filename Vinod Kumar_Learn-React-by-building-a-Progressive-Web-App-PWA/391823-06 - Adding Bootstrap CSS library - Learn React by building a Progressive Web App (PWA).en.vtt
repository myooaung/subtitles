00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.110
Welcome back in this lecture.

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:09.660
Let's have a look at how toe beautify our application.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.520
Using a CSS framework called bootstrap.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.880
Bushed Up is a framework doublet by developers that Twitter.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.850
And it's the most popular CSS remark used and loud by millions of developers.

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:28.120
Now there are a couple of different ways to add this to your application Number one.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.450
You can goto the download section over here,

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:36.040
and they are given how you can include this into your application.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.660
They're given here.

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.650
Compile CSS and JavaScript files you can download.

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.180
This is a ZIP file and then use them alternately.

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.140
You can defer Toe stadion,

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.380
which is the content delivery network that means you are.

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.960
Application refers to a CSS file hosted by 1/3 party website.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.650
Then you can also use NPM,

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:01.290
install bootstrap and then start using the same thing in our application.

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:06.250
But all this files referred to the default styling provided by Bootstrap,

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.340
which is okay to some extent.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.510
But if you want tohave more colorful us,

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.200
you may have to tweak the CSS.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.800
The good news is there is a website called boots watch,

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:23.160
and there are many such bootstrap teams are available But this is the one that I've been

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:24.800
using it for quite some time,

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.550
and I'm quite happy with this.

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:28.110
But they use a remain the same thing.

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.840
So if I scroll down over here,

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.480
you can see that they have given different teams.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.030
You'll be using the same CSS class names floated by the bootstrap.

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.370
Because these teams have modified the CSS,

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:44.170
you will see the same application looking completely different.

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:45.110
So what you can do,

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.840
they can choose the one that looks nice to you.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.380
And then you can just download that file and then keep it in your public folder,

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.420
for example.

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.300
I would like to use this for this demonstration I'll have to do is to click on the download

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.300
,

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:03.460
but it's going to download the bootstrap that mean dot CSS fine.

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:11.020
Andi on my desktop I have this react demo folder inside that you can see there's a public

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.550
folder,

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.350
but I'm gonna just keep that file.

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.890
Bootstrap,

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:21.930
Darkman Dark CSS right inside that click on Save and then come back to my via scored Go to

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:22.860
the index,

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:23.660
Alex Yemen,

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:29.610
on the refer to this boat start mean dot CSS so I can go and add a link tax somewhere in

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:30.190
the beginning.

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:31.030
It's like,

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:36.660
great here link and then press enter Know that I'm not used a less than symbol.

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:43.920
So we're scored automatically acts the link attack with the 11 absolutes Onda edge of

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:50.240
corresponds to the files I just had to say here either dot slash all I can simply type

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:55.230
bootstrap dot min dot CSS As soon as I saved this,

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.010
the application is ready.

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.610
Safer?

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.070
Go back to the browser and look at my application.

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.530
You can see that the background color has been changed.

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:03.850
The front off.

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.450
This also has changed.

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.070
That's it for this lecture.

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:08.470
In the next lecture,

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.450
let's start building our application by creating components.
