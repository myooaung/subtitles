00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.030
Welcome back in this lecture.

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:13.380
Let's see how we can handle this quietly String perimeter in a single page application.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.160
So,

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:14.800
in other words,

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.270
in the movie list component,

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:20.500
we want to be ableto read the value for search text,

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.560
which I'm giving it a spider man notice.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.940
We generally don't want to type it on that just for directly,

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:31.360
but we want to supply it from this text box that will do in the subsequent lectures.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:32.520
But for the time being,

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.870
we should be able to read this quietest ing perimeter to do so.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:37.560
First,

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:44.200
let's go to our movie list component and notice that our movie list component is a state

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.990
full component or a class based component.

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:49.550
It has couple of building properties.

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.660
Number one is the state which we have created over here.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.400
There is a 2nd 1 which is called Props,

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:02.480
which is an object representing all the properties passed from the parent component.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:02.940
Now,

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:03.370
in this case,

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.820
the movie listed instance rated in app.

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.240
So here it is instance,

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:12.060
created in case if some properties were passed along with this,

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.880
what are those props?

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.280
We can access them here.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:16.480
So for the time being,

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.250
I'm just going to go toe console,

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.150
Log off this start props,

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.740
and we'll also say that this dark props is well,

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:26.040
actually,

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.510
we're tryingto print over here,

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:28.730
save this,

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:34.100
go back or toe the browser and then go to the console and you can see that it is there is

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.450
something called history location.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.290
And then there is that match on.

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:44.770
These are the properties that came up automatically because now we have included browser

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.000
rotor for the entire application.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.920
One of the interesting aspect again see here is that location is a property that represents

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.750
an object that consists off the part name that is slash movies.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.450
That's a larger part here.

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.850
There is also a such property which contains the entire quarter string.

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.570
So in case if I got something else here,

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.570
even that also would have been included over here and then there is something all hash or

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:12.550
state editor.

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:19.540
Now it is our responsibility toe extract the value for this particular search text on,

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:25.000
then process that now that going to be a difficult to task by ourselves if I want to do

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.270
because there could be multiple parameters first of all have to remove this question mark.

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:34.420
Then Otto split that using an percent because multiple parameters would be separated using

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:35.070
an percent.

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:39.950
And then I have toe extract the value off search text and that would contain some.

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.250
You are all included characters like plus,

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:43.770
which represents a space.

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.500
So all these things we have to do,

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.340
which would be a tough task.

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.460
So instead,

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:52.990
we can depend on 1/3 party AP a called quality String.

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.810
So first,

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.850
let's go to our concern.

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:02.380
Install this NPM package called Query String like this,

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.110
and it's going to take a minute or less on installs.

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.370
The quite a string on this has a function called parts,

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:15.000
which can convert a choir restoring into an object consisting off a bunch of name value

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.470
pairs.

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.540
So since this is now ready,

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:24.100
let's go back to our code import Qari String from Quality Dash String.

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.650
That's the one that we wanted.

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.120
And this is where we don't want the world part.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.610
But we want to get the actual value from the quietest Inc perimeters.

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:40.270
So I'm gonna say here quite a string dot parse And then we say here this start props.

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:42.400
We remember we had the props,

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.210
Props actually has a property called location.

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:49.580
We saw that over here on location as a properly called search.

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:55.550
So where the savior this dark props dot location dart search on.

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:58.630
That's the actual name that is given now that imprisoned.

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.290
His entire string like question marks.

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:01.730
Search takes that separates enter.

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.140
The result.

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:07.570
Off this part is an object on Let's call this sq.

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:11.840
So Q is an object that represents all the quite distinct perimeter now on.

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.150
We wanted the value off the perimeter called search text,

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:17.350
so we simply have to say,

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:20.170
You're que dot search text now.

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.940
So Q.

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:26.880
Is the result off this parsing that may contain multiple name value pairs in our kids?

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.210
We have only one on.

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.480
We're extracting that one single value now.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.300
So as soon a they say this.

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:33.790
If I go back to the browser,

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:34.760
not that currently,

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.530
test Spider Man here and then we got all the Spiderman.

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:38.270
So you should,

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.440
in spite of money for type your island man,

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:41.930
I should get on the island.

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.670
Man movies are if I say search text equals toe tart.

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:48.920
I should get all the tar movies from there,

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:50.500
so that's it for this lecture.

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:51.760
In the next lecture,

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.990
let's link this text box to this movie list.

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:57.830
So whatever you're gonna type and such,

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.360
that is a movie that you want to see over here.
