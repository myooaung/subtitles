00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.080
Welcome back in this lecture.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.760
Let's understand Waters routing on single page applications on a boat.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.630
Here is an example of a single page application,

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:15.700
which is Jimmy,

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.210
You can see under address Bar.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:26.050
It says you're hash inbox because of which were able to see all my inbox content inside

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:27.090
this particular area.

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.590
However,

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.210
if I change that inbox toe chats,

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.980
either by clicking this year are manually typing that you can t.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.790
Now it's showing me all the charts in my Gmail account.

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.540
So the inbox is gone.

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:49.170
Charts come back if I click on stand or if I'd changes to spam manually and entered,

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:55.260
you concede that the area where the church were displayed is now being populated with all

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.750
the Stan content and likewise,

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.950
the draft or trash,

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:01.270
you can check everything.

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:05.410
The word here is the route part,

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:11.170
so whatever the part information apart identifies what component to be displayed in this

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:12.000
particular section.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.510
So in any single bail application,

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:21.380
you have an area off your application that dynamically changes based on the part that is

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:22.750
available on the address bar.

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.920
So in our application,

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:25.900
for example,

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:33.650
the slash R locals 3000 should display me the home page where if I type here slash movies,

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.430
I should get this particular movie list.

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.450
But probably if I say slash details,

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.710
then I want to get details off a particular movie to do this year.

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.530
Toe first install a new package called React Rotor Dom.

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:50.570
So let's go and do that.

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.670
First I go to the command prompt.

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.090
In this new tab,

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.780
I'm going to type your NPM.

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.050
I make sure that you're in your current working directory,

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:00.270
which is a project directory,

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.980
and then type your NPM I for install.

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.150
React rotor dom.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:07.930
When you press enter again,

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:12.530
it's going to take a minute or less and installs this dependency adds to the package dot

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:13.490
Jason as well.

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:18.820
You may ignore these editors because NPM install is trying to install in different means

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.320
and finally it a choose installation.

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:22.510
Off react Roto.

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:23.670
Don't fight at wonder,

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:24.060
too.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.260
Let's go verify the same thing in the packaged or Jason as well.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:28.910
You can see that there they react,

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:29.520
voted on.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.070
That's added.

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.940
Now on,

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:36.390
let's go to the Abdullah Gs and then import a couple of things from here.

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:43.790
So the first thing we're gonna do is tow import from react Router dom on What we won't do

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:49.030
here is either something called as browser rotor or a hash shelter.

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.970
Hi,

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.480
shoulder all those us toe our hash like this one.

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:54.550
Now,

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:55.130
if you want,

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.870
you can use that,

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.050
but somehow if you use this,

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.950
it will affect your search engine optimization.

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:02.700
So let's not use that.

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.710
So let's come back and use what's called browser rotor,

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:09.590
and the browser rotor is like a component.

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.310
We can use it like HTML tags,

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.050
and then we also one more component called Route that defines a route.

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.920
So in any single page application using react,

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:26.900
you need to surround the entire application using this browser outer component.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:34.150
So I'm gonna open the bag here and then close this slash broza rotor after this one.

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:40.500
So that's the first part in my application on the 2nd 1 is where I want to define a couple

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.620
of roads over here saying that,

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.900
Hey,

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.030
if the part is slash,

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.350
then rendered a home component,

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:49.720
if it is called movies,

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.330
then I want it as a movie list component.

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:53.190
To do that,

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.850
let's get off this movie list and then adhere a route.

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:04.190
And then we said particles toe slash indicating If you haven't visited anything other than

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:06.420
the homepage Onda,

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.940
we also type your exact equals two.

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:14.910
True on this is to indicate that there is nothing else other than the SLASH because slash

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.250
is gonna be part off every part.

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:22.470
We want to say that the component to be instance hated is the home component.

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:23.460
So that's it.

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.690
Nothing else and the same thing I can copy,

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:30.790
Paste option shift to down Arrow are all shift down at her to duplicate the same thing on

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:31.340
this time.

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.360
I want to say that if this is called movies,

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.230
we don't need to add the exactly close to true.

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:41.290
But component is gonna be movie list component,

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:46.450
So let's save this and go back to the browser on.

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:51.450
You can see now that I'm taken toe the homepage instead of the movie list.

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:57.760
But I can always come down here and then type your slash movies and then press enter on.

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.740
Now we can see we got the movie list component.

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:01.180
So again,

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.190
if I remove this movies and then percenter,

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:06.180
I should be taken toe the homepage.

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:09.250
So this is what the routing Allah boat.

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:14.760
But one more thing that we also want to do is that when you are getting the movies,

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:19.750
we may also want to specify something like search text equals to say,

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:20.680
for example,

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.270
Spider Man.

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:23.760
When a press enter,

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:27.050
I should be able to supply this Spiderman.

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:29.180
Why are this particular third sticks?

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:32.870
Which is a quite distinct perimeter to the movie list component,

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:37.830
Which is what is working behind the theme but a distance since we haven't done this.

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:40.780
So the Spiderman is not going to come up.

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:46.760
It's still going to show me the car movies because this is not received by movie list,

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:49.430
and this is what we want to do in the next lecture.

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:50.990
So that's it for this lecture.
