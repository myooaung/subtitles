00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.070
welcome back in this lecture.

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:09.920
Let's create another component called home component.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:10.860
For that,

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.870
let's go toe the components folder.

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.450
Create a new file called home dot JSX.

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:18.560
And this time,

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.270
unlike the Header J six,

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:21.160
we would be created.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.160
A class based component will create a function based component.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.070
Let's use I am are snippet toe,

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.350
get the import react from react.

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:32.990
We need this for JSX.

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:37.940
We won't be requiring the component because we're not creating a class that inherit from

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:38.550
component.

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.120
But instead let's create a function called home,

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.580
which takes as off No,

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:44.620
no barometers.

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.660
But this could take some parameters also.

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:56.030
And this has a return statement that consist off do slash Do finally we have to do an

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.000
export and then we say default home.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.380
So when we use the import statement in,

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:04.160
for example,

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.510
Abdur Js that we want to get everything from home,

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:13.670
this is what actually is imported that instead of creating a function using the function

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.690
key word we can use that year six out of functions for day.

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.850
So I'm gonna remove this function and take const.

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.020
And this becomes a variable.

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.390
Now I have toe assign something to that and what I'm gonna assign.

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.410
It's supposed to be a function on.

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:32.470
All I have to do is to give the perimeter list on,

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.640
then adult in the form off equals two.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.900
Great,

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:35.210
then.

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.790
So now this becomes a very simple function.

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:44.150
And in case if the function has only a return statement and nothing else,

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:50.330
you can simply use this return statement itself as the body off this particular function

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:51.600
like this.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.990
Now there's the more simpler approach saying that hit this the function named with the

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.020
variable called home.

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.130
And then we're exporting that home here.

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.380
Now let's have some content inside our home.

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.060
So if I go back toe the view here So basically,

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.230
in this component,

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:10.240
I want tohave.

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.460
Three different sections are three columns with the first,

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.550
and the last column is just a dummy.

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.450
And the center section is where I would like to have some kind of photograph and they're

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.940
heading Probably some description.

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.520
So to do that,

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.650
let's go back and add a class name off row here,

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:37.650
make sure you use class name and not class like this on this is gonna have three columns.

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.880
No,

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.090
I can say dot call Dash MB four,

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.290
which means in a medium do is it's gonna occupy four grades,

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.580
but in an extra small and a small device.

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.160
I want this to occupy the full word,

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.880
so I can say dot call Dash excess 12 and I want the three off them.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.760
So I'm gonna multiply that with three.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.300
So you can see here.

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:05.390
We're gonna get our three deals with the exact same class names I'm gonna pressed enter.

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.840
And we got three different lives over here.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.240
Like I said,

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.130
the 1st 1 on the last one.

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:13.810
I want this to be just a dummy.

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.200
Do the center section is what I want to use here.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.050
Let's copy and paste an image from one of my folders.

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:22.170
I'm gonna go in tow.

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:23.340
My finder.

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.970
I have here a pictures folder.

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.150
I have a bunch off my pictures over here.

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:30.430
I'm going to select one off them.

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.970
So this is the one that I'm gonna use and then right click and copy this picture.

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.250
And then on my desktop,

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.180
I have here react demo application on.

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.470
I'm gonna copy and paste that in the public folder,

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:48.950
create a new folder called Imagers and then inside that I'm gonna paste it.

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.220
Now that's named,

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.620
as we know Dash four.

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.710
So I'm gonna rename this as we know dot chipping.

00:03:55.710 --> 00:04:01.250
So it's been copied toe my public folded over here on the images.

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:02.160
I have this picture.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.430
Andi,

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.870
I'm gonna use that picture right here.

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:16.620
So I'd say I am G onda SRC equals two slash images slash We know dot chipping all probably

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:17.590
is my name.

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.530
We know from our car tire.

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.510
And then I can also add some class names to that.

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:28.580
So let's had a class name called I AMG AMG Company.

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.970
Let's also add some headings right below that I'm going to say,

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:33.080
Here it's tree.

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:40.740
Let's a movie browser application And then I can say here are a paragraph that says

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:47.720
followed by React genius 16.13 dot zero,

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.560
and that the Washington we're using,

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:55.270
one more thing I want to do is tow Align the content inside this do in the center so I can

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:58.050
simply type your text center.

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:03.500
We now have a new component that has a bunch of content,

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.690
but we haven't used it anywhere here.

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:10.950
So now remember the whole page here is a result off the component called APP,

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:13.720
that currently has only the header as a child.

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:18.890
So what we want to do now is to go to the app Georgie s where we just have the header.

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:25.380
We can just add one more here saying I have a component called home that I want to use,

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:28.850
so it is automatically imported from the home.

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:29.750
George a six.

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:30.880
Let's save this.

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:36.790
Go back to the browser on you can see that we got the movie brother app Home page.

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:38.070
So that's it.

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:44.850
For this lecture we created a home component which is a function based component.

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:47.820
This is also called as a stateless component.

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:52.900
You create a at a function ascender to variable and then export the same thing.
