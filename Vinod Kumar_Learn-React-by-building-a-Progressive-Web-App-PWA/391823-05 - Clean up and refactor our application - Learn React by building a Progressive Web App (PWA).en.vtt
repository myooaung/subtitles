00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.200
Welcome back in this lecture.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.300
Let's do some clean up on re factoring or for application.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.800
A lot off court that we got earlier,

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:14.810
for example,

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:15.760
Abd urges,

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:21.550
is the one that is being used by my index charges on the index or Jace is the starting

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:21.910
point.

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:23.360
So if I go to index dot Js,

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.410
you can see here it is some import react from react,

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.560
and this line is required whenever you have some JSX.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.750
If you don't have J six,

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.900
it's not a requirement at all.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:39.310
Now anything that looks like an example inside off your job a skirt.

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:41.350
And that's basically J six.

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:48.260
The second import here says reacted Dom from a package called React Down Over Here.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.170
And that's used because we have here something called React on dot Orender.

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.460
So what's basically happening is that we are asking React jizz toe.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:03.420
Look for this element in our index dot html on the index selects similar is inside the

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.250
public folder.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.550
Over here and in the index alleged email,

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:08.090
you can see the lots of comments.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.800
We can get it off All the unwanted comments.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.460
Let's come back to this commenced later,

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.980
savory more all the command from here,

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:17.750
the actual court looks very,

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:18.470
very simple.

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:24.350
It just has a body slash body with Do whose idea is route.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.630
And this is exactly what we're looking for in our indexed or chase where we say,

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:30.100
Hey,

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.510
David,

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:34.130
an element whose idea is route rendered.

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.770
This particular component called App,

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:43.410
that all this line is all about and this particular component is coming from another file

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:48.440
here and against it dot slash dark slash means In the working directly there is a file

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:55.300
called APP Readjust looks either for a fighter called actor Js or abduct GSX.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.500
Now,

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.170
since we have an abductor Js over here,

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.650
whatever is exported from there will be used as a component.

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.400
In this example,

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.680
you can see that there is a component return using a function.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:10.470
Andi,

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:16.020
I mentioned earlier that we can use a class that the difference within using a class and a

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.590
function,

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:22.110
and there is a scenario where you may have to use only class based components and there is

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.680
a scenario where you may use the function based companies now for practical reasons,

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.020
they're called a state ful and stateless,

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.910
respectively.

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.850
So there's a stateless component.

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.530
So we will come back and discuss about the components.

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.180
And how do we write our own components in a few minutes?

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.650
Later,

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:48.200
But basically indexed or Jace is tryingto create a component using the court given in that

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.550
particular file on there is one more here called salaries worker doubt un register on this

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.030
would be changed.

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.780
It toe surveys worker don't register when we look in tow.

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:04.150
The pw a part of our application the progressive web application for the time being kindly

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:05.450
ignored this part.

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:06.030
All right,

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.480
so now we don't want a couple of things.

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:09.400
For example,

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.610
I don't want this logo dot s sweetie.

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.800
It's an image that was a rotating earlier.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.200
I don't need the indexed or CSS.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.050
I don't need the app tested or just abduct.

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.240
See,

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.800
Assis,

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.860
I don't need the set of tests torches.

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:29.350
So all these files which came upon here I don't need I'm gonna right click on them and then

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:30.140
delete them.

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:35.500
I selected them by using the command key and click on that on Windows.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.350
You can all the control key and keep clicking all the files that you want to delete.

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:41.130
And then I'm gonna delete them.

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:42.140
It's gonna confirm.

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:43.020
I say yes,

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.170
This actually causes a problem if you see that.

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.470
All right.

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:47.850
Now it's giving me an editor.

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:51.260
And it says that here there is no such file called Abduct CSS.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.530
That's because in my Abdullah Js it's being referenced.

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.520
So let's do that cleanup.

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:01.410
So if I goto outdoor Js that is an AB Dorsia says we don't need this anymore.

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.110
I'm gonna press command X on windows.

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:09.340
You press control XTO delete their entire line and in the index charges were using

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.630
something called index start CSS,

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:12.800
which is no longer there,

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.300
so we can remove that.

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:17.490
Now we are ready toe run the Sarwar again.

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:21.340
All I have to do is to save the files that I have over here.

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:23.500
And then if I go back to the browser,

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.150
you should not see that it is hollow react.

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:27.750
My styling is gone,

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.700
but the application is to running.

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:35.990
One last thing that we will do is tow organise all our components inside a folder called

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.680
Component.

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.330
So we can easily identify where are our components because eventually you're gonna have

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:41.650
lots and lots of files.

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.700
It's good idea toe arrange them in a folder.

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:51.130
So I'm gonna create a folder under SRC called Components I can take on this icon over here

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:56.360
to say New folder or I can right click here and then say New folder on the name of the

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.720
folder.

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.950
I want toe Call it us components.

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:01.180
And once it's done,

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:06.570
I'm gonna drag and drop this app digest inside that particular holder.

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:08.650
So it's a move,

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:10.210
and we escort also says,

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:10.670
Hey,

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:16.650
you may have used Abdullah Jess in multiple places doing update that I'll say yes.

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:19.920
And if I go back to the indexed R J s now,

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:26.310
it should ideally have said dark slash component slash AP automatically got updated.

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:32.210
Let's save this and see if there is reflected in our application on the browser and you can

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:35.110
see the application is working perfectly.

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:35.640
All right.

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:41.580
One other thing that we will do before we conclude this particular lecturer is toe set up a

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:43.160
via scored extension.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.970
So click on this icon over here,

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:49.090
which is a bunch of extensions that be a school.

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:54.350
All those is to add the lots and lots off extension that are available on the net.

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:57.710
Some of them have been already installed on my V s.

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:58.060
Good.

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:01.640
All you do is to search for the world react,

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:02.250
Jess.

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:05.290
So if I'm looking for react,

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:08.010
you can see that I already have.

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:09.200
Got this.

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:13.760
The AG nitty react readapt snippets for year six year seven.

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:14.520
Now,

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:17.940
this is something that I've been using it from quite some time,

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:19.320
and I'm okay with this.

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:22.150
Very useful snippets are defined over here,

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:23.000
for example,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.480
by simply typing the world I am are and pressing.

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:27.070
Enter.

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:29.030
You should get the import react.

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:33.830
I am are all I am RC something useful like CCS,

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:37.120
which creates a component class that lots and lots of them are Bill.

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:38.790
But I'm only going to use you off them.

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:44.680
So all you have to do is to click on the install button when it's available over here.

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:47.670
Make sure that you have selected react natively act.

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:48.080
Relax,

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:48.600
snippets.

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:52.620
You may wish to explore other extensions also,

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:54.870
but I'm not using them in my training here.

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:57.340
But if you want to follow along with me,

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:58.970
this is what I'm using.

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:01.740
Once you install that,

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:03.780
now you can work with this.

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:06.850
So So let's just check it out how this works.

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:13.750
I'm gonna go back to my abduct Js I'm gonna delete this line and then simply type Here I am

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:19.050
are and then press enter and you can see we got this import react from the act.

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:22.800
If I want to convert this inter class based component,

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:28.730
I'm going to delete the enter function happened the export different and I'll simply type

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:35.380
here C c s press enter you can t automatically It picks up the name of the class from the

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:38.960
name of the file on the final game on the class name.

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:44.630
We generally keep it same although that is not necessary How the word the class name must

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:50.580
start with a capital letter That's important extends component on Not that the component

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:52.060
did not come over here.

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:59.070
So instead off this which I got from I am are ill type your I am RC and press enter and we

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:04.870
got this import the act on and component from the act and it has got something called state

00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:06.450
at this time We don't need that.

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:08.600
But let's say for example,

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:13.180
I would like to have your a message as a variable on.

00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:16.680
Then let's give it us Hello.

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:22.850
React and put a couple of exclamations so that we know that the method is coming from here

00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:29.240
and there they render function for every component class which is supposed to return a JSX

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:29.860
on.

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:30.300
You see that?

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:32.090
It's giving another here saying that Hey,

00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:33.480
you didn't do it on anything.

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:35.190
So to return something,

00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:36.520
I'm gonna just type deal.

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:38.670
And then inside the day,

00:08:38.670 --> 00:08:40.250
I'm gonna type your which one,

00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:42.980
and inside a cuddly bracket,

00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:47.050
I would like to take this start ST dot message.

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:54.210
Now you can see that the cuddly bracket here is toe get the value off variable inside this

00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:55.250
particular XML.

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:58.100
Please know that you cannot write a job loss,

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:02.210
kept expressions like far loops or if condition inside this,

00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:08.850
it's only to substitute the value off a variable that we use this particular curly bracket

00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:08.850
.

00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:11.760
It's an interpolation that we're doing over here.

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:15.730
A member of the class is always access using this keyword.

00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:17.010
So since stated,

00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:22.010
a member variable off this particular class a member function can access that using the

00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:22.650
disc able.

00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:23.860
So it's a day start state,

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:29.130
and that has a variable called message or property called message we have a value off.

00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:29.450
Hello.

00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:29.870
React.

00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:30.690
So that's what actually,

00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:33.490
we're trying to print inside this hedge one the US,

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:34.600
and save this.

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:36.580
And if I go back to the browser,

00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:38.050
I should now see Hello.

00:09:38.050 --> 00:09:40.160
React with those three exclamations.

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:41.590
That's it for this lecture.

00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:43.180
In the next lecture,

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:47.050
let's add some bootstrap CSS framework.
