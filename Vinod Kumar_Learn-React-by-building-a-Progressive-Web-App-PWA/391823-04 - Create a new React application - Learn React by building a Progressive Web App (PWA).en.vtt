00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.265
Welcome back.

00:00:06.265 --> 00:00:07.990
In this lecture, Let's create

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:10.675
a brand new React JS application

00:00:10.675 --> 00:00:14.350
and see what are the things that are required to start it up.

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:17.380
So I'm on my command prompt here,

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:19.705
which is called terminal on Mac OS.

00:00:19.705 --> 00:00:23.080
And they're currently I'm on my home directory.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.690
I would like to switch to my desktop.

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:28.630
I have absolutely no files on my desktop.

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.700
So if you see our ls minus l,

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.560
I don't have anything over here.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.435
So what I'm gonna do is I'm going to create

00:00:34.435 --> 00:00:38.455
a new religious application using the NP X command.

00:00:38.455 --> 00:00:42.810
And the way you do is you type your NP x space,

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:46.685
and then the command called Create React app,

00:00:46.685 --> 00:00:50.165
followed by the name of the application you want to create.

00:00:50.165 --> 00:00:53.555
Let's say the name of the application that I want to create is called as

00:00:53.555 --> 00:00:57.035
a React demo and then press Enter.

00:00:57.035 --> 00:00:59.495
This is going to create a bunch of source code

00:00:59.495 --> 00:01:04.085
package.json is going to download the respective dependencies.

00:01:04.085 --> 00:01:07.190
As you can see, it's installing a dependency called React,

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.815
React DOM and React scripts.

00:01:09.815 --> 00:01:14.555
Now, if you compare this with other frameworks like Angular,

00:01:14.555 --> 00:01:17.585
which has got a huge list of dependencies.

00:01:17.585 --> 00:01:22.370
This is much lightweight and one of the reason for that happens to be that justice only

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:27.740
the view part of MVC and the installation may take a while.

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.875
So I'm going to pause the video and once the installation is complete,

00:01:30.875 --> 00:01:32.930
I'm going to continue the same.

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.940
All right. It took almost a minute for me to get this done.

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:39.080
And as you can see,

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.540
it says that it is finally successful.

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.875
But if you see there were lots of errors, but don't worry about that.

00:01:45.875 --> 00:01:49.789
That's because it's trying to install it using different extensions.

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:54.725
But somehow finally it figured out to install the required packages.

00:01:54.725 --> 00:01:56.780
Now, the next set of commands,

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.460
they are given very simple commands.

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.520
It says that get inside your directory and then give

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.835
these commands npm start for starting a development server.

00:02:04.835 --> 00:02:06.320
If you want to create a production build,

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.695
you'll have your npm run build or run the test cases.

00:02:09.695 --> 00:02:12.395
If you have, you can say npm test,

00:02:12.395 --> 00:02:18.309
npm run Egypt basically converts that into a single HTML JavaScript application.

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:21.590
Removing the reactor is dependencies.

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.250
At this point in time. Let's not worry about any of them.

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.525
We just want to clear the screen and note that I was on desktop.

00:02:29.525 --> 00:02:31.175
I'm still on desktop.

00:02:31.175 --> 00:02:33.605
But if I see now ls minus l,

00:02:33.605 --> 00:02:36.575
I have a new folder called reacted demo.

00:02:36.575 --> 00:02:39.545
So I'm going to cd into React demo.

00:02:39.545 --> 00:02:42.035
And if I see ls minus l over here,

00:02:42.035 --> 00:02:43.550
there are a bunch of files.

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:48.695
Node modules is where we have all the dependencies that we just got installed.

00:02:48.695 --> 00:02:50.375
It's a huge directory.

00:02:50.375 --> 00:02:51.620
Don't worry, this is going to be

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.385
only a development folder when we cleared our production build,

00:02:55.385 --> 00:02:56.600
none of these matters,

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.570
so we are going to have a smaller footprint anyways.

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:02.690
Now, every dependency that you have right now,

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.460
as well as that the one that you're going to have in

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:07.220
the future will be listed in the package.json.

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.390
So that's important.

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:09.830
Do not delete this file.

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:15.350
A public folder contains a bunch of files like basic index.html,

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.500
some fav icons and stuff like that, and that is required.

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:19.925
So don't delete that.

00:03:19.925 --> 00:03:24.335
The bulk of the code that we're gonna work with is going to be in SRC.

00:03:24.335 --> 00:03:29.855
So to see whether our application has successfully been created or not,

00:03:29.855 --> 00:03:32.510
let's just say npm start.

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.010
That's all what we have to do.

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:39.545
And what this is going to do is whatever the source code and public folder contains,

00:03:39.545 --> 00:03:41.720
it's going to combine that into an application,

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.660
converts all the JSX code,

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.740
which is a template that has come up automatically into

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:54.830
a runnable HTML JavaScript code and deploys it on the development server.

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:58.220
And then that will be opened in a browser automatically.

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:01.775
So all of these things happen behind the scene just by typing npm start.

00:04:01.775 --> 00:04:04.055
So I'm going to press enter over here.

00:04:04.055 --> 00:04:07.250
And it says that starting development server,

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.610
and you can see that it came up on localhost 3000.

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:13.400
The first two load might be a little bit time taking,

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.820
but after that you will see that everything runs very smoothly.

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.340
Now, if you are able to see this particular screen,

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:21.965
that means your application is ready.

00:04:21.965 --> 00:04:27.080
It says here edit SRC slash app.js and saved to reload.

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.665
That's all it says. Let's go and see if we can edit this

00:04:30.665 --> 00:04:34.580
SRC app.js and will that be reflected over here?

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.560
So let's go to Visual Studio Code.

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.195
And Visual Studio Code,

00:04:38.195 --> 00:04:40.970
I have a button called Open Folder.

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:44.030
If you're not seeing that, That's probably because it was collapsed.

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:48.050
Click on this icon and you have an open folder.

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:49.655
Click on the Open Folder.

00:04:49.655 --> 00:04:54.980
And let's choose our desktop and then react demo and say Open.

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:59.000
And this is the content of our application folder.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.900
So under SRC we have a file called app.js.

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:06.110
And that's exactly what actually it asks me to edit.

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:08.450
So I have a bunch of code over here.

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:11.795
I'm just going to get it off everything inside this.

00:05:11.795 --> 00:05:14.765
And I'm going to simply type your say hitch one.

00:05:14.765 --> 00:05:17.255
And then I'll say Hello, React.

00:05:17.255 --> 00:05:21.200
I have enabled autosave on my Visual Studio Code.

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:26.000
This ensures that every piece of code that I'm typing is automatically saved.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.375
Sometimes we forget to save this and then it's not reflected.

00:05:29.375 --> 00:05:34.355
But it also recompiles all our JavaScript XML code.

00:05:34.355 --> 00:05:37.745
And then redeploy is every time I'm making some changes,

00:05:37.745 --> 00:05:39.410
if you want to avoid that,

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:42.710
you untick this and then save it manually.

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:45.335
So now that I've removed this, every time,

00:05:45.335 --> 00:05:47.000
I make some changes, for example,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.850
I'm going to remove this line by pressing Control X.

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:53.974
And now I have to save this manually and then go back to the browser.

00:05:53.974 --> 00:05:56.870
And you can see it simply says, Hello React.

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:02.840
So that's it for this lecture where we saw how to create a new React js application.

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:04.445
In the next lecture,

00:06:04.445 --> 00:06:08.309
Let's clean up and refactor or application.
