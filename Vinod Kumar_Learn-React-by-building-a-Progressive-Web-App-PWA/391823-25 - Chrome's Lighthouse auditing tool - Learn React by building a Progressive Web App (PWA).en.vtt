00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.200
Welcome back in this lecture.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.380
Let's have a look in tow.

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:11.730
A tool provided by Google Chrome called Lighthouse.

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.560
This is an auditing tool.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.280
So here is my application running on Google Firebase,

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:23.790
the React Jest dash movie Dutch browser dockside with Abdul Khan that this is on a public

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.430
domain now on it is working fine.

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.600
So if I goto search for some movie,

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.950
let's Atar press enter and then take on one of the movie.

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.060
I should be able to see the loading Giff.

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.500
And then I have this details off the movie,

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.330
so the application is working just fine.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:44.000
So what we want to do is we want Toe Goto view and then say developer,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.600
we can go to developer tools.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.320
Here are any off the other stuff like Charla skipped console,

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:49.790
etcetera.

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.310
So I'm gonna go to the developer tools on one of the tool here,

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:54.030
you can see,

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.640
is the audit stool.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.000
Over here there is a generated report option.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.370
It did identify and fix common problems that affect your sights,

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.120
performance,

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.040
accessibility and user experience.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.350
So this is a fantastic tool that we can use for evaluating our application.

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.170
So what can we evaluate our application for so here with a bunch of categories you can see

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.240
performance progressive about.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.730
That's what we are more interested in best practices.

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:22.160
Have you followed or not?

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.290
Accessibility?

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:24.210
Andi s.

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.100
You are searching an optimization.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.790
We can test our applications performance against either a mobile device our desktop device

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:31.790
,

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.760
Onda 90% of the time.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.090
If it works better on mobile device,

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.060
it would definitely work better on desktops as well.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.770
So let's keep all these checked and click on the agenda.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.560
Report here and see what happens.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.570
This is going toe now Take a couple off minutes.

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:50.150
Onda.

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:56.190
Here is the rating off the application that we just know belt governments 95 is the rating

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:01.100
and it is here 9200 is the best performing applications accessibility.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:07.610
It says you're 80 and the rating is unless primary because we have used their form without

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:08.180
a label.

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:09.800
And that's the reason why we got it.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:10.940
So we can fix that.

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:11.980
Not a problem.

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.590
Look at that Best practices 100 out of 100 on S e.

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.450
We also changing optimization 100 out of 100.

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:20.580
However,

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.600
my application currently is not a progressive application at all.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.160
Our Progressive Web application it out.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.870
So performance 95 is good.

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:34.070
Let's crawl toe the accessibility part and you can see that the accessibility it's giving

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:38.040
here form element do not have associated labels.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.790
That's what it says in our new why we don't want the label here.

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.580
Labels would be given prior to our before the text boxes here.

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:46.160
Onda.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.880
We didn't want that because that doesn't look nice in our application.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.340
But just to make sure that this label is found,

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.320
you can always go to your header component.

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.850
Where there is a form and input,

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:03.550
you can surround the input with the label without actually giving any text for that.

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:04.430
In any case,

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.330
let's keep the accessibility part Andi scrawled on toe the Peaceably.

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.590
Or you can directly click on The Pwr icon over there.

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:13.660
But let's see,

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:14.210
What is this?

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:15.320
Probably all aboard.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:21.640
Some of the thing that was not taken care off his current page does not respond with 200

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.980
went offline will discuss it with that in a minute start the order does not respond with

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.090
200 offline,

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.450
so more or less related,

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:34.610
you can also see it says that it uses https but does not register something called Saris

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:37.860
worker that controls the page and start you are.

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.810
So we have to discuss about this as well.

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.380
So if we take it off this,

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.050
our application becomes a progressive rub up as well.

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:46.450
So at this point in time,

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.850
I noticed that our application is not repeatedly at all.

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:52.980
So this is a bit about the lighthouse,

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.440
which is a auditing tool provided by Google.

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:57.490
It's really very nice,

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:01.320
and it follows us to evaluate our application so we will fix both off.

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:05.960
This will fix the accessibly depart as well as the progressive application part,

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:08.050
also in the subsequent lectures.
