00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.050
welcome back in this lecture.

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:11.250
Let's create another component called movie details component,

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.350
which is supposed to give me the details off any movie that I chose to click on.

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:16.750
Obviously,

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:17.960
there's an old couple of things.

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:18.660
Number one.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.040
When I click on this,

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.130
I have to change the part.

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:23.770
We know how that works.

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:27.860
So we just had to provide a link and then say two equals two,

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:33.520
Whatever the part corresponding to that on the second thing is we have to fetch the details

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:39.770
off the movie using the IMDb i d So are searching remains the same thing Except the

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:41.700
perimeters would be changing.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.480
For example,

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:49.270
you can see that we are having here s equals toe Iron Man gives me an array off all the

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.200
movies that correspond to the title.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:56.830
But if I give I equals two and then this supply this particular I am d v i t.

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:58.530
Then we will get a different outputs.

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.220
I'm gonna type your I equals toe and IMDb idea presenter.

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:07.150
You'll see that we are supposed to get a single object this time consisting off the

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.250
writings of details off this particular movie that includes,

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.940
for example,

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.200
title year.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.810
What is the rated?

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:14.720
Released?

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.660
What is the total duration?

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:17.420
Right?

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:24.020
So lots and lots of details that we can explore so toe create the same thing that's

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:30.790
possible to our Via scored and create a new component under the Components folder someone

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:31.120
appeared.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:37.530
A new file Over here I will call this US movie details dot jsx.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:44.130
I relate I am RC and then get the corresponding import statements and then really great a

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.030
state full component over here by typing CCS and then press enter.

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.250
And we got the movie details,

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:57.750
which extends component that a class on the state here is going to represent a single movie

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:58.350
object.

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.990
So I'll type your movie.

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.540
Andi,

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.600
its value is going to be a curly bracket.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.370
This represents an empty object and we want to render some JSX.

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:08.170
So for the timing,

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.820
I'm just going to type your on empty do nothing else When the component is loaded.

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.110
I want to get the details off the movie which is supplied.

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.350
Why are the quietest ing perimeter which is nothing but the IMDb idea that we're gonna use

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.350
?

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:30.310
So if I go back to the movie list component this part remains the same upto here except

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.320
that we want to send I equals two and I am db idea over here.

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:36.330
That's one change.

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.490
The second change is one of the data that I get it a single movie.

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:42.650
So I wanna design that Tow the state.

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.570
So we want to make some changes over there as well.

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:52.150
So I'm gonna copy this functions come back Toe movie Little's based All here on the first

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.880
changes nothing.

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:59.040
But this is I equals toe the imdb i d assuming that the quietest ing perimeter is also

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.480
called us,

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:00.470
I am db i d.

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:06.850
So I'm gonna type your imdb I d on this is supposed to be supplied from our click event

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:07.230
handler.

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:13.000
So that is whenever I click on a particular movie this I am DB idea I'll be supplying.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.950
So I have toe right the link over here So we'll do that in a minute.

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.530
The second thing is that whenever I got the data,

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.840
that's call it as movie insert off movies because I got a single movie object on.

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:30.360
The same thing is going to be applied toe the state also so the current state will move in

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:35.250
an empty object will now be replaced with the data that is coming from the Internet.

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.650
So now that we have the movie object over here,

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:44.780
we can try printing the same thing on the do over here if you want just to test it out,

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.080
for example,

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.380
like in just use the caliber record and then I can take your Jason dot string.

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.160
If I off this dot state dot movie on,

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:59.290
that's going to just show me what is the string washing off the entire Jason object.

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:00.720
Let's give it a try.

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.010
The second thing that we have to do is to go to the Abdullah Chase,

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:06.560
and then we have to say here that he,

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.230
whenever there is a part called something like details are movie details.

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.750
We want to send a different component are we want toe render a different component.

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:21.380
So I'm gonna just duplicate this by typing shift option Down Arrow,

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.420
our shift all down arrow for windows and that's a copy day on.

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:30.350
Let's give a new partier called details since we are working with the movie,

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:35.590
So where I don't have to say that it's a movie details so details on the component is

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:38.750
nothing but the movie details component.

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.230
So save this.

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:45.250
Now we have a part on one last thing that we have to do usedto go to the movie list.

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:46.340
Dajae six.

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.370
Where a movie list is nothing,

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:52.500
Will and Ari on that are a represents one movie card,

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.760
so we don't have to go to the movie Carded RJ six.

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:56.300
Right,

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.110
a click event handler for this day,

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.570
such that when you click on the Do a function is in walked on.

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:10.900
The way you can do is you can say that on Click equals two on expression and generally on

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.530
Click equals Toby Assign,

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:16.930
a function name on the function will be automatically called by the objects.

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:20.680
But this time we want to in work a function because we want to supplier.

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.300
I am DB idea off this movie.

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:23.170
So first,

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:24.850
let's write a function over here.

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:28.010
And since we are writing a function based component,

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:29.820
we can declare a variable here.

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:30.150
Say,

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:31.050
for example,

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:37.790
get movie details equals toe an adult function that takes an imdb i.

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:38.130
D.

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:43.470
Onda probably does some work over here,

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:45.260
so we'll come back to that in a minute,

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:49.860
not that is a variable are a local variable off this particular function,

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:53.980
which is nothing but another function so we can assign that over here.

00:05:53.980 --> 00:06:00.720
But if I design than on Click Reactors will in work it by passing an event object on,

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.270
we wanted an IMDb 80.

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:08.740
So that is why what we do is we write an adult function here and then say Get movie details

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:11.070
off movie dot i am db i d.

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:11.360
So,

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:12.040
in other words,

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:15.900
Vienna following the ECJ esto in work our function,

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:21.700
we are asking in readjusting work dysfunction and when readjust in north dysfunction,

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:23.640
we get the event object here,

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:25.880
which is not important for me right now.

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:27.550
That's why I'm not receiving the different.

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:30.220
But then I'm in working the function,

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:31.700
get movie details on.

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:34.560
I'm passing the IMDb idea off the current movie,

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.070
which is what is received over here.

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:39.030
And in the previous example,

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:45.060
we actually called history not pushed over here by saying a new part.

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:46.200
Similarly,

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:48.240
we have to do the same thing over here.

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:50.660
But if you look at the head of J six,

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:57.720
we said history is part off this dark prompts and this is a valued only inside a class

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:58.550
based component.

00:06:58.550 --> 00:06:59.010
But,

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:01.450
as our movie called is a function based component,

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:03.100
so we can't really do that over there.

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:08.110
But what we can do is we can actually ask for this wit rotor,

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:11.290
higher order component from react rotor.

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:13.400
Don on then,

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:19.070
say that I want toe contoured this movie called Component in tow a component that has all

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:20.030
the rotor information.

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:21.630
So we're gonna say you're with the rotor.

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:27.130
So now this component is having access toe the history object also,

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:32.140
but always come as additional property so we can simply type your along with the movie

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:33.790
which is coming from the parent company.

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:36.690
Writ rotor would have added something called history.

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:42.610
And now we got the history over here and I simply have to type history dot Push on.

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:43.560
Where do I have to go?

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:45.750
I have to go toe slash details.

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:46.990
Question Mark.

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:53.310
I am db i d equals two plus the argument that I received over here.

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:55.680
I see a small error over here.

00:07:55.680 --> 00:08:00.510
I believe that's because I missed an ad over here and everything is fine.

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:01.590
Let's save this.

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:05.240
Let's go back and check it for application is working as expected.

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:09.130
Now I'm getting a couple of errors called Quite a string is undefined.

00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:11.050
Axios is undefined in the movie.

00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:12.340
Details start J six.

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:17.870
And that's primarily because I copied and pasted these functions from another component.

00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:20.880
So where we have got these two,

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:22.630
So let's copy this on,

00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:24.120
then paste over here.

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:26.050
So now that problem is sold.

00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:31.690
So one final thing that we have to do is to display the details of the movie in the renders

00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:32.570
written function.

00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:34.460
So that's what we're gonna do now.

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:39.560
So first thing I'm gonna do is tow extract the movie from state.

00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:44.270
So they here let movie equals toe the start state.

00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:48.750
So I don't have to say this dot state dot movie dot Every time I want access.

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:50.520
Some didn't another.

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:51.100
I got it.

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:54.320
Let's organize our return statement properly,

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:55.820
so I'm gonna change this.

00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:57.780
I'm gonna have to sections over here.

00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:01.310
The the 1st 4 on the left side is the image of the movie,

00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:02.110
which is the movie.

00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:07.110
That poster on the second part is going to be a table that displays all the details off the

00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:07.530
movie.

00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:08.870
So let's go,

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:17.620
right it I'm gonna type your dot ro greater than dot call dash MD Dash four And that's for

00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:25.960
the poster plus dot call Dash MD Dash eight And that's going to be another child column.

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:27.070
So I'm gonna press enter.

00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:34.870
So we got to columns over here on the first column is going to just contain a I am G I AMG

00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:36.590
AMG Dash Company.

00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:41.990
And then the source for that happens to be an expression,

00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:46.530
which is nothing but a movie dot poster Onda.

00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:55.250
Then we have all equals toe movie dot titan on inside the second column,

00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:56.650
which is on the right side,

00:09:56.650 --> 00:10:02.800
I'm gonna have your a hitch one which consists off movie DOT title.

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:06.840
So let's see if this is gonna work properly.

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:07.280
Andi.

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:08.660
If that comes up properly,

00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:11.150
let's display the rest of the details also.

00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:13.520
So let's go back to the browser.

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:16.340
Let's click on one other movie over here on.

00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:18.350
I should get the details,

00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:19.550
the movie over here.

00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:24.050
But I got another thing that cannot read Property poster off Undefined.

00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:25.000
Now,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.890
one of the reason is we copied and pasted this trade from the movie list.

00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:31.400
Andi know that whenever we got the restaurants,

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:32.970
we got the rest of your data.

00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:33.590
That is fine.

00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:36.170
But the data doesn't have such object.

00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:38.360
It has the movie directly.

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:40.150
So I'm gonna remove this line,

00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:42.010
and I think the problem is solved.

00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:43.940
So let's save this.

00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:45.110
Go back to the browser.

00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:45.920
An urgency.

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:48.480
We got the Spider Man and Spider Man two.

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:50.190
So I'm gonna go back.

00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:55.670
Let's click on one of the other movies so you can see that we got the movie poster on the

00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:57.980
name off the movie over here.

00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:01.280
So let's go back to our court,

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:04.980
display the remaining details for this movie.

00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:07.990
So for displaying the remaining details of the movie,

00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:15.540
I'm just going toe type your table Dark table on day is going to give you a table with a

00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:16.790
class name off table.

00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:18.550
That's the bootstrapped last name,

00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:26.270
which is gonna have a Peabody and that's gonna have one role with two columns in it so I

00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:27.870
can say her TV into two.

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:28.740
But if I want,

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:28.940
say,

00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:30.370
around the 10 columns,

00:11:30.370 --> 00:11:33.730
so I'm gonna just multiply this by 10 Andi,

00:11:33.730 --> 00:11:40.190
that TV is gonna be multiplied by two because I want for every row two columns safe a press

00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:46.140
enter you're gonna get a big table with a T body on the tendrils where every now has two

00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:46.900
columns in it.

00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:53.790
So the 1st 1 I want to display is the director on The value for that happens to be movie

00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:54.810
dot director.

00:11:54.810 --> 00:11:56.260
The next one,

00:11:56.260 --> 00:12:01.880
probably is the plot off the movie so I can see your movie dot plot.

00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:05.970
Then we have the year movie dot year on.

00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:06.680
Similarly,

00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:10.540
I have to give the rest of the details which I will pause on.

00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:11.950
Come back in a minute.

00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:14.300
All right?

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:16.850
I have given a few other details also.

00:12:16.850 --> 00:12:21.290
Now let's go back to our application over here on Beacon.

00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:21.610
See,

00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:24.670
I got more details on the movie also,

00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:26.630
so I'm gonna look for something else.

00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:26.790
Now,

00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:27.730
let's a car.

00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:29.840
I got lots of movie than cardinals.

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:34.580
I'm gonna click on the 1st 1 when I click on the 1st 1 You should get the details off the

00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:35.790
1st 1 again.

00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:37.330
Let's see that in the full screen.

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:41.790
More so I'm gonna go back toe movie browser and let's look at,

00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:42.250
say,

00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:44.200
island man on press enter.

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:45.770
We got some of those on.

00:12:45.770 --> 00:12:49.570
I'm going to select something that not a regular iron man over here.

00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:52.400
When I click on this because the details off the same,

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:57.010
we can also give a button over here are somewhere at the bottom,

00:12:57.010 --> 00:12:58.340
where when I click on that,

00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:00.750
I want toe go back to the previous one.

00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:01.350
Right now,

00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:03.570
I'm clicking the back button over here,

00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:07.030
but I can actually provide a button by myself.

00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:11.790
So that way we can do is let's go back to our core after the table.

00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:18.130
Probably I can add a button with a class name off Bt and Bt and primary,

00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:20.530
and then we'll type your back.

00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:26.470
So this is supposed to take me back toe the previous speech and for we check and type here

00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:31.350
on click equals toe a function on.

00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:35.590
I convey the function directly by typing and at a function on a lot to say.

00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:41.880
Here this start Trump started history dot Go off minus one.

00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:44.570
Now not that the entire function call.

00:13:44.570 --> 00:13:45.910
I'm doing it right here.

00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:50.050
I don't have to write another function and then passed the name over here.

00:13:50.050 --> 00:13:51.550
So for one liners,

00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:53.700
you can always do something like this.

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:56.950
So let's go save this and see if this works.

00:13:56.950 --> 00:14:00.380
So I'm gonna go back over here that the back button when I click on this back,

00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:03.780
wouldn't you can see I'm taken back to the previous speech.

00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:05.600
I click on one of the other movie.

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:07.040
I still have this details.

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:08.190
I click on the back button.

00:14:08.190 --> 00:14:10.330
It takes me back to the previous speech.

00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:10.960
Once again,

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:15.480
it's one thing to notice Here is that whenever I click on a particular movie,

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:18.180
it will go blank here for some time.

00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:18.920
And then actually,

00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:19.960
the data comes on.

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:25.310
This is primarily because I m d B a p a is the one that is taking a bit off time on.

00:14:25.310 --> 00:14:26.890
What we would like to do is,

00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:29.460
whenever we click on this,

00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:32.380
the movie details component is being loaded.

00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:33.780
At that point in time,

00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:38.430
we want to check if this particular object here the movie object.

00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:41.900
Is it an empty object like its initial state?

00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:49.040
Or has it been populated with some data from imdb ap dot com and then conditionally render

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:51.090
this particular JSX?

00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:52.760
So to do that,

00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:55.340
let's would a reef condition over here,

00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:59.560
and we will also declare one variable called output equals toe,

00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:01.440
probably a deal,

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:05.870
slash do where I can say something like loading.

00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:11.970
But if movie is an object with one or more properties,

00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:13.170
that means it has been loaded.

00:15:13.170 --> 00:15:16.270
Nor does the initial state has an empty object.

00:15:16.270 --> 00:15:17.550
There is no properties in that.

00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:21.650
So that becomes our criteria toe check if it's loaded or not.

00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:30.740
So we read any of condition here says that if a movie is defined as the less the number off

00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:36.150
keys in the movie object is greater than zero.

00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:40.190
So initially it is it also obviously this will not satisfy,

00:15:40.190 --> 00:15:44.850
so obviously it's going toe remain as do loading.

00:15:44.850 --> 00:15:51.670
But if this condition is satisfied that all I have to do is tow take this entire deal from

00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:52.150
here.

00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:53.960
Still this part.

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:59.570
So I'm gonna cut this from here and then assigned this toe the variable all put like this.

00:15:59.570 --> 00:16:02.570
And once we have assigned that,

00:16:02.570 --> 00:16:08.260
now I can return all put as part off the render function over here.

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:13.490
So this is how we can render JSX conditionally on.

00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:14.810
Let's see if this is gonna work.

00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:18.600
So I'm gonna say this on then go back to the browser.

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:20.610
It has been reloaded.

00:16:20.610 --> 00:16:25.140
Let's click on a movie that we haven't loaded yet because if it was loaded once,

00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:26.180
it would have been cashed.

00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:28.660
Let's let's click on this last one.

00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:30.120
So when I click on this,

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:34.780
you'll see that it is loading and then the actual content comes up here.

00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:37.400
So Internet having a text loading.

00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:41.010
We can also have an animated GIF you can search on.

00:16:41.010 --> 00:16:46.830
Get a animated GIF files from lots of free websites.

00:16:46.830 --> 00:16:48.320
So I do have one.

00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:52.450
I am going to copy that on toe my public images folder.

00:16:52.450 --> 00:16:53.030
Right now,

00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:55.590
it has only we know Dodge epic.

00:16:55.590 --> 00:17:00.350
I want a copy and Paste one other file that I have called loading dot Jeff.

00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:05.270
So I do have this loading that gift,

00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:09.090
which simply just gives their progress off your application.

00:17:09.090 --> 00:17:09.350
Of course,

00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:10.070
there's a jet file.

00:17:10.070 --> 00:17:12.760
It's going to go into a loop to display the same thing.

00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:15.910
So let's go back to our output here.

00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:18.570
So the output has div loading.

00:17:18.570 --> 00:17:23.860
So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna put your do class name equals toe.

00:17:23.860 --> 00:17:25.270
Let's a texture center,

00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:29.730
so indicating that everything has to be in the middle as well as into of loading.

00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:31.550
I'm gonna add a attack.

00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:41.240
Here I am G SRC equals toe slash images slash loading dot Jif or GIF on the ultimate text

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:41.740
would be,

00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:42.180
say,

00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:45.400
loading and save this Onda.

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:45.590
Now,

00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:47.100
if I go back to the browser,

00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:48.850
you can see that the image came up.

00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:52.120
Let's click on a back button here to see a different movie.

00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:54.300
Let's search for a different movie altogether.

00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:59.350
Let's say Avengers on Presenter on I Got You In Just Movie.

00:17:59.350 --> 00:18:01.640
I'm gonna kick on one of The Avengers movie over here,

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:02.740
So when I click on that,

00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:05.120
you can see initially chose a loading icon,

00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:06.460
our image.

00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:08.700
And then there is a content over here.

00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:13.450
So this is how you can render JSX conditionally.

00:18:13.450 --> 00:18:15.310
So that's it for this lecture.

00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:16.530
In the next lecture,

00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:19.980
let's see how to create a production build off or application
