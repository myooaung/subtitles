00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.980
Welcome back in this lecture.

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.750
Let's see how apparent component can pass the values to child component.

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:13.070
For example,

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:15.490
we have the movie list component as the parent,

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.380
which is making use off movie called as the child component.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:27.120
And we want to pass a movie object from the movie list toe movie car so far that you go

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:34.080
back to our movie list on Here is where I have instance created a movie card and I have

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.450
this variable and here which has never been used.

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.220
So this is the function argument for my call back,

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.420
and I have to supply this on.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:42.420
Since we're using,

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.990
like HTML tags,

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:47.400
you can supply this M as HTML attributes.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.250
For example,

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.690
I can type your movie equals toe.

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:57.380
I didn't say your M so which means that we are just supplying the variable em as a

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:58.320
perimeter toe.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.320
This movie now this could be anything.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.540
So since the Trump presents one movie,

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:03.830
I just care it like that.

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:04.560
Nothing else.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.700
So now that we are passing here,

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.520
we should also be receiving the same in movie card and in movie card.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.200
We now can have a variable called movie,

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.870
so if you go back to the movie card.

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.100
We already have a variable car movie that is over here.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.220
I don't need this anymore,

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:22.450
so I'm gonna get off that.

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.190
But if I get up that that would be an editor here because there is no variable called movie

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.700
Now,

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.280
this is where this function perimeter comes in tow picture.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.640
Now from the movie list,

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.870
which is a parent I can pass as many attributes.

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:43.350
I want you All the attributes that I passed from here will be received here as one single

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.380
object typically named us Props props because it's like properties.

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.570
But that's the general convention that reactors follows its got props,

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.460
and now I can say here Prop,

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.180
start with a title prop,

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.150
start moving out here prop start moving title again.

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.240
Props that movie that poster here.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:08.040
But in order to a wide the use off props dot everywhere what I can do is I can say you're

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:11.950
let movie equals toe crops.

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:19.960
Now this is an year six object de structuring mechanism where the object props has a

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:25.930
property are variable called movie Inside that were clearing a new local variable called

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:26.480
Movie,

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.890
and that movie is going to be used everywhere here.

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.520
So this object de structuring,

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:38.630
let's go save this movie card and then moving list and then come back to our application.

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:45.600
Now you should see that all the movies are different here now because it supplied and for

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.450
every movie supplied its displaying the respective details over here.

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.520
One more thing that we can do in the movie card here is we're doing an object restructuring

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:55.350
over here.

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:56.730
Instead,

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.950
we can do that object restructuring over here itself.

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.420
All you have to do is to copy this on,

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.280
then replace this over here so we don't need this line anymore.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.570
So in other words,

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:12.650
whatever the object that is coming as a perimeter from their object,

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.250
we are only interested in the movie attribute.

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.570
So if I save this go back,

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.930
I should still see the same result.

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:21.980
No change.

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:28.210
One more thing that you also should see is by going to the developer console so you can go

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:30.960
toe view developer.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.530
They're the developer.

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.920
Tools are JavaScript console.

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:35.910
Let's go to the console.

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:36.340
Here.

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.370
You can see we get an editor.

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:45.840
It says that each child in a list should have a unique key prop on that is coming because

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.950
in the movie listed or J six line number eight.

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:54.910
So if I go back over there movie list J six like Number eight here is a map that we're

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:55.350
doing.

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:58.110
So the map actually trained tooken World,

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:01.030
a single movie object into a movie car.

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.830
So eventually it's going to give you a collection off movies.

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:10.640
So it says that the collection off J six must have a unique ID called Key.

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:16.070
So we need to define a property called Key Equals Toe and some unique number.

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:19.200
Now I can give any number I have uniquely,

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:19.980
for example,

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.560
while the map gives you not only the movie object,

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.300
it also gives the index we didn't collect that if I wanted,

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.090
I could have put a bracket here and put,

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.550
um,

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:29.610
comma index,

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:30.770
and then I can supply.

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.910
But since I know that the movie object has a unique idea call,

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:34.860
I am debility.

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:39.580
I can just use the same thing so I can take your m dot i am db i d.

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.640
And that's the property that we have there.

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:42.790
I save it.

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:46.230
Come back to the browser you concede that our other is gone.

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:51.730
One more thing that you can see is that it says that s t is assigned a value but never used

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:54.010
home is defined but never use.

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:55.780
Movie card is different but never used.

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:57.840
These are some of the unused variables.

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.090
Let's clean up that also.

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:03.170
So in here movie card We had this variable S t.

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:04.130
We don't need this.

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:07.620
I'm going to get it off that Save it in the ad.

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:08.270
Georges,

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.880
we have the home and movie called.

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:11.930
We don't need this,

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:13.090
at least for the time being.

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:14.450
Later we're gonna add that.

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:17.190
So I'm gonna remove it from their save it.

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:18.730
Come back to the browser.

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:20.970
You can see the warnings have gone.

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:22.600
So that's it for this lecture.

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:23.920
In the next lecture,

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:30.650
let's get the actual movie details from the IMDb FBI instead off hard coded values using

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:31.350
objects
