00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.030
Welcome back in this lecture.

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:11.210
Let's see the softer side of required for getting started with the edges.

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:13.470
Number one is nor Jace now.

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:19.250
Nor Jace provides a platform where we can compile our JavaScript XML chord in tow,

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.010
something that the browser understands.

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:22.060
Like the child basket.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:28.150
We also would like to have a development Web server which is actually written in no Js are

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.910
you can say job basket to process all these things we need.

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.580
Norges know that this is only a development requirement.

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:38.260
That means one year application is built on the ready to be deployed.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:43.350
You can deploy it on any server and has no dependency on Norges at all.

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.800
The current washing is $13.11 dollars zero at this point in time.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:53.310
But what we would like to do is to use the latest long term support installation.

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:59.530
So So we're gonna download this 12 or $16.1 LTs I'm gonna click on that depending on the

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.540
operating system that you have it appropriately downloads a 11 software.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:04.700
So,

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:05.450
in my case,

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:07.460
because I'm using Mac toys,

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:08.900
I'm getting a package fight.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.920
I'm keeping it in my downloads.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:17.290
Save it once the download is already let's click on that toe open.

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.050
So this is a simple wizard.

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:26.800
Just go ahead and take on the continue button over here except the license agreement on.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.710
Then choose the location.

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.390
I would like to install this in the default location I click on install.

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:38.380
Asking the root privileges Are the administration probably just I'm gonna enter my password

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:39.780
and that's it.

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.290
So click on close to come out off this and it says that Do you want the installation file

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.900
that was downloaded from the Net because we finished the installation?

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:49.540
We don't need that.

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.060
I can remove that on delete the same.

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.220
Now let's open a terminal toe,

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:56.680
see the same thing on windows,

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.190
you open a command front and then check for the washing off.

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.960
Nor Jace.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.770
I'm gonna take your node dash.

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.620
We are dash dash Russian,

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:10.280
and it's going to say 12 16 1 which is the one that we don't want it and installed.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.810
Notice also comes with two more utilities.

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.760
One off them is called NPM,

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.670
which is the North Package manager on that.

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.620
This is used for installing the project dependencies.

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:23.220
For example,

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.950
if you're the obvious project depends on some third party libraries like Jake Worry are

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:29.950
Axios,

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.690
so we might want to install them.

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.950
And this is what actually comes store help.

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.680
So NPM dash V or destined abortion shows.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.470
What's the wash in?

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.160
I believe the six star 13.4 is not the latest ocean.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:48.700
So what we can do is we can upgrade the washing off No package manager using NPM itself.

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:49.150
So what?

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.610
We can do it.

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:55.040
We can type your pseudo and pseudo is required only on Mac and Lean X platforms,

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.060
not on Windows on Windows.

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:03.060
Simply typed the command NPM Dash G update and then type NPM itself.

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.280
So we're using NPM Toe Update.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.340
A package called NPM on Dad's G is for Global On.

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.670
That's the reason why we need this pseudo on Mac and Linux.

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:14.270
So I pressed.

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.650
Enter.

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.310
It's gonna ask my password,

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.130
and it's going to download the latest version off NPM,

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:20.510
an update on my system.

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.340
And now if I say here npm dash,

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:30.750
we we should see six start $14 to Norges also comes with another executable col N B X.

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:38.100
On this is used for running executable without having to install in the only Russians off

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.370
react.

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.700
Jess.

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.340
We used to use a command line tool called Create React at,

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.200
and that has been duplicated,

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.540
and you have to run it using this MPX command,

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.480
which will see in the next lecture.

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.580
But just to have a look at what's the washing?

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:51.880
We have your MP ext,

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:52.480
actually,

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.400
on its six start $14 to,

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.240
and that's what the Norges installation on verification.

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.530
Let's exit out off this on.

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.220
The second softer that we required to use is the little,

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.220
and there are many editors that are available officially,

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:09.140
even Facebook,

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:12.730
also say is that they're developers used this particular softer,

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:13.210
which is,

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.890
by the way,

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:14.540
three.

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:15.520
From Microsoft.

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.980
It's based off another open source software called Atom.

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:21.280
Based on your operating system.

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.690
There's already a download button for use in case if you have chosen something wrong,

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:27.640
you can go and choose a different one.

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:33.150
So all you have to do is to click on the download for your operating system,

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:38.330
and that's gonna don't be a score Darwin stable for me on.

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:43.750
I chose in the downloads location it zip archives so I can keep it wherever I want Let's it

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:43.750
,

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:44.310
for example.

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:45.750
I'm gonna keep it on my desktop.

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:47.250
I save.

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:48.890
And once it's done,

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:57.520
I'm gonna open the seam so you can see that I got an executable directly here on Windows.

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.960
It might be a different set of fights,

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.850
but you will get the e x er executable.

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:05.150
I'll have to lose to double click the same thing.

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:06.580
Typically,

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:10.240
we would like to keep this in our applications folder on Mac.

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.220
So I'm gonna just to drag this on,

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:16.780
drop it on toe my applications and then I'm gonna release that.

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:18.450
Since I already have this,

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:19.610
it's going to ask me,

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:20.810
Do you want to keep both of them?

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:22.250
Are Are you want to stop?

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:27.040
The copying are due on replay that would lead to replace that with the latest fashion.

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:28.160
At this point in time,

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.400
one thing I want to mention is that softer were scored.

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.720
Here is one of those after Mitchell called ever being softer s.

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.280
Which means once you install this,

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:41.100
you don't have toe worry about downloading and installing the latest question again because

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:44.160
every time you have an Internet connection on your opening,

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:51.210
the were scored automatically checks food up didn't and installs the latest updates so that

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:55.970
being set up now we are good to go with developing off a reactive application.

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:57.460
So in the next lecture,

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:00.490
let's create a brand new react application.
