00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.070
Welcome back in this lecture.

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:13.700
Let's see how to install the Google fire based tools are it's also called a firebase,

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:14.170
Eli.

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:16.860
So I'm back in my command front.

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.180
It doesn't matter which directly I'm right now in.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.590
Although I'm in my project directory,

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.460
it doesn't matter because the commander we're gonna give is a global installation I have to

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.980
do here.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.850
NPM I are in Stone Dash G for Global.

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.790
This is why the current folder doesn't matter.

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:42.870
And then I simply had to type here Fire based tools on Windows You just started Press enter

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.820
on Mac os and Lennox.

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.550
I have to perfect this command with pseudo so I can run it as an administrator,

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.480
it is gonna ask me the password.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.820
I'm gonna enter my password.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.570
Press enter on.

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.040
This is gonna install firebase tools globally so I can execute the command called fire base

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.150
from any four that I want.

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:06.720
So as you can see Firebase tools $7.15 dollars.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.350
One has been successfully installed,

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.390
and now I have access to a command God fire base.

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.120
So I can say you're Firebase Dash Dash Washington.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.670
Andi,

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.860
I should see the theme washing once again You can also say Firebase Dash,

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.040
Dash help on.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.590
It's going to give you some help on the command fire base itself.

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:27.870
As you can see,

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:29.880
that there is a bunch off them,

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.400
one off them straight away.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.440
You should observe that there is an option called Log in and La Goat Onda.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:43.270
Now using this firebase tool what we have to do basically usedto connect toe our fire maze

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.720
a corn,

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.780
which I can ideologue didn't ask now.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:46.980
Not that I've loved him.

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.020
Tow this user currently.

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.820
To do that,

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.580
I may have to go and type here.

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.030
Five based logging when I pressed.

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.410
Enter,

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:58.170
It's gonna ask me a couple of questions.

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.540
Number one it says that Hey,

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.770
do you want fire base to collect some anonymous data so it can employs on the fire based

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:05.450
tool itself?

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.000
If I'm okay with that,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.040
I can say yes and then press enter on what it does.

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:16.560
It is going to take me to the browser on ask me toe rallied eight or verify is the

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.080
legitimate operation.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.380
So I say yes,

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:20.590
I want to use this one.

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.070
So my account Kyra tired.

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.880
Not we know that gmail dot com is the one that I want to use it in the command prompt.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.310
If you have multiple,

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.350
then you can choose a final count at one point in time.

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.740
Thus,

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.570
firebase Eli can connect toe only one account.

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:36.270
So I'm gonna select this one,

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.430
validate the same fire basis,

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.210
conforming all these information will be provided to the CIA lie.

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:43.330
Is that okay?

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:44.300
So I'd say yes.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.820
Hello.

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.140
And now it is five.

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:48.500
A cli logging its successful.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.830
You can go back to command line and then check out.

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:52.660
I see a message here as well.

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:53.570
It's a success.

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:58.530
Love dinner sky attire dot We know at gmail dot com Have you tried to log in again?

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.470

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:07.080
So a user on one more thing that we can check is the firebase list.

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:12.950
This is going to give you the list off projects that be are currently having it is that the

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.790

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.880

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:25.560
It's gonna list out all the projects that we have on the one that we created movie Broza,

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.490
which is the latest one,

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:29.150
which is react jest.

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:30.030
Movie Browser.

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.310
This is the project that we have andan The next lecture.

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:40.150
Let's see how we can initialize the fire Best project for our application so we can do a

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.850
deployment.

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:42.710
