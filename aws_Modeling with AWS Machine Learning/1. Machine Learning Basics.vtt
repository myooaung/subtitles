00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.140
[Autogenerated] Welcome to this module on Machine Learning

2
00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.840
Foundation on a doubly is built in algorithms.

3
00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:12.330
We will begin discourse by understanding how to map a business need to

4
00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.630
a mission learning problem and learned when to use mission learning as

5
00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:19.640
a strategy to solve the business problem.

6
00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.550
Then we will like deep on take a look at different machine

7
00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.940
learning algorithms provided by AWS.

8
00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.340
Then we will launch into a demo on Learn About different features

9
00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:35.140
off Amazon Sage maker on start developing a model.

10
00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.290
Then we will learn how to use different data splitting

11
00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.640
strategies to train and test the model.

12
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.340
And before we finish,

13
00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.090
we will also take a detailed look as how to find you in the hyper parameters.

14
00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.640
Using Amazon Sage maker.

15
00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.440
Let's quickly look the different faces off machine learning lifecycle.

16
00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.680
Developing a model starts with identifying a business problem on mapping

17
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.440
the right machine learning strategy to solve error.

18
00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.120
Once the mission learning approaches, finalize.

19
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:13.740
We need to collect the data that will help us in the training and testing face.

20
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:14.870
Most of the time,

21
00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:20.510
the raw data that was collected cannot be used as is the data needs to be

22
00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:25.040
processed so that we can Docker meaningful information from it.

23
00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.680
Once the data is processed,

24
00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:32.340
we can launch into Amazon sage maker on start developing the model.

25
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.670
Usually the data will be split into training data and

26
00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.740
test data in the 80 20 or 90 10 ratio.

27
00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.540
Training data is then used to train the model.

28
00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.240
This Martin can then be used against a test data to check

29
00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.440
how well its course against the new data.

30
00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.340
This is a nitrate your process to fine tune the accuracy of the morning.

31
00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.130
Once the decide accuracy is achieved,

32
00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.140
this model can then be deployed unmonitored.

33
00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.880
You can think of a model as a generalized solution to

34
00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.540
your specific business problem.

35
00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.070
After applying a mission learning algorithm to your

36
00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:20.440
training data in this course, we will talk primarily on developing the model,

37
00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:26.380
training the morning when tuning the hyper parameters of the model machine.

38
00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.440
Learning is all about data on identifying patents in them,

39
00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.030
on driving meaningful relations between them so that the model can make

40
00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.700
intelligent predictions you might have experienced when your bank

41
00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.260
temporarily puts a hold on your credit card after a transaction of a large

42
00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.340
amount RGBA New Sharpton International location.

43
00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.140
This is actually mission.

44
00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:56.240
Learning in Action, the banking model has studied your pattern of shopping.

45
00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.740
When there was a deviation from the predicted behavior,

46
00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.640
it actually issued an alert as a protective measure,

47
00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.840
which sometimes could be a false positive.

48
00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.330
But before predictions,

49
00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.870
your model need to study a lot of data so that it can learn

50
00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.740
the user behavior on create a pattern.

51
00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:19.540
This process is not just time intensive,

52
00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:25.080
but it's also resource intensive, so you need a lot of computational power,

53
00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.040
as we discussed before.

54
00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.140
Machine learning is a buzzword these days,

55
00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:36.640
and every organization would like to implement a machine learning solution.

56
00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.840
But it's machine learning the right solution for all business problems.

57
00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.340
Maybe not.

58
00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.150
Let's look at the factors that needs to be considered

59
00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.040
before using machine learning as a solution.

60
00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.340
First and foremost is data, as we discussed before,

61
00:03:53.340 --> 00:04:00.340
data on lots off it or needed in driving a reasonably predictable model.

62
00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:05.240
You also need expertise that can study and eliminate the nice around the

63
00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:09.640
OData so that you can retain meaningful information.

64
00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:16.640
This is a huge field by itself in data science calls feature engineering.

65
00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:21.140
Next one is a lack off computational power.

66
00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:25.140
You need machines that are powerful so that it can crunch the data

67
00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:29.040
that you are going to feed in developing the model.

68
00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.680
There are mission critical applications where an error in your

69
00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.340
model predictions may not be acceptable.

70
00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.520
So obviously, mission learning it's not right solution.

71
00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.640
These scenarios.

72
00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:47.710
Some of the business problems can be solved by simple rules on for these cases.

73
00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:51.840
You can write simple computer programs with powerful rule engines.

74
00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.940
He'll stop depending on machine learning.

75
00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:59.640
So before suggesting machine learning as a solution to your business problem,

76
00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:06.000
be cognizant of the fact that it is an expensive solution and you're choosing you trying.
