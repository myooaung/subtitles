00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:02,260
[Autogenerated] Let's switch our attention to

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:06,240
performance metrics for regression problems.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,750
Let's think off a simple linear regression problem off predicting the house

4
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:18,200
price based on the square feet shown here is a sample five data points on the

5
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:23,710
linear graph showing the predictions The x excess indicates the size of the

6
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:28,640
house on the Y axis indicates the price.

7
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,440
As you can see, as the size goes higher,

8
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:36,440
the prices of the house increase as well.

9
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:40,640
Once the optimal model that fits through the data is found,

10
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,400
we can predict any future prices of the House.

11
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:46,040
Given its size,

12
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:51,640
let's look at some off the commonly used metrics in regression problems.

13
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:58,740
First one is mean absolute error, also called us l one loss.

14
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:02,320
If Wi-Fi indicate the actual price of the house in the

15
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:09,740
thousands for a given square feet, white cap indicates the predicted price.

16
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:13,840
Let's do a simple math on calculate the error values for the

17
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,340
five data points that we have in the chop.

18
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:20,730
Let's assume the actual prices off.

19
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:29,940
These five data points are 100 2 20 2 75 3 50 on 500.

20
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:31,010
On their corresponding,

21
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:41,940
predicted values are 110 200 to 85 3 40 on 400 respectively.

22
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,220
Mean absolute error.

23
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:44,840
R M A.

24
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:48,200
Is the average off the some off the differences

25
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,840
between the predictor and actual prices?

26
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,940
Let's see the steps involved in calculating mean absolute error.

27
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:58,240
First,

28
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,290
calculate the residual that is a difference between the actual

29
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:06,740
under predicted value at each specific point.

30
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:11,140
Next, calculate its absolute value.

31
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:14,840
It's very important that we take the absolute values.

32
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,660
If not, the positive error might negate.

33
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:21,740
The negative error on the error might show a zero,

34
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:26,740
but the model will be highly inaccurate and finally

35
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:30,240
calculate the average of the residuals.

36
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,640
So, looking at the above example,

37
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:39,820
the mean absolute error will be 10 plus 20 plus 10 plus 10 plus

38
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:46,340
100 divided by five would be the value off 30.

39
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:51,040
Next is means choir error R M S P.

40
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,640
It is very similar to mean absolute error,

41
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,840
but we will be squiring the difference between the predicted on actual value

42
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,440
instead of calculating the absolute to calculate embassy.

43
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,740
First, calculate the residual value at each point.

44
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:15,640
Next, calculate the Squire value off each reserve ALS and finally,

45
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:21,140
some all the values and calculate the average of The results in

46
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:28,610
our case means square error will be 100 plus 400 plus 100 plus

47
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:34,980
100 plus 10,000 developed by five, which gives us a value off 21.

48
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:43,870
40 means square error are generally larger compared to M A and it penalizes

49
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:49,740
larger error and it is very effective in protecting outliers.

50
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:52,800
Next is root mean square error.

51
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,340
R R M sc.

52
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:59,240
This represents a standard deviation off the residuals or,

53
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:04,840
in other words, how large the residuals are dispersed from the mean.

54
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:09,980
Our MSC are recommended over embassy because they can be easily

55
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:14,340
interpreted as they match the units off the output.

56
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:17,220
To calculate our embassy performed the three steps

57
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:20,150
that you did to compute MVC on.

58
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:24,820
Then Squire rode the result on for our example autumn etc.

59
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:32,070
Will be 4 to 6.26 The challenge with embassy are a remesy is

60
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:36,740
that the value can range from zero to infinity,

61
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:38,230
which may be hard to interpret.

62
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:46,410
The result mean absolute percentage error are app is similar to m A.

63
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:52,240
By the error will be represented as a percentage instead off a positive number.

64
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:58,440
A limitation with maybe is if any of the data point has a value of zero,

65
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:02,230
it may yield incorrect value as it involves a

66
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:06,740
division operation to calculate M app.

67
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:14,240
First you calculate the residual, then divided by the actual value.

68
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,940
Next you get the absolute value offered.

69
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:28,000
Then you find the average of the results, and finally you multiply that by 100 converted in a percentage farmer.
