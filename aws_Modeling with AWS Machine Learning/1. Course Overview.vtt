[Autogenerated] Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.610
My name is Sarah Vaughan and Dan Tapani on Welcome to My code on

3
00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:14.330
Modeling with AWS Machine Learning on an architect Working and

4
00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:19.380
Travel Domain focused on middleware on cloud technologies When it

5
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.840
comes to machine learning, AWS Sage maker has been the industry leader,

6
00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.840
offering many services that complements the entire lifecycle

7
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.140
from data preparation to model deployment.

8
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.400
In this course,

9
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.820
you will learn how to map a business problem to a machine learning problem,

10
00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.150
understand convolution and recommend neural networks on the built in

11
00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.560
algorithms offered by sage maker Pluralsight Sage Maker Notebook.

12
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.790
Instance download on prepare banking dataset that will

13
00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.640
be used in the training process.

14
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.940
Create an estimator object on monitor the training run

15
00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.700
in a sage maker console and finally, leverage sage makers automated,

16
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.690
hyper parameter tuning to determine optimal hyper parameter

17
00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.640
values that feels the best performance metrics.

18
00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.050
By the end of this course,

19
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.130
you will know all the features on benefits offered by AWS sage

20
00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.700
maker and how to train you evaluate on tune mission learning

21
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.740
models before beginning this course,

22
00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:30.940
you should be familiar with basic python and using Jupyter notebooks.

23
00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:47.000
I hope you will join me on this journey to learn about developing models in AWS. Sage maker Been modeling with AWS Machine Learning Course at Pluralsight
