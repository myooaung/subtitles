00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
in the suite of We're going to take a look at some of the other tags that you can include

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.250
us part off form that XML,

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:09.650
and we'll try to understand the significance.

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:10.600
First off,

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:11.500
which is a description,

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:12.040
Dag,

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.060
here you can provide the description about your project if you like.

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:22.690
You can also point to the properties that you're defined Any a poem that XML maybe wanted

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:26.950
to display the project wash in the project name etcetera.

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:29.700
Then you can just use the syntax,

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:38.020
which is dollar calibrates and then property name have been will end with the curly brace,

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:44.220
just as we did with and pretty simple and straightforward.

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:50.440
And then we have the license of stag within which you would define your project licenses.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.080
He would write down all the license storms within the text file.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:59.940
You woulda poured it into some Web server and then point to it with a your you're going to

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.420
provide that your last part of this euro tag under the license tag along with that would

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.570
also need to provide some name to it.

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.330
You can give any name that you wish and distribution talks about hope.

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.550
People get download and use your project.

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:15.420
In this case,

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.810
we had said it to ripple,

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:23.320
meaning that people can download this particular project from Repository and use it

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.320
comments.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.850
As the name suggests,

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:31.850
just a few words that talks about your project or it's lights and storms,

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:33.000
etcetera.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.880
Under the organization tag,

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:42.120
you can define the name of the organization as well as at sea or low and all the details

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.950
that we were mentioning in all these tags will get displayed.

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.660
Been a gendered the site for your project.

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.050
We're going to take a look at how to Gender Zeit incoming video.

00:01:52.050 --> 00:02:00.290
And then we have this tank developers within which he would list on all the developers who

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.850
are immediately responsible for this project.

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:03.900
In this case,

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:10.930
I just mentioned one single dollar per and the tags are pretty self explanatory.

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:12.990
The name of the developer email I.

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.400
D.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:21.400
His personal website are you are etcetera and have also mentioned the roll off the

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.590
particular developer.

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.320
I've mentioned that he is an architect as well as a developer.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.890
The significance off this is if there is some issue with the project or if there is some

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.530
kind off a crucial Destin that needs to be made in terms off maintain the project,

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:37.250
etcetera.

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.450
Then other developers can actually get in touch with this developer.

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.660
Similarly,

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.780
we have contributors most applicable for open source projects.

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.250
Here we would list down all the list of contributors,

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.310
an example of what you can see in here and again the significance off.

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.480
This is if somebody,

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.010
if some of the contributor wants to contribute to this project,

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.610
and he wanted certain things to get clarified,

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.050
then he can get in touch with this particular developer.

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.580
And apart from these stags,

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.020
we have fueled the tax,

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:18.590
which we cannot use right now but are often used in real world projects,

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:25.810
one of which is this issue management tag and is basically going to point to a centralised

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:26.460
silver,

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:28.490
which is meant for issue management.

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:33.420
If you're ever off tools like Clear Quest Gira from Atlassian,

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:34.250
etcetera,

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:39.430
then this is a tag that you're going to use to define the silver location because some of

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.960
the pregnancy may need these details to raise an issue or update an issue,

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:44.690
etcetera.

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:49.840
And this is a tank that those plug ins refer to to get the details about the defect

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:57.410
tracking to and then we have one for C I management or continuous integration.

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:59.830
Management has evolved.

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:01.740
Mentioned in really old projects,

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.320
we have a central a silver,

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.560
where every time you make a comet,

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.870
or every time you make changes in your code,

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.780
there's going to be some built happening.

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.710
So whenever that build happens,

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:16.910
we want the developers to get notified about the results.

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:22.270
And this is very would configure on what basis should the notification be sent.

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:29.230
So in here have pointed to that server and have also mentioned the stag noted fires Onda,

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:34.140
which I mentioned that on what basis should the notification be sent,

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:41.480
like send on ever there is some build error than we want to send the notification so that

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:45.950
dollar purse will be notified about the issue so that somebody can take a look at it.

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:49.330
There are other tags as well.

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.780
You can just quickly take a look at documentation.

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.520
We just google out this particular tag.

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:56.890
You should be getting a link,

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:01.090
and we have one for mailing this,

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.850
and this is to give the dollar pastilles uploaded with the project.

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:09.070
And here are some of the times that you would define us part of the mailing list,

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:15.600
so subscribe would just define the address with what you can subscribe to the mailing list

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:15.600
.

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.250
And if you want to unsubscribe from the mailing list,

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:22.250
this is address to which need to send email.

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:25.350
Post will talk about the user,

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:29.670
basically from whom you want to send the email.

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:35.340
The archive simply points to list off subscribers who wish to receive the email

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:36.430
notifications.

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:38.090
So that's about it.

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:41.950
It's have never I've never really used it personally,

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:50.750
and we have one for software configuration management or SCM.

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:51.980
Again,

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:55.000
this this is more relevant in real world projects.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:55.740
Basically,

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:58.410
we have a central server to manage or code,

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:03.720
so you would define that particular silver in here so that may even can communicate with it

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:03.720
.

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:04.850
This connection,

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:13.970
your will will actually allow maven to read the project from the repository and then get it

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:17.150
into your local computer so it so that you can start working on it.

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:20.350
And then we have this developer connection,

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:27.240
which basically points to the your little where when there some changes introduced in your

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:27.890
project.

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:35.720
And when the developer tries to submit those changes This is the Ural that maven uses to

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.190
incorporate or delivered those changes.

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:39.210
And basically,

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:40.690
we have other tags.

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:41.550
This is best,

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:42.250
Scully.

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:43.880
The project your low.

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:46.500
I'm not sure of what the stag means,

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:48.500
but he got the idea,

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:48.760
right?

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:52.440
So And finally we have the spirit.

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:53.480
Was that stag?

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:59.880
Sometimes we may have plug ins that won't work with previous worsens off maven,

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:02.260
but they work with all the abortions off.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.100
Maybe that are throughout.

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:04.330
Oh,

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:04.980
in the bow.

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:09.450
Then you can add the stag prerequisites and then mentioned the maven abortion.

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:11.690
The maid inversion is not.

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:14.650
Or if it is previous to throughout old,

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:18.620
then you're going to see an ever the builders not going to happen.

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:22.600
So that's about all these tags.

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:23.760
And in next,

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:23.940
really,

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:27.830
we're going to take a look at how to generate this site for your project,

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:32.050
thereby You will see all these details getting populated over there.

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:33.790
See you soon.
