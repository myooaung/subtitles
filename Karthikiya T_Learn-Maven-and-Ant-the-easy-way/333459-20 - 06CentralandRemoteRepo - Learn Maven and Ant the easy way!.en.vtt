00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.290
in this week,

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:05.150
we're going to talk about the central repository and the remote repository.

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:09.620
We already had some fair amount off understanding on Central Repository.

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:10.580
Its purpose,

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:12.490
etcetera Escalators,

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:17.670
The default depository there may even would look for dependent jars that your project

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.190
depends on and then is going to download into a local depository.

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:24.380
We already talked about it,

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.790
but the reason why I brought this up again is to tell you that you can actually applaud

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:32.650
your own artifact into the central depository.

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:34.580
And here's a link for that.

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:41.650
I've provided this link as part of the downloaded files in here in this file,

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.250
come in and other differences dot Txt.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:50.530
So here are some of the guidelines which is to follow before you plan to upload your

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.720
artifact and make it public for entire world to use.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.270
And they're basically highlighting that unit.

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.490
Introduce these coordinates following certain good practices.

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:06.200
And we had already talked about those good practices like he doesn't get on Doman name on

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.140
the project name as the artifact.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:09.210
I d worsen,

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.880
etcetera.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.830
That pretty much have same thing to mention,

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.240
and in addition to that,

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.550
you have to take some security measures using so called the PGP signature.

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.550
I got the stands for pretty good privacy.

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:23.480
Basically,

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:28.420
if you go to repository and take a look at any artifact present that such for Jane,

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:42.440
it you would notice that we also have these files that end with dot MD five in dot Shawon.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:43.600
Well,

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.050
these files have something to do with those security measures were to follow.

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.600
Shall one is the algorithm which is followed to encrypt the data.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:53.460
Well,

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.180
it's really beyond the scope of this tutorial to talk about all this,

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.250
but I'm just letting you know along with that,

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.650
we also have this file that end with Dark Palm.

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:04.370
Well,

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:09.400
this is actually going to talk about the project so that we get to know to whom this

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:14.980
project belonged to their website and the description of the project etcetera.

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:20.530
And the important thing about this file is that this file would actually highlight

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.180
dependencies or dependent jars that this project depends on,

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:31.090
I mean in here with just defined couple off dependent jars.

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.090
But if you go to the local depository,

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.460
moon has actually don't looted a host of other libraries as well.

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:39.500
The reason is,

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.550
maven has not only downloaded the jar that we had requested,

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:49.070
but also the libraries that these jar files are these projects depend on.

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:54.380
So how would we even get to know on what libraries these projects are dependent on?

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.940
Well,

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.180
that's by taking a look at the dot bomb file off this projects.

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:04.850
So we have that file for it's in every project.

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:06.850
Likewise,

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:07.330
we have,

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.750
ah,

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.190
other steps to be forward to make a wrapped,

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.760
in fact,

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.250
qualify for uploading in the central depository.

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.010
And they're some of the ultimatum repositories,

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.950
which you can use,

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.190
and these are all approved by a party foundation.

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:23.530
So no,

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.930
that's it.

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.410
On Central depository,

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:32.470
let's no talk about the remote repository in simple terms at Remote Repository is equal int

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.030
off a central depository.

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.760
But the difference is remote.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.350
Repository is going to recite within an organization.

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:40.940
For example,

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:42.280
you are a company,

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.130
and you have multiple teams working on multiple different projects,

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:48.250
and they're all dependent on each other.

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:54.250
So you're going to configure the more depository where he would store all your artifact.

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:55.220
Also,

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.060
in addition to that,

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.430
whatever the artifact decide in the remote triple history can only be accessed within

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.950
organization but are not available for outside world.

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:06.550
And this is actually most likely be the case.

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:09.490
If you're working in a corporate company,

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:13.120
they're not really going to manage their products that central the upholstery,

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.430
but they would have their own depository.

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:16.200
And in fact,

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.750
it's really easy to configure your own depository,

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.250
although I don't recommend you to do it right now,

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:26.490
because conferring your own depository is not needed for a single person.

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:32.790
It is majorly meant for organizations or companies where multiple teams will work on

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:36.280
multiple projects and the one to coordinate each other.

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.780
And another reason is all these Softwares,

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:40.660
which do the job off repository,

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.080
are going to demand high performing computers.

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.160
So you need to have good memory,

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:46.560
sippy,

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:47.850
a processing capabilities,

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:50.670
etcetera to be able to support this software's.

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:52.770
But just for your information,

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.250
it's very easy to set up.

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:59.770
All you have to do is to download a repository manager like the one from the J.

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:03.310
Frog with the name Happy Factory.

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:10.730
It's a pretty popular repository software just after Donald the Zip file extracted in some

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:13.850
folder and done on this particular script,

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:22.100
and that will set up the Arctic factory on the particular server and you can run another

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:23.550
script to start the server.

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:26.850
I stopped the server etcetera.

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:28.770
Pretty straightforward.

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:34.520
And the beauty of this is you don't have to install a separate Tomcats over or anything of

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:35.170
that sort.

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:40.910
Everything is built in all the essential tools are built in into this one single entity,

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:44.350
and you can just install all in one go.

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:50.590
So this reporter software is kind of like an FTP software where there's more tuned to sell

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:51.650
the purpose off.

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:54.810
Acting as a repository to manage the artifact,

00:05:54.810 --> 00:06:03.650
etcetera have also provided the link to this in this file can take a look at it.

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:07.910
So once you set up your server,

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:15.860
that remote repository all you have to do is to go to your poem that XML and,

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:16.150
uh,

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:20.070
Justin tried to override the central depository.

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:24.760
So you take this tag and populated inside the upon the XML,

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:26.400
but it's not recommended.

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:31.150
The recommended way is to make this change in the settings are XML file.

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:36.110
You'll be able to locate that section repositories.

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:38.550
And here is where you would define that tip artistry.

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:40.140
Along with that,

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:42.610
your the idea specific to this.

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:43.120
After that,

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:44.950
you install etcetera.

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:49.850
You basically have to follow their documentation and customers accordingly.

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:51.870
But it's pretty straightforward.

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:52.750
No big deal,

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:55.250
but it's certainly not needed for us.

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:56.040
I mean,

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:58.410
if you're an individual and not a company,

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:01.900
then you probably don't need to try to set up the software.

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:04.080
All right,

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:08.910
I think we're getting more and more comfortable with Megan and will continue in next video

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:08.910
.

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:09.730
See you soon.
