00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.120
in this video,

00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:03.440
we're going to talk about maven profiles.

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:04.860
But before we do,

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:08.950
let us take a look at one of the problems we may be having with our project.

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:14.980
Let's say that you're able to run or build a project successful in your local enrollment.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.720
That doesn't mean things look smoothly elsewhere.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:19.340
I mean,

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:24.060
say that you're running java 10 on your computer and all the plug ins that you have

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.280
installed or that you have used in your project may be compatible with Java 10.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:33.650
So things will book smoothly in your computer and build a successful.

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.190
But when you try to submit those changes to a centralized server,

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.880
it may not be the case that the silver is also holding our 10 abortion.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.840
It may be using previous washing,

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:44.950
maybe Java nine.

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:46.150
In that case,

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.070
build may not work out smooth,

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.360
and it would introduce a lot of problems.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:51.940
The build will fail,

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:52.950
etcetera.

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.250
So how to solve this problem?

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.140
One solution is every time you try to submit those changes,

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:04.400
you have to make changes in your bomb that XML and change the worsens off all the plug ins

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.740
and make them fit to run on the other enrollment.

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:08.320
Well,

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.570
how pleasing it is to hear it is not so.

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.910
The solution is simply creating a profile.

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:18.250
Let me show you what I mean so that you'll have a better picture.

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.010
So for this purpose,

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:25.250
I'm actually created this directory with the name profile example within which I have

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.130
despond or XML file in the list of files that you downloaded.

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.910
You must be able to look at this.

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:35.050
So here is the content inside the palm that XML file.

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:40.600
All I have here is just a plug in which is maven and plug in.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.720
And during the clean fears,

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.950
I'm just trying to echo the falling message.

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:45.620
Well,

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.100
this is actually picked up from one of our previous examples.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.550
Everything the same.

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.480
If you go to command,

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:58.860
prompt into the directory where the bomb the XML file is reciting and two Ambien clean,

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.170
I would see that they comb s age.

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.370
Pretty straightforward.

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:05.260
Now,

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:10.420
imagine that this plug in will not work in a mother enrollment where the build will take

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:10.950
place.

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.770
So in that case,

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.100
whatever do is let me get it off this first,

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:22.600
and then I'm going to create a profile that looks like this.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:28.550
I would define the stand profiles under which we can have multiple profiles.

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:29.680
In my case,

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.970
I've just defined one profile with the profile tank,

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:39.040
and I'm going to uniquely identify that profile with an identify where you can give any

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.450
string that you wish in here.

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:46.450
And we're going to use that string to activate this profile while we run the command.

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.050
So inside the profile,

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.330
whatever I would define in here,

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.430
I would make it fit for that other enrollment I'm talking about.

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.950
And typically water the tags that you would introduce as part off the project tank.

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.160
You can pretty much introduce those tags as part of the profile as well.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:11.320
So you never taken Think off profile as upon the XML reciting inside another bomb that XML

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.320
?

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:12.270
Not exactly,

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:13.660
but close enough.

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:19.050
So I'm just going to copy this entire build from here,

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.610
and I'm going to pass it over here now,

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:29.400
assume that I have done some customization is in here to make it work with that other

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.180
enrollment.

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.410
When they display different message in here,

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:39.950
I'll just simply say from profile now from the command prompt.

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:45.050
What am I going to do is instruct doing Amen clean.

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:47.550
I'm also going to send one para meter,

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:49.660
which is hyphen capital P.

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.170
That means I'm going to activate a profile.

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.450
And what is the name that I'm going to provide?

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:00.250
It's identifying name that I set in here,

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.250
slim into the same and hit enter.

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:11.190
This time we're seeing that particular message from profile.

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:15.070
So what we're trying to do here is we're tryingto alright.

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:18.850
This particular plug in with display gin.

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:24.300
Now this house sold or problem in my enrollment.

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.290
Aiken do Ambien clean.

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:33.610
But in the other enrollment I would do and being clean with that profile so that I can just

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:38.950
Moodley work on my project without worrying about making changes every time I come in the

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:39.650
changes.

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:49.300
I've also included one document with the name profiles dot darks.

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.300
It has lot off information.

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.130
We're going to talk about it in a second.

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:59.850
But he wrote the list off tags that you can use inside the profile.

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:05.550
So we've taken a look at how to act with a profile from the command line.

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:07.750
Isn't the hyphen p option,

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:11.760
but there are a lot of other ways as well for example,

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:17.410
Let's say that we wanted to activate profile based on the Jerrick abortion to limit the

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:19.550
scope it this piece off court From here,

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:21.450
Let's go back.

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:29.190
And instead of providing and identify where I went to provide this activation tag and say

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:29.700
one,

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:37.100
about five in here were mentioning that this profile needs to be activated when the running

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:40.090
Jerrick abortion starts with one about five.

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:41.290
In our case,

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:42.970
we have the latest Jerrick abortion,

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:45.260
which is Washington at the moment.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:46.680
By the time of this recording,

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.450
so things shouldn't work,

00:05:49.450 --> 00:06:00.650
and we should still see the normal message from the original Pom XML up from the profile.

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:06.850
So now let's try to change this wash in to Washington,

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:11.990
and this time I'm expecting that this message will get displayed.

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:17.750
And sure enough,

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:20.700
things worked well,

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:27.390
so you can also act with a profile best on the genetic abortion.

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:31.150
But if you'd like to choose a set off Jerrick abortions,

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:33.440
which this profile support,

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:36.440
then you can specify it as follows.

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:37.080
In this case,

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:41.480
I'm just mentioning it could be any off these Jerrick abortions.

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:43.870
Similarly,

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:51.990
we can also activate a profile based on the operating system and we have a lot of other

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:57.300
ways to act to it are to activate the profile.

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:58.570
In this case,

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:03.740
we're just checking to see if the property debug is set or not.

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:06.470
If it is set than the profile will be activated.

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:11.550
And here we're checking to see the debug option is not set.

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:14.450
Only then do we want to activate this profile,

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:19.740
and we're checking to see if the debug it's not true.

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:25.040
If the value of the property debug is not set to true,

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:27.250
then we won't activate this profile.

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:32.270
We can also act with the profile based on the system property.

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:34.560
And in my case,

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:38.680
I'm just checking to see if the test system properties set or not.

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:40.190
If it is,

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:42.400
then a profile would be activated.

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:46.480
So here's the command,

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:47.490
Tu said.

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:49.500
That and Roman property,

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:57.840
you can also activate profile from settings or XML file by introducing the stack active

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:02.750
profiles under which you would define your active off our list.

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:09.900
So here's the syntax for that when you have multiple profiles declared in here,

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:12.650
then when you try to run the command,

00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:15.140
you may want to exclude certain profiles,

00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:16.650
and this is how you do it.

00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:18.150
You're deals,

00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:22.540
this estimation mark to exclude a particular profile.

00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:25.300
So that's about it.

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:26.550
Pretty straightforward.

00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:31.460
And thanks for watching,

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:32.150
see assume.
