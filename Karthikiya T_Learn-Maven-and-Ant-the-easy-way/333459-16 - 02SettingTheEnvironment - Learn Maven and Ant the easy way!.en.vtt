00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.180
in this video,

00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:05.190
we're going to take a look at how to set up the enrollment to start using may have in

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:06.130
setting up.

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:11.900
The enrollment for maven is equal into setting up the enrollment for and and the steps are

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:12.660
similar.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.290
So the first thing that we need to do Mr Download dmelvin binaries has a zip file.

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:22.180
Extract that the fire in some folder in our local machine.

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:23.410
So let's do that.

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.150
And for that purpose,

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:31.760
go to Google and search for this term download maven and click on the first thing that you

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.930
see and make sure that the website is pointing to a patch it out or GTA.

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.050
So this explains that Marion is also from a battery foundation.

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.620
So here we have two kinds of files.

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.550
One is with the sore scored and the other is without the source code.

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.250
Make a guess on which one we need to download,

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:53.120
obviously,

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.550
without a source code.

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:55.220
At the moment,

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.050
we have nothing to do with the made in source code,

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.460
so let's just download the binary version off this.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:09.170
I've already done that and have also extracted the ZIP file in my directory like so and

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.550
here is,

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.890
ah,

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:11.050
content in it.

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.710
So once you have it extracted in some directory,

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.750
just copy it and we'll go to the next step,

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.120
which will be to make sure that the Java home is set.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.960
It always advised the two said,

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.820
this enrollment variable and most likely chances are that you have already done that.

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.710
If you're able to run double programs and create job application and run them on the

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:36.080
browser,

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.850
etcetera,

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.720
then you must have this enrollment very below that,

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:41.210
it said.

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.170
But just for your information,

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.620
they should point to the home directory off your Jerry K And in order to check if this is

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:49.600
working fine,

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:55.350
just go to command processor and type in job a hyphen version,

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.320
and it must show you the current abortion.

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.010
It's Java hyphen,

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:01.710
Warsh in in lower case,

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.160
and it must display the current job abortion.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.200
So once you make sure of that,

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:15.360
the next thing that you need to add is to add this M two enrollment variable,

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.230
and it should point to the been Dell'Utri off the moving home directory.

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:21.840
But before that,

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.310
letters at this enrollment variable them to underscore home.

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.400
Let's copy it and will point to the home directory off maven.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:46.710
So let us go toe windows and then search for and the moment very bolts and went at a new

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.160
endowment variable.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:56.520
And it should point to the home directory wherever you have extracted those binaries sub

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.780
click.

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:57.450
OK,

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.150
and second thing is dragged this empty available as well.

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:11.770
This is where you would have all those script and we would pointed to the BIN directory And

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:17.400
always try to use this syntax to define your endowment variables.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.270
Basically,

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:21.890
what this does is this is equal into me,

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:24.680
typing the entire part off the moving home directory.

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:25.700
Basically,

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:31.010
whatever M two home points to will be reflected in here as well.

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.870
This is good because at little point of time,

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.090
if you switch to latest version off maven,

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:43.510
then you can just change this empty home variable and it will get reflected everywhere else

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:43.510
.

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:49.250
So the part that m two points to will be updated as well.

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.570
So let us give it this van hit.

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:54.350
Okay,

00:03:54.350 --> 00:04:00.450
We're going to add one more endowment variable which will be this system part variable.

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.390
And it would point to the bin directory again.

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.450
Letters use the syntax took your part.

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.760
Let us chills part and then click Edit.

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:20.970
And in here I'm going to add essentially this particular pat wherever m two points to I

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.350
went to add a new one It okay,

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:27.850
and the reason why you need to add the spot variable.

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:32.180
His basically Melvin is also a command line tool.

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:37.820
And in order for us to be able to run the Maven commands from any director from command

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:38.490
processor,

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:43.870
then you need to add the part two that bin directory as part of the path variable.

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:45.940
So basically,

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:49.350
let's go to command line and now type in,

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:51.950
maybe hyphen version.

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:56.830
Now this Ambien script is not deciding in this directory user,

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:57.480
said men,

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:02.190
so the operating system will go and take a look at all the part that are mentioned in the

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:05.150
path variable to see if the script is present there.

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:10.280
So since we've all their specified the part variable that points to the BIN directory,

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:11.950
this would essentially work.

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:16.050
And here it is.

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:21.450
If we're able to see the maven version that you have downloaded and set up,

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:23.000
then you're good to go.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.920
Also,

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:30.350
I assume that you have the clips and Roman said so that's about it.

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.790
See,

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:31.350
assume
