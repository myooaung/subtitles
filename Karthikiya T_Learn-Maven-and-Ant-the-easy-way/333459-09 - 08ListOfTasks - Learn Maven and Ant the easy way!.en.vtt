00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.890
No,

00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:05.700
I think it's perfect time to talk about all the list off tests available in end.

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:12.570
I have listed on all the most commonly used and tasks there a few more tests around listed

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:13.090
here.

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:18.790
The reason is there not either used commonly or they're not off high importance.

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:19.560
And in fact,

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.300
I think we have covered about 280% off tasks available in,

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.250
and I'm going to walk you through each one of these.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:32.720
I've actually picked up these definitions from the official Apache dot org's website.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.000
In fact,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.570
each and every task name that you're seeing here is an euro that will take you to the

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.050
documentation off that particular task.

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:46.250
You can just click on Control Key and then click these tag names,

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.980
and that will take you to the respecto documentation of that particular task.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:51.510
So,

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:51.840
first,

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.050
let's start with this year or task.

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.280
This will help you create an enterprise application archive.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.450
That's what year stands for,

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:04.360
and this is basically combination off jar files as well as of our files,

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.150
and that's why we have to define those two in here.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:12.580
We're including all the jar files and Barr files and we're picking them from this directory

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.580
.

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:19.760
So reviews this type file set to be able to bundle them as an enterprise application

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:20.390
archive.

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.730
But the name my app dot er very simple.

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:28.350
And if you are aware off enterprise applications,

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.260
you probably know the significance off application dot xml.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:33.010
If you don't,

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.920
that's fine as well.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.410
Just try to understand what this task is doing,

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:38.690
basically creating an archive file.

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:39.830
And similarly,

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:45.600
we have another task for Jar that will create a jar file and is actually combination off

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.690
bunch of dark class files as well as some resources like Properties,

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:51.050
files or XML files,

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.690
etcetera.

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:58.030
The way Barca file is actually combination off jar files as well as some plants,

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:59.650
are technologies like html,

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:00.450
jsp,

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.250
CSS in majors,

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:02.990
etcetera.

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.950
And this is the task used to create of our file.

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:11.460
We're actually going to take a look at this example when we try to write a boat or XML file

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.260
for our sample application,

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.470
and if you're a pair of Lennox,

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.140
you probably know what is our PM.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.830
It is kind of like an installer for Lennox.

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.450
Just as we have dot txt file for Windows,

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.650
we have RPM for Lennox in order to build one.

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.350
We can use this task and you will give the spec file.

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.680
But this attribute,

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.510
the tower file is equal into a zip file for Lennox.

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.670
And using this task,

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.100
you can create a tar file.

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:49.950
You're provide the best directory that you wanted to bundle as a tar file with this name,

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.750
manual doctor.

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.650
And in this directory,

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.080
Jesup is coming next.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.660
And that file,

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:58.740
you know what it is.

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:59.710
And here is,

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:00.020
ah,

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:08.710
task to create one in all these three tests or equal into unzip for the following archives

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:12.040
for jar file it Sanjar and for tar file,

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.050
it's on tower and for waffle it's on more as simple as that.

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:22.260
And these are actually list off algorithms you use to create these archives.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.520
And if you created an archive file using these algorithms,

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:32.640
then can use the falling task to unpack those files and as part off compiled us,

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:33.800
we have jealousy.

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.490
We know what it is we've actually taken.

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:36.830
Look at an example off one.

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:41.730
We're going to talk about the job our doc Tafts pretty soon so we'll skip it for now,

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:47.720
and these are set off execution tests the task and will help you run the and target by

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.250
specifying the and file.

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:50.170
In this case,

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:56.480
we want to run the target Compile in the and file sub bulldog maximal under the directory.

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:57.980
It's a project,

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:02.950
not this part is related to to the base directory off this project.

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:10.020
The end called us will help you run another target residing in the same maximal document,

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:11.720
an example of which you can see it.

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:16.980
Over here we have the Stargate default and we're trying to call another target from within

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:17.340
it.

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:18.210
In this case,

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:19.850
we're calling this another target,

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:25.480
which is this and it's just simply going toe print a message and do take a note that the

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.260
message that it prints is sent as a perimeter.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:34.250
So you can also send the perimeter toe in and target like this.

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.850
You brought the name as well as value,

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:39.490
and you can print the value by using its name.

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:44.870
And you have to follow the fallings in tax dollar calibrates and you end with the curly

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:46.140
brace or,

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.840
alternatively,

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.980
can also send the perimeter directly from the command line.

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:58.150
By using this option hyphen Capital D and then you provide the name and the value that you

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:59.610
want to assign to it.

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.590
Pretty straightforward.

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:06.600
The Exit Command does severity off task,

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.750
and it has multiple options in it.

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:09.600
In this case,

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.840
we're trying toe open the index or XML,

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.850
file in the browser.

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:16.770
Inherit can use various options.

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:21.040
You can defer to the documentation and take a look at various options available for you to

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.950
provide in here.

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:25.130
So this is a task exit,

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:31.000
and then you provide executable is going to be this browser.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.350
You would point to the roses executable file and then you provide the file that you want to

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:37.670
open in the browser.

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:39.650
Just try to understand it,

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:40.900
but it is simple.

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.330
We know about the task Java.

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:45.490
It will help us exude a job,

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:46.280
a program,

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:47.690
and in the scales,

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:53.250
the class feel that we're pointing to his main class and then report in the class part.

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:57.540
We've seen an example of the same as well.

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:04.980
The sleep task will help you suspend execution often and file for a certain period of time

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:04.980
.

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:10.150
They could be certain scenarios where you might need to wait for certain time before you

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:12.740
execute a task for example.

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:16.950
Let's say that you have couple off times when its top loader file and the other is to

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:18.090
download the same file.

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:22.780
Then the Donald has need to wait for a sudden beard off time for upload to happen.

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:23.410
I mean,

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:24.690
just to give an example.

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:28.250
There's a list of file times that will help you manage,

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:33.620
played with files and in here this task at Trib will help you,

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:37.420
said the permissions off a file in the Windows operating system.

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:38.230
In this case,

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:42.520
we want to set the file permission off this file to read only mode,

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:44.450
and we wanted to hide it.

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:51.900
And the staff will actually help you manipulate the group ownership off a file or list of

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:52.470
files.

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:55.910
And this is actually relevant to land X operating system.

00:06:55.910 --> 00:07:00.440
So you should have some understanding on the commands that you run online X to set the file

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:00.910
permissions,

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:01.630
etcetera.

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:08.180
Then you probably know this command change group and the same is the case with this.

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:16.250
CH moored will help you set permissions off a file or set of files inside a directory and

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:19.600
and C H own stands for change owner.

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:25.290
And this is again Atlantic's command the equal and off that command is this task.

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:29.990
And if you know what this command does in line X,

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:32.290
then you probably know what this task is doing in here.

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:37.300
The copy command will help you copy a file or set off files or a directory.

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:43.970
Bears don't watch providing here the files a type and the deal it task.

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:45.130
As the name suggests,

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:49.950
it will help you delete a file or several files or a directory Hasn't Blezard.

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:52.710
We know what filtered us?

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:54.550
Pretty straightforward.

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:55.920
In this example.

00:07:55.920 --> 00:08:00.630
We wanted to copy a settle files from Source Directory to Destination Directory.

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:01.670
And while doing so,

00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:08.150
we want to replace the string ear with 2000 and using get command,

00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:10.260
you can get a file from a euro.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:13.550
So this will essentially download this file index dot html.

00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:17.370
The make do is again specific to Lennox.

00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:20.860
The Make their Task Strands form a directory.

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:23.000
It will help you create a directory.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:30.010
The move command will help you move a specific file or several files or directories.

00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:36.020
The replace will help you replace their Qurans off a given string with another string in a

00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:40.710
file or set off files pretty self explanatory.

00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:44.180
So in here we wanted to replace the falling token.

00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:46.950
With this value in this file,

00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:53.000
I mean all the estimable files reciting in the current directory source directory.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:09:00.270
The replay sickle expression will help you replace the text that matters with the falling

00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:03.490
legal expression with the following.

00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:09.050
And here is the file that you wanted to perform that operation on.

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:14.810
You can manipulate defile permission off several files,

00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:20.040
depending on what type that Ugo inside the set permissions tag.

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:22.950
And this is specific to Lennox as well.

00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:28.180
And you probably know what touch commanders in Line X.

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:30.660
If you ever worked with applications overs,

00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:33.420
then this will come in handy again.

00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:34.650
This Islamic specific.

00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:35.950
All right,

00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:36.970
I think that's it.

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:39.850
On Task Pretty is the stuff.

00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:44.010
I'll see you soon.
