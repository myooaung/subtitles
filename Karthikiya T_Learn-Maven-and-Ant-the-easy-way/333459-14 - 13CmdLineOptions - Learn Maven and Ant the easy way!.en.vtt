00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
this week is just to let you know that we have multiple options to set while running the

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:05.350
and command.

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:08.270
In order to see all the list off options available,

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:12.090
you can just type in end and then hyphen help hit,

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.450
enter and then you would be able to see all the options.

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.060
You don't have to know each and everything in here.

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:20.450
Typical liver dues,

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:21.480
only few of them.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.440
And in fact,

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.050
we had all that explored all those important ones.

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.730
Hyphen help option,

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:29.280
for instance,

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:33.600
is going to help you display the help information and is the one which we've used to

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.050
display the falling content.

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.650
We also have the project help option to display the description about the project.

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:42.210
Basically water the texture to pro had written.

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.750
The description tag in your XML will get the spread here.

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.190
Hyphen version is going to display the version information off,

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:50.820
and similarly,

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.480
we've also talked about the verbals,

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.000
which is the default log level.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.110
We got debug as well,

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.150
and that will help us print the debugging information.

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:04.980
We can also point to a library that you're and file is going to need.

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.110
Rip roaring dis option hyphen,

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.600
lib and then you go the pot to the directory.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:17.010
You can also use this option happen log file and then give some file name here to dump all

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.230
the log in information to that file Useful for debugging purposes.

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.080
He can also said the logger logger level.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.630
Basically,

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.070
we've talked about it already.

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.450
And if you're Bill file name is not build our XML,

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.760
then you have to provide this option build file and then the name of Dicks.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:34.100
Imo.

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.450
So likewise,

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.510
we got host off other options,

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:38.260
the class.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:42.310
But you can also disable the class part altogether by pouring this option.

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.850
No class part etcetera.

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.230
Just take a look at it.

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:50.830
Get a sense off what each one of these are doing again.

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:51.250
Honestly,

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:52.800
don't have to know each and every thing.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.460
I think we've already talked about more than what is really required.

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.390
So that's it on this video
