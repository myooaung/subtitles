00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.740
in this,

00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:00.970
really?

00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:06.070
Let us try to understand the significance off settings or XML file that recites under the

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:09.650
contradictory under the Apache maven Home Directory.

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:16.410
Basically water the tags that you introduced within the form that XML will have impact only

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.650
within that project,

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:22.460
wherever the bomb direct Immel file is reciting and within the child projects.

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:27.680
But whereas when you have certain configurations set within the settings or XML file,

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:33.750
they will have impact across all the maven projects that you work on in your computer.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.790
We're going to take a look at what goes inside the settings or XML file in in a while.

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.100
Also,

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.670
another reason why you want to use this settings are XML file is when you have sensitive

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:46.190
data like,

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.810
for example,

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:47.720
passwords.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:55.130
We don't want to put passwords in from the XML file because if you introduce a password and

00:00:55.130 --> 00:01:00.200
accidentally you commit all the changes off your project to a central depository,

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.160
then everybody would be able to take a look at your passport.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:10.640
So it's safer to set all your passwords or other sensitive data inside the settings or XML

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.660
file so that nobody can actually take a look at it because they're not really going to

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:21.110
submit the settings or XML file into repository to let somebody take a look at it or

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:21.540
something.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.070
But before we move for their,

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.450
as I've already mentioned in one of the videos discovered,

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.600
this,

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.950
settings or XML file into our daughter into directory.

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.350
That's because if you mess up with configurations,

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.350
then you always have another copy.

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.250
So your little safe.

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:47.410
So copy that settings are XML file from this folder to the daughter into folder,

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:49.160
and then and then you can play with it.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.470
I had this file open here,

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.200
and you can't just put everything what you would put in upon the XML file,

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.380
Although you can put technically,

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:04.110
it's not recommended what is recommended by default,

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.850
we must be seeing all these comments,

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.610
and they actually talk about what are all the things that you can introduce in the settings

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:11.500
or XML file?

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.040
And in this video,

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.770
I'm just going to walk you through all of them,

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.650
the first of which is the local depository.

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.210
So here's the tag,

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:22.750
the sort of all that he talked about it,

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.120
who can give a part in here,

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:31.480
and from that point maybe will treat this location as the local depositary location and by

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:32.120
default.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.490
This is set to this directory underdog.

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:37.080
Him too.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:43.770
And we want to take a look at an example off the interactive mode,

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:48.490
especially when you're trying to create a maven project from the command line.

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:53.670
We thought off provided all the coordinates required right within the command.

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.050
And then we also said this flag interactive mode to faults.

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.350
And if you have this set inside the settings or XML file,

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:07.860
then if there is a problem within the maven build may even build will not stop even if

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:08.950
there is a prompt.

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:09.930
But,

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:10.100
you know,

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:11.320
it just had this default.

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:16.520
Only if you're sure that you're providing all the required para meters right when you run

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:20.200
the command and this particular configuration will come in handy.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.100
Especially if you have a built over running and you would build the projects with the maven

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.750
command,

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.110
then you want to set just defaults.

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.900
The default is true.

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:36.550
Of course you can said this flag offline to true.

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:41.330
And from that point maven will not be able to communicate with the outside world.

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.800
No,

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:42.130
actually,

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:46.850
Petipa's would be going it will enter into the offline mode.

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:52.960
When you tried to set this to true do make sure that you have all the artifacts required

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.020
for your project under your local depository.

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.190
Otherwise,

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:02.580
simply things will break and you may want to set this for security reasons.

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.370
And then we have plug in groups.

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.780
It's just simply stopped locations.

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.750
We're plug ins are reciting,

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.900
and they basically have the group I D.

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:23.000
And by default these two group ideas of considered we thought you providing them.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.060
And basically,

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.980
that's the reason if you go to the effective bomb,

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:31.650
you have not off plug ins in here.

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:40.070
But none of them are actually having the coordinates.

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:47.070
That's because May even knows the location off this plug ins based on the default plug in

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:52.250
groups so maven would navigate to these directories,

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.050
orga patch email and plug ins.

00:04:54.050 --> 00:05:02.560
And if the plug in is not available here than it would go here and so on and so forth this

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:03.350
clitoral Travis.

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:07.850
True off the group ideas are pregnant groups that you would introduce in your settings XML

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:08.190
file,

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:12.040
and we have the proxies,

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:13.540
usually in companies.

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:18.860
We have proxies overs none of the devices within the company would be able to communicate

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.100
with the outside world.

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:23.240
They always communicate through proxies.

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:27.390
So to outside world it is a proxy server which is communicating,

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:31.460
and from inside all the computers will talk to proxies.

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:34.590
It's like the proxies are off acting like a mediator.

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:38.410
Between you were local network and the Internet.

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:41.290
I've talked about this a little bit in my soul.

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:45.460
It's networking and jails because you can take a look at it if you wish.

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:48.240
But if you have approx is over.

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.710
He went to provide the details off it in here.

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:57.670
And sometimes you may need to actually configure additional servers.

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:59.560
For example,

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:02.110
say that you're configuring your own depository.

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:04.890
He would pull out all the deposit of the details,

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:08.290
just as we did here with the central depository.

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:11.000
So we have one in here,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:18.250
but but you don't want to leave all the sense to data like user name password in here.

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:27.100
So we would better configure it as part of the silver stag under settings or XML file and

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:30.850
basically would map those two entries.

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:34.480
The depositor in the silver isn't the identify air.

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:36.810
What are the idea that you defined in here.

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:43.250
You're going to use the same I d to define your repository just just to give an example.

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:46.570
The Gnostic configure mirrors.

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:51.730
What is the mirror when you have a server that is highly trafficked?

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:56.130
Let's that you have repository that is very high in traffic.

00:06:56.130 --> 00:07:00.250
So often times you may want to create a mirror of that server,

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:06.170
essentially creating another silver with the same content as to that off the orginal silver

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:12.400
so that all the new requires that the Sava can't handle due to it being overloaded will get

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:14.190
diverted to mirror servers.

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:21.400
So this is where you would configure those mirror servers and we have profiles.

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:22.920
We're going to talk about profiles,

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:24.050
incoming videos.

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:26.080
All right,

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:27.380
I guess that's about it.

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:28.950
See you soon.
