00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.970
in this,

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:10.150
we're going to take a look at a very simple example on how to display a message using the

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:10.980
end tool.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.340
And for this purpose,

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:17.640
we're actually going to create an XML document within which will specify all the list off

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.870
task that we want end to perform and the way we spurs Ferrell.

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:30.070
This task is by using the standard tag names associated with each one off these tasks.

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:35.550
An example off task could be displaying a message or compelling a Java file.

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:36.490
Likewise,

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:41.620
we have list off tags associated with each and every task that we can perform using,

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.910
and but in this example,

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.870
we just concerned about a couple off casts.

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.310
The first task is to display a message.

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.900
Obviously,

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.500
the message is going to be our good old hello world message,

00:00:53.500 --> 00:01:00.390
and the other task is to simply create a directory or folder once would define those tasks

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:00.390
.

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:07.110
Isn't there associate ID standard tag names directly going to wrap those tasks with a

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.150
target time,

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:15.250
so the target tank is actually going to act like a container that holds list off tasks,

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:21.250
and this target tank is actually associate ID with a name so that at little point of time

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.450
we can call this target using that name,

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.150
and so our task will get executed.

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.240
But where do we tell the end to call?

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.900
This target is in that name.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.940
We're going to space for that name as part of the project tag,

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:41.720
which is the root tag off all the tanks reciting in XML and as a mandatory,

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.550
a tribute to the stag way to specify at least one target name.

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:54.020
And we're going to specify the name off this target and ultimately handle Perform all the

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.050
list off tests.

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:56.350
Hasem Bless that,

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.010
and this XML document in itself is useless.

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:06.770
It's not going to perform emitting unless we freed the maximal document to the and script.

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.950
Once we feed the maximal document to the and script,

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.090
the ant script is actually going to pass through all the list off task.

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:19.300
And then the end tool will make use off all the list off libraries that we have downloaded

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.950
to perform,

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:21.740
you know,

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.230
to display the message or to create a folder,

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:25.000
etcetera.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.150
So that's all there is to it that's tried to create an XML file.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.550
Let's create a folder first.

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.010
Let's call it.

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:43.720
We can give it any name off your choice inside which I'm going to create an ex Immel

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:44.650
document.

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.630
I went to call it some name.

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:53.750
You can give any name off your choice and make sure that you give the extension as XML and

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.420
I went open with not bad bless.

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.970
Plus,

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.640
it's a very good handed to if you don't have no Pam Plus plus our Dickman,

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:02.580
you'd install one.

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.030
So just as within XML document,

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.450
we're going to define the incurring that is being used as well as the wash in.

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.200
If you've used XML for a while,

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.350
then you would probably know what this means.

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.300
I want to set the Washington Wonder Oh,

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:27.740
and and cording to udf eight and we'll end the tag.

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:32.050
Now here's where our work begins.

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:36.550
So let me specify at task that will display message.

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:43.350
So the name that I'm going to use his echo and this is going to accept one attribute

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:47.450
message and this is basically the message that we wanted to display.

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:59.950
Hello World went in the tank and the other does it wanted to do is to create a directory.

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:07.970
And for that I'm going to use the stag maker stands for make directory and when to specify

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:10.500
the name of the directory and by default.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:17.790
It is going to create directory in the same directory where this file is deciding new

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:19.030
directory,

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:20.780
whatever the name that you would like to give.

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:23.500
And as I mentioned,

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:31.170
we need to wrap all these tasks inside the target tank and target that goes with the name

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:32.170
attribute,

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:35.110
and you can give any name off your choice.

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:40.450
I'm going to say test and we're going to have the end tag as well.

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:46.190
And our parent time,

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:51.080
which will be project tag and as a mandatory,

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:59.760
attribute me to provide the default target that we want the and tool to call in this case,

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.600
we're going to call or target,

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:02.850
which we have just created,

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:06.150
and that's all there is to it.

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.510
We're pretty much done.

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:14.560
Just give proper indentation,

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.350
so that looks little need.

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:21.390
And now all we have to do is to navigate to this directory,

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:22.020
you know,

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:22.450
command,

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:23.250
processor,

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:28.120
and then say,

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:35.160
and you need to provide an argument that is build file and you will provide the name of the

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:35.950
XML,

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:45.570
some name dot xml notice that we're able to run this script and from this director because

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:50.050
we had said Depart variable in Windows and Roman variables,

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:53.750
This wouldn't have been happening without setting it.

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:55.190
So let's hit,

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:57.460
enter and see what's going to happen.

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:59.450
And sure enough,

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:06.530
you see that it has listed the target test as well as list off task putting the square

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:12.430
rackets EKO and make sure and finally within this message,

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:13.950
build successful,

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:16.250
which means there were no errors.

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:18.830
We're pretty good if you go to this.

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:23.950
Doctor Green did have this new day to recreated has,

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:24.680
alas,

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.250
we have seen this message.

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:26.460
Hello,

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:27.050
world.

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:28.440
Lastly,

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:33.830
I'd like to mention that we have you in the name to be some named or XML.

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:34.770
But instead,

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:37.980
if you're Gill build our XML,

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:42.750
then you don't have to specify it while running the command.

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:45.130
You can just say aunt,

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:46.130
because by default,

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:51.570
aunt will assume the final name to be build our XML and this will yield the same result.

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:56.770
And in here you didn't see this major because the directories,

00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:01.910
all that he created any more on tasks on coming videos.

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:06.470
This example is just simply to give you an idea on how the ant works,

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:07.880
etcetera.

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:08.570
So biscuit,

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:09.650
all these tags.

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:11.810
So basically,

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:14.650
for all these tasks that we defined in here,

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:17.350
there's some kind off a code associated with it.

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:20.550
And that court decides in the libraries that we have downloaded.

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:25.190
The end will make use off those libraries to perform or tasks.

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:31.850
And this is what ultimately we want an tool to help us with to perform our task.

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:33.030
So with this,

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:34.250
we had a good start with.

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:36.550
And so now let's explore more.

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:37.910
See you soon.
