00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:00,940
[Autogenerated] Okay,

2
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:04,810
so let's delve into what a dress code employed consists off.

3
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:05,260
First,

4
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:07,970
we're gonna have a look at an overview of the service and then some of

5
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:11,440
the prerequisites required to using the service.

6
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,200
Codedeploy is a managed service from AWS that allows you to

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,570
deploy toe over Service is from over sources.

8
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:21,920
So let's take a look at some of those components.

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:27,580
The address service is that you can deploy to ah Lunda D C to E.

10
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:30,540
C s on arm premise service.

11
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:32,240
Hold on a second, Josh.

12
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,610
You just said a duress service is there.

13
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:35,580
That's right.

14
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:41,540
You can install the CODEDEPLOY agent onto your own V EMS to manage deployments.

15
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:44,940
How cool is that?

16
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:48,860
You can deploy all sorts of things such as code packages,

17
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:52,940
executed ALS scripts and conflict files.

18
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:57,040
You will see more about this layer.

19
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:00,600
You can use code sources such as s three bucket,

20
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,920
get her on even bit bucket and it actually in the pipeline right now.

21
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,050
Toe also integrate.

22
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:10,240
Get up.

23
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,720
Codedeploy makes it so easy to deploy and it fits

24
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,560
perfectly into your automation.

25
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:20,440
Lifecycle on integrates nicely into codepipeline.

26
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:25,050
It handles all of the complexities of deploying your application on

27
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:28,540
going to play exactly how you want it to be deployed.

28
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:31,820
It makes deployments a safe and Seamus process for

29
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:35,810
your users on also your developers.

30
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:39,000
Okay, So who should use AWS?

31
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,440
Codedeploy Codedeploy is aimed at AWS developers,

32
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:49,540
develops engineers, architects and sis at Mons.

33
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:53,520
But this does not mean that it's so exclusive to the people in those jobs.

34
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,000
Codedeploy is for anyone.

35
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,730
He wants to use it.

36
00:01:57,730 --> 00:02:01,760
So I recommend program Is engineers on anyone who

37
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,420
just wants to know more scared?

38
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,740
Take a look.

39
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:09,130
It's a fantastic service you use in your development life cycle.

40
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:12,610
AWS codedeploy can deploy to a multitude of

41
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:14,820
operating systems using the codedeploy.

42
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:15,940
Agent.

43
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:17,110
The agent is a service.

44
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:21,800
Your store locally on your V m codedeploy can be used with Amazon.

45
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,400
Lennox read her enterprise.

46
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,800
Then it's the bun, too.

47
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,310
On window seven.

48
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:29,960
Okay,

49
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:34,310
let's take a look at some of code to play security features that were in place.

50
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:37,640
They're going to keep your information secure.

51
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:42,640
Code employees in the boundaries of the AWS shared responsibility model,

52
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,980
which means that you know that eight of us has your utmost security desires.

53
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:51,060
Our heart I won't allow you to manage your data securely.

54
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:54,240
It supports encryption at rest.

55
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,230
So when your deployment configurations are created,

56
00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:02,300
it will use Kms to encrypt the data stored in Dynamo Devi.

57
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:06,720
The code to play agent connects with codedeploy service using tear less,

58
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,490
which means that all of your data is encrypted in transit.

59
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:15,200
All of the codedeploy actions are monitored for a dress cloudtrail.

60
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,080
This means you can see how all actions happened on by WHO?

61
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:24,600
As cloudtrail logs all of the FBI calls for incident management.

62
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,640
You can use eight of US cloudwatch events to detect and

63
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,510
react to changes in the code of place.

64
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:33,010
Say, such as if a deployment happened,

65
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:37,930
you can create an alert to notify you a duress code if I has been ordered

66
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:42,150
it and vetted by third party auditors such a sock PC,

67
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:50,000
I fed ramp hipper and many more. So you know you're getting a highly secure service to use
