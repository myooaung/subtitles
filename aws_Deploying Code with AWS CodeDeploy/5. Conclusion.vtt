[Autogenerated] who that was not so bad, was it?

2
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.470
And now you're all on your way to be an expert on AWS codedeploy.

3
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:08.790
But before you go,

4
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.690
let's take a look at where to go next and have a look at some inspiration.

5
00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.390
So what's next you ask, and where can you go from here?

6
00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.950
I would suggest looking toe or me as much as possible from your

7
00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.820
software engineer life cycle and start to really implement and

8
00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.200
include as much devils methodologies as possible.

9
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.180
On there are a couple of other service.

10
00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:36.810
Is that tie into codedeploy really well, such as co pipeline and co build.

11
00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:38.620
I followed Froze in here, too.

12
00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.730
For good measure, Werner Vogels is a CDO of AWS.

13
00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.210
He has driven and pointed a duress in innovative directions on

14
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.220
make sure they are ahead of the market curve.

15
00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.070
As you can see from his quote,

16
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.240
he believes that automating as much of the management processes as possible

17
00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:03.050
to remove any manual and human areas is a smart move.

18
00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:10.000
Codedeploy is one of the many service is that eight of us provides, which can help you achieve this goal
