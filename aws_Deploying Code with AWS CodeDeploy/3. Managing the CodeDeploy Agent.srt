1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:04,100
[Autogenerated] Okay, so now we have set up that easy to is this profile,

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:06,400
which is our final prerequisite?

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,780
Let's take a look at managing the CODEDEPLOY.

4
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:11,270
Agent in this next demo.

5
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:12,950
We're going to cover the following.

6
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:14,790
We're going to install the CODEDEPLOY.

7
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:15,570
Agent.

8
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:17,780
We're gonna verify the agent is ruining.

9
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:19,750
Begin, determine Aversion.

10
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:22,230
I'm a go to update the agent.

11
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,460
Okay, so the first part of our demo,

12
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:28,370
we're going to create a Amazon Lennox instance.

13
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:33,960
And then we're going to install the CODEDEPLOY agent more.

14
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,920
Select Amazon Lennox, too.

15
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,740
Frito is fine.

16
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:46,940
All the defaults of fine default storage is fired.

17
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:49,640
I don't need any tax on.

18
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:53,640
I'm going Thio Great.

19
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,770
A security group that allows me to access the instance from my I p address.

20
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:05,440
Only that all looks fine.

21
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,030
Pit launch.

22
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:14,550
I have access to this keeper on Let's launch this instant.

23
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:16,710
Ooh, Awesome.

24
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:17,140
Right.

25
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:19,060
Let's have a look at this.

26
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:22,690
So take the public I p address.

27
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:24,470
Okay, so now that's instances.

28
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:26,590
Readyto ss Section two.

29
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:28,990
Let's go on there.

30
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:30,610
Effect on.

31
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:33,150
The first thing we're going to do is we're going to

32
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:38,340
update you so pseudo your update.

33
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,110
That's why perfect.

34
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:47,600
And then we're going to install Ruby,

35
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:57,650
then going to curl and install file from the codedeploy ESRI bucket sources.

36
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:01,490
So let's have a look what we've got here.

37
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:03,840
I'm currently deploying this into Ireland,

38
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:11,240
so wherever your region is, you'll just replace that part of the girl.

39
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:15,130
So let's install this.

40
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:18,270
This check is there forces, right?

41
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:21,530
Let's make it executable.

42
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:27,250
But it on then we're going to run the installer.

43
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,080
How easy was that?

44
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,300
So now we've just installed the CODEDEPLOY agent.

45
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,140
Ah, how do we check that?

46
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:36,650
It's really and how do we start it on etcetera?

47
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:40,040
So let's have a look so you can use the service command

48
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:46,450
and check that it's running perfect, because you can also restart a cz.

49
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:50,440
Well, if we change out the status to start on our restart,

50
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:54,850
their you could just check That's running again.

51
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:56,640
Brilliant.

52
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,420
The next thing we're gonna do is we're gonna check the age and version.

53
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:07,150
So if we have a look at this file and we can it out,

54
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:09,290
you see what version is running a cult?

55
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:09,680
A place.

56
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:18,230
So we here we can see agent version official, they're perfect on.

57
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:21,300
We can also update that really easy as well.

58
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,420
We can audience stole the Asian.

59
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:28,140
We can literally just run this command.

60
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:32,160
I know no update itself.

61
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:32,890
And then that's checker.

62
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:36,740
That's running again.

63
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:41,000
Cool. How easy is that?
