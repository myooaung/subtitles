00:00:00.450  -->  00:00:07.110
Hello everyone and welcome to lecture on bar plot's bar plots are going to allow us to show a count

2

00:00:07.290  -->  00:00:12.090
when we're actually doing with categorical data instead of continuous data.

3

00:00:12.090  -->  00:00:16.710
Let's go ahead and jump to our studio and see how we can create these bar plots with cheesy plot too

4

00:00:16.710  -->  00:00:17.640
.

5

00:00:17.640  -->  00:00:23.220
All right so here I am in our studio and I've started out by saying library Jeez you plot two.

6

00:00:23.340  -->  00:00:29.710
And I went ahead and assigned DF MPG data frame that comes with G-G plus two.

7

00:00:29.820  -->  00:00:39.240
If we go ahead and take a look at MPG by saying head mpg here we'll see we have some manufactured data

8

00:00:39.270  -->  00:00:45.920
some model data some displacement and engine data year data cylinder etc..

9

00:00:45.930  -->  00:00:54.450
So let's go ahead and try to create a bar plot that categorizes the class of vehicle versus just the

10

00:00:54.450  -->  00:00:57.120
count of how many times it occurs.

11

00:00:57.120  -->  00:01:01.050
So for histogram we wanted continuous data on the x axis.

12

00:01:01.080  -->  00:01:03.180
In this case we have categorical data.

13

00:01:03.180  -->  00:01:09.690
So class is a great case of the categorical data which is a good fit for a bar plot instead of a histogram

14

00:01:09.710  -->  00:01:10.310
.

15

00:01:10.950  -->  00:01:13.560
So start off with First Data anaesthetics lair.

16

00:01:13.860  -->  00:01:22.540
When you go out and say P.L. and assign it Gigi plot I'll pass in our data which is DPF and then under

17

00:01:22.530  -->  00:01:23.220
statics.

18

00:01:23.250  -->  00:01:26.740
We'll go ahead and say X equals class.

19

00:01:26.760  -->  00:01:31.470
So again class is that categorical column in our data frame.

20

00:01:31.710  -->  00:01:38.190
And then for a bar plot for the geometry layer all you have to say is Jiya underscore bar.

21

00:01:38.580  -->  00:01:41.050
Let's go ahead and assign that.

22

00:01:41.100  -->  00:01:45.930
Actually this is going to print that out and see what we get.

23

00:01:46.590  -->  00:01:47.900
So if I run that source.

24

00:01:47.940  -->  00:01:50.170
Now we can see I'm going to zoom in on this.

25

00:01:50.180  -->  00:01:51.910
You can get a nice bar plot.

26

00:01:51.920  -->  00:01:57.270
So again the difference between a bar plot and a histogram on the y axis they're both showing eight

27

00:01:57.270  -->  00:01:57.860
counts.

28

00:01:57.870  -->  00:02:03.120
How many times that specific thing occurred there on the x axis for a bar plot.

29

00:02:03.120  -->  00:02:07.110
You're using categorical data instead of continuous data.

30

00:02:07.110  -->  00:02:13.080
So for the histogram we have a continuous data such as the weights of a car or the mpg of a car.

31

00:02:13.230  -->  00:02:20.670
And in this case we have class data which is going to be is it a two seater car a compact car or a mid-sized

32

00:02:20.670  -->  00:02:21.850
car etc..

33

00:02:22.110  -->  00:02:24.780
So that's the difference in a bar play and a histogram.

34

00:02:24.780  -->  00:02:30.090
And that's also denoted by the fact that there are spaces between each of these bars versus a histogram

35

00:02:30.090  -->  00:02:30.380
.

36

00:02:30.390  -->  00:02:33.640
You had no spaces and just continuous bends.

37

00:02:33.690  -->  00:02:34.180
All right.

38

00:02:34.380  -->  00:02:36.420
So that's the basics of a bar plot.

39

00:02:36.420  -->  00:02:43.800
Let's go ahead and keep adding onto the interesting thing we can do for bar plot is use the bar values

40

00:02:43.800  -->  00:02:46.200
to add a third level of data.

41

00:02:46.230  -->  00:02:54.660
So for instance we see here that we have a D R V or dry column in our data frame the drive column has

42

00:02:54.660  -->  00:02:55.770
three unique values.

43

00:02:55.770  -->  00:02:58.590
It has f r and the number 4.

44

00:02:58.740  -->  00:03:06.060
And what that means is is it a four wheel drive car a front wheel drive car or a rear wheel drive car

45

00:03:06.060  -->  00:03:06.650
.

46

00:03:06.720  -->  00:03:13.700
And what I can actually do is color these bars based off of the drive column.

47

00:03:13.740  -->  00:03:15.880
So let's go ahead and think about this.

48

00:03:15.900  -->  00:03:23.790
Usually if I'm just going to make a normal color for my plots or was it something like color blue run

49

00:03:23.790  -->  00:03:29.430
the source here and notice I get a blue outline it's a little hard to tell but I could say something

50

00:03:29.430  -->  00:03:36.630
like fill to fill these in as blue as well and then I get my blue bar plots.

51

00:03:36.900  -->  00:03:44.250
In this case I actually want to create this fill instead of creating the fill by some sort of just general

52

00:03:44.250  -->  00:03:44.930
term.

53

00:03:45.030  -->  00:03:48.420
I want to actually pass the fill as Diary of the column.

54

00:03:48.510  -->  00:03:55.260
So again when we're defining things like fill a color shape or size by another column in our data frame

55

00:03:55.620  -->  00:03:59.810
we end up doing is passing abs into our geometry call.

56

00:04:00.030  -->  00:04:07.020
In this case I'm going to go ahead and say Phil is equal to the RV column and this will kind of automatically

57

00:04:07.020  -->  00:04:09.660
create a stacked bar plot for us.

58

00:04:09.660  -->  00:04:11.440
So we're going to run this.

59

00:04:11.700  -->  00:04:12.420
And there we have it.

60

00:04:12.420  -->  00:04:17.720
So if we go in and zoom in on this we notice we have an auto stacked bar plot.

61

00:04:18.000  -->  00:04:24.330
And basically what this is showing is again we have the number of counts and the class of each car so

62

00:04:24.360  -->  00:04:31.100
different groups but by color we can determine the number of counts her drive type.

63

00:04:31.110  -->  00:04:38.760
So for instance two seater cars are all rear wheel drives versus pickup cars or all four wheel drive

64

00:04:38.910  -->  00:04:43.320
and that kind of makes sense your pickup trucks usually have four wheel drives and your two seater cars

65

00:04:43.350  -->  00:04:45.130
are usually rear wheel drives.

66

00:04:45.270  -->  00:04:51.330
And then we have a combination of other types of drives for the different cars with minivan being exclusively

67

00:04:51.330  -->  00:04:53.010
front wheel drive.

68

00:04:53.730  -->  00:04:54.600
OK.

69

00:04:55.020  -->  00:04:57.130
There's a special position argument.

70

00:04:57.180  -->  00:05:03.600
You can add with bar plots in order to show how we actually want to fill these sort of stacked bar plots

71

00:05:03.620  -->  00:05:04.210
.

72

00:05:04.830  -->  00:05:11.010
This argument goes outside this A-S but still inside the geometry layer and it's position.

73

00:05:11.010  -->  00:05:15.630
So it's a position adjustment in the bar plot setting.

74

00:05:16.230  -->  00:05:22.350
So I can say one of these terms is dodge and these are the kind of arguments they'll have to either

75

00:05:22.350  -->  00:05:27.470
reference the documentation by searching here and help for gambar.

76

00:05:27.480  -->  00:05:29.820
So if we did that it could say Geum bar.

77

00:05:29.820  -->  00:05:31.020
Click on it.

78

00:05:31.280  -->  00:05:36.120
It would take us to the documentation and it would tell us details about the kind of aesthetics we can

79

00:05:36.120  -->  00:05:38.490
add and some examples et cetera.

80

00:05:38.520  -->  00:05:40.300
So it's nice about all these geometry layers.

81

00:05:40.300  -->  00:05:45.040
They have tons of examples in the documentation or we can also reference that cheat sheet.

82

00:05:45.060  -->  00:05:48.850
I showed you earlier but in this case we have position equals dodge.

83

00:05:48.870  -->  00:05:53.650
And what's going to allow us to do if I go ahead and run this.

84

00:05:53.650  -->  00:05:55.700
It's going to show a different stacking.

85

00:05:55.860  -->  00:06:01.890
So if we zoom in on this it shows these different bars stacked side to side instead of straight on top

86

00:06:01.890  -->  00:06:02.670
of each other.

87

00:06:03.210  -->  00:06:08.820
And this makes it easier to compare within a certain group the number of drives to each other.

88

00:06:08.820  -->  00:06:16.380
So for instance this makes it easier to see that compact has about three times as many instances of

89

00:06:16.380  -->  00:06:19.860
front wheel drive versus four wheel drive.

90

00:06:20.070  -->  00:06:27.630
And this is just denoted by the height of the columns and the count measure on the y axis and that is

91

00:06:27.630  -->  00:06:31.240
known as position equals dodge.

92

00:06:31.470  -->  00:06:37.240
The other type of position argument we can choose for a bar plot is fill.

93

00:06:37.890  -->  00:06:42.360
And if we run that what that's going to change about our bar plot is that instead of actually showing

94

00:06:42.360  -->  00:06:47.820
the Count it will show the percentage of instances going to zoom on this.

95

00:06:47.970  -->  00:06:49.160
Notice that count.

96

00:06:49.170  -->  00:06:55.080
Now if you check it out goes from zero to 1 which is essentially just a percentage from 0 percent to

97

00:06:55.080  -->  00:06:56.050
100 percent.

98

00:06:56.310  -->  00:06:59.650
So we see that two seater is 100 percent.

99

00:06:59.820  -->  00:07:03.460
Rear wheel drive pickups are a 100 percent four wheel drives.

100

00:07:03.480  -->  00:07:07.770
We don't actually get the number count of instances of each of those drives.

101

00:07:07.770  -->  00:07:09.210
Just get a percentage.

102

00:07:09.210  -->  00:07:15.840
So this is a nice way to see percentages of each of these drive types which may be a little clearer

103

00:07:15.840  -->  00:07:21.570
than the actual stacked bar plots when we didn't pass position as an argument so to show that one more

104

00:07:21.570  -->  00:07:27.370
time I'll just go ahead and delete this position arguments run from the source.

105

00:07:27.690  -->  00:07:30.750
Now we can see here this was what the original looked like.

106

00:07:30.960  -->  00:07:35.130
So it's up to you to choose position really depends on what kind of story you're trying to tell or what

107

00:07:35.130  -->  00:07:39.470
kind of information you're trying to convey with your bar plot.

108

00:07:39.480  -->  00:07:40.200
All right.

109

00:07:40.200  -->  00:07:42.050
That's it for the basics of a bar plot.

110

00:07:42.060  -->  00:07:46.740
Hopefully you find this pretty easy now as far as just picking up a new geometry.

111

00:07:46.740  -->  00:07:52.470
They're learning a couple of special arguments and then implementing it as a new layer for data and

112

00:07:52.470  -->  00:07:53.940
aesthetics.

113

00:07:53.940  -->  00:07:54.750
All right.

114

00:07:54.750  -->  00:07:56.730
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture
