00:00:01.110  -->  00:00:06.000
Hello everyone and welcome to support vector machines project solutions lecture.

2

00:00:06.000  -->  00:00:11.830
In this first solution's lecture series we're going to be getting the data cleaning it and using some

3

00:00:11.830  -->  00:00:15.960
cheesy plot to libraries to perform exploratory data analysis.

4

00:00:15.960  -->  00:00:18.930
Let's go ahead and jump to our studio to get started.

5

00:00:18.930  -->  00:00:20.610
All right so here we are studio.

6

00:00:20.610  -->  00:00:25.500
Before you begin you should make sure you have the loan underscored data that cxxviii file in your working

7

00:00:25.500  -->  00:00:30.630
directory or know the whole path to the file We're going to go ahead and move that over to the right

8

00:00:31.860  -->  00:00:38.940
and first thing you had to do was use read that see a Sweet's open the file and again you can always

9

00:00:38.940  -->  00:00:40.770
use tab as a quick shortcut.

10

00:00:40.950  -->  00:00:45.390
Once you've started typing the first few letters of your file name then let's go ahead and check out

11

00:00:45.390  -->  00:00:47.280
the structure of loans

12

00:00:50.150  -->  00:00:52.620
run that we take a quick glance at.

13

00:00:52.620  -->  00:00:58.710
This looks like we have around 10000 observations of 14 variables and you can check out the notebook

14

00:00:59.100  -->  00:01:00.990
for each of these columns represent.

15

00:01:01.320  -->  00:01:07.290
But they're basically all just different factors that play into a customer's ability to pay back a loan

16

00:01:07.290  -->  00:01:08.500
.

17

00:01:08.550  -->  00:01:13.980
What we want to do next is look at the descriptions of the columns in The Notebook and convert the columns

18

00:01:14.220  -->  00:01:21.420
that should be categorical data into categorical data using factor and those columns are the following

19

00:01:21.420  -->  00:01:21.910
columns.

20

00:01:21.910  -->  00:01:26.940
I'm going to go ahead and copy this from the solutions notebook so we don't spend the whole lot of time

21

00:01:26.940  -->  00:01:30.040
just typing all of these out.

22

00:01:30.260  -->  00:01:34.740
We'll make a new section called convert to cut to Oracle

23

00:01:37.710  -->  00:01:40.370
and use factor in order to do that.

24

00:01:40.470  -->  00:01:43.650
The columns we had it is for was the credit policy column.

25

00:01:43.650  -->  00:01:50.700
The ink last six months column the delinquency over the past two years column the pub rech column and

26

00:01:50.700  -->  00:01:52.560
then the not fully paid column.

27

00:01:52.650  -->  00:01:58.020
Those were all integers when they really should have been factors other columns that are integers such

28

00:01:58.020  -->  00:01:59.320
as your FICO score.

29

00:01:59.370  -->  00:02:04.480
Those should stay as integers because it's a continuous value of your FICO score.

30

00:02:04.500  -->  00:02:12.420
Once you've done that we can go ahead and begin our exploratory data analysis or EDK are going to go

31

00:02:12.420  -->  00:02:14.140
ahead and run this source.

32

00:02:14.160  -->  00:02:17.040
So we have everything working like it should.

33

00:02:17.040  -->  00:02:21.670
I'm going to clear the cons. And begin by calling library.

34

00:02:21.700  -->  00:02:23.450
As you plot 2.

35

00:02:23.550  -->  00:02:27.870
And as always all the code and then typing out is available for you in the notebook.

36

00:02:27.930  -->  00:02:34.080
The first diagram I want you to do for exploratory data analysis was create a histogram of Fika scores

37

00:02:34.080  -->  00:02:37.010
colored by the not fully paid column.

38

00:02:37.020  -->  00:02:39.050
Let's go ahead and try to do that.

39

00:02:39.190  -->  00:02:46.780
I'm going to say P.L. are called G-G plot function pass in my loan's data frame.

40

00:02:47.220  -->  00:02:52.960
And since I'm doing a histogram I just need one x value and I want a histogram of the Fikile scores

41

00:02:52.990  -->  00:02:59.460
I'm going to pasan five go then I'm going to go ahead and add a new layer to this.

42

00:02:59.940  -->  00:03:03.160
The histogram layer or the geometry of the histogram layer.

43

00:03:03.690  -->  00:03:11.940
And I'm going to go ahead and specify that Phil should be by the not fully paid column.

44

00:03:14.130  -->  00:03:18.630
And I always like specifying the outline color as well.

45

00:03:18.630  -->  00:03:21.270
You don't have to do this totally up to you.

46

00:03:21.390  -->  00:03:27.080
We'll go ahead and specify bins equal to 40 and Alpha equal to zero point five.

47

00:03:27.100  -->  00:03:35.480
Now when we get a little bit of see through and then finally I'll add a theme to this.

48

00:03:35.550  -->  00:03:44.060
Let's go ahead and say P.L. plus theme underscore b w and let's show P.L..

49

00:03:44.640  -->  00:03:49.910
Let's go ahead and drag the plot when the over so we can see it fully.

50

00:03:49.920  -->  00:03:52.240
All right go ahead and click zoom here.

51

00:03:52.680  -->  00:03:54.750
We can see our histogram.

52

00:03:54.750  -->  00:04:00.980
One other thing I did and the solutions notebook was I changed the actual coloring.

53

00:04:00.990  -->  00:04:06.240
And the reason I changed the coloring was just intuitively I usually think of red as a negative or a

54

00:04:06.240  -->  00:04:09.820
bad thing and blue or green as a good thing.

55

00:04:09.870  -->  00:04:13.970
And since our column is not fully pay that means one is true.

56

00:04:13.980  -->  00:04:15.390
It was not fully paid.

57

00:04:15.420  -->  00:04:17.260
And right now that's in the cases as blue.

58

00:04:17.370  -->  00:04:20.910
Let's go ahead and show you how you could change the color for that.

59

00:04:20.910  -->  00:04:30.060
You can do that by just adding in this scale underscore Phil and we're going to do a manual fill because

60

00:04:30.060  -->  00:04:33.360
we wanted the scale since there's only two colors here.

61

00:04:33.360  -->  00:04:38.120
And then you just pass in an argument values and a vector of colors.

62

00:04:38.340  -->  00:04:42.150
I'm just going to go ahead and put in green and then red

63

00:04:46.270  -->  00:04:50.560
and now we have something that makes a little more sense as far as the color scheme to me at least personally

64

00:04:50.830  -->  00:04:54.560
totally up to you as far as what color scheme you want to use.

65

00:04:54.560  -->  00:05:00.040
Taking a quick look at this data we can see that as your FICO or basically your credit score goes higher

66

00:05:00.090  -->  00:05:00.450
.

67

00:05:00.460  -->  00:05:07.400
There's less likely hood that you're actually going to not fully pay your loan which makes sense as

68

00:05:07.390  -->  00:05:10.720
your FICO score gets higher your credit score gets higher.

69

00:05:10.750  -->  00:05:11.780
Many have better credit.

70

00:05:11.810  -->  00:05:15.090
And these people are probably more responsible as far as paying back their loans.

71

00:05:15.190  -->  00:05:20.650
And as your credit score starts to get lower you have a larger probability of actually not paying off

72

00:05:20.650  -->  00:05:21.640
your loan.

73

00:05:21.640  -->  00:05:26.360
And when I say probability I just mean looking at the actual historical counts.

74

00:05:27.190  -->  00:05:33.490
Let's go ahead and move on by creating a bar plot of the purpose counts again colored by not fully paid

75

00:05:33.790  -->  00:05:34.030
.

76

00:05:34.190  -->  00:05:36.940
To go ahead and squeeze us over to the right.

77

00:05:37.030  -->  00:05:45.130
I will clear the council and reassign people to G-G plots and loans.

78

00:05:45.560  -->  00:05:52.270
And I want the aesthetic to be my X which is the factor of purpose and where using factor because this

79

00:05:52.270  -->  00:05:59.720
is a bar plot and I'm going to go ahead and add a geometry level to that.

80

00:05:59.770  -->  00:06:05.480
Geometers square bar and I want to color this again by the not fully paid column

81

00:06:09.740  -->  00:06:14.450
and it was indicated in the note book they should set position equal to dodge.

82

00:06:15.130  -->  00:06:19.600
That's technically optional but I believe the diagram is a little more readable when you put that position

83

00:06:19.610  -->  00:06:19.640
.

84

00:06:19.630  -->  00:06:24.490
Dodge which just basically puts the bars on right next to each other instead of stacked on top of each

85

00:06:24.500  -->  00:06:25.420
other.

86

00:06:25.740  -->  00:06:38.910
And then finally let's go ahead and add a theme to this and plot it out.

87

00:06:39.120  -->  00:06:46.630
If we go in and click zoom here now we can see again the purpose or the factor of purpose versus the

88

00:06:46.630  -->  00:06:50.350
count of people who did not fully pay versus fully paid.

89

00:06:50.360  -->  00:06:52.740
This is kind of interesting to look at.

90

00:06:52.960  -->  00:06:57.970
We can see right off the bat that that consolidation is by far the most popular reason people are actually

91

00:06:57.980  -->  00:07:00.550
taking out these loans.

92

00:07:00.550  -->  00:07:04.820
Also it looks like credit card which is also pretty similar to debt.

93

00:07:04.880  -->  00:07:10.540
And then there's all other reasons it's another large reason for people actually taking out these loans

94

00:07:10.540  -->  00:07:11.550
.

95

00:07:11.560  -->  00:07:17.710
Let's go ahead and move along with our exploratory data analysis and create a scatterplot of Psycho

96

00:07:17.710  -->  00:07:20.330
score versus the interest rates.

97

00:07:20.870  -->  00:07:25.920
And hopefully we can see a trend that makes sense.

98

00:07:26.240  -->  00:07:33.550
I'm going to go ahead and say people Geez you plot us in my loans data and I want the aesthetic.

99

00:07:33.550  -->  00:07:39.790
Now I'm going to need an x and y since I'm doing it scatterplot I'll put interest rate on the x axis

100

00:07:39.940  -->  00:07:48.280
and FICO score on the y axis and then I'm going to ask for geometer score points and I'll add a theme

101

00:07:48.280  -->  00:07:48.880
to this

102

00:07:51.940  -->  00:07:59.280
and then let's show the basic scatterplot moving this over and click and zoom.

103

00:07:59.360  -->  00:08:03.790
This is our most basic scatterplot of Fikile versus your interest rate.

104

00:08:03.790  -->  00:08:06.520
The note book asks Does this trend make sense.

105

00:08:06.550  -->  00:08:13.640
If you look at the general trend this it looks like it starts to go down in final score as the interest

106

00:08:13.630  -->  00:08:14.840
rate gets higher.

107

00:08:14.840  -->  00:08:20.380
A better way of actually phrasing that is your interest rate comes up as your FICO score lowers and

108

00:08:20.380  -->  00:08:26.290
that makes sense because as your credit score goes lower you'll probably be having to pay a higher interest

109

00:08:26.290  -->  00:08:28.390
rate on those loans.

110

00:08:28.390  -->  00:08:33.470
Now you could have kept playing around trying to color this data a little more so that it's just giving

111

00:08:33.460  -->  00:08:39.140
you more information visually something you may have wanted to do is actually color this by not fully

112

00:08:39.130  -->  00:08:41.680
paid versus fully paid.

113

00:08:41.690  -->  00:08:45.250
We can go ahead and do that fight push up here.

114

00:08:45.250  -->  00:08:54.530
I can say and GM underscore points put an aesthetic for color and then pass in the column not fully

115

00:08:54.520  -->  00:08:56.340
paid.

116

00:08:57.230  -->  00:09:03.440
And then we can also put in an alpha value so that we can see points stacked on top of each other a

117

00:09:03.430  -->  00:09:04.940
little more clearly.

118

00:09:05.360  -->  00:09:12.970
And let's show that new people for click zoom here that look something like this might be a little debatable

119

00:09:12.970  -->  00:09:15.810
if this is more readable or give me more information.

120

00:09:15.830  -->  00:09:18.380
But it's just something to explore.

121

00:09:18.380  -->  00:09:23.070
That's it for the exploratory data analysis section of this project.

122

00:09:23.260  -->  00:09:28.520
Let's go ahead and quickly review what we did before we move on to part 2 which is the actual training

123

00:09:28.580  -->  00:09:32.380
and building of the model.

124

00:09:32.380  -->  00:09:38.650
All we have to do in this case was read the C S V file and checking out the description of the columns

125

00:09:38.650  -->  00:09:44.160
we converted some of the columns to categorical columns such as a credit policy column the Dilling would

126

00:09:44.150  -->  00:09:49.150
see in the past few years column that fully paid column etc. and we could do that just by resetting

127

00:09:49.150  -->  00:09:52.930
the column to the factor version of the column.

128

00:09:53.120  -->  00:09:59.350
Then we went ahead and explored some plots for data through G.D. plot to an exploratory data analysis

129

00:09:59.360  -->  00:10:00.080
.

130

00:10:00.080  -->  00:10:06.070
We went ahead and check that your FICO score gets lower your interest rate is going to get higher than

131

00:10:06.080  -->  00:10:13.370
we did a bar plot of the purpose of taking out the loans versus the actual count looks like that consolidation

132

00:10:13.370  -->  00:10:17.960
and credit card are the most popular reasons for actually taking out a loan and things such as your

133

00:10:17.950  -->  00:10:24.130
small business major purchases home improvement in education don't have as many people actually taking

134

00:10:24.130  -->  00:10:28.060
out the loans for that reason without purpose.

135

00:10:28.150  -->  00:10:33.000
And then we went ahead and just checked out a general accounts of the histogram of fikir scores and

136

00:10:33.010  -->  00:10:38.150
we also were able to gather more information from this visualization by colouring it by they not fully

137

00:10:38.140  -->  00:10:39.360
paid column.

138

00:10:39.380  -->  00:10:45.160
And here it's quite clear again that as your FICO score goes higher you are more likely to find someone

139

00:10:45.160  -->  00:10:50.270
that did fully pay off their loan versus as your FICO score gets lower.

140

00:10:50.290  -->  00:10:54.060
There is more occurrences of people not fully paying off their loan.

141

00:10:54.190  -->  00:10:56.310
All right that's it for this lecture.

142

00:10:56.330  -->  00:11:01.640
I will see you at part two or we will actually begin to build a support vector machine a model.

143

00:11:01.660  -->  00:11:02.430
Thanks everyone.

144

00:11:02.420  -->  00:11:03.400
And it next lecture
