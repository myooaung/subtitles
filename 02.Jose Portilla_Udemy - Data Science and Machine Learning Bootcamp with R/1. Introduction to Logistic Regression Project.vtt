00:00:00.750  -->  00:00:05.400
Hello everyone and welcome to the logistic regression project and this lecture I'm going to be giving

2

00:00:05.400  -->  00:00:09.690
a brief overview of the project notebook and how to approach the project.

3

00:00:09.690  -->  00:00:12.210
Let's go ahead and jump to the notebook for the project.

4

00:00:12.550  -->  00:00:14.670
OK so here we are at the project notebook.

5

00:00:14.670  -->  00:00:20.640
In this project we're going to be working with the UCI adult data sets and this is a data set of a bunch

6

00:00:20.640  -->  00:00:25.740
of features of adults and we'll be attempting to predict if people in the dataset belong in a certain

7

00:00:25.740  -->  00:00:27.570
class by salary.

8

00:00:27.660  -->  00:00:32.820
That means we're going to do a binary classification using logistic regression trying to predict whether

9

00:00:32.820  -->  00:00:37.810
someone makes less than 50 thousand year or more than 50000 dollars a year.

10

00:00:38.160  -->  00:00:43.140
You're going to go ahead and get the data checked the head of the adult data set and continue on with

11

00:00:43.140  -->  00:00:49.500
some data cleaning and exploratory data analysis since typically most of your time is spent cleaning

12

00:00:49.500  -->  00:00:53.390
data and not just running the few lines of the logistic regression code.

13

00:00:53.580  -->  00:00:58.020
Well we're going to do is try to show you different issues that may arise when you're cleaning your

14

00:00:58.020  -->  00:00:58.720
data.

15

00:00:58.770  -->  00:01:04.440
That means the focus of this project is going to be data cleaning and it will go ahead do a lot of different

16

00:01:04.590  -->  00:01:10.170
aspects of data cleaning will do a little bit of exploratory data analysis you create some missing features

17

00:01:10.230  -->  00:01:11.280
or figures.

18

00:01:11.520  -->  00:01:16.000
Then you'll also do a little bit of G-G plot visualization for exploratory data analysis.

19

00:01:16.080  -->  00:01:21.030
Then finally you'll go ahead and build the model with logistic regression and do a train test split

20

00:01:21.240  -->  00:01:23.910
and try to predict off of your model.

21

00:01:23.910  -->  00:01:27.510
With that being said go ahead and get started on the project.

22

00:01:27.510  -->  00:01:28.200
Best of luck.

23

00:01:28.200  -->  00:01:30.810
Feel free to reference the solution notebook as we need it.

24

00:01:30.960  -->  00:01:34.670
But just go ahead and go to the notebook and follow along the instructions.

25

00:01:34.680  -->  00:01:39.170
Thanks everyone and I'll see at the next lecture which is the solutions walk through for this project
