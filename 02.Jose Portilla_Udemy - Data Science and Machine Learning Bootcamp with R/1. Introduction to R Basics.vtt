00:00:05.850  -->  00:00:10.040
Hello everyone and welcome to the introduction to our basics section of this course.

2

00:00:10.080  -->  00:00:14.820
By now you should have your environment fully set up understand what this course is about and get ready

3

00:00:14.820  -->  00:00:18.210
to tackle the rest of the curriculum of the course in the introductions.

4

00:00:18.210  -->  00:00:21.770
Our basic section will start off with the very beginning of what you should know.

5

00:00:21.780  -->  00:00:26.660
Things like arithmetic and are how to create a variable in our and then go over our basic data types

6

00:00:26.660  -->  00:00:33.420
such as vectors lists matrices data frames etc. to start off with the introduction to our basic section

7

00:00:33.420  -->  00:00:33.690
.

8

00:00:33.720  -->  00:00:39.820
I want to show you how next four sections of the Course are built into the notes for this course.

9

00:00:39.870  -->  00:00:45.060
Again if you want the notes go ahead and review the lecture called course notes which has a basic overview

10

00:00:45.060  -->  00:00:46.950
of the notes and how to download them.

11

00:00:46.950  -->  00:00:50.310
Right now I'm going to go ahead and jump to those notes myself.

12

00:00:50.310  -->  00:00:50.930
Let me go ahead.

13

00:00:50.940  -->  00:00:53.700
Open those files in another window.

14

00:00:53.700  -->  00:00:54.000
All right.

15

00:00:54.000  -->  00:01:00.070
Here I am at the course notes for the next few couple of sections Sections 4 5 6 and 7.

16

00:01:00.300  -->  00:01:05.490
All the notes that you're going to need are available either in the basics of R and data types or if

17

00:01:05.490  -->  00:01:07.500
you're actually performing a training exercise.

18

00:01:07.600  -->  00:01:12.300
You'll be under the training exercises folder her now may go in and should the basics of our and data

19

00:01:12.300  -->  00:01:17.310
types go to this folder and we're going to start off with just our basic section.

20

00:01:17.610  -->  00:01:21.180
Meaning these are the actual notebooks corresponding to each lecture.

21

00:01:21.180  -->  00:01:25.530
You can go in and double click them open them up in your browser and explore the code A corresponds

22

00:01:25.530  -->  00:01:26.580
to lecture.

23

00:01:26.580  -->  00:01:31.590
Basically what I'm going to be doing is explaining and coding out live for you in video.

24

00:01:31.650  -->  00:01:34.810
All the notes that are in these notebook files.

25

00:01:35.070  -->  00:01:40.050
If you go ahead and go back to the basics of our types you'll notice there's matrices lists and data

26

00:01:40.050  -->  00:01:40.770
frames.

27

00:01:40.830  -->  00:01:46.110
These are the next subsequent sections that are also all fall under the basics of R and data types folder

28

00:01:46.120  -->  00:01:47.000
.

29

00:01:47.850  -->  00:01:53.640
So here's the code for our base or our data frame's code for the Arliss SpaceX lecture and then code

30

00:01:53.640  -->  00:01:55.280
for the matrices lecture.

31

00:01:55.320  -->  00:02:00.630
If you actually get to a training exercise section in the next couple of sections go to the training

32

00:02:00.630  -->  00:02:02.100
exercises folder.

33

00:02:02.100  -->  00:02:07.640
Double click on it click on exercises and then find the appropriate exercise.

34

00:02:07.670  -->  00:02:13.380
It'll match the title of the lecture and if you want the solution to that exercise then check out the

35

00:02:13.380  -->  00:02:15.530
solutions folder.

36

00:02:15.570  -->  00:02:17.870
All right that's all you need to know to continue.

37

00:02:17.910  -->  00:02:22.950
If you have any questions feel free to post the Q&A section of the course in me or the other students

38

00:02:22.950  -->  00:02:24.960
will be happy to answer them for you.

39

00:02:24.960  -->  00:02:27.100
Thanks everyone and I'll see at the next lecture.
