Hello everyone and welcome to the our matrix exercises lecture.

2

00:00:10.150  -->  00:00:15.420
Now to truly learn all about matrices how to perform matrix operations in our let's go ahead and test

3

00:00:15.420  -->  00:00:17.880
your knowledge through a training exercise.

4

00:00:17.880  -->  00:00:22.830
In this video I'm just going to go ahead and do a brief overview of the matrix training exercise.

5

00:00:22.830  -->  00:00:25.220
Let's go ahead and jump to the notebook.

6

00:00:25.260  -->  00:00:25.530
All right.

7

00:00:25.530  -->  00:00:26.970
Here we are at the notebook.

8

00:00:26.970  -->  00:00:32.520
This is the R matrix exercises notebook and all you have to do for this training exercise is just complete

9

00:00:32.940  -->  00:00:39.730
the bulled instructions labeled exercises 1 all the way down to exercise Eight Below.

10

00:00:39.790  -->  00:00:43.990
There's examples of what the results should look like and then just go ahead and type out your code

11

00:00:43.990  -->  00:00:48.660
and our studio to try to match the results here in case you ever need the solutions.

12

00:00:48.660  -->  00:00:53.550
You can check out the solutions book or the next video lecture or actually walk through and explain

13

00:00:53.550  -->  00:00:55.860
the solutions for the exercises.

14

00:00:55.860  -->  00:00:56.790
Thanks everyone.

15

00:00:56.790  -->  00:00:58.800
Best of luck and I'll see you at the next lecture
