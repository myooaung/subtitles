00:00:05.670  -->  00:00:11.580
Hello everyone and welcome to the lecture discussion on what is data science and this lecture will briefly

2

00:00:11.580  -->  00:00:17.610
be discussing three main topics we'll talk about the growing interest in data science is a field.

3

00:00:17.610  -->  00:00:23.100
The growing demand for data scientists in the job market as well as an overview definition of what is

4

00:00:23.100  -->  00:00:25.290
data science.

5

00:00:25.370  -->  00:00:30.930
A simple Google Trends search for the term data scientist reveals a recent explosion in popularity for

6

00:00:30.930  -->  00:00:33.710
people searching for the term data scientist.

7

00:00:33.720  -->  00:00:37.650
This is because data science can affect so many fields and domains.

8

00:00:37.650  -->  00:00:42.180
You may already be familiar of domains that work closely if data science such as machine translation

9

00:00:42.330  -->  00:00:45.970
speech recognition robotics search engines etc..

10

00:00:46.080  -->  00:00:52.980
However they do science can affect other fields such as biology health care humanities finance Medical

11

00:00:52.980  -->  00:00:59.010
Informatics business economics and so much more because data science is applicable to so many fields

12

00:00:59.010  -->  00:00:59.920
of study.

13

00:00:59.970  -->  00:01:05.310
The explosion of popularity and the ability to use data science has grown just in the past few years

14

00:01:05.450  -->  00:01:06.520
tremendously.

15

00:01:06.810  -->  00:01:12.450
Searching for job trends on indeed dotcom also reveals Eytan exploding demand for data scientists in

16

00:01:12.450  -->  00:01:13.640
the job market.

17

00:01:13.890  -->  00:01:20.190
Over the past four years there's been a 1600 percent growth in job postings for the term data scientist

18

00:01:20.190  -->  00:01:20.510
.

19

00:01:20.610  -->  00:01:25.920
In fact data scientists has been called the sexiest job of the 21st century by the Harvard Business

20

00:01:25.920  -->  00:01:33.450
Review McKinsey and Company project a global excess demand of 1.5 million new data scientists needed

21

00:01:33.450  -->  00:01:33.980
.

22

00:01:34.050  -->  00:01:37.420
This is going to lead to a huge skills gap that you can fill.

23

00:01:37.470  -->  00:01:42.900
Allowing data scientists the man very generous compensations for their new skill sets.

24

00:01:43.500  -->  00:01:48.720
The explosion of the popularity of data science can be attributed to many factors but there's four main

25

00:01:48.720  -->  00:01:50.220
driving factors.

26

00:01:50.220  -->  00:01:54.120
One is that there's more data being created than ever before.

27

00:01:54.210  -->  00:01:58.860
The second being large computing power is easily available.

28

00:01:58.860  -->  00:02:04.230
Things such as Amazon Web Services and Google's cloud computing platform have allowed us to have large

29

00:02:04.230  -->  00:02:06.870
computing power at our fingertips.

30

00:02:07.080  -->  00:02:12.870
The third being new programming tools tools such as the our programming language to help you quickly

31

00:02:12.960  -->  00:02:16.650
analyze data and perform statistical analysis on it.

32

00:02:16.650  -->  00:02:22.770
And finally this huge skills demand has led to generous compensation for data scientists meaning more

33

00:02:22.770  -->  00:02:28.500
and more people are willing to jump into the new field will learn a lot and demand those higher salaries

34

00:02:28.500  -->  00:02:30.270
.

35

00:02:30.270  -->  00:02:36.570
Now let's talk about a definition of data science we can think of data science as an intersection of

36

00:02:36.570  -->  00:02:42.960
fields the intersection of computer science math and statistics knowledge and then general domain knowledge

37

00:02:42.960  -->  00:02:43.280
.

38

00:02:43.320  -->  00:02:46.690
We can look at the intersection of just two of these fields.

39

00:02:46.830  -->  00:02:52.440
For instance the intersection of computer science and math and statistics leads the field of machine

40

00:02:52.440  -->  00:02:53.510
learning.

41

00:02:53.520  -->  00:02:58.230
You should note that machine learning is not the same thing as data science instead of machine learning

42

00:02:58.290  -->  00:03:01.170
is part of data science.

43

00:03:01.170  -->  00:03:06.090
If we were to cross computer science and general domain knowledge of a specific field you would get

44

00:03:06.090  -->  00:03:12.390
software development meaning use using computer science knowledge develop software very specific domain

45

00:03:13.130  -->  00:03:18.270
and then if you combine math and statistics with domain knowledge you'll get classic research such as

46

00:03:18.270  -->  00:03:21.580
research performed in social sciences in academia.

47

00:03:21.750  -->  00:03:27.270
It's the intersection of all three of these topics where you get data science as an outcome in this

48

00:03:27.270  -->  00:03:27.750
course.

49

00:03:27.770  -->  00:03:31.790
You'll learn how to use computer science programming with the R programming language.

50

00:03:31.950  -->  00:03:37.710
The math and statistical analysis available in our programming language and apply it to various domains

51

00:03:37.710  -->  00:03:42.650
of study in order to fully understand the full data science lifecycle.

52

00:03:43.010  -->  00:03:47.490
All right let's start learning all these new skills with the rest of the course.

53

00:03:47.490  -->  00:03:49.470
Thanks everyone and I'll see at the next lecture
