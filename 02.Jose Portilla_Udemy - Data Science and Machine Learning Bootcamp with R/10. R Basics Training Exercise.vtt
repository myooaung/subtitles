00:00:06.390  -->  00:00:10.370
Well everyone and welcome to the our basics training exercise lecture.

2

00:00:10.460  -->  00:00:12.350
So your first training exercise.

3

00:00:12.390  -->  00:00:16.710
I want to just take the time in this lecture to show you how to access the training exercise how to

4

00:00:16.710  -->  00:00:19.010
approach it and what's coming up next.

5

00:00:19.020  -->  00:00:22.150
Let's go ahead and jump to the course notes.

6

00:00:22.260  -->  00:00:22.580
All right.

7

00:00:22.580  -->  00:00:28.470
Here I am at the course notes in order to access the basics training exercise or any training exercise

8

00:00:28.580  -->  00:00:29.980
in the upcoming section.

9

00:00:30.000  -->  00:00:36.660
Just go ahead and double click on the training exercise folder then click on exercises and you should

10

00:00:36.660  -->  00:00:38.820
see the basics exercise.

11

00:00:38.970  -->  00:00:46.020
Once you've completed that exercise you can go back to exercise solutions and reference the solutions

12

00:00:46.020  -->  00:00:47.480
lecture.

13

00:00:47.580  -->  00:00:51.690
Let's go ahead and show you what the actual exercise notebook looks like.

14

00:00:51.690  -->  00:00:57.450
All you have do is double click on this HTL file called our basics exercise and you should have it set

15

00:00:57.450  -->  00:01:02.780
up so that your browser preferably chrome opens it up and this is what it looks like.

16

00:01:02.780  -->  00:01:08.040
All you have to do is then read through the instructions and answer the following problems using our

17

00:01:08.040  -->  00:01:08.770
.

18

00:01:08.820  -->  00:01:12.570
For example the very first question is what is tudes the power of 5.

19

00:01:12.570  -->  00:01:18.350
Now the point of that type of question is asking you Do you remember how to do exponents in R.

20

00:01:18.360  -->  00:01:22.420
You'll go ahead and open up our studio and just answer the questions.

21

00:01:22.530  -->  00:01:26.430
Create a vector called stock prices with these following data points etc..

22

00:01:26.700  -->  00:01:33.630
Don't worry if the output of this particular notebook doesn't match at least formatting wise the output

23

00:01:33.630  -->  00:01:36.240
of our studio they're going to be a slightly different.

24

00:01:36.240  -->  00:01:42.600
For example this vector output is shown vertical instead of horizontal but that's not a big deal.

25

00:01:42.630  -->  00:01:47.970
Only thing that needs to match up is the actual answers not the actual format.

26

00:01:47.970  -->  00:01:52.140
This exercise should be pretty basic because you haven't learned a whole lot about our.

27

00:01:52.170  -->  00:01:57.050
I just want you to feel comfortable going through a training exercise and answering some questions.

28

00:01:57.090  -->  00:01:57.690
All right.

29

00:01:57.750  -->  00:01:59.840
Best of luck on a training exercise.

30

00:01:59.850  -->  00:02:03.700
Coming up next is a video where I walk through the solutions for the exercise.

31

00:02:03.840  -->  00:02:07.890
And again you can always reference the solution exercise notebook on your own.

32

00:02:07.950  -->  00:02:10.440
In case you just want to quickly check your own answers.

33

00:02:10.440  -->  00:02:12.900
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
