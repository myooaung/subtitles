00:00:00,510  -->  00:00:05,560
Hello everyone and welcome to the lecture on to variable plotting with cheesy plot too.

2

00:00:05,910  -->  00:00:10,640
And this lecture will show some examples of how you can compare two variables from the same dataset

3

00:00:10,680  -->  00:00:11,320
.

4

00:00:11,340  -->  00:00:14,170
Let's go ahead and jump to our studio and see how this is done.

5

00:00:14,520  -->  00:00:19,900
OK so here we are our studio and the first thing I want to do is go ahead and call library Geez you

6

00:00:19,920  -->  00:00:25,920
plot too and also call library to bring up the movie status that we were talking about earlier.

7

00:00:26,030  -->  00:00:32,730
Cheesy plot two movies and let's go ahead and show you a couple of examples of how we can do two variable

8

00:00:32,730  -->  00:00:35,150
Claudian with G.G. plot two.

9

00:00:35,160  -->  00:00:38,340
First we'll go ahead and start off with our data layer.

10

00:00:38,460  -->  00:00:44,870
So say G-G plot pass in movies since that's going to be the data set we're working with for data frame

11

00:00:44,870  -->  00:00:51,930
are working with and then we'll have an Ã¦sthetics layer inside of that G-G plot call will say x is equal

12

00:00:51,930  -->  00:00:56,400
to year and Y is equal to the rating column.

13

00:00:56,400  -->  00:01:03,690
Let's go ahead and save that as a variable P L and then the geometry you're going to first explore is

14

00:01:03,690  -->  00:01:06,140
the two d been chart.

15

00:01:06,490  -->  00:01:11,490
So the to the bench or is g underscore been to D.

16

00:01:11,550  -->  00:01:14,540
Let's go ahead and just check out what this looks like on its own.

17

00:01:14,580  -->  00:01:16,350
So we'll go ahead and print out

18

00:01:19,560  -->  00:01:21,880
this to the chart.

19

00:01:23,500  -->  00:01:30,420
OK so taking a look at this plot we have a 2D bencher and basically what this means is we have two variables

20

00:01:30,720  -->  00:01:35,260
on the x axis we have year in on the y axis we have rating.

21

00:01:35,460  -->  00:01:41,790
And then this is almost serving as a bit of a heat map where the color indicates high or low counts

22

00:01:42,180  -->  00:01:44,270
of ratings.

23

00:01:44,460  -->  00:01:49,920
So that means not the actual rating value but the number of occurrences.

24

00:01:49,920  -->  00:01:58,740
So the general trend we can see here is that there were lots of ratings between 5.0 and 7.00 in the

25

00:01:58,740  -->  00:02:07,030
later years around what say 1990 or year 2000 ish whatever you can see this hotspot.

26

00:02:07,860  -->  00:02:13,410
If we wanted to go ahead and change this color from the default Blues what we can go ahead and do is

27

00:02:13,470  -->  00:02:16,860
add a scale field gradient argument to this.

28

00:02:16,860  -->  00:02:18,980
So let's go in and do that.

29

00:02:19,440  -->  00:02:22,880
We'll go ahead and call this Piel 2.

30

00:02:23,730  -->  00:02:36,460
And after Geum underscore beento will say scale fill gradients and then for the scale fill gradient

31

00:02:36,480  -->  00:02:46,050
what we can do is add high and low values so we can say high is equal to red although and say low is

32

00:02:46,050  -->  00:02:48,830
equal to what you see green.

33

00:02:48,900  -->  00:02:54,330
You can go ahead and choose that are values you want and let's make sure the prince sees our balance

34

00:02:54,330  -->  00:02:54,460
.

35

00:02:54,460  -->  00:02:56,290
This is getting a little unwieldy.

36

00:02:56,370  -->  00:02:59,870
We'll go ahead and say this is pilt too.

37

00:02:59,880  -->  00:03:07,160
So we assign this data set x and geometry it's appeal to and then we say Piel 2 plus this scale Phil.

38

00:03:08,250  -->  00:03:13,500
I'll go ahead and then print this out.

39

00:03:13,980  -->  00:03:15,090
So I'm printing that out.

40

00:03:15,100  -->  00:03:20,760
We can go ahead and see probably in a much clearer picture where those high count values are for particular

41

00:03:20,760  -->  00:03:22,050
ratings.

42

00:03:22,050  -->  00:03:30,180
So that's the way you can affect the scale fill gradient of your to the bin charts and you can also

43

00:03:30,180  -->  00:03:37,890
control the bin sizes in a GM underscore beento geometry or to the benchmark type which you can go ahead

44

00:03:37,890  -->  00:03:44,700
and do is pasan a been with arguments and that accepts a vector.

45

00:03:44,700  -->  00:03:48,990
So they use a combined function c and to show you an example.

46

00:03:49,000  -->  00:03:52,620
Go ahead and pass in 3:01 as a vector.

47

00:03:52,890  -->  00:03:57,210
And notice we end up getting a different ratio or different Ben size.

48

00:03:57,210  -->  00:04:02,930
Here let me go in and make this sort of green will say blue.

49

00:04:02,970  -->  00:04:04,710
So it's a little easier to see.

50

00:04:04,730  -->  00:04:13,110
Hopefully as far as a change in size but that was due to the been with argument that we just added to

51

00:04:13,170  -->  00:04:19,110
that geometry layer by default the been with are just one one.

52

00:04:19,230  -->  00:04:24,690
So you can mess around and play with that in case you want to affect the bin sizes in case you don't

53

00:04:24,690  -->  00:04:27,690
want just to the band with rectangular bins.

54

00:04:27,900  -->  00:04:36,150
But you can end up doing is a hex plot which is really similar to this to the plot except it uses hexagons

55

00:04:36,210  -->  00:04:38,040
instead of just rectangles.

56

00:04:38,340  -->  00:04:45,660
So sort of saying in this geometry layer GM underscore been to the what you're saying is Jiya underscore

57

00:04:46,110  -->  00:04:52,230
X and we can go ahead to leave everything else the same.

58

00:04:52,230  -->  00:04:59,550
And if you get this error package hecks been required for stat then hex which you'll need to do is install

59

00:04:59,550  -->  00:05:01,470
hex been as a package.

60

00:05:01,470  -->  00:05:03,640
So I'm going to go ahead and show you how to do that.

61

00:05:03,840  -->  00:05:13,220
You'll need a say install packages and pass in x been in quotes then it will install a package.

62

00:05:13,230  -->  00:05:14,500
Download it for you.

63

00:05:14,750  -->  00:05:20,170
And now you should be able to apply this Jiya underscore hex for some installations of our.

64

00:05:20,280  -->  00:05:25,110
This will automatically be installed for you see may not need to do this line but I'll go ahead and

65

00:05:25,110  -->  00:05:26,770
just copy and paste it here.

66

00:05:27,030  -->  00:05:28,740
In case you need a reference later.

67

00:05:28,740  -->  00:05:34,980
So again you may need to say install the packages hex men for line number seven in this case.

68

00:05:34,980  -->  00:05:37,370
Actually call this geometer Estcourt hex.

69

00:05:37,440  -->  00:05:41,880
Let me go ahead and clear the console and run this again.

70

00:05:41,910  -->  00:05:44,630
And now we have a nice hex spend plot.

71

00:05:44,650  -->  00:05:49,130
So if we go ahead and zoom in on this we can see the shapes of the hex bin.

72

00:05:49,150  -->  00:05:57,120
Sometimes it may get messed up on this zoom in but usually that clears up when you actually export it

73

00:05:57,120  -->  00:05:58,660
to an image or PDA.

74

00:05:58,680  -->  00:06:00,120
So just keep that in mind.

75

00:06:00,120  -->  00:06:04,950
Sometimes the graphics won't display the same in our studio as they will when you export it.

76

00:06:05,070  -->  00:06:09,490
Just because there may be too many hexagons for it to properly display.

77

00:06:09,720  -->  00:06:13,800
Finally the last to the variable plot.

78

00:06:13,800  -->  00:06:16,600
I want to show you is the GM density to the.

79

00:06:16,620  -->  00:06:19,360
Which is just to the density plot.

80

00:06:19,860  -->  00:06:23,440
So that command if we go ahead and just show that basic one.

81

00:06:23,460  -->  00:06:33,540
I'll go ahead and get rid of the scale filt gradients will so Geum underscore density to the let's go

82

00:06:33,540  -->  00:06:34,710
ahead and run that

83

00:06:37,620  -->  00:06:39,770
and you'll get an output that looks something like this.

84

00:06:39,770  -->  00:06:45,990
If you go ahead and zoom in on it you can see that this is just a to the density plot with year on the

85

00:06:45,990  -->  00:06:50,850
x axis and rating on the y axis so it's coherent close.

86

00:06:51,020  -->  00:06:57,820
This zoom and that's really all there is to to the variable plotting.

87

00:06:57,870  -->  00:07:03,360
If you're interested in some more options as far as plotting two variables against each other you can

88

00:07:03,360  -->  00:07:07,800
go ahead and check out the cheat sheet we mentioned earlier in the section of the course so it didn't

89

00:07:07,800  -->  00:07:09,110
jump too quickly now.

90

00:07:09,420  -->  00:07:13,750
And here we are at this cheat sheet so you can check out again two variables.

91

00:07:13,920  -->  00:07:18,390
If they're continuous by various distributions these are essentially the ones we just showed right now

92

00:07:18,440  -->  00:07:18,510
.

93

00:07:18,540  -->  00:07:22,860
If we go in and zoom in go to the right.

94

00:07:22,860  -->  00:07:27,180
These are the different types of plots you can use for two variables and we essentially just showed

95

00:07:27,840  -->  00:07:33,270
that to the bin plots the to the density plots and the hexagon plots.

96

00:07:33,330  -->  00:07:36,140
All right so that's it for this lecture.

97

00:07:36,390  -->  00:07:42,570
Hopefully by now you feel comfortable using the different layers and going to this cheat sheet and seeing

98

00:07:42,570  -->  00:07:44,250
what options you have.

99

00:07:44,250  -->  00:07:46,380
All right that's it for this lecture.

100

00:07:46,380  -->  00:07:47,930
Thanks I'll see you at the next one.
