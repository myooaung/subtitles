00:00:00,990  -->  00:00:04,510
Hello everyone and welcome to the Arithmetike with our lecturer.

2

00:00:04,630  -->  00:00:10,050
It's going to be a relatively short lecture just showing how to do basic mathematics with our let's

3

00:00:10,050  -->  00:00:13,190
go ahead and jump to our studio.

4

00:00:13,200  -->  00:00:18,200
All right so here we are our studio and we're going to be just doing really basic math.

5

00:00:18,240  -->  00:00:22,380
We're just going to be using the console so don't worry about writing in our script for this unless

6

00:00:22,410  -->  00:00:24,830
you want to keep a history of what we've done.

7

00:00:24,910  -->  00:00:28,090
So go ahead and push the con. ups we can see it.

8

00:00:28,320  -->  00:00:33,800
And let me go ahead and just show you how to do some basic arithmetic with our first off just edition

9

00:00:34,220  -->  00:00:36,900
addition can be done with just a plus sign.

10

00:00:37,290  -->  00:00:41,400
And then you can almost These are just as a simple calculator which is basically going to be doing for

11

00:00:41,400  -->  00:00:42,300
this lesson.

12

00:00:42,460  -->  00:00:46,190
Go ahead and click enter to run that and you have one plus two is three.

13

00:00:46,380  -->  00:00:50,490
Again just the number and another number.

14

00:00:50,490  -->  00:00:51,470
Cetera.

15

00:00:51,750  -->  00:00:55,000
And you can do this with floating point numbers as well.

16

00:00:55,020  -->  00:00:57,950
So that's numbers of a decimal in them.

17

00:00:58,400  -->  00:01:02,980
You can see that the decimals are added up just as you would expect subtraction.

18

00:01:03,150  -->  00:01:05,990
As you might have guessed it's just going to be a minus sign.

19

00:01:05,990  -->  00:01:12,780
So do five minus three to notice that you're probably going to want to try your best to use spacing

20

00:01:12,780  -->  00:01:14,730
for readability.

21

00:01:14,730  -->  00:01:20,370
So here I would say five minus three is more readable in the second iteration than the first one.

22

00:01:20,490  -->  00:01:22,500
First one kind of looks like just five space.

23

00:01:22,500  -->  00:01:24,970
Negative three which is technically the same thing.

24

00:01:25,110  -->  00:01:30,080
The way are is going to read it but you always want to make your code as readable as possible for division

25

00:01:30,120  -->  00:01:30,400
.

26

00:01:30,520  -->  00:01:32,500
Just going to be a slash.

27

00:01:32,580  -->  00:01:38,160
So that's one divided by two 0.5 and the vision is going to perform what's known as true division.

28

00:01:38,160  -->  00:01:40,250
So Ill perform division.

29

00:01:40,320  -->  00:01:42,740
And keep in mind the decimals.

30

00:01:42,780  -->  00:01:50,460
So the remainders etc. all right for exponents or to the power of you can use a little carrot symbol

31

00:01:50,460  -->  00:01:50,480
.

32

00:01:50,490  -->  00:01:53,050
So that's above the 6 on a keyboard.

33

00:01:53,070  -->  00:01:56,250
So two to the power of three is eight.

34

00:01:56,610  -->  00:02:02,790
And do say four it's the power for 256 etc..

35

00:02:02,880  -->  00:02:09,480
All right well one other note is that order of operations is followed in are as you would just expect

36

00:02:09,540  -->  00:02:10,600
to be.

37

00:02:10,800  -->  00:02:25,180
So for example if I said a hundred times two plus 50 divided by two and put those together I get 225

38

00:02:25,200  -->  00:02:25,490
.

39

00:02:25,590  -->  00:02:27,390
So order of operations is followed.

40

00:02:27,390  -->  00:02:33,120
Meaning I'm going to do 100 times to first to get 200 than 50 divided by two.

41

00:02:33,120  -->  00:02:41,520
Since division is the next one up which is 25 and then 200 plus 25 is 225 if I want to actually specify

42

00:02:41,550  -->  00:02:44,780
particular orders of operations I can use parentheses.

43

00:02:44,970  -->  00:02:50,610
So for example I could say something like 100 times and with parentheses designate that I wanted to

44

00:02:50,610  -->  00:02:58,210
actually add 2 plus 50 first and then divide right to accepter.

45

00:02:58,470  -->  00:03:01,610
OK so everything's working probably as you would expect it to.

46

00:03:01,620  -->  00:03:03,840
Just basic arithmetic.

47

00:03:04,110  -->  00:03:11,040
The last operation I want to show is the motter modular operation which basically just returns the remainder

48

00:03:11,040  -->  00:03:12,470
of a division.

49

00:03:12,480  -->  00:03:18,720
So for example if I say five divided by two I want to get two point five.

50

00:03:18,840  -->  00:03:24,570
So that means that two times two is four and I have a remainder of 1 right.

51

00:03:24,570  -->  00:03:29,040
So by about about 2 is 2.5 if I actually want to get the remainder.

52

00:03:29,040  -->  00:03:35,680
I can use the modulo operation which in R is two sets of percentage signs.

53

00:03:36,270  -->  00:03:39,890
So that can be read as 5 2 and the remainder is 1.

54

00:03:39,900  -->  00:03:43,370
And all this is doing is just returning in the remainder of a division.

55

00:03:43,740  -->  00:03:56,250
So for example if I say 10 maade something like 8 I'll get two since a can only go into 10 once with

56

00:03:56,250  -->  00:03:57,710
a remainder of two.

57

00:03:57,960  -->  00:04:00,080
Since eight plus two is equal to 10.

58

00:04:00,120  -->  00:04:04,230
So that's just going to give you the remainder in a division.

59

00:04:04,230  -->  00:04:09,630
This is really useful later on for checking if numbers are even or odd or third divisible by a certain

60

00:04:09,630  -->  00:04:10,300
number.

61

00:04:10,300  -->  00:04:11,160
Cetera.

62

00:04:11,280  -->  00:04:11,860
OK.

63

00:04:12,060  -->  00:04:14,130
Hopefully those are all pretty straightforward.

64

00:04:14,130  -->  00:04:18,390
You can just review this lecture or the notes for this lecture in case you ever want to reference what

65

00:04:18,390  -->  00:04:21,190
the actual symbols or operations are for arithmetic.

66

00:04:21,500  -->  00:04:27,740
OK that's it in the next lecture We'll talk about some basic data types in here.

67

00:04:27,750  -->  00:04:29,410
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture
