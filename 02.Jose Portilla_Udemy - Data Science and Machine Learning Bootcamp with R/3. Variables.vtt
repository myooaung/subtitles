00:00:01.080  -->  00:00:04.380
Hello everyone and welcome to the lecture on variables.

2

00:00:04.380  -->  00:00:09.990
This lecture we're going to go over some conventions on naming variables and how to assign the variables

3

00:00:10.080  -->  00:00:11.040
in R.

4

00:00:11.220  -->  00:00:13.710
Let's go ahead and jump to our studio.

5

00:00:13.710  -->  00:00:19.260
All right so here we are our studio and what I'm going to show you is just a couple of things that we're

6

00:00:19.260  -->  00:00:23.610
going to be learning as we begin our journey on learning the our programming language.

7

00:00:23.610  -->  00:00:27.030
And the first one we want to know is what actually comments or code.

8

00:00:27.270  -->  00:00:32.130
So what if you just want to leave yourself some notes either in your script or in the console.

9

00:00:32.130  -->  00:00:37.970
You can do is use a hash tag and this is similar to the Python programming language.

10

00:00:38.160  -->  00:00:44.070
And then whatever you write after the hash tag such as this is a comments.

11

00:00:44.130  -->  00:00:50.150
If you end up running this you'll notice that nothing comes out.

12

00:00:50.190  -->  00:00:53.040
So let's go ahead and show that in the console.

13

00:00:53.040  -->  00:01:03.540
So if I say something like print Hello enter and then if I were to do the exact same thing with a hash

14

00:01:03.540  -->  00:01:08.530
tag in front of it notice that I don't get any output because R won't read anything.

15

00:01:08.550  -->  00:01:11.510
Pass the hash tag because it treats it as just that comments.

16

00:01:11.520  -->  00:01:13.950
So that's one thing I want you to be aware of.

17

00:01:14.160  -->  00:01:20.460
And now let's go ahead and discuss variables and how to assign variables so variable names by convention

18

00:01:20.470  -->  00:01:20.900
.

19

00:01:21.120  -->  00:01:23.240
Start off with lower case letters.

20

00:01:23.520  -->  00:01:35.010
So if you had something like variable you would say use this assignment operator and then put in whatever

21

00:01:35.010  -->  00:01:37.410
you want to assign that variable.

22

00:01:37.440  -->  00:01:39.140
So what's actually happening here.

23

00:01:39.240  -->  00:01:40.560
We created a variable name.

24

00:01:40.560  -->  00:01:46.020
This case is called variable and we use the assignment operator which is this basically looks like an

25

00:01:46.020  -->  00:01:48.360
arrow which is nice for readability.

26

00:01:48.360  -->  00:01:52.860
So it's this less and and then a minus or a dash.

27

00:01:52.860  -->  00:01:58.440
So they form an arrow and then on the right hand side whatever data object or data type you want to

28

00:01:58.440  -->  00:01:59.520
assign to that very well.

29

00:01:59.520  -->  00:02:04.010
So for this lecturer it's going to be dealing with integers since that's something we've dealt with

30

00:02:04.020  -->  00:02:04.820
before.

31

00:02:05.130  -->  00:02:08.210
In the example of arithmetic.

32

00:02:08.460  -->  00:02:13.980
So here I am in signing the integer 100 to the variable called variable.

33

00:02:13.980  -->  00:02:20.910
So if I call variable again and then go ahead and just click enter in the council will return its assigned

34

00:02:20.910  -->  00:02:22.960
value which is 100.

35

00:02:22.980  -->  00:02:30.400
So let's go ahead and imagine another example will say bank and assignats 1000.

36

00:02:30.840  -->  00:02:35.050
So now if I call bank I get 1000 out as the assignments.

37

00:02:35.070  -->  00:02:37.500
So that's a variable assignment works.

38

00:02:37.560  -->  00:02:42.090
And you'll notice here in the environment if you ever want to know what variables you have or what values

39

00:02:42.090  -->  00:02:48.390
you have in your global environment for this session of Are You can reference this here.

40

00:02:48.390  -->  00:02:56.180
So just some quick style guides and convention points usually what you want to do is let's say you want

41

00:02:56.200  -->  00:02:59.340
to have multiple words in your variable name.

42

00:02:59.340  -->  00:03:04.290
What you would do is separate them by a period or dot.

43

00:03:04.440  -->  00:03:12.720
So we can say something like bank accounts and then assign that 100 so that's acceptable.

44

00:03:12.720  -->  00:03:20.250
Sometimes you also see this sort of notation bank and then instead of a dot They just write a capital

45

00:03:20.280  -->  00:03:22.560
A.

46

00:03:23.460  -->  00:03:31.240
What you won't see in our as often and is usually known as a bad style season.

47

00:03:31.290  -->  00:03:39.060
Underscore now it will still work completely So each of these is technically correct you can use all

48

00:03:39.060  -->  00:03:44.970
of these methods but the most common styles you'll see is this Fersen right here separating each of

49

00:03:44.970  -->  00:03:46.450
the words.

50

00:03:46.500  -->  00:03:48.390
All right.

51

00:03:48.390  -->  00:03:53.730
Later on when we discuss functions we'll go over the style guides for namea your functions and functions

52

00:03:53.730  -->  00:03:57.600
will actually usually start with capital letters.

53

00:03:57.600  -->  00:04:03.990
So finally just go ahead and show a quick simple example how you can use variables to perform calculations

54

00:04:04.050  -->  00:04:05.350
in operations that are.

55

00:04:05.460  -->  00:04:07.190
Let's go ahead and clear the cons..

56

00:04:07.400  -->  00:04:12.690
And here in Windows I'm clearing the consulars by doing control L as a shortcut for that.

57

00:04:12.720  -->  00:04:19.550
So I'm just going to go ahead and say make a variable deposit assign it.

58

00:04:19.860  -->  00:04:22.040
Let's just say 20 enter.

59

00:04:22.050  -->  00:04:31.350
So I have my deposit and I'm going to say bank accounts bank account and I'm going to reassign bank

60

00:04:31.530  -->  00:04:37.820
accounts as my current bank account plus my deposit.

61

00:04:37.860  -->  00:04:44.220
So notice here before I actually run this line my bank account variable is equal to 100.

62

00:04:44.220  -->  00:04:47.580
My deposit is equal to 20 after running this line.

63

00:04:47.580  -->  00:04:54.720
What's going to happen by click enter my bank account is going to be equal to 120.

64

00:04:54.930  -->  00:05:01.530
So that's going to be the 20 plus the previous 100 value of bank account and it's going to update that

65

00:05:01.530  -->  00:05:06.810
variable which is bank accounts and that's the basic way you can use variables in a variable assignment

66

00:05:06.810  -->  00:05:07.740
operations.

67

00:05:07.820  -->  00:05:11.750
In our ok player I think it's pretty straightforward.

68

00:05:11.760  -->  00:05:18.000
The main thing to go to this lecture is that this symbol this arrow symbol is what you're going to be

69

00:05:18.000  -->  00:05:21.440
using for variable assignments in our.

70

00:05:21.780  -->  00:05:22.320
Okay.

71

00:05:22.380  -->  00:05:23.240
Thanks everyone.

72

00:05:23.250  -->  00:05:24.170
I'll see you at the next lecture
