Hello everyone and welcome to the lecture on getting help with our in this brief lecture.

2

00:00:05,670  -->  00:00:08,970
We're just going to discuss a couple of useful ways to get help.

3

00:00:09,030  -->  00:00:12,950
When you're programming of our let's go ahead and hop over to our studio.

4

00:00:13,230  -->  00:00:13,650
OK.

5

00:00:13,650  -->  00:00:19,650
So here we are our studio and I'm just going to show you a few ways you can get help with our the main

6

00:00:19,650  -->  00:00:23,070
way you can get help for it just by using a help function.

7

00:00:23,070  -->  00:00:27,900
So for example let's see you wanted to get help with doctors.

8

00:00:28,080  -->  00:00:29,300
You could say something like this.

9

00:00:29,310  -->  00:00:34,380
Help open parentheses and then just pass on the topic.

10

00:00:34,380  -->  00:00:42,330
So again it's past and the topic doctor and you should see here on the Help tab of the lower right hand

11

00:00:42,330  -->  00:00:49,020
panel a help documents for the documentation will show up describing vectors telling you your usage

12

00:00:49,050  -->  00:00:49,620
for them.

13

00:00:49,620  -->  00:00:53,700
The arguments details and even examples of vectors at the bottom.

14

00:00:53,700  -->  00:00:59,810
So there's a really useful way of using our documentation directly from the our programming environment

15

00:00:59,820  -->  00:01:00,160
.

16

00:01:00,480  -->  00:01:04,710
In other way you can get help is by using two sets of question marks.

17

00:01:04,890  -->  00:01:13,740
So for example you could type in a question mark question mark vector and you would get the same result

18

00:01:13,740  -->  00:01:14,160
.

19

00:01:14,160  -->  00:01:18,700
So let me go ahead and show that and another word cxi the change.

20

00:01:18,810  -->  00:01:21,220
Let's say I wanted to know more about gnumeric.

21

00:01:21,700  -->  00:01:22,880
I clicked enter.

22

00:01:22,890  -->  00:01:30,360
I get search results for numeric then America is actually quite a general term so you get a lot of results

23

00:01:30,360  -->  00:01:31,510
here and help.

24

00:01:31,860  -->  00:01:39,240
If you actually want to specifically search for help you can do help search and then search whatever

25

00:01:39,240  -->  00:01:40,840
terms you were curious about.

26

00:01:40,830  -->  00:01:45,720
So let's say you are curious a little more about vectors and you just wanted to search for vectors that

27

00:01:45,720  -->  00:01:49,330
go directly to the help page for that particular data type.

28

00:01:49,500  -->  00:01:55,200
So you did it just a basic search for help in the R for vectors in the documentation.

29

00:01:55,200  -->  00:01:57,000
All right.

30

00:01:57,000  -->  00:01:58,200
So that's really all there is to it.

31

00:01:58,230  -->  00:02:04,470
As far as getting help within are of course doing a good google search or checking out Stack Overflow

32

00:02:04,470  -->  00:02:08,570
for your questions is another great way to find help when you're programming.

33

00:02:08,580  -->  00:02:11,840
Our thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
