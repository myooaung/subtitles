Hello everyone and welcome to the support vector machines project in this lecture video Well we're going

2

00:00:06.000  -->  00:00:10.560
to be doing is just going over the notebook for the support vector machines project before we actually

3

00:00:10.560  -->  00:00:12.140
tackle it on your own.

4

00:00:12.150  -->  00:00:14.280
Let's go ahead and jump to that notebook.

5

00:00:14.310  -->  00:00:14.780
OK.

6

00:00:14.820  -->  00:00:19.440
Here we are at the notebook for this project we're going to be doing is exploring publicly available

7

00:00:19.440  -->  00:00:25.290
data from Lending Club dot com Lending Club is a company and a Web site that connects people who need

8

00:00:25.290  -->  00:00:29.840
money called borrowers with people who have money called investors.

9

00:00:29.830  -->  00:00:35.250
Hopefully as an investor you want to invest in people who show a profile of having a high probability

10

00:00:35.250  -->  00:00:37.260
of paying you back your money.

11

00:00:37.320  -->  00:00:42.000
But we're going to be doing is trying to create a model of support vector machines to help predict this

12

00:00:42.000  -->  00:00:42.690
.

13

00:00:42.690  -->  00:00:47.910
A quick side note Lending Club had a really interesting and kind of dramatic year in 2016.

14

00:00:47.910  -->  00:00:51.200
So we can check out some of their data and keep that context in mind.

15

00:00:51.270  -->  00:00:55.710
All the data we're going to be using from the sea as we file provided for you is from even before they

16

00:00:55.710  -->  00:01:00.040
went public from the years 2007 to 2010.

17

00:01:00.270  -->  00:01:04.710
First are going to be checking up data opening it checking out the summary and structure of the loans

18

00:01:05.160  -->  00:01:10.030
then you're going to do a little bit of exploratory data analysis of Jeezy plus to creating some histogram

19

00:01:10.030  -->  00:01:10.800
shown here.

20

00:01:10.890  -->  00:01:17.130
A bar plot and then a scatterplot and there's an option for coloring that scatterplot on who paid and

21

00:01:17.130  -->  00:01:18.620
who didn't pay.

22

00:01:18.690  -->  00:01:22.830
After that you can go ahead and start building the model you'll split your data into a training and

23

00:01:22.830  -->  00:01:23.770
test set.

24

00:01:23.910  -->  00:01:29.760
You'll create the support vector machine model and you'll get a summary of the model then please predict

25

00:01:29.760  -->  00:01:31.670
functions predict new values.

26

00:01:32.040  -->  00:01:37.670
You'll realize that just using the base parameters will actually get you very good predictions which

27

00:01:37.670  -->  00:01:44.220
will end up having to do is tune your model and there is some hints here as to how to use the tune function

28

00:01:44.220  -->  00:01:45.740
in order to do this.

29

00:01:45.750  -->  00:01:51.720
A quick note the lecture kind of ends at the tuning model phase because the pin industry of your computer

30

00:01:51.900  -->  00:01:54.710
the tune function could take a really long time.

31

00:01:54.780  -->  00:01:57.520
Go ahead and keep in mind if you have a slower computer.

32

00:01:57.570  -->  00:02:02.340
Don't put so many parameters otherwise you'll be tuning all day just creating those various support

33

00:02:02.370  -->  00:02:04.930
vector machines functions etc..

34

00:02:05.370  -->  00:02:05.880
OK.

35

00:02:06.060  -->  00:02:10.080
Hopefully you enjoy this project and I will see it the next lecture where we will be going over these

36

00:02:10.080  -->  00:02:11.800
solutions for the project.

37

00:02:11.850  -->  00:02:12.260
Thanks.

38

00:02:12.270  -->  00:02:12.870
And also either
