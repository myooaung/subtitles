Hello everyone and welcome to the K means clustering project.

2

00:00:04.460  -->  00:00:08.670
In this lecture video we're going to be going over the notebook for the Kamins clustering project and

3

00:00:08.670  -->  00:00:10.150
explain what you'll be doing.

4

00:00:10.320  -->  00:00:12.870
What's good and jumped to notebook to get started.

5

00:00:12.870  -->  00:00:13.190
All right.

6

00:00:13.190  -->  00:00:18.060
Here we are at the notebook for the project the Kamins clustering project and I wanted to note that

7

00:00:18.060  -->  00:00:23.220
usually when you're dealing with unsupervised learning problems such as k means clustering it's difficult

8

00:00:23.220  -->  00:00:26.700
to get a good measure of how well the model actually performed.

9

00:00:26.760  -->  00:00:32.880
For this project we're going to be doing is using data from the UCI archive which is based off of red

10

00:00:32.910  -->  00:00:33.900
and white wines.

11

00:00:33.900  -->  00:00:39.720
It's actually really commonly used data in machine learning where we're going to do is strip the label

12

00:00:39.810  -->  00:00:45.630
indicating whether the wine was a red or white wine and see if we can use Kamins clustering to cluster

13

00:00:45.720  -->  00:00:51.510
the wine training points based solely off of their features without actually showing the label to any

14

00:00:51.510  -->  00:00:52.410
models.

15

00:00:52.410  -->  00:00:58.320
Then what we can do is put the label back and compare how well our clustering algorithm perform versus

16

00:00:58.320  -->  00:01:00.570
the true labels that we actually already know.

17

00:01:00.630  -->  00:01:05.310
Just keep in mind that usually for unsupervised learning problems in real life you won't have the luxury

18

00:01:05.370  -->  00:01:10.740
of being able being able to bring that label back as far as the actual process you're going to be doing

19

00:01:10.740  -->  00:01:11.100
.

20

00:01:11.100  -->  00:01:12.740
You'll go ahead and get that data.

21

00:01:12.780  -->  00:01:17.880
You can either download the two data the files from the repository or just use the ones already included

22

00:01:18.030  -->  00:01:20.000
in the notebook download.

23

00:01:20.010  -->  00:01:22.380
Then you'll go ahead and explore the data a little bit.

24

00:01:22.380  -->  00:01:27.780
You'll do some exploratory data analysis such as creating histograms of the data indicating red and

25

00:01:27.780  -->  00:01:32.730
white by color and you also do some scatter plots.

26

00:01:32.730  -->  00:01:36.710
Once you've done your exploratory data analysis you'll go ahead and start building the clusters isn't

27

00:01:36.720  -->  00:01:41.790
that Kamins algorithm then finally we'll be able to evaluate the clusters because we actually have the

28

00:01:41.790  -->  00:01:45.520
luxury of having that label data red or white wine.

29

00:01:45.570  -->  00:01:46.210
All right.

30

00:01:46.230  -->  00:01:49.710
Hope you enjoy this project go ahead and take your time through it.

31

00:01:49.710  -->  00:01:51.270
And I will see you at the next lecture.

32

00:01:51.270  -->  00:01:53.820
Will we'll be going over the solutions for the project.

33

00:01:53.850  -->  00:01:55.700
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture
