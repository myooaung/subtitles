00:00:06.180  -->  00:00:11.100
Hello everyone and welcome to an introduction to machine learning you finally reached the second half

2

00:00:11.100  -->  00:00:16.470
of this course which focuses a lot more on machine learning machine learning theory and how to implement

3

00:00:16.470  -->  00:00:21.690
machine learning algorithms in our let's go ahead and get started it's an introduction to the section

4

00:00:21.690  -->  00:00:25.290
of the Course or the second half of the course.

5

00:00:25.320  -->  00:00:30.330
We're going to be using an introduction to statistical learning by Gareth James as a companion book

6

00:00:30.330  -->  00:00:30.780
.

7

00:00:30.780  -->  00:00:32.820
It's freely available online.

8

00:00:32.850  -->  00:00:35.020
So let's go ahead and see how we can get it.

9

00:00:35.050  -->  00:00:39.630
I'm going to go ahead and quickly hop to my browser to show you how you can get a free copy of an introduction

10

00:00:39.920  -->  00:00:41.460
to mystical learning.

11

00:00:41.490  -->  00:00:41.760
All right.

12

00:00:41.760  -->  00:00:43.230
Here I am at Google.

13

00:00:43.230  -->  00:00:46.740
All you have to do is Google search the term in capital letters.

14

00:00:46.740  -->  00:00:49.470
I s l r enter.

15

00:00:49.500  -->  00:00:54.690
And you should see the very first link be an introduction to school learning.

16

00:00:54.690  -->  00:00:58.860
Click on that and then look for the link that says Get the book.

17

00:00:58.860  -->  00:01:04.380
Go out and click on this and you can get a free copy of the book as a PDA.

18

00:01:04.380  -->  00:01:10.770
From the official Web site Garreth James is a professor at USC and he makes this book freely available

19

00:01:10.800  -->  00:01:11.720
as a PDA.

20

00:01:11.910  -->  00:01:17.970
You can also purchase it if you want a physical copy but will just be using the PDAF as a companion

21

00:01:17.970  -->  00:01:18.500
.

22

00:01:18.600  -->  00:01:23.160
Once it's finished loading you should have PDA that looks something like this and this is the introduction

23

00:01:23.160  -->  00:01:25.990
to school learning book with applications and are.

24

00:01:26.220  -->  00:01:31.320
This is one of the best books to start learning about machine learning statistical learning is basically

25

00:01:31.320  -->  00:01:34.990
just a more mathematical word for machine learning.

26

00:01:35.010  -->  00:01:38.160
You scroll down there's tons of topics included in this book.

27

00:01:38.250  -->  00:01:40.780
Let me go ahead and just show you the Table of Contents.

28

00:01:40.790  -->  00:01:43.700
I'm going to hold it and zoom in here.

29

00:01:43.740  -->  00:01:48.930
There's an introduction and then there's a definition of what statistical learning is for the second

30

00:01:49.140  -->  00:01:50.910
chapter in the book.

31

00:01:51.030  -->  00:01:56.430
Then there's discussions of the linear regression classification methods resampling methods linear model

32

00:01:56.430  -->  00:01:59.040
selection regularisation etc..

33

00:01:59.100  -->  00:02:04.530
Now keep in mind this book is pretty mathematical and you do need to have an understanding of how to

34

00:02:04.530  -->  00:02:09.630
read statistical formulas in order to fully understand and appreciate everything that's in this book

35

00:02:09.630  -->  00:02:09.990
.

36

00:02:09.990  -->  00:02:10.310
All right.

37

00:02:10.320  -->  00:02:13.320
So hopefully you have time to go ahead and download this PDA.

38

00:02:13.320  -->  00:02:18.030
Again it's completely free and the author makes it freely available on the Web site and you can purchase

39

00:02:18.030  -->  00:02:21.030
a physical copy if you like or prefer that.

40

00:02:21.030  -->  00:02:23.980
Let me go ahead and jump back to the presentation.

41

00:02:24.000  -->  00:02:24.270
All right.

42

00:02:24.270  -->  00:02:27.890
Here we are back again and remember to get this free copy of the PDA.

43

00:02:27.930  -->  00:02:33.390
All you have to do is Google search the term I s l r and you should find this as the first link and

44

00:02:33.390  -->  00:02:39.150
then click on get book as PDA or you can just probably google search introduction to Mystikal learning

45

00:02:39.150  -->  00:02:39.440
.

46

00:02:39.460  -->  00:02:43.900
Then again the first thing that pops up in google will be the link to get this book.

47

00:02:44.700  -->  00:02:48.720
Now there's probably going to be two types of students continuing on to the machine learning section

48

00:02:48.720  -->  00:02:49.670
of this course.

49

00:02:49.740  -->  00:02:53.640
There's going to be students who want the mathematical theory and they should do the reading that's

50

00:02:53.640  -->  00:02:58.380
assigned throughout the machine learning sections and lectures of the course.

51

00:02:58.650  -->  00:03:03.490
Then there's probably students who just want life theory and are more interested in our applications

52

00:03:03.490  -->  00:03:08.910
and how to code out these algorithms and are for these students you should just be fine with the general

53

00:03:08.910  -->  00:03:13.250
light theory presentation given before each machine learning lecture.

54

00:03:13.260  -->  00:03:16.750
However I would highly recommend that you still try to do the reading.

55

00:03:16.890  -->  00:03:21.890
That's it's really going to boost your understanding of machine learning algorithms.

56

00:03:22.830  -->  00:03:28.110
If you are interested in doing the reading go ahead and read chapters 1 and 2 to gain a background understanding

57

00:03:28.380  -->  00:03:31.160
before continuing on to the machine learning lectures.

58

00:03:31.170  -->  00:03:34.140
That means after you finish watching this lecture video.

59

00:03:34.140  -->  00:03:39.420
Go ahead download the introduction to the school learning book and read chapters 1 and 2.

60

00:03:39.660  -->  00:03:44.700
A lot of the theory in mathematics are explained extremely well in that book and I always recommend

61

00:03:44.700  -->  00:03:50.970
to my students to actually read through and understand the SLR book.

62

00:03:51.060  -->  00:03:55.170
Let's go ahead and continue our discussion of machine learning by just talking about in general.

63

00:03:55.170  -->  00:03:59.730
Machine learning is and we can expect to learn in the second half of this course.

64

00:03:59.730  -->  00:04:06.690
Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building using algorithms

65

00:04:06.690  -->  00:04:09.080
that it's really learned from data.

66

00:04:09.120  -->  00:04:14.880
Machine learning allows computers to find the hidden insights without being explicitly programmed where

67

00:04:14.880  -->  00:04:17.120
to look.

68

00:04:17.150  -->  00:04:21.990
Now you may be wondering what is machine learning used for machine learning has so many applications

69

00:04:21.990  -->  00:04:23.870
that I can't fit them all this slide.

70

00:04:24.000  -->  00:04:29.340
But a few of them are things like fraud detection real time ads that are relevant to users on web pages

71

00:04:29.640  -->  00:04:36.060
prediction of equipment failures network intrusion detection e-mail spam filtering financial modeling

72

00:04:36.270  -->  00:04:42.900
tech sentiment analysis recommendation engines and so much more let's talk about the general machine

73

00:04:42.900  -->  00:04:48.840
learning process this is the process we're going to be implementing as we learn how to do machine learning

74

00:04:48.840  -->  00:04:52.560
with our first play to acquire our data.

75

00:04:52.560  -->  00:04:57.870
These will be C S V files for the most part or built in data frames or data sets and are throughout

76

00:04:57.870  -->  00:04:59.180
the rest of this course.

77

00:04:59.320  -->  00:05:04.680
What you have acquired that data will need to clean that data and will need to do some exploratory data

78

00:05:04.680  -->  00:05:05.800
analysis.

79

00:05:05.850  -->  00:05:11.250
This step is heavily emphasized in the machine learning exercise projects throughout this course.

80

00:05:11.250  -->  00:05:18.390
Then after that you will go ahead and split that clean data into test data and training data.

81

00:05:18.720  -->  00:05:23.290
Then you will train a machine learning model on your training data.

82

00:05:23.310  -->  00:05:28.620
Once you've trained the model what you're going to do is test your model on the test data that you went

83

00:05:28.620  -->  00:05:31.080
ahead and split off your clean data.

84

00:05:31.080  -->  00:05:37.140
This allows you to accurately evaluate your model since that machine learning model has actually seen

85

00:05:37.140  -->  00:05:38.470
that test data yet.

86

00:05:38.640  -->  00:05:43.590
And then you can go ahead and repeat this process to your model until you're satisfied with it.

87

00:05:43.830  -->  00:05:50.310
Once you're satisfied with the testing of your model you can go ahead and deploy your model.

88

00:05:50.310  -->  00:05:54.200
Let's talk about the three major types of machine learning algorithms.

89

00:05:54.420  -->  00:06:00.840
Well first start with supervised learning supervised learning algorithms are trained using labeled examples

90

00:06:01.170  -->  00:06:04.680
such as an input where the desired output is known.

91

00:06:04.710  -->  00:06:12.420
For example a piece of equipment could have data points labeled either F or failed or R for runs the

92

00:06:12.420  -->  00:06:19.440
learning algorithm receives a set of inputs along the corresponding correct outputs which are the labels

93

00:06:19.830  -->  00:06:26.040
and then the algorithm learns by comparing its actual output with the correct outputs to find errors

94

00:06:26.430  -->  00:06:28.940
that then modifies the model accordingly.

95

00:06:28.950  -->  00:06:36.660
That means supervised learning can take in data that is labeled through methods like classification

96

00:06:36.690  -->  00:06:42.540
regression prediction and gradient boosting supervised learning uses patterns to predict the values

97

00:06:42.540  -->  00:06:45.680
of the label on additional unlabeled data.

98

00:06:45.720  -->  00:06:46.930
And that's your test data.

99

00:06:47.040  -->  00:06:52.380
The stuff that's unlabelled you're either trying to predict or figure out a label like classification

100

00:06:52.440  -->  00:06:58.470
for supervised learning is commonly used in applications where historical data predicts likely future

101

00:06:58.470  -->  00:07:00.420
events.

102

00:07:00.930  -->  00:07:06.540
For example it can anticipate when credit card transactions are likely to be fraudulent or which insurance

103

00:07:06.540  -->  00:07:11.170
customer is likely to file a claim and will actually do machine learning projects.

104

00:07:11.240  -->  00:07:16.500
We deal with insurance information supervised learning can also be used to attempt to bring that the

105

00:07:16.650  -->  00:07:23.630
price of a house based on different features for houses for which if historical price data.

106

00:07:23.640  -->  00:07:30.660
Now let's talk about unsupervised learning unsupervised learning is used against data that has no historical

107

00:07:30.660  -->  00:07:31.610
labels.

108

00:07:31.650  -->  00:07:34.170
The system is not told the correct answer.

109

00:07:34.200  -->  00:07:36.250
It doesn't know the correct label.

110

00:07:36.330  -->  00:07:39.390
The algorithm must figure out what is being shown.

111

00:07:39.420  -->  00:07:45.510
The goal with unsupervised learning is to explore the data and find some sort of structure within the

112

00:07:45.510  -->  00:07:46.730
data itself.

113

00:07:47.010  -->  00:07:52.050
The main difference between unsupervised learning and supervised learning is that with supervised learning

114

00:07:52.560  -->  00:08:00.660
algorithms need labelled data unsupervised learning tries to find the label for unisons it has data

115

00:08:00.720  -->  00:08:03.320
that has no historical labels.

116

00:08:04.030  -->  00:08:08.980
Unsupervised learning can also find the main attributes that separate customer segments from each other

117

00:08:08.990  -->  00:08:09.060
.

118

00:08:09.090  -->  00:08:15.420
As an example of a use case popular techniques for self organizing maps nearest neighbor mapping k means

119

00:08:15.420  -->  00:08:18.270
clustering is singular valued composition.

120

00:08:18.350  -->  00:08:22.890
Are all examples of unsupervised learning processes.

121

00:08:22.890  -->  00:08:29.280
These algorithms are also used to segment text topics recommend items and identify data outliers so

122

00:08:29.280  -->  00:08:35.250
things such as natural language processing and use unsupervised learning methods.

123

00:08:35.280  -->  00:08:40.260
Finally we'll talk about reinforcement learning reinforcement learning is often used for things such

124

00:08:40.260  -->  00:08:47.010
as robotics gaming and navigation with reinforcement learning the algorithm discovers through trial

125

00:08:47.010  -->  00:08:51.710
and error which actions yield the greatest rewards.

126

00:08:51.720  -->  00:08:54.450
This type of learning has three primary components.

127

00:08:54.450  -->  00:09:00.420
The agent which is the learner or decision maker the environment everything the agent interacts with

128

00:09:00.720  -->  00:09:03.230
and actions what the agent can do.

129

00:09:03.870  -->  00:09:09.720
The objective is for the agent to choose actions that maximize the expected reward over a given amount

130

00:09:09.720  -->  00:09:15.600
of time and then the agent will reach the goal much faster by following a good policy.

131

00:09:15.600  -->  00:09:20.730
Don't worry too much about reinforcement learning for now will cover it much more in detail when we

132

00:09:20.730  -->  00:09:25.440
actually get to neural nets which are going to be our example of reinforcement learning at the very

133

00:09:25.530  -->  00:09:26.930
end of this course.

134

00:09:28.410  -->  00:09:33.710
And again the goal in reinforcement learning is to learn the best policy.

135

00:09:33.750  -->  00:09:37.160
Let's talk about machine learning and this course and how we're actually going to approach each of these

136

00:09:37.160  -->  00:09:43.010
topics for each algorithm or machine learning topic you're going to have a reading assignment based

137

00:09:43.000  -->  00:09:48.470
off of the introduction to statistical learning book that means at the very beginning of the theory

138

00:09:48.470  -->  00:09:50.960
lecture I'm going to give you a reading assignment.

139

00:09:50.960  -->  00:09:56.090
Again I would highly recommend you do the reading assignment but if you're just interested in the light

140

00:09:56.140  -->  00:10:00.260
theory and application of our you could possibly skip over the reading assignment.

141

00:10:00.290  -->  00:10:02.330
However I wouldn't recommend that.

142

00:10:02.570  -->  00:10:07.950
Then after you do the reading assignment I'll give you a very light overview of the theory.

143

00:10:08.120  -->  00:10:12.980
Then we have a demonstration lecture with our showing you a demonstration of how you can actually use

144

00:10:12.980  -->  00:10:18.830
the machine learning algorithm we just talked about in the theory lecture with our programming then

145

00:10:18.830  -->  00:10:21.500
you'll have a machine learning project assignment.

146

00:10:21.530  -->  00:10:25.420
This is an assignment similar to the training exercises you've already done.

147

00:10:25.420  -->  00:10:30.380
You'll be given a data set and you'll be having to follow certain tasks and eventually perform some

148

00:10:30.380  -->  00:10:32.950
sort of machine learning algorithm on that topic.

149

00:10:33.050  -->  00:10:37.770
Then once you've attempted that machine learning project will go ahead and do an overview of solution

150

00:10:37.760  -->  00:10:40.600
a walkthrough for that particular project.

151

00:10:40.630  -->  00:10:45.020
Let me go ahead and give you a real tour of the machine learning notes and how to approach the machine

152

00:10:45.050  -->  00:10:47.600
learning notes for this section of the course.

153

00:10:47.720  -->  00:10:49.060
I want to go ahead and jump to the notes.

154

00:10:49.070  -->  00:10:54.920
Now here I am at the notes and I want to point out that there's two folders that are going to be relevant

155

00:10:55.120  -->  00:10:57.570
for the machine learning half of this course.

156

00:10:57.580  -->  00:11:03.100
There's the machine learning with our folder and then there's again the training exercises folder which

157

00:11:03.110  -->  00:11:06.410
you can do as you approach each new machine learning topic.

158

00:11:06.530  -->  00:11:13.780
You'll get a machine learning with R and then you'll see a bunch of HVM l files that correspond to that

159

00:11:13.790  -->  00:11:15.090
particular topic.

160

00:11:15.130  -->  00:11:18.910
For instance the very first one is going to be the linear regression lecture.

161

00:11:19.120  -->  00:11:25.210
These actual notebooks correspond with the application with our lecture.

162

00:11:25.280  -->  00:11:28.530
Let me show an example or linear regression.

163

00:11:28.550  -->  00:11:34.070
You'll first see a reading assignment for linear regression after you've done that assignment then you'll

164

00:11:34.070  -->  00:11:37.650
get a very light theory lecture on linear regression.

165

00:11:37.660  -->  00:11:42.770
Once you've done that you'll see linear regression with our lecture and that's going to be me walking

166

00:11:42.770  -->  00:11:45.540
you through how to actually do linear regression with R.

167

00:11:45.550  -->  00:11:52.070
And that means if you go ahead and double click on this linear regression lecture file you'll get something

168

00:11:52.070  -->  00:11:53.580
that looks like this.

169

00:11:53.690  -->  00:11:58.960
And again they'll be a little note saying asking you to watch the entire video linear regression and

170

00:11:58.970  -->  00:12:02.030
the reading assignment of Eissler before continuing.

171

00:12:02.060  -->  00:12:05.890
And I always recommend doing the reading assignment and then this lecture.

172

00:12:05.890  -->  00:12:11.770
What we end up doing is getting some data and this will be student performance data from UC Irvine machine

173

00:12:11.780  -->  00:12:14.170
learning repository that will learn a lot more about.

174

00:12:14.330  -->  00:12:18.300
And you can go ahead and check out all the code that I will be walking through.

175

00:12:18.350  -->  00:12:23.430
As far as the machine learning projects go now this is not a training exercise.

176

00:12:23.450  -->  00:12:25.750
You have no questions to answer here.

177

00:12:25.750  -->  00:12:31.550
This is just a reference for text information such as markdown explanations or what's actually going

178

00:12:31.550  -->  00:12:32.710
on step by step.

179

00:12:32.780  -->  00:12:34.110
And then the actual code.

180

00:12:34.370  -->  00:12:39.680
That way if you ever any questions on what I'm doing you can go ahead and reference this notebook which

181

00:12:39.680  -->  00:12:44.990
has a lot of descriptions and extra explanatory information as to what I'm actually performing in the

182

00:12:44.990  -->  00:12:45.930
lecture video.

183

00:12:46.220  -->  00:12:52.150
And you can go ahead and grab this code and copy and paste it into our studio.

184

00:12:52.150  -->  00:12:52.610
All right.

185

00:12:52.610  -->  00:12:54.030
That's what the notebooks are.

186

00:12:54.080  -->  00:12:58.420
And they also see me do some visualizations that explain every step of the way.

187

00:12:58.460  -->  00:13:02.820
We'll talk about building a model train and test data how to do all this.

188

00:13:02.840  -->  00:13:06.930
This is in the machine learning with our section of the course.

189

00:13:07.000  -->  00:13:12.260
These are the lecture notebooks that correspond to the lectures that say a machine learning algorithm

190

00:13:12.320  -->  00:13:13.460
with R..

191

00:13:13.630  -->  00:13:17.860
Once you've done that lecture you'll go ahead and begin your training exercises.

192

00:13:17.870  -->  00:13:21.890
Let me go ahead and hop back to the notes to show you how to use those.

193

00:13:21.880  -->  00:13:22.140
All right.

194

00:13:22.150  -->  00:13:24.100
Here I am back at the notes.

195

00:13:24.110  -->  00:13:30.230
Once you've done a light theory lecture and the machine learning with our lecture you'll get a machine

196

00:13:30.230  -->  00:13:36.530
learning project lecture and those notebooks you can find under the training exercises folder.

197

00:13:36.530  -->  00:13:38.520
Machine learning projects folder.

198

00:13:38.690  -->  00:13:44.080
And you'll notice you have three files for all projects and they'll project solutions and emal projects

199

00:13:44.140  -->  00:13:46.020
assignments.

200

00:13:46.100  -->  00:13:51.080
So for example once you've done the reading assignment for little linear regression lecture seen the

201

00:13:51.080  -->  00:13:56.750
light theory video for linear regression and seeing the lecture video showing you how to perform Linaria

202

00:13:56.750  -->  00:13:57.820
Russian with R..

203

00:13:57.830  -->  00:14:02.120
You'll have your first M-L project or machine learning project when you're looking for that notebook

204

00:14:02.120  -->  00:14:02.140
.

205

00:14:02.140  -->  00:14:04.130
You just come to training exercises.

206

00:14:04.220  -->  00:14:05.840
Machine learning projects.

207

00:14:05.840  -->  00:14:11.620
Click on this folder machine learning projects assignments and you'll see here the linear regression

208

00:14:11.620  -->  00:14:17.410
project or whatever algorithm project that corresponds to whatever lecture you're on.

209

00:14:17.710  -->  00:14:21.080
May go ahead and click on one of these to show you what they look like.

210

00:14:21.230  -->  00:14:27.470
For example the linear regression project notebook is a notebook here that explains just like your training

211

00:14:27.470  -->  00:14:30.910
exercise notebooks in the past to follow some instructions.

212

00:14:30.910  -->  00:14:32.520
The background for the project.

213

00:14:32.570  -->  00:14:38.390
What the data looks like and you essentially just follow the Bouldon instructions and try to go as far

214

00:14:38.380  -->  00:14:41.190
as you can without referencing the solutions.

215

00:14:41.210  -->  00:14:44.090
If you ever get stuck you can feel free to reference a solution.

216

00:14:44.140  -->  00:14:48.440
Look in this example for little linear regression project.

217

00:14:48.550  -->  00:14:52.570
We go ahead and use a bike sharing data set from Kaggle dot com.

218

00:14:52.610  -->  00:14:54.440
And if you don't know how the dot com is.

219

00:14:54.560  -->  00:14:57.720
Don't worry I'll explain that once we get to the sexual project.

220

00:14:58.040  -->  00:14:59.560
But basically just come here.

221

00:14:59.650  -->  00:15:04.790
Check out the M-L project notebook for the assignment and try your best to complete all the tasks that

222

00:15:04.850  -->  00:15:09.620
the notebook asks for you to do what you've gotten as far as you can.

223

00:15:09.950  -->  00:15:13.230
You go ahead and check out the solutions book.

224

00:15:13.270  -->  00:15:15.440
Let's go ahead and jump back to the notes.

225

00:15:15.560  -->  00:15:15.890
All right.

226

00:15:15.880  -->  00:15:21.620
Here in the notes you can go to M-L projects that solutions and you'll see corresponding solutions notebooks

227

00:15:21.880  -->  00:15:23.400
for each of these projects.

228

00:15:23.480  -->  00:15:29.780
And there's also a full video of me walking you through step by step of the solutions for this project

229

00:15:29.800  -->  00:15:30.240
.

230

00:15:30.710  -->  00:15:35.780
If you ever want data that's used the machine learning projects you can either download them the data

231

00:15:35.780  -->  00:15:41.720
sets follow the instructions in the notebooks or you can click here on CSB files for M-L projects and

232

00:15:41.750  -->  00:15:45.250
all the data you need is available here as CSP files.

233

00:15:45.350  -->  00:15:49.010
Don't worry about this little Excel diagram that's just because I'm on Windows right now.

234

00:15:49.100  -->  00:15:53.840
Even if using a macro Linux will be CSP files so you can use them as well.

235

00:15:53.840  -->  00:15:57.460
All right let's go ahead and quickly hop back to the presentation.

236

00:15:57.470  -->  00:16:01.750
All right so we've learned how the second half of this course approaches machine learning.

237

00:16:01.970  -->  00:16:07.010
And we've gotten a brief tour of the machine learning notes a couple of final notes before we continue

238

00:16:07.010  -->  00:16:10.630
on to our first linear regression topic.

239

00:16:10.630  -->  00:16:15.260
I want you to know that machine learning takes time to learn as a student.

240

00:16:15.260  -->  00:16:20.020
You should be patient with yourself and feel free to post the Q8 forums if you ever feel lost.

241

00:16:20.030  -->  00:16:24.500
Remember the students and I are here as a community to help you through this.

242

00:16:24.530  -->  00:16:29.840
You should also know that no one singular course can be a reference for all machine learning topics

243

00:16:30.200  -->  00:16:34.130
but I'm always happy to point you in the right direction for other resources.

244

00:16:34.150  -->  00:16:37.970
If you're curious about other machine learning topics.

245

00:16:37.970  -->  00:16:43.400
With that being said lets go ahead and start using our for machine learning by starting off by learning

246

00:16:43.390  -->  00:16:45.200
about linear regression.

247

00:16:45.200  -->  00:16:46.030
Thanks everyone.

248

00:16:46.050  -->  00:16:48.540
Now I will see you at the next lecture.
