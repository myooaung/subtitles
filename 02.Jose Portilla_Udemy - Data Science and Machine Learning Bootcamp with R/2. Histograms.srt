00:00:05,910  -->  00:00:10,290
Hello everyone and welcome to the lecture on histograms and this lecture we're going to learn how to

2

00:00:10,290  -->  00:00:11,980
create histograms with our.

3

00:00:12,000  -->  00:00:14,050
And the G-G plot 2 package.

4

00:00:14,160  -->  00:00:19,750
We're going to first start off with installing Gigia plot to will also install a dataset with related

5

00:00:19,750  -->  00:00:23,030
the Gilia plot to called a cheesy plot to movies dataset.

6

00:00:23,160  -->  00:00:27,390
And before we actually start coding anything I'm going to show you a great cheat sheet resource that

7

00:00:27,420  -->  00:00:30,920
our studio provides for you for work and of G-G plot 2.

8

00:00:31,180  -->  00:00:31,830
OK.

9

00:00:31,860  -->  00:00:33,360
I'm super excited to show you all this.

10

00:00:33,360  -->  00:00:35,650
So let's go ahead and jump to our studio.

11

00:00:36,300  -->  00:00:38,220
OK so here we are our studio.

12

00:00:38,310  -->  00:00:41,300
Let's go ahead and start off by installing the packages we need.

13

00:00:41,760  -->  00:00:44,310
You're going to need to install G-G plot 2.

14

00:00:44,370  -->  00:00:49,670
So the start off will just go to Head and in the console you can say installed packages in quotes.

15

00:00:49,680  -->  00:00:52,880
Go ahead and pass G-G plot 2.

16

00:00:52,890  -->  00:00:58,110
That should take a little while to dollar install so I'm going to go ahead and fast forward and jump

17

00:00:58,110  -->  00:01:00,080
to when it's done installing.

18

00:01:00,090  -->  00:01:01,740
Gonna go ahead jump now.

19

00:01:02,290  -->  00:01:03,990
OK so it's finished installing.

20

00:01:03,990  -->  00:01:10,210
Second thing we're going to need to do is go ahead and just copy and paste the slide and common to appear

21

00:01:10,260  -->  00:01:12,120
in the script in case you need to reference it.

22

00:01:12,120  -->  00:01:14,760
It's also in the notes.

23

00:01:14,760  -->  00:01:20,340
Second thing I want to say is installed up packages and I'm going to go ahead and say cheesy plot to

24

00:01:21,450  -->  00:01:22,260
movies

25

00:01:25,080  -->  00:01:30,030
and that's going to go ahead and install the data set that we're gonna be working with.

26

00:01:30,110  -->  00:01:30,330
Right.

27

00:01:30,330  -->  00:01:31,160
That one's done.

28

00:01:31,200  -->  00:01:36,240
Going to go ahead and copy and paste it as a comment appear in the scripts.

29

00:01:36,240  -->  00:01:39,770
You can go ahead and positivity references if you need it.

30

00:01:40,680  -->  00:01:47,550
OK so before we get started on actually coding out a histogram what I want to show you is jump to my

31

00:01:47,550  -->  00:01:53,580
browser or your favorite browser real quick and find a cheat sheet that's going to be super useful for

32

00:01:53,580  -->  00:01:55,340
working of cheesy plot too.

33

00:01:55,860  -->  00:01:58,270
I'm going to go ahead and jump to the browser now.

34

00:01:58,740  -->  00:02:02,810
OK so I'm here in my browser and I went ahead and google searched our studio.

35

00:02:02,810  -->  00:02:04,930
Geez you plot cheat sheet.

36

00:02:04,930  -->  00:02:06,810
So I'm zoomed in right now on the results.

37

00:02:06,810  -->  00:02:13,470
But if you just google our studio use you plot cheat sheet the first link here should be the Ju-Ju plot

38

00:02:13,470  -->  00:02:16,140
to cheat sheet developed by our studio.

39

00:02:16,530  -->  00:02:20,370
So not that our studio developed just a plot to but that they created this cheat sheet.

40

00:02:20,370  -->  00:02:22,950
Although Hadley Wickham does actually work for our studio.

41

00:02:22,950  -->  00:02:24,570
So keep that in mind.

42

00:02:24,790  -->  00:02:30,540
Anyway as we go ahead and jump to the cheat sheet we have a wonderful PTF cheat sheet to work with as

43

00:02:30,540  -->  00:02:35,790
far as the different varieties of plots we can make with cheesy plot too.

44

00:02:36,090  -->  00:02:42,990
And it gives you a couple of nice formulas to follow as far as creating your plots.

45

00:02:43,200  -->  00:02:49,080
We won't have enough time to go over every single one of these plot types but we will go over enough

46

00:02:49,170  -->  00:02:54,300
plot types where you can eventually just reference's cheat sheet or even the documentation or plot types

47

00:02:54,300  -->  00:02:57,890
that you're looking for and know immediately how to create them.

48

00:02:58,560  -->  00:03:03,700
OK so first thing we're going to do is a histogram.

49

00:03:03,750  -->  00:03:09,580
So if we look throughout this cheat sheet right here we can see that we have a histogram method.

50

00:03:09,580  -->  00:03:15,770
So if I go ahead and zoom in a bit Lotusphere center screen we have Jiya underscore histogram.

51

00:03:15,930  -->  00:03:21,220
So our data and Ã¦sthetics layers are going to be really similar almost every single time.

52

00:03:21,240  -->  00:03:25,920
We'll either have an X or an X and Y depending on what kind of plot we want to create.

53

00:03:25,950  -->  00:03:30,520
But then after that we're really going to have to decide on is what kind of geometry layer we want.

54

00:03:30,650  -->  00:03:32,540
And in this case you're probably reference's cheat.

55

00:03:32,610  -->  00:03:36,360
Or the documentation and find the geometry layer that you're looking for.

56

00:03:36,360  -->  00:03:41,590
And they have a nice little mini visualization here so you can reference like oh yes I want a histogram

57

00:03:41,590  -->  00:03:44,020
since I'm looking for some sort of frequency plot.

58

00:03:44,490  -->  00:03:45,050
OK.

59

00:03:45,180  -->  00:03:47,500
Let's go ahead and jump back to our studio again.

60

00:03:47,500  -->  00:03:53,160
Mix it down his cheat sheet and reference it and I'm going to go ahead jump back to our studio and let's

61

00:03:53,160  -->  00:03:55,310
start plotting our history.

62

00:03:56,010  -->  00:03:58,140
OK we made it back to our studio.

63

00:03:58,170  -->  00:04:02,770
First thing we're going to do is call in the libraries and when I need G.G. plot too.

64

00:04:02,820  -->  00:04:10,080
And then for the dataset I'm going to need a library to plot two movies.

65

00:04:10,080  -->  00:04:12,930
Again there's no quotes it's recalling a library here.

66

00:04:12,960  -->  00:04:18,690
Just keep that in mind first layer that we're going to create in our grammar of graphics philosophy

67

00:04:19,230  -->  00:04:23,560
is the data layer and then the aesthetics layer.

68

00:04:24,090  -->  00:04:28,740
So data and aesthetics is what we're going to look for right now.

69

00:04:28,740  -->  00:04:35,830
So we start off by saying G-G plot and then the first thing we're going to do is pass in our data.

70

00:04:35,940  -->  00:04:39,310
Now our data is going to be movies.

71

00:04:39,360  -->  00:04:43,960
Movies is a data frame that comes with this Ju-Ju plot.

72

00:04:44,070  -->  00:04:49,830
Two movies can go ahead and just put movies there or you can assign movies to ADF or some different

73

00:04:49,890  -->  00:04:52,210
variable and pass in the variable here.

74

00:04:52,240  -->  00:04:57,840
In this case we're just going to say movies nor for this to work you have to install and call it the

75

00:04:57,840  -->  00:04:59,950
DZIEDZIC plot to movies dataset.

76

00:05:00,360  -->  00:05:03,180
Next thing you want to do is aesthetics.

77

00:05:03,210  -->  00:05:07,980
Now the syntax for aesthetics is a little strange because you're not adding it as a new layer.

78

00:05:07,980  -->  00:05:11,460
You're actually putting it into the initial plot function.

79

00:05:11,460  -->  00:05:18,570
So just keep that in mind and aesthetics is going to be whether you want X Y and what variables you

80

00:05:18,570  -->  00:05:19,990
want for x and y.

81

00:05:20,040  -->  00:05:24,960
So in order to get an idea of what we actually want to put in as aesthetics what I'm going to go ahead

82

00:05:24,960  -->  00:05:34,380
to do in the console call column names on my movies dataset just so I can get an idea of the movie's

83

00:05:34,660  -->  00:05:35,210
lips.

84

00:05:35,250  -->  00:05:42,090
And the first thing I have to do like I mentioned before is actually call cheesy plot to movies.

85

00:05:42,090  -->  00:05:46,400
The reason I have to call in the cancels because actually I haven't read the script yet.

86

00:05:46,570  -->  00:05:46,820
OK.

87

00:05:46,830  -->  00:05:49,250
So I call that now let's try that again.

88

00:05:49,260  -->  00:05:49,630
All right.

89

00:05:49,680  -->  00:05:52,750
So calling all the column names off of movies.

90

00:05:53,070  -->  00:05:57,050
I have the title of a movie the year the length rating et cetera.

91

00:05:57,300  -->  00:06:02,530
Let's go ahead and call head of movies.

92

00:06:02,820  -->  00:06:04,880
Take a look at this.

93

00:06:04,890  -->  00:06:09,560
So notice I have the title of the movie Sacha's $1000 touchdown or something.

94

00:06:09,560  -->  00:06:16,860
Twenty one day once a month the center a climax show I have years that they came out the length of the

95

00:06:16,860  -->  00:06:20,960
movie budgets a movie in this case a lot of these have Knolles.

96

00:06:20,960  -->  00:06:24,390
They're the rating of a movie might be an interesting one for histogram.

97

00:06:24,390  -->  00:06:27,370
So you can see kind of the frequency of ratings.

98

00:06:27,510  -->  00:06:29,750
So I have my ratings column.

99

00:06:29,790  -->  00:06:35,470
Let's go ahead and build the histogram off of the ratings column then go ahead and clear the console

100

00:06:35,470  -->  00:06:37,620
so we can continue working.

101

00:06:37,620  -->  00:06:42,380
So this case I'll say X equals rating.

102

00:06:42,660  -->  00:06:43,400
I won't pass it.

103

00:06:43,390  -->  00:06:43,980
Why.

104

00:06:44,010  -->  00:06:50,430
Because if histograms were just going to plot out the frequency of a single feature or variable or column

105

00:06:50,550  -->  00:06:57,690
in our data frame and in order to really put the idea of the layers of the grammar of graphics to good

106

00:06:57,690  -->  00:07:03,460
use I'm going to assign this to P.L. variable.

107

00:07:03,840  -->  00:07:09,360
So I have my state unaesthetic Slayer and then going to add in my geometries layer

108

00:07:12,030  -->  00:07:16,510
geometry and then that layer will be P.L. plus G.

109

00:07:16,800  -->  00:07:17,820
Underscore.

110

00:07:17,990  -->  00:07:24,430
And if he just type GM underscore our studio is going to show you all your options for geometries.

111

00:07:24,450  -->  00:07:26,530
There are a ton of options here.

112

00:07:26,580  -->  00:07:33,750
So usually you have to either in your help search for Gian and you'll get a result that looks like this

113

00:07:33,750  -->  00:07:33,800
.

114

00:07:33,840  -->  00:07:39,300
And you can go ahead and check out descriptions of each of these geometry layers or you can reference

115

00:07:39,300  -->  00:07:42,880
that cheat sheet that I showed you earlier it's good jump to it real quick.

116

00:07:43,110  -->  00:07:49,080
So here's a cheat sheet I showed earlier and what you would do is kind of look around and say OK I have

117

00:07:49,080  -->  00:07:51,170
one variable that I'm trying to plot.

118

00:07:51,240  -->  00:07:53,880
It's a continuous variable because it's a rating.

119

00:07:53,880  -->  00:07:57,690
So the ratings go from let's say zero to 10 continuously.

120

00:07:57,690  -->  00:07:59,540
And I want to create a histogram.

121

00:07:59,550  -->  00:08:04,500
So then I want to create a plot that looks like this and you figure out oh I need to do Jiya underscore

122

00:08:04,500  -->  00:08:05,760
histogram.

123

00:08:05,760  -->  00:08:11,460
Don't worry if you don't totally understand that yet as we go over more and more of these examples you'll

124

00:08:11,460  -->  00:08:16,230
start to get really familiar as far as using this cheat sheet or the documentation to figure out what

125

00:08:16,230  -->  00:08:18,090
geometry layer to call.

126

00:08:18,720  -->  00:08:19,210
OK.

127

00:08:19,350  -->  00:08:23,490
So we decided we'll call a GM underscore histogram as our geometry layer.

128

00:08:23,520  -->  00:08:26,680
Let's jump back to our studio here our studio.

129

00:08:26,700  -->  00:08:29,670
I'm going to go ahead and call a histogram.

130

00:08:29,730  -->  00:08:31,870
I won't pass any additional arguments in the history.

131

00:08:31,890  -->  00:08:39,900
For now let's go ahead and run the source here and if we go ahead and go to plot's you'll notice nothing

132

00:08:39,900  -->  00:08:41,760
actually comes out.

133

00:08:41,880  -->  00:08:46,910
Reason for that being that you have to actually print out whatever you actually want to plot.

134

00:08:46,920  -->  00:08:48,170
In this case I want to say.

135

00:08:48,270  -->  00:08:52,710
Plus GM histogram print that out is going to run source again.

136

00:08:53,250  -->  00:08:54,740
And now we actually do get the plot.

137

00:08:54,750  -->  00:08:58,550
So this is what the very basics of a histogram look like.

138

00:08:58,590  -->  00:09:05,070
We have a continuous one variable plot that goes from zero to 10 and we have a histogram which is just

139

00:09:05,130  -->  00:09:13,800
the counts so essentially showing the frequency of these ratings so we have maybe around 2000 ish counts

140

00:09:13,900  -->  00:09:17,560
of I don't know seven point six ish ratings.

141

00:09:17,670  -->  00:09:21,130
So the most common rating is around a six.

142

00:09:21,180  -->  00:09:26,940
Now we can see that the least common orating are either zeros or it tends to make sense you don't have

143

00:09:27,270  -->  00:09:32,180
perfect movies you don't have that many super awful movies.

144

00:09:32,250  -->  00:09:38,570
Now we can begin to add arguments into our geometry layer in order to customize our plot.

145

00:09:38,610  -->  00:09:45,090
So if we take a quick peek again at that cheat sheet or jump to it now we see we have additional arguments

146

00:09:45,090  -->  00:09:46,590
such as been with.

147

00:09:46,690  -->  00:09:47,600
Sorry about that.

148

00:09:47,730  -->  00:09:49,820
We had been with equals five.

149

00:09:49,830  -->  00:09:58,590
Maybe that's default etc that we can use x y Alpha color fill line type size weight etc. So we're going

150

00:09:58,590  -->  00:10:03,420
to go ahead and do is play around with some of these extra geometry arguments and see how they affect

151

00:10:03,420  -->  00:10:04,520
our plot.

152

00:10:05,040  -->  00:10:07,500
Let's go in and jump back to our studio.

153

00:10:07,560  -->  00:10:13,170
Notice in our studio when we actually printed out this plot we got a little statement here that sets

154

00:10:13,170  -->  00:10:18,000
that been using Ben's equals 30 pick better value with bin with.

155

00:10:18,020  -->  00:10:24,330
Now what that basically means is you can edit the width of these bins if you want to get more granular

156

00:10:24,330  -->  00:10:27,080
information on these counts.

157

00:10:27,150  -->  00:10:29,650
So we're going to go ahead and do just that.

158

00:10:29,850  -->  00:10:35,610
I'm going to add the argument been with and we know that's an argument because we checked out that cheat

159

00:10:35,610  -->  00:10:40,510
sheet and let's go ahead and say 0.1.

160

00:10:40,560  -->  00:10:43,720
So that means I want every been in my plot.

161

00:10:43,760  -->  00:10:49,760
So you have a width of 0.1 units and the unit in this case is rating.

162

00:10:49,770  -->  00:10:55,020
Now let's go ahead and run the source and I can see I have a lot more Bins.

163

00:10:55,040  -->  00:10:57,600
So now my information is actually clear.

164

00:10:57,690  -->  00:11:00,450
Then last time last time we had 30 bins.

165

00:11:00,530  -->  00:11:05,270
Now I can get a little more granular on that information of the history I'm going to get a better picture

166

00:11:05,270  -->  00:11:07,900
of what's actually going on.

167

00:11:07,940  -->  00:11:13,940
We can also begin to add things such as color and fill arguments into our geometry layer.

168

00:11:13,940  -->  00:11:15,640
So let's go ahead and try doing that.

169

00:11:15,650  -->  00:11:16,890
We had it been with.

170

00:11:17,240  -->  00:11:22,550
If I say color equals I can pass in a string of basic colors.

171

00:11:22,550  -->  00:11:25,880
So for instance I can say color equals red.

172

00:11:26,090  -->  00:11:28,310
Let's go ahead and run that source.

173

00:11:28,580  -->  00:11:35,000
And now you'll notice if you can make it out that each of the outside lines of this histogram is colored

174

00:11:35,150  -->  00:11:35,870
red.

175

00:11:36,020  -->  00:11:41,340
If you actually want to affect the fill color of this histogram you'll have to pass in fill.

176

00:11:41,750  -->  00:11:44,300
So let's go ahead and add that in.

177

00:11:44,780  -->  00:11:46,480
We might go to another line here.

178

00:11:46,490  -->  00:11:50,210
So we'll say fill equals.

179

00:11:50,300  -->  00:11:58,570
Let's go ahead and say pink and then make sure we have enough parentheses go ahead and run this.

180

00:11:59,000  -->  00:12:04,460
And now we have a red outline for our color and our fill is pink.

181

00:12:05,090  -->  00:12:08,410
So there's tons of arguments and keep adding to this geometry layer.

182

00:12:08,450  -->  00:12:10,390
I'll show you one more common one.

183

00:12:10,700  -->  00:12:15,390
And that's Alpha what the alpha argument allows us to do.

184

00:12:15,430  -->  00:12:16,740
So all the way here on the right.

185

00:12:17,060  -->  00:12:22,430
But what it allows us to do is set the transparency of our plotted data.

186

00:12:22,490  -->  00:12:28,610
So if I set our foot equal to zero that means it's fully transparent.

187

00:12:28,610  -->  00:12:30,740
So you see there's no more fill there.

188

00:12:30,740  -->  00:12:36,090
If I set it to 1 which is essentially the default that means it's totally opaque.

189

00:12:36,260  -->  00:12:40,480
So I can't make out the lines those grid lines behind the plot.

190

00:12:40,640  -->  00:12:42,880
So actually I want to try to make out those grid lines.

191

00:12:42,890  -->  00:12:51,440
I'll say something like 0.4 and now I can kind of both see the fill and the grid lines so that's Alpha

192

00:12:51,470  -->  00:12:52,840
for transparency.

193

00:12:53,120  -->  00:12:58,310
So these are going to be really common arguments with a histogram you'll probably specify the bin with

194

00:12:58,370  -->  00:13:02,990
the color fill and then maybe some sort of transparency.

195

00:13:02,990  -->  00:13:05,320
Now let's talk about adding labels.

196

00:13:05,320  -->  00:13:07,020
So adding some more layers.

197

00:13:07,070  -->  00:13:14,520
I'm going to go ahead and do is assign all of this to peel too.

198

00:13:14,720  -->  00:13:19,580
So we have a geometry layer and then I'm going to say that line is getting kind of long.

199

00:13:19,610  -->  00:13:23,080
I'll start adding stuff to appeal to for printing purposes.

200

00:13:23,270  -->  00:13:27,340
So we get peeled to add in them to go ahead and add labels to this plot.

201

00:13:27,560  -->  00:13:33,950
So right now the labels are defaulted to count and rading count because it's counting the number of

202

00:13:33,950  -->  00:13:35,810
times each of these ratings show up.

203

00:13:35,810  -->  00:13:38,630
And this rating is just because that was the name of the column.

204

00:13:38,810  -->  00:13:44,960
We said X equals rating but let's say we actually wanted to set our own x labels and y labels maybe

205

00:13:44,960  -->  00:13:46,310
even titles.

206

00:13:46,310  -->  00:13:53,370
The arguments are going to add and this kind of goes with the coordinates or facets kind of layer.

207

00:13:53,480  -->  00:14:00,470
We're going to say X L A B parentheses and then pass in a string of whatever you want the X label to

208

00:14:00,470  -->  00:14:01,040
be.

209

00:14:01,280  -->  00:14:06,890
So this case let's go ahead of person move the rating.

210

00:14:07,910  -->  00:14:13,400
And then for y label it's going to be really similar are you going to say plus y L.A. B.

211

00:14:13,610  -->  00:14:15,110
And then we're going to go ahead and say

212

00:14:18,680  -->  00:14:24,180
well just say count to the capital C since that's essentially still what it is.

213

00:14:24,410  -->  00:14:27,920
And now it's a sign all of this to P.L. three.

214

00:14:28,820  -->  00:14:31,460
And then Prince P.L. three.

215

00:14:31,490  -->  00:14:35,920
And the reason of doing all these assignments is just so you can easily read this.

216

00:14:35,940  -->  00:14:38,030
So have data and aesthetics.

217

00:14:38,030  -->  00:14:43,490
We go ahead and play around for geometry till we get something that looks nice to us and then we go

218

00:14:43,490  -->  00:14:46,400
ahead and add X labels and y labels.

219

00:14:46,460  -->  00:14:49,730
Let's try running the source see what it looks like.

220

00:14:49,820  -->  00:14:51,680
I have an error.

221

00:14:51,800  -->  00:14:54,280
Looks like I accidentally added a parentheses here.

222

00:14:54,290  -->  00:14:56,960
Let me go in and remove that.

223

00:14:59,120  -->  00:14:59,480
OK.

224

00:14:59,480  -->  00:15:02,600
Now let's run from source.

225

00:15:02,660  -->  00:15:03,580
There we go.

226

00:15:03,590  -->  00:15:09,740
So if you can make it out here this access has been changed to a movie rating and the y axis is capital

227

00:15:09,740  -->  00:15:10,340
C count.

228

00:15:10,340  -->  00:15:15,700
Now just to show that it's really clear we'll go at it say my counts case.

229

00:15:15,700  -->  00:15:18,950
It's too small c can probably see if I add two words there.

230

00:15:18,980  -->  00:15:19,490
Run it.

231

00:15:19,490  -->  00:15:21,520
Now I can see we have my counts.

232

00:15:21,920  -->  00:15:25,860
OK we have a nice plot we have our own x label or on y label.

233

00:15:25,910  -->  00:15:28,780
Let's just add a title to this plot.

234

00:15:28,850  -->  00:15:34,460
So maybe you want an overall title appear on top of the plot the way you can do that is by adding G-G

235

00:15:35,120  -->  00:15:37,610
title and then just passing a string.

236

00:15:37,670  -->  00:15:39,290
I'll go ahead and just put in all caps.

237

00:15:39,290  -->  00:15:42,710
My title run the source here.

238

00:15:43,150  -->  00:15:48,440
And once the source is done running we can see my title has popped up in this new plot.

239

00:15:48,500  -->  00:15:53,570
You can go ahead and go back and forth between your old plots by clicking on these arrows.

240

00:15:53,580  -->  00:15:56,220
So just keep that in mind.

241

00:15:56,240  -->  00:16:00,140
Finally let me go ahead and show you how you can actually save these plots.

242

00:16:00,260  -->  00:16:06,050
So once you have a plot that you like you go ahead and click here on export and you can save this image

243

00:16:06,090  -->  00:16:09,130
save us PDAF or copy to the clipboard.

244

00:16:09,140  -->  00:16:14,990
This means if you are working with maybe some Excel data you just imported into our one to make a nice

245

00:16:14,990  -->  00:16:20,680
custom plot in R and then maybe paste it back into a Word document or an Excel document.

246

00:16:20,690  -->  00:16:25,310
You can either save it as an image save as a PDA or actually just straight copy to your clipboard and

247

00:16:25,310  -->  00:16:27,940
then paste it into whatever document you're working in.

248

00:16:28,130  -->  00:16:33,530
So you have some three options that are really nice free to work with and you can go ahead and clean

249

00:16:33,530  -->  00:16:38,780
up your history of plots by clicking on this room here.

250

00:16:38,870  -->  00:16:40,850
All right so what have we learned so far.

251

00:16:40,850  -->  00:16:46,540
We learn how to create a basic plot which you plot the ever data and esthetics layer.

252

00:16:46,550  -->  00:16:48,120
Then we have our geometry layer.

253

00:16:48,140  -->  00:16:50,220
Again how do we find that geometry layer.

254

00:16:50,390  -->  00:16:54,320
Well you can either reference the documentation or you can search that cheat sheet that I showed you

255

00:16:54,350  -->  00:16:55,230
earlier.

256

00:16:55,370  -->  00:17:00,290
We added some additional arguments to play around of her geometry layer including things such as color

257

00:17:00,380  -->  00:17:08,000
fill Alpha for transparency and then we went ahead and added some x labels of X lab a y label y lab

258

00:17:08,360  -->  00:17:11,720
and then a title of G-G title.

259

00:17:12,170  -->  00:17:17,870
All right before we completely finished this lecture I just want to show you in advance Ã¦sthetics technique

260

00:17:18,250  -->  00:17:25,340
that you can actually apply to the geometry layer in order to fill out your histogram based on the counts

261

00:17:25,370  -->  00:17:28,430
or occurrence number of your y axis.

262

00:17:28,430  -->  00:17:29,420
In this case.

263

00:17:29,530  -->  00:17:31,660
So don't worry if you don't fully understand the syntax.

264

00:17:31,670  -->  00:17:36,890
But I just want to see what's possible of cheesy plot and how cool it is going to go and come back here

265

00:17:36,890  -->  00:17:47,520
to my geometer score histogram and I'm going to add h e s is going to affect the fill of the geometry

266

00:17:47,550  -->  00:17:56,600
layer so I'll say Ã¦sthetics fill dot dot count dot dot and this kind of a special way to fill out the

267

00:17:56,600  -->  00:18:02,230
color of your histogram based on the counts of the histogram.

268

00:18:02,270  -->  00:18:06,020
So let's go ahead and run this from the source.

269

00:18:06,130  -->  00:18:13,310
Now you'll notice that as my count gets higher here my blue color becomes lighter and as the count is

270

00:18:13,310  -->  00:18:16,240
lower the blue color becomes darker.

271

00:18:16,400  -->  00:18:18,500
So that's kind of a more advanced technique.

272

00:18:18,500  -->  00:18:22,040
Don't worry if you don't fully understand this we'll go over these more advanced aesthetic techniques

273

00:18:22,100  -->  00:18:29,080
later but hopefully you can see now just how powerful G-G plot is to make some really cool looking plots

274

00:18:29,100  -->  00:18:29,330
.

275

00:18:29,550  -->  00:18:34,820
OK this advanced technique is also in the notes in case you want to reference the code for it.

276

00:18:34,820  -->  00:18:36,980
Thanks everyone and I'll see at the next lecture
