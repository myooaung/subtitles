00:00:00.450  -->  00:00:05.610
Hello everyone and welcome to the functions training exercise lecture and this lecture we're going to

2

00:00:05.610  -->  00:00:09.660
get a brief overview of the training exercise for the functions lecture.

3

00:00:09.720  -->  00:00:11.810
Let's go ahead and jump to the notebook.

4

00:00:12.150  -->  00:00:12.480
All right.

5

00:00:12.480  -->  00:00:14.140
Here I am at the notebook.

6

00:00:14.310  -->  00:00:19.200
And in this note book which is going to test your knowledge of how to create functions in our some of

7

00:00:19.200  -->  00:00:21.910
these are going to be a little tricky so take your time with them.

8

00:00:22.050  -->  00:00:27.840
The first two examples I'm going to walk through right now an example number one the assignment is to

9

00:00:27.840  -->  00:00:33.450
create a function that takes in a name as a string argument and prints out hello and then space the

10

00:00:33.450  -->  00:00:36.000
name in this function.

11

00:00:36.000  -->  00:00:40.600
All I had to do is say hello you assign function the input is name.

12

00:00:40.740  -->  00:00:45.630
And then I said prints and I use the paste function to paste together these two strings.

13

00:00:45.630  -->  00:00:46.320
Hello.

14

00:00:46.470  -->  00:00:48.590
And then the input string name.

15

00:00:48.680  -->  00:00:49.620
And that means when I call.

16

00:00:49.620  -->  00:00:51.400
Hello underscore you Sam.

17

00:00:51.560  -->  00:00:53.720
I get as an output the printed statement.

18

00:00:53.820  -->  00:00:55.740
Hello Sam.

19

00:00:55.920  -->  00:01:01.440
Example Number two is create a function that takes in the names a string argument and returns a string

20

00:01:01.440  -->  00:01:02.060
of the form.

21

00:01:02.060  -->  00:01:02.970
Hello name.

22

00:01:02.970  -->  00:01:04.290
Note the difference here.

23

00:01:04.290  -->  00:01:07.440
Example one asks for the printed out statement.

24

00:01:07.530  -->  00:01:08.790
Hello name.

25

00:01:08.790  -->  00:01:11.900
Example 2 asks you to return a string of the form.

26

00:01:11.900  -->  00:01:18.160
Hello name meaning you're going to use the return keyword and that means you can actually set Hello

27

00:01:18.170  -->  00:01:19.150
you.

28

00:01:19.440  -->  00:01:24.170
To another variable and it will return the string Hello name.

29

00:01:24.210  -->  00:01:29.160
So just keep that in mind the difference between printing out the solution versus actually returning

30

00:01:29.160  -->  00:01:31.240
the solution.

31

00:01:31.260  -->  00:01:35.790
Then go ahead and just walk through the rest of these exercises such as creating a function that will

32

00:01:35.790  -->  00:01:38.700
return the product of two integers etc..

33

00:01:38.730  -->  00:01:40.050
Just go ahead and scroll down.

34

00:01:40.110  -->  00:01:44.250
Example outputs of what it should look like when accepting certain arguments.

35

00:01:44.250  -->  00:01:52.590
Example for an example or exercise exercise for an exercise 5 are a little trickier an exercise 6 is

36

00:01:52.590  -->  00:01:54.330
also a little tricky.

37

00:01:54.330  -->  00:01:56.310
Keep that in mind take your time with them.

38

00:01:56.310  -->  00:02:01.060
There are little more on the computer science side than just understanding how functions work.

39

00:02:01.110  -->  00:02:06.210
So take your time with them and approach the solutions and the notebook for the solutions in case you

40

00:02:06.210  -->  00:02:08.070
need any hints or tips.

41

00:02:08.070  -->  00:02:12.900
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture where we'll be doing a full walk of all the solutions

42

00:02:12.900  -->  00:02:14.350
to these exercises.
