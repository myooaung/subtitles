Hello everyone.

2

00:00:06,510  -->  00:00:11,400
Welcome to the advanced our programming section of this course and this section of the course we're

3

00:00:11,400  -->  00:00:16,680
going to be going over some unique are functions and features that you can use to your advantage when

4

00:00:16,680  -->  00:00:18,430
you're programming with our.

5

00:00:18,690  -->  00:00:21,120
We've already gone over the basics of programming.

6

00:00:21,300  -->  00:00:26,100
And if you already have experience programming you could have just read the notebooks for that particular

7

00:00:26,100  -->  00:00:28,470
section for this section of the course.

8

00:00:28,500  -->  00:00:33,030
Even if you already have experience programming in other languages you should still check out the videos

9

00:00:33,030  -->  00:00:37,230
or at least go through the notebooks because everything we're going to be discussing is pretty unique

10

00:00:37,260  -->  00:00:38,310
to our.

11

00:00:38,550  -->  00:00:44,820
We're going to talk about built in our features the Apply function math functions of our regular expressions

12

00:00:44,820  -->  00:00:45,430
with our.

13

00:00:45,480  -->  00:00:49,380
And then how to do of date and time stamp information with our.

14

00:00:49,410  -->  00:00:50,370
All right.

15

00:00:50,370  -->  00:00:52,410
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
