00:00:00,420  -->  00:00:06,230
Hello everyone and welcome to the lecture on factor in categorical matrices this lecture we're going

2

00:00:06,230  -->  00:00:09,850
to look at how to create factor in categorical matrices in our.

3

00:00:10,050  -->  00:00:13,140
Let's go ahead and jump to our studio to get started.

4

00:00:13,140  -->  00:00:15,300
All right so here here our studio.

5

00:00:15,480  -->  00:00:20,520
And in this lecture we're mainly going to be discussing the factor function and it's used for creating

6

00:00:20,520  -->  00:00:22,210
categorical matrices.

7

00:00:22,470  -->  00:00:27,510
This specific function will become really useful when we begin to apply data analysis and machine learning

8

00:00:27,510  -->  00:00:29,210
techniques to our data.

9

00:00:29,220  -->  00:00:32,160
This is also sometimes and then is creating dummy variables.

10

00:00:32,160  -->  00:00:35,630
So you may be familiar with it in that context.

11

00:00:35,670  -->  00:00:40,230
So let's go to start by show an example of why and how we can build a sort of matrix.

12

00:00:40,390  -->  00:00:50,580
I want to go ahead and create a vector called Animal Nalut just go ahead and pretend that where have

13

00:00:50,580  -->  00:00:52,120
some sort of animal sanctuary.

14

00:00:52,130  -->  00:00:54,040
And there's dogs and cats in it.

15

00:00:54,090  -->  00:00:59,090
So we'll go ahead and just label this the C for cat D for dog.

16

00:00:59,340  -->  00:01:07,180
Let's go ahead and put another dog in there and then we'll start with two more cats.

17

00:01:07,180  -->  00:01:07,870
All right.

18

00:01:08,160  -->  00:01:11,690
So we have our animal vector where C is for cat D is for dog.

19

00:01:11,700  -->  00:01:16,890
And so we're trying to represent some sort of animal sanctuary and let's say each of these specific

20

00:01:16,890  -->  00:01:20,320
animals also has a corresponding ID number.

21

00:01:20,430  -->  00:01:23,440
So we'll go ahead and make an ID number vector.

22

00:01:23,970  -->  00:01:29,130
Know let's just go ahead and say One two three four five.

23

00:01:29,130  -->  00:01:34,440
All right so we have our animals in Adie's and we want to convert the animal vector into information

24

00:01:34,440  -->  00:01:40,260
that an algorithm or equation can understand more easily meaning we want to begin to check how many

25

00:01:40,260  -->  00:01:45,030
categories or factor levels are actually in our character vector.

26

00:01:45,330  -->  00:01:51,600
So we can do is we can pass the vector through the factor function like this.

27

00:01:51,600  -->  00:01:54,230
So we're going to go in and say factor.

28

00:01:55,080  -->  00:02:00,470
And so then notice I'm going to go ahead and pass an animal.

29

00:02:00,810  -->  00:02:07,980
And so what you get back is this vector that also notice that it has these levels attached to it C and

30

00:02:07,980  -->  00:02:08,790
D.

31

00:02:08,850  -->  00:02:16,470
So I'm going to go ahead and assign this factor of animal and I'll assign it to let's just go ahead

32

00:02:16,470  -->  00:02:22,180
and say fact Annie as some variable name for this.

33

00:02:22,320  -->  00:02:24,580
So we're going to save that factor.

34

00:02:24,690  -->  00:02:25,250
All right.

35

00:02:25,410  -->  00:02:29,340
So we can see that we have two levels D-N.C. for dog and cat.

36

00:02:29,610  -->  00:02:34,310
So in our There's going to be two distinct types of categorical variables.

37

00:02:34,380  -->  00:02:38,670
There's going to be ordinal categorical variables in nominal categorical variables.

38

00:02:38,790  -->  00:02:42,780
So the nominal categorical variables let me go in and type this out.

39

00:02:42,780  -->  00:02:44,540
You can also reference the notes for this.

40

00:02:44,770  -->  00:02:50,310
So right now we're talking about nominal must go ahead and make that a little brighter by not putting

41

00:02:50,310  -->  00:02:51,660
it as a comment.

42

00:02:51,660  -->  00:02:55,230
So the nominal categorical variables don't have any order.

43

00:02:55,350  -->  00:02:57,180
So you can imagine that dogs and cats.

44

00:02:57,180  -->  00:02:59,480
There's no order to them.

45

00:02:59,520  -->  00:03:06,570
Well some people may prefer dogs for cats but in reality there's no order to them versus ordinal categorical

46

00:03:06,570  -->  00:03:08,370
variables as the name implies.

47

00:03:08,400  -->  00:03:18,420
Do have some sort of order so we can think of nominal there's no order versus let's go ahead and say

48

00:03:20,160  -->  00:03:24,660
ordinal there is an order.

49

00:03:24,750  -->  00:03:27,690
So nominal an example that is what we have here.

50

00:03:27,840  -->  00:03:34,770
This animal so there's no order versus dogs and cats but something that could be ordinal of order could

51

00:03:34,770  -->  00:03:44,970
be something like temperatures so we could have something like or Dohm cat with let's say cold

52

00:03:48,300  -->  00:03:51,890
medium and hot.

53

00:03:51,960  -->  00:03:59,700
So this is a ordinal categorical variable because even though we're dealing with strings here and different

54

00:03:59,700  -->  00:04:01,080
categories.

55

00:04:01,080  -->  00:04:05,910
So cold is a category medium is a category of temperature hot as category temperature.

56

00:04:05,910  -->  00:04:07,620
You can see that there's an order to them.

57

00:04:07,650  -->  00:04:11,280
It should be cold medium hot versus dogs and cats.

58

00:04:11,310  -->  00:04:14,690
So Dog is a category C is a category for cat.

59

00:04:14,850  -->  00:04:19,470
There's no order of dogs before cats are cast before dogs.

60

00:04:19,470  -->  00:04:20,150
OK.

61

00:04:20,640  -->  00:04:27,120
So if you actually want to assign an order to these variables you would be able to do that while using

62

00:04:27,120  -->  00:04:28,250
the factor function.

63

00:04:28,290  -->  00:04:34,680
And you can actually pass in an argument with ordered equals true and pass in the levels argument as

64

00:04:34,680  -->  00:04:34,990
well.

65

00:04:34,990  -->  00:04:37,510
So we're going to show you how we can do that.

66

00:04:37,560  -->  00:04:47,610
So let's say we have a vector temp's and it's going to be called Medium a high bigger than just copy

67

00:04:47,610  -->  00:04:49,170
and paste this.

68

00:04:49,290  -->  00:04:53,780
And we're also going to put in a couple of more instances so I'll say there's another instance of hot

69

00:04:53,830  -->  00:04:54,320
.

70

00:04:54,690  -->  00:04:58,320
Another instance of Ha we'll say there's another axis of cold.

71

00:04:58,590  -->  00:05:03,440
And finally one more instance of median.

72

00:05:03,820  -->  00:05:04,050
Right.

73

00:05:04,050  -->  00:05:06,820
So we have our attempts vector here.

74

00:05:06,840  -->  00:05:10,520
So it's caught cold medium hot ha hot cold medium.

75

00:05:10,540  -->  00:05:10,740
Right.

76

00:05:10,740  -->  00:05:12,670
So we have these three categories.

77

00:05:12,690  -->  00:05:23,340
Let's go ahead and pass this into a variable using factor and let me just bring this back up by clearing

78

00:05:23,340  -->  00:05:29,110
that I'm going to go ahead and say temp's is that vector of cold medium hot et cetera.

79

00:05:29,130  -->  00:05:39,780
Various instances and I'll say the factored version of this called The Factor function pass in my temps

80

00:05:39,860  -->  00:05:40,850
vector.

81

00:05:41,280  -->  00:05:45,750
I'm going to say ordered is equal to true.

82

00:05:45,780  -->  00:05:50,310
Remember I didn't do this for the dogs and cats vector because there was no order that made sense for

83

00:05:50,310  -->  00:05:52,150
dogs and cats in this case.

84

00:05:52,170  -->  00:05:53,730
There is an order that makes sense.

85

00:05:53,730  -->  00:05:55,830
It should be cold medium that hot.

86

00:05:55,950  -->  00:05:59,610
You could also do hot medium cold depending on which way you want it to think about it.

87

00:05:59,640  -->  00:06:07,050
This case will say cold comes first then medium than hot so I'll go ahead and add in the level's argument

88

00:06:07,560  -->  00:06:14,130
and the levels argument is going to take in a vector and you just pasan a vector of the order you want

89

00:06:15,030  -->  00:06:20,040
needs to be ordered it's going to say cold medium and then hot

90

00:06:23,000  -->  00:06:23,320
right.

91

00:06:23,370  -->  00:06:26,160
So we've assigned that factored version of that.

92

00:06:26,370  -->  00:06:32,420
Dr. chanels go ahead and see an idea of what this looks like by calling fact that temp.

93

00:06:32,460  -->  00:06:38,010
So notice the levels actually have an order to them and you can see it by the comparison operator in

94

00:06:38,010  -->  00:06:42,570
between the terms so cold is less than medium and medium is less than hot.

95

00:06:42,960  -->  00:06:48,750
OK so that's pretty useful and it's going to be really useful when we end up using the summary function

96

00:06:49,230  -->  00:06:53,540
to call a summary on that object.

97

00:06:54,660  -->  00:07:00,720
So I'll go ahead and tell us cold medium and hot and the various counts of how many times those appear

98

00:07:01,290  -->  00:07:08,550
and we can show you a summary of the original temps as well to show the difference between the factored

99

00:07:09,030  -->  00:07:13,920
version of that vector versus the summary of the original.

100

00:07:13,920  -->  00:07:14,610
All right.

101

00:07:14,610  -->  00:07:16,860
So that's it for this lecture.

102

00:07:16,890  -->  00:07:22,320
Don't stress out too much about understanding everything you've gone over here during this lecture.

103

00:07:22,350  -->  00:07:26,160
We're not going to touch back on this until quite a while from now.

104

00:07:26,310  -->  00:07:31,900
I just wanted you to be aware of it since it fits in well with the ideas of vectors and matrices.

105

00:07:31,920  -->  00:07:39,210
So the only thing you should be aware of are the use of the factor function as a possibility for you

106

00:07:39,210  -->  00:07:39,930
to use.

107

00:07:40,080  -->  00:07:47,890
And then the difference between a nominal category set versus an ordinal category set.

108

00:07:47,910  -->  00:07:53,520
OK so the nominal you have those cats and dogs are the order ordinal as the name implies there is an

109

00:07:53,550  -->  00:07:54,480
order to it.

110

00:07:54,480  -->  00:08:00,750
And you can specify that order using the factor function by saying order equals true and then specifying

111

00:08:00,780  -->  00:08:08,230
the levels as a vector and you just pasand the vector of the terms in indexed order that you want.

112

00:08:08,510  -->  00:08:10,920
OK that's it for this lecture.

113

00:08:10,920  -->  00:08:11,960
Thanks everyone.

114

00:08:12,000  -->  00:08:13,550
I'll see at the next lecture.
