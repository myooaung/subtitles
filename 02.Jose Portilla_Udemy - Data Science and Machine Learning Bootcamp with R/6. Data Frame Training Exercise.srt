Hello everyone and welcome to the our data frame's training exercise lecture and this lecture will just

2

00:00:11,130  -->  00:00:16,310
get a brief overview of the training exercise for the art data frames section of this course.

3

00:00:16,560  -->  00:00:20,650
Let's go ahead and jump to the data frame exercise notebook now.

4

00:00:20,730  -->  00:00:25,980
All right here we are at the our data frame's exercises notebook for this exercise we're just going

5

00:00:25,980  -->  00:00:28,710
to be testing your basic knowledge of data frames.

6

00:00:28,890  -->  00:00:33,030
You'll go head to just follow the exercise instructions that are in bold here below.

7

00:00:33,030  -->  00:00:37,830
For instance this first exercise you're shown the state of frame right here consisting of three rows

8

00:00:37,830  -->  00:00:38,870
and three columns.

9

00:00:39,010  -->  00:00:44,110
And I want you to recreate this following data frame by creating vectors and then using the data that

10

00:00:44,120  -->  00:00:49,680
frame function and passing in those factors in the correct manner then you'll go ahead and just keep

11

00:00:49,680  -->  00:00:54,420
performing other exercises to test your knowledge of data frames.

12

00:00:54,550  -->  00:00:57,330
OK that's it for this state of frame exercise.

13

00:00:57,330  -->  00:00:58,650
Go ahead and try it out.

14

00:00:58,650  -->  00:00:59,640
Best of luck.

15

00:00:59,690  -->  00:01:03,490
And then the next lecture will have a solutions through for this exercise.

16

00:01:03,510  -->  00:01:05,520
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture
