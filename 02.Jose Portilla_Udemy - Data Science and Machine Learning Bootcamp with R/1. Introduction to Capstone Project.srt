00:00:05,700  -->  00:00:11,100
Hello everyone and welcome to your capstone data project and this project we're going to be learning

2

00:00:11,130  -->  00:00:16,830
how to combine everything you've learned about your our programming skills and your data visualization

3

00:00:16,950  -->  00:00:20,980
as well as data frame operations in order to solve a real historical problem.

4

00:00:21,210  -->  00:00:24,780
And in this case it's going to be the famous Moneyball problem.

5

00:00:24,810  -->  00:00:29,760
Let's go ahead and jump to notebook to give you a little more background on the capstone data project

6

00:00:29,760  -->  00:00:30,000
.

7

00:00:30,000  -->  00:00:30,300
All right.

8

00:00:30,300  -->  00:00:31,980
Here I am at the notebook.

9

00:00:32,070  -->  00:00:37,050
The location of this notebook and all the images and cxxviii files associated with this notebook and

10

00:00:37,050  -->  00:00:40,920
its project is located under the training exercise folder.

11

00:00:40,920  -->  00:00:46,080
You should see another folder called capstone and Data Projects and then there's a folder called capstone

12

00:00:46,080  -->  00:00:47,010
project.

13

00:00:47,010  -->  00:00:51,990
And this actual notebook is called the Moneyball project notebook and it has a sister in a book called

14

00:00:52,000  -->  00:00:53,590
Moneyball project solutions.

15

00:00:53,710  -->  00:00:55,130
So check the solutions first.

16

00:00:55,300  -->  00:00:57,810
Actually try to attempt this project.

17

00:00:57,900  -->  00:01:01,020
Now you may be thinking I don't know anything about baseball or sports.

18

00:01:01,020  -->  00:01:02,820
How can I possibly do this project.

19

00:01:03,000  -->  00:01:06,760
Well don't worry you don't need to know too much about baseball to complete this exercise.

20

00:01:06,870  -->  00:01:11,640
If you're totally unfamiliar of baseball go ahead and check out the useful explanatory video that's

21

00:01:11,640  -->  00:01:13,350
linked in the notebook.

22

00:01:13,440  -->  00:01:19,650
You can just click here and that will take you to this video right here which just very simply explains

23

00:01:19,740  -->  00:01:20,930
the rules of baseball.

24

00:01:21,120  -->  00:01:24,120
And after watching this video it's quite sure it's only eight minutes long.

25

00:01:24,210  -->  00:01:28,710
You should know enough about baseball or actually more than enough to complete this project.

26

00:01:28,740  -->  00:01:30,210
So go ahead and check out this video.

27

00:01:30,210  -->  00:01:32,510
If you don't know anything about baseball.

28

00:01:33,510  -->  00:01:37,710
Once you watch that video or if you already know enough about baseball you can go ahead and start reading

29

00:01:37,710  -->  00:01:40,230
about the background of this project.

30

00:01:40,260  -->  00:01:47,430
The basic premise is that in 2001 the Oakland A's which is a baseball team in Oakland California saw

31

00:01:47,430  -->  00:01:52,350
the departure of three key players which were known as the lost boys and Billy Beane the team's general

32

00:01:52,350  -->  00:01:59,280
manager was able to use statistics in order to create a very good team with a very low salary budget

33

00:02:00,190  -->  00:02:05,700
and this story was made famous because of a book called Moneyball which was written by Michael Lewis

34

00:02:07,370  -->  00:02:10,150
and it was later turned into a movie starring Brad Pitt.

35

00:02:10,740  -->  00:02:15,510
And again the basic premise here as you can see from this chart here and highlighted in red is the Oakland

36

00:02:15,570  -->  00:02:23,040
A's and they have essentially the third lowest salary cap and total salary available for all other players

37

00:02:23,130  -->  00:02:28,360
versus everyone else in the Major League Baseball League.

38

00:02:28,650  -->  00:02:33,840
And what you're going to go out and do is using your skills and your G-G plot 2 skills in everything

39

00:02:33,840  -->  00:02:41,040
you've learned so far is basically help the Oakland A's to recruit undervalued players will be using

40

00:02:41,040  -->  00:02:43,440
data from this Web site right here.

41

00:02:43,440  -->  00:02:49,110
But this is actually already been downloaded for you and you have to see S V files a batting that see

42

00:02:49,110  -->  00:02:56,580
every file and then a salary's that sees the file and you also have a read me 2013 text file and this

43

00:02:56,580  -->  00:03:03,150
text file has a reference if you need to understand what all the acronyms stand for.

44

00:03:03,150  -->  00:03:06,270
You'll go ahead and use are to open up the batting.

45

00:03:06,270  -->  00:03:07,590
Let's see every file.

46

00:03:07,770  -->  00:03:09,870
Then you'll check out the head of batting.

47

00:03:10,110  -->  00:03:11,900
And again notice that some of these columns.

48

00:03:11,910  -->  00:03:17,370
In fact a lot of these columns are just acronyms such as a B R or H and if you don't know what those

49

00:03:17,370  -->  00:03:23,700
acronyms mean you can go ahead and look at the read me 20:13 that text file which is located in the

50

00:03:23,700  -->  00:03:30,240
same folder as this Moneyball notebook and you scroll down you should see a list of acronyms and then

51

00:03:30,240  -->  00:03:31,470
there are definitions.

52

00:03:31,680  -->  00:03:36,590
But the new book will also help you out in understanding which acronyms you need to know.

53

00:03:37,150  -->  00:03:41,580
Then you'll go ahead and check the structure of the data frame you'll call head and there's outputs

54

00:03:41,580  -->  00:03:47,650
here to make sure that everything you're doing is following along correctly.

55

00:03:47,910  -->  00:03:52,490
After that we're going to perform some feature engineering which will learn about in a lot more detail

56

00:03:52,500  -->  00:03:56,840
and we actually cover machine learning but we'll create three more statistics.

57

00:03:56,880  -->  00:04:00,090
And the very first one batting average is actually done for you.

58

00:04:00,330  -->  00:04:04,380
But essentially you're going to click on these links which will take you to Wikipedia page.

59

00:04:04,410  -->  00:04:08,100
Go ahead and do batting average examples already done for you.

60

00:04:08,250  -->  00:04:12,460
You'll click on the batting average which will take you to the Wikipedia page for batting average and

61

00:04:12,520  -->  00:04:17,100
you going to scroll through the page until you can find the formula for batting average and in this

62

00:04:17,100  -->  00:04:23,470
case it's over eight here in this right hand corner HEG equals h divided by a B.

63

00:04:23,550  -->  00:04:26,890
And those acronyms are actually in your batting that see as we file.

64

00:04:26,900  -->  00:04:29,150
I mean you can come back here.

65

00:04:29,250  -->  00:04:36,990
Notice that it's HEG equals h divided by AB and you'll go ahead and call your columns the 8 column off

66

00:04:36,990  -->  00:04:44,220
with the batting data frame divided by the AB column for the batting data frame and set that to a column

67

00:04:44,220  -->  00:04:49,620
called B A which stands for batting average and that way you can create a batting average that's equal

68

00:04:49,620  -->  00:04:52,820
to hits divided by at base.

69

00:04:53,370  -->  00:04:57,510
And you can go ahead and check out the Wikipedia pages because you want more information as to why those

70

00:04:57,750  -->  00:05:00,270
particular statistics are important.

71

00:05:00,330  -->  00:05:04,640
Once you've done that you'll go ahead and create and feature engineer to more statistics.

72

00:05:04,910  -->  00:05:06,060
Fill out that code there.

73

00:05:06,100  -->  00:05:12,420
And the Neutrik structure of your data frame then you're going to merge the salary data with batting

74

00:05:12,420  -->  00:05:13,260
data.

75

00:05:13,260  -->  00:05:18,000
Now we actually haven't discussed too much about merging data frames together and the whole point that

76

00:05:18,000  -->  00:05:23,370
we didn't discuss that is that hopefully uing this project you can discover that on your own and if

77

00:05:23,370  -->  00:05:25,320
not if you're ever confused on anything.

78

00:05:25,320  -->  00:05:31,110
Always feel free to post the Q8 forums but what you can do is join your batting data frame that you

79

00:05:31,110  -->  00:05:37,770
just featured engineered with some salary data and there's a salary's that see as we file in the same

80

00:05:37,770  -->  00:05:38,820
folder.

81

00:05:39,000  -->  00:05:44,250
And eventually what you're going to do is merge these two data frames together and you summary make

82

00:05:44,250  -->  00:05:48,030
sure it matches up to what's shown here in the notebook and then you'll analyze.

83

00:05:48,030  -->  00:05:53,940
Finally the last players and as I previously mentioned the Oakland A's lost three key players which

84

00:05:53,950  -->  00:06:00,330
you could do is find those three key players do some more analysis on them and figure out their particular

85

00:06:00,330  -->  00:06:07,580
statistics such as on base percentage slugging and bet batting average and at bats then what you're

86

00:06:07,590  -->  00:06:12,150
going to do and this is the key to the project is find replacement players.

87

00:06:12,300  -->  00:06:13,650
You have all the information I need.

88

00:06:13,650  -->  00:06:19,380
And your final task is to find replacement players for the key three players shown here that you lost

89

00:06:19,800  -->  00:06:21,670
and you have three constraints.

90

00:06:21,750  -->  00:06:26,200
They should have a total combined salary of no more than 15 million dollars.

91

00:06:26,250  -->  00:06:30,660
The combined number of at bats needs to be equal to or greater than the loss players which is shown

92

00:06:30,660  -->  00:06:31,370
here.

93

00:06:31,560  -->  00:06:37,260
And then there I mean oh BP which is on base percentage which show later or previously calculate has

94

00:06:37,260  -->  00:06:42,310
to be greater than or equal to the mean of the BP to the last players.

95

00:06:42,720  -->  00:06:46,650
And then there's some more instructions on how you should do this as well as some helpful phone sorting

96

00:06:46,650  -->  00:06:48,300
data frames.

97

00:06:48,300  -->  00:06:49,130
All right.

98

00:06:49,230  -->  00:06:52,200
The ending is left intentionally more open ended.

99

00:06:52,200  -->  00:06:57,930
There's lots and lots of different answers as far as finding three players that can successfully replace

100

00:06:58,320  -->  00:07:01,880
these lost boys or lost players something to know.

101

00:07:01,920  -->  00:07:06,630
And it's explained in the notebook what we're doing here is a little unrealistic because we're basically

102

00:07:06,630  -->  00:07:12,720
treating any player that's not already on the Oakland A's as a free agent that we can sign on.

103

00:07:12,810  -->  00:07:17,460
That's not exactly true in real life but we'll go ahead and continue as if that is the case.

104

00:07:17,550  -->  00:07:21,740
Again if you have any questions throughout this project feel free to post the Q&A forums.

105

00:07:21,750  -->  00:07:26,040
Make sure you go ahead and read the descriptions of everything that's provided in the notebook because

106

00:07:26,040  -->  00:07:30,030
most of the steps are laid out pretty clearly here in the notebook free to follow.

107

00:07:30,030  -->  00:07:30,540
All right.

108

00:07:30,660  -->  00:07:32,760
I hope you have a lot of fun with this project.

109

00:07:32,760  -->  00:07:37,380
Keep in mind that this was a real problem in real life than if you had a time machine you could go back

110

00:07:37,380  -->  00:07:43,800
to the year 2001 with your laptop and our studio and make some real money solving these real problems

111

00:07:43,820  -->  00:07:44,690
.

112

00:07:45,540  -->  00:07:46,200
OK.

113

00:07:46,230  -->  00:07:51,180
Again I hope you have a lot of fun in the next lecture will be a full solutions walkthrough of this

114

00:07:51,580  -->  00:07:52,600
project.

115

00:07:52,620  -->  00:07:54,510
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture
