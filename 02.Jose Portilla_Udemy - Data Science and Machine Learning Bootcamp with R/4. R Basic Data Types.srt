00:00:01,050  -->  00:00:05,430
Hello everyone and welcome to the art data types lecture and this lecture.

2

00:00:05,430  -->  00:00:10,260
We're just going to discuss some basic data types and our let's go ahead and get started by going to

3

00:00:10,260  -->  00:00:11,390
our studio.

4

00:00:11,790  -->  00:00:18,660
OK so here we are in our studio and let's go ahead and discuss some of the basic data types.

5

00:00:18,720  -->  00:00:26,010
The first data type is the numeric data type and the numeric data type consists of decimal otherwise

6

00:00:26,010  -->  00:00:28,530
known as floating point values.

7

00:00:28,530  -->  00:00:35,970
So for example 2.2 is a numeric and I can assign something like a

8

00:00:38,710  -->  00:00:40,640
2.2.

9

00:00:40,800  -->  00:00:46,320
So this floating point numbers are part of the numeric class in R and integers which are natural or

10

00:00:46,320  -->  00:00:52,960
whole numbers such as 5 or 7 are also part of the numeric class.

11

00:00:52,980  -->  00:00:59,270
So you have this overall numeric class and then you have decimals or floating point values and integers

12

00:00:59,280  -->  00:01:01,990
so those both fall under numeric class.

13

00:01:02,070  -->  00:01:10,770
The next one we have is the logical and the logical class consists of boolean values which is true or

14

00:01:10,770  -->  00:01:11,830
false.

15

00:01:11,880  -->  00:01:17,840
So an R These are written in all caps.

16

00:01:18,030  -->  00:01:25,950
So true or false or which you can also do is just in capital letters right t or death.

17

00:01:25,980  -->  00:01:30,170
So for example I can't assign a CBT.

18

00:01:30,810  -->  00:01:34,950
And you'll notice here it says a true.

19

00:01:34,950  -->  00:01:36,470
So that's a capital T.

20

00:01:36,520  -->  00:01:42,120
If I do a lowercase ill get confused and think that you're referring to lowercase t is some sort of

21

00:01:42,120  -->  00:01:42,630
function.

22

00:01:42,660  -->  00:01:43,910
So just keep that in mind.

23

00:01:44,160  -->  00:01:54,600
It should always be either just a capital true or a capital C and likewise a capital F or capital false

24

00:01:54,930  -->  00:01:56,890
so false in all caps.

25

00:01:57,060  -->  00:01:59,490
And those are known as logicals.

26

00:01:59,520  -->  00:02:04,680
OK so we've discussed numerics which are thus more floating point values or whole numbers.

27

00:02:04,680  -->  00:02:07,370
Now we have logicals which are true or false.

28

00:02:07,740  -->  00:02:11,160
And then we also have characters which are also known as strings.

29

00:02:11,280  -->  00:02:15,010
So texture string values are known as characters and are.

30

00:02:15,210  -->  00:02:19,590
And you can use quotation marks either double or single quotes to make a character string.

31

00:02:19,670  -->  00:02:21,660
Let me go in and show you how we can do that.

32

00:02:22,230  -->  00:02:29,010
So if I have something like hello and we've actually seen this sort of character string before we were

33

00:02:29,010  -->  00:02:30,310
printing them out.

34

00:02:30,510  -->  00:02:32,300
Hello world.

35

00:02:32,480  -->  00:02:33,320
There's my strain.

36

00:02:33,350  -->  00:02:36,480
I notice in the output you'll see double quotes here.

37

00:02:36,510  -->  00:02:40,500
That doesn't mean anything it just means that this is a string.

38

00:02:40,500  -->  00:02:44,660
Ok so you can use either single quotes or double quotes for strings.

39

00:02:44,670  -->  00:02:47,940
Let me go ahead and show simple example.

40

00:02:48,000  -->  00:02:55,740
We'll say is hello and then we'll also in double quotes we can say hello.

41

00:02:55,950  -->  00:03:01,050
I encourage you to use double quotes because that's more common by convention but you can feel fine

42

00:03:01,050  -->  00:03:03,210
using single quotes Assos work as well.

43

00:03:03,570  -->  00:03:07,070
But again I would encourage the use of double quotes.

44

00:03:07,090  -->  00:03:14,100
OK so let's say you have some sort of variable here we have variables A and B and you want to know what

45

00:03:14,100  -->  00:03:19,260
data type they or you can use the class function to check the data type variable.

46

00:03:19,470  -->  00:03:24,000
Later on we're going to learn a lot more about functions that had a constructor own functions buffering

47

00:03:24,020  -->  00:03:24,110
.

48

00:03:24,150  -->  00:03:28,920
Now you can think of a function as just having a name.

49

00:03:28,920  -->  00:03:32,800
And here you can start seeing our studios built in help.

50

00:03:32,880  -->  00:03:39,630
So our position is the simple generic function mechanism and it's going to be used to basically return

51

00:03:40,140  -->  00:03:44,400
whatever data type class A variable is.

52

00:03:44,400  -->  00:03:47,450
So for example we have a and we know it's hello.

53

00:03:47,670  -->  00:03:54,810
So if I pass a into this class function so the function is the name and then to print CS and you add

54

00:03:54,810  -->  00:03:59,640
an arguments inside of the predecease it's going to return what class it is.

55

00:03:59,640  -->  00:04:08,430
So this is a character class and it's going to be the same for B also at character class so those text

56

00:04:08,550  -->  00:04:14,970
string values are known as character classes and we can go ahead and check the classes of other things

57

00:04:14,970  -->  00:04:22,440
so let's say 12 that's a numeric and we can check the class of 3 2.2.

58

00:04:22,440  -->  00:04:23,760
That's also numeric.

59

00:04:23,760  -->  00:04:29,430
So even though a 12 is an integer and 3 2.2 is a floating point or decimal number those both fall under

60

00:04:29,430  -->  00:04:31,720
the numeric data type class.

61

00:04:31,950  -->  00:04:38,040
And then finally we can go ahead and affirm that true is a logical and these are also sometimes known

62

00:04:38,040  -->  00:04:44,100
as boolean values and we can do the same for f which stands for false.

63

00:04:44,100  -->  00:04:47,260
MEMBER It's capital F and that's also logical.

64

00:04:47,510  -->  00:04:53,430
OK so those are just some of the basic data types and are later on we're going to use these basic data

65

00:04:53,430  -->  00:05:00,460
types to build on top of them as building blocks as we learn more about data structures in our.

66

00:05:00,750  -->  00:05:04,910
And one of the most common ones we're going to learn about next is called the vector.

67

00:05:05,190  -->  00:05:05,580
OK.

68

00:05:05,670  -->  00:05:07,350
So you should have gone out of this lecture.

69

00:05:07,380  -->  00:05:14,670
It's just how to check data type classes using the class function here and the three main data types

70

00:05:14,670  -->  00:05:15,840
that we're concerned with right now.

71

00:05:15,870  -->  00:05:20,100
The basic ones which are numerics which consists of decimals and integers.

72

00:05:20,310  -->  00:05:25,000
Logicals which are those boolean true and false values and then characters which are those text and

73

00:05:25,050  -->  00:05:26,280
string values.

74

00:05:26,550  -->  00:05:28,620
Ok that's it for this lecture.

75

00:05:28,620  -->  00:05:30,890
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next one.
