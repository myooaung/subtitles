00:00:00,240  -->  00:00:04,380
Hello everyone and welcome to the lecture on C S V input output.

2

00:00:04,380  -->  00:00:09,990
This lecture will discuss how to read a C as we fall into our how to write a sci fi file as output with

3

00:00:09,990  -->  00:00:13,570
our let's go and jump to our studio to get started.

4

00:00:13,620  -->  00:00:14,020
OK.

5

00:00:14,040  -->  00:00:20,370
So here we are our studio C S V stands for comma separated variable and it's one of the most common

6

00:00:20,370  -->  00:00:23,370
ways we'll be working with data throughout this course.

7

00:00:23,430  -->  00:00:29,220
The basic format of the CSP file is the first line indicating the column names and the rest of the rows

8

00:00:29,220  -->  00:00:33,050
or lines being data points separated by commas.

9

00:00:33,120  -->  00:00:38,430
One of the most basic ways to read a c a c file in arm is just to use the read that C as V is actually

10

00:00:38,430  -->  00:00:39,870
built into our.

11

00:00:40,170  -->  00:00:47,580
So go ahead and create a sample c file if you need one or you can actually create one quickly by saying

12

00:00:47,610  -->  00:00:48,060
right.

13

00:00:48,080  -->  00:00:51,780
But C-s the empty cars

14

00:00:54,150  -->  00:01:04,350
file my let's say underscore exampled CACP and don't worry about these warning messages will go ahead

15

00:01:04,350  -->  00:01:06,590
to just clear the cons..

16

00:01:06,600  -->  00:01:11,870
So again if you need to get a sample CXXVI you can either open up Notepad.

17

00:01:11,880  -->  00:01:17,370
So for example if you have Notepad you can go out and search for it for using Windows.

18

00:01:17,580  -->  00:01:23,040
Otherwise you can just use any other sort of basic note or text editor and you can just go out and quickly

19

00:01:23,040  -->  00:01:25,530
make a CC file using your notepad.

20

00:01:25,530  -->  00:01:29,300
So for example I could just copy and paste some information here.

21

00:01:29,310  -->  00:01:36,780
Name comma orders comma date as the header and then John comma 12 orders comma some dates and then just

22

00:01:36,780  -->  00:01:38,330
go in and save file.

23

00:01:38,460  -->  00:01:46,220
Say there's all files in other underscore example that CXXVI.

24

00:01:46,470  -->  00:01:47,920
So you have several options here.

25

00:01:47,930  -->  00:01:49,380
If you're using Windows you can good.

26

00:01:49,410  -->  00:01:50,650
Open up Notepad.

27

00:01:50,700  -->  00:01:51,870
Write something like this.

28

00:01:51,870  -->  00:01:53,790
Your own CSFB file if you want.

29

00:01:53,790  -->  00:01:56,190
Maybe you already have a CACP file you want to work with.

30

00:01:56,370  -->  00:02:02,130
Or if you don't have no Petters and don't want to write your own CXXVI file you can just basically write

31

00:02:02,130  -->  00:02:06,570
this one line of code here and it will make an example cxxviii file for you.

32

00:02:06,570  -->  00:02:12,690
You'll say right doc cxxviii has an empty cars which is that cars data frankly work with a little bit

33

00:02:12,690  -->  00:02:17,610
in the past and say file equals and then whatever your C every file name is.

34

00:02:18,060  -->  00:02:20,700
OK let's go in and clear the council

35

00:02:23,430  -->  00:02:26,510
and begin talking about reading in a CSC file.

36

00:02:26,520  -->  00:02:29,380
We actually just showed a quick example of how to write the CAC file.

37

00:02:29,440  -->  00:02:31,830
We'll go over it more formally later on.

38

00:02:32,160  -->  00:02:35,590
As far as reading a c c as we file it will look something like this.

39

00:02:35,670  -->  00:02:42,630
You'll have a variable name and you're going to say read dot C S V and then you're going to pass in

40

00:02:42,630  -->  00:02:49,380
the whole file path to the C S V file or at the CSP file is already in your working directory.

41

00:02:49,380  -->  00:02:53,860
You can check if it's in your working directory by looking over here in this tab in the files.

42

00:02:53,910  -->  00:02:57,340
So have all my C as the files in my working directory.

43

00:02:57,360  -->  00:02:59,910
You can just pass on the C as the file itself.

44

00:02:59,910  -->  00:03:05,700
And what's nice about our studio is if I begin typing let's say E X I can click tab and it will auto

45

00:03:05,700  -->  00:03:08,960
complete the CC file for me.

46

00:03:09,750  -->  00:03:14,010
Sometimes you may get a warning message and if you get a warning message it's important to go ahead

47

00:03:14,010  -->  00:03:17,950
and check to make sure you actually imported the data correctly.

48

00:03:17,960  -->  00:03:20,230
Here it looks like everything worked out well.

49

00:03:20,250  -->  00:03:25,260
This particular warning just showed up because I had an extra space on my final four Fly-In but there

50

00:03:25,260  -->  00:03:28,100
was actually no data there so it doesn't really matter.

51

00:03:28,110  -->  00:03:31,030
Again this is just a warning message not an error.

52

00:03:31,290  -->  00:03:36,630
If you get a warning message just go ahead and check up the tail and head of whatever the file you just

53

00:03:36,660  -->  00:03:37,540
imported was.

54

00:03:37,560  -->  00:03:42,870
Make sure nothing looks out of order or strange but essentially what we have here now we just go ahead

55

00:03:42,870  -->  00:03:43,170
and check.

56

00:03:43,170  -->  00:03:49,320
Class of x is a day different and everything you learn about data frame all the operations you can work

57

00:03:49,320  -->  00:03:50,540
with on a data frame.

58

00:03:50,610  -->  00:03:54,510
You can now work with your CSP files and do the same thing.

59

00:03:55,230  -->  00:03:58,350
OK let's talk about writing to a C SFE file.

60

00:03:58,380  -->  00:03:58,830
I'm going to go ahead.

61

00:03:58,830  -->  00:04:06,420
Just click control if you want to write to a sci fi file you can just say right dot V passes the name

62

00:04:06,420  -->  00:04:08,020
of the data frame you want to write.

63

00:04:08,020  -->  00:04:13,860
Let's say you want to write the ex-aide of frame we just import it and then you say file equals and

64

00:04:13,860  -->  00:04:17,060
then you just pass in whatever you want the file to be called.

65

00:04:17,310  -->  00:04:27,830
So I will say my underscore new example DOS CXXVI enter and notice if I look over here.

66

00:04:27,840  -->  00:04:32,180
I see my new example of C as V and the date it was saved.

67

00:04:32,490  -->  00:04:32,810
OK.

68

00:04:32,820  -->  00:04:34,070
That's really all there is to it.

69

00:04:34,070  -->  00:04:36,750
As far as reading and writing that CSB files.

70

00:04:37,020  -->  00:04:44,360
So again it's just read dot C S V and then you pass in the complete file path to your file.

71

00:04:44,520  -->  00:04:46,990
Or you just pass in the CAC file.

72

00:04:46,990  -->  00:04:50,430
If it's already in the same directory so it's just.

73

00:04:50,430  -->  00:04:54,000
Example CSP.

74

00:04:54,720  -->  00:04:55,860
You may get a warning message.

75

00:04:55,870  -->  00:04:57,640
Just keep that in mind.

76

00:04:58,250  -->  00:04:59,970
I'm going to go out and try importing another one.

77

00:04:59,970  -->  00:05:05,100
Let's go ahead to say my underscore example CXVII.

78

00:05:05,610  -->  00:05:07,160
Here's another example see as V.

79

00:05:07,170  -->  00:05:10,880
This case is the empty cars data frame that we just saved.

80

00:05:11,670  -->  00:05:15,150
OK so that's it really for the basics of reading and writing as the files.

81

00:05:15,150  -->  00:05:16,620
It's really as simple as that.

82

00:05:16,620  -->  00:05:22,830
Just read that C S V in assign that to a new data free variable or write that C S V and save it as a

83

00:05:22,830  -->  00:05:25,230
file if you need more help on these topics.

84

00:05:25,230  -->  00:05:27,560
You can just say help.

85

00:05:28,290  -->  00:05:37,080
Read C as V enter and you'll have an entire documentation page on data input and you'll be able to notice

86

00:05:37,080  -->  00:05:39,980
they can't specify things like skipping a header.

87

00:05:40,110  -->  00:05:47,670
What your separator is in this case it's denoted by cxxviii solo just say separator equals comma but

88

00:05:47,670  -->  00:05:55,810
you can actually say add an argument Sep equals tab or the pipe operator whatever you happen to be separating

89

00:05:55,820  -->  00:05:55,860
.

90

00:05:55,890  -->  00:06:00,940
Each column in your see is free file or whatever type of text file you actually have.

91

00:06:00,980  -->  00:06:03,040
Again you can always use chukka help.

92

00:06:03,060  -->  00:06:05,550
Read the C S V for more information on this.

93

00:06:05,880  -->  00:06:06,630
OK.

94

00:06:06,630  -->  00:06:08,740
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
