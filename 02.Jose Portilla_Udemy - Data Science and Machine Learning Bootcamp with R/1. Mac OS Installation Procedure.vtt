00:00:00.930  -->  00:00:06.420
Hello everyone and welcome to the Mac OS installation and setup lecture in this lecture I'm going to

2

00:00:06.420  -->  00:00:11.610
show you how to install two things our studio and the our programming language.

3

00:00:11.610  -->  00:00:16.140
Let's go ahead and jump to our browser in order to figure out how to actually download and set those

4

00:00:16.140  -->  00:00:16.670
up.

5

00:00:16.950  -->  00:00:19.270
I'm going to go ahead and jump to the browser now.

6

00:00:19.270  -->  00:00:21.690
All right here and then my browser to get started.

7

00:00:21.730  -->  00:00:24.360
Oh you're going to search for is the term our studio.

8

00:00:24.390  -->  00:00:25.530
That's all one word.

9

00:00:25.740  -->  00:00:29.310
It's R S T U D I O.

10

00:00:29.880  -->  00:00:34.950
And then you're going to go ahead and either click directly to download our studio or go to our studio

11

00:00:34.950  -->  00:00:35.550
the com

12

00:00:38.730  -->  00:00:40.650
once your our studio com.

13

00:00:40.820  -->  00:00:45.510
You'll go ahead and click products our studio.

14

00:00:46.830  -->  00:00:52.670
Scroll down until you see open source edition that's all we're going to be using.

15

00:00:52.680  -->  00:00:59.190
We're going to download our studio desktop and that will take us to this download page.

16

00:00:59.190  -->  00:01:04.980
Now if you clicked our studio download you would have gone directly to this page which you'll notice

17

00:01:05.040  -->  00:01:10.230
is that you'll see right here our studio requires our 2.1 1 or higher.

18

00:01:10.230  -->  00:01:13.940
If you don't already have or you can download it and then it has a little link here.

19

00:01:14.160  -->  00:01:19.800
Something to know is our studio is the development environment we're going to be using the actual programming

20

00:01:19.800  -->  00:01:21.130
language of our.

21

00:01:21.390  -->  00:01:26.610
And what's actually going to be doing all the processing is going to be downloaded separately.

22

00:01:26.610  -->  00:01:33.660
Go ahead and click the link on that our studio download page and it will take you to cram our studio

23

00:01:33.660  -->  00:01:35.170
dot com.

24

00:01:35.250  -->  00:01:39.780
And here's where you can actually install the our programming language and you'll see that there is

25

00:01:39.780  -->  00:01:42.270
a download for our Mac OSX.

26

00:01:42.270  -->  00:01:44.100
Go ahead and click on that.

27

00:01:44.550  -->  00:01:46.150
It'll take you to this page.

28

00:01:46.180  -->  00:01:51.540
We'll go ahead and do is scroll down here and you'll look for the latest version of our in this case

29

00:01:51.540  -->  00:01:51.630
.

30

00:01:51.630  -->  00:01:57.510
It's our 3.3 point one if you want different versions you can keep coming down if you have older versions

31

00:01:57.510  -->  00:01:58.770
of Mac OS.

32

00:01:58.770  -->  00:02:04.440
But go ahead and just get the latest stuff package version go ahead and save it to your computer wherever

33

00:02:04.440  -->  00:02:04.980
you want.

34

00:02:04.980  -->  00:02:09.600
I'll save it to the desktop and let it download.

35

00:02:09.600  -->  00:02:13.750
Then once we've let it download we'll go ahead install it.

36

00:02:14.130  -->  00:02:18.060
I'm going to fast forward to this finish and download.

37

00:02:18.090  -->  00:02:18.420
All right.

38

00:02:18.430  -->  00:02:24.150
The R dash 3.3 point one package a jump forward in time it's finished installing or downloading excuse

39

00:02:24.150  -->  00:02:30.250
me and I want to go ahead and get that actual PKC file that will be in your downloads by default.

40

00:02:30.360  -->  00:02:34.440
And in my case I actually put it to my desktop going to go to minimize this window.

41

00:02:34.440  -->  00:02:40.560
And here you see that my desktop which will go ahead and do is double click on this package and then

42

00:02:40.560  -->  00:02:45.820
you'll just follow the instructions for the actual download of our installation of our.

43

00:02:45.960  -->  00:02:53.760
You'll go ahead and click Continue click all the defaults continue except the license you'll accept

44

00:02:53.760  -->  00:02:55.630
the destination agree everything.

45

00:02:55.680  -->  00:02:57.530
I already have our install.

46

00:02:57.630  -->  00:03:00.270
I'll go ahead and disagree to this and close out of that window.

47

00:03:00.270  -->  00:03:05.310
But again you just double click on this package and just go ahead and click continue through this graphical

48

00:03:05.310  -->  00:03:08.250
installer and everything should be OK for you.

49

00:03:08.250  -->  00:03:12.930
You can always post any questions to the Q&A forum if you have trouble with this step but it should

50

00:03:12.930  -->  00:03:14.410
be pretty basic.

51

00:03:15.030  -->  00:03:18.090
That's the step for installing the our programming language.

52

00:03:18.090  -->  00:03:21.050
What's next for us is installing our studio.

53

00:03:21.060  -->  00:03:24.460
Let's go ahead and jump back to our browser.

54

00:03:25.230  -->  00:03:26.950
Ok I'm back to my browser now.

55

00:03:27.270  -->  00:03:28.870
And I don't need this page anymore.

56

00:03:28.890  -->  00:03:31.980
The actual installation and download of our page.

57

00:03:31.980  -->  00:03:36.570
Now we're going to go ahead and continue on the installation and download of our studio.

58

00:03:36.720  -->  00:03:42.410
What you'll do is go to this our studio page and you'll notice if you go ahead and zoom in here there

59

00:03:42.580  -->  00:03:48.600
is a specific installer for Mac OS which would go ahead and do is click on that link and then download

60

00:03:48.600  -->  00:03:50.090
the DMG.

61

00:03:50.340  -->  00:03:56.730
I'm going to go ahead and again put it in my desktop save it and this will download everything you need

62

00:03:56.730  -->  00:03:59.370
for the installation of our studio.

63

00:03:59.400  -->  00:04:03.090
Again you've already installed and downloaded the our programming language.

64

00:04:03.120  -->  00:04:07.340
Now we're going to download and install our studio which is going to be the development environment

65

00:04:07.350  -->  00:04:08.730
we're going to be working with.

66

00:04:08.880  -->  00:04:13.170
Once we're done of this installation phase and lecture where we're going to do is go ahead and hop over

67

00:04:13.410  -->  00:04:18.180
to the actual environment Overview section of the course and then we'll give you a whole tour of our

68

00:04:18.180  -->  00:04:19.090
studio.

69

00:04:19.110  -->  00:04:21.910
Right now we're just focusing on installing everything.

70

00:04:22.080  -->  00:04:27.060
I'm going to go ahead and fast forward for this install or download to finish.

71

00:04:27.060  -->  00:04:27.510
All right.

72

00:04:27.510  -->  00:04:28.900
No that's finished downloading.

73

00:04:28.920  -->  00:04:32.120
I'm going to go ahead and find my desktop since that's where I saved it.

74

00:04:32.370  -->  00:04:38.220
If you choose the default location will your downloads instances the DMZ file we have to do is double

75

00:04:38.220  -->  00:04:39.410
click on it.

76

00:04:40.020  -->  00:04:45.780
It will open the studio thought the MGE and then you'll have this little window pop up.

77

00:04:45.810  -->  00:04:51.640
All you have to do now is drag our studio over to applications and let it go.

78

00:04:51.930  -->  00:04:55.020
And that will basically finish the installation.

79

00:04:55.020  -->  00:05:00.990
And then what you can do is search for our studio and you should see this pop up.

80

00:05:00.990  -->  00:05:07.620
Go ahead and click enter for it and our studio will start for you already have a bunch of stuff in here

81

00:05:07.660  -->  00:05:09.340
but this will look a lot different.

82

00:05:09.340  -->  00:05:14.670
He'll be pretty nice and clean and we'll go over how to actually set up your environment the way you

83

00:05:14.670  -->  00:05:19.140
want it but that's it for the installation of our in our studio.

84

00:05:19.140  -->  00:05:24.420
Again feel free to post any questions to the Q8 forums if any of this was troublesome for you.

85

00:05:24.420  -->  00:05:26.640
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
