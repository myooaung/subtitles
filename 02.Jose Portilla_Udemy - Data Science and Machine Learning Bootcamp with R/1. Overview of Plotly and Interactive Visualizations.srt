00:00:01,410  -->  00:00:06,870
Hello everyone and welcome to the interactive visualizations of plotless section of this course in this

2

00:00:06,870  -->  00:00:12,060
lecture we're going to explain what Platini is and how you can convert your G-G plot to knowledge to

3

00:00:12,060  -->  00:00:18,660
plot Lee and make interactive visualizations without learning any more new material in order to get

4

00:00:18,660  -->  00:00:19,620
started.

5

00:00:19,620  -->  00:00:24,450
Let's start by explaining what plot he is as a company and what the plot the open source library is

6

00:00:24,780  -->  00:00:25,590
in order to do this.

7

00:00:25,590  -->  00:00:31,190
Go ahead and go to this link or just in your your browser type in P L O T L Y.

8

00:00:31,290  -->  00:00:34,710
Or even just google search plotline and it will take you to this web page.

9

00:00:34,740  -->  00:00:36,800
I'm going to go ahead and jump to that page now.

10

00:00:37,080  -->  00:00:37,440
All right.

11

00:00:37,440  -->  00:00:45,720
Here I am at Piel o ot l y plotless the official Web site plotless is a company that maintains and manages

12

00:00:45,720  -->  00:00:51,960
the plotless open source library for interactive visualizations and Laplante allows you to do is create

13

00:00:51,990  -->  00:00:58,460
interactive visualizations in a variety of languages such as Matlab Excel javascript Python and are

14

00:00:58,460  -->  00:00:58,790
.

15

00:00:58,790  -->  00:01:03,450
If you go ahead and click on the link here it will take you to Plata.

16

00:01:03,660  -->  00:01:11,070
Slash are slash getting started partly for R is entirely open source free and self-hosted plumply.

17

00:01:11,070  -->  00:01:16,830
The company makes money with a pro edition where you can go ahead and get support and also have an online

18

00:01:16,860  -->  00:01:17,540
editor.

19

00:01:17,550  -->  00:01:18,660
We won't be using any of that.

20

00:01:18,660  -->  00:01:22,390
We'll just use the free mission which is more than enough for us.

21

00:01:22,590  -->  00:01:27,510
And if you're interested on actually seeing the code since it's open source you can click here and it

22

00:01:27,510  -->  00:01:33,500
will take you to this hobe link where they have all the source and web interactive interface for plot

23

00:01:33,510  -->  00:01:35,210
the code.

24

00:01:35,280  -->  00:01:41,890
Let's go ahead and jump back to the getting started page slightly for our has two options.

25

00:01:41,880  -->  00:01:48,810
There's a basic plotline package which will then download and install the plotline library and you can

26

00:01:48,810  -->  00:01:53,910
call plot underscore l y in order to create these interactive visualizations.

27

00:01:53,910  -->  00:01:58,290
However what's really nice about plotline and they've done a lot of work on this recently is if you

28

00:01:58,290  -->  00:02:03,350
go ahead and click here on G-G plot to there's a plot.

29

00:02:03,380  -->  00:02:08,430
L y as you plot to slash getting started page and this library is really awesome.

30

00:02:08,430  -->  00:02:16,560
Basically plot Lee has a function called G-G plotline which will convert G.G. plot to figures into graphs

31

00:02:16,560  -->  00:02:21,960
drawn directly of plot lead thought JS Which is the interactive javascript library plotless is based

32

00:02:21,960  -->  00:02:27,630
off of you can also just install it if installed up packages politely and it will allow you to quickly

33

00:02:27,630  -->  00:02:33,060
and easily make visualisations interactive using just your Ju-Ju plot to knowledge that you've already

34

00:02:33,060  -->  00:02:33,960
learned.

35

00:02:34,020  -->  00:02:37,910
Let me go ahead and show you how this all works by jumping to our studio.

36

00:02:37,950  -->  00:02:40,530
I'm going to go ahead and jump there now.

37

00:02:40,530  -->  00:02:46,470
All right here we are at our studio where we're going to go ahead and do is install the plot Lee package

38

00:02:46,470  -->  00:02:46,920
.

39

00:02:46,920  -->  00:02:56,100
Go head and go to your counsel and say install packages and in quotes pasan P L O T L Y and then select

40

00:02:56,190  -->  00:02:58,160
enter and Eltis this will do.

41

00:02:58,170  -->  00:03:03,600
It's going to install all the packages and libraries you need in order to run interactive visualisations

42

00:03:03,840  -->  00:03:06,240
in our studio.

43

00:03:06,240  -->  00:03:07,760
Looks like we're all good and installed.

44

00:03:07,770  -->  00:03:12,460
I'm going to go out and clear the console and show you an example of how this all works.

45

00:03:12,660  -->  00:03:16,410
Well we're going to do it in our script call Library.

46

00:03:16,830  -->  00:03:23,360
We'll call G-G plot too and then we'll also call plot blee.

47

00:03:24,840  -->  00:03:30,030
Now we're going to do is create a plot in G-G plot 2 and convert it to an interactive visualization

48

00:03:30,030  -->  00:03:32,820
with the plot Li or Gigia plot Lee library.

49

00:03:32,880  -->  00:03:34,470
Let me go ahead and just show you how this would look.

50

00:03:34,470  -->  00:03:36,370
Normally it's just G.G. plot.

51

00:03:36,780  -->  00:03:43,560
I'm going to say P.L. G.G. plot and let's go ahead and just plot the empty cars dataset that we're really

52

00:03:43,560  -->  00:03:50,130
familiar with and say Ã¦sthetics will go in and do mpg versus wait and just make a scatterplot off of

53

00:03:50,130  -->  00:03:56,640
this GM underscore points and then since this is the script I'm going to go ahead and say Prince P.L.

54

00:03:57,150  -->  00:03:58,770
Let's go ahead and run the source

55

00:04:02,150  -->  00:04:04,430
and notice we get the scatterplot out.

56

00:04:04,470  -->  00:04:05,190
I click on this.

57

00:04:05,190  -->  00:04:06,300
Nothing's going to happen.

58

00:04:06,300  -->  00:04:11,100
I can click zoom to get a better view of this or zoom than view but that's it and that's what we're

59

00:04:11,100  -->  00:04:14,590
familiar with G-G plot and G.G. plot 2.

60

00:04:14,640  -->  00:04:18,690
We can go ahead and add more arguments to this change the sizes and shapes etc..

61

00:04:18,960  -->  00:04:24,070
Now we're going to see how we can make this interactive three very simple command of Jiji plot.

62

00:04:24,080  -->  00:04:31,080
Lee will you go ahead and do is say Well go ahead to say GPL.

63

00:04:31,770  -->  00:04:36,890
You call the Gee-Gee plot Leite function and then you just pasand the figure.

64

00:04:36,960  -->  00:04:40,380
In this case I'm just Pesi in this P.L. plot.

65

00:04:40,380  -->  00:04:46,350
Basically what's happened is I'm converting this normal G.G. plot into a plot plot just by calling it

66

00:04:46,470  -->  00:04:51,990
into the function G.G. plot Lee and passing it to the very old bold GPL and now what I'm going to do

67

00:04:51,990  -->  00:04:55,500
is instead of printing P.L. and will print GPL.

68

00:04:55,800  -->  00:04:57,540
Let's go ahead and run this source

69

00:05:00,540  -->  00:05:02,330
and sometimes it takes a little while to load.

70

00:05:02,360  -->  00:05:03,940
It looks like you're ready to go.

71

00:05:03,990  -->  00:05:05,090
Now notice what happens.

72

00:05:05,090  -->  00:05:11,880
My cursor is an interactive cross-hair cursor and now I can actually zoom in highlight over points and

73

00:05:11,880  -->  00:05:17,090
get information off those points and I can double click to zoom back out.

74

00:05:17,250  -->  00:05:24,570
I can use all these tools appear such as Pan or pan around I can use box select in order to select these

75

00:05:24,570  -->  00:05:25,990
points and highlight them.

76

00:05:26,100  -->  00:05:29,750
I can use Lassus selects double click to do that.

77

00:05:29,840  -->  00:05:35,820
These last a select select points manually in that fashion double click to do that and Ill tell you

78

00:05:35,820  -->  00:05:37,540
it has been produced by plotless.

79

00:05:37,980  -->  00:05:44,700
And hopefully now you can see this is a super useful tool to create interactive visualizations with

80

00:05:45,330  -->  00:05:50,820
learning anything new you can take all your G-G plot 2 knowledge and convert it to a plotline library

81

00:05:51,120  -->  00:05:54,860
or plot leave visualization just by calling the G.G. plot command.

82

00:05:54,890  -->  00:05:56,190
And that's pretty awesome.

83

00:05:56,190  -->  00:06:00,260
Let me go ahead and jump back to the documentation page or Ju-Ju plot.

84

00:06:00,260  -->  00:06:04,650
Lee going to go to the web browser now.

85

00:06:04,680  -->  00:06:09,600
All right here I am in my web browser and now I'm at the documentation page for the Gee-Gee plot.

86

00:06:09,600  -->  00:06:12,670
Lee and partly Judy plot to library.

87

00:06:12,900  -->  00:06:16,380
This your L is P L O T L Y.

88

00:06:16,380  -->  00:06:19,540
Slash G-G plot to slash.

89

00:06:19,830  -->  00:06:24,050
And in the next lecture I'll provide all the links for all this information.

90

00:06:24,060  -->  00:06:30,720
Basically if you go to this web page it will show you a few examples of how to use G-G plot really which

91

00:06:30,790  -->  00:06:31,750
you plot to.

92

00:06:31,950  -->  00:06:37,170
But more importantly if you keep scrolling down there's the documentation examples and basically the

93

00:06:37,170  -->  00:06:41,930
entire documentation for G.G. plot 2 has been converted to plot Lee.

94

00:06:42,030  -->  00:06:48,750
In these examples that means if you ever want to know how to create a density plot a scatterplot a histogram

95

00:06:48,750  -->  00:06:54,490
if you go down here to see mystical charts using geometers square histogram stat underscore smooth geometer

96

00:06:54,490  -->  00:07:00,720
square box plots all the G.G. plot two functions that layers that we're familiar with have now been

97

00:07:00,900  -->  00:07:01,920
done in plot lead.

98

00:07:02,100  -->  00:07:06,920
And you can easily look up this documentation in case you ever need any examples of how to do it.

99

00:07:07,230  -->  00:07:09,230
And that's basically all I want to show you.

100

00:07:09,360  -->  00:07:15,420
You already have all the knowledge you need for G-G plot to now through G.G. plotless simple function

101

00:07:15,420  -->  00:07:15,690
.

102

00:07:15,690  -->  00:07:20,940
You can cover all that knowledge to an interactive visualization extremely easily and you can impress

103

00:07:20,940  -->  00:07:24,380
your friends and colleagues with all the charts you can now make.

104

00:07:24,390  -->  00:07:31,740
For example if you want to do it histogram and G.G. plot ly you can go click on the histogram scroll

105

00:07:31,740  -->  00:07:38,160
down here and then see how you could create a histogram and it provides all the code for the examples

106

00:07:38,170  -->  00:07:38,590
.

107

00:07:39,270  -->  00:07:43,230
As you look through this page you'll notice that there's a lot of examples for other things you can

108

00:07:43,230  -->  00:07:44,430
do such as adding lines.

109

00:07:44,430  -->  00:07:53,220
The histogram here adding a facet adding a probability density to your histogram etc. and it's all done

110

00:07:53,220  -->  00:07:57,870
with cheesier plot to code and then just calling G-G plotly at the end.

111

00:07:57,870  -->  00:08:03,850
If you ever want to know in more detail what's been converted from G-G plot 2 to plot line.

112

00:08:04,140  -->  00:08:08,550
You'll see here a link that says see the Gigia plot 2 to partly test tables.

113

00:08:08,760  -->  00:08:15,510
If you click on that and open a new link it will take you to this page which is essentially all the

114

00:08:15,750  -->  00:08:21,260
plot to documentation images been converted to plotless code.

115

00:08:21,280  -->  00:08:25,010
Then you can go ahead and click on any of these if case you want another reference.

116

00:08:25,200  -->  00:08:30,300
Basically anything you could possibly think of referencing the code is here for you in this page.

117

00:08:30,450  -->  00:08:33,600
And again all of this is linked in the next lecture.

118

00:08:33,600  -->  00:08:38,850
All right hopefully you're excited now that all your knowledge of G-d Blut too can be easily converted

119

00:08:38,850  -->  00:08:41,030
to interact plot's.

120

00:08:41,040  -->  00:08:46,530
Thanks everyone I will see you at the next lecture which is just a brief text lecture with the links

121

00:08:46,620  -->  00:08:49,700
and a brief overview of everything we just discussed.
