00:00:01,440  -->  00:00:06,970
Hello everyone and we'll get to your first machine learning project the linear regression project or

2

00:00:06,990  -->  00:00:12,390
this specific project or what we're going to be doing is focusing a lot more on exploratory data analysis

3

00:00:12,750  -->  00:00:17,440
versus actually building a model as you progress through all the machine learning projects.

4

00:00:17,450  -->  00:00:23,250
We'll focus more on building the model and training and testing sets versus exploratory data analysis

5

00:00:23,250  -->  00:00:23,270
.

6

00:00:23,280  -->  00:00:28,470
But for now we'll start off slowly and check out exploring the data that you've never seen before using

7

00:00:28,470  -->  00:00:29,630
G-G plot two.

8

00:00:29,670  -->  00:00:34,800
And then finally at the end building the model let's go ahead and walk through the notebooks how to

9

00:00:34,800  -->  00:00:39,970
get the data and everything you'll be doing throughout the machine learning project.

10

00:00:39,990  -->  00:00:45,360
All right so here I am at this notebook here to have it open in the browser where you can open it however

11

00:00:45,360  -->  00:00:46,410
you want.

12

00:00:46,590  -->  00:00:53,340
This actual linear regression project notebook is labeled m l Dasch linear regression project and it's

13

00:00:53,370  -->  00:00:58,410
under the machine learning project folder which is under the training exercises folder.

14

00:00:58,410  -->  00:01:03,090
So if you're looking for this notebook go to training exercises machine learning projects and then select

15

00:01:03,160  -->  00:01:06,350
an L linear regression project.

16

00:01:06,600  -->  00:01:11,940
Don't select the solutions version of this lecture until after you've attempted it.

17

00:01:12,390  -->  00:01:15,200
This is what the linear regression project looks like for this project.

18

00:01:15,210  -->  00:01:19,460
We're going to be doing is exploring the bike sharing the man Kaggle challenge.

19

00:01:19,860  -->  00:01:23,400
We won't be somebody any of these results of the competition but feel free to explore.

20

00:01:23,400  -->  00:01:25,130
Kaggle or some people call it Kaggle.

21

00:01:25,200  -->  00:01:26,340
A little more in depth.

22

00:01:26,460  -->  00:01:30,780
If you ever heard of this go ahead and click on the link here in the notebook and it will take you to

23

00:01:30,780  -->  00:01:32,630
the actual competition page.

24

00:01:32,670  -->  00:01:36,830
If you're wondering what haggler Cagle is you can just go ahead and click here.

25

00:01:36,830  -->  00:01:36,990
Good.

26

00:01:37,020  -->  00:01:42,530
How about calm and Cavalier's basically a data science competition Web site.

27

00:01:42,570  -->  00:01:43,440
It's pretty interesting.

28

00:01:43,450  -->  00:01:46,970
I'm going to give you a brief rundown of what it is because we're actually going to be using some data

29

00:01:46,970  -->  00:01:51,370
sets from this Web site later on in other machine learning in projects.

30

00:01:51,500  -->  00:01:54,900
Do you go ahead and click on competitions from the main home page.

31

00:01:54,900  -->  00:01:59,820
You'll notice there's a bunch of active competitions and the basic premise here is that companies such

32

00:01:59,820  -->  00:02:07,920
as State Farm or Facebook or Airbnb etc. will post their data sets and will also post a particular question

33

00:02:07,920  -->  00:02:09,420
they're trying to solve.

34

00:02:09,420  -->  00:02:12,720
So for instance here we have State Farm distracted driver detection.

35

00:02:12,720  -->  00:02:18,870
If you click on that link will take you to this page and essentially they'll have a bunch of data and

36

00:02:18,870  -->  00:02:23,700
some sort of task they want you to perform here they want you to figure out if you can use computer

37

00:02:23,700  -->  00:02:26,850
vision to spot distracted drivers.

38

00:02:27,000  -->  00:02:32,760
If you do well on this competition and are a top performer there's actually monetary prizes associated

39

00:02:32,760  -->  00:02:34,060
with some of these competitions.

40

00:02:34,200  -->  00:02:41,820
In this case the top performing team will win $65000 if they have a top performing result that State

41

00:02:41,820  -->  00:02:43,710
Farm approves of.

42

00:02:43,890  -->  00:02:50,200
That's the monetary reason people would want to actually participate in these active competitions.

43

00:02:50,220  -->  00:02:53,210
There's other competitions that will lead to possible jobs.

44

00:02:53,310  -->  00:02:57,960
You notice here there's Facebook five predicting check ins you click on that link it'll take you to

45

00:02:57,990  -->  00:03:02,510
this competition which is I trying to identify the correct place for check ins.

46

00:03:02,730  -->  00:03:08,610
If you do well in this machine learning competition Facebook will actually offer you an interview to

47

00:03:08,670  -->  00:03:12,210
come to work on Facebook which is pretty cool.

48

00:03:12,210  -->  00:03:16,650
Finally if you're just looking to get started there are the knowledge competitions and these knowledge

49

00:03:16,650  -->  00:03:20,850
competitions are just for the sake of knowledge and practicing.

50

00:03:20,850  -->  00:03:25,590
This is the kind of competition we're entering for our very first machine learning project and it's

51

00:03:25,590  -->  00:03:27,160
the bike sharing demand.

52

00:03:27,330  -->  00:03:31,410
Like I mentioned before we're actually going to enter submit data we'll just be playing around this

53

00:03:31,410  -->  00:03:32,410
data set.

54

00:03:32,430  -->  00:03:39,150
You can download it here from the Web site or just use the BikeShare CAC file that's included with the

55

00:03:39,150  -->  00:03:43,350
repository of notes you keep scrolling down here.

56

00:03:43,350  -->  00:03:48,000
What you'll end up noticing is that there's a bikeshare that CC file and you'll eventually just use

57

00:03:48,030  -->  00:03:51,210
rethought CXXVI to read it as a data frame.

58

00:03:51,210  -->  00:03:56,010
All the information of what's actually going on in the BikeShare file as far as what the columns stand

59

00:03:56,010  -->  00:03:59,220
for and what they represent is all here in the notebook.

60

00:03:59,220  -->  00:04:03,840
So for instance if you're confused as to what the season numbers stand for you would just come to notebook

61

00:04:03,900  -->  00:04:09,750
and understand that one is spring to a summer of fall for winter etc. then you're just going to go to

62

00:04:09,750  -->  00:04:14,960
this notebook and try to figure out the tasks in bold go ahead and work through them.

63

00:04:15,000  -->  00:04:19,230
First he'll check the head of the DMF then you try to figure out what is the target we're trying to

64

00:04:19,230  -->  00:04:20,010
predict.

65

00:04:20,010  -->  00:04:22,990
You can check the cagily or Kaggle link if you're confused on that.

66

00:04:23,250  -->  00:04:27,780
Essentially you would just click here read through this and realize that you must predict the total

67

00:04:27,780  -->  00:04:31,460
counts of bikes rented during each hour covered by the set.

68

00:04:32,090  -->  00:04:32,530
OK.

69

00:04:32,730  -->  00:04:37,200
And if you know here we have a county column that's essentially or trying to predict using linear regression

70

00:04:38,820  -->  00:04:43,130
then and this is the main focus of this project is the exploratory data analysis.

71

00:04:43,200  -->  00:04:45,380
I want you to try to recreate some plots.

72

00:04:45,480  -->  00:04:48,720
Don't worry about getting too fancy of the colors of the themes.

73

00:04:48,720  -->  00:04:53,970
These are fancier plots with scale colors and custom themes to them.

74

00:04:54,060  -->  00:04:59,420
Just try to get the basic plot down and then have fun and explore as you plot further.

75

00:04:59,460  -->  00:05:04,170
If you really like data visualization if you don't actually like data visualization too much just get

76

00:05:04,170  -->  00:05:09,180
the basic plot working you want you to create a scatterplot of count versus 10.

77

00:05:09,600  -->  00:05:15,780
Then you can go ahead and move on and you'll want to plot count versus date time and you'll actually

78

00:05:15,780  -->  00:05:20,700
have to convert that date time column into posek C-T formatting before plotting.

79

00:05:20,730  -->  00:05:23,000
So go ahead and do that.

80

00:05:23,130  -->  00:05:29,730
And here is a nicer plot with some color scale variation to try to indicate temperature versus actual

81

00:05:29,730  -->  00:05:30,580
dates.

82

00:05:31,080  -->  00:05:35,970
And from this exploratory data analysis which will end up realizing is that there's a seasonality to

83

00:05:35,970  -->  00:05:36,560
the data.

84

00:05:36,600  -->  00:05:41,400
And this is discussed more in these solutions video walk there and you'll realize that there are some

85

00:05:41,400  -->  00:05:44,600
pros and some definite cons to using linear regression.

86

00:05:44,730  -->  00:05:49,710
And in fact linear regression will end up not being such a super great algorithm given the seasonality

87

00:05:49,710  -->  00:05:54,520
of the data then you'll be asked what's the correlation between 10 and count.

88

00:05:54,570  -->  00:05:59,190
He'll explore the season data a little more by recreating this box but like I mentioned before I worry

89

00:05:59,190  -->  00:06:00,540
too much about the colors of the theme.

90

00:06:00,540  -->  00:06:06,150
Just try to get the basic box plot working then you'll do a little bit of feature engineering trying

91

00:06:06,150  -->  00:06:12,360
to create in our column from the date time column and then you create a scatterplot of count versus

92

00:06:12,420  -->  00:06:15,090
our with some additional options free to check out.

93

00:06:15,180  -->  00:06:19,680
Again don't worry about getting this plot looking exactly like the solutions without checking out the

94

00:06:19,680  -->  00:06:20,540
solutions first.

95

00:06:20,550  -->  00:06:26,930
But just try to get the basics working then you'll create the same plot for non-working days.

96

00:06:26,940  -->  00:06:34,470
So what we have here is a plot for the bike usage with colored by temperature but also by the hour of

97

00:06:34,470  -->  00:06:39,270
the day on the x axis for our work days which means a lot of people are leaving on their bike in the

98

00:06:39,270  -->  00:06:44,850
morning and then leaving on their bike when it's time to go home at 5 p.m. and maybe some lunch breaks

99

00:06:44,850  -->  00:06:46,090
in between.

100

00:06:46,240  -->  00:06:50,730
This for non-working days on the weekend you can see there's like this gradual rise during the middle

101

00:06:50,730  -->  00:06:54,430
of the afternoon and it dies off slowly.

102

00:06:54,570  -->  00:06:59,940
Finally after all that you'll build your model and the here you'll just use the Elham function that

103

00:06:59,940  -->  00:07:02,890
we showed in the lectures to actually build out your model.

104

00:07:03,060  -->  00:07:07,460
You'll get the summary of the model and you keep working through this.

105

00:07:07,470  -->  00:07:14,160
Then you'll ASP's to be you'll be asked to use the model try to predict counts of bike rentals.

106

00:07:14,250  -->  00:07:15,800
You'll continue on.

107

00:07:15,840  -->  00:07:19,000
Create another model that uses other features to predict.

108

00:07:19,140  -->  00:07:20,870
Then get a summary of the model.

109

00:07:21,060  -->  00:07:26,400
Read through it and eventually what you'll end up discovering is that due to the time series nature

110

00:07:26,400  -->  00:07:32,220
of the data actually splitting the data randomly into training and test sets doesn't really make sense

111

00:07:32,700  -->  00:07:39,390
because since it's a time series data what you actually want to do is split the data using test as future

112

00:07:39,390  -->  00:07:41,760
data and train as past data.

113

00:07:41,760  -->  00:07:44,740
Previously we used C.A. tools to do a random split.

114

00:07:44,790  -->  00:07:47,430
Here you would want to do a non-random split.

115

00:07:47,430  -->  00:07:52,550
This is an optional assignment for this machine learning project to try to create this train test split

116

00:07:52,940  -->  00:07:56,730
but we don't actually go into it too much since we're just starting off machine learning.

117

00:07:56,730  -->  00:08:02,850
Later on we'll discover other data sets that are better for training and test split and will come back

118

00:08:02,850  -->  00:08:08,640
to this and try to realize if we can use something that's not linear regression to make a better model

119

00:08:08,880  -->  00:08:10,340
to fit this data.

120

00:08:10,380  -->  00:08:10,910
All right.

121

00:08:11,130  -->  00:08:13,480
That's a brief overview of what you're going to be doing.

122

00:08:13,500  -->  00:08:16,190
Go ahead and get started the machine learning project.

123

00:08:16,200  -->  00:08:17,160
I hope you enjoy it.

124

00:08:17,190  -->  00:08:22,510
Take your time have fun with it and go as far as Long far along as you want to.

125

00:08:22,830  -->  00:08:25,480
In this state a machine learning project.

126

00:08:25,500  -->  00:08:27,180
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture
