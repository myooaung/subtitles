00:00:00,660  -->  00:00:05,070
Hello everyone and welcome to the lecture on Matrix selection and indexing.

2

00:00:05,070  -->  00:00:09,840
So just like with doctors we're going to be able to use the square bracket notation to select elements

3

00:00:10,020  -->  00:00:11,250
from a matrix.

4

00:00:11,250  -->  00:00:14,180
Let's go ahead and jump to our studio to see how this works.

5

00:00:14,670  -->  00:00:15,000
OK.

6

00:00:15,000  -->  00:00:20,430
So here are studio and let's go ahead and get a quick reminder of how we can use indexing for a vector

7

00:00:20,680  -->  00:00:21,040
.

8

00:00:21,080  -->  00:00:30,420
Imagine had a vector V of the elements 1 2 3 4 5 index and number two I would simply use square brackets

9

00:00:30,480  -->  00:00:34,040
and then put the index position where the element I want back.

10

00:00:34,080  -->  00:00:37,770
Or it could also put in the name if the vector was named.

11

00:00:37,800  -->  00:00:43,020
Now for matrices since we're dealing of two them mentions we'll need to use a comma to separate or indexing

12

00:00:43,020  -->  00:00:44,460
for each dimension.

13

00:00:44,460  -->  00:00:47,390
So let's go ahead and show you what this looks like.

14

00:00:47,400  -->  00:00:53,100
First off we'll start by making a matrix called Matt.

15

00:00:53,190  -->  00:00:59,530
The matrix function as a numeric sequential vector 1 through 50.

16

00:00:59,930  -->  00:01:03,110
We'll say by RHO is equal to false.

17

00:01:03,210  -->  00:01:11,250
Actually true excuse me and I'll specify the number of rows to be equal to 5.

18

00:01:11,580  -->  00:01:16,010
So it's going to take a look at that matrix real quick.

19

00:01:16,140  -->  00:01:21,690
So because my font's a little larger here it's going to be split into two parts but it is all just one

20

00:01:21,690  -->  00:01:27,900
matrix that's a 5 by 10 matrix so there's five rows with 10 columns here.

21

00:01:28,010  -->  00:01:33,990
You'll notice here that there's a square bracket index notation for the columns and the rows and that's

22

00:01:33,990  -->  00:01:38,560
the same kind of rotation we're going to be using when we select from this matrix.

23

00:01:38,580  -->  00:01:40,450
So let's go ahead and get started.

24

00:01:40,520  -->  00:01:43,780
The men really wanted to grab the first row.

25

00:01:43,920  -->  00:01:50,070
So for Matrix indexing notation what you're going to do for the square brackets is your first going

26

00:01:50,070  -->  00:01:56,970
to pass in the rows you want to if I just want the first row I'll put in one then you put a comma and

27

00:01:56,970  -->  00:02:01,580
then you pass in the columns you want if you want everything you just leave it blank.

28

00:02:01,590  -->  00:02:06,960
So if I want the first row that's going to return that first row for me.

29

00:02:06,960  -->  00:02:10,160
Let's go ahead and see what that looks like one more time.

30

00:02:10,170  -->  00:02:15,760
So I notice the first row was the numbers 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and 10.

31

00:02:16,110  -->  00:02:24,940
So if I say first one comma nothing then I'm going to return all the columns for the first row.

32

00:02:24,960  -->  00:02:25,580
Great.

33

00:02:25,830  -->  00:02:30,720
Let's go ahead and see how I can grab the first column.

34

00:02:30,720  -->  00:02:34,580
So the first column is going to be nothing.

35

00:02:34,630  -->  00:02:36,460
Comma 1.

36

00:02:36,540  -->  00:02:43,740
Now what this means is grab everything all the rows from the first column so that in return will bring

37

00:02:43,740  -->  00:02:45,460
back the first column.

38

00:02:45,810  -->  00:02:47,850
So in general we can think of this.

39

00:02:47,910  -->  00:02:54,030
If I just go and take this in our script as something that looks like this we'll have some matrix and

40

00:02:54,030  -->  00:02:56,560
then we specify which rose we want.

41

00:02:56,750  -->  00:03:00,760
If a comma and then we specify specify which columns we want.

42

00:03:01,050  -->  00:03:04,320
So it goes Rose comma column within the square brackets.

43

00:03:04,320  -->  00:03:09,930
And if you want all the rows or all the columns you're just going to go ahead and leave that blank.

44

00:03:09,960  -->  00:03:13,980
So let's go ahead and see what else we can do here.

45

00:03:13,980  -->  00:03:18,140
Imagine you wanted to grab the first three rows of a matrix.

46

00:03:18,260  -->  00:03:23,160
Well we would just say Matrix name but the square brackets in there.

47

00:03:23,160  -->  00:03:26,280
And here we can use this slicing notation.

48

00:03:26,280  -->  00:03:33,120
So one colon three that's going to return 1 2 and 3 for the rows and then I'm going to leave a comma

49

00:03:33,150  -->  00:03:39,750
there because I want all the values for those rows every column value for those three rows and then

50

00:03:39,750  -->  00:03:44,700
we can see that it gets returned those three rows for all 10 columns.

51

00:03:44,730  -->  00:03:46,060
All right great.

52

00:03:46,080  -->  00:03:51,650
So let's go ahead and take a look at our matrix one more time.

53

00:03:51,840  -->  00:03:53,560
So we have this matrix Matt.

54

00:03:54,030  -->  00:03:57,110
It's 10 columns by five rows.

55

00:03:57,120  -->  00:04:02,930
Imagine I want it to grab let's say just the top left right rectangle So that's going to be let's say

56

00:04:02,950  -->  00:04:07,140
just want to grab one two three and 11 12 13.

57

00:04:07,190  -->  00:04:08,780
I would actually do that.

58

00:04:08,880  -->  00:04:12,510
So I'm going to say Matt square brackets.

59

00:04:12,660  -->  00:04:15,540
I want to go ahead and grab that left top left rectangle.

60

00:04:15,600  -->  00:04:18,570
So it's going to be looks like the first two rows.

61

00:04:18,590  -->  00:04:21,730
So it's I want one two three and 11 12 13.

62

00:04:21,900  -->  00:04:23,560
So gonna go ahead and put in the first two rows.

63

00:04:23,550  -->  00:04:27,450
So that's one goal and two for that slice of the first two rows.

64

00:04:27,780  -->  00:04:30,520
And I also want the first three columns.

65

00:04:30,540  -->  00:04:31,560
One two three.

66

00:04:31,560  -->  00:04:34,420
So that's going to be one comma three.

67

00:04:35,700  -->  00:04:36,420
And there you have it.

68

00:04:36,420  -->  00:04:39,780
We have that rectangle back that top left rectangle.

69

00:04:40,320  -->  00:04:44,640
OK let's go ahead and just show two more quick examples.

70

00:04:44,640  -->  00:04:47,410
Imagine I wanted to grab the last two columns.

71

00:04:47,670  -->  00:04:51,270
I could do Matt since I want just columns.

72

00:04:51,270  -->  00:04:53,070
That means I want all the rows for it.

73

00:04:53,080  -->  00:04:57,600
So going to put a comma and I'm going to go to specify columns 9 through 10.

74

00:04:57,600  -->  00:04:59,380
So those are the last two columns.

75

00:04:59,760  -->  00:05:00,600
And there you have it.

76

00:05:00,600  -->  00:05:02,870
We have the last two columns there.

77

00:05:02,970  -->  00:05:05,710
Let's show one more example of this.

78

00:05:05,820  -->  00:05:08,390
Go ahead and see what the map looks like.

79

00:05:08,400  -->  00:05:11,310
Imagine you want it to grab let's say just a center square.

80

00:05:11,310  -->  00:05:15,200
So I want 15 16 and 25 26.

81

00:05:15,240  -->  00:05:23,100
I want this square in the matrix when I go ahead and say mats and let's see we're going to need the

82

00:05:23,100  -->  00:05:31,560
rows for 15 16 25 26 will need two and three are going to go and slice rows two for three comma.

83

00:05:31,620  -->  00:05:36,240
Then I'm going to do the columns in this case looks like it's five through six and you can notice.

84

00:05:36,240  -->  00:05:42,230
Now hopefully this notation starts to make sense as to why our studios are reporting it as blank.

85

00:05:42,240  -->  00:05:46,460
Comma 5 because this stands for all the rows in column 5.

86

00:05:46,500  -->  00:05:48,560
Likewise for the rows.

87

00:05:48,570  -->  00:05:52,780
It's going to be the row comma blank because it's all the columns for the first row.

88

00:05:52,800  -->  00:05:59,400
So if I go ahead and run this it returns back that square from the Matrix.

89

00:05:59,400  -->  00:06:00,060
OK.

90

00:06:00,240  -->  00:06:05,020
So that's it as far as the general syntax for grabbing chunks from the Matrix.

91

00:06:05,140  -->  00:06:10,950
But I encourage you to do is just go ahead and pick out with your eyes some gen's rectangles or rows

92

00:06:10,950  -->  00:06:15,540
or columns from our general matrix here and see if you can index them correctly.

93

00:06:15,630  -->  00:06:22,290
So maybe try grabbing the rectangle here 33 through 35 and 43 for 45.

94

00:06:22,290  -->  00:06:23,780
See if you can grab that rectangle.

95

00:06:23,790  -->  00:06:24,930
How would you do it.

96

00:06:24,950  -->  00:06:26,230
Just go ahead and practice.

97

00:06:26,280  -->  00:06:30,240
Choose some rectangles or squares in the matrix and see if you can index them out.

98

00:06:30,600  -->  00:06:31,500
OK.

99

00:06:31,500  -->  00:06:33,860
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
