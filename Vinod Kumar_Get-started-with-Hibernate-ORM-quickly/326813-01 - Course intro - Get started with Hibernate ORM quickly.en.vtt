00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.820
However,

00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:08.220
it is an object relation mapping or warm toe developed in 2001 by giving King along with

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.150
his collects from serious technologies.

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:11.100
Today,

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.050
even after almost two decades,

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:17.650
it's still the first choice by many developers for connecting Java applications with RDP

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:24.510
Anus job roadworks jdb See as an EPA for connecting your job applications with any

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:30.930
arguments in a vendor independent faction as long as you have a GBC or a user name and

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:35.820
password to the database on a driver class name typically prodded by the DB window,

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.210
the GBC Cody right need not militant specific toe.

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.160
Nrd BMS.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.390
Generally we worked with indeedy object like products,

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:44.030
customers,

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.540
employees,

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.990
etcetera.

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:50.980
But to get the leader stored in an argument stable as Rose in Jammeh's object format,

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:57.070
we have to read lots of boilerplate redundant for also there lots of impotence.

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.210
Mismatch between the concepts of arguments and concepts are OBE.

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:02.800
For example,

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.880
tables in an arguments have primary key foreign key relationships,

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.150
while objects have aggregation,

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:09.900
inheritance,

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:10.680
polymorphism,

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.240
etcetera,

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.700
hiding it as a water implementation provide solution toe almost all such impotence

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.430
mismatches I've been.

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.040
It also employed additional features like ASCII,

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.120
lazy loading,

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.770
dirty reads to improve the performance.

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:31.010
Hi manage maybe a user interface concession which provides the credit operations in the

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:37.550
form of functions like forces get march or delete for intruding into the objects based on

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:38.670
various criteria.

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.830
There is another interface called Quiet.

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:46.260
We will be covering all these major aspects in this course so that human quickly get

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.650
started with any Hibernian water project.

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.150
So let's get started with softer set up.
