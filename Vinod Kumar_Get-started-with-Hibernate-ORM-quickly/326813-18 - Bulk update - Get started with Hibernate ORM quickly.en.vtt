00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.710
Hibernate Query Land,

00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:05.170
which also supports Park Update and Beat.

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:06.430
For example,

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:11.630
if you want being list the price off all the products by $1 then you can use this feature

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:12.720
to the monster.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:13.360
The same.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:22.400
Let's go and comment on this and write a new function called increment product price fight

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.850
and that I'm Melissa play.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.820
What is the amount by which you on increment I'm gonna supply,

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:28.170
say,

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.060
for example,

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:34.440
1.0 saying that inclement the product price by $1 we don't have this functions.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.510
I'm gonna create a new one and then changes toe i e N c.

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.780
May be available for representing increments price now in arable increment.

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.120
This I can say your string X Q.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.430
A equals toe update p capital product Because it's the name of the class,

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:59.760
not the name of the table set unit price equals toe the current unit price,

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.270
plus probably a parameter called I N C.

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:07.360
Price And this I N C.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.150
The rightly Syria's function argument must be supplied Over here.

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:16.400
We simply say your cure y equals tow session dark.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.980
Create quality.

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:22.960
This time we don't have to really worry about type off the later that we want because we're

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.010
not gonna do any data from the DP.

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:26.680
This is my Curiel,

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:27.550
Andi.

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.330
I simply cleared a quietly object just like that.

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:31.530
I can say quietly,

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.000
Lord set parameter.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.270
And then the perimeter name is I N c.

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.910
Price.

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:37.880
The value happens to be a GNC.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:44.170
And then I have to say you're quietly dot execute update district Since the number of rows

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.710
affected So I can always stay pure count,

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:52.620
it calls to press control one our command one who attended that variable and then I can

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.750
take your Tortola off.

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:04.340
Cohn bardos off data before we run this there is one another thing that we have to do.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.910
We have toe do this in a transactional boundary.

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:10.540
So I'm going to say here somewhere in the beginning,

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:11.970
session door,

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.060
begin transaction on,

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.720
and after executing,

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.980
I'm gonna say your session don't get the current transaction on,

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.110
then come into the scene.

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:27.290
I really we should start on all these statements inside a try block and then in the catch

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.590
blood.

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.660
We should also do it all back before running the court.

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.910
Let's go and see what prices we have for the products first few off the McGuinty.

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.460
$18.19 dollars.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:38.340
$10.

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.300
If I go and run this program now,

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.150
I should see that there are 77 products updated.

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.970
If I go here and then read on this,

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:53.680
you should see that it is $19.20 dollars and $11 before on this once more again,

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.520
it's going to be updated with the new price.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.540
I'll come back here and read on this.

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.350
It changes from 1920 11 toe 2021 12.
