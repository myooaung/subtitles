00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.090
the quite a aloes is to retrieve data based on imagination as well,

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:10.890
to demonstrate the same that's going to come in this and write a new function called Get

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:13.300
Products by page.

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.750
Let's apply the page number as three,

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.890
assuming that each page has been products.

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:27.350
So it is like page number recalls to three on the size happens to be the 10.

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:29.710
If you want to supply that.

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.030
Also here that is fine,

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:33.550
but I just want to supply the page number here.

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.070
Since the function doesn't exist,

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.280
it's giving me a quick fix call,

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.350
create medical,

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.850
get products by page a selected press tab.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.110
Select the package level,

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.180
then why it is fine with me and then this is India's.

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:50.130
Also Okay,

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.490
I'm gonna call this as page numb and press enter.

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.590
So we about the function body ready here.

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:57.080
First,

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.660
let's act the quality,

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.700
which is string excuse because toe from product,

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.770
I don't need to do anything else over here because I want to say give me on the products.

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.750
But not specifying the limit and offset over here.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.850
I'm gonna assume the limit to be around 10.

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.450
But offset is based on the page number.

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.550
So if I want to read through the details of the page number three,

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:30.170
I should start from 21 toe 30 which means I have to skip the 1st 2 20 records.

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:31.820
So if this is yen,

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.560
I have to say end minus one in tow.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:41.150
Limit seven of type here in offset equals toe page numb minus one.

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:42.950
Deployed by the limit.

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.290
Now I can supply this dollar quietus.

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:46.750
I'm gonna copy this part.

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.330
The store here against a query lord,

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.390
set first result toe the offset.

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.320
And then I save your radar,

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.100
said Max.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.260
Result toe the limit.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:07.150
And all I have to do is to get this list and then looked with that and printed idiots

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.080
instead of displaying the broader name and price.

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.350
I also like to say,

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.820
Peter,

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.250
get product ivy,

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.960
plus some hyphen.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:17.850
Plus,

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.160
the reason is that ideas are automatically Arnold over here,

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.210
which means I will be able to know that I am actually getting the rate of from the page

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.890
number three.

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.170
So save and run the theme.

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.870
I should not see the page number three details were 21 to 30.

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.090
Products have been displayed.

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:36.650
If I go here and say,

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.510
Give me the page number Fine.

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:39.840
I should know,

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.940
See from 41 to 50 and it's giving the result as expected.
