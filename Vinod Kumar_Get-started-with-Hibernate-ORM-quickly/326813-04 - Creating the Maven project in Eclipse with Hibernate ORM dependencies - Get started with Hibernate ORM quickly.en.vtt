00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.790
So here are open eclipse.

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.240
It's a brand new workspace,

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:06.140
as you can see that there are no projects.

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:11.870
So let's quickly get started with the Eclipse Maimon project by going toe five new and then

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:17.190
say May 1 project in the first Del about I'm gonna click on this creates simple project by

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:18.290
skipping archetypes.

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:20.360
Election Next,

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:21.810
the group I d.

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.830
I can do anything that identifies my company or my organization.

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:28.500
I'm gonna take your quarter,

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.290
we know which is the river itself.

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.860
My website.

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.320
We know dot co artifact early and review it as a favor.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.530
Need dot trainee and then I take on finish and the human project is now created here.

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:41.820
For some reason,

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.150
May 1 sets the projects.

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:44.780
Gvk Washington Wonder five.

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:50.660
Let's first change that to wonder eight by going toe project properties Java,

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.550
build pot and then go to the library's notice Here.

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:54.860
It says,

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.540
Gtsi wondered if I double click on the same and then from the drop down,

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.060
I'm gonna select jittery Asi Wonder eight and then say finish,

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:08.960
since you're gonna connect our job application to the hedge to database server that's also

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.930
at the Type four driver.

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.150
Why are this ad external job.

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:18.690
I go to my home directory here and then there is a hitch to under hits.

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:26.710
Two There's a big and then they're they're hitch toe one dot for 1.0.1 $97 Job click on

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.650
apply in close and it's been added Toe our libraries over here.

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:32.660
Now,

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:34.300
since you're working with May 1,

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:40.210
you might be wondering that Why didn't I acted in our ponder xml for some unknown reason

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:46.130
This hedge to job when it is downloaded from maybe repository somehow it does not work.

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.880
So I have to state that you can also go ahead and give it a try.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.750
But it doesn't work.

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.050
You come back and at this as the reference that I'm sure since we're gonna work with

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.760
hibernate,

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.750
we have to add the hibernate jobs as dependencies.

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.260
So I'm gonna open the damn door.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.730
XML,

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:03.370
go to the prom girl,

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:06.570
XML time here where I can actually get the source score.

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:12.840
I'm gonna add a section your card dependencies and inside the dependence is I have Are they

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.160
hibernate dependency to do so?

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:21.950
Let's go to the browser and go toe envy and repository dot com and search for hibernate.

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:27.250
And the very 1st 1 says Hibernate court here from our hibernate.

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:28.250
This is what we want.

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.590
I kick on the hibernate court here on I would like to select the latest question which is

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.250
fighting for one final.

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.990
I go there and take on this section toe.

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:40.270
Copy that dependency.

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.650
Come back to my maven based it on,

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:45.900
then save it.

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.190
As soon as I save it,

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.350
you should see that it don't lose the necessary jar files from the Internet.

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.170
If you already have downloaded,

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.170
like in my case,

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:55.650
it has done quickly,

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.880
so you can see there under May win differences.

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.670
I have all the jobs that are required for hibernate five applications.
