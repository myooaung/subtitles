00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.320
Now that the project has been set up,

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:05.780
let's close all these minimize our project.

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:10.780
And let's add a new job class under SRC Main Java,

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:15.010
which is gonna be an entity class representing eventually the table data.

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:18.060
So I'm gonna call this as a category.

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.010
So I go toe new class and then add a package,

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.910
name your cold start entity and then call the class them here as category.

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:32.590
This is a plain ordinary Jolla plants or poor Joe.

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.090
Let me increase the phone stays a bit.

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.030
Here,

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.580
let's assume that we have a category I category name and a description off the category.

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.970
So for representing the same,

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:45.980
I'm gonna be a few variables.

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:46.660
Five.

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:47.500
Great indeed.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:48.540
Your degree.

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.350
I d five extreme getting really need.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.800
And by registering decision,

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.550
I will also add a default constructor.

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.950
I can do so by pressing control space and then look for the constructor.

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:10.810
Get your after to do here Also at the gate Doesn't sitters for all this so that the play

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.360
with members are accessible outside of this class.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.250
I goto source menu generate getters and centers.

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.570
Select all of them so that get US ancestors are selected over here,

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:22.610
I say OK,

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:23.990
also,

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.360
I would like to add the posting function so when I get a category object that can print it

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:34.400
out so I go to the source Middle generate ustream Already all the members have been

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.070
selected.

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.710
I click on OK toe,

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:42.610
generate the to string function so we want hyping it to create tables corresponding toe our

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:43.700
entity classes.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.510
We can do that by mapping this category.

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:53.760
Torch our toe category stable on mapping these variables Toe appropriate column names off

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:59.260
our table Now I've been it will read this information and then automatically create the

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.230
tables are update the tables if needed to do so.

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:09.420
First we have are here at the red entity and then at the rate table name of the people we

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.980
want this to be map is categories.

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.490
I also have to do an import.

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:20.830
I can press command shift on Mac are control shift on windows to get that automatically

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:21.500
imported.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.780
Whenever there is a name conflict between multiple classes from different packages,

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:32.980
this dialog box comes and then I can choose this from the list I said next and then Java

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.200
expert systems stable.

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:40.470
It's a Finnish 100 entity just gives an identity for this particular class that it is a

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:41.950
special class for happen it.

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.400
So I've been It should manage also in the absence off the table,

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:52.140
the added into the annotation match this class to a table with the same name.

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.150
So since we wanted the table to be included,

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.270
all I had to use a different animation called Moderate Table.

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:04.250
In case if your field names are different than the column means you can also map them by

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:05.680
adding color.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.290
Name equals toe category.

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.990
Underscore 80 similar leg and figure at the right column.

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:16.330
Name equals toe category underscored me for description.

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.590
I'm not going to mention that by before.

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.370
Hibernating will automatically map all the fields toe appropriate column names.

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:24.110
In this case,

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:28.970
it will map this string description field to a column called Description.

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:30.460
So once again,

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:32.810
in order to import the outdated column,

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.990
I'm gonna press command shift or on automatically it acts that toe my imports.

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:41.560
One last thing that we have to do here is to map one off.

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.270
These three feeds toe a primary key off the table.

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:46.930
Generally,

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:52.860
the ID's like Category 80 your product ready are going to be mapped for that on I'll have

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:59.110
to do is to say after a I D and import that from Java Expert Assistance Package.

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:04.850
We can also ask High Benetto automatically generate the ideas based on certain logics.

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:05.730
For this,

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.950
I have to add another innovation called activated generated value.

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:11.600
And then I say here,

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.700
strategy equals toe.

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.160
There are four strategies.

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.940
As you can see,

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:22.110
Arto identity sequence and table identity means the column corresponding two days will have

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:24.410
an auto underscore increment feature.

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:25.850
So I'm gonna select it.

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:26.850
Andi,

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:30.340
say this now or category into the class is ready.
