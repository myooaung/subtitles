WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=LOCAL:00:00:00.000,MPEGTS:0

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.930
know that we have the session factory on the interdict class.

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:07.470
Let's go and create a new program toe.

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.110
Add a new category toe over database table to do so.

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:16.910
Let's go and create a new Gela class under a new package called Programs.

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:19.130
I'm gonna call this as new Class,

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.640
but change the package toe programs on that.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.350
This is gonna be my first example program,

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:33.150
so call it as you 01 It's called Us Main and then also at a public static wide main click

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:34.050
on Finish.

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.060
We now have a program.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:37.910
It's full screen this on.

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.750
Get it off this to do now I want to say a new category into the database table.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:43.740
Remember,

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.530
we don't have the table yet.

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:53.780
Let's create a category object by typing category C one equals two new category imported

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.850
from our own into the package on Stevie Wonder said category Name,

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:04.400
Toe That's a beverages and then I'm gonna die Pure C one dot said description.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:04.810
Let's say,

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:05.620
for example,

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.380
is a coffee tea etcetera?

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:09.810
No,

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:10.280
it is.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.680
I do not have an idea at this point in time.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.180
Safe princey one dot get category idea.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.600
It's gonna give me a value.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.580
I want Haibin it automatically gender tidy.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.030
Based on the strategy that were given,

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.230
which is called identity,

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:26.680
the first thing that we want to do is toe get session factories.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.450
I'm gonna type your factory equals toe.

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.830
You didn't Don't get session factory.

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.400
I have not created this valuable off any data type,

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.040
so that's why I'm getting an error.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.700
All I have to do is to press command one on Mac control one on windows and it will

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:44.680
automatically say,

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.710
create a local variable car factory.

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.020
And when I pressed enter based on the return type off,

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.050
get session factory it will associate this variable with their type,

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.720
also automatically imports that Cyprus enter a.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:03.680
Now you can see that it has important that it created a valuable using that since we store

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.110
the factory in the service registry in the hibernate duty,

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.360
it is important that you closed the factory at the end of this program even if there was an

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.910
exception.

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.930
So I'm gonna put a try with finally block and then inside the finally block,

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:23.400
I'm gonna say factory dark clothes so that even if there were any exceptions,

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.190
the fact that it gets automatically closed now,

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.060
in orderto save the category into the database,

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:34.350
we have to say session it calls toe factory Dark open session.

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.070
The fact that leader open station returns they hibernated station,

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.050
which represents a DB connection.

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.190
Since I did not create the valuable station with the data type,

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:44.210
it's giving me another.

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:45.650
Like in the previous case,

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.710
I'm gonna best command one press tender and I got decision here and session being imported

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:51.280
here as well.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.880
If you want to perform insert update our idiot,

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.380
which are Deimel statements,

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.190
you must put those statements in a transactional boundary,

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.170
which means you're a beginner transaction and in the production by calling,

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:05.350
commit or roll back.

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:09.290
High blood station provides a function called begin transaction,

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.170
which creates a transaction object so I can simply say station dark begin transaction

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:20.360
assigned this year available called DX press command Oneto import and clear the variable

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:21.120
automatically.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.000
Now that we have a transaction variable,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.330
let's put a try catch block on,

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.210
then inside the try catch block.

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:31.660
Let's try saving this in order to say the category object.

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.390
I simply say station dot persist and then I see one,

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:39.620
which is a category object If there is successfully done,

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.030
I want toe commit.

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.050
If there is any other I want to roll back.

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:47.550
So if this is successfully saved,

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:51.650
I want to tell the user that category object has been saved by Pierre.

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:59.450
New category saved with Heidi And then I take your C wonder get category I d remember

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:03.190
earlier I mentioned that at this point and then we have not said the i d.

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:04.070
So if we say see,

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.410
wondered,

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:08.160
get category 80 I would've gotten now but at this point in time,

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.500
it has already been inserted into the TV.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:15.980
The newly generated idea has already been retreated on hibernate already has set the idea

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:16.750
for C one.

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:18.840
Now all I'm doing is getting that I d.

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.240
But in case there was any problem,

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:26.430
it will go to the catch block runs back the transaction and then I type your system.

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.190
That off guard Wendelin did wasn't headed.

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:34.610
Why saving knew better.

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.400
And if I wanted to give the message,

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.750
I can also say here he dot get message.

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:44.120
So let's say this on run the same.

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.530
But just before running,

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:50.200
we will go to the TB client here connect to our database.

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.190
Notice I don't have any table called categories.

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:56.050
So let's run this and check if it's gonna work.

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:57.040
When I run this,

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:01.040
you may see that it is an insert statement.

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.230
But I didn't see a create table command,

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:04.520
and it's also giving me an error,

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.080
saying that table category is not form.

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:13.820
This is probably an adult because off my hibernate util get session factory here and the

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:18.430
property year is hibernate or hedge being totally deal dot Otto.

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:19.780
I missed that part.

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:24.450
I stay this close this go back to the program and reading that once more.

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:29.570
And I should not see that there is a clear Table command which clears the table core

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:34.800
categories and then inserts that It also gave me a message saying that new categories here

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:40.850
with I d one Let's go to the DB client here and click on the refresh button over here and

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:43.160
you see that there is a category stable creator.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:43.950
I click on this.

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:46.040
It shows me select start from categories,

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:50.790
a kick on a run and you can see that the newly inserted category from the General program

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:51.990
appears over here
