00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.430
in Java.

00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:04.040
Objects associations are unit directional,

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.150
which means if product has a minute to one association with category,

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:12.740
it does not imply that category also has an association with product.

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:13.630
On the contrary,

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:14.760
in arguments,

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.890
if you have a foreign key in one table,

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:23.290
you can travels in both the direction in orderto have this bidirectional association here,

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:25.650
we have to go to the category door Java,

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.930
and then clear the variable here that represents all the products that belonged toe a

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:31.920
single category.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.260
So when a single category object is obtained,

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:36.070
for example,

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:36.890
beverages.

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.440
I would like to get all the products corresponding to this for this.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:47.530
Let's come here and then clear a variable called list off product and then holidays

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:48.410
products.

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:55.770
Make sure that you important list from job order you till and then I'm a corresponding get

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:56.560
their sectors.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.640
You can move the cursor on this product and then say create,

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.840
get incentive for products are arguably select.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.630
This who the source Manu generate gators and centers automatically that's selected on.

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.460
I wouldn't say that after the last one here,

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:14.030
I said,

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.580
Okay,

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:15.450
it's been added,

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.360
but again,

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:22.120
if you do not map this with any direct column or anything hibernate automatically assumes

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.100
that products is going to be a new column in category.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.300
But it fails because this is not a scale are tape again.

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.720
And we know that this is not gonna be a new column anyway in the category,

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.770
because we already have a column corresponding to this association in the products table.

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.740
So we want to use the same thing.

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.980
All we have to do is tow.

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.060
Add an annotation here for one too many,

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:54.870
and then we say your joint column with the name off category underscoring now it is

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:55.410
important.

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.800
Oh,

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:01.110
note that the giant column here does not mean that the giant column is going to be in the

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:01.300
car.

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.330
Ticketed Orjuela.

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.920
This column is going to be looked in the product stable,

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:06.980
and if it doesn't exist,

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:08.210
it's going to create a new one.

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:09.560
Ultimately,

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:15.250
we can skip this and then say that the product already hasn't many to an association,

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.380
and we want to use the same giant information for this association.

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:20.960
Also for that,

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:27.360
you might have to say your math Dubai equals toe the name of the member that has the many

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.330
to one Association.

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.150
So if you go to the product or job,

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.850
did you see that the many tone association is on a variable called category?

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.650
So this is the name that we have to give you as map divide.

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.300
So I'm gonna save this.

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:46.320
Now we have one too many association Before we read a problem toe check.

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.370
If this is working,

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:54.360
let's go door db I already have added some data into my products table.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.690
I also have added fuel values to category stable,

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.180
also with eight different categories.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.780
Now,

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.490
I conveyed my program toe,

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:07.670
fetch one category and then get all the products corresponding to the same So to do.

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.680
So let's go back to our core.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.820
Clear the new program here.

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.090
So I'm gonna call the package name as 71 here,

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:20.340
make it as me at the main function as well.

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.760
Full screen this and then the murder to do here and then paste the snippet that we have

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.700
been using so far import the appropriate packages.

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.420
I don't need the begin transaction and commit.

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.660
So let's get a category first.

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.950
Since Stephen equals tow session door get,

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:40.040
I can't go.

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.350
You don't class.

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:46.570
And then the idea is that one which corresponds toe outrageous,

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:49.000
import the category and declared,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.720
That's even now I have the C one.

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:58.330
I can bring the details of C one by typing category It caused toe stay one toe get category

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:07.440
name I can say category description is equals to Stevie Wonder could get description but

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:15.140
also say here products in this category and then I want O move through and bring the names

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:18.610
of the products for that I will use the farm group.

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:25.960
I said product be in C wonder get products which is our list that were created and mapped.

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.650
That's important part on so and then I'm gonna take your Peter,

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:39.170
get brought up me Probably along with the prize of the part Didn't get unit price before we

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:42.300
run this that also goto hibernate you till dark.

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:48.410
Get session factory change this too far so that we don't see an SQL statement because it

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:50.550
will be very complex output.

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:56.370
I'm gonna run this core right now and you can see that it should say beverages as around 12

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:57.410
different products.

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:02.720
So as you can see that this is beverages and you got their description and then these are

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.950
the different products in that particular category.

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:12.620
So the driving one category has recruited other corresponding products us.

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:19.570
But if I go to the program and then close decision after retrieving the category DIA,

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:24.680
at this point in time hibernate has brought the category corresponding to this I.

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:25.010
D.

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:28.060
I have no problem in printing these details over here,

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.340
But when I start accessing the products in that category,

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:34.990
products have not been returned yet because by default,

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:36.730
want to Money is lazy.

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:37.660
Fetch now,

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:38.850
hybrid trace toe.

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:40.060
Go back to the DB.

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:45.730
But Devi connection has been closed because connections are represented using session.

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:50.780
This is where you get an exception saying that lazy initialization exceptions.

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:53.510
So I'm gonna run this full screen console.

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:56.060
You'll see that we are able to get the beverages,

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:59.320
name and description where penetrate to access the products.

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:01.790
It is lazy initialization exception.

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:05.670
The solution to this is you go to the category,

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:06.430
Coachella,

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:09.120
and then very ill defined this one too many.

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:10.570
You can always stay here.

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:13.610
Fetch equals too eager.

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:15.350
I saved this.

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:17.540
Go back to the program around this.

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:21.780
I should not see that all the products have been true without any problem.

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:22.880
However,

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:28.740
this is not recommended as it might pollute the jbm with lots and lots of objects.
