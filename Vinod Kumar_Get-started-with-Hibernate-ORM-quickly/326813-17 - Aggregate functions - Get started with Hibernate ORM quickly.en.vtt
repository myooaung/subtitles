00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.060
like its cure have been.

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:04.390
It also supports aggregate functions.

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:05.370
For example,

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.060
if I want to get the average price of the product in each category are how many products

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:12.620
are there in each category,

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:18.450
we can use the functions like Count Min Max some on average.

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:20.250
So to the master the same.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.260
Let's Commodore Dysfunction called,

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.900
and then I'm gonna type here,

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.450
get category ways for account.

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:30.560
We don't have this function.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.050
If you press command one or control one on windows,

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.690
you get this new function.

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.560
I press tab changes to package.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:39.840
Delete the tool.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:47.750
My skill would be something like this where I want the category start category name.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:58.330
And then I like your ConEd off be from product D group by beat on every door,

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:59.730
every name,

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.090
Of course we have to die.

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.560
Pierre,

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:08.600
be dot because the moment you use an alias for the product type,

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.200
you have used the alias to access each of those members.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.650
Now the quiet is ready.

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:14.820
Once again,

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.150
we're getting in a day off a string on the number,

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.700
so we have to follow the same maker.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:28.160
We can actually copy the entire court from here based over here save this around the same,

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.640
and we should see the category ways product count listed out.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.380
So if you want,

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.450
are even additional functions.

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:36.090
For example,

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.800
if I want to say here average off Peter Unit Price,

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.560
I should be able to get that as well.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:52.360
And we can bring the same here by typing average equals toe plus data off to save it and

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:52.870
run,

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:53.680
we should know,

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.950
see the average price along with the count.
