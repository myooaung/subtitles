00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.430
so far.

00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:03.080
Whenever we're executing the quality,

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.580
we're getting the entire entity object.

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.850
But sometimes it is desirable to retrieve only a couple of columns.

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:10.810
For example,

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:13.890
if I want the product name along with its category need,

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:16.050
we can clear the quality for the same.

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:17.470
Which is God prediction.

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:19.030
Toe the monster the same.

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:25.930
Let's go and commend this out and then read the new function called Get Bardach Name with

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:27.050
category names.

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.240
Since I don't have this function,

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.850
I press command one or controlled one on Windows Toe Auto.

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.870
Generate that function press tab,

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.030
select the package level and then first ender.

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.070
Let's get it off the to do this time we're gonna created quite a bit different than

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.170
previous soirees at the string.

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.860
X Q equals toe select broader mean come on category.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.370
Don't really need from Claude it.

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.520
As you can see,

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.550
this is a property coming from directly the product,

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:02.080
Lance.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:07.020
But category name is a member off the category object,

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.270
which is a member off the product here.

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.640
Now we can see here quite equals tow session dark here,

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:19.650
quieting we have supplied its Curiel and the desired data type.

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.320
All this time we gave product as a type or category.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.000
As a type,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.160
you're so that we got a list of category are list off products.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:34.050
But this time we are getting two strings instead of an entire part of the object.

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.880
Now,

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.630
these come as an array off two elements.

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.900
So we can say here that represent object are a close.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:47.990
So now the return value of station don't create query is a quality object which gives a

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.320
list off object array element.

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.030
So I'm gonna press your command one press tender.

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.930
You see that?

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:59.040
We got a quiet e representing and object at a so,

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.000
in order to get the data will simply say it quietly.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.140
Doubt get risen list.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.810
Ascend that variable called list.

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.770
But this time in a press command one,

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:15.510
you'll see that it's a list off object already where each array will have two elements in

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.820
it.

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:19.250
One product name and the other one category name.

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:20.770
Just to prove the point.

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.950
Let's look that with they give me one object array called data from the list.

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.950
And then we're gonna print the data off zero,

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.320
which is gonna be the product.

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.930
Me plus something like this,

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.330
where data off one,

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.440
which is a category name going to be printed.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.160
I sailed this around the same.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.040
This time there is no product object created,

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.140
but we still be able to get the product names along with the category names.
