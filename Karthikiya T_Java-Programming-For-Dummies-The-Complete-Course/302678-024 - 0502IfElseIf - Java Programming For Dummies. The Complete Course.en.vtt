00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.220
All right.

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:03.190
Now let's take a look.

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:08.590
Get some of the examples off control statements and I need to open this file.

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:09.120
He felt,

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.260
if example under the project Control statements now,

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:17.490
you probably must be seeing the old program return.

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:26.390
What I would suggest is to select the entire content and do it it and right from scratch

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.470
and follow along with me.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.960
That way you will have better learning.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.230
Okay,

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:39.020
What we're going to do in this example is will demonstrate the if Els of example.

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:44.440
So what are program does is as a user,

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.850
I'm going to enter a certain number.

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:52.500
And if the number falls in within a certain range,

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.680
there is a title,

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.550
a chest title associated with it.

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.340
For example,

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:05.480
if the number falls in between 2200 and 2300 the title that we're going to display is

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:06.850
candidate Master.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.630
If it is,

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.010
the number is between 2500 and 3500.

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.950
Then we're going to display the title as Grandmaster.

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.850
So let's see how it goes.

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:27.590
First of all went to write a program to take the input from the user and for that we're

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.120
going to use these tree lines off court.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.870
Obviously,

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:34.970
at this point of time,

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:36.790
you probably don't understand this.

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:44.560
These lines off court and I suggest not to try to understand because we don't talk about

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.470
them when we talk about classes,

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.820
constructors methods,

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.080
what we're going to cover in our future chapters.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.440
But for no,

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:00.050
what these three lines of court does is when I run this program,

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:04.950
you're going to see this text being displayed on the console,

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.290
and then it will wait for the user to enter a certain integer value.

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:12.920
So let's see how it goes.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.120
But before we run this,

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.480
we there's a never to be fixed.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.380
Let's see what it is.

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.950
Let's click on this light bulb,

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:29.150
and it has shown some suggestions on how to fix it.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.450
What we're going to do is we're going to import this particular class,

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.740
obviously don't know what import means,

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.760
but we'll talk about it when we talk about packages.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.900
So let's say the program,

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.750
by pressing control s and run the program.

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.390
Of course,

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:51.470
we can run it from here.

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:52.970
Went to run from here.

00:02:52.970 --> 00:03:02.830
We were prompted with the message.

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:04.250
Enter your chest rating.

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:09.750
Now we'll enter something and we hit,

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:10.750
written or enter.

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.950
That's it.

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:21.410
So it is basically taking the input from the user and sort of storing that value in the

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:24.090
indigent into your valuable Ready.

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.310
Now we're gonna do something with this now,

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:29.690
coming to the syntax off.

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.210
If else statement.

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:34.050
This is how it iss uh,

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:40.680
if a boolean expression this expression must and should result in a bullion value,

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.250
that means that the tour falls.

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.920
And if this condition is true,

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.450
that's Galanter inside this block,

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.430
in case of this condition is force have gone.

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:51.370
It's gonna enter.

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:58.300
The control is going to enter and look after this else f statement and it will take this

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.900
condition.

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.000
If it is true,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.630
it's give the statements.

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:02.530
If it is false,

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.030
go ahead with other statements.

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:09.940
The control keeps going till the condition is met or if none of the condition is met,

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:15.000
then there is only one case with with the with the world else.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.730
The statement inside this block will get executed.

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:20.240
No,

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:21.550
let's get rid off.

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:22.640
All right,

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.940
let's get this and right.

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:25.570
Our program,

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:41.180
if rating is greater than 2200 grating is less than 2300.

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:52.780
Then we're going to display system doubt dot print Ellen Candidate Master.

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.200
In order to save your time,

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.140
I'm going to copy paste the cord,

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:03.390
which I fall that it that's expanded.

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:09.790
So what we're doing here is if the value that we that the user enters in this case it's me

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:14.200
falls in between this range 2200 way they 100.

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.670
We're gonna display the message candidate,

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:17.180
Master,

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:24.780
because this is the title given toe Chessmaster with the rating that falls in between these

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:25.980
two numbers.

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:28.130
And similarly,

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:34.460
if the number the rating falls in between 2300 and 2400 he's going to be given with the

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:35.960
title for the Master.

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:39.850
And we have International Master for this range.

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:43.800
We have Grandmaster for this range.

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.250
Um,

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:58.250
and if if the rating is less of them lesser than 2300 then we're gonna give him the title

00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:59.990
off future Grandmaster.

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:00.730
Actually,

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:03.460
there is no such title gold future Grandmaster,

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:13.650
um does that This is the minimum expected rating for any kind of title in the chess world.

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:16.930
So the rating is less than that.

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:20.580
Then we're gonna assume that he will be a grandmaster pretty soon.

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:26.060
And else if none of these conditions are met,

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:34.490
then that probably means the rating is bigger than or greater than the 3500 which is a max

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:34.950
rating,

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:36.450
which we have here.

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:37.680
In that case,

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.750
we're gonna call him a human computer.

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:42.730
So let's see how it goes.

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:43.850
That's on the program.

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:51.650
I'm going to enter the value to four for four.

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:59.220
He is an international master because the number which I have just entered falls within

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:04.200
this range and the control and turned this block and executed.

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:11.280
Now let's try to give you something like 2600 less street on the program.

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:16.470
His a grandmaster.

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:19.450
Great.

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:22.180
Let's expand the file.

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:23.620
No,

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:26.950
I have intentionally left a bug in this logic.

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:29.550
Could you find it in,

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:29.950
say,

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:31.140
a couple of minutes,

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:33.060
pause the video and try to point in the book?

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:37.400
Okay,

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:41.790
let's see what they show is that's on the program.

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:48.550
I do the reading off 2500.

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:51.300
He is certainly not a human computer.

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:53.930
He supposed to be Grandmaster.

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:56.050
What is the issue?

00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:57.500
We said it.

00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:07.120
The number falls in between 2500 and 3500 But what we didn't say is if it is equal to the

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:10.490
reading is exactly equals to these numbers.

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:11.590
What should be the rating?

00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:21.690
So what we need to do is if number is greater than or equal to 2200 then it's supposed to

00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:23.060
be candidate master.

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:25.190
If the reading Great,

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:28.280
then or equal to 2350 master,

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:29.700
etcetera.

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:35.380
I believe this supposed to be 2200 because that's the minimum reading.

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:38.290
We have that quick quick.

00:08:38.290 --> 00:08:39.080
Sorry about that.

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:40.960
We're good to go.

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:42.200
I think we're in good shape.

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:46.470
That's from the program again.

00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:53.740
And try to see if that Brooks have have bantering 2300.

00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:54.260
Would you?

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.090
US 50 Master,

00:08:56.090 --> 00:08:58.050
if I d master were good.
