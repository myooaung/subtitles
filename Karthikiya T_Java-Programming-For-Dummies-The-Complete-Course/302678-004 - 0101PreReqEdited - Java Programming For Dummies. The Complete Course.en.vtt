00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.270
before we move ahead and explored the concepts of Java that will see some off the

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:07.780
prerequisites for this course.

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:11.260
Let us take a look at skill requirements,

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:15.280
since this course is primarily meant for no voice programmer.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.190
I'm not expecting much from you,

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:18.780
but I would expect the falling.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:25.160
I would expect that you know how to install a software.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.850
Some of the examples include an anywhere software or any for editing software.

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:32.150
Like for a show.

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:37.790
If you've ever installed operating system like Windows or Mac OS X,

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.920
then you're more than qualified for this tutorial.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:49.000
I would expect that you know how to use a word processor like Microsoft War Apache,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.630
Open Office writer or Google Docks,

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:52.460
etcetera.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.200
If you know how to write emails or send Facebook post,

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.950
then you're fit to learn job.

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:02.620
Now this is the toughest of all the required.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.640
Discuss it our days,

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:05.020
Jim,

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:10.850
that you have some understanding on some of the major components off a computer like Ram

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.850
processor hard disk.

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.010
If you don't know any off these,

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.550
I would encourage you to go explore them a little bit before you plan to learn job.

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:21.210
And finally,

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.660
although not required,

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.450
having the skill off typing will be additional advantage.

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.380
Apart from skill requirements,

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.650
there are few software and hardware requirements dumbed as system requirements.

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.010
If you've been using Windows Operating system,

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.670
then these are the minimum configurations required.

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:49.140
You have to have processor off at least 2 66 Mega had just you need a disk space off 1 26

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.870
megabytes.

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:56.100
You need to have him in my own time off on 28 megabytes for Windows operating system and

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.160
the falling bro's abortion support.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.760
Java five folks three doc six or a bow.

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.070
I use him not or about,

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:04.610
and all Russians off.

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:11.200
Chrome supports execution of job And these are all various Windows operating system motions

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.650
that support running off Java program.

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.850
If you've been using Mac,

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.650
then apart from the bow mentioned hardware requirements,

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:27.940
you need to make sure you have an Inter Best Mac OS X off these abortions and sister forbid

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:28.380
Rosa,

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:34.150
you may run into problem if you have old Mac books with PowerPC.

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.000
So if you purchase your Mac after 2000 and six,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.700
then you don't have to worry,

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.390
because it was after 2000 and six,

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.830
Apple started integrating MacBooks with inter processor,

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.550
before which it was PowerPC.

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:52.810
If planets is your operating system,

00:02:52.810 --> 00:03:01.960
you need to have a mineral em off 64 MB disk space or 58 MB Mozilla browsers and all the

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.040
falling lotions off.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.650
Lennix supports execution of Java program.

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:12.350
Also note that these are all minimum configurations required to run a Java program.

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:16.560
If we want to develop and run high end job applications,

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.590
you would probably need more resources than I had just mentioned.

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.770
Now you don't have toe go check your configuration details to make sure your computer

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:25.650
supports shower.

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.840
If you're able to purchase for a tone lane or play games only,

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.670
or even if you're able to view this video on your computer,

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.100
your computer is already supporting jail your process.

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.280
But it must be in big ahead.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.950
Just your RAM must be in jeebies,

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.300
and your hard disk can even be in TV's or terabytes.

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.580
This is just for your information
