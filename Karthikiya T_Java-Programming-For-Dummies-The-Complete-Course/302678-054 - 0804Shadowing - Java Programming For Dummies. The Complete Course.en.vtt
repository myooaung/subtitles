00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.400
in this video,

00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:03.280
we're gonna talk about shadowing.

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.300
Take a look at this example.

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:10.050
We have a class and inside that we have another class which is,

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.770
and in your class,

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:17.180
we also have the main method from their execution begins.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:23.350
And all we're doing inside this method is we're calling the method inside the inner class,

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:25.450
and we're sending a perimeter.

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:27.020
Now,

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:28.150
if you take a note,

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:29.850
the name off call.

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:34.670
These variables are same one is sent as a perimeter,

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.270
which will be the local variable of this matter.

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.890
The other is theme stance,

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:41.390
variable of the inner class,

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:46.940
and the other is the instance variable off the ultra class.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:47.800
Now,

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.100
when I when I tried to run this program,

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.050
what would without put off this line?

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.080
Any guess?

00:00:54.080 --> 00:01:00.690
Javal shadow poured these variables and it will give priority to the local variables,

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.350
which is in this case,

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:03.330
it,

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:03.800
uh,

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:04.490
five.

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:10.070
If you want to access the instance very beloved in her class,

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.730
then you have to use the keyword this,

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:14.000
but the dot operate.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.190
This will refer to the current object which in this case,

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:19.610
is in her class object.

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:29.910
So this statement will display one if you wanted to access the instance variable off the

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:30.810
outer class.

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:40.230
Then you're gonna do this way the name of the ultra class and is a keyboard this dot the

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.950
vegetable name.

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.890
Let's try to run the program,

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.360
Diego.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.880
The result is as expected.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.460
You know,

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.350
next week we're going to take a look at local classes.

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.750
Stay tuned.
