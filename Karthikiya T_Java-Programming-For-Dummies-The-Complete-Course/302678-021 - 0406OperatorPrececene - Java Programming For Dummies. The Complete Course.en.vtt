00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.430
in this video,

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:05.450
we're going to talk about operator presidents.

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:08.760
This can be better explained with renovations.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:09.970
So let's go there.

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:11.160
All right,

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.320
let's say,

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.620
you know,

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:13.710
Java program.

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.760
We have the following equation.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.660
10 multiplied Best six minus three.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.060
Now if we're on the program,

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.820
what the output be?

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:29.550
10 multiplied by six 60 and ministry would be 57.

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:36.150
Or would it be 10 multiplied by six minus three,

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.050
which would be three?

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.170
Which gives us the result off 30.

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:42.850
Which one is correct?

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.670
This is ambiguous.

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.890
We don't know how to value this.

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.160
So to solve this problem,

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.060
Java developers introduced this president's table.

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:59.670
The president's table tells which operator will have the higher presidents and which

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.480
operator will have the least.

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:02.210
Presidents,

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.940
the operator that is listed on top,

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.150
will have the highest presidents,

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:12.720
and the operator that is listed at the bottom of the table will have the least presidents.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.650
So the president's increases as we go up and wise worsen.

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:19.290
So no coming back to the sea.

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:19.990
Question.

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:25.460
Let's see how we can solve this ambiguity if you take a look at this table.

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:32.290
The multiplication operator has the higher presidents compared to subtraction operator.

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.080
So this part off equation will be evaluated first,

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.390
and the result will be computed with this,

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.750
so the result would be 57.

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:40.840
However,

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.870
if you want this piece off equation to be calculated first,

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:48.750
then you to enclose it within a parent is this.

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.680
Now the result would be 30.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:58.550
Let's take a look at another example six divided by two minus one.

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.720
So what is the result off this equation?

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.150
Balls that we do and find out.

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.660
Okay,

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:10.560
now let's all the ambiguity we have.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.140
Division operator and subtraction division has the higher presidents compared to

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.040
suppression Operator.

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.790
So this part off equation will be evaluated first,

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.190
and then the result will be computed with this.

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:29.270
So the result would be to sometimes in an equation,

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.630
we may have operators with equal presidents.

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.860
Let's take a look at the sea question.

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.680
Now,

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.360
both less and minus operators here have equal residents.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:49.070
That's where this rule off associate duty come into picture first and minus the rule off

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.850
associate duty.

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.320
Say's went to go from left to right,

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:59.180
so will first saw the left hand side equation and then the result will be computed with

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.810
this seven bless.

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.560
Five would be 12.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.020
Now,

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.090
let's take a look at another equation.

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.880
So I wanted to go from left to right.

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.520
So this will be evaluated.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.470
First result will be evaluated with this.

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.850
And the result off this interrogation will be evaluated with this.

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:23.200
So we're going from left to right,

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.270
best on the rule off associate duty.

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:30.650
Similarly,

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.420
we have associated the rules for other operators as well.

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.050
Take a look at the sea question.

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:46.530
So the result off this would be minus one.

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.150
We're going from left direct.

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.060
Both the operators are same,

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.600
meaning that they both have the equal presidents and Asper,

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:55.930
the rule off its versatility,

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.350
went to go from left direct.

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:01.790
Now let's try to put things together.

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.380
Take a look at this equation.

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:12.710
Find out the result off this equation where X equals fight 10 minus four,

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:17.160
divided by predicament off X minus five.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.520
Positive.

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:21.120
We do and sold solely.

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.750
Question.

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.250
Okay,

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.880
so in this equation we have four operators.

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.470
Our foot,

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:32.650
the predicament operator,

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.390
has the highest presidents,

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:37.080
so this will be evaluated first.

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.860
So 10 minus four,

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.850
divided by the predicament off five would become four,

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:50.150
minus five and now out of these three operators which are left,

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:53.890
the division operator has the highest presidents.

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:59.850
So this piece off equation would be solved 10 minus one minus five.

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:04.480
Not since but these operators has the equal presidents.

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:07.650
I wanted to go with associative the rule.

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:12.210
What says we need to go from left to right and then we solve it?

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:14.690
The result would be four.

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:21.050
We saw this first and then computer the result of this.

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:25.050
Now go back to our I D and run the program.

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:26.720
You would see the same results.
