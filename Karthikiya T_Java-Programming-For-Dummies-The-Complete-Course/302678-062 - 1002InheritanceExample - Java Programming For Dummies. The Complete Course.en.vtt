00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.480
Now let's go through some of the examples before that.

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.150
Let me just show you how to import this project into your clips and Roma.

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:09.720
Click on file.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.550
Click on Import.

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.950
I chose this option.

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.320
Existing projects into workspace.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.580
Click next chills This radio button,

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.460
which is select Rock I file Click Browse,

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.350
chose the ZIP file that I have one build along with this chapter.

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:34.990
Click open and click Finish that should import this project into Iraq.

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:38.620
Spits Once you do so open up these files.

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:45.650
We have a class called Living Being Animal and Dark.

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:49.980
What I'm talking about here is multilevel inheritance.

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.780
We have three glasses,

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.530
dark classes,

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.330
extending animal class and middle classes,

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.880
extending the living being.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:59.500
Plus,

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.790
if we create an object off class dog,

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:09.490
then it will inherit properties off port living being as well as the animal.

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.910
That's exactly what I'm demonstrating here.

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.230
We have a dog object here,

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:21.250
and I'm able to call all the methods from thes three clubs.

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.250
Since we talked about multilevel inheritance,

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.870
they should also suffice for single inheritance.

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:31.370
Now let's talk about high radical in her tints.

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:34.010
For that I have another class,

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:35.850
which is Capt.

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.350
More this classes,

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.670
dog and cat will belong to animal category,

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.360
and hence the stool attained the properties and behavior.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:53.350
Often animal doctors extends animal cat class extent animal.

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.350
If I create an object off cat,

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.360
then as you can expect,

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:09.620
it can axis the behavior or the methods from its parent and grandparents nets from this

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:10.280
program,

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:20.620
you can just run it right away from here They go.

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:21.450
If you're interested,

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.750
I can just go through all the out booked.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:29.650
What I'm doing is I'm just printing these strings.

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.650
I hope that's pretty clear.

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.250
And when we talk about interfaces,

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.010
well,

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.510
core the problems we have.

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.920
But the multiple and hybrid inheritance and guests.

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:47.280
If we use classes to extend their behaviors for now,

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.350
they should suffice.

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.550
See you in my next video.
