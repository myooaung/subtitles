00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.260
So far we have used had been Saidi to run out our programs,

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:07.160
but now it's time to move on.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:08.090
Toe eclipse.

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:08.570
I d.

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:09.520
No,

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.330
I remember I told you that we won't go through all these features in here,

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:20.060
but I felt it's better that I talk about all these features in the Eclipse idea itself to

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:21.870
not to create any confusion.

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:30.380
Eclipse is the most popular integrated development and Roman used in this after industry to

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.180
help build the jar projects.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:37.270
Eclipse is also an open tour supported by thousands off contributors,

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:43.660
and it definitely makes a perfect choice for developing Java applications as well as the

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.150
android applications.

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.150
So why should we wait?

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.300
Let's go ahead and download them,

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:49.850
install it,

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.430
go to eclipse,

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:55.450
start argh and then click on download.

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:01.320
We have multiple Russians off eclipse.

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.990
By the time of this recording,

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:07.150
Eclipse Neon is the latest one.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:08.880
So let's don't Lord it.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:15.550
My PC is extraordinary it and thats why im downloading 64 bit abortion off eclipse.

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:17.020
Let's click.

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.760
Download,

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.570
download started.

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:22.470
Okay,

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:36.790
I have the downloaded that's install it run as administrator by the where have moved my

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:45.110
operating system to Windows 10 The reason why I mentioned Windows seven earlier is because

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.600
by the time of this recording,

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.550
Window seven is the most popular operating system.

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:55.440
And hence I've told you how to configure your job for enrollment on Windows seven operating

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:56.010
system.

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.800
It's exact same steps which need to follow.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:59.880
Even in Windows 10.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.890
That's more Click.

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:03.360
Yes,

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:18.490
we have a glimpse idea for Java developers and an idea for Java Enterprise Edition

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:19.530
developers.

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.630
We also have it lists for C and C plus plus so on and so forth.

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:29.290
But what we want is either off this Since we're in our future videos,

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.140
we're going to get into Java two Enterprise Edition.

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.780
Let's install that click on install.

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.050
Accept the license,

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:42.350
of course.

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:52.510
Accept the license again.

00:02:52.510 --> 00:03:05.550
It's going to take quite a while.

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:08.650
Click Launch.

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:24.050
You can do any directory that you wish I'm going to do.

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:30.250
New eclipse work directory under you drive.

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.390
So this will be the place where all your projects would be reciting.

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:50.390
Look OK if you're interested,

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:53.210
you can go through these tutorials samples,

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.840
etcetera,

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.670
but I would just like to skip.

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.400
So here's the eclipse.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:05.230
The most popular I D for developing job perhaps let's try to create a project.

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:06.250
Click New,

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.750
and what we're looking for is Javal Project.

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:16.600
We have many different types of projects that we can create,

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:22.010
but most of these are at the moment or not off any use,

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:23.760
said Joe.

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.370
A project like Next,

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:35.650
do the Project their name First project.

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.040
If you want,

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:42.340
you can play around with these options and that's fish.

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:47.650
This will create a new project.

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:50.460
Please remember my decision and click.

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.960
Yes,

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:55.730
here we have our project now,

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:56.850
right click on it.

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:00.470
Click on New Class.

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:06.450
Give it a name.

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:12.050
First Java program.

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:17.330
Now the beauty off Eclipse ideas that you can play around with this options.

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.270
If you want main method to be present,

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:22.300
then I just have to check this check box.

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.540
Similarly,

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:26.860
if you want to have constructors from Super Class,

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:29.120
obviously don't know the term super glasses off.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.910
Now you'll get to know about it when we talk about inheritance,

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:33.450
etcetera.

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:39.680
But just take a look at this and have a glimpse off what it is doing.

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:43.540
Let's click finish.

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:47.850
So here we have our first program.

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:54.050
Now here's the little surprise to you Hair clips idea is actually a lot easier than that

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:54.940
being tidy.

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:56.670
As you can see,

00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:00.150
we have a menu item that is similar to award document.

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:04.240
If you click anyone off them slept the source.

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:07.300
And by just looking at these words,

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:09.910
you would be able to figure out what it what it does.

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:11.880
For example,

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:13.800
it can generate Get us insiders,

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.170
ex cetera.

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:16.500
Obviously,

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:18.020
we're going to be using majority off.

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:19.670
This functionality is pretty soon.

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:21.350
Stay tuned.
