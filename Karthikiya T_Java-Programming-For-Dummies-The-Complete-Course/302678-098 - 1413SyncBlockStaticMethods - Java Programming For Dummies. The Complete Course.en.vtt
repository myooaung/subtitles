00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.290
in case if you want it to acts of the static method,

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:07.220
like in this case,

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:09.650
we have a right to file out static method.

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.650
Then you might want to acquire lock on the class,

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:14.810
not Dane stance.

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:18.590
So how do we acquired lock in a synchronised block?

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.250
Instead of passing in the object,

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:30.950
we'll pass in the class name that's copied and pasted or here dark class.

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:45.480
Now you can access the static methods using the class name like so hope that makes sense,

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.350
Say you in my next video.
