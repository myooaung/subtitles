00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.110
Okay,

00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:03.270
let's talk about our first our program.

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.850
Let me just insert a statement in here,

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.580
which is a simple system.

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:09.790
Doubt our doctrine teller.

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:11.960
Let's expand this by double litany.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.670
So far,

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:14.120
we haven't.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.210
You talked about our first.

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:15.970
You have a program.

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:18.540
If you take a look at how the tutorials,

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:22.440
they'll start right off with their first our program and try to explain you everything.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.340
But now I bet by just looking at this program,

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.550
you would be able to figure out what's happening.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:29.940
For example,

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:31.750
we know what public is doing here,

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.330
and we know what static is doing here.

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:39.050
And we also know why main method has to be a static method.

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.860
We know this is a written type.

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.010
We're not returning anything from the main method,

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.890
hence its wide.

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:53.170
We also know what the statement does as we talked about it earlier.

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:58.500
The only thing that strange to you is this.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.960
You can easily guess that we're sending his string.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.430
Airy has an argument to this method main,

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.980
But how do we ever send an argument to a main method?

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:16.550
Let me introduce to you command line arguments before we take a look at how we send

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:18.250
arguments to the main method.

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:19.750
The stringer.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:26.030
A Let's let's have a couple of instructions that will look through all the elements off the

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.150
string Garay and just print them.

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.200
Now let's see how we can send arguments,

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:37.160
Click on run run configuration,

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.450
choose the program,

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:51.090
click on arguments and send couple off arguments here like so and click on that play.

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.590
I had already done that.

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:55.320
Click,

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.630
run.

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.660
Say we have those arguments printed.

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:04.880
This all looks complex,

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:10.200
but essentially what we're doing is remember our first hour program before even installing

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.540
the Net Bin Saidi.

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.050
We had run our programs through command line,

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.870
and when we do so,

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.400
we use the command that looks something like this.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:27.860
Would it Java and then program name?

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.980
This is how we run.

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.780
Our job programs took command line,

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.370
but in addition to this,

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.090
we just send some more some arguments,

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.970
some random text with this,

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.600
with the space as a separator.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:52.410
Whatever you enter here as an argument separated by a white space would be sent as an

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:53.750
argument to the main method.

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.280
And that's nothing but command line argument.

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:03.450
The clips we're doing this is by going to run configuration,

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.180
and then arguments provide your arguments.

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.550
Now I know this all process looks really complex.

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.290
You're probably annoyed at the moment,

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.380
looking at all these tabs,

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:17.080
etcetera.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.740
Trust me.

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:21.430
In just a few chapters,

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.480
you feel absolutely comfortable with the clips I D.

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.750
It's pretty easy to use and is meant to make your life easy.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.440
It's close.

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.350
See you in my next video.
