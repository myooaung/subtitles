00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.050
in this lesson,

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:04.810
we will talk about conditional operators.

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:12.580
We have conditional end and conditional or operators conditional operators defines under

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.220
what conditions should an equation result in a bullion value?

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.740
True,

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.770
let me explain you what I mean.

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:20.950
Unlike other operators,

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:25.140
conditional operators will take bullying expressions on board the sites.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.080
For example,

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.210
this expression would result in a Boolean value.

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.850
It could ever be true or false.

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.200
Same is the case with this equation.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.720
Now for conditional end,

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:44.510
the only case where the result off this entire equation would be true is when these two

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.400
equations result and bullion value.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:47.830
True.

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:52.950
Otherwise this equation would result in faults.

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:56.070
So in this guess a equals 20.

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.250
It's true,

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.310
his be greater than a It's true.

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:05.500
So it's true and true which would result in value.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.140
True In this case,

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.390
we have true and forts and ultimately will get false as a result,

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:19.370
off the center in question and false True is also false,

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:20.130
false,

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.660
false.

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:26.810
They're also faults so only under one condition this equation will be true in case off

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:27.860
conditional end.

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:34.200
That is when both the questions result and building value true when it comes to conditional

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.380
our operator.

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.730
If Ader off these stubble in equations result in value true,

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:43.050
then the entire three question would be true.

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.690
So true True would be true.

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.150
True falls would be true.

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.750
False truth would be true.

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.820
False walls will be force.

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.280
We'll sit out,

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.410
put in a moment and then we have Turner,

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:01.190
the operator.

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.080
Unlike any other operator,

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.870
turn every operator takes in three operates.

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:06.950
For example.

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:13.780
This is actually a shorthand off using If Els cloths will talk about if else statement when

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.590
we talk about control flow,

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.340
OK,

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.880
basically,

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:25.270
what this equation is doing is we have an equation which would result in either true or

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.890
false.

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.090
If it is true,

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.480
then this statement would be executed.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.870
In this case,

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.540
we're just simply ascending the value a or if it is false,

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.350
then this would not enter this section off the statement.

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:41.220
Instead,

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.450
it word print that's value be so essentially,

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.930
what we're doing here is we're trying to find the minimum value between these two are

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.780
prints off these two variables.

00:02:53.780 --> 00:03:00.730
If yea is less than B would say smaller and we're gonna print the value A because that's

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:01.750
what we're standing here.

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.550
If he is less than B.

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:08.700
Then we're gonna send the value off here toe this variable minimal.

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.030
If he is not less than be,

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.220
then obviously we would be the minimum value.

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.790
And we're ascending the value be two men value.

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.500
That's what we're printing here.

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.310
That's on the program.

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:22.350
And she'd output.

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:29.930
All right,

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:31.050
What do we have here?

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.190
Conditional end,

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:34.690
too.

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:35.750
Too true.

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.950
And in any other case,

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.820
it would be false.

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:46.160
And for conditional or the only time we would see parties when both the conditions are

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.410
board,

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.850
the bullying expressions result in forts and turn every value.

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:56.650
So the minimum value between A and B using the turn every operator hiss 20 which is the

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:57.680
value off year,

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:58.750
all right.
