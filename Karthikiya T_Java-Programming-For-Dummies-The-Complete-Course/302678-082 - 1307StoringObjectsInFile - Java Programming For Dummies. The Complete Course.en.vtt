00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.610
it is possible that the store an object along with its state into a file and then again

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:07.710
from another program,

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.050
we can get that object back again along with its state from that file.

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:12.650
Well,

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:14.300
this might sound confusing,

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:15.690
but it is possible.

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.650
And for that purpose we're gonna have to use a mechanism called civilization.

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:22.160
What a civilization.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:29.670
A civilization is a mechanism where an object can be converted into a byte stream and in

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.940
order to be able to convert an object into a byte stream,

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.700
are two BC realizable.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:40.140
The class has to implement the sea realizable interface.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.280
Only then the objects off this class will qualify to BC.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.400
Realizable in this class is very simple class where we have one constructor and we're

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.410
setting the state.

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:57.500
How one off these variables in here by sending an argument to this constructor.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.980
In this case,

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:58.660
it's color,

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:03.450
and we're going to use this method to get what we have set in here.

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:10.350
We also have a method and that just simply going to show this message barking.

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:16.740
What I did in this file is I have created an object off the class,

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.070
and I had said the state to brown the color off the dog is going to be Braun.

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.580
And the next thing that I'm going to do is going to create a file output stream.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:34.340
We can use Pilot put stream to put all the banner idiot all the object into a text while

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.250
and in order to can work the object into the binary data,

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:45.540
we're gonna have to use this class object output stream and its constructor will taken this

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.250
object,

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.480
the object off file output stream,

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.090
and using this object,

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.410
we will call this Met the right object.

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:58.030
And we're going to send the object that we want to see real ice as an argument to this

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.160
method doing so the object,

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.040
along with its state,

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.450
will be converted into,

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.510
ah,

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.910
a bundle reform and will be stored inside this text file.

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:08.890
And finally,

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:14.460
we're gonna close the stream by the way in or examples we were not using the try catch

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:20.950
block The example that I have demonstrated use definitely not a good practice.

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.690
You're gonna have to use the try.

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.710
Catch block is just that the number off lines are code will increase your point of juice,

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:32.280
try catch blocks let me show you how the class looks with try catch blocks.

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.920
Here it is.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:40.230
This has increased the lines off court almost doubled anyway,

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.180
Let's run this program and we should have this file created.

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.120
So here it is.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.580
Let's see what's inside it.

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:54.010
You would not understand anything or basically the texted it to Windows.

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.500
Text editor tried to convert all those Binah radiating two characters,

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.250
and this is how it ended up.

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:04.200
But what you're seeing is essentially the dog object in a textual form.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.580
It isn't that wonderful.

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.140
Now let's go back.

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.750
I have another program which is object input stream.

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.300
And as you would guess,

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:19.910
we're gonna create an object input stream to read the object banner data back into the

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:20.610
program,

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:25.450
and then we can use their object along with the state.

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:26.690
So in here,

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.560
that's exactly what I did.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:29.680
Using filing put screen,

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:35.670
I'm reading the data from the file and then I'm sending this as a perimeter to the

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.850
constructor off object input stream.

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:39.730
And using this object,

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:45.030
I'm going to just call the method inside which is read object and I need to type cast it

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.270
back to the desired object this is dog object.

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:55.770
So here's the class name and now we can call the method inside it as well as we can also

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:01.850
get the state that we had set when we civilized the object.

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:09.580
So what we have done here is we have DC realized that object and were able to play with

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:10.310
that object.

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:11.550
Let me run this program.

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:13.940
Awesome.

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:15.370
Isn't that wonderful?

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:20.920
The concept off civilization and destabilization will come into picture when we talk about

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.410
Gelato Enterprise Edition,

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.380
where you would deal with the applications,

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.940
etcetera.

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.690
But it's a long way ahead.

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:33.050
I'm just trying to tell you the significance off using the streams for dealing with objects

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.050
.

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:34.630
Hope that makes sense.

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:36.750
See you in my next video.
