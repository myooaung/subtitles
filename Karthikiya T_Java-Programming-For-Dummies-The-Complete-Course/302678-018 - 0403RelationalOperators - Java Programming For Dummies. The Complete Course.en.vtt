00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.670
in this chapter,

00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:07.750
we will talk about relational operators and equality operator.

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:19.700
Relational Operator compares to a print and would give a Belene result we have greater than

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:27.560
operator that will check if operated on the left is greater than the operator and on the

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:28.000
right.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.220
Similarly,

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.950
we have greater than or equals two operator.

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:39.730
It will check if a variable or in operating on the left is greater than or equal do an

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:40.950
operation on the right.

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.600
Similarly,

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:50.400
we have less than operator and less than or equals two operator and finally,

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.950
in relational operators,

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:59.840
we have not be closed to operator to check to see if operating on the left is not equal to

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:00.950
operate on the right.

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:10.930
And we have equality Operator that will check if operate on the left is equals to operate

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:11.650
on the right.

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:13.360
No,

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:20.300
that dis operator has to continue to equal sign because if we just give single equal saying

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.090
like this,

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.650
then according to Java,

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.000
this is a signing operator,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.250
just as we did here.

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:36.640
If you want to compare to our prince and check the equality than here to give you to

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:37.190
contribute,

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:44.930
recall saying and one thing to note here is all the relational operators will consider only

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.950
numerical data types like integer float character.

00:01:49.950 --> 00:02:05.140
Let's run the program all right.

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.470
Is he a greater than be faults?

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.210
A Is greater than or equals to be,

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:13.900
holds Ellis.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.170
Then be true.

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:23.720
Palestina Request to be true and not equals to be true is a quotes.

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.750
Be quotes.

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.160
All right now you can go and experiment with this program by yourself.
