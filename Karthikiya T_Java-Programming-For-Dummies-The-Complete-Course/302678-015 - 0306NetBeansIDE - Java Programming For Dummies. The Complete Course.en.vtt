00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
If all you want to do in your life is $2 simple hello world applications,

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.280
then you should be happy with the North bad.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.350
It can use note pad to write your job programs,

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:12.180
but in all likelihood,

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:17.020
you want to go beyond a hello world application and actually write some meaningful job

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.050
programs are create applications.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:20.890
Well,

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:21.680
in that case,

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:28.360
you have to get it off a note pad and actually install I d are integrated development and

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:28.830
Roman.

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.910
The name might sound a bit too technical,

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.850
especially if you're a newbie to using i D.

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:40.450
But you can think off it as an enhanced version off note pad with a lot of features.

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:45.210
I d will give you a lot off convenience while you're writing code,

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.170
for example,

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.380
it will give you auto suggestions so that it will save some development time.

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:55.940
Are you sure the Comparator matters right when you're typing the cord and you don't have to

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.950
manually compile the court yourself,

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:03.830
So stuff like this will definitely give you a lot of convenience or writing your job

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:04.650
programs.

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.770
So the next thing we want to do is to install and I d.

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.890
Now there are lot off ideas available in the market.

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.320
Some of them are paid.

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.100
Some of them are open source.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.150
For example.

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:18.450
We have eclipse.

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.720
We have net beans.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.230
We have intelligent,

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.650
which is one of the popular ID's etcetera.

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:31.050
But the one that I'm going to install right now is going to be net beans.

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.760
Well,

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.050
one of the popular idea is used in industry is eclipse,

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:43.540
but I'm not going to install it right now because the user interface off eclipse is not so

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.450
user friendly for beginners.

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.820
So we're going to stick on with something that sort of sits between a note pad and eclipse

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.570
and that I d is net beans,

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.150
which is also an open source.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:58.970
You don't have to pay a single dollar.

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.050
You can download it and use it.

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.710
So let's take a look at how we can install that beans.

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:13.950
I d let me go to the browser and type in that bean start arc.

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.110
So here is the home page off net beans,

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.200
and here it is.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:26.630
You can quickly and easily dull of death stop mobile and Web applications with Java

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.160
JavaScript html five,

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.350
etcetera.

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.750
What we're interested in right now is just java.

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.810
Click on download.

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:40.810
Once you're in this page,

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.690
go ahead and click Download.

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.960
If you're interested in older releases,

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.150
then can check this out.

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:50.900
Otherwise just don't Lord,

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.450
this that would take you to this page.

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:55.260
Hey,

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.250
reckon a the download The source are the binaries.

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.150
Since Net Beans is an open source software,

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.950
you can actually get access to its source code.

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.410
But let's just download the binaries.

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.350
We're not going to do anything with the source code.

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:21.890
So click this link That would take us to yet another page click this link here that would

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:23.950
actually download the net beans.

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.820
I've already done that.

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.280
And so I have it in here.

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.790
Use a software like WinZip.

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:33.990
In my case,

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:35.680
I'm using seven zip software,

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.970
no extract all the files and once extracted the zip file.

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.170
I got this folder.

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.060
Just open it.

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:52.150
Go to BIN Folder and DoubleClick had been $64 e x e.

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.050
If your operating system is a 64 bit operating system,

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:59.650
otherwise you want to open up the other one.

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.110
In my case,

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.680
I have window 64 and I'm going to double click it.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:16.330
I want to run this application.

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:17.830
You actually get this prompt.

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:19.950
I guess this will come only for the first time.

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:24.050
Just agree with it and then you'll see an I.

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.600
D.

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.150
That looks something like this.

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:34.740
If you get any additional problems while installing two stacks up all those prompt and

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.310
finally installed that beans.

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:42.920
One of the prerequisites off using net beans is that you have installed Jerry K in one off

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:44.150
or previous lectures.

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:48.450
We have seen how to install dedicate and I hope you have done that.

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:51.200
So without any afford the delay,

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.230
let's run off forced our program for this.

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:56.050
We're going to create a new project.

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.350
You will be used to all these terminologies.

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:04.150
You can think off project as kind of like a folder that holds multiple files.

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:05.330
Not exactly,

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:10.290
but close enough while we progress through this course will understand what is a project.

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:15.950
It would basically comprise off all the files that your application might comprise off.

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:17.330
For example,

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:18.850
you could have Dow files,

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:20.360
he could have image files.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.970
You could have XML files etcetera.

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:26.650
Once you click on the new project would get this prompt.

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:33.600
You can either go with maven griddle are and maven and Gretel are a little bit advanced.

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.300
Just go with Java with,

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:40.050
and this is the simplest form off job application.

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:45.270
Choose a job application under projects and click next.

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:47.670
Give your project the name.

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:53.040
I want to call it a sample projects and hit finish.

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:58.350
It's going to take a while,

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:05.850
so this has created the project,

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:10.540
along with a Java file where we can start writing the source court.

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:12.180
I'm just simply going to say hello,

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:14.320
world or whatever has part off.

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:15.590
This is our statement,

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:23.060
and as soon as the president dot you would see some suggestions coming.

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:24.210
That's the beauty off I.

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:24.650
D.

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:32.410
How dot print Ellen,

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:39.450
and you can say whatever you want in here.

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:43.850
Let me also increase the form size just a bit,

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:46.560
not quite sure how to do that.

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.420
So before I waste your time,

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:49.810
let me pause the video,

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:52.350
increase the phone size and then get back.

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:54.930
Okay,

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:55.940
it's quite easy.

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:57.790
You gotta tools,

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:01.880
options and select wants and colors,

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:05.050
and it can change this size in here.

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:08.130
I hope you're able to see the text.

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:08.460
Now.

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:11.450
Let's run our program.

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:17.860
It's going to take a while,

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:26.380
so this has displayed our message,

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:30.360
which is great in case if inaudible to see this message,

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:35.470
then your net Bin Saidi haven't the government is the Jerrick Installation directory,

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:43.490
in which case just open up the neck beans folder and go toe GTC.

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:46.270
Open up the net beans Khan filed.

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:51.050
I went to use the note pad plus plus software to open this file.

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:54.250
So here it is.

00:07:54.250 --> 00:08:04.050
Go to the extreme bottom of the file and you would see this field that beans Jessica home

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:05.780
just uncommon.

00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:09.510
This by removing this and here,

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:13.440
he would specify the part to the Jerrick installation directory,

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:18.920
and you should be good to go if your face and issues do,

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:19.580
let me know,

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:21.250
and I'll be happy to assist.
