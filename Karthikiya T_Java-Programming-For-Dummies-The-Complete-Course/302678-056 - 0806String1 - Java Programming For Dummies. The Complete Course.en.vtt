00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.960
in this video,

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:09.150
we're gonna talk about string data type string in Java is nothing but a collection off

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.410
characters just as award in English language,

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:14.950
which is collection off letters.

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.250
This is how we represent a string in Java.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:20.320
Now,

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.380
by taking a look at the state man,

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.750
you may think that string is a primitive their time,

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:28.800
but actually it isn't.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.050
String is a known criminal data type or user to find at a time.

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:42.120
So essentially string is a class and were in fact creating an object off this class to be

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.300
able to create the string.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:45.470
Well,

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.850
we're not explicitly creating an object using the new keyword,

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.520
but Java does that.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:52.150
Paris.

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:59.460
So this statement in here can be presented in this manner as well.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.590
We have a character,

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:02.050
ARY,

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:09.450
which has all these characters ap ple and we're sending that character area as an argument

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.300
to the constructor off string class.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:21.720
These two statements in here does exactly what the single statement does for the

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.870
convenience of the programmer and to save time in the Fort Java designers gave a shorter

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.580
ray off representing this tool statements.

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.750
So let me come in them out,

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.910
said the pile.

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:40.750
If I try to run this program,

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.350
then we would see Apple has output.

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.250
Let's do that.

00:01:48.250 --> 00:02:00.620
Let's come in this line and tried to run the program by un commenting these two lines would

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:01.680
see the same output.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.250
Great.

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:10.780
So why job or designers decided to have string as and non permitted at that time?

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.260
That's because it uses lots of flexibility.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:20.390
There are lots of methods in this class string that we can utilize for our own comedians.

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:21.930
For example,

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.550
let me just uncommitted all these lines off court.

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:30.070
Save the fine.

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.150
Now,

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.120
by calling a method inside that string class called Lane,

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.850
we can get the length off that string,

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.520
whatever the string is.

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.530
Similarly,

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:48.670
we can convert that string toe upper case by calling this method called to upper case.

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.250
We can replace a character.

00:02:51.250 --> 00:03:00.850
We can find the position off a certain character We can also extract This sub string off

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:01.950
has string,

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.590
for example,

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.730
in the string apple.

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.020
We might want to get a sub string like ple or something like that.

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.880
Let's see how this program works.

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.220
That's from the program here.

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:24.370
It iss were able to utilize that string class and performs that in operations on the string

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.370
.

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:31.350
There are many such methods in string class for more information on them.

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.750
You can defer to this link.

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.550
Actually,

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.420
don't have to go inside this link.

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:39.050
If it just,

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:43.130
here's the daughter operator you were.

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.800
I d.

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:44.950
Evils adjust.

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.300
What are the methods available that are off public?

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:56.730
And we also have explanation off each and every method so you can just go through it.

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.950
It's pretty much self explanatory.

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:04.450
That's undue and save the file.

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.280
In our next week,

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.150
we're gonna talk about string as immutable.
