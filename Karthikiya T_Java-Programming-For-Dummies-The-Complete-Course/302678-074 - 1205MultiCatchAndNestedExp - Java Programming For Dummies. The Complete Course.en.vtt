00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.410
earlier,

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:03.900
we had talked about the custom exceptions,

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:07.380
but there seemed to be no real advantage with it.

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:08.380
For example,

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:10.060
instead of saying custom exception,

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:17.050
I can always say exception and have it in here as well.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.200
If you run the program,

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.850
you would still get the exception.

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.070
But the exception in here the name of the exception is not really descriptive.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.480
But whereas we have our own name and when we get an exception,

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.550
the name is somewhat descriptive for the user.

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.200
And here,

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.850
instruct saying custom exception.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:54.470
I could say illegal age exception in here as well,

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.770
and we put this in here as well,

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:06.650
said that man on the program.

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.780
Illegal age exception.

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:09.990
No,

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.820
this makes sense.

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.050
However,

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:13.570
it is always advisable,

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.230
and actually it makes more sense.

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.800
Toe.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:21.150
Have your own matters written in here that will that will be useful for the programmer,

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.490
for example.

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:23.480
Instead,

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.350
off letting the programmer give his own age.

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.710
Maybe we want to define the age somewhere in here,

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:48.890
so public static age limit the return type is going to be in no,

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:49.250
instead,

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.220
off letting the user enter the age.

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:01.510
We can tell him what is the legal age and you can use the same class name,

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:07.620
since there's a static something of that sort.

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:08.250
Now,

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.190
this is not the best example I could give,

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:15.640
but I'm just trying to give you an idea of how you can make the most out of custom

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:16.460
exceptions.

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:20.840
Let's have the file and run the program the heart,

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:21.160
but is,

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.970
as expected,

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:22.890
okay,

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:23.700
moving on.

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.710
Earlier,

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:31.940
we had talked about having multiple exceptions under the same catch block.

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.870
This is good only when you're trying to when you're trying to perform a certain set off

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:37.500
actions,

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.820
no matter what exception we get.

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:44.520
But we haven't talked about Air Index autobahn exception.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.750
It just means that I'm trying to access an element that is not present.

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:49.500
And you,

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:50.260
let's say,

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:55.090
Let's say we have six elements in here and I'm trying to access the tent element There is

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:01.180
going to result in error Index are about exception now going back Instead of having these

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.980
under one catch block,

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.150
you can always have them in a couple of catch blocks,

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:18.370
each dealing with individual exception like so now that being said at that time,

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.750
only one cash block will get executed.

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:21.620
For example,

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.200
if we get another point exception,

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.700
the controller is going to get inside this block.

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:26.550
Similarly,

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.770
if we have Hair index sort of bone exception,

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:31.090
the controller will get inside this block.

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:36.370
But what if there is an exception that is neither of these?

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.210
Then it's always better to have a more generalized exception.

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.700
Make,

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:41.440
for example,

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.750
could have simply exception.

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:52.210
Always do remember that the order has to be more specific exception to a more general

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.800
exception.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.050
If you put this catch block on top off everything,

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:01.560
there's a There's a problem with this undateable cash block for not born.

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:02.130
To exception,

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.710
it has already handled by the catch block for exception.

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:10.130
That means even if you get no pointer or Air Index autobahn exception,

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:14.740
the controller will get inside this block because exception is more general.

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:20.080
And these two exceptions are actually the child classes off the exception class.

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:23.650
So we need to have a proper order.

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:28.250
You can also have a try catch block inside another tribe block.

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:30.210
It's called Nestor Exception.

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.550
Let me just show you what I mean.

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.080
For example,

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:40.820
that's ever get it off the handling off Null Pointer exception from here and would like to

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:46.050
handle right where the actual statement is gonna say,

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:47.190
Try,

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:59.350
catch and then we can have the statement in here and this is perfectly fine.

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:01.130
We got a try.

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.500
Catch inside another try catch block.

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:09.560
Also so far in our examples who have talked about the null point exception.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.280
But remember,

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.350
prevention is always better than cure.

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:16.750
It's always better to prevent inal point exception,

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:21.150
then trying to handle it once it comes.

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:25.890
What I mean by that is every time you went to spare another point exception,

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:32.870
it's always better to have an if condition and check to see if their object is now or not.

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:43.170
Only if this object is not know will you want execute this statement now this makes sense.

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:45.430
So you in my next video
