00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.005
Let us try to understand where Java is used.

00:00:04.005 --> 00:00:08.700
I think it's easier to answer where Java is not used because there are

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.620
so many things you can do with java that we simply cannot list everything in here,

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.470
but I'll try to list a few of them.

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.020
Java is the most popular option for creating Enterprise web applications.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.375
If you're wondering what is a web application,

00:00:24.375 --> 00:00:26.010
assuming that you are a beginner,

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.925
then a web application is something that runs on the browser

00:00:29.925 --> 00:00:34.500
and can be accessed by multiple users across the globe, over the Internet.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.970
Some of the examples are like flight booking system or a banking application,

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.670
or maybe an e-commerce website, et cetera.

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.580
They all fall under the category of web applications.

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:51.140
And java clearly is the market leader in creating web applications,

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.260
especially some of the financial management applications

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.095
where securities the utmost priority.

00:00:57.095 --> 00:00:59.495
Like banking application, for example,

00:00:59.495 --> 00:01:03.050
where you need to perform secure transactions.

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.745
Java is used for creating Android applications as well.

00:01:07.745 --> 00:01:10.715
80% of the smartphone market is Android,

00:01:10.715 --> 00:01:15.335
and majority of those apps are developed, isn't Java programming.

00:01:15.335 --> 00:01:19.940
Java is also one of the popular choice for creating standalone applications.

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.315
Some of the examples are like you have notepad or

00:01:23.315 --> 00:01:28.535
Photoshop or some audio editing software, Audacity, et cetera.

00:01:28.535 --> 00:01:33.800
And Java is one of the popular choices for creating standalone applications like that.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.950
Although C plus plus is also one of the popular choices.

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.470
Java is also used inside embedded devices,

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.450
like remote control, TV,

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.250
set-top boxes, et cetera.

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.355
And with the Java nine module system,

00:01:49.355 --> 00:01:51.260
things have become much easier,

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.985
which makes Java even more compatible with embedded devices.

00:01:55.985 --> 00:02:00.335
All the C Plus Plus is primarily used for game development.

00:02:00.335 --> 00:02:03.755
Java is nonetheless, it comes next to C plus plus.

00:02:03.755 --> 00:02:06.455
And one of the popular games that I know off

00:02:06.455 --> 00:02:09.650
and that is developed using Java is Minecraft.

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:13.130
And obviously, majority of the games that you play on

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.000
Android devices were actually developed is in Java.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.510
Java is used in scientific applications as well.

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:21.935
As you might know.

00:02:21.935 --> 00:02:26.765
For scientific applications, performance and speed are primary concerns,

00:02:26.765 --> 00:02:30.180
and Java perfectly fits into that groove.

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.444
Java is also used in automated teller machines.

00:02:34.444 --> 00:02:37.025
When you withdraw cash from the atm.

00:02:37.025 --> 00:02:40.940
This system would make sure that it will deduct that much amount from

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:46.475
your account for dispensing the cache and even send you an SMS regarding the same.

00:02:46.475 --> 00:02:49.730
Well, that logic is written using Java.

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.990
Java has a huge market share in big data segment as well.

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.765
Some of the popular tools that are developed using Java,

00:02:56.765 --> 00:02:58.700
or we have Hadoop,

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.995
Hive, Spark, et cetera.

00:03:00.995 --> 00:03:06.110
Without these tools, there is no question of performing analytics.

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.840
Although our languages, the popular choice

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.094
for machine learning and performing data analytics,

00:03:12.094 --> 00:03:15.860
Java is nonetheless, is also one of the popular options.

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.270
Java also has some pretty good libraries to support machine learning

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:24.410
and data science and to perform things like data mining,

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.115
data analytics, predictive modelling, etcetera.

00:03:28.115 --> 00:03:31.010
Java literally left no stone untouched,

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.975
and it has also gained traction in IoT segment as well.

00:03:35.975 --> 00:03:38.030
So if you learn C plus plus,

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.400
then your KD options might be limited

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.730
to game development or creating standalone applications.

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:45.500
Or if you learn our language,

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:51.004
then you're carried options could be limited to data mining or data analytics.

00:03:51.004 --> 00:03:52.460
But if you learn Java,

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:55.070
you have all these kidded options.

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:56.990
And for that reason,

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:59.915
as per the data from Indeed and Glassdoor,

00:03:59.915 --> 00:04:04.730
Java has the most number of job openings than any other technology.

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.900
And this is as per the medium.com statistics,

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:14.150
the demand of Java among all of the programming languages is the highest.

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:20.555
And the average salary for Java developer in USDA's around a $120 thousand,

00:04:20.555 --> 00:04:25.160
which is 77% higher than the average salaries.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.590
Java is secure, robust,

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.800
reliable, dynamic, and scalable language,

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.280
which will make it the best choice for developing enterprise,

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.785
so web and mobile applications.

00:04:36.785 --> 00:04:41.255
Some of the popular global investment banks like Goldman Sachs,

00:04:41.255 --> 00:04:43.970
Citigroup, Barclays, Standard Chartered,

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:46.610
and other banks use Java.

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:51.125
Android takes about 82% of the smartphone market worldwide,

00:04:51.125 --> 00:04:56.430
and Java is the official language of choice for developing Android apps.

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:02.330
Here are some of the popular websites that are developed is in Java.

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.100
We have linkedin.com.

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.490
We also have AWS dot amazon.com.

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:09.665
I'm not sure if you're aware of AWS,

00:05:09.665 --> 00:05:12.965
but this is a huge project and

00:05:12.965 --> 00:05:17.540
the entire AWS application is developed and powered by Java.

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:21.665
Similarly, we got other popular websites like AliExpress.com.

00:05:21.665 --> 00:05:24.650
We got IRC, tissue dot co-taught in eBay,

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:28.200
Best Buy, open caught, etc.
