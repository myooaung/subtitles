00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.440
in this video,

00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:03.970
we're gonna talk about wild cards in Java,

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:04.180
Gen.

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:04.650
Ricks.

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.800
First of all,

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:12.500
I think it's not really worth knowing about wild cards because it does exactly what type

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.960
perimeters does with only one noticeable difference.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.690
So if whatever we had talked about so far sounds confusing to you,

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:27.980
then you can simply skip this video and go ahead with my other videos.

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.680
That being said,

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.490
I'm going to talk about the wild cards anyway,

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:34.640
just for the sake of completeness.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.650
So what are wild cards before we understand what it is?

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:39.390
Take a look at this example.

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.090
In this class,

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:42.520
I have one method,

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.090
and it's going to accept object as a perimeter.

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:47.890
No sins,

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.610
string and integer are sub classes off the object class.

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.790
We can also pass the string and ended your objects to this method,

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:04.780
and that's exactly what we did here and it except But let's ever sending a list.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.450
Let me income in the court that I've commented here.

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.870
Let's get it off this.

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:21.520
Let's hear the fine in here have created three lists.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.080
One is off object,

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.960
the others off string and the other is off integer,

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.100
and I've added some elements into this lists.

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:39.810
But the point here is this method in here is going to accept and aerialist off objects.

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.710
So obviously,

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.750
since this is an analyst off objects,

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.060
we can pause this to this method without any problem.

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.140
But if I try to pass this,

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.150
which is a list off string objects to this matter,

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:59.960
will it accept it?

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.510
Can you make a guess?

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:03.060
The answer is no.

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.350
All the string is a surplus object.

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:14.550
Java does not really typecast his entire spring list into list off objects.

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.040
In other words,

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.730
Job Akin typecast a string or an indigent to an object implicitly,

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.220
but it cannot really convert list off string Orly.

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.780
Stop indigenous into list off objects.

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.600
These two are two different things.

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:31.950
I hope that's clear.

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.770
And so,

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.780
if I'm coming these two lines off court,

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:41.410
it's going to show a compile time error that's going to say the matter.

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.000
Despair list a realist off objects in the type wild cards.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.180
The name of this class is not applicable for arguments analyst off string,

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.030
and that's very obvious,

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.350
as I've explained.

00:02:54.350 --> 00:03:02.020
So what can it do to this mattered in here so that it's going to accept any type of

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.680
argument.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:03.690
Obviously,

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.510
we're going to make yourself generates.

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.950
So we're going tohave a type Param eter in here,

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:14.090
and we're gonna give that gender perimeter type in here,

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.650
and this is going to solve the problem.

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.350
But in here,

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:23.790
since the type perimeter is appearing only once in this list off para meters,

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:32.130
we can simply get rid off this and instant use a question mark sign and guess what?

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.220
This is nothing but a wild card.

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:40.750
The only difference between having to use the type Param Eter versus the wild card is that

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:46.030
the wild card makes it makes this matter look more obvious that it can accept any kind of

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.130
perimeter syntactical.

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:49.570
It looks more appealing.

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:50.950
So basically,

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:51.910
in other words,

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.650
the portion mark or the wild card means an unknown type.

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.550
That means compiler does not know what type of argument this matter is going to receive

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:02.970
during the compile time.

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.640
It knows it when we run the program.

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:06.850
And as I said,

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.190
we can still use type perimeters.

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:12.080
This just looks visually more appealing.

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:17.850
But if you have this method accepting more than one argument,

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:19.900
both are off genic type.

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.260
Then you would better off go but type perimeter rather than using a Bible card.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.190
The reason is let me show you what I mean.

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.050
Say you have another argument in here.

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:42.960
That's call it D or whatever and come in the code in here you can send list off objects has

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:42.960
,

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:43.740
alas,

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.270
the list off strength.

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:50.110
These two arguments in here may not be off same type,

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:56.080
so that will bring some additional complexity in handling those perimeters inside your

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.450
method.

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:58.150
So in this case,

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:02.390
it would make more sense to use a type perimeter like tea,

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:04.980
And then you're gonna tell it over here.

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:10.770
So that way you will get there during the compile time itself.

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:17.110
So either you should have both these arguments a list off objects or a list off string,

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:18.200
but not both.

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:22.450
So you can send like this now this is going to be acceptable.

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:24.350
Hope that makes sense.

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:25.920
Let's under those changes.

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:36.720
And I was mentioning that there is one noticeable difference between a wild card and the

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:37.700
type perimeter.

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:40.780
Is that in type Param eter?

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:44.070
We can limit the type off argument that's going to come in.

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:46.010
Isn't the extents keyword?

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:47.000
For example,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:55.450
if I say extends number so we cannot send object or a string because we're accepting only

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:57.550
the classes that are extending number.

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:00.960
This is possible even with the wild cards.

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:06.240
But there's one thing which is possible with wild cards and is not possible with type

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:11.950
parameters is you can use super keyboard or let's say it into jer.

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:14.270
Now guess what?

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:17.440
Since object is super class often,

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:18.030
teacher,

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:26.130
we can pass a their object at the list of objects are Let's stop into just but not list off

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:26.590
strengths.

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:28.850
And that's where we have a combat a mirror here.

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:31.420
So that's a down bile cards.

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:35.650
We don't really need to know a tad bit more than what I've just explained.

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:38.350
So see you in my next video.
