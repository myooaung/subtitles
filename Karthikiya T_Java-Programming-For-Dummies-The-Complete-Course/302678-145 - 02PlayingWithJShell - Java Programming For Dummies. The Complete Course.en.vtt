00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.555
All right. Let us try to play a next permanent with j shall,

00:00:03.555 --> 00:00:07.530
in order for additional to work into foster install Java,

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:09.510
which I assume it did incase.

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.540
If you want to verify you've successfully installed java,

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.150
just type in the command java hyphen version.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.390
And it should be able to see the version of Java that you've installed.

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:19.845
Once you do that,

00:00:19.845 --> 00:00:22.425
typing the command J shell,

00:00:22.425 --> 00:00:25.335
just as you have the commands Java and Java C,

00:00:25.335 --> 00:00:27.405
you also have the j shell.

00:00:27.405 --> 00:00:29.505
And once you hit Enter,

00:00:29.505 --> 00:00:31.874
you're going to see a welcome message.

00:00:31.874 --> 00:00:34.800
Along with that, it has also indicated us to take a look at

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.480
the help document by typing in help.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.480
So this is all joshua has to offer us.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:51.600
What we're going to experiment with right now are var sought variables and methods.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:57.575
I'm going to say i equals ten to start with.

00:00:57.575 --> 00:01:00.785
And this is going to show us an error.

00:01:00.785 --> 00:01:02.900
If you are an experienced dollar per,

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.120
you probably know what this arrow means.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.215
This means that we don't have a variable i in order to assign a value to it.

00:01:09.215 --> 00:01:10.985
Java is strongly typed language,

00:01:10.985 --> 00:01:12.980
and when you declare a variable,

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:19.325
you have to be specific about the type of data that a variable can hold.

00:01:19.325 --> 00:01:21.875
But if you think from the beginner prospect to

00:01:21.875 --> 00:01:24.555
the probably don't understand what this arrow means.

00:01:24.555 --> 00:01:26.425
And in order to understand this,

00:01:26.425 --> 00:01:28.315
they're probably going to do a Google search.

00:01:28.315 --> 00:01:30.400
And when they do a Google search,

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.860
they're probably going to come across with public static,

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.165
void main, and they'll be lost in a different world altogether.

00:01:37.165 --> 00:01:43.135
So this is something that I wish that the Java community might want to improve upon.

00:01:43.135 --> 00:01:46.360
The better be more specific about the errors so that

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.560
a beginner can actually understand it in better fashion.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.635
So instead of saying I equals ten,

00:01:53.635 --> 00:01:57.910
I'm going to say int i equals ten.

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:03.235
And this works. I'm going to initialize another variable,

00:02:03.235 --> 00:02:08.075
j equals i plus 20.

00:02:08.075 --> 00:02:14.765
So this is an expression and that has been evaluated to 30.

00:02:14.765 --> 00:02:21.830
We can also type in any valid Java statement system dot out, dot, print,

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:30.095
Ellen, hello, world, or whatever.

00:02:30.095 --> 00:02:32.060
And it walks.

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.460
We can also write methods.

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:39.905
I'm going to say wide map, accept no arguments.

00:02:39.905 --> 00:02:42.710
And I'm simply going to print out something.

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:49.895
System. Dot out, dot, print L1.

00:02:49.895 --> 00:03:01.745
Some is, I'm going to say hi plus j.

00:03:01.745 --> 00:03:07.084
So this should ideally be printing 40.

00:03:07.084 --> 00:03:09.140
Okay, method has been created and the way you call

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.990
it is you don't have to create instances.

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:18.395
Can say map, and that would execute that method.

00:03:18.395 --> 00:03:20.570
Now you might be wondering.

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:24.755
How general is able to memorize the data that we've entered,

00:03:24.755 --> 00:03:26.825
the variables, the methods, et cetera.

00:03:26.825 --> 00:03:29.570
Well behind the scenes it's actually maintaining

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:32.060
a class file with whatever the methods and

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.955
variables that we are trying to experiment here.

00:03:34.955 --> 00:03:38.780
But it's going to abstract all that stuff from the user.

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:44.105
Because of the fact that it is assumed that business would actually play with this tool.

00:03:44.105 --> 00:03:46.370
And they don't want to complicate things.

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.030
Obviously, that's the very reason why gestural even come into picture.

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.730
Going back to our earlier example where you're

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.435
a serious professional who's trying to understand the length of a string,

00:03:56.435 --> 00:04:03.875
you can enter John Doe dot length.

00:04:03.875 --> 00:04:08.645
And this should print the length of John Doe.

00:04:08.645 --> 00:04:12.110
You want to verify the length method would also

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:16.205
consider whitespaces as a single character.

00:04:16.205 --> 00:04:20.930
I'm going to enter multiple whitespaces and hit enter, and it shows 18,

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:24.050
which means I can conclude that the length method would

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.190
consider whitespaces as a character.

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:33.990
Let's take a look at what else we have under the help document.

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.650
We have list.

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.335
It's going to list a source you have typed.

00:04:39.335 --> 00:04:45.645
Let's do that real quick as a list.

00:04:45.645 --> 00:04:53.299
So these are all the set of commands are the expressions that we have entered.

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.575
You can also edit a specific item by its ID.

00:04:59.575 --> 00:05:02.035
So these are the IDs.

00:05:02.035 --> 00:05:07.000
Lets I would like to change the value of i to something else.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.230
So I'm going to say edit one.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:20.290
Ok, this has shown us that cute little prompt where we can

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:27.860
actually do some edits when to change this value to a 100 and say Accept.

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:32.230
So the value has been changed to a 100.

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:34.720
Now if I call Matt,

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:38.965
obviously, this will show the updated value.

00:05:38.965 --> 00:05:45.250
And likewise we got other commands that we can run.

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:50.950
You also got saved in case we'd like to save this session.

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:54.145
By the way, fix it out of the gestural by entering exit,

00:05:54.145 --> 00:05:56.440
then everything would be lost.

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.380
So maybe you want to save it.

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:03.100
Can just save it into a file.

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:06.400
And then you can open it by pointing to that file.

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:11.510
So you can continue working from where you have left previously.

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:16.640
Imports would just show us list off imports.

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:21.610
It's pretty straightforward.

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:25.315
So that's pretty much what gestural has to offer.

00:06:25.315 --> 00:06:27.070
But like I said before,

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:28.555
this is not a full-fledged,

00:06:28.555 --> 00:06:31.060
complete beginner friendly tool.

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:33.085
Because as a beginner,

00:06:33.085 --> 00:06:35.545
if they won't experiment with variables and methods,

00:06:35.545 --> 00:06:37.720
they probably need to know what is a variable.

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:42.295
And in order to know that they need to write a program and to write a program.

00:06:42.295 --> 00:06:44.995
There, they're going to see public static void main,

00:06:44.995 --> 00:06:48.160
and questions would start popping up.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:51.565
So we can think of this tool as something that's,

00:06:51.565 --> 00:06:57.380
that's more like a confidence builder than to do anything significant.

00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:59.900
But for an experience, dollar per,

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:05.510
this is a quick tool that you can just simply launch and execute few statements.

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:08.190
If the need arises.
