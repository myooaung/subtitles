00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.970
there could be times where you want string to be mutable.

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:06.370
That means changeable.

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:07.770
In that case,

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.450
you want to use string before class.

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:15.590
It's expended have an object off string before,

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:22.150
and I'm sending his string as an argument to its constructor.

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.880
I'm also calling you matter inside it happened.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:32.650
This will upend this string basically whatever I send as an argument to that matter.

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.870
And this works.

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:41.890
This didn't in here the club board these strengths and print as a single string.

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:47.650
The key thing to understand is we're able to modify the string itself.

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:54.380
So what is one good reason why you would want to use string?

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:58.680
Buffer is it has performance advantage.

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.170
For example,

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:01.590
take a look at this line.

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:09.770
We have two strings and using the press operator were performing concatenation all that.

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:16.320
This this land looks simpler than these three lines In terms of performance,

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.850
this will perform better.

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.580
Also,

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.970
there are some methods that are part off string buffer that you can utilize.

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:26.650
For example,

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.490
we can insert some text,

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.450
had a particular point in that string.

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.810
In this case,

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:43.130
we're trying to insert this text that index tent and we're printing the statement.

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.200
We can also divorce the string.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.870
This will reverse the string.

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.150
Let's run this program.

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:59.990
These two strings are clubbed.

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.670
I'm able to upend the string and,

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:04.350
uh,

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.570
in here,

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.250
who inserted this text at index 10.

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.220
So that's some text inserted,

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.450
and we reversed everything the entire string.

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.260
It's better to use mics off both.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.870
So once I do,

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.360
all sorts off manipulations are going to do with the string.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:35.470
It's better that we convert that string buffer to a string class using the method to a

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.950
string.

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.750
So once we convert this toe string,

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.480
then again the string will become immutable,

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.930
so you can utilize the advantages off board,

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:53.140
string and sting before we'll talk more on the string,

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.770
buffer,

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:54.170
string,

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.070
class and string boulder at later point of time.

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:03.540
Once we covered the concept off multi trading for now,

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.010
this should suffice.

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.790
See you in my next video
