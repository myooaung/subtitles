00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.160
We've been using streams through order examples even before this chapter.

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:11.120
And those streams are something that would didn't create those were created by the Java

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.050
virtual machine.

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:18.510
I'm talking about system not in system that out and system dot error.

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.640
Let's talk about system not in system.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.340
Lauren is a stream that is connected to one source.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.310
The default source All systems are in would be your keyboard.

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.550
So whenever you have this defined just from not in,

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.050
then you're actually doing something with your keyboard.

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.470
This will let you enter something from your keyboard while your program is running.

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:43.320
Now,

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:43.850
I said,

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.150
System not in is an input stream,

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:47.980
but it's also a source.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.350
It is a source to this object.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:52.550
The scanner.

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.010
We could use input Stream reader,

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:00.290
but the problem with that is we would only be able to enter one character at a time.

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.170
But whereas if we use scanner,

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.580
you can enter bunch of characters.

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:05.390
I mean string.

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.040
So hence I use the scanner and using the scanner,

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.380
I'm going to invoke the matter inside it,

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:12.680
which is next line.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.850
This will let me enter the value when the program is running.

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:17.970
Similarly,

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:18.470
we have.

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:19.950
We're taking another input,

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.250
which is the last name.

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.960
Let's talk about system that out.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.270
It's an output stream,

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.610
and the deep hole destination for the stream is going to be your console.

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:38.050
And that's why whenever you use the statement system dot R dot print Ellen and you provide

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:39.080
something inside it,

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.050
you would say something on your console.

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:42.680
The system,

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:43.520
not error,

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.120
is no different from system that out,

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:51.960
except there is some formatting done that will make the text look like an error.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.280
Whenever we get an exception,

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.940
we see red color text on or console internally.

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:59.000
It had used system,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.210
not error to display the text.

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.980
Even when you're creating a custom exception,

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.900
it's always advisable that you use system,

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:07.530
not error,

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.450
since Ralph System not out.

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.350
Now let's run the program.

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:21.880
And when they enter the first name and last name and we have the output Now,

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.770
do taken note that when we adduced system that error,

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.350
the texture is actually highlighted in red.

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:28.530
All right,

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:29.650
see you in my next radio
