00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.340
all right,

00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:05.500
We're not really going to talk about anything in specific in this video.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:11.030
I just want to point out that there are many different classes and interfaces present in

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:13.550
the Java Util conquering package.

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:16.030
Please go ahead and explore them.

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:20.710
You can just understand what each one of these classes does.

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:22.760
Just bay reading the description.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.960
If you go down a little bit,

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.350
he can also find in a bunch off collections.

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:30.110
We've talked about hash map,

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:30.700
for instance,

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:31.960
in our collections chapter,

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.850
but in here we got the congruent hash map,

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.350
which actually implements the map interface on the purpose off.

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:47.530
This collection is to use hash map in the context off multitude programming likewise begat

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:55.610
money such classes so you don't want to use a hash map a normal hash map when you're

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.540
dealing with multiple threads,

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.450
that's going to cause a lot of issues.

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:05.860
So just go ahead and explore all these classes and interfaces.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:12.110
And I bet you don't like me to go through each one of these classes and given example about

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.950
it because guess what.

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.780
We just don't want to dedicate our life in just learning.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.530
We want to do something from what we have learned,

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.850
and if I have to go through each and every thing that job offers,

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.900
it's going to take forever.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.620
I will keep teaching you and you will keep learning,

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.890
and that's never going to end.

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:40.670
But what I made sure is that I have introduced you all the key concepts present in job,

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:46.090
and you're now capable off exploring new concepts on your own.

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:47.650
So with this video,

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:52.900
I think we're done with this chapter off multi threading See you in my next video.
