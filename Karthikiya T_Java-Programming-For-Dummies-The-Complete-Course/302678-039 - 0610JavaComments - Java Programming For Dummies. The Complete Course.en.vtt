00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.450
in this video,

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:07.630
I'm going to talk about comments in Java coming toward their for the convenience off the

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:13.280
programmer they just describe your court is it's a responsibility off the individual

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.160
programmer to comment on his or her code.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.600
That being said,

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.820
it's not mandatory.

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:20.630
It's just a good practice.

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:21.550
In fact,

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.050
compilers will simply ignore all the comments while comparing the court.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.350
All the great extreme here will be ignored by the compiler.

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:34.550
These are desirable comments that are meant for the Ripper's,

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.980
so you shouldn't be the only person who understand your court.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.180
You also need to think about the programmers who will come and take a look at your chord at

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:44.190
later point of time.

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.080
Even they should be able to understand.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.950
And one way to come way what your court is doing is through comments.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.700
Now there are two types of comments.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:58.120
One is what the programmers was going to take a look at your core and possibly make

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.010
modifications,

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:05.110
and the other is for the programmers who will not be able to take a look at your court but

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:06.050
can use your court.

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.550
Let me explain you what I mean.

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:15.510
I'm initializing couple of variables in here and have mentioned the same thing as a comment

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:22.730
in here x and y our valuables and are initialized here to make a single and comment you to

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:24.360
use double slash like this.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.750
However,

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:31.070
if your comment is spanned across multiple lanes like this,

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.740
then you need to enclose them within slash star and star slash.

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:42.840
Not these two comings that I've shown you are for the programmers who is going to take a

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.910
look at your source code and make modifications.

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:52.930
But if I have just commented on these initializing the very boats in real world usually

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:53.500
don't come.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:54.730
And on such simple,

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:55.890
simple lines,

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.780
we would usually comment on methods,

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:06.350
constructors and objects that usually a programmer is not aware off.

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.120
Okay,

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.890
moving on now,

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.750
the second type of comment is documentation coming.

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.620
This is little tricky.

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.050
Let's say I wanted everybody to use my class.

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.510
Use the functionality on providing,

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.640
for example,

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.400
I wanted somebody else to make use of the method,

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.770
all right.

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.700
But at the same time,

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:33.050
I don't want anybody to make changes to my court or copy my court how to handle this.

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.180
How simply compelled this court.

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.650
I get a dark class file.

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:43.130
I'll share the dark last file to everybody and they will be able to create an object off

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.800
this class and then call this matter whatever.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.580
But since they cannot take a look at my source good.

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.350
How would they see the comments inside it?

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.170
They cannot compile Russian off the job.

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:55.630
If I will not have comments anyway,

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.530
s how does all the problem?

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.550
How do we tell the programmer what we're doing in the source code?

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:07.650
History Documentation Cummings for documentation comment The start with slash double star

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.990
and ends with a star slash with the star in each line.

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:19.150
And there is a specific former that in to follow when it comes to documentation coming,

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.350
we can also use the tanks like this.

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.310
All the tags will stop,

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:25.590
but at the right symbol,

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.250
you'll see in a minute why we have tags.

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.850
We noted To generate documentation for this class file,

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:36.950
we need to use a tool called Java Doc.

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.450
It comes with the Jedi K.

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.750
You don't have to install it separately.

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:49.530
Just as Java Sea is a compiler dot doc is a tool that will generate the documentation off

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:56.910
your program based on the documentation comments to provide that to build generator has

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:57.840
team a document,

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.040
which you can share it to anybody that you wish.

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:06.610
So let's try to use that to you need to open a command processor and never get to any

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:07.910
directory that you wish.

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:13.160
This would be the directory where our documentation files will be generated by the tool,

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.120
and all you have to do is use this tool Java dark,

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:22.350
and then give the complete part of the Java file to get the complete part.

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:28.970
Can simply go to properties off the file and you find the complete part in here.

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.950
You can copy that and piss that.

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:34.090
Who would?

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:35.050
The command processor?

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.950
Let's go back.

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:45.580
Let's get inside the folder and make sure nothing is there in the directory or the folder.

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.200
By then,

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.970
I use mics off terms like directory or the folder they would refer to.

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:55.600
Same because usually very programmers use landing system,

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.550
and the folder in Windows is directory in Lenox.

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:00.790
OK,

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:01.360
moving on.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.470
Let's run this command.

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:07.560
Let's go to that directory.

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:11.550
Open this HTML file.

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:13.400
If you're not aware off his team,

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:14.050
all that's fine.

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:15.180
We're gonna talk about it.

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:16.830
We're gonna talk about it in the future.

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:17.500
Videos.

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:21.090
That's like this job documents.

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:23.710
We have a description of the class.

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:28.920
This program will demonstrate the use off gentle comments list off constructors that this

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:29.950
class is holding.

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:31.950
Currently it's the default one.

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:36.150
And since we didn't provide any documentation cummings for this constructor,

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:37.950
it showing nothing.

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:43.980
But we do have documentation Cummings for method,

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:44.870
addition.

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:48.550
And then the signature of the method.

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:53.550
A quick summary of the method using annotations.

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:55.250
We have described the perimeters.

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:58.710
Now you can observe why we have an addition.

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:06.670
It will just give a proper separate section dedicated for that para meters and the returns

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:08.980
annotation Here is the description board,

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:15.270
third party programmer who's going to use your class file to use the functionality can take

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:16.270
a look at this esteem.

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:16.370
Oh,

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:20.890
document and get a sense on what these methods are constructors are doing.

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:27.540
Let's go back and do take note that we can also use tags in here.

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:30.230
These are his Timo tags again.

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:33.100
You might not be able off his team of the Tok.

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:34.450
We're gonna talk about it.

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:37.070
So that's it.

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:40.800
But wait a minute since the documentation.

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:43.630
Comment is not off utmost importance.

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:49.180
I'm not going to go deep into this because I feel it's not what the at least at this point

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:49.690
of time,

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:52.200
when you enter the mainstream,

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:55.520
you'll be forced to do documentation comments anyway.

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:59.290
So it's not really what spending time going deep into this.

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:00.820
We have a mountain off,

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:02.320
other topics to be covered.

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:03.240
And,

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:03.750
ah,

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:04.990
I understand.

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:06.810
So let's not waste time in here,

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:08.310
but in Justin guests.

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:13.310
Although I'm not recommending If you wanted to go through all the description of Java doc

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:17.800
and go through and understand what or what are all the tax that we have,

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.550
then you can get inside this link.

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:25.070
Here.

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:27.400
You can see the introduction off it.

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:30.880
You also have a tool dot com,

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:35.930
and check in to this will check to see if your documentation come in is in proper form.

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:36.440
It or not,

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:43.930
it's really important that you do proper for mating are to follow certain guidelines while

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:45.450
providing the doc comments.

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:46.800
Otherwise you want.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:50.280
You will see your text not getting populated in here.

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:56.850
So it's always good to use this tool because in mainstream you'll have a book off

00:07:56.850 --> 00:07:57.900
documentation,

00:07:57.900 --> 00:07:58.550
any source,

00:07:58.550 --> 00:07:58.910
while.

00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:04.210
So it's always better that you run your file through this tool and then see if there are

00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:05.390
any formatting errors.

00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:11.260
It takes a lot of time to manually verify the documentation comings and see.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:12.750
And guess what's going wrong.

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:16.690
So this door will definitely come in very handy for it.

00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:26.550
You can also go to all this description and all these Ah tags in here.

00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:29.450
We We've already used this Param tank.

00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:32.830
The return return tag,

00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:33.550
etcetera.

00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:37.750
All right,

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:39.770
see you in my next radio.
