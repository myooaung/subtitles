00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.650
everyone Welcome to the next video.

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:07.820
So this point we went through most of Sigma learning the in and outs of the design and the

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:12.810
tools and all the functions for that particular designs that we created and the prototyping

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:12.810
.

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:18.150
The next series of videos is more around showing you how to invite people to your board.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.960
How did export U.

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.230
Y assets keyboard shortcuts,

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.240
plug ins,

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:24.450
how to create comments,

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:28.700
some final thoughts going forward to the pretty short videos just to show you how toe

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:33.910
continually work with Sigma as you work with teams and work with others and how to get more

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:34.650
efficient with it.

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:35.810
Okay,

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:40.090
so let's go ahead and look at how to invite others and what collaboration looks like in fig

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.470
MMA,

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.540
as well as how to export u I assets like icons,

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:45.130
um,

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:48.980
and illustrations and how to inspect code for engineers.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:56.610
So if you go to our file here that we were at and we can go to let's go back to our

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:56.950
learning.

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:57.330
Paige,

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.850
this is the page where we created our prototype here.

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:08.840
Have you want invite anybody to collaborate on this board here and they'll have access to

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.070
all of the pages here.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.550
Pretty much this whole file.

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.850
All you have to do is go up here to share,

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.790
click on the share link,

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:17.480
and you have two options.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.040
You can make them a viewer or editor.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.710
So if you are allows them to feet view the art words they can get into the,

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:25.010
um,

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.740
art boards.

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:26.590
Take a look at it.

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.020
They can look at the prototypes,

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.130
but they won't be able to change things around.

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.050
They won't be able to design like we did.

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.570
If you make them an editor,

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.530
then they're gonna They can come into your art board and they can change things.

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:39.020
Taken,

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.270
taken,

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.610
do pretty much full access to fig MMA,

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:42.850
just like you have it.

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:49.850
And for the view of you were only that's a free one.

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:55.020
You can invite as many viewers as you want to your board as you've invite Mawr editors.

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.700
I think you have about three that you can invite.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:58.290
After that,

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.050
you start to pay for the tool,

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:05.390
so it's pretty much free for you to use and invite as many viewers as you want to.

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.680
But once you invite more people to edit your board,

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.490
it becomes a subscription model.

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:11.600
Okay,

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.870
cool.

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.160
So you can just go through,

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.270
invite as many people as you want to.

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.460
What it looks like when they're in your your board is pretty neat.

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.570
This is one of my favorite features in fig.

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.900
MMA.

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:22.620
Um,

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.770
so let's say I've went over here.

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:25.790
I got a,

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:26.160
um,

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.390
View or Edit link here.

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:29.350
Um,

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.450
and I've added somebody or clicked on the view at it here.

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:33.680
And let's say I added,

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.350
Somebody's email may just put me in for right now.

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:44.550
There's my email that I sent an email out.

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.860
Whoever gets that email say it's an engineer.

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:54.560
They'll open up that email and they'll have access to Fig MMA on their desktop in a

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:55.580
Internet browser.

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.200
They won't need to install software.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.540
It will be free for them.

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.080
They just open up a browser window on their Internet,

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.150
and they'll have access to this file like you see here,

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:06.210
some in the Internet.

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.640
Right now,

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.480
I'm in chrome and they'll have access this file.

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.310
They can work and design just like we did,

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:12.580
but within the browser.

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:19.700
And what's really neat is if you're working on your file and this person comes into the um

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.960
the person you invited comes into this board.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:28.610
You can see their mouths so you can see I have two A's with purple circles here in the top

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.610
,

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:29.020
right?

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.650
And one is Aaron Lawrence saying It's me.

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.290
Another one is me as well,

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:39.460
But this would be you'll see more than one of these little profile icons here at the top.

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:42.990
And those are the people that are in your board right now working.

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:44.720
So if I zoom out a little bit,

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:50.480
you'll be able to see my mouse from the other project that I was on.

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.650
So let me go back over here.

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.740
And so now I'm in the browser window.

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:58.710
I'm that user that I invited.

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:00.480
And if I come back to Fig MMA,

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.330
I can see my mouse here so I can see the people in my board.

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.630
I can see what they're doing in real time,

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.460
and we can collaborate together.

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:16.080
It's a lot of times I've used this by opening up a screen sharing software or a ah video

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.180
call with somebody,

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:18.340
and we're on the phone.

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:19.530
We're chatting together.

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:24.460
We're also working together in Fig MMA so we can chat.

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:25.860
I can talk to this person.

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.650
I can see their mouths moving and we can collaborate together.

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:29.950
So it's really great.

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:32.850
You can send this to product managers.

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.480
Engineers invite them to collaborate with you,

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:40.650
and you could see them and spy on them as they continually work on fig mo with you,

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.790
they can also see your mouse as well,

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:44.080
so they know that you're in the board.

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:51.580
And another thing that they can do here is so if you wanna continually invite more people

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.110
into fig MMA,

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:57.950
another approach to this is we just invited somebody into our board or file here.

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:00.600
You can also create teams.

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.000
So here I have a ah new project,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:04.730
a new team,

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:07.050
and I compress new project here.

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:13.420
Aiken type in a new team name and I can create a team over here and within a team I can

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:14.730
Aiken invite.

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:17.310
Um I can add boards to this team,

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:22.180
and I could invite people to just this team and have a series of boards.

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:25.570
So that way I can have my own personal projects in my drafts,

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:28.970
and I can have my team projects within my team here.

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:35.050
I can also go and invite people to this team so you can see I have a board here.

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:36.680
I have my team,

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.970
and if I want to invite anybody,

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:44.330
I gotta members and I compress the invite here and do the same thing.

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:46.170
I can invite people to view or edit,

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:50.270
and they'll have access to all of the boards within this team.

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:57.410
I can also do some user management here.

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:00.650
I can change people from viewers to editors here.

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:02.280
You can second downgrade them,

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:08.460
and that's where it starts to get into.

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:13.520
A monthly cost is you want to create team to start adding editors into these boards.

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:14.910
Most of the time,

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:16.740
I don't really use team too much.

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:19.090
I just invite people to my boards here,

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:20.100
and I have ah,

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:22.370
different people in different boards that I work with.

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:29.330
And that's pretty much 90% of the cases is you're just inviting people through Ah,

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:31.010
that share button in the top right,

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:32.510
and you're adding them viewer at it.

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:35.210
If you want to get to a larger like corporation,

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:38.160
they typically will use this section here,

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:39.350
which is creating a team.

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:41.120
Okay,

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:41.530
cool.

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:44.530
Once you have people into your board,

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:45.620
if they're engineers.

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:50.230
One of my other favorite things about Fig MMA is you can let your engineers know that they

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:54.630
can inspect these designs and they can get code attributes.

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:56.750
You can all you also use them as well.

00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:01.940
So if you come over here to the right where we have designed prototype and we have the code

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:04.160
tab So if you tap on the code tab,

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.970
this is great and you click on anything here.

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:10.590
It will give you attributes toe whatever you've clicked on.

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:14.310
So you can see I've clicked on this form default here.

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:16.760
And if I click on the text,

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:18.450
it will show me the position.

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:23.560
It will show me the thought that I'm using the font style,

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:24.460
the font weight,

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:25.790
the font size,

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:26.870
the line height.

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:29.460
It will give me the letter spacing as well.

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:32.050
And they can copy this.

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:34.030
They can just select it,

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:35.950
command C and be ready to go.

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:40.860
It also does another great thing for you,

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:41.270
is it?

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:44.060
And it shows them inspections,

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:48.510
so it shows them the spacing in between the left and the right here of this form.

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:53.160
It shows them the spacing from the top of this art board to the bottom.

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:54.480
Same with this button.

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:56.440
So anything that I they click on,

00:07:56.440 --> 00:08:04.110
they can get inspection details so I can come around here over their mouths.

00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:04.360
See,

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:05.630
it's 104 on this side,

00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:06.950
one of five on that side.

00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:10.060
It's a lot of times back in the day,

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:12.620
we used tohave to inspect our,

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:13.090
um,

00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:17.290
our documents and do what we would call redlining what you're seeing here.

00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:18.630
And these were two.

00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:25.250
To inform pixel dimensions and spacing for engineers and help them break down our help.

00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:31.810
We would break down our designs to help them get understanding of how our designs are laid

00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:33.750
out from a compositional point of view.

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:35.350
But now we don't need to do that.

00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:39.950
They can just come in and then they can see based off using that code tab.

00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:43.440
What everything looks like they can click on shapes,

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:45.110
see what this width and height.

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:47.330
This here for this rectangle.

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:53.790
What color hex code it is that can copy these hex codes makes it really easy for them to

00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:55.160
inspect your design.

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:58.210
If you invite them as a viewer,

00:08:58.210 --> 00:09:00.710
they still have access to,

00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:01.780
um doing,

00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:03.130
seeing the code here.

00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:06.570
They don't need to be editors to get in here and expect your design.

00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:08.410
If they want to change anything,

00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:09.720
then they need to be an editor.

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:12.260
So you can invite an engineer just as a viewer.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:16.770
And they have the full functionality it you're seeing right here from the code tab and they

00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:19.280
can also go into the prototype is well,

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:26.940
and click around on the prototype and see how the function is cool.

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:29.770
So let's go take a look at the next point,

00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:32.250
which is how toe export assets.

00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:41.710
So let's say I wanted Teoh export this illustration of this Boba here.

00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:43.710
Fig mud does it Very simple.

00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:48.430
All you have to do is select the icon or the illustration and press.

00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:52.750
If you scroll to the bottom right here on your design tab,

00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:54.980
just press the plus button.

00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:56.210
It has the export,

00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:58.120
and then it gives you different options.

00:09:58.120 --> 00:09:58.400
Here,

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:00.090
you can do one x two x.

00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:01.310
This will blow it up,

00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:01.620
um,

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:02.260
and make it bigger.

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:03.400
So if I do two X,

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:10.490
it will make it double the size that it is right now and it has PNG J peg spg.

00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:12.540
Pdf so most of time,

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:15.530
when you're implementing for software you're not going to use.

00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:20.780
PDF use p and G for assets that have a transparent background.

00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:27.450
So pretty much an icon that you need and you use J pegs mostly just for photos.

00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:34.010
So most the time you're using either a PNG for your icons or what we call an SPG.

00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:36.190
This is a scalable vector graphic.

00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:38.780
So if I given engineer a PNG,

00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:40.770
that means they have to keep this,

00:10:40.770 --> 00:10:41.360
um,

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:43.080
icon hear it this size.

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:45.390
If they make this icon any bigger,

00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:46.650
it gets pixelated.

00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:51.660
But if I give them an SPG a scalable vector graphic,

00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:52.990
that means they can scale it.

00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:57.070
They can actually make it bigger like I'm doing right now and it stays clean.

00:10:57.070 --> 00:10:58.300
It doesn't get pixellated.

00:10:58.300 --> 00:10:59.390
As you can see the lines,

00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:00.350
you're really clean.

00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:06.180
So most of time we're giving out S P.

00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:08.940
G's for these types of icons,

00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:12.070
and all you have to do is select the icon that you would like,

00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:17.450
or the illustration that you would like select SPG press the export button here.

00:11:17.450 --> 00:11:24.810
I'm gonna put it in my download and I've exported that.

00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:29.080
So let's go take a look at what that looks like there's my Boba,

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:30.280
Tsv g,

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:33.350
and you can see it's here in the top left.

00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:36.250
Let's go do that again.

00:11:36.250 --> 00:11:38.630
Let's go grab a Nikon.

00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:42.150
Let's grab this Boba tea and me icon here.

00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:44.080
Okay,

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:45.650
so press the export.

00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:47.910
Go to S V G here,

00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:50.250
Export logo.

00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:59.450
Now it's gonna look at that Is SPG as well and you could see it here.

00:11:59.450 --> 00:12:02.950
Let's do it as a PNG so you can see.

00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:06.050
So let's go ahead and select PNG here.

00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:15.010
Export that logo and let's go take a look at what it looks like.

00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:18.350
It's a PNG to see how it has a transparent back room.

00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:32.940
Let's go do it is a J peg and you can see how has a white background now as a J peg,

00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:38.650
so figure it makes it very simple to export assets.

00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:44.830
If you select this Boba tea drink and this Boba tea,

00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:45.340
um,

00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:46.740
logo here,

00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:49.630
you can also export more than one at a time.

00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:53.720
So let's say I want those as a PNG export.

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:57.700
Those replace the files,

00:12:57.700 --> 00:12:59.850
it will export both of those.

00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:07.280
You can see the PNG here or the Boba tea,

00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:10.950
and the logo here has been exported.

00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:14.950
Let's say I want those both as one asset.

00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:20.980
So then all you have to do here is select both the illustration and the logo and right

00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:25.700
click or press command G and group these as one element.

00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:27.840
Then press the export in the bottom.

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:28.250
Right.

00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:32.290
Let's go ahead and make this A P and G Let's export it.

00:13:32.290 --> 00:13:45.480
Let's call it logo and T and you can see now this is one asset.

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:49.180
So typically,

00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:55.710
what you're gonna want to do is go through your design and export anything that can't be

00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:56.440
engineered.

00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:58.520
Which would be like this eyeball.

00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:00.950
It would be the logo in this page.

00:14:00.950 --> 00:14:05.690
Give him we'd have the logo here,

00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:08.580
these photos you'd want to export.

00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:11.460
So let's press the export here and go to J.

00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:13.980
Peg and export these photos.

00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:19.850
Now you can see the photo here.

00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:29.270
You'd want to export these little carrots that we made here for the drop down buttons.

00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:30.390
Uh,

00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:32.050
this check mark,

00:14:32.050 --> 00:14:34.360
just by selecting them,

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:37.170
you want to export this X here?

00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:42.290
They just want to go through anything that's not,

00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:42.730
um,

00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:45.520
text and colors and,

00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:46.090
uh,

00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:50.620
or buttons and just export the icons,

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:51.770
the illustrations,

00:14:51.770 --> 00:14:52.880
the photos.

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:55.990
So in this case,

00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:59.350
you'd want to export this white circle and the map,

00:14:59.350 --> 00:15:09.920
and there you have it.

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:16.160
That's pretty much what you could do to export all of your assets and put him into a folder

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:16.160
,

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:19.310
and you could be able to implement this application.

00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:19.820
Now,

00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:23.710
with the prototype and the assets that have been exported,

00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:25.590
you can hand those to your engineering team,

00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:29.350
or you could put it into the website for yourself and you be ready to go.

00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:32.600
All right,

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:37.070
so that covered mostly how to invite others into the board.

00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:42.440
What collaboration looks like being able to see other people's mouse's on and how to export

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:45.590
U Y assets and inspect code for engineering?

00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:46.450
All right,

00:15:46.450 --> 00:15:47.060
In the next video,

00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:48.780
we'll go through keyboard shortcuts.

00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:50.500
We'll look at some plug ins,

00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:51.190
Um,

00:15:51.190 --> 00:15:51.990
and I'll see you there.

00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:52.710
Thanks again.

00:15:52.710 --> 00:15:53.080
Bye.
