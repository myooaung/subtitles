00:00:00,580  -->  00:00:03,300
<v ->Hello and welcome back to the course on deep learning.</v>
2

2

00:00:03,300  -->  00:00:05,040
Today we're going to have some fun,
3

3

00:00:05,040  -->  00:00:07,490
here we've got the Boltzmaan distribution article
4

4

00:00:07,490  -->  00:00:10,960
on Wikipedia and we're going to modify it.
5

5

00:00:10,960  -->  00:00:13,090
So I haven't modified a Wikipedia article
6

6

00:00:13,090  -->  00:00:16,240
in ages but here I thought it would make sense
7

7

00:00:16,240  -->  00:00:18,700
to add a little bit to this article
8

8

00:00:18,700  -->  00:00:21,530
and I would like to see if it's going to stand
9

9

00:00:21,530  -->  00:00:23,940
the test of time, so let's go ahead and do this.
10

10

00:00:23,940  -->  00:00:26,630
So here is an article, there's the formula
11

11

00:00:26,630  -->  00:00:28,560
which we talked about, the probability
12

12

00:00:28,560  -->  00:00:31,530
and now if we scroll down you'll see here,
13

13

00:00:31,530  -->  00:00:32,680
it says...
14

14

00:00:34,350  -->  00:00:37,383
There we go, in mathematics, in more general mathematical
15

15

00:00:37,383  -->  00:00:39,480
settings the Boltzmann distribution is also known
16

16

00:00:39,480  -->  00:00:42,000
as the Gibbs measure, in statistics and machine learning
17

17

00:00:42,000  -->  00:00:44,520
it is called a log-linear model.
18

18

00:00:44,520  -->  00:00:46,130
So how about we add some information
19

19

00:00:46,130  -->  00:00:47,950
about deep learning here, it's got statistics,
20

20

00:00:47,950  -->  00:00:50,000
it's got machine learning, but not deep learning.
21

21

00:00:50,000  -->  00:00:52,950
I think it's fair to say it should say something
22

22

00:00:52,950  -->  00:00:54,930
about deep learning, and specifically the Boltzmann machine,
23

23

00:00:54,930  -->  00:00:57,590
so if you search here for machine you'll see that
24

24

00:00:57,590  -->  00:01:00,250
it doesn't mention the Boltzmann machine whatsoever.
25

25

00:01:00,250  -->  00:01:03,180
So how about we change that, so I've logged in,
26

26

00:01:03,180  -->  00:01:07,350
we're here, lets go to edit source and then we'll go to
27

27

00:01:07,350  -->  00:01:10,280
switch to editor, to visual editing
28

28

00:01:10,280  -->  00:01:13,640
and now if we scroll down here, alright,
29

29

00:01:13,640  -->  00:01:16,560
so let's copy in some text I've prepared.
30

30

00:01:16,560  -->  00:01:19,135
In deep learning the Boltzmann distribution is used
31

31

00:01:19,135  -->  00:01:22,160
in the sampling distribution of stochastic neural networks
32

32

00:01:22,160  -->  00:01:23,800
such as the Boltzmann machine.
33

33

00:01:23,800  -->  00:01:26,770
And to be consistent, let's add some links,
34

34

00:01:26,770  -->  00:01:28,570
so there's the Boltzmann machine,
35

35

00:01:28,570  -->  00:01:30,810
there we go that's the Boltzmann machine over there,
36

36

00:01:30,810  -->  00:01:34,560
let's add the link, yep done,
37

37

00:01:34,560  -->  00:01:37,230
then in deep learning,
38

38

00:01:37,230  -->  00:01:39,800
there we go deep learning we're going to link that,
39

39

00:01:39,800  -->  00:01:41,110
Is it going to link it for us?
40

40

00:01:41,110  -->  00:01:44,459
Oh okay, deep learning, yep that's the one
41

41

00:01:44,459  -->  00:01:48,450
and we want stochastic neural networks,
42

42

00:01:48,450  -->  00:01:51,390
that's the one as well, let's link that one,
43

43

00:01:51,390  -->  00:01:54,450
let's just make sure we have the right one here,
44

44

00:01:54,450  -->  00:01:58,480
stochastic neural network, done.
45

45

00:01:58,480  -->  00:02:01,260
Alright, save changes,
46

46

00:02:01,260  -->  00:02:03,570
and it says describe what you changed,
47

47

00:02:03,570  -->  00:02:08,570
added use case in deep learning,
48

48

00:02:09,170  -->  00:02:13,720
added, yeah added use case, this is a minor edit,
49

49

00:02:13,720  -->  00:02:16,370
and how about yeah, I would like to watch this page,
50

50

00:02:16,370  -->  00:02:20,100
save changes, okay let's have a look,
51

51

00:02:20,100  -->  00:02:23,023
so if I'm gonna open an incognito tab now,
52

52

00:02:24,070  -->  00:02:27,960
let's see if I can see the change still.
53

53

00:02:27,960  -->  00:02:28,793
Haha!
54

54

00:02:28,793  -->  00:02:31,450
That's so cool, in deep learning the Boltzmann distribution
55

55

00:02:31,450  -->  00:02:33,430
is used in the sampling distribution
56

56

00:02:33,430  -->  00:02:36,270
of stochastic neural networks such as the Boltzmann machine.
57

57

00:02:36,270  -->  00:02:40,210
That is so cool, so when you're watching this video,
58

58

00:02:40,210  -->  00:02:43,973
just do me a favor please, can you go to this page
59

59

00:02:43,973  -->  00:02:46,020
Boltzmann distribution on Wikipedia
60

60

00:02:46,020  -->  00:02:48,890
and see if it's still there, and post in the comments
61

61

00:02:48,890  -->  00:02:52,080
if it's not or if it is, I'm just curious
62

62

00:02:52,080  -->  00:02:54,720
of how long it will stay, this is so cool.
63

63

00:02:54,720  -->  00:02:56,670
Okay, alright, well there we go,
64

64

00:02:56,670  -->  00:02:58,690
congratulations we did this together,
65

65

00:02:58,690  -->  00:03:02,993
this is our little contribution to the world.
66

66

00:03:03,830  -->  00:03:07,250
Hopefully we'll make more, of course with all the knowledge
67

67

00:03:07,250  -->  00:03:10,380
on deep learning that we're gathering and recreating
68

68

00:03:10,380  -->  00:03:12,760
and things we'll create, but you know there it is,
69

69

00:03:12,760  -->  00:03:15,330
a little change and maybe somebody will read this article
70

70

00:03:15,330  -->  00:03:17,650
and be interested in oh what is deep learning?
71

71

00:03:17,650  -->  00:03:18,800
Oh what's the Boltzmann machine?
72

72

00:03:18,800  -->  00:03:20,780
And they'll learn more about it.
73

73

00:03:20,780  -->  00:03:22,480
Alright congratulations on that,
74

74

00:03:22,480  -->  00:03:24,240
it was a great breakthrough today,
75

75

00:03:24,240  -->  00:03:26,000
and I look forward to seeing you next time,
76

76

00:03:26,000  -->  00:03:27,893
until then, enjoy deep learning.
