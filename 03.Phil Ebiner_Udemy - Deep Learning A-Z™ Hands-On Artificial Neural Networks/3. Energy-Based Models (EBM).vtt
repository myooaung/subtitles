00:00:00.550  -->  00:00:01.470
<v Instructor>Hello and welcome back</v>
2

2

00:00:01.470  -->  00:00:03.190
to the course on Deep Learning.
3

3

00:00:03.190  -->  00:00:05.370
Today we're talking about energy-based models.
4

4

00:00:05.370  -->  00:00:09.390
And this topic is one that is not really necessary
5

5

00:00:09.390  -->  00:00:11.220
for you to be able to apply Boltzmann machines,
6

6

00:00:11.220  -->  00:00:14.820
so we could've just completely not talked about
7

7

00:00:14.820  -->  00:00:16.790
energy-based models and you would've been totally fine.
8

8

00:00:16.790  -->  00:00:18.620
You would've been able to understand them
9

9

00:00:18.620  -->  00:00:22.630
on an intuitive level and also to apply them in practice.
10

10

00:00:22.630  -->  00:00:23.900
But at the same time,
11

11

00:00:23.900  -->  00:00:26.950
if you're going to delve into the space of Deep Learning
12

12

00:00:26.950  -->  00:00:28.870
and specifically the more advanced things
13

13

00:00:28.870  -->  00:00:29.703
like Boltzmann machines,
14

14

00:00:29.703  -->  00:00:32.210
you're inevitably going to come across
15

15

00:00:32.210  -->  00:00:34.040
the term energy-based models.
16

16

00:00:34.040  -->  00:00:36.400
And we wanted to make sure you're comfortable with it.
17

17

00:00:36.400  -->  00:00:40.820
And plus it will give you that extra level of understanding,
18

18

00:00:40.820  -->  00:00:43.100
or extra level of intuitive understanding
19

19

00:00:43.100  -->  00:00:44.920
of where things are coming from,
20

20

00:00:44.920  -->  00:00:47.371
and what exactly, how exactly,
21

21

00:00:47.371  -->  00:00:49.900
to think about the Boltzmann machines
22

22

00:00:49.900  -->  00:00:53.810
and these stochastic processes that describe systems.
23

23

00:00:53.810  -->  00:00:55.230
So, let's have a look.
24

24

00:00:55.230  -->  00:00:57.300
Here we've got an equation,
25

25

00:00:57.300  -->  00:00:59.180
and by the way, have you wondered
26

26

00:00:59.180  -->  00:01:01.290
why it's called the Boltzmann machine?
27

27

00:01:01.290  -->  00:01:03.840
Well the reason is because of this equation.
28

28

00:01:03.840  -->  00:01:05.880
This is the Boltzmann distribution.
29

29

00:01:05.880  -->  00:01:07.370
It comes from physics,
30

30

00:01:07.370  -->  00:01:11.130
and it is used in the sampling distribution
31

31

00:01:11.130  -->  00:01:12.880
for the Boltzmann machine.
32

32

00:01:12.880  -->  00:01:14.390
You know how the Boltzmann machine constantly
33

33

00:01:14.390  -->  00:01:16.940
creates these different states of our system?
34

34

00:01:16.940  -->  00:01:21.030
Well in a very rough description,
35

35

00:01:21.030  -->  00:01:24.840
it's using the Boltzmann distribution
36

36

00:01:24.840  -->  00:01:27.000
as part of that process.
37

37

00:01:27.000  -->  00:01:29.270
And the Boltzmann distribution talks about probability.
38

38

00:01:29.270  -->  00:01:31.310
So, on the left we have a probability,
39

39

00:01:31.310  -->  00:01:33.690
and I know this formula look a bit complex right now,
40

40

00:01:33.690  -->  00:01:36.170
but as we go through it, you'll see that it is very simple.
41

41

00:01:36.170  -->  00:01:37.770
And then we'll look at an example
42

42

00:01:37.770  -->  00:01:40.130
of how that actually works in real life.
43

43

00:01:40.130  -->  00:01:41.690
So we've got a probability here,
44

44

00:01:41.690  -->  00:01:42.670
and this is the probability
45

45

00:01:42.670  -->  00:01:44.430
of a certain state of your system.
46

46

00:01:44.430  -->  00:01:46.990
So, we're describing the different states of our system,
47

47

00:01:46.990  -->  00:01:48.700
i is a state.
48

48

00:01:48.700  -->  00:01:50.250
This is the probability of your system
49

49

00:01:50.250  -->  00:01:51.920
being in state i.
50

50

00:01:51.920  -->  00:01:54.100
And probability of your system being in state i
51

51

00:01:54.100  -->  00:01:58.330
is equal to e, as an exponent,
52

52

00:01:58.330  -->  00:02:00.884
to the power of minus energy of that system,
53

53

00:02:00.884  -->  00:02:02.930
divided by k, T.
54

54

00:02:02.930  -->  00:02:07.930
K is constant and T is the temperature of your system.
55

55

00:02:07.940  -->  00:02:11.910
And then divided by the sum of all of those values,
56

56

00:02:11.910  -->  00:02:14.670
for all of the possible states of the system.
57

57

00:02:14.670  -->  00:02:16.700
So, it's a pretty straight-forward formula
58

58

00:02:16.700  -->  00:02:18.130
when you think about it.
59

59

00:02:18.130  -->  00:02:20.200
The important thing here to see is that
60

60

00:02:20.200  -->  00:02:22.640
e is to the power of minus energy,
61

61

00:02:22.640  -->  00:02:26.463
meaning the higher the energy of a certain state,
62

62

00:02:27.550  -->  00:02:28.980
the lower the probability.
63

63

00:02:28.980  -->  00:02:30.990
So, probability is proportional,
64

64

00:02:30.990  -->  00:02:34.910
is inversely related with energy.
65

65

00:02:34.910  -->  00:02:37.770
And so, we're kind of like assuming that the temperature,
66

66

00:02:37.770  -->  00:02:40.110
we're looking at the system at a given temperature,
67

67

00:02:40.110  -->  00:02:41.380
and this is for thermodynamics,
68

68

00:02:41.380  -->  00:02:45.694
so, in a thermodynamical system, so, for instance a gas,
69

69

00:02:45.694  -->  00:02:47.694
or it could be any kind of system right,
70

70

00:02:49.716  -->  00:02:50.549
it could be a macro system,
71

71

00:02:50.549  -->  00:02:52.180
like a gas in a bottle or in a room.
72

72

00:02:52.180  -->  00:02:53.870
It could be a micro system,
73

73

00:02:53.870  -->  00:02:56.360
it could be just some molecules together,
74

74

00:02:56.360  -->  00:02:57.900
or just one molecule.
75

75

00:02:57.900  -->  00:03:02.900
But in any case, the probability of your system
76

76

00:03:03.010  -->  00:03:06.950
being in a certain state is inversely related
77

77

00:03:06.950  -->  00:03:08.850
to the energy of your system in that state.
78

78

00:03:08.850  -->  00:03:11.670
Alright, and so, let's have a look at an example
79

79

00:03:11.670  -->  00:03:14.200
to explain this bit better.
80

80

00:03:14.200  -->  00:03:16.060
Let's say we have a room,
81

81

00:03:16.060  -->  00:03:17.660
and this is probably one of my favorite examples,
82

82

00:03:17.660  -->  00:03:18.680
and you've probably even heard
83

83

00:03:18.680  -->  00:03:20.640
of this example back in high school.
84

84

00:03:20.640  -->  00:03:21.940
Here we've got a room,
85

85

00:03:21.940  -->  00:03:24.497
and here we have let's same some people,
86

86

00:03:24.497  -->  00:03:27.200
and we have a gas, for instance air.
87

87

00:03:27.200  -->  00:03:29.270
So, have you ever thought of why the gas
88

88

00:03:29.270  -->  00:03:31.430
is distributed across the whole room?
89

89

00:03:31.430  -->  00:03:35.470
Why is the gas, for instance, not all in one corner?
90

90

00:03:35.470  -->  00:03:37.350
Cause' that could technically,
91

91

00:03:37.350  -->  00:03:40.380
there's nothing preventing that happening, right?
92

92

00:03:40.380  -->  00:03:42.250
The molecules of gas,
93

93

00:03:42.250  -->  00:03:45.410
there's nothing saying they have to be there,
94

94

00:03:45.410  -->  00:03:46.710
they have to be all over the room.
95

95

00:03:46.710  -->  00:03:47.550
They could be anywhere.
96

96

00:03:47.550  -->  00:03:50.960
They're moving around and statistically,
97

97

00:03:50.960  -->  00:03:54.090
they could end up here, this could happen,
98

98

00:03:54.090  -->  00:03:57.000
in any room, at any given point in time,
99

99

00:03:57.000  -->  00:04:02.000
this is an example of a possible state of this system,
100

100

00:04:02.230  -->  00:04:03.630
all the molecules,
101

101

00:04:03.630  -->  00:04:05.580
for instance in the room you're sitting in right now,
102

102

00:04:05.580  -->  00:04:08.850
they could decide to go all into one corner,
103

103

00:04:08.850  -->  00:04:10.910
or statistically they could end up in that corner.
104

104

00:04:10.910  -->  00:04:13.090
But what the Boltzmann distribution is saying
105

105

00:04:13.090  -->  00:04:16.170
that the probability of that state occurring is very low,
106

106

00:04:16.170  -->  00:04:18.680
because the energy in that state would be very high.
107

107

00:04:18.680  -->  00:04:20.900
Because the molecules are very close to each other,
108

108

00:04:20.900  -->  00:04:24.040
they would be bumping, they would be making a lot of chaos
109

109

00:04:24.040  -->  00:04:26.763
and havoc, and they would be moving very quickly.
110

110

00:04:27.670  -->  00:04:29.750
To be in that state, they would have to have a huge energy.
111

111

00:04:29.750  -->  00:04:31.640
Given the same temperature of the room,
112

112

00:04:31.640  -->  00:04:33.060
temperature hasn't changed,
113

113

00:04:33.060  -->  00:04:36.810
but the molecules would have to have a lot of energy,
114

114

00:04:36.810  -->  00:04:38.230
if they were gonna be in that state.
115

115

00:04:38.230  -->  00:04:40.910
And the probability is very low, and so,
116

116

00:04:40.910  -->  00:04:44.870
basically it's a translation into the language of statistics
117

117

00:04:44.870  -->  00:04:48.780
saying that, hey this could happen, probability is tiny,
118

118

00:04:48.780  -->  00:04:51.240
and what we normally observe is this,
119

119

00:04:51.240  -->  00:04:56.040
because this is the lowest energy state for that system.
120

120

00:04:56.040  -->  00:04:59.420
When the molecules are like equally spaced apart,
121

121

00:04:59.420  -->  00:05:00.430
they're just moving around,
122

122

00:05:00.430  -->  00:05:02.080
yes they're bumping occasionally,
123

123

00:05:02.080  -->  00:05:03.580
but there's no,
124

124

00:05:03.580  -->  00:05:07.410
if there were an even lower state of the system possible,
125

125

00:05:07.410  -->  00:05:09.213
then the system would eventually,
126

126

00:05:09.213  -->  00:05:11.620
would in the highest likelihood, end up in that state.
127

127

00:05:11.620  -->  00:05:13.510
But this is already the lowest
128

128

00:05:13.510  -->  00:05:15.807
energy state for the system possible,
129

129

00:05:15.807  -->  00:05:17.410
and therefore that's what it is.
130

130

00:05:17.410  -->  00:05:18.760
And that's why, for instance,
131

131

00:05:18.760  -->  00:05:20.540
we can move around and breathe
132

132

00:05:20.540  -->  00:05:22.568
and enjoy our lives as we are,
133

133

00:05:22.568  -->  00:05:25.550
without having to worry about situations like this.
134

134

00:05:25.550  -->  00:05:27.920
So, there we go, that's a quick example
135

135

00:05:27.920  -->  00:05:30.870
of the Boltzmann distribution in real life,
136

136

00:05:30.870  -->  00:05:32.020
and it applies to everything.
137

137

00:05:32.020  -->  00:05:35.060
For instance, if you dropped some ink into water,
138

138

00:05:35.060  -->  00:05:38.090
it will start spreading evenly in all directions.
139

139

00:05:38.090  -->  00:05:40.140
It won't form a star for instance.
140

140

00:05:40.140  -->  00:05:43.820
It could form a star, or a snowflake, but it's not going to
141

141

00:05:43.820  -->  00:05:46.170
because that's not the lowest energy state.
142

142

00:05:46.170  -->  00:05:47.920
On the other hand, if you drop,
143

143

00:05:47.920  -->  00:05:49.920
if you put a drop of oil into water,
144

144

00:05:49.920  -->  00:05:50.940
then it won't start spreading,
145

145

00:05:50.940  -->  00:05:53.870
it will turn into a little ball on the surface of the water,
146

146

00:05:53.870  -->  00:05:56.330
because that is the lowest energy state
147

147

00:05:56.330  -->  00:05:58.807
for that specific system.
148

148

00:05:58.807  -->  00:06:01.310
And it happens everywhere through life.
149

149

00:06:01.310  -->  00:06:03.340
And Boltzmann machines are constructed
150

150

00:06:03.340  -->  00:06:06.210
with a similar concept in mind.
151

151

00:06:06.210  -->  00:06:09.100
So, energy is defined in Boltzmann machines
152

152

00:06:09.100  -->  00:06:12.400
through the weights of synapses,
153

153

00:06:12.400  -->  00:06:16.140
and then, once the system is trained up,
154

154

00:06:16.140  -->  00:06:19.250
once the weights are set, then what happens,
155

155

00:06:19.250  -->  00:06:21.550
is the system, based on those weights,
156

156

00:06:21.550  -->  00:06:26.550
will always try to find the lowest energy state for itself.
157

157

00:06:27.214  -->  00:06:30.130
It has lots of different options, just like a gas in a room,
158

158

00:06:30.130  -->  00:06:31.760
it has lots of different options.
159

159

00:06:31.760  -->  00:06:33.920
It can be in this state, it can be in that state,
160

160

00:06:33.920  -->  00:06:38.370
but the weights will dictate what is the lowest
161

161

00:06:38.370  -->  00:06:40.750
energy state for the system,
162

162

00:06:40.750  -->  00:06:43.150
and it will constantly try to get
163

163

00:06:43.150  -->  00:06:45.910
to the lowest energy state possible.
164

164

00:06:45.910  -->  00:06:47.790
That's how it works, and that's why they're called
165

165

00:06:47.790  -->  00:06:49.630
energy-based models.
166

166

00:06:49.630  -->  00:06:52.550
And here's an example of an energy function
167

167

00:06:52.550  -->  00:06:54.730
for a restricted Boltzmann machine.
168

168

00:06:54.730  -->  00:06:55.810
We haven't talked about them yet,
169

169

00:06:55.810  -->  00:06:59.570
but we'll discuss them in the upcoming tutorial.
170

170

00:06:59.570  -->  00:07:02.120
Here I just wanted to point out that,
171

171

00:07:02.120  -->  00:07:04.960
what it would look like, so a bit different to the case
172

172

00:07:04.960  -->  00:07:08.660
of the Boltzmann distribution energy,
173

173

00:07:08.660  -->  00:07:10.100
because it's not a gas.
174

174

00:07:10.100  -->  00:07:11.580
But at the same time,
175

175

00:07:11.580  -->  00:07:14.660
you can see that it is defined through the weight.
176

176

00:07:14.660  -->  00:07:19.660
So, a, v are biases in the system, so just constants,
177

177

00:07:19.830  -->  00:07:24.830
v and h are, that's the visible node that you're looking at,
178

178

00:07:25.420  -->  00:07:27.780
specifically you're calculating your equation,
179

179

00:07:27.780  -->  00:07:30.410
h is the hidden node that you're calculating.
180

180

00:07:30.410  -->  00:07:33.040
That's your visible node again, that's your hidden node,
181

181

00:07:33.040  -->  00:07:34.470
and that's the weight between the
182

182

00:07:34.470  -->  00:07:35.660
visible and the hidden node.
183

183

00:07:35.660  -->  00:07:38.660
And so, as you can see, well your biases are fixed
184

184

00:07:38.660  -->  00:07:39.950
and your weights are fixed here.
185

185

00:07:39.950  -->  00:07:42.710
And then the system knows that
186

186

00:07:42.710  -->  00:07:46.390
its energy function will be determined in this way.
187

187

00:07:46.390  -->  00:07:50.750
And then the probability of being in a certain state
188

188

00:07:50.750  -->  00:07:53.130
is given by, through the energy,
189

189

00:07:53.130  -->  00:07:54.560
just like in the Boltzmann distribution.
190

190

00:07:54.560  -->  00:07:58.700
Whereas zed, is the sum of all of the,
191

191

00:07:58.700  -->  00:08:01.430
of all of these values, for all of the possible states,
192

192

00:08:01.430  -->  00:08:03.240
just like in the Boltzmann distribution.
193

193

00:08:03.240  -->  00:08:06.200
And so, from that, we know that the probability
194

194

00:08:06.200  -->  00:08:08.520
of being in a certain state is
195

195

00:08:08.520  -->  00:08:10.830
inversely related with the energy of that state.
196

196

00:08:10.830  -->  00:08:11.940
And the system also knows that,
197

197

00:08:11.940  -->  00:08:13.680
so it's going to play by those rules,
198

198

00:08:13.680  -->  00:08:17.080
it's going to find the lowest energy state,
199

199

00:08:17.080  -->  00:08:18.840
just because of the way we set it up.
200

200

00:08:18.840  -->  00:08:21.220
So, that's a very high level
201

201

00:08:21.220  -->  00:08:23.160
overview of energy-based models,
202

202

00:08:23.160  -->  00:08:26.880
and why they're called Boltzmann machines,
203

203

00:08:26.880  -->  00:08:29.320
why this specific model is called a Boltzmann machine.
204

204

00:08:29.320  -->  00:08:34.320
And how energy plays in the work, in the functioning of a
205

205

00:08:35.410  -->  00:08:37.660
Boltzmann machine, it's very different.
206

206

00:08:37.660  -->  00:08:39.130
This concept is very different
207

207

00:08:39.130  -->  00:08:41.530
to what we had in just neural networks.
208

208

00:08:41.530  -->  00:08:45.390
And if you'd like to learn more, there's a great article,
209

209

00:08:45.390  -->  00:08:47.200
or it is a great paper actually not an article,
210

210

00:08:47.200  -->  00:08:50.580
by Yann LeCun, from 2006.
211

211

00:08:50.580  -->  00:08:53.190
It's called A Tutorial on Energy-Based Learning,
212

212

00:08:53.190  -->  00:08:54.520
and it's very long.
213

213

00:08:54.520  -->  00:08:56.500
I think it's like 50 pages long or something.
214

214

00:08:56.500  -->  00:08:59.430
So if you really want to dig into
215

215

00:08:59.430  -->  00:09:01.880
energy-based learning and energy-based models
216

216

00:09:01.880  -->  00:09:04.670
then this is probably the best place to start.
217

217

00:09:04.670  -->  00:09:08.520
If you don't have time to read an article,
218

218

00:09:08.520  -->  00:09:12.180
to read a paper, and you'd just like to get a bit more
219

219

00:09:12.180  -->  00:09:14.640
of a good feel for all of these things,
220

220

00:09:14.640  -->  00:09:17.593
all of these things like entropy and, you know...
221

221

00:09:18.620  -->  00:09:21.790
This concept of energy and entropy
222

222

00:09:21.790  -->  00:09:23.430
and Boltzmann distribution,
223

223

00:09:23.430  -->  00:09:25.410
they actually are very closely tied
224

224

00:09:25.410  -->  00:09:26.910
to how we live our lives.
225

225

00:09:26.910  -->  00:09:29.030
For instance, why does time travel forwards
226

226

00:09:29.030  -->  00:09:30.300
and not backwards?
227

227

00:09:30.300  -->  00:09:35.300
And you know, why if you mix two liquids together,
228

228

00:09:35.920  -->  00:09:38.270
if you mix two liquids together
229

229

00:09:38.270  -->  00:09:39.900
you can't then un-mix them?
230

230

00:09:39.900  -->  00:09:42.990
Why smoke goes out of a cigarette not back into a cigarette.
231

231

00:09:42.990  -->  00:09:44.810
Why you can remember the past
232

232

00:09:44.810  -->  00:09:45.950
and you can't remember the future.
233

233

00:09:45.950  -->  00:09:48.560
These kind of very philosophical questions,
234

234

00:09:48.560  -->  00:09:50.830
we're getting very close to that
235

235

00:09:50.830  -->  00:09:53.330
when we're talking about energy-based models
236

236

00:09:53.330  -->  00:09:54.440
and things like entropy,
237

237

00:09:54.440  -->  00:09:55.273
even though we didn't really
238

238

00:09:55.273  -->  00:09:57.630
mention entropy throughout this tutorial.
239

239

00:09:57.630  -->  00:10:01.240
But if you'd like to get into a bit more of that
240

240

00:10:01.240  -->  00:10:05.160
without having to read a paper and understand mathematics
241

241

00:10:05.160  -->  00:10:07.481
and all of these things that govern that,
242

242

00:10:07.481  -->  00:10:09.210
there's a great movie that I can recommend you.
243

243

00:10:09.210  -->  00:10:13.070
It's called Mr. Nobody, by Jaco Van Dormael,
244

244

00:10:13.070  -->  00:10:14.520
created in 2009.
245

245

00:10:14.520  -->  00:10:16.730
It's got Jared Leto, great movie,
246

246

00:10:16.730  -->  00:10:17.930
on all of these things.
247

247

00:10:17.930  -->  00:10:21.796
On entropy, on how time travels forwards
248

248

00:10:21.796  -->  00:10:22.930
and things like that.
249

249

00:10:22.930  -->  00:10:24.500
It was premiered at the
250

250

00:10:24.500  -->  00:10:27.550
66th Venice International Film Festival.
251

251

00:10:27.550  -->  00:10:29.270
So, if you're looking for a good movie,
252

252

00:10:29.270  -->  00:10:31.660
I would highly recommend checking this one out.
253

253

00:10:31.660  -->  00:10:34.030
Other than that, that's our energy-based models,
254

254

00:10:34.030  -->  00:10:36.950
and I look forward to seeing you next time.
255

255

00:10:36.950  -->  00:10:38.733
Until then, enjoy deep learning.
