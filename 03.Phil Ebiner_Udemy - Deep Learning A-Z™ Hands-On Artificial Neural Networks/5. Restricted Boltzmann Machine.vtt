<v Instructor>Hello and welcome back</v>
2

2

00:00:01.560  -->  00:00:03.950
to the course on deep learning.
3

3

00:00:03.950  -->  00:00:05.070
In today's tutorial we're going to talk
4

4

00:00:05.070  -->  00:00:07.030
about the restricted Boltzmann machine
5

5

00:00:07.030  -->  00:00:10.150
and we're going to see how it learns,
6

6

00:00:10.150  -->  00:00:13.150
and how it is applied in practice.
7

7

00:00:13.150  -->  00:00:15.810
Gonna be a very interesting tutorial, let's get started.
8

8

00:00:15.810  -->  00:00:18.210
So here we've got the standard Boltzmann machine
9

9

00:00:18.210  -->  00:00:20.890
or the full Boltzmann machine where as you remember,
10

10

00:00:20.890  -->  00:00:23.240
we've got all of these intra connections.
11

11

00:00:23.240  -->  00:00:25.864
Every single node connects to every single other node
12

12

00:00:25.864  -->  00:00:29.970
and while in theory this is a great model
13

13

00:00:29.970  -->  00:00:33.760
and it's probably you can solve lots of different problems,
14

14

00:00:33.760  -->  00:00:37.300
in practice it's very hard to implement in fact,
15

15

00:00:37.300  -->  00:00:40.150
at some point we'll run into a roadblock because we cannot,
16

16

00:00:40.150  -->  00:00:42.760
simply cannot compute a full Boltzmann machine
17

17

00:00:42.760  -->  00:00:45.510
and the reason for that is as you increase number of nodes,
18

18

00:00:45.510  -->  00:00:48.790
the number of connections between them grows exponentially.
19

19

00:00:48.790  -->  00:00:51.930
So therefore, a different type of architecture was proposed
20

20

00:00:51.930  -->  00:00:54.030
which is called the restricted Boltzmann machine
21

21

00:00:54.030  -->  00:00:55.720
and this is what it looks like.
22

22

00:00:55.720  -->  00:00:58.410
So here we've got exactly the same concept
23

23

00:00:58.410  -->  00:01:02.670
with the simple restriction that hidden nodes cannot connect
24

24

00:01:02.670  -->  00:01:05.290
to each other and visible nodes cannot connect
25

25

00:01:05.290  -->  00:01:06.123
to each other.
26

26

00:01:06.123  -->  00:01:07.950
Other than that, everything's the same.
27

27

00:01:07.950  -->  00:01:11.370
We've got connections which are undirected meaning
28

28

00:01:11.370  -->  00:01:13.940
that they happen in both ways both from visible nodes
29

29

00:01:13.940  -->  00:01:16.820
to hidden nodes and from hidden nodes to visible nodes.
30

30

00:01:16.820  -->  00:01:18.290
And that's the architecture
31

31

00:01:18.290  -->  00:01:19.780
of the restricted Boltzmann machine.
32

32

00:01:19.780  -->  00:01:23.920
And now we're going to talk about how it is,
33

33

00:01:23.920  -->  00:01:26.290
how it works, how it's trained and then how it's applied
34

34

00:01:26.290  -->  00:01:27.310
in practice.
35

35

00:01:27.310  -->  00:01:29.260
So let's get straight into it.
36

36

00:01:29.260  -->  00:01:31.840
We're going to look at an example with movies
37

37

00:01:31.840  -->  00:01:34.460
because you can use a restricted Boltzmann machine
38

38

00:01:34.460  -->  00:01:37.770
to build a recommender system and that's exactly
39

39

00:01:37.770  -->  00:01:38.603
what you're going to be doing
40

40

00:01:38.603  -->  00:01:40.530
in the practical tutorials we've had learned.
41

41

00:01:40.530  -->  00:01:43.300
And this is going to help us build
42

42

00:01:43.300  -->  00:01:44.500
an intuitive understanding
43

43

00:01:44.500  -->  00:01:46.580
of the restricted Boltzmann machine and also it's going
44

44

00:01:46.580  -->  00:01:48.490
to help you when you're walking
45

45

00:01:48.490  -->  00:01:50.840
through the practical tutorials.
46

46

00:01:50.840  -->  00:01:54.290
So let's say our restricted Boltzmann machine is going
47

47

00:01:54.290  -->  00:01:55.500
or our recommender system is going
48

48

00:01:55.500  -->  00:01:58.110
to be working on six movies.
49

49

00:01:58.110  -->  00:02:00.260
Of course, in reality, there's going to be lots
50

50

00:02:00.260  -->  00:02:01.500
and lots more movies as you'll see
51

51

00:02:01.500  -->  00:02:03.040
in the practical tutorials.
52

52

00:02:03.040  -->  00:02:06.870
There'll be many more movies but in our example,
53

53

00:02:06.870  -->  00:02:09.740
we're just going to work with six for simplicity's sake
54

54

00:02:09.740  -->  00:02:13.100
and the way it's going to work is that we're going to,
55

55

00:02:13.100  -->  00:02:14.540
well let's rewind a little bit.
56

56

00:02:14.540  -->  00:02:18.150
As you remember, a Boltzmann machine is a generative type
57

57

00:02:18.150  -->  00:02:21.600
of model so it always constantly generates
58

58

00:02:21.600  -->  00:02:23.900
or is capable of generating these states,
59

59

00:02:23.900  -->  00:02:25.840
these different states of our system
60

60

00:02:25.840  -->  00:02:30.100
and then in training through feeding it training data
61

61

00:02:30.100  -->  00:02:32.270
and through a process called contrastive divergence
62

62

00:02:32.270  -->  00:02:35.040
which we'll discuss further down in this section.
63

63

00:02:35.040  -->  00:02:38.170
We help the Boltzmann machine
64

64

00:02:38.170  -->  00:02:41.000
to become very,
65

65

00:02:41.000  -->  00:02:42.400
become a representation
66

66

00:02:42.400  -->  00:02:46.420
of our specific system rather being a recommender system
67

67

00:02:46.420  -->  00:02:50.290
for any kind of possible impossible movies or any kind
68

68

00:02:50.290  -->  00:02:52.590
of recommender possible impossible recommender system.
69

69

00:02:52.590  -->  00:02:56.680
We make it become more and more like the recommender system
70

70

00:02:56.680  -->  00:02:59.960
that is associated with our specific set of movies
71

71

00:02:59.960  -->  00:03:01.610
that we are feeding into this system
72

72

00:03:01.610  -->  00:03:03.813
and with our specific training data.
73

73

00:03:04.750  -->  00:03:06.180
And so through that process,
74

74

00:03:06.180  -->  00:03:07.870
what this restricted Boltzmann machine is going
75

75

00:03:07.870  -->  00:03:11.040
to learn is it's going to understand how
76

76

00:03:11.040  -->  00:03:14.090
to allocate its hidden nodes to certain features.
77

77

00:03:14.090  -->  00:03:16.040
And this process is very very similar
78

78

00:03:16.040  -->  00:03:19.300
to what we discussed in the convolutionary neural networks.
79

79

00:03:19.300  -->  00:03:22.061
So for example, through the training process,
80

80

00:03:22.061  -->  00:03:23.870
the restricted Boltzmann machine might identify
81

81

00:03:23.870  -->  00:03:28.000
that genres are, genres of movies are important features
82

82

00:03:28.000  -->  00:03:31.860
for instance, genre A, B, C, D and E and the important thing
83

83

00:03:31.860  -->  00:03:35.040
to understand here is that it doesn't know
84

84

00:03:35.040  -->  00:03:35.960
that these are genres,
85

85

00:03:35.960  -->  00:03:37.490
it's just identifying certain features.
86

86

00:03:37.490  -->  00:03:38.950
We'll talk about this just in a second.
87

87

00:03:38.950  -->  00:03:41.210
Let's just, to start off with,
88

88

00:03:41.210  -->  00:03:43.350
to get us more comfortable with this concept,
89

89

00:03:43.350  -->  00:03:45.930
well let's kind of make it obvious that it doesn't have
90

90

00:03:45.930  -->  00:03:46.770
to be genres, for example, it could identify
91

91

00:03:46.770  -->  00:03:51.770
that genre A and B are important for the recommender system
92

92

00:03:52.070  -->  00:03:56.460
but then other important features include an actor,
93

93

00:03:56.460  -->  00:03:59.880
maybe Kevin Costner, an award maybe an Oscar,
94

94

00:03:59.880  -->  00:04:02.580
a director, Robert Zemeckis.
95

95

00:04:02.580  -->  00:04:05.360
So, it will identify that these are important features
96

96

00:04:05.360  -->  00:04:07.600
and so what does that mean?
97

97

00:04:07.600  -->  00:04:08.433
Right?
98

98

00:04:08.433  -->  00:04:11.510
You're probably, right now the main question
99

99

00:04:11.510  -->  00:04:14.440
that you might have in your head right now is, what,
100

100

00:04:14.440  -->  00:04:16.610
what does that even mean when it's identified
101

101

00:04:16.610  -->  00:04:18.200
that a feature is important?
102

102

00:04:18.200  -->  00:04:20.840
Well let's go through this, during the training process,
103

103

00:04:20.840  -->  00:04:22.400
we're feeding in lots and lots of rows
104

104

00:04:22.400  -->  00:04:25.190
to the restricted Boltzmann machine and for example,
105

105

00:04:25.190  -->  00:04:27.270
these rows could look something like this
106

106

00:04:27.270  -->  00:04:30.260
where we've got movies as columns
107

107

00:04:30.260  -->  00:04:32.280
and then the users as rows.
108

108

00:04:32.280  -->  00:04:35.870
And here we've got the ratings or the feedback
109

109

00:04:35.870  -->  00:04:37.960
that each user has left for the movie
110

110

00:04:37.960  -->  00:04:39.290
whether they liked it, that's a one
111

111

00:04:39.290  -->  00:04:41.130
or they didn't like it, a zero
112

112

00:04:41.130  -->  00:04:43.860
and also the empty cells are totally fine as well
113

113

00:04:43.860  -->  00:04:46.820
because that just means that person hasn't watched
114

114

00:04:46.820  -->  00:04:47.790
that movie.
115

115

00:04:47.790  -->  00:04:51.350
And, through this process as we're feeding
116

116

00:04:51.350  -->  00:04:54.780
in this data to this restricted Boltzmann machine
117

117

00:04:54.780  -->  00:04:56.990
what it is able to do is it's able
118

118

00:04:56.990  -->  00:05:01.400
to understand better our system and it is better
119

119

00:05:01.400  -->  00:05:05.240
to adjust itself to be a better representation
120

120

00:05:05.240  -->  00:05:09.920
of our system, and understand and reflect better reflect all
121

121

00:05:09.920  -->  00:05:12.300
of the intra connectivity that is,
122

122

00:05:12.300  -->  00:05:15.440
that might be present here because ultimately,
123

123

00:05:15.440  -->  00:05:19.590
people have biases, people have preferences,
124

124

00:05:19.590  -->  00:05:22.860
people have tastes and that is what is reflected
125

125

00:05:22.860  -->  00:05:23.693
in the datas.
126

126

00:05:23.693  -->  00:05:26.670
If somebody liked Movie two and three
127

127

00:05:26.670  -->  00:05:28.560
and didn't like Movie one just means
128

128

00:05:28.560  -->  00:05:30.790
that that's what's their preferences.
129

129

00:05:30.790  -->  00:05:33.210
Somebody else might have liked movie you one
130

130

00:05:33.210  -->  00:05:35.180
and might have not liked Movie two
131

131

00:05:35.180  -->  00:05:36.610
and might have liked that Movie three.
132

132

00:05:36.610  -->  00:05:41.610
So basically the data is talking about the preferences
133

133

00:05:41.610  -->  00:05:45.500
of people, their tastes and their, how they prefer
134

134

00:05:45.500  -->  00:05:48.180
to view movies or how they're biased
135

135

00:05:48.180  -->  00:05:49.590
towards different movies and that's what
136

136

00:05:49.590  -->  00:05:52.460
the restricted Boltzmann machine is trying to explain.
137

137

00:05:52.460  -->  00:05:55.700
And for instance it can or not explaining,
138

138

00:05:55.700  -->  00:05:57.520
that's what it's trying to model.
139

139

00:05:57.520  -->  00:06:00.770
And for instance, it could pick up from our example here
140

140

00:06:00.770  -->  00:06:04.680
that Movies three, four and six have very,
141

141

00:06:04.680  -->  00:06:06.160
usually have similar ratings.
142

142

00:06:06.160  -->  00:06:08.330
Not all the time but very often when somebody likes
143

143

00:06:08.330  -->  00:06:10.630
Movie three, four, they will probably like Movie six
144

144

00:06:10.630  -->  00:06:12.620
or when somebody likes Movie six and four
145

145

00:06:12.620  -->  00:06:15.290
or six and three, they'll probably like Movie four.
146

146

00:06:15.290  -->  00:06:16.750
Six and three, they'll like Movie four
147

147

00:06:16.750  -->  00:06:18.260
or if they don't like Movie three and four,
148

148

00:06:18.260  -->  00:06:20.130
they're unlikely to like Movie six.
149

149

00:06:20.130  -->  00:06:21.970
It's not always, so here we've got an example
150

150

00:06:21.970  -->  00:06:25.470
of somebody didn't like Movie three, didn't like Movie four,
151

151

00:06:25.470  -->  00:06:30.470
they can be examples where it doesn't follow that rule
152

152

00:06:30.590  -->  00:06:33.600
but it's those are going to be kind of more
153

153

00:06:33.600  -->  00:06:37.500
of an exception from the rule rather than a common.
154

154

00:06:37.500  -->  00:06:39.430
And this is just a very simplified example.
155

155

00:06:39.430  -->  00:06:41.780
But then what the restricted Boltzmann machine would do,
156

156

00:06:41.780  -->  00:06:44.750
it would identify this in the training
157

157

00:06:44.750  -->  00:06:49.750
and it would assign a node to look out for that feature.
158

158

00:06:49.900  -->  00:06:51.840
And even without knowing what that feature is
159

159

00:06:51.840  -->  00:06:54.090
because as you can see all the input it's getting are ones
160

160

00:06:54.090  -->  00:06:57.270
and zeros, it's not getting the genre of the movies,
161

161

00:06:57.270  -->  00:06:58.790
it's not getting the list of actors,
162

162

00:06:58.790  -->  00:07:01.270
it's not getting the awards that the movie won, won.
163

163

00:07:01.270  -->  00:07:03.230
It's only getting just these ones and zeros.
164

164

00:07:03.230  -->  00:07:07.330
But even from these similarities, it can establish
165

165

00:07:07.330  -->  00:07:09.650
that there probably is some feature
166

166

00:07:09.650  -->  00:07:11.910
that these movies have in common
167

167

00:07:11.910  -->  00:07:13.820
that is making people like them.
168

168

00:07:13.820  -->  00:07:15.737
So people who like these movies like that,
169

169

00:07:15.737  -->  00:07:19.130
not just they like that movie, they like that feature
170

170

00:07:19.130  -->  00:07:22.710
and therefore any other movie with that feature, will,
171

171

00:07:22.710  -->  00:07:27.710
is more, is highly likely to be enjoyed by those people
172

172

00:07:27.920  -->  00:07:30.750
and in our understanding,
173

173

00:07:30.750  -->  00:07:32.760
as humans that feature might be genre.
174

174

00:07:32.760  -->  00:07:34.910
And this is again, this is very similar to what we had
175

175

00:07:34.910  -->  00:07:36.610
with convolutional neural networks.
176

176

00:07:36.610  -->  00:07:41.060
We might not have a descriptive term for that feature
177

177

00:07:41.060  -->  00:07:43.250
but just for simplicity's sake we're gonna say
178

178

00:07:43.250  -->  00:07:46.180
that it's Genre A or it could be Actor X
179

179

00:07:46.180  -->  00:07:47.560
and that way it'll be easier for us
180

180

00:07:47.560  -->  00:07:48.620
and to understand what's going on.
181

181

00:07:48.620  -->  00:07:50.710
But that's in essence what the restricted Boltzmann machine
182

182

00:07:50.710  -->  00:07:53.210
is doing through this input it is,
183

183

00:07:53.210  -->  00:07:55.940
and through the training process it is better
184

184

00:07:55.940  -->  00:07:59.650
and better understanding what's features these movies
185

185

00:07:59.650  -->  00:08:01.870
might have in common or if they are features
186

186

00:08:01.870  -->  00:08:03.060
that these movies might have in common
187

187

00:08:03.060  -->  00:08:05.150
and it's assigning its hidden nodes
188

188

00:08:05.150  -->  00:08:06.740
or the weights are being assigned in such a way
189

189

00:08:06.740  -->  00:08:10.380
that the hidden nodes are becoming reflective
190

190

00:08:10.380  -->  00:08:11.990
of those specific features.
191

191

00:08:11.990  -->  00:08:15.360
So that's how the training of the RBM happens.
192

192

00:08:15.360  -->  00:08:17.370
Now let's have a look at something more fun.
193

193

00:08:17.370  -->  00:08:20.160
Let's have a look at how this would play out in action.
194

194

00:08:20.160  -->  00:08:21.920
So now that we've trained up our machine,
195

195

00:08:21.920  -->  00:08:22.910
our restricted Boltzmann machine.
196

196

00:08:22.910  -->  00:08:25.970
We know that it is able to pick out these certain features
197

197

00:08:25.970  -->  00:08:30.320
and based on what it's previously seen about thousands
198

198

00:08:30.320  -->  00:08:33.440
of our users and their ratings and now we're going
199

199

00:08:33.440  -->  00:08:35.240
to look at specific features so let's say
200

200

00:08:35.240  -->  00:08:38.360
we're, it's picked out drama as a feature,
201

201

00:08:38.360  -->  00:08:41.540
action DiCaprio, Leonardo DiCaprio as the actor
202

202

00:08:41.540  -->  00:08:44.910
in a movie, Oscar, whether or not the movie has won an Oscar
203

203

00:08:44.910  -->  00:08:47.970
and Quentin Tarantino, whether or not he was a director
204

204

00:08:47.970  -->  00:08:49.220
of the movie.
205

205

00:08:49.220  -->  00:08:52.000
And again these are just for our benefit.
206

206

00:08:52.000  -->  00:08:54.370
In reality, the restricted Boltzmann machine has no idea
207

207

00:08:54.370  -->  00:08:57.713
whether (laughs) the director's name is Tarantino or not.
208

208

00:08:57.713  -->  00:08:59.430
It's just picking out a feature.
209

209

00:08:59.430  -->  00:09:01.570
This is our explanation of that feature
210

210

00:09:01.570  -->  00:09:04.980
for intuitive purposes and now we're going to look
211

211

00:09:04.980  -->  00:09:05.813
at a couple of movies.
212

212

00:09:05.813  -->  00:09:08.440
So the machine is trained up on lots and lots of rows
213

213

00:09:08.440  -->  00:09:10.300
and now we're going to input a new row
214

214

00:09:10.300  -->  00:09:12.490
into this restricted Boltzmann machine
215

215

00:09:12.490  -->  00:09:14.510
into this recommender system and we're going
216

216

00:09:14.510  -->  00:09:16.060
to see how it's going to go
217

217

00:09:16.060  -->  00:09:19.070
about giving us the prediction whether
218

218

00:09:19.070  -->  00:09:20.710
or not a person will like certain movies.
219

219

00:09:20.710  -->  00:09:21.580
This is the fun part.
220

220

00:09:21.580  -->  00:09:24.870
This is the actual application of the RBM.
221

221

00:09:24.870  -->  00:09:26.280
So let's start.
222

222

00:09:26.280  -->  00:09:31.280
We've got movies The Matrix, the Fight Club, Forrest Gump,
223

223

00:09:31.910  -->  00:09:35.620
Pulp Fiction, Titanic and The Departed.
224

224

00:09:35.620  -->  00:09:39.800
And I tried to pick movies which are quite commonly seen,
225

225

00:09:39.800  -->  00:09:42.210
so hopefully you've seen all of these or at least most
226

226

00:09:42.210  -->  00:09:45.020
of these movies, if not it doesn't really matter,
227

227

00:09:45.020  -->  00:09:47.190
it will still go through there.
228

228

00:09:47.190  -->  00:09:48.500
You'll still be able to follow along
229

229

00:09:48.500  -->  00:09:50.310
with the examples totally fine.
230

230

00:09:50.310  -->  00:09:52.460
The Oscar here represents whether
231

231

00:09:52.460  -->  00:09:54.610
or not a movie won an Oscar just so that we,
232

232

00:09:54.610  -->  00:09:56.340
there's no questions about that.
233

233

00:09:56.340  -->  00:09:57.700
And the Oscar here we're talking
234

234

00:09:57.700  -->  00:10:00.360
about is the Best Picture Oscar.
235

235

00:10:00.360  -->  00:10:03.150
So an Oscar is an Academy Award and there's lots
236

236

00:10:03.150  -->  00:10:06.330
of different Academy Awards, for instance, they can,
237

237

00:10:06.330  -->  00:10:10.100
that is pretty much synonymous terms is done with lots
238

238

00:10:10.100  -->  00:10:11.400
of different types of Oscars.
239

239

00:10:11.400  -->  00:10:13.760
You could get an Oscar for being the best actor,
240

240

00:10:13.760  -->  00:10:15.970
you could get an Oscar for the best sound effects
241

241

00:10:15.970  -->  00:10:19.460
in your movie or the best visual effects.
242

242

00:10:19.460  -->  00:10:21.700
Well, this specific Oscar we're talking about is
243

243

00:10:21.700  -->  00:10:24.900
the Best Picture and there's only one of those per year.
244

244

00:10:24.900  -->  00:10:27.170
Yeah, so these the movies that we're looking at.
245

245

00:10:27.170  -->  00:10:30.030
And now let's see this person that we're trying
246

246

00:10:30.030  -->  00:10:33.500
to make a recommendation for, what have they seen,
247

247

00:10:33.500  -->  00:10:34.790
what they haven't seen, what they've rated
248

248

00:10:34.790  -->  00:10:35.950
and how they've rated it.
249

249

00:10:35.950  -->  00:10:37.860
So they've seen The Matrix, they didn't like The matrix,
250

250

00:10:37.860  -->  00:10:40.500
they put a zero, so one is like, zero is dislike.
251

251

00:10:40.500  -->  00:10:42.530
Fight Club, they haven't seen the Fight Club.
252

252

00:10:42.530  -->  00:10:44.050
Forrest Gump, they've seen Forrest Gump
253

253

00:10:44.050  -->  00:10:45.360
and they like the movie.
254

254

00:10:45.360  -->  00:10:47.330
Pulp Fiction, they've seen Pulp Fiction
255

255

00:10:47.330  -->  00:10:48.740
but they didn't like the movie.
256

256

00:10:48.740  -->  00:10:51.310
Titanic they've seen and they've liked it
257

257

00:10:51.310  -->  00:10:54.040
and The Departed, they haven't seen that movie
258

258

00:10:54.040  -->  00:10:56.380
and now we want to make a recommendation
259

259

00:10:56.380  -->  00:10:58.930
for this person, will they like Fight Club or not?
260

260

00:10:58.930  -->  00:11:00.580
will they like The Departed or not?
261

261

00:11:00.580  -->  00:11:03.540
So how does the restricted Boltzmann machine go
262

262

00:11:03.540  -->  00:11:04.373
about this now.
263

263

00:11:04.373  -->  00:11:06.610
Now we're finally getting to the to the essence,
264

264

00:11:06.610  -->  00:11:08.250
we're finally getting to the applications,
265

265

00:11:08.250  -->  00:11:10.300
so this is gonna be, it's gonna be interesting.
266

266

00:11:10.300  -->  00:11:12.550
All right, so we're gonna go through this step by step
267

267

00:11:12.550  -->  00:11:15.290
and we're going to assess which of these nodes are going
268

268

00:11:15.290  -->  00:11:17.900
to activate for this specific user.
269

269

00:11:17.900  -->  00:11:19.380
So the Boltzmann machine is trained up,
270

270

00:11:19.380  -->  00:11:21.700
it already knows about features and similarities.
271

271

00:11:21.700  -->  00:11:24.240
Now it's going to try to assess which
272

272

00:11:24.240  -->  00:11:25.840
of these features are going to activate
273

273

00:11:25.840  -->  00:11:28.500
and think very, it could be useful to think
274

274

00:11:28.500  -->  00:11:33.360
of it as in the convolutional neural network analogy.
275

275

00:11:33.360  -->  00:11:35.600
In there, we would feed in a picture
276

276

00:11:35.600  -->  00:11:37.420
into our convolutional neural network
277

277

00:11:37.420  -->  00:11:40.630
and it would, certain features would highlight.
278

278

00:11:40.630  -->  00:11:43.660
Certain features would light up if they're present
279

279

00:11:43.660  -->  00:11:44.520
in that picture.
280

280

00:11:44.520  -->  00:11:46.570
Same thing here we're feeding in a row
281

281

00:11:46.570  -->  00:11:48.660
into our restricted Boltzmann machine
282

282

00:11:48.660  -->  00:11:50.190
and certain features are going
283

283

00:11:50.190  -->  00:11:54.310
to light up if they are present in this user's tastes
284

284

00:11:54.310  -->  00:11:57.110
and preferences and likes and biases.
285

285

00:11:57.110  -->  00:12:01.070
That's the kind of very intuitive,
286

286

00:12:01.070  -->  00:12:02.290
what's happening in the background,
287

287

00:12:02.290  -->  00:12:03.420
that's very intuitive explanation
288

288

00:12:03.420  -->  00:12:04.290
of what's happening in the background.
289

289

00:12:04.290  -->  00:12:06.030
So let's go through this, I'm gonna go
290

290

00:12:06.030  -->  00:12:07.700
with so we're gonna start with Drama.
291

291

00:12:07.700  -->  00:12:11.210
So in terms of Drama, which movies here are Drama?
292

292

00:12:11.210  -->  00:12:14.770
We know that Matrix is not Drama, Fight Club is not Drama,
293

293

00:12:14.770  -->  00:12:16.560
Forrest Gump is Drama.
294

294

00:12:16.560  -->  00:12:18.540
It's actually, I looked it up, it's actually comedy
295

295

00:12:18.540  -->  00:12:19.490
and then it's Drama.
296

296

00:12:19.490  -->  00:12:20.323
We don't have comedy here.
297

297

00:12:20.323  -->  00:12:22.550
So it's for all in our purposes it's Drama.
298

298

00:12:22.550  -->  00:12:24.440
Pulp Fiction is not Drama.
299

299

00:12:24.440  -->  00:12:27.460
Titanic is Drama and The Departed is Drama,
300

300

00:12:27.460  -->  00:12:29.960
but we don't have data for The Departed, right?
301

301

00:12:29.960  -->  00:12:34.440
So this Boltzmann machine can only learn from these two.
302

302

00:12:34.440  -->  00:12:37.090
Right, it can only say, all right so this person liked
303

303

00:12:37.090  -->  00:12:39.800
Forest Gump and this person liked the Titanic
304

304

00:12:39.800  -->  00:12:42.640
and based on that this node is gonna light up
305

305

00:12:42.640  -->  00:12:45.690
and it's going to, we're gonna light it up symbolically
306

306

00:12:45.690  -->  00:12:48.550
in green meaning that it's activated and it's,
307

307

00:12:48.550  -->  00:12:51.780
that means this person likes Drama, Drama movies.
308

308

00:12:51.780  -->  00:12:55.380
Next, Action and you can see that the Action movies we have
309

309

00:12:55.380  -->  00:12:58.480
here are The Matrix, Fight Club and Pulp Fiction
310

310

00:12:58.480  -->  00:12:59.313
and Departed.
311

311

00:12:59.313  -->  00:13:01.480
We have four Action movies but out of them
312

312

00:13:01.480  -->  00:13:03.610
we only have data for The Matrix and Pulp Fiction
313

313

00:13:03.610  -->  00:13:06.650
and both of these, this person didn't like.
314

314

00:13:06.650  -->  00:13:08.760
So it's gonna light up in red.
315

315

00:13:08.760  -->  00:13:11.990
DiCaprio. So out of all of these movies,
316

316

00:13:11.990  -->  00:13:15.310
Leonardo DiCaprio is present in Titanic and The Departed
317

317

00:13:15.310  -->  00:13:18.980
and based on this, just this one,
318

318

00:13:18.980  -->  00:13:23.720
that one movie the DiCaprio node is going to light up green.
319

319

00:13:23.720  -->  00:13:24.553
Oscar.
320

320

00:13:24.553  -->  00:13:26.490
So we've got three Oscar movies.
321

321

00:13:26.490  -->  00:13:28.660
We only have data for Forrest Gump and Titanic
322

322

00:13:28.660  -->  00:13:31.710
and based on those, that person liked both.
323

323

00:13:31.710  -->  00:13:34.150
The node is gonna just light up green.
324

324

00:13:34.150  -->  00:13:36.210
And finally Tarantino the only movie
325

325

00:13:36.210  -->  00:13:38.980
with Tarantino as the director here is Pulp Fiction,
326

326

00:13:38.980  -->  00:13:43.100
out of all of them and that person did not like Tarantino
327

327

00:13:43.100  -->  00:13:46.330
that movie and therefore this node is gonna light up red.
328

328

00:13:46.330  -->  00:13:49.020
So there we go, that's the first pass.
329

329

00:13:49.020  -->  00:13:52.100
Everything from our visible nodes goes into our hidden nodes
330

330

00:13:52.100  -->  00:13:54.610
and our hidden nodes now we know which ones are activated.
331

331

00:13:54.610  -->  00:13:57.080
And now, the backward pass happens.
332

332

00:13:57.080  -->  00:14:00.950
Now what happens is the Boltzmann machine is going to try
333

333

00:14:00.950  -->  00:14:03.840
to reconstruct our input.
334

334

00:14:03.840  -->  00:14:07.350
It's going to, I'm gonna show this by flashing them.
335

335

00:14:07.350  -->  00:14:09.920
So basically that's exactly what happens
336

336

00:14:09.920  -->  00:14:11.790
in the process whether you're training
337

337

00:14:11.790  -->  00:14:14.050
and we didn't mention this during a training process, and,
338

338

00:14:14.050  -->  00:14:15.910
but this is what happens during training as well.
339

339

00:14:15.910  -->  00:14:19.290
So during training and during this is
340

340

00:14:19.290  -->  00:14:21.010
and is in essence a test.
341

341

00:14:21.010  -->  00:14:24.380
What the Boltzmann machine does is it accept values
342

342

00:14:24.380  -->  00:14:25.860
into the hidden nodes and then it tries
343

343

00:14:25.860  -->  00:14:29.000
to reconstruct your inputs based
344

344

00:14:29.000  -->  00:14:30.860
on those hidden nodes if during training
345

345

00:14:30.860  -->  00:14:32.340
if the reconstruction is incorrect
346

346

00:14:32.340  -->  00:14:34.610
then everything is adjusted the weights are adjusted
347

347

00:14:34.610  -->  00:14:37.030
and then we reconstruct again and again again
348

348

00:14:37.030  -->  00:14:39.740
but now it's a test so we're actually
349

349

00:14:39.740  -->  00:14:42.920
inputting a certain row and we want to get our predictions.
350

350

00:14:42.920  -->  00:14:45.660
So basically, there is not gonna be any adjusting
351

351

00:14:45.660  -->  00:14:46.493
of weights.
352

352

00:14:46.493  -->  00:14:49.670
We're just going to see how the Boltzmann machine basically
353

353

00:14:49.670  -->  00:14:51.620
reconstructs these rows.
354

354

00:14:51.620  -->  00:14:53.500
And moreover, we're not going to care
355

355

00:14:53.500  -->  00:14:57.140
about the movies that we already have ratings for,
356

356

00:14:57.140  -->  00:14:58.450
that's what the training part
357

357

00:14:58.450  -->  00:15:00.070
of the Boltzmann machine is for.
358

358

00:15:00.070  -->  00:15:02.130
Here we're only going to care
359

359

00:15:02.130  -->  00:15:04.050
about the movies where we don't have ratings
360

360

00:15:04.050  -->  00:15:05.250
and we're gonna use the values
361

361

00:15:05.250  -->  00:15:07.070
that reconstructs as predictions.
362

362

00:15:07.070  -->  00:15:09.610
So once again from here Boltzmann machine is going
363

363

00:15:09.610  -->  00:15:12.810
to be reconstructing these input values based
364

364

00:15:12.810  -->  00:15:14.010
on what it's learned.
365

365

00:15:14.010  -->  00:15:15.680
And so let's let's go.
366

366

00:15:15.680  -->  00:15:18.450
How is it going to reconstruct Fight Club?
367

367

00:15:18.450  -->  00:15:21.440
Well, Fight Club is going to look at all of the nodes
368

368

00:15:21.440  -->  00:15:24.660
and find out based on what it learned
369

369

00:15:24.660  -->  00:15:26.320
from the training it's going to really know
370

370

00:15:26.320  -->  00:15:28.260
which nodes actually connect to Fight Club.
371

371

00:15:28.260  -->  00:15:29.240
Is it a Drama movie?
372

372

00:15:29.240  -->  00:15:30.160
No, it's not.
373

373

00:15:30.160  -->  00:15:31.070
Is it an Action movie?
374

374

00:15:31.070  -->  00:15:32.670
Yes, it is.
375

375

00:15:32.670  -->  00:15:33.890
So that's not always going to light up.
376

376

00:15:33.890  -->  00:15:35.350
Is it, does it have DiCaprio in it?
377

377

00:15:35.350  -->  00:15:36.450
No, it doesn't.
378

378

00:15:36.450  -->  00:15:37.580
Did this movie win an Oscar?
379

379

00:15:37.580  -->  00:15:38.440
It hasn't.
380

380

00:15:38.440  -->  00:15:41.610
And is Tarantino director of this movie?
381

381

00:15:41.610  -->  00:15:42.670
No, he's not.
382

382

00:15:42.670  -->  00:15:47.340
That's in our understanding because we know these things.
383

383

00:15:47.340  -->  00:15:49.220
In the Boltzmann machine's understanding it will be like,
384

384

00:15:49.220  -->  00:15:53.040
does this, is this node connected to this node?
385

385

00:15:53.040  -->  00:15:53.873
No.
386

386

00:15:53.873  -->  00:15:54.860
Is this node connected to this node?
387

387

00:15:54.860  -->  00:15:55.693
Yes.
388

388

00:15:55.693  -->  00:15:56.526
Is this node connected to this node?
389

389

00:15:56.526  -->  00:15:57.870
No.
This node to this no.
390

390

00:15:57.870  -->  00:15:58.703
This to this, no.
391

391

00:15:58.703  -->  00:16:00.240
So it wouldn't know these words
392

392

00:16:00.240  -->  00:16:01.630
but it would know these connections,
393

393

00:16:01.630  -->  00:16:03.490
it would know these associations based
394

394

00:16:03.490  -->  00:16:07.040
on the weights that it had determined during training
395

395

00:16:07.040  -->  00:16:08.980
and based on this one connection,
396

396

00:16:08.980  -->  00:16:10.750
we know this one lit up in red
397

397

00:16:10.750  -->  00:16:12.620
and therefore Fight Club is going
398

398

00:16:12.620  -->  00:16:14.860
to be a movie that this person is not going to like.
399

399

00:16:14.860  -->  00:16:15.720
Then next one.
400

400

00:16:15.720  -->  00:16:18.260
So now we're going to talk about The Departed.
401

401

00:16:18.260  -->  00:16:20.030
So the recommendation here is no.
402

402

00:16:20.030  -->  00:16:21.450
Now let's talk about The Departed.
403

403

00:16:21.450  -->  00:16:23.160
Again it's gonna go through its nodes,
404

404

00:16:23.160  -->  00:16:24.610
it's gonna know the connections.
405

405

00:16:24.610  -->  00:16:25.443
Right?
406

406

00:16:25.443  -->  00:16:28.530
Just by the weights from which should had established
407

407

00:16:28.530  -->  00:16:31.480
during training is going to know these connections
408

408

00:16:31.480  -->  00:16:35.660
and it will know here that The Departed is connected
409

409

00:16:35.660  -->  00:16:37.497
to this node, is connected to these nodes,
410

410

00:16:37.497  -->  00:16:39.206
connected to this node, connected this node,
411

411

00:16:39.206  -->  00:16:40.360
it's not connected to this node.
412

412

00:16:40.360  -->  00:16:42.950
The weight here is low or very insignificant
413

413

00:16:42.950  -->  00:16:46.850
and in our terms in human language why is that?
414

414

00:16:46.850  -->  00:16:49.180
Well because this node is responsible for Drama movies,
415

415

00:16:49.180  -->  00:16:50.013
it's a Drama movie.
416

416

00:16:50.013  -->  00:16:51.860
This node is responsible for Action movies,
417

417

00:16:51.860  -->  00:16:52.930
it's an Action movie.
418

418

00:16:52.930  -->  00:16:55.300
This node is responsible for DiCaprio movies,
419

419

00:16:55.300  -->  00:16:56.750
it does have DiCaprio in it.
420

420

00:16:56.750  -->  00:16:59.790
This movie is now is responsible for Oscar movies,
421

421

00:16:59.790  -->  00:17:02.970
it does have, it did have an Oscar, did win an Oscar
422

422

00:17:02.970  -->  00:17:04.470
and therefore based on this,
423

423

00:17:04.470  -->  00:17:07.460
we can see this node votes yes, yes, yes,
424

424

00:17:07.460  -->  00:17:11.560
this no, votes no so the answer in simplistic terms is,
425

425

00:17:11.560  -->  00:17:15.240
yes, you are going to most likely enjoy that movie
426

426

00:17:15.240  -->  00:17:17.610
or that user is going to enjoy that movie.
427

427

00:17:17.610  -->  00:17:18.800
So there we go, that's how the
428

428

00:17:18.800  -->  00:17:20.390
restricted Boltzmann machine works.
429

429

00:17:20.390  -->  00:17:22.950
I hope you enjoyed this breakdown of the training
430

430

00:17:22.950  -->  00:17:25.560
and the application of the RBM
431

431

00:17:25.560  -->  00:17:27.530
and I can't wait to see you in the next tutorial.
432

432

00:17:27.530  -->  00:17:29.313
Until then, enjoy deep learning.
