00:00:00.090  -->  00:00:02.760
<v Instructor>Hello and welcome to this Python tutorial.</v>
2

2

00:00:02.760  -->  00:00:03.930
So, in the previous tutorials,
3

3

00:00:03.930  -->  00:00:06.050
we pre-processed our data here,
4

4

00:00:06.050  -->  00:00:08.610
then we fitted Logistic Regression to the Training set
5

5

00:00:08.610  -->  00:00:12.350
and now today we're going to predict the test set results.
6

6

00:00:12.350  -->  00:00:13.740
So, it's gonna be very fast,
7

7

00:00:13.740  -->  00:00:16.670
it's going to take us one line, so let's write it.
8

8

00:00:16.670  -->  00:00:18.643
We're going to introduce a new variable here
9

9

00:00:18.643  -->  00:00:20.210
that we're gonna call y_pred
10

10

00:00:22.540  -->  00:00:26.070
because y_pred is going to be the vector of predictions.
11

11

00:00:26.070  -->  00:00:28.130
That means that it's going to be the vector
12

12

00:00:28.130  -->  00:00:30.560
that gives the prediction of each
13

13

00:00:30.560  -->  00:00:32.263
of the test set observation.
14

14

00:00:33.350  -->  00:00:34.880
So, let's compute this vector.
15

15

00:00:34.880  -->  00:00:38.560
Simply to compute it, we're gonna take our classifier
16

16

00:00:38.560  -->  00:00:41.580
that we created in the previous tutorial,
17

17

00:00:41.580  -->  00:00:44.280
the classifier that was fitted to the training set
18

18

00:00:45.350  -->  00:00:47.462
and here we're gonna use another method
19

19

00:00:47.462  -->  00:00:49.880
of the LogisticRegression class
20

20

00:00:49.880  -->  00:00:51.420
because the classifier is an object
21

21

00:00:51.420  -->  00:00:53.260
of the LogisticRegression class.
22

22

00:00:53.260  -->  00:00:57.550
And this method is going to be this time the predict method.
23

23

00:00:57.550  -->  00:00:59.770
Very simply here it is.
24

24

00:00:59.770  -->  00:01:00.603
Predict.
25

25

00:01:01.560  -->  00:01:05.180
And in parenthesis, we have to input an argument.
26

26

00:01:05.180  -->  00:01:08.280
In your opinion, what is this argument going to be?
27

27

00:01:08.280  -->  00:01:10.270
We are going to predict the results
28

28

00:01:10.270  -->  00:01:12.180
of the X_test observation,
29

29

00:01:12.180  -->  00:01:14.493
so here we have to input X_test.
30

30

00:01:16.050  -->  00:01:19.820
Okay and it's ready, so let's select this line,
31

31

00:01:19.820  -->  00:01:22.490
press Command and Control + Enter to execute
32

32

00:01:22.490  -->  00:01:23.740
and here we go.
33

33

00:01:23.740  -->  00:01:26.560
Our vector of predictions y_pred is ready.
34

34

00:01:26.560  -->  00:01:28.100
Let's have a look.
35

35

00:01:28.100  -->  00:01:30.950
So, y_pred is just here
36

36

00:01:30.950  -->  00:01:32.530
and if we open our test set,
37

37

00:01:32.530  -->  00:01:34.380
you're gonna understand what it does.
38

38

00:01:35.410  -->  00:01:38.920
So, remember, this was scaled so we cannot interpret this
39

39

00:01:38.920  -->  00:01:42.700
but here was the Age column and here was the Salary column.
40

40

00:01:42.700  -->  00:01:45.490
So, let's take, for example, the first user.
41

41

00:01:45.490  -->  00:01:46.930
Here we have zero which means
42

42

00:01:46.930  -->  00:01:50.230
that our LogisticRegression classifier predicted
43

43

00:01:50.230  -->  00:01:52.880
that this user didn't buy the SUV car.
44

44

00:01:52.880  -->  00:01:55.990
However, if we look at the seventh observation here,
45

45

00:01:55.990  -->  00:01:57.990
so the seventh user,
46

46

00:01:57.990  -->  00:01:59.500
here we have a one which means
47

47

00:01:59.500  -->  00:02:02.450
that the LogisticRegression classifier predicted
48

48

00:02:02.450  -->  00:02:04.993
that this user bought the SUV car.
49

49

00:02:06.850  -->  00:02:08.850
Let's close this and this
50

50

00:02:08.850  -->  00:02:09.950
and that's it for this tutorial.
51

51

00:02:09.950  -->  00:02:12.180
That's how you predict the test set results
52

52

00:02:12.180  -->  00:02:14.360
with our LogisticRegression classifier.
53

53

00:02:14.360  -->  00:02:17.790
In the next tutorial, we will be evaluating the performance
54

54

00:02:17.790  -->  00:02:19.800
of this LogisticRegression classifier
55

55

00:02:19.800  -->  00:02:21.560
using the confusion matrix,
56

56

00:02:21.560  -->  00:02:24.560
so we're gonna see the number of correct predictions
57

57

00:02:24.560  -->  00:02:26.600
and the number of incorrect predictions
58

58

00:02:26.600  -->  00:02:30.510
that our LogisticRegression classifier made.
59

59

00:02:30.510  -->  00:02:32.470
So, I look forward to seeing you in the next tutorial
60

60

00:02:32.470  -->  00:02:34.553
and until then, enjoy machine learning.
