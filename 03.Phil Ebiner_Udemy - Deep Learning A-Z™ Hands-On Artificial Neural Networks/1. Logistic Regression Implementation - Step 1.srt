00:00:00,090  -->  00:00:02,850
<v Tutor>Hello and welcome to this Python tutorial.</v>
2

2

00:00:02,850  -->  00:00:05,130
In the following tutorials we will be implementing
3

3

00:00:05,130  -->  00:00:07,320
Logistic Regression on Python,
4

4

00:00:07,320  -->  00:00:09,800
and I can't wait to show you the final result,
5

5

00:00:09,800  -->  00:00:11,533
to show you how Logistic Regression
6

6

00:00:11,533  -->  00:00:14,070
manages to separate some categories
7

7

00:00:14,070  -->  00:00:16,380
and predict binary outcome.
8

8

00:00:16,380  -->  00:00:18,450
So let's start making the model right now.
9

9

00:00:18,450  -->  00:00:21,000
The real first step of making a machine learning model
10

10

00:00:21,000  -->  00:00:23,470
is to pre-process the data
11

11

00:00:23,470  -->  00:00:25,270
and to do this of course we're gonna use
12

12

00:00:25,270  -->  00:00:26,800
the data pre-processing template
13

13

00:00:26,800  -->  00:00:28,640
we've been preparing in Part one.
14

14

00:00:28,640  -->  00:00:30,920
So we're gonna copy all this
15

15

00:00:30,920  -->  00:00:33,870
Copy, and paste it here.
16

16

00:00:33,870  -->  00:00:36,350
So now we just need to change a few things.
17

17

00:00:36,350  -->  00:00:39,344
First let's import the three essential Libraries.
18

18

00:00:39,344  -->  00:00:40,820
Here we go.
19

19

00:00:40,820  -->  00:00:43,630
And then here we need to change the name of the data set.
20

20

00:00:43,630  -->  00:00:48,630
Here it's of cause Social underscore Network underscore Ads.
21

21

00:00:50,970  -->  00:00:51,957
And now let's select this line
22

22

00:00:51,957  -->  00:00:54,540
to have a look at our data set.
23

23

00:00:54,540  -->  00:00:57,020
So execute, perfect.
24

24

00:00:57,020  -->  00:00:59,150
Now let's go to Variable Explorer
25

25

00:00:59,150  -->  00:01:00,500
to have a look at our data set,
26

26

00:01:00,500  -->  00:01:02,520
by double clicking on it here.
27

27

00:01:02,520  -->  00:01:04,500
And here's the data set.
28

28

00:01:04,500  -->  00:01:05,880
Okay so just a quick reminder,
29

29

00:01:05,880  -->  00:01:07,790
this data set contains information
30

30

00:01:07,790  -->  00:01:10,140
of users in its Social Network.
31

31

00:01:10,140  -->  00:01:13,590
So those informations are the User ID, the Gender, the Age
32

32

00:01:13,590  -->  00:01:15,600
and the Estimated Salary.
33

33

00:01:15,600  -->  00:01:18,260
And this Social Network has several business clients
34

34

00:01:18,260  -->  00:01:21,390
which can put their Ads on this Social Network
35

35

00:01:21,390  -->  00:01:23,710
and one of their clients is a car company,
36

36

00:01:23,710  -->  00:01:27,670
who has just launched their brand new luxury SUV
37

37

00:01:27,670  -->  00:01:29,770
for a ridiculous price.
38

38

00:01:29,770  -->  00:01:32,110
And we're trying to see which of these Users
39

39

00:01:32,110  -->  00:01:36,880
of the Social Network are going to buy this brand new SUV.
40

40

00:01:36,880  -->  00:01:40,040
And so the last column here, tells if yes or no
41

41

00:01:40,040  -->  00:01:41,963
the User bought this SUV.
42

42

00:01:42,920  -->  00:01:45,530
We are gonna build a model that is going to predict
43

43

00:01:45,530  -->  00:01:49,020
if a User is going to buy or not the SUV,
44

44

00:01:49,020  -->  00:01:51,210
based on two variables which are gonna be
45

45

00:01:51,210  -->  00:01:53,550
the Age and the Estimated Salary.
46

46

00:01:53,550  -->  00:01:56,900
So our Matrix of Features only going to be these two columns
47

47

00:01:56,900  -->  00:01:59,000
We wanna find some correlations
48

48

00:01:59,000  -->  00:02:02,180
between the Age and the Estimated Salary of a User.
49

49

00:02:02,180  -->  00:02:06,110
And his decision to purchase, yes or no, the SUV.
50

50

00:02:06,110  -->  00:02:09,170
Okay, so what are the indexes?
51

51

00:02:09,170  -->  00:02:13,530
This is Index zero, Index one, Index two and Index three.
52

52

00:02:13,530  -->  00:02:17,000
So here we're gonna put our indexes.
53

53

00:02:17,000  -->  00:02:19,710
We're gonna put our two Indexes in brackets.
54

54

00:02:19,710  -->  00:02:22,430
So it's two, comma and three.
55

55

00:02:22,430  -->  00:02:26,270
So that's the two Indexes of the columns
56

56

00:02:26,270  -->  00:02:29,730
that we want to include in our Matrix of Features.
57

57

00:02:29,730  -->  00:02:31,750
Okay, and what about Y?
58

58

00:02:31,750  -->  00:02:32,880
Let's see Y.
59

59

00:02:32,880  -->  00:02:36,000
Okay so this was Index two, Index three and Index four.
60

60

00:02:36,000  -->  00:02:40,080
So here Y is gonna take Index four.
61

61

00:02:40,080  -->  00:02:41,650
Alright, and now we're ready.
62

62

00:02:41,650  -->  00:02:45,180
Let's check if everything is okay, let's select this.
63

63

00:02:45,180  -->  00:02:47,940
Command or Control plus Enter to execute.
64

64

00:02:47,940  -->  00:02:52,680
And here we go, X and Y appear here, so let's look at them.
65

65

00:02:52,680  -->  00:02:55,670
X, okay this is clearly the Age here
66

66

00:02:55,670  -->  00:02:57,270
and the Estimated Salary
67

67

00:02:57,270  -->  00:03:01,430
for all of our four hundred observations, perfect.
68

68

00:03:01,430  -->  00:03:03,653
Okay, and Y.
69

69

00:03:04,590  -->  00:03:06,970
Okay perfect Y is the Purchase column.
70

70

00:03:06,970  -->  00:03:10,170
Zero means no the User didn't buy the car, and one means yes
71

71

00:03:11,400  -->  00:03:13,880
Alright now let's split the data set
72

72

00:03:13,880  -->  00:03:16,080
into the Training set and the Test set.
73

73

00:03:16,080  -->  00:03:18,850
So which Test side would you like to choose?
74

74

00:03:18,850  -->  00:03:22,220
We have four hundred observations, so a good Test size
75

75

00:03:22,220  -->  00:03:24,610
would be to have three hundred observations
76

76

00:03:24,610  -->  00:03:26,820
in the Training set and a hundred observation
77

77

00:03:26,820  -->  00:03:29,020
in the Test set, is that cool?
78

78

00:03:29,020  -->  00:03:31,260
Okay so let's do this, that means we wanna take
79

79

00:03:31,260  -->  00:03:34,883
all Point twenty five, that is a hundred observations.
80

80

00:03:35,730  -->  00:03:40,730
Let's select this, Command or Control plus Enter to execute.
81

81

00:03:40,920  -->  00:03:44,690
Alright, so we have now our X Train, X Test,
82

82

00:03:44,690  -->  00:03:45,920
Y Train and Y Test,
83

83

00:03:45,920  -->  00:03:48,340
and you can see that we have three hundred observation
84

84

00:03:48,340  -->  00:03:50,920
in the Training set, here.
85

85

00:03:50,920  -->  00:03:53,770
And a hundred observation in the Test set.
86

86

00:03:53,770  -->  00:03:57,200
Okay great, and now do we need to apply Feature Scaling?
87

87

00:03:57,200  -->  00:03:58,510
Well yes we're gonna do it
88

88

00:03:58,510  -->  00:04:00,140
because we want accurate prediction,
89

89

00:04:00,140  -->  00:04:04,130
we want to predict which Users are going to buy the SUV,
90

90

00:04:04,130  -->  00:04:08,080
to, you know, target these Users as well as possible.
91

91

00:04:08,080  -->  00:04:11,963
So I'm gonna remove that multi-line column here.
92

92

00:04:15,720  -->  00:04:16,990
And I think we're fine.
93

93

00:04:16,990  -->  00:04:21,990
X Train and X Test are ready to be transformed, to be scaled
94

94

00:04:22,250  -->  00:04:23,663
so let's select this.
95

95

00:04:24,740  -->  00:04:26,790
Command or Control plus Enter to execute.
96

96

00:04:27,810  -->  00:04:30,430
Okay perfect, now let's look at our Training set
97

97

00:04:30,430  -->  00:04:31,860
and Test set.
98

98

00:04:31,860  -->  00:04:35,420
So as you can see the X Train is well scaled
99

99

00:04:35,420  -->  00:04:37,240
and, okay so that's for--, okay
100

100

00:04:37,240  -->  00:04:39,130
so Y Train wasn't scaled obviously
101

101

00:04:39,130  -->  00:04:42,180
because this is the category called Dependent variable
102

102

00:04:42,180  -->  00:04:45,470
and X Test scaled based on the same scale because you know,
103

103

00:04:45,470  -->  00:04:49,267
we fitted the SCX Standard Scaler Object
104

104

00:04:49,267  -->  00:04:51,510
to our Matrix of Features X Trend
105

105

00:04:51,510  -->  00:04:54,280
and we used the same object on X Test.
106

106

00:04:54,280  -->  00:04:58,040
So this means that it's scaled on the same basis.
107

107

00:04:58,040  -->  00:04:59,090
Okay, NY (inaudible).
108

108

00:05:01,190  -->  00:05:04,459
Great so we're ready, we pre-processed our data correctly
109

109

00:05:04,459  -->  00:05:07,930
and now we are ready to build our Logistic Regression Model.
110

110

00:05:07,930  -->  00:05:10,110
I can't wait to show you the results.
111

111

00:05:10,110  -->  00:05:13,450
Your intuition is gonna get even more shaped
112

112

00:05:13,450  -->  00:05:14,540
by looking at the results
113

113

00:05:14,540  -->  00:05:16,510
because everything is going to be visual.
114

114

00:05:16,510  -->  00:05:18,980
I can't wait to se you in the next tutorial to start.
115

115

00:05:18,980  -->  00:05:20,873
Until then, enjoy mission learning.
