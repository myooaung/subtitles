00:00:00.120  -->  00:00:01.490
<v Narrator>Hi guys this is Adlon,</v>
2

2

00:00:01.490  -->  00:00:03.230
the second instructor of this course.
3

3

00:00:03.230  -->  00:00:05.120
I'm super excited to have you on board,
4

4

00:00:05.120  -->  00:00:08.410
and today we're gonna start with the Machine Learning basics
5

5

00:00:08.410  -->  00:00:11.320
and especially how to get started in Python.
6

6

00:00:11.320  -->  00:00:14.170
So this is where you start in Python.
7

7

00:00:14.170  -->  00:00:16.740
You have this page when you open Anaconda,
8

8

00:00:16.740  -->  00:00:19.097
and as you understood the IDE that we're gonna use
9

9

00:00:19.097  -->  00:00:22.574
to build our deep learning models is going to be spider.
10

10

00:00:22.574  -->  00:00:25.910
This is an excellent IDE because this is kind of a studio,
11

11

00:00:25.910  -->  00:00:27.560
with a lot of practical tools,
12

12

00:00:27.560  -->  00:00:29.740
so we will definitely feel very comfortable
13

13

00:00:29.740  -->  00:00:32.730
and efficient when creating our deep learning models.
14

14

00:00:32.730  -->  00:00:36.120
So the first thing we need to do is launch spider
15

15

00:00:36.120  -->  00:00:38.500
and we will get to the following page.
16

16

00:00:38.500  -->  00:00:40.340
Here we go, that is spider.
17

17

00:00:40.340  -->  00:00:42.210
It contains three windows.
18

18

00:00:42.210  -->  00:00:45.020
This is the editor where we will type our code,
19

19

00:00:45.020  -->  00:00:47.820
then this is the console where our code will be executed,
20

20

00:00:47.820  -->  00:00:51.500
and this is another window that contains three panes,
21

21

00:00:51.500  -->  00:00:54.400
File Explorer, Variable explorer and Help.
22

22

00:00:54.400  -->  00:00:55.910
So file explorer is where
23

23

00:00:55.910  -->  00:00:57.770
we will choose our working directory,
24

24

00:00:57.770  -->  00:00:59.400
I will explain that in a second.
25

25

00:00:59.400  -->  00:01:02.080
Then variable explorer is what will contain
26

26

00:01:02.080  -->  00:01:04.070
all the variables we will be creating
27

27

00:01:04.070  -->  00:01:06.100
when making our deep learning models.
28

28

00:01:06.100  -->  00:01:08.388
And help is another window that gives you some help
29

29

00:01:08.388  -->  00:01:11.360
about the different functions to different objects
30

30

00:01:11.360  -->  00:01:14.420
that we'll use to build our deep learning models.
31

31

00:01:14.420  -->  00:01:15.910
If you don't have these panes right now,
32

32

00:01:15.910  -->  00:01:18.566
you just need to go to view and then panes
33

33

00:01:18.566  -->  00:01:21.890
and then you select the three panes file explorer,
34

34

00:01:21.890  -->  00:01:24.160
help and variable explorer.
35

35

00:01:24.160  -->  00:01:27.060
All right so almost ready to get started.
36

36

00:01:27.060  -->  00:01:29.130
When you open anaconda for the first time,
37

37

00:01:29.130  -->  00:01:32.220
you get this temp.py file.
38

38

00:01:32.220  -->  00:01:33.740
This is not the python file
39

39

00:01:33.740  -->  00:01:35.720
you should use to build your model.
40

40

00:01:35.720  -->  00:01:38.769
So we will just go to file to create a new file,
41

41

00:01:38.769  -->  00:01:42.563
a new python file and we're gonna close the temp.py file.
42

42

00:01:43.470  -->  00:01:45.860
Okay, then we can remove all this.
43

43

00:01:45.860  -->  00:01:47.120
We don't need this.
44

44

00:01:47.120  -->  00:01:49.547
And now we're gonna save this python file,
45

45

00:01:49.547  -->  00:01:52.920
into our deep learning A to Z folder.
46

46

00:01:52.920  -->  00:01:54.650
So in the resources of this tutorial,
47

47

00:01:54.650  -->  00:01:57.560
you have the deep learning A to Z template folder,
48

48

00:01:57.560  -->  00:01:59.250
so feel free to download it
49

49

00:01:59.250  -->  00:02:01.660
and put it wherever you want on your machine.
50

50

00:02:01.660  -->  00:02:03.500
Right now it is on my desktop.
51

51

00:02:03.500  -->  00:02:06.323
So let's open this folder, here we go.
52

52

00:02:06.323  -->  00:02:09.450
And in this folder we have three subfolders,
53

53

00:02:09.450  -->  00:02:11.030
get the machine learning basics,
54

54

00:02:11.030  -->  00:02:13.170
volume one about supervised deep learning
55

55

00:02:13.170  -->  00:02:15.436
and volume two about unsupervised deep learning.
56

56

00:02:15.436  -->  00:02:17.690
So right now we are at the section
57

57

00:02:17.690  -->  00:02:19.220
get the machine learning basics.
58

58

00:02:19.220  -->  00:02:22.900
So let's go inside and inside you will find two subfolders,
59

59

00:02:22.900  -->  00:02:26.180
data preprocessing template and classification template.
60

60

00:02:26.180  -->  00:02:29.390
Indeed in this get the machine learning basics section,
61

61

00:02:29.390  -->  00:02:30.499
we will build two templates,
62

62

00:02:30.499  -->  00:02:33.470
that will be very useful for our deep learning models.
63

63

00:02:33.470  -->  00:02:36.150
The first one is a data preprocessing template
64

64

00:02:36.150  -->  00:02:37.690
which is essential in machine learning
65

65

00:02:37.690  -->  00:02:39.040
and deep learning in general.
66

66

00:02:39.040  -->  00:02:40.560
So that our machine learning models
67

67

00:02:40.560  -->  00:02:42.530
can learn in the best conditions
68

68

00:02:42.530  -->  00:02:44.432
and the classification template that contains
69

69

00:02:44.432  -->  00:02:48.090
a lot of practical tools for our machine learning models.
70

70

00:02:48.090  -->  00:02:51.410
So we're gonna start with the data preprocessing template.
71

71

00:02:51.410  -->  00:02:53.780
And this is in this folder that we want to save
72

72

00:02:53.780  -->  00:02:57.330
our first Python file and that is for a specific reason.
73

73

00:02:57.330  -->  00:03:00.040
It's because this folder contains the data set
74

74

00:03:00.040  -->  00:03:01.600
with which we will be working
75

75

00:03:01.600  -->  00:03:03.700
to make this data preprocessing template .
76

76

00:03:03.700  -->  00:03:05.350
So the first thing you have to know,
77

77

00:03:05.350  -->  00:03:07.990
is that you should save your python file
78

78

00:03:07.990  -->  00:03:11.050
in the same folder that contains the data set.
79

79

00:03:11.050  -->  00:03:13.570
So let's give a name to this python file.
80

80

00:03:13.570  -->  00:03:16.757
I'm gonna call it data_preprocessing_template.
81

81

00:03:19.740  -->  00:03:21.881
All right and then you can click on save,
82

82

00:03:21.881  -->  00:03:24.203
and this will save your python file,
83

83

00:03:24.203  -->  00:03:26.390
and now we're ready to start.
84

84

00:03:26.390  -->  00:03:28.340
So let's give a title to this file.
85

85

00:03:28.340  -->  00:03:29.620
I'm pressing the hash key here
86

86

00:03:29.620  -->  00:03:33.423
to introduce a new comment data preprocessing.
87

87

00:03:34.650  -->  00:03:38.240
Here we go and now what is the first thing we have to do?
88

88

00:03:38.240  -->  00:03:39.370
Well the first step,
89

89

00:03:39.370  -->  00:03:42.230
is to set the right folder as working directory.
90

90

00:03:42.230  -->  00:03:43.550
And as I just explained,
91

91

00:03:43.550  -->  00:03:46.660
this folder is the folder that contains the data set
92

92

00:03:46.660  -->  00:03:49.740
with which we're gonna make our machine learning models.
93

93

00:03:49.740  -->  00:03:52.170
So how to set this folder as working directory?
94

94

00:03:52.170  -->  00:03:53.050
Well that's very simple.
95

95

00:03:53.050  -->  00:03:55.230
We need to go to file explorer,
96

96

00:03:55.230  -->  00:03:57.610
then right now I'm on my desktop,
97

97

00:03:57.610  -->  00:03:59.900
this is the deep learning A to Z folder,
98

98

00:03:59.900  -->  00:04:02.250
the folder of the course so we click on it.
99

99

00:04:02.250  -->  00:04:03.510
And now we need to find the folder
100

100

00:04:03.510  -->  00:04:05.210
that contains the data set.
101

101

00:04:05.210  -->  00:04:08.270
So it is in the get the machine learning basics,
102

102

00:04:08.270  -->  00:04:11.240
then data preprocessing templates and here we go,
103

103

00:04:11.240  -->  00:04:12.600
that's the right folder.
104

104

00:04:12.600  -->  00:04:15.560
This contains the python file that I've just saved
105

105

00:04:15.560  -->  00:04:19.710
and this is the data.csb file that is the data set
106

106

00:04:19.710  -->  00:04:22.230
with which we're gonna do the data preprocessing.
107

107

00:04:22.230  -->  00:04:24.780
And then once you find this right folder,
108

108

00:04:24.780  -->  00:04:27.400
what you have to do is click on this tool button here
109

109

00:04:27.400  -->  00:04:31.090
and then set console working directory.
110

110

00:04:31.090  -->  00:04:33.350
All right and now you just set the right folder
111

111

00:04:33.350  -->  00:04:36.170
as a working directory and you're ready to start.
112

112

00:04:36.170  -->  00:04:39.790
Okay so now the second step is to import the libraries
113

113

00:04:39.790  -->  00:04:42.640
the essential libraries that we'll use most of the time
114

114

00:04:42.640  -->  00:04:44.700
to build our machine learning models.
115

115

00:04:44.700  -->  00:04:47.480
So I'm going to introduce here a new section
116

116

00:04:47.480  -->  00:04:51.099
that I'm gonna call importing the libraries
117

117

00:04:51.099  -->  00:04:53.880
and in this code section I'm going to import
118

118

00:04:53.880  -->  00:04:56.243
the three essential libraries which are numpy,
119

119

00:04:56.243  -->  00:04:58.680
matplotlib and pandas.
120

120

00:04:58.680  -->  00:05:00.810
I'm going to explain right now what they are,
121

121

00:05:00.810  -->  00:05:03.150
but first let's import them one by one.
122

122

00:05:03.150  -->  00:05:04.840
So to import a library in general,
123

123

00:05:04.840  -->  00:05:07.193
we need to use the command import,
124

124

00:05:08.200  -->  00:05:10.320
then we add the name of the library,
125

125

00:05:10.320  -->  00:05:12.773
so the first one we're importing is numpy.
126

126

00:05:14.290  -->  00:05:16.450
And then we can give a shortcut just to be more
127

127

00:05:16.450  -->  00:05:17.930
efficient than when coding.
128

128

00:05:17.930  -->  00:05:20.580
And to add a shortcut we type as,
129

129

00:05:20.580  -->  00:05:22.317
and then we give the name of the shortcut,
130

130

00:05:22.317  -->  00:05:24.570
and this is going to be np.
131

131

00:05:24.570  -->  00:05:26.730
This is what we do in common practice.
132

132

00:05:26.730  -->  00:05:28.430
And so what is this numpy library?
133

133

00:05:28.430  -->  00:05:31.210
This numpy library is the library that we'll use
134

134

00:05:31.210  -->  00:05:33.390
to do most of the mathematics in python,
135

135

00:05:33.390  -->  00:05:36.040
and mostly to work with arrays.
136

136

00:05:36.040  -->  00:05:37.030
Because you're gonna see,
137

137

00:05:37.030  -->  00:05:40.430
that when making machine learning models and deep models,
138

138

00:05:40.430  -->  00:05:42.770
we will work mostly with arrays.
139

139

00:05:42.770  -->  00:05:44.830
So that's the first essential library
140

140

00:05:44.830  -->  00:05:46.660
that we'll use most of the time.
141

141

00:05:46.660  -->  00:05:50.466
Then second library, so this second library is matplotlib.
142

142

00:05:50.466  -->  00:05:52.170
And basically this is the library
143

143

00:05:52.170  -->  00:05:54.710
that we'll use to plot nice charts.
144

144

00:05:54.710  -->  00:05:56.170
So it can be to plot some curve,
145

145

00:05:56.170  -->  00:05:57.900
it can be to plot some histograms,
146

146

00:05:57.900  -->  00:06:00.432
some prediction regions some prediction boundary you'll see.
147

147

00:06:00.432  -->  00:06:03.060
We will plot very nice graphs with matplotlib,
148

148

00:06:03.060  -->  00:06:05.400
and so we should absolutely import it.
149

149

00:06:05.400  -->  00:06:10.290
So import matplotlib and actually
150

150

00:06:10.290  -->  00:06:13.110
we're using a sub library of this library
151

151

00:06:13.110  -->  00:06:17.140
which is pyplot and as for numpy we will give it a shortcut
152

152

00:06:17.140  -->  00:06:21.050
and we'll say it is plt all right.
153

153

00:06:21.050  -->  00:06:23.197
And now last library pandas,
154

154

00:06:23.197  -->  00:06:26.825
pandas is an amazing library to import and manage data sets.
155

155

00:06:26.825  -->  00:06:29.260
You will see how it is so practical,
156

156

00:06:29.260  -->  00:06:30.890
and there will be no data set
157

157

00:06:30.890  -->  00:06:33.300
that we won't treat with pandas in this course.
158

158

00:06:33.300  -->  00:06:36.820
So let's import pandas as well,
159

159

00:06:36.820  -->  00:06:39.860
and we're gonna give it a shortcut pd.
160

160

00:06:39.860  -->  00:06:41.736
All right so that's the three essential libraries
161

161

00:06:41.736  -->  00:06:45.050
we'll use in this course so let's import them,
162

162

00:06:45.050  -->  00:06:47.080
cause so far I just wrote the line of code,
163

163

00:06:47.080  -->  00:06:48.680
but now we have to execute them
164

164

00:06:48.680  -->  00:06:51.761
so that we can effectively import the libraries.
165

165

00:06:51.761  -->  00:06:54.900
So to execute a line of code you need to select the line
166

166

00:06:54.900  -->  00:06:57.060
and then you can use a shortcut on your keyboard
167

167

00:06:57.060  -->  00:07:00.180
which is Command + Control + Enter
168

168

00:07:00.180  -->  00:07:02.900
and here we go numpy is just imported.
169

169

00:07:02.900  -->  00:07:06.040
Now let's do the same for pyplots,
170

170

00:07:06.040  -->  00:07:07.950
here we go pyplot imported.
171

171

00:07:07.950  -->  00:07:11.540
And finally pandas, pressing Command + Control + Enter
172

172

00:07:11.540  -->  00:07:14.670
to execute and pandas is now imported.
173

173

00:07:14.670  -->  00:07:15.580
Perfect!
174

174

00:07:15.580  -->  00:07:17.870
Congratulations on making your first step
175

175

00:07:17.870  -->  00:07:19.780
of the data pre-processing journey.
176

176

00:07:19.780  -->  00:07:21.150
We have a few steps left,
177

177

00:07:21.150  -->  00:07:23.200
and we'll do them in the next tutorials.
178

178

00:07:23.200  -->  00:07:24.953
Until then, enjoy machine learning.
