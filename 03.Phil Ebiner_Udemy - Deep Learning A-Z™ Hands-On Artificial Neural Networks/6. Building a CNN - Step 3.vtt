00:00:00.250  -->  00:00:02.670
<v Instructor>Hello and welcome to this Python tutorial.</v>
2

2

00:00:02.670  -->  00:00:05.380
So this tutorial is going to be another quick tutorial,
3

3

00:00:05.380  -->  00:00:07.040
because we will just initialize
4

4

00:00:07.040  -->  00:00:08.930
our convolutional neural network
5

5

00:00:08.930  -->  00:00:10.120
and we know how to do this.
6

6

00:00:10.120  -->  00:00:13.340
It's exactly the same as initializing a classic
7

7

00:00:13.340  -->  00:00:14.900
artificial neural network.
8

8

00:00:14.900  -->  00:00:17.050
We are going to create an object
9

9

00:00:17.050  -->  00:00:18.570
of the sequential class,
10

10

00:00:18.570  -->  00:00:20.472
and we're gonna call this object classifier,
11

11

00:00:20.472  -->  00:00:23.260
because we are making the classifier
12

12

00:00:23.260  -->  00:00:25.550
that will classify some images,
13

13

00:00:25.550  -->  00:00:28.740
to tell if each image is a picture of a dog or a cat.
14

14

00:00:28.740  -->  00:00:31.600
So we're doing nothing else than classification.
15

15

00:00:31.600  -->  00:00:32.710
Alright, so classifier,
16

16

00:00:32.710  -->  00:00:33.920
and then equals,
17

17

00:00:33.920  -->  00:00:37.890
and then that's where we use the sequential class.
18

18

00:00:37.890  -->  00:00:39.830
And let's not forget the parenthesis.
19

19

00:00:39.830  -->  00:00:42.510
And that creates an object of this class.
20

20

00:00:42.510  -->  00:00:43.480
And that's done.
21

21

00:00:43.480  -->  00:00:46.360
That's all we need to do to initialize our CNN.
22

22

00:00:46.360  -->  00:00:49.850
So let's select this and execute.
23

23

00:00:49.850  -->  00:00:53.760
And now our convolutional neural network is initialized.
24

24

00:00:53.760  -->  00:00:55.970
So now we can move onto the exciting part,
25

25

00:00:55.970  -->  00:00:57.570
adding the different layers.
26

26

00:00:57.570  -->  00:00:59.510
And the first layer that we're going to add
27

27

00:00:59.510  -->  00:01:01.180
is the convolutional layer,
28

28

00:01:01.180  -->  00:01:03.800
and that's what we'll do in the next tutorial.
29

29

00:01:03.800  -->  00:01:05.543
Until then, enjoy deep learning.
