00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:01.310
All right.

2
00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:02.340
Welcome back.

3
00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:06.250
So the challenge the spoons challenge how do you go with that.

4
00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:12.340
Did you manage to get a result and did you see those under-water stones and possibly if you did get

5
00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:17.530
a result then you might be still pondering what it means because it's not something that we're used

6
00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:17.730
to.

7
00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.090
So it just has all of that and more.

8
00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:24.820
And let's have a look at what's going on on that factory.

9
00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:25.870
Let's go through this.

10
00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.430
The fact these activists recently spent $10 million.

11
00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:29.570
Do we need this number.

12
00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:34.690
No we don't need this number because it's an impressive number it's a big number but it doesn't really

13
00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.180
affect our analysis in any way.

14
00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:37.110
It shouldn't.

15
00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.660
Sometimes consultants can be susceptible to pressure from executives.

16
00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.780
You shouldn't be susceptible because your analysis should be independent of what.

17
00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.340
How much money they spend and what outcomes they want.

18
00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.370
You should check the data.

19
00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.200
The data will tell you the truth.

20
00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.620
And so equipment and processes in order to combat excessively hide defects.

21
00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:02.080
So in my future which we're 23 percent at the time which are leading to high returns from clients you

22
00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.740
have been asked to prou for Carnforth level 95 percent.

23
00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:05.170
Great.

24
00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.270
So you know Alpha is equal to 5 percent that the new equipment has improved the situation and that the

25
00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.630
number of defective SMS has decreased to under 18 percent.

26
00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.190
So this is the tricky part.

27
00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.260
We've got two numbers here we've got it used to be 23 percent.

28
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.940
And what they want to have is less than 18 percent.

29
00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:31.750
So in your null hypothesis what are you going to choose are you going to choose 23 percent as your null

30
00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.930
hypothesis situation or are you going to choose 18 percent.

31
00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:41.320
As you know hypothesis situation well in this case the correct answer is 18 percent because what they

32
00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:48.290
want is for you to test if the number of defective spoons has decreased under 18 percent.

33
00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.590
There's not much point in testing if it's under 23 percent because that's not going to answer that question.

34
00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:54.730
That's not what they want.

35
00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:59.110
They probably like you could test that and see if that's correct.

36
00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.630
But they wanted stronger to have a stronger question.

37
00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.420
They want to prove a stronger scenario.

38
00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.840
They want to say that's not just under-23 and it's actually under 18 percent and it doesn't really matter

39
00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:18.150
that this never was the case in real life that previously it was this you're still testing a hypothesis.

40
00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.840
You're no hypothesis what it is now.

41
00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.300
So you know this hypothesis could be.

42
00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:28.390
Right now we assume it's 23 percent still 23 percent or greater and we want to check that it's actually

43
00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.530
dropped below that or your hypothesis can be.

44
00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:35.680
Right now we're assuming that it's 18 percent or greater and we want to see that it's actually below

45
00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.510
that and that's exactly what we're going to be doing.

46
00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:38.770
That's the number you need to use.

47
00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.900
So this number shouldn't be used anywhere in your analysis.

48
00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:48.400
You have been supplied with a random sample of 150 spoons and found that 23 spoons have defects.

49
00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.850
Great.

50
00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.110
So now we know our sample size we know the percentage and the proportion in the sample.

51
00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:59.680
The only thing I wanted to comment here on the law centers is you have been supplied with a random sample.

52
00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.910
If you are chicken salad and if you're working in consulting you probably already know this or if you're

53
00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:10.630
looking for a job in consulting or anything if you ever are doing consulting it is very important to

54
00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.320
be careful about these things.

55
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:20.320
When people say you have been supplied with a random sample the reason for that is why would executives

56
00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.950
supply you or the company supply a random sample.

57
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:29.270
Unfortunately sometimes they can be biased toward supplying you and not exactly a random sample.

58
00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:35.500
It might have less defects than in reality because they did spend 10 million dollars and they might

59
00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.390
want search results from analysis.

60
00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:42.820
Their jobs might be dependent on that so you have to be very careful that when you are supplied a random

61
00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:49.030
sample Ideally you need to go and get that random sample of yourself as a consultant so be careful that

62
00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.400
not saying that executives are all like that.

63
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.510
No not at all.

64
00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:57.800
But as a consultant you kind of like have a due diligence process you should be proud of following.

65
00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.080
And I don't think that really flies with that type of due diligence process.

66
00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:08.020
Nevertheless let's assume that they supplied us a fair random sample so we can proceed with our challenge.

67
00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:14.120
So I'm just going to copy the important information here in just the relevant stuff and let's start

68
00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:15.280
all hypotheses.

69
00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:23.430
So age 0 18 percent or more have defects meaning that the proportion is 18 percent or greater.

70
00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:24.670
Alternative Hypothesis.

71
00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:29.990
Less than 18 percent have defects meaning that P is less than 18 percent.

72
00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.210
Okay that is pretty straightforward.

73
00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.960
Now let's draw our sampling distribution.

74
00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.740
Remember that this is all he had.

75
00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:43.730
This is how we're drawing samples of 150 spoons out of the whole population of the spoons that we have.

76
00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:45.270
And we want to see.

77
00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:45.820
OK.

78
00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.270
So how will they be distributed.

79
00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:54.580
Well according to the central limit theorem these samples will always be distributed or the other had.

80
00:04:54.610 --> 00:05:01.810
So basically the prob the proportion of defective spoons in the samples will always be redistributed

81
00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.440
this way.

82
00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:07.450
So you draw one sample it will be somewhere here John other sample the proportional be drawn up sample

83
00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:08.400
proportional be here.

84
00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:10.190
So it's always going be on all the distribution.

85
00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:15.540
And when we know how the Calcott me the hat and sigma p hat and that's exactly what we're going to do.

86
00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:19.630
So my hat is equal to mu which is equal to P..

87
00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:23.490
And that's just the way this proportion testing works.

88
00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:28.990
So we talked about that this in your formula that we were discussing in the section and that equals

89
00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:30.730
to 0.18.

90
00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:32.320
So we know what that is.

91
00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:38.800
Next on is psig Michaels square root of P-Q another new formula and it equals to 0.38 four.

92
00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:46.020
So hopefully you got these results then Sigma P hats is when divided by skewered and calculate dads

93
00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:47.350
or points or 3:01.

94
00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:50.290
So be had is there a point 1 5 3.

95
00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:55.520
So we know that this is a point 18 he had is zero point one by three and that's just because 23 out

96
00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:57.400
150 So that's a good start.

97
00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.670
It's already less some way here hopefully.

98
00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:05.200
And you know the further away the better because if it's really far away we can just we'll just look

99
00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:10.810
up the P-value or the Zed's score in the Zad table and we'll just reject the null hypothesis.

100
00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:13.490
We'll keep this one and we'll be good to go will be.

101
00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:16.810
We've got the result that we wanted or the executives won.

102
00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:26.260
Now we calculate the SAT score p hat 0 1 1 5 3 minus myu p hat the where is the mean of all of those

103
00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:28.970
P hats in this sampling distribution divide by Sigma.

104
00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:31.620
We had the sampling distributions.

105
00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:37.340
All of those hats in the sampling distribution divide that calculate 0.

106
00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:43.720
Mine is zero point eighty seven and this is probably where you went like oh I'll be really happy if

107
00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:46.830
he actually did go all when you got this zero.

108
00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:52.080
Mine is a point eighty seven when even before you calculated the zeds score you should have gone like

109
00:06:52.580 --> 00:07:00.340
something is not as I usually have seen it before you know something is is different to that way and

110
00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:03.660
only calculate because he had is actually not there.

111
00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:12.490
It's already here and as I recall usually our P hats or or X hats they're sitting and the edges and

112
00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:18.040
the tails and that's what allows us to reject them because it's so unlikely to pick a random sample

113
00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.970
and end up in these tails.

114
00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:25.900
But right now we had is sitting inside the first distribution and if the first of deviation.

115
00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:27.510
And what does that mean for us.

116
00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:36.460
Well we know that 68 percent of all of the P hats will inevitably fall inside the first division between

117
00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:39.370
this box and this box 68 percent of them full in here.

118
00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:47.270
So it's actually pretty likely that the random sample that we selected these 150 spoons and that therapy

119
00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:48.890
had actually fell here.

120
00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:53.830
It doesn't look promising doesn't look that we're going to be able to reject this null hypothesis.

121
00:07:54.010 --> 00:08:01.840
Looks like the null hypothesis is pretty solid at sitting at zero point 18 that if this is the case

122
00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:04.710
we totally could have picked this like there's no magic going on here.

123
00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:05.410
Let's have a look.

124
00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:11.290
So if that's how they score the scalp at all P-value let's not calculate is it up.

125
00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:15.510
So that score minus zero point eighty.

126
00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:24.120
So there's I said let's see where we're going to end up minus zero point eight and 7 7 7 7 7.

127
00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:24.600
All right.

128
00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:32.480
So was there a point 19:22 19:22 19 and 22 percent so 19 percent.

129
00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:34.320
Nineteen point twenty two percent.

130
00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:39.710
So 19 over 19 percent is the likelihood of picking this sample.

131
00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:44.100
If we were picking a random sample and that is way bigger than 5 percent.

132
00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:48.900
So there is no chance of us rejecting this null hypothesis.

133
00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:54.630
And this is this is the part that should have been like a bear a bit a bit new because we have never

134
00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:59.660
had a situation so far where we didn't reject the null hypothesis.

135
00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:02.310
So things are not going as smooth this time.

136
00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:03.270
So what does that mean.

137
00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:04.050
What what does it all mean.

138
00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:07.540
Well it means that first of all we're going to circle isn't green.

139
00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:08.360
I'll explain what it means.

140
00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:10.510
And we're going to cancel this one out.

141
00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:16.170
And now I'll explain why the logic isn't just reverse from what we normally do.

142
00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:21.990
We cannot say here that we reject the alternative hypothesis that we keep the hypoth.

143
00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:23.850
We accept the null hypothesis.

144
00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:31.920
We cannot say that all we can do here is we can only say that there is insufficient evidence to reject

145
00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:33.870
the null hypothesis.

146
00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:34.920
Interesting isn't it.

147
00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:41.220
There is insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis that is the correct statistical terminology

148
00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:47.250
for this situation and I hate to leave you hanging but we're going to have to discuss that in the next

149
00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:52.010
tutorial in the next section of the Course because I was thinking of discussing this in the homework.

150
00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:57.380
But what if somebody doesn't do the homework and then they don't get to understand how to treat these

151
00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:58.290
situations.

152
00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:01.900
That would be a shame because I think it's a very important thing to know.

153
00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:04.070
Just let's jump into the next tutorial.

154
00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:08.640
I hope you were able to get this result in the homework and this is how the homework is solved this

155
00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:10.410
is the final answer.

156
00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:16.530
We cannot reject an all hypothesis and we'll find out exactly what this means in the next tutorial but

157
00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:21.600
just a few comments for the executives or did you tell them Well how does a couple of things as you'll

158
00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:22.610
see from the next tutorial.

159
00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:28.260
You can just pick a larger sample or pick another sample so you'll get more evidence to try and reject

160
00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:28.760
it.

161
00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:34.390
But if you find that this keeps going on that there's just no way you can reject the null hypothesis

162
00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:39.630
and with time you will after several iterations you'll figure out that this looks like it's pretty solid.

163
00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:43.530
It's not less than 18 percent that it might be even 19 or 20 percent.

164
00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:49.080
So what you would go back and do once again you'd either do more samples just to get more evidence or

165
00:10:49.090 --> 00:10:55.620
larger samples as well because you know that will tighten up this end and tighten up this meaning that

166
00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:59.520
this will become even less and you'll make make the distribution like that even more.

167
00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:02.990
But but and then you might have more chances of rejecting happens.

168
00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:07.620
But it can be the case that you just can't reject it because this alternative is just not true.

169
00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:08.760
It's just the case.

170
00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:11.280
It's just as we'll discuss.

171
00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:15.830
It's much like you you just will never have enough evidence to reject it.

172
00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:17.720
So in that case what would you tell the executives.

173
00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:22.920
Always you have to tell the truth because that's what the data is saying and it's your job as a consultant.

174
00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:26.730
The thing is that sometimes maybe they made the wrong decision.

175
00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:30.940
Like what if it wasn't about the equipment that they're using.

176
00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:37.530
What if it wasn't about you know the spoons were they had so much defects not because just because the

177
00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:42.390
equipment that they were using maybe by changing their equipment and processes they did improve the

178
00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:45.330
quality of the spoons but not as much as they wanted to.

179
00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:48.960
Maybe there's something with other parts of the input.

180
00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:52.410
For example the raw materials the raw materials that go into the spoons.

181
00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:57.990
Have they looked at that and as a consultant you would go and probably you know suggest maybe if it's

182
00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:03.810
part of the scope of your project suggest some other things that they could look into like the raw materials

183
00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:09.600
that are being used for these spoons if the raw materials are defective then that inherently translates

184
00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:11.040
into the spoons.

185
00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:12.600
What else could it be.

186
00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:16.370
Maybe they improve the processes but they didn't train up the staff.

187
00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:18.750
Maybe that's another thing they could look at.

188
00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:23.970
So maybe this proves them are manufactured well but then the storage while they're being stored maybe

189
00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:30.120
there is something wrong with the way way sort of like too hot or too cold or is vibration or something

190
00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:30.680
like that.

191
00:12:30.690 --> 00:12:36.630
Maybe that's all there could be lots of things so that's just kind of like a little consulting intermission

192
00:12:37.050 --> 00:12:38.280
about what you might say.

193
00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:40.980
Some ideas that you might have about what's going on.

194
00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:47.070
But other than that in this case we don't reject null hypothesis and we just say that there's not enough

195
00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:50.520
evidence to reject the null hypothesis at that level of confidence.

196
00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:54.250
You know we could reject it at a 80 percent level of confidence because this is nineteen point twenty

197
00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:54.620
two.

198
00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:56.540
Twenty two percent is less than 20 percent.

199
00:12:56.730 --> 00:13:01.620
We could reject that an 80 percent level of confidence but at the same time we're not going to because

200
00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:03.980
we've been asked to do it in a 95 percent confidence.

201
00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:09.120
And what exactly all of this means and how to process it or how to think about intuitively that we will

202
00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:10.620
discuss in the next tutorial.

203
00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:14.550
And I look forward to seeing you there until next time happy analyzing.
