00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:04,100
Hello and welcome back to the course on statistics.

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:10,390
Today we're solving the challenge for the high end fashion boutique and the line of clothes that they're

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:11,880
creating for very tall people.

4
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:15,050
So let's have a look.

5
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:15,980
All right.

6
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:21,920
We're going to open up my folder stats for analytics Section 1 distribution's and let's have a look.

7
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,190
This is our I just copied basically I haven't done much.

8
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:33,170
I've just copied the text about the distributions on the means and standard deviations into Excel and

9
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:34,840
we're going to start off from here.

10
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:40,220
All right so let's create a new tab and here what we're going to do is we're going to first require

11
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:41,390
that information that we had.

12
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:46,800
So we're going to say men women just so that we don't have to jump around between the tabs.

13
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:54,970
OK so here we're going to say mean standard deviation and top this is going to be easier right.

14
00:00:54,980 --> 00:01:02,300
This part topped 2.2 percent or at least this toll this whole challenge was is pretty easy until you

15
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:03,010
get to the charts.

16
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:08,000
If you're paying the charts because they weren't asking the challenge and I'm you know I wonder how

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,560
you went with it.

18
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:14,660
Now we're going to be able to compare the results or be able to see your how you how you went in terms

19
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:16,000
of the findings.

20
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:16,690
So let's have a look.

21
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:20,070
You can do either in inches or centimeters I'm going to two inches.

22
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:27,430
Sixty nine point one trying to get used to these inches like is still a mystery to me.

23
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:31,840
How do you do it in the US do not understand anyway.

24
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:32,850
63.

25
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:33,500
But it's fun.

26
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,590
It's it's good it's good to know both or be able to operate both.

27
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:40,000
I already know that I'm six foot tall.

28
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,180
So that's pretty cool.

29
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,570
Sixty three point seven inches.

30
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:48,360
Sixty three point seven was just seven 24 7 inches.

31
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:52,080
And for women 2.7 inches.

32
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:54,610
Standard deviation 2.7 inches.

33
00:01:54,620 --> 00:02:00,160
You can already tell that the mean is lower but it's also narrower So the chart is going to be taller

34
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,040
for women.

35
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,880
And is going to be it's going to be more like wider for men just a little bit.

36
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:10,140
Toke point 2.2 percent or in this are at least this tall.

37
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:13,080
So that's a threshold that cutoff that we're looking for.

38
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,500
So how do we get it.

39
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,710
So let's have a look.

40
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:22,640
Remember this part where they were asking about a fall for each of the two populations you have been

41
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:28,020
asked to identify the minimum height of 2.2 percent of the tallest people in that population.

42
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,150
So that's that's what we want to do.

43
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:34,970
And the way we're going to do it is we are going to say all right 2.1 Clozaril point on as you can see

44
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:36,550
it matches up really nicely.

45
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:39,930
Further down in the course you'll you'll learn how to do it for any value.

46
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,320
It doesn't have to be like 2.2.

47
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,940
You'll learn how to or basically operate.

48
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:49,190
And you cut off here just create your own cut of and understand anything how to do anything.

49
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:53,750
But here is just very convenient that in this chart is very point two percent so you just need to do

50
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:54,680
your center.

51
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,520
You're a mean plus two standard deviations.

52
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:05,350
And so that will be the value after which like you know hundreds like I'm doing against engineers with

53
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:10,820
say hundred seventy centimeter plus 10 centimeters and or 20 centimeters and then everybody over that

54
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,040
will be 2.2 percent.

55
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:12,950
That type of thing.

56
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:16,990
So we just need to take I mean in this case it's zero but an hour because it's not zero.

57
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:23,390
So I mean plus one or two standard deviations and that means that will be this value that's already

58
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:30,160
here and that will be everything to the right anybody Tola then that will fall and the 2.2 percent.

59
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,660
So hopefully you're able to pick up on that.

60
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:38,150
Another approach would have been to generate the distributions first and then from then pick out the

61
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:39,180
2.2 percent.

62
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:45,520
But that is kind of like a bit of a trap because that's not the population that's the sample.

63
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:51,290
And here it's asking and the challenge is saying totalist of in that population.

64
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:56,790
So if you generate the distributions first that will be just samples rather than populations.

65
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,850
So let's do that let's do what we planned.

66
00:03:58,850 --> 00:03:59,690
We're going to say.

67
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:06,670
I mean Plus we'll all two times stand deviation and go.

68
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:11,720
So seventy four point nine inches and sixty nine point one inches.

69
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,320
That's what we need.

70
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:17,630
And you know what I'm going to do the same thing but I'm going to do it for centimeters as well so if

71
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:24,800
you did it in centimeters and also because I'm just curious real curious 175 do I fall into that 2.2

72
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,160
percent.

73
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,730
Probably not.

74
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:34,300
When do you fall into the 2.2 percent when if we have very tall students taking this course.

75
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,160
All right seven point four.

76
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:36,800
All right.

77
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,260
For men it's 190 centimeters.

78
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:44,090
And for women 160 one point eight sixty one point eight.

79
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:48,210
And standing ovation six point nine.

80
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:49,360
All right so.

81
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,090
Aha.

82
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,590
Interesting.

83
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:54,990
Are we sure about this hundred sixty one point six or nine.

84
00:04:55,430 --> 00:05:01,550
Very interesting so for men or in inches or in centimeters if you are seventy four point nine inches

85
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:04,920
or taller or 190 point three inches or taller.

86
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:13,850
If you are living in the U.S. or if you live in the US you fall in the top 2.2 percent of men in terms

87
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:15,430
of height for women.

88
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:22,220
You need to be sixty nine point one inches tall or a hundred and seventy five point six centimeters

89
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:22,770
tall.

90
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:23,600
OK.

91
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:28,130
So if you know any friends who are very tall ask them how told they are and tell them if they fall in

92
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:29,730
the 2.2 percent.

93
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:31,430
And we're going to now proceed.

94
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:35,330
So that was that part of the challenge where they were asking about the cutoff so obviously they need

95
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:37,600
that for us to understand.

96
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:44,390
You know the is probably for the Close to understand how to cut the clothes or how to what to what to

97
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:45,110
create for the cause.

98
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:49,120
Maybe maybe somebody needed that there and that probably is not for the financial model.

99
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:51,200
That's probably for the clothes part.

100
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:53,000
Now we're going to be solving the parts.

101
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,370
Let's go back to the challenge here.

102
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:00,500
When we saw the part where we need should not two three means you create two distributions.

103
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:06,740
So basically samples we need samples I should have written samples to make it more like clear what we're

104
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:07,400
doing.

105
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:13,490
But a normal distribution of a thousand or or 1000 oversoul a sample from a normal distribution which

106
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:16,180
contains a thousand observations for heights.

107
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:20,720
And then in the U.S. and same for female So we're going to be using a function.

108
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:23,930
And you find that function norm in PS..

109
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:28,640
Let's let's see how we're going to do men here are going to create the distribution for men here.

110
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:34,730
Let's deal with men first and then it will be just easier to then create the same wishes for women.

111
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:36,220
Once we know that approach.

112
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:38,320
All right so we're going to do the distribution.

113
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:46,220
So Norm Dauth in in Excel 2010 using an older version it's Norm interval in fact the norm in them just

114
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:51,450
do Rande brackets mean you can just pointed over here.

115
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,500
No yes.

116
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:54,900
No this one.

117
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:55,610
There you go.

118
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:58,850
And second edition pointed over there.

119
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:00,700
Close your brackets enter.

120
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:06,050
And this is I think is a good challenge because it's always useful to know how to work with Excel and

121
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,320
distributions and stuff.

122
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:10,350
So one a thousand cells go drag it down.

123
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,530
We started one so we need to get to 1000 and 1.

124
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:14,810
Whoa whoa whoa whoa.

125
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:17,210
I mean they're there.

126
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,270
That should be there.

127
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,190
Count 1000.

128
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,020
What's going on.

129
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:22,180
Oh whoops.

130
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:22,980
OK.

131
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:29,150
Yeah I forgot completely forgot you need to press a for to lock it in and look that one in as well.

132
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:30,610
So put the dollar signs.

133
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:34,970
If you're not if you're not putting it in manually if you're just pointing to a cell because if you

134
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:38,800
go out once you go down what's happening is the formula is going down as well.

135
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:42,720
You can see like that I don't want that we want it to be locked.

136
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:47,080
If you click for we'll just lock it then there's just pastes all.

137
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,470
I'll repeat that sorry.

138
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:55,420
I had my press conference C then I press control shift on my Windows PC and then I press down it selects

139
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:57,560
hold the rows and then I press control V.

140
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:01,580
So is this the same as redoing that operation or just like.

141
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:08,620
And so here I want to actually do rounds because nobody measures heights in that many decimal coins

142
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:11,420
so I got a two to one digit.

143
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,890
Just check that area.

144
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:20,660
So again consulship down Enter go just I'm just saying the shortcuts in case somebody doesn't know them

145
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,820
and so we can all follow along together.

146
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,830
If you know them that's that's great.

147
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,060
They are very useful.

148
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:26,770
OK.

149
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:29,550
So that's men and this is what the sample is.

150
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:36,190
And if you notice every time I change any cells if I click to enter I have to enter they all update.

151
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:41,660
So if you want to avoid that then you just need to right click copy and then you pay special and you

152
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:43,850
pays just the values like that.

153
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:47,570
Once you've pasted the values now you can see that there are no normal formulas.

154
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,640
If I change cells nothing happens.

155
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:55,300
We're actually going to keep the formulas because that will help us win and we want the dynamic chart.

156
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:58,640
So just keep them for now you'll see what that means.

157
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,140
OK.

158
00:08:59,300 --> 00:08:59,690
That's it.

159
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:00,750
We supply it.

160
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:01,730
It's ready.

161
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:04,080
And let's just say the same thing for women.

162
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:08,740
So I want to say women here.

163
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:15,050
And then what I'm going to do is I'm going to copy this formula pasted in but now I'm going to replace

164
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:20,550
this so not be two but is actually four women it's B three.

165
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:21,320
There you go.

166
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:25,390
And for the standard missions for women it's three.

167
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:25,950
There you go.

168
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:26,510
All done.

169
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:27,390
Copy.

170
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:31,580
Now I'm going to go to the bottom and sort of like scrolling down if I'm also going to press Kontrol

171
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:37,610
down go from here contrl shift up press enter and then we go there all popular No.

172
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,810
And that's pretty much it.

173
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:43,640
So now you just supply this answer or if you're doing in centimeters you supply this answer and you

174
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,270
supply these two distributions.

175
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:50,140
Probably if you're supplying this to your manager it's best to get rid of the formulas.

176
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:55,880
So what I would suggest is you take these paste copy put them in a new sheet and just right click pay

177
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,990
special and values.

178
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:03,250
As we discussed and now you can you know supply these values these are normally normally just a.

179
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:07,250
But now what you want to do is you want to actually check that they're normally distributed.

180
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:13,430
And in fact we want to build the distribution charge because like I mentioned in the Hince part of the

181
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:17,300
challenge that if you're taking this course you're probably a curious person.

182
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:26,270
You want to learn more and in like engage your brain and you wouldn't go past opportunity to create

183
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:26,610
the charge.

184
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,480
So this is all for the challenge.

185
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:32,440
But for now I'm just going to summarize something I'm going to create the charts and I'm sure you can

186
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,240
enjoy that as well.

187
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:36,220
So how do we create these charts.

188
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,310
How do we visualize as well let's give it a go.

189
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:39,850
Just off the bat.

190
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,110
Just go insert bam like one of these.

191
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,130
Is that a normal distribution.

192
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:50,420
Do you need to go running to your manager saying that you sent them the wrong file and or you sent them

193
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:52,040
incorrect values.

194
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:54,610
Doesn't look like a normal distribution at all.

195
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:56,470
Well what is going on here.

196
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:00,920
Well the thing that's going on here is we got to understand what is being plotted on bottom.

197
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:05,630
You just have the number of the observation on that top over here.

198
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:11,840
You see these values plotted so seventy point nine that's over there then sixty nine point two 73 points

199
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:16,430
just like zigzagging me between these values is where you have a thousand values here and it's just

200
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:18,340
plodding these values like that.

201
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:23,290
And it's a good kind of like verification that it's distributed.

202
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:28,730
Looks like it's distributed around I'll mean sixty nine point one so the mean are here if you look at

203
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:33,860
the horizontal line is six and I'd buy one and send ovations 2.9 so like up and down sometimes a bit

204
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,010
further up sometimes a bit further down.

205
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:37,710
But this is not what we wanted to see.

206
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:40,300
What we want to see is a beautiful bell shaped curve.

207
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:41,120
That's what we want to see.

208
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,420
How do we create that.

209
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:43,740
Well there are two ways.

210
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:49,770
Well first of all we can look at this and create a probability density function.

211
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:54,480
So we remember we talked about those because this is a continuous variable we would create a pre-build

212
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:55,320
and subconscious.

213
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:03,170
On another hand we don't have to because we can create we just can put these in bins and then create

214
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:09,500
a new set of pre-build dysfunction just create a b and chart so it's up to you which one you want to

215
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:09,900
do.

216
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:16,840
I'm going to do the bins simply because it's easier and more but not more important but so because this

217
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:23,300
is these are not the populations these are samples normally for samples which you do is you create them

218
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:24,390
the bins right.

219
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:31,230
If we were creating the building instruction from these like hinting towards the population then yes.

220
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:34,490
But for these that just create the beans it's just going to be faster.

221
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:35,140
OK.

222
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:37,340
So let's have a look.

223
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,140
All right so there is going to be two ways of doing it.

224
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:45,580
Let's start with method number one which is the Microsoft Excel or the Excel recommended one.

225
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:52,460
So the real ones are committed by Microsoft so I'm creating new tabs here and what we're going to do

226
00:12:52,460 --> 00:13:01,290
is we're going to either go to a file if you're using Excel 2010 and options and you need to make sure

227
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:05,660
in the Add ins you have analysis tool packs it's probably going to be somewhere here.

228
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:08,000
Just make sure you have it enabled.

229
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,430
So you just click on it here and then you click go and then you'll get enabled and then you'll be here.

230
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:15,570
So once you have analysis to pack.

231
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:16,460
Now we're talking.

232
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:20,570
Now you can actually do a bit more advanced stuff.

233
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:25,910
So we need to create Albion's for so probably Let's make some space here.

234
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:30,950
Well let's Dobyns before because there are going to be shared between men and women and we're going

235
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:36,650
to start with 50 inches if you're working in centimeters and you need to come up with your own range

236
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:39,060
but just take that kind of like the very low.

237
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:42,660
You might have as a height and very very tall person.

238
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:46,510
So we're going to in inches are going to go from 50 to 100.

239
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,580
OK.

240
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:52,750
You go 50 to 100 and all next is just magic.

241
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:54,800
You just go to data.

242
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,270
You have this new button here.

243
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:59,050
Data analysis so that data analysis.

244
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:04,820
And what we're going to do is we're just going to click on that button here just scroll down and find

245
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:13,520
histogram click OK select input range input ranges Your these these values so select that I press control

246
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,430
shop down to get all of them like that.

247
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,860
And and you've been Range.

248
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:21,010
Select this range.

249
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:21,870
Voila.

250
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:23,880
Now output range.

251
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:25,720
That's where you want to put it.

252
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:31,610
By default it's going to be a new workbook or new worksheet just put output range and I will like to

253
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:32,460
put it here.

254
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:42,260
And just also check chart output so you can you'll get a chart and output and click OK and voila they

255
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:48,670
have it you've got your You've got a bin you frequency and you've got your lovely lovely distribution.

256
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:51,290
That's all you needed to do.

257
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:52,400
I mean a bit too much space.

258
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:56,610
You probably should because we're doing it this way this Excel way.

259
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:58,310
So there we go that's it.

260
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:59,350
But the history here.

261
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:01,620
And then we can do the same thing for women.

262
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:04,390
Maybe you can just make this space here.

263
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:05,730
OK.

264
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,750
So same thing for women.

265
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:11,400
Data Analysis histogram just need to change the input range.

266
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,920
There we go.

267
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:15,480
And output range.

268
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:20,970
Put it somewhere here for example and see if that works.

269
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:28,310
That's right because I move the bins I think I move the bins click OK.

270
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:31,660
All right.

271
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,490
Move my chart over here.

272
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,490
That's OK as well.

273
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:36,090
There we go.

274
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:44,360
So if you put them side by side or in fact you can just copy the site and another data element here.

275
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:47,460
No this is new select data.

276
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:48,050
There you go.

277
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:52,320
So that's the frequency so we want to rename that.

278
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:56,840
We want to name it to men and we want to add a new one.

279
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:58,400
And to call it women.

280
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:04,400
And here we going to select frequency here I like that.

281
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:08,010
Things like that OK.

282
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,450
OK.

283
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:14,400
And they would go see have them on one chart and that's done.

284
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:19,740
So you're going to justice charge to look a bit better but generally as we disconnected this distribution

285
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,050
is narrower taller.

286
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:22,480
This one is wider.

287
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:24,350
So that's how you create these.

288
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:25,530
The only problem we can see.

289
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:32,190
Now if the value if I just click enter anywhere in any cell the values update here but they don't update

290
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:33,270
on the histogram.

291
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:35,720
And that's a drawback of this method.

292
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:38,250
I would just like running short on time in this tutorial.

293
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:44,160
I will record a separate video so just check the next video and then I'll show you how to do it so that

294
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,410
they're dynamic and will be a bit more interesting.

295
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:47,750
You can play around with that.

296
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:54,510
So I hope you enjoy this tutorial and hopefully you also had similar results with your challenge and

297
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:55,370
I'll see you next time.

298
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,790
Until then have reanalyzing.
