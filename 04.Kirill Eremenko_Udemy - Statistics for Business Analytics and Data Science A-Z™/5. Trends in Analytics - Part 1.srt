00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,450
Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:03,530
My name is Vitale.

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:06,770
And today we're going to talk about the trends.

4
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:12,570
It is a very important topic in the business world and today in this tutorial we're going to talk about

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,080
the trends from the business point of view.

6
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:19,090
It is not a hard core statistician lecture.

7
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:27,040
It is a very much business related applicable and applied kind of course.

8
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,510
So we're going to begin with a number 42.

9
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:36,570
If you remember this was the answer to the Ultimate Question of Life the Universe and Everything.

10
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:42,750
According to the Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy but from people not remembering what the question

11
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,570
actually was as the story goes.

12
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:51,960
As a consultant I have a few issues with this number and the main one is there are no numbers to compare

13
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,480
it with.

14
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,940
What do you mean by that.

15
00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:03,000
We could have the number 42 could have been useful if we had it if we had a comparison to peers and

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,780
competitors or to some other numbers.

17
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:08,160
Two related questions.

18
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:16,080
If we had some sort of a trend to these 42 to this number 42 is the declining or increasing comparing

19
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,610
to the expected Drange compare to other numbers or ratios.

20
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:25,850
And there are probably other methods to make it a little bit more clear.

21
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:34,270
What I'm trying to convey in this message to you if I were to tell you that my weight is 80 kilos.

22
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,330
How much would you make out of it.

23
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:44,000
I could bet that probably not much because you need some context you need some background and something

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,400
to compare this number with.

25
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:52,010
You either want to know the weight of my peers that I hang out with my friends and for example I can

26
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:52,860
give you that.

27
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:58,450
Their weights are 80 to 85 and 90 you want to know the trend.

28
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:02,530
What was my weight a month ago two months ago three months ago.

29
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:06,170
And that it will give you an indication if it's increasing or decreasing.

30
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:14,900
You might want to know what were my expectations to be today with my current exercise program with my

31
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,240
current eating patent pendens.

32
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,930
And then you can compare the actual versus expectations.

33
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,240
Or I can give you my height and therefore you could derive these ratios of height to weight ratio.

34
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:31,770
That could make sense to you as opposed to just a blunt number 42 or 80 kills.

35
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:34,810
So having a perspective is very important.

36
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:42,440
And Trents is that kind of perspective that gives flavor to the numbers that you use in the business

37
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,160
world.

38
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:45,810
So pretty much an important topic.

39
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:53,390
If you want to understand your business performance or the KPI performance in real life we're going

40
00:02:53,390 --> 00:03:00,210
to cover some definitions today and I'm going to give you the definitions from my vocab.

41
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:07,130
The way I understand things and the illustration on the right hand side will hopefully be useful to

42
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:08,260
refer to.

43
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:15,890
I've just whipped up this example quickly about the number of cars painted in the workshop during the

44
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:23,200
month of April and you can refer to it once I'm going to be giving you some definitions.

45
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:30,200
So the first one is trending trending is quite a generic term and I usually use it in the context of

46
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:37,100
having system producing some numbers some data it's something objective and something irrelevant to

47
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,230
the analyst.

48
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:45,080
So these blue bars that you see in the chart is effectively the KPI is trending in some sort of direction

49
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:47,960
and you can probably start guessing the direction by

50
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,330
using your logic and your common sense.

51
00:03:53,330 --> 00:04:00,580
So trending is something that KPI does or a parameter that's baselining.

52
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:11,990
And the thing to look for on the right hand side chart is the dotted line baselining is a representation

53
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:16,190
of the past performance and most accurate representation.

54
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:25,720
So if you were to get a baseline without the actual data the blue bars you were you would be able to

55
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:32,230
describe how the past was in the best possible manner forecasting.

56
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:41,310
Forecasting is a process and it's a process of trying to set expectations of where the performance will

57
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,290
be in the future.

58
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:47,670
And it is usually referred to a cyclical type process.

59
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:55,110
In the business world we use monthly forecasts or forecasts quarterly forecasts annual forecasts and

60
00:04:55,110 --> 00:05:07,170
so on and so forth as opposed to extrapolating extrapolating is a term that is referred to as an activity

61
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:08,130
or an analyst.

62
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:15,840
So extrapolating is trying to predict what the future performance will be based on your baseline based

63
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:22,830
on your observations of the trend based on your actual data and analysis of the data so extrapolating

64
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:30,490
extrapolation and the process of extrapolating is actually something else does.

65
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:40,170
So we got our definitions straight I hope and before proceeding any further I wanted to give you one

66
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:44,640
more definition which is of randomness.

67
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:53,640
So randomness is almost opposite of of the forecast and of trending randomness is actually the lack

68
00:05:53,700 --> 00:06:01,500
of structure or system behind something whether it's data points events or whatnot.

69
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:10,410
What we are actually trying to do we are trying to defined and understand trends and understand some

70
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:19,680
models and systems behind the data when the data is totally random it is not going to be possible for

71
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:25,800
us to define by definition a model of the performance or behavior.

72
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:34,010
Randomness could be simulated but not modeled to the extent that it will be predicted with high accuracy.

73
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:41,750
So in the context of the Trents randomness would be almost the opposite of having a trend.

74
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:48,570
And I'm going to give you one more formula in this tutorial that would be useful for the like down the

75
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:52,930
track data that you have in the business.

76
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:58,840
Or you can get from the system is usually a sum of three things.

77
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,420
It is your trend.

78
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:04,030
If there is any plus your outliers.

79
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:09,870
Again if there are any plus noise so systems do produce noise this could be errors.

80
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:13,050
This could be misinterpretations and whatnot.

81
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:18,930
This could be things not related to the way things are and they can blur you.

82
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:23,380
You as an analyst when you are trying to understand what the trend is.

83
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:30,160
So quite important to understand that there are usually three components in your data set.

84
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:38,490
And to give you again the same example of number of cars painted in the painting workshop I'm going

85
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:43,280
to give you the reference to these three definitions.

86
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:54,570
So we talked about trend and trend is in fact the in this case you can try to look at the data and predict

87
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:59,200
the continuation of that line and kind of define your trend.

88
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:04,900
This the 18th of April that point is likely to be an outlier.

89
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:14,220
It looks like it's 20 or maybe a little bit less percentage points less than the usual performance of

90
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:21,600
the workshop and after drilling into the data you can find out that on that specific day there was a

91
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:29,040
fire alarm drill 3 PM and the workshop works from 9:00 to 5:00 p.m..

92
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:36,990

93
9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. So the abnormal event of the fire drill stop the production and therefore affected

94
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:42,930
the output which is number of course painted on that particular day as this event is not something that

95
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:48,060
is likely to happen in the future on a consistent and predictable basis.

96
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:55,200
We can say that the 18th of April is an outlier and excluded from these data set in order to derive

97
00:08:55,560 --> 00:09:00,720
a trend or understand how the KPI performs.

98
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,980
There are other two data points.

99
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:11,220
The 10th and 14th of April they are slightly above the baseline level and if you were to drill into

100
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:20,280
these two data points you would find out that on both days there was rework the cars that were painted

101
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:29,370
we not to a quality standard they were returned into the workshop to do the work all over like from

102
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:38,070
the start however our system our computer has not been capturing these data separately and it was just

103
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:47,660
in the head of a manager that he knew that on the 14th of April for example the two cars were reworked.

104
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:55,830
Therefore the real number of number of cars painted as a now put ready for sale for production is actually

105
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:57,780
one hundred and thirty eight.

106
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:04,710
If you were to consider actually this sellable product at the end so this is an example of a noise something

107
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:15,000
that system has not captured as a result of the inaccuracy of the system and can blow your expectations

108
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:21,540
of how many cars are actually produced on a day or painted on a day.

109
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,700
I hope this was helpful.

110
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:34,020
And one last question before we wrap things up for this tutorial is sometimes a rhetorical question

111
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:40,290
that we will try to give an answer to how many data points do you need to build the trend and.

112
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:51,780
Well Carol we'll talk to you about a scientific answer that is statistical significance and the he will

113
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:55,980
give you an explanation and the definition of how to go around this question.

114
00:10:56,190 --> 00:11:02,340
In this business in the business world there is a rule of thumb that we use to answer to answer that

115
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:05,880
question the data.

116
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:11,250
The number of data points is defined as sufficient.

117
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:19,560
If adding more data points is not going to change the decision or effect the conclusion that we're trying

118
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,780
to draw from the data.

119
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:27,150
It is potentially a vague definition and doesn't give us specifically we need three months of data but

120
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:36,150
it will serve you a good guideline in asking yourself whether you are analyzing enough data points and

121
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:39,220
asking enough questions to make a good prediction.

122
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:47,310
So for when we talk about production and if we were to come back to the example of our workshop the

123
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:55,600
car painting workshop to predict the end of the month performance it would be probably sufficient to

124
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,700
have 23 days worth of data.

125
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:06,610
And while excluding the outlier it would be probably 22 datapoints and understanding a little bit of

126
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:10,720
context what is going to if the performance is going to be affected.

127
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:19,240
In the last few days of the month it will be probably sufficient to derive a trend when we talk about

128
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:20,910
annual performance.

129
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:31,150
Usually look past years performance 12 months is going to is a good indication to derive the forecast

130
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,260
for the next year.

131
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,380
So this is a rule of thumb.

132
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:43,300
It is not a precise rule but think of it from the stakeholder point of view the person you're going

133
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:50,400
to be demonstrating and showing this outputs should should be confident in your data.

134
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:58,510
And if you were to produce more cover more data points in your analysis this is not going to give you

135
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:05,940
additional insights or change the direction of the decision that is going to be made.

136
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:06,720
That is it.

137
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:15,930
I hope the answer was clear or at least gave you some food for thought and until now we're going to

138
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:19,910
break up and I'm hoping to see you in the next tutorial.

139
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,990
Thanks for listening.
