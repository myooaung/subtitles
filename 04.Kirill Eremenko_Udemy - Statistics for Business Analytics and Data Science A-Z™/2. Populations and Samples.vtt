00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:04.670
Hello and welcome back to the course on business statistics and today we're talking about populations

2
00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:05.870
and samples.

3
00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:10.590
Now I'm sure you've already come across the storm so this is going to be just a quick refresher tutorial

4
00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.340
on little breeze through it very swiftly.

5
00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:13.740
OK.

6
00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.330
So let's say we have a population there it is.

7
00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.150
It might be a population of human beings that we're studying and might be a population of animals.

8
00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:28.910
It might be even a population of certain events that occur that we want to observe so it doesn't have

9
00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.580
to be living things that can be just something that we're observing.

10
00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.120
And so this is all called the population.

11
00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:42.110
Now if we take a subset from there then like this then that would be called a sample sample can be random

12
00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:47.570
assemble can be nonrandom usually when we say sample we mean a random sample from the population and

13
00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.300
population has its parameters.

14
00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:56.960
So it has for example the number of observations that you have in that population a number of subjects

15
00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.990
or events or anything of the number of items that you are looking at.

16
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.180
Myu is the mean.

17
00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:11.240
So the average of a certain metric you might be looking at the average height of every person on the

18
00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.770
planet or the average height.

19
00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.260
In that case every person on the planet is your population or if you're looking at the average height

20
00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.010
of people in the US alone then people in the US.

21
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.500
That's the total population.

22
00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:28.220
Or if you're looking at the average height of people in one school then that is your population.

23
00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:34.460
So depending on your experiment depending on your intentions and what you're looking for your population

24
00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:41.240
definition will vary and Sigma as we've seen is the standard deviation in that population which talks

25
00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.110
about variance.

26
00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:48.440
For instance if you're measuring the height of people then Sigma would be the variance in your population.

27
00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.030
So how does height really vary.

28
00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.940
It would be a metric of variance in your sample.

29
00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.130
On the other hand you don't have parameters.

30
00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.620
You have statistics because the sample is a subset of your population.

31
00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.850
So it's important to distinguish between these two terms.

32
00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:09.590
Parameters are set for the whole population or are attributed to the population where as sample sample

33
00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.020
is designed to help you measure the parameters or assess the parameters.

34
00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.100
And therefore you're just getting statistics and statistics pretty much for the same variables as issue

35
00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:20.040
up there.

36
00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.830
These are their counterparts so the small end is for the number of observations in your sample X bar.

37
00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.960
What we're going to be calling and sometimes Sulzer called X hats and it's drawn of a hat on top rather

38
00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.760
than a bar are we going to be using X bar so X bar is your mean.

39
00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.680
Inside that sample and as is your standard deviation.

40
00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:45.470
And so we're going to be using these terms to make sure that we're separating was happening in a sample

41
00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.250
to what's happening inside a population.

42
00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.090
But intellectually this is going to be pretty interesting when we get to sampling distributions because

43
00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.950
it'll be a bit different there as well but nevertheless.

44
00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.580
So what's the point of taking a sample.

45
00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:03.290
Well sometimes the population like if it's a popular publication is all the kids all of the human beings

46
00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:08.900
in a school then yes you can survey all of them and you can get a metric about their height easy but

47
00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.610
if it's a whole population of us there's no way you're going to get every single person in the US to

48
00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:18.920
tell you the height or measure their height is just impractical and it's very costly and timely and

49
00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:25.130
that's why what we do in what's normally done is that people are researchers or even in business for

50
00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.890
instance.

51
00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:33.260
Your population might not be human beings might be events that like how quickly your son like some piece

52
00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.970
of equipment is working in a factory or how quickly your trucks are going back and forth to the delivery

53
00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:39.230
point and back.

54
00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.070
So these are Jaleo events or all the observations in your population.

55
00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:50.570
But in order to assess these parameters which are critical for the business operations you can use samples

56
00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:51.710
to help you determine that.

57
00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:58.720
So we have a certain degree of confidence or accuracy using samples you can determine these and is is

58
00:03:58.730 --> 00:03:59.730
going to be possible.

59
00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:02.440
No it's not going to be impractical like serving the whole population.

60
00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.550
Yes and it's going to be pretty accurate.

61
00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:09.920
So you can be quite confident about the results so that's why we do sampling or that's where you get

62
00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:10.900
samples.

63
00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.270
And that's what we're going to be exploring.

64
00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:18.620
In fact it's pretty straightforward here so if you take a sample you can use these parameters of your

65
00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:25.400
sample to approximate your population but it's not always that easy and straightforward and it's cannot

66
00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:26.510
always be done like that.

67
00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:31.040
That's why we are going to be talking about some more advanced things but the sampling distribution

68
00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.230
in the next tutorial so only 14 in there.

69
00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.150
And until next time happy analyzing.
