00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:04.590
Hello and welcome back to the course on statistics.

2
00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:11.220
And today we're going to talk about what it means when you cannot reject the null hypothesis so breezily

3
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:17.400
we had the homework about the spoons about the factory of the spoons where you were working as a consultant

4
00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.860
and by the way if you haven't done that homework then I highly recommend going back to it before proceeding

5
00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.510
with this tutorial because we're going to discuss the result that we got in that homework and how to

6
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.140
think about it on an intuitive level.

7
00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.970
You still definitely can follow along.

8
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:35.560
You'll be able to pick it up from here even if you haven't done the homework or even at least watch

9
00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:36.210
those tutorials.

10
00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.130
But I think it will be beneficial if you do if you have them.

11
00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.540
Let's get straight into it.

12
00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.490
All right so that was our challenge over there and we discussed what we're working with.

13
00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:51.570
So that's our hypothesis that 18 percent or more have defects.

14
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.650
So just be is greater than or equal to 18 percent less than 80 percent.

15
00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.050
Alternative Hypothesis is that less than 80 percent have defects so he's less than 18 percent.

16
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:08.500
Drew this up did the calculations so we know according to Central Limit Theorem is zero point eighteen

17
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.600
percent plus in your formulas that we learned in the previous section of the Course sigma is 0.3 for

18
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.640
calculates Sigma P had had to 0.1 5:3.

19
00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.180
And so as you can see we can get that score Meinzer point eight.

20
00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:29.430
And and so that means here we got the hat and the hat is sitting only under one standard deviation away

21
00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.660
from me we had and for in terms of our proof.

22
00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.190
That's actually a bad thing.

23
00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:39.840
That means that we will not be able to reject the null hypothesis because as we know if you're sitting

24
00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:47.220
inside one standard deviation Sixty eight percent of observations fall inside the first salivation this

25
00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:47.760
way and this way.

26
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.030
Total 68 percent.

27
00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.470
And so there's no way you're going to reject the null hypothesis over 95 degree.

28
00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:58.110
The center of confidence if you're sitting in here you can do that if you're sitting in the tails because

29
00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.000
we know that 95 percent ninety five point four percent fall into these two standard deviations.

30
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.910
That's why standard deviations are so powerful when you draw them like we know that 95 percent 4.4 percent

31
00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.540
of observations fall into these two standard deviations meaning that if you're sitting side these tails

32
00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.610
anywhere outside here and even a little bit inside like a little tiny bit inside you can reject the

33
00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.770
null hypothesis with 5 percent of 95 percent confidence because there's only like a 5 percent chance

34
00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.260
of being here.

35
00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:31.650
And 95 percent chance here or there is a 5 percent chance of being here.

36
00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:37.230
Fear plus a little bit not just a tiny bit but like a little bit more because you get this tail on this

37
00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.250
side as well so.

38
00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:45.470
So you get 95 percent being here plus like a little bit from here and here that's that's where where

39
00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:46.800
are your 5 percent confidence.

40
00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:53.370
It's nowhere near the internal standard deviation So if you fall inside the internal scientists you're

41
00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:59.940
very safe to say that there's no way you're going to reject something from a 95 percent percent of confidence.

42
00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.440
And as we establish P is equal to nineteen point twenty two percent.

43
00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:09.930
So there's a 19 percent chance that it to fall inside this huge tail or it's even tails like from here

44
00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:11.760
all the way including the tail.

45
00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:17.430
Nineteen point twenty two percent chance much greater than 5 percent so definitely we cannot reject

46
00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.070
the null hypothesis.

47
00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.360
But at the same time we cannot reject alternative hypothesis either.

48
00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:30.910
There is simply no such language in statistics as to say we reject the alternative hypothesis.

49
00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.880
You can reject the null hypothesis because that's your default scenario that you're saying OK if this

50
00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.840
were true let's test out would we come to any contradiction.

51
00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.650
But if you don't come to a contradiction then it doesn't mean that this one is incorrect.

52
00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.060
That just means that maybe you didn't have enough evidence and that's exactly what we say.

53
00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.230
We didn't have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis.

54
00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.830
A good way to think about it is imagine that the null hypothesis.

55
00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:57.090
Let's do an extreme example.

56
00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:03.930
The null hypothesis says if you eat too much ice cream as much as you want ice cream then to say if

57
00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:09.260
you eat all or 100 buckets of ice cream you will not get sick.

58
00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:10.090
You will never get sick.

59
00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.540
That's the world you live in and then your alternative hypothesis.

60
00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:19.410
Well actually probably if you eat a lot of ice cream you will get sick if you eat over 100 bucks by

61
00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.270
buckets of ice cream you will get sick.

62
00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:23.910
So it's completely unrelated to what we're doing here.

63
00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:31.710
But just as an example so let's let's try and then you go and get a sample so you go and eat over 100

64
00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.850
a bucket of ice cream and you don't get sick.

65
00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:37.950
Does that mean that you can reject the alternative hypothesis.

66
00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:38.950
No it doesn't.

67
00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:42.990
Like if you did get sick then you can reject the null hypothesis because you have an example of when

68
00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:44.070
it's incorrect.

69
00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:48.230
This is the law and you have found an example when the law is incorrect.

70
00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:52.470
And therefore you've completely rejected this law.

71
00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:58.470
It has to be rethought completely like this rule or like law physics or old biology that you won't get

72
00:04:58.470 --> 00:04:58.960
sick.

73
00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:04.050
On the other hand if didn't get sick from the all that ice cream it doesn't mean that you can reject

74
00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:08.380
this alternative hypothesis just means that you have one example of one person who ate all this ice

75
00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:09.800
cream and didn't get sick.

76
00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:14.320
You need more and more and more examples and maybe one of them will reject the null hypothesis.

77
00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:18.900
But you cannot you cannot ever reject the alternative hypothesis if you want to do that you have to

78
00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:22.620
restate your problem and you have to do different tests.

79
00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:24.840
You have to test this hypothesis.

80
00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:30.570
The main one rather than this one so going back to what we're saying is that they have the null hypothesis

81
00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:36.420
and you cannot just prove it to be correct you can prove this one to be correct you can prove this one

82
00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:37.530
to be incorrect.

83
00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:40.490
That's what we're doing we're saying assuming this is correct.

84
00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:43.830
Let's come to a contradiction if we come to a contradiction.

85
00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:45.560
This one is incorrect.

86
00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:51.510
This one is correct but if we don't come to a contradiction then we cannot say that this one is incorrect

87
00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:54.150
because we never assumed it was correct in the first place.

88
00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:59.280
So that's that's the thing we have to keep in mind that the only thing we can say here is that there

89
00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:07.830
is insufficient evidence for us to reject the null hypothesis and hopefully that's clear on what exactly

90
00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:15.570
is going on here and this is this is just a way a mathematical approach to proving hypotheses are theories

91
00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:22.500
and lemmas and so on that you first assume something is correct and then you try to come to a contradiction

92
00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.100
if it's incorrect.

93
00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:27.950
If this is incorrect the only possible alternative has to be correct.

94
00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:31.980
It's just logical So if you assume this is correct you came to a contradiction.

95
00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:32.550
It's incorrect.

96
00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:36.160
The only alternative possible is correct by default.

97
00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:42.120
On the other hand if you assume something was correct you tried to come to a contradiction but you didn't

98
00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:44.100
come to a contradiction here it's totally fine.

99
00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:47.780
This is we're saying no contradiction is totally fine for us to have picked the sample.

100
00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:49.310
You didn't come to a contradiction.

101
00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:53.440
Then that means you cannot say that this is incorrect.

102
00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:55.520
And but also at the same time you have.

103
00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:58.810
It just has nothing to do with Alter alternative just kicks in.

104
00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:01.680
Only when the main one.

105
00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:06.990
When age 0 is incorrect but if zero was it you cannot prove that age is incorrect and there's nothing

106
00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:10.740
you can say about the alternative hypothesis might be true might not be true.

107
00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:13.220
So let's let's explore that in a bit more detail.

108
00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:13.860
So there we go.

109
00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:15.730
That's our two hypotheses.

110
00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:21.780
So what's going on here is that we picked a sample in this world we said OK this is the universe we

111
00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:22.530
live in.

112
00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:26.800
There is our mean of the proportion that we're testing.

113
00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:30.290
We're assuming it's sitting over here at 18 percent.

114
00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:34.170
Let's let's come to a contradiction and prove that this is incorrect.

115
00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:38.490
If this was in the tail we would say that no it's not sitting here it's somewhere to the left and would

116
00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:43.100
prove exactly what we want but we couldn't we didn't come to a contradiction so piece in here.

117
00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:49.110
But the thing is that it doesn't necessarily mean that age 0 has to be correct.

118
00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.860
We assumed it was correct and we didn't come to a contradiction.

119
00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:53.350
But it doesn't mean has to be correct.

120
00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:54.330
Let me show you why.

121
00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:59.280
What is forget about this blue one forget about this distribution that we're testing.

122
00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:07.200
What if in the reals in the real real world not in this age no age zero hypothesize we're all in the

123
00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:08.650
actual real world.

124
00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:10.200
The distribution looks like this.

125
00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:15.230
So myu piece star or this whole green distribution is what we have in the real world.

126
00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:17.760
Could we still pick this sample.

127
00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:22.080
Does this sample look like it could have been picked from this green distribution.

128
00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:22.980
Yes it does.

129
00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:27.180
It looks like it could have been picked from the distribution because maybe it's sitting at you know

130
00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:32.790
like this tail maybe 5 percent is somewhere over there and it's sitting around 10 percent and that's

131
00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:33.590
totally fine.

132
00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:38.040
That means it could have totally come from this distribution no problem.

133
00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:43.120
So there's lots of potential distributions that could be the case so it doesn't necessarily.

134
00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:48.630
The fact that we didn't come to a contradiction doesn't mean that this is correct and this is incorrect.

135
00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:54.420
No it just means that in our case we picked such a sample that totally fits this distribution.

136
00:08:54.420 --> 00:09:00.210
But if this is the real case and we go and pick out another sample get more evidence then maybe next

137
00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:04.920
time we'll pick a sample from here which will work for the green distribution but won't work for the

138
00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:06.020
blue distribution.

139
00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:12.280
And that way in that case we will be able to say okay the blue distribution doesn't work.

140
00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:16.150
And this movie had is incorrect so it has to be more to the left.

141
00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:19.990
But for now the only evidence that we have is not suggesting that that is the case.

142
00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:25.050
So that's why we say there is insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis.

143
00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:28.250
We need to go out and get more evidence and what we need to do will.

144
00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:32.640
You either pick more samples you maybe increase the sample sizes or remember increasing the sample size

145
00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:34.380
will make these discussions narrower.

146
00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:40.110
And so if the green distribution is indeed the true scenario you'll just become narrower look like this

147
00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:46.180
like with very narrow and that means you will most likely pick a probability from here closer to here.

148
00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:52.470
So making your experiment easier making it for you easier to reject the blue distribution and just keep

149
00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:53.210
the green one.

150
00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:56.530
Well and also maybe the grid distribution isn't the case.

151
00:09:56.660 --> 00:10:01.250
Maybe something that maybe the blue disruption is the case and then you'll get closer distribution again.

152
00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:07.830
Yeah so the only thing you can do in this way we structure our hypothesis testing is we're assuming

153
00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:12.600
age zero is the true universe that we live in is correct.

154
00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:17.760
And we tried to come to a contradiction only by comment by coming to a contradiction we can only reject

155
00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:20.580
age zero if we don't come to a contradiction.

156
00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:26.490
It doesn't mean we can reject H-1 just means that it could be something like this where we picked a

157
00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:33.420
p hat which Yes it fits the hypothesized age zero distribution but it also could be coming from an actual

158
00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:35.330
real distribution which is the green one.

159
00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:40.160
And that just means we need more evidence to find out that the blue decision is incorrect.

160
00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:44.400
So there we go that's how hypothesis testing works on an intuitive level.

161
00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:47.700
What happens when you cannot reject that hypothesis.

162
00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:52.040
You just have to state that no we don't have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis.

163
00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:56.190
And maybe you might want to offer a couple of these things you might want to test the opposite.

164
00:10:56.190 --> 00:11:01.830
You might want to do this like as the original scenario the age zero and then test that and or maybe

165
00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:05.580
you might want to change the value not 18 percent to another different percentage.

166
00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:08.390
So you'd have to redesign your experiment.

167
00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:15.060
If this experiment continuously keeps leading to inconclusive results then you just redesign your experiment

168
00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:19.880
and maybe prove a weaker hypothesis or Whereas we said you do the opposite.

169
00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:21.990
So there's lots of things that you can do after that.

170
00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:28.770
But this design of the experiment the only conclusive result that you can hope to get out of it is to

171
00:11:28.770 --> 00:11:31.690
reject the null hypothesis and keep the alternative.

172
00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:35.380
There's no other conclusive results that you can get from an experiment like this.

173
00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:38.440
And while we hear so it all makes sense.

174
00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:45.630
I know it's it's a bit still in you but hopefully we'll have some more practice or in the course so

175
00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:50.920
that you can get your hand get your kind of mind around all of this how this is working.

176
00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:51.230
OK.

177
00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:55.470
So the other thing I wanted to mention while we're here let's get rid of that green distribution and

178
00:11:55.470 --> 00:11:57.960
let's just let's just hypothesize a little bit more.

179
00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:00.900
Let's say we have green disruption here.

180
00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:06.930
Question is could the distribution the blue like we were saying that ludes is true but could the real

181
00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:10.450
real distribution is happening in the real world could it be this green.

182
00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:16.290
Well as long as we're sitting in the earth below above the 5 percent part of the tail.

183
00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:18.960
Yeah this one could be could be the true distribution.

184
00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:21.020
It totally could be the true distribution.

185
00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:26.910
And there's nothing stopping us from saying that that could be the case because as long as we sit inside

186
00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:31.890
as long as we are to the right of the 5 percent of the tail the green one that could be the case and

187
00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:34.110
this distribution could also be the real distribution.

188
00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:37.490
So as long as for this distribution we're sitting to the right.

189
00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:39.690
We this could be a true distribution as well.

190
00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:46.830
So basically you can see that any distribution from here all the way to here could be your true distribution.

191
00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:50.670
So it could be this one could be this one could be this one could be this one it could be this one could

192
00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:55.650
be this one could be any distribution in between here that this pea had actually satisfice and that's

193
00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:59.550
why you know we're getting more evidence you might pick up the head from here and then you cancel out

194
00:12:59.550 --> 00:13:04.980
some distributions by getting out of the hat from here or by from getting from here you're kind of getting

195
00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:10.670
more perhaps more evidence you will be able to narrow it down which distribution is it which we like

196
00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:12.270
which group of distributions.

197
00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:17.220
Every time you get more evidence you will narrow down more and more and every time you pick a larger

198
00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:23.010
sample your distributions will become narrower and therefore your hats will be more extremely close

199
00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:25.180
to the real me.

200
00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:30.540
Whatever it is whether it's here here or here where the real real hat is actually looking.

201
00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:35.970
Another thing here I wanted to mention is that if you look at this interval from here to here as we

202
00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:39.830
said any distribution could be the true distribution in this interval.

203
00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:42.290
And that is called the confidence interval.

204
00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:44.810
But more on that later so we are going to delve into that.

205
00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:47.330
Right now we'll have separate trials about that.

206
00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:49.650
Just a quick heads up that that is yet to come.

207
00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:55.770
So I know this was a tutorial full of information like all this intuitive information about how to think

208
00:13:55.770 --> 00:13:59.460
about the distributions and hypothesis testing.

209
00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:04.620
And it's totally fine if it's still fresh in your mind and you need a bit more time to process it.

210
00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:10.390
Just when we're doing the next exercise and this is like quite a practical courses lots of exercises

211
00:14:10.570 --> 00:14:15.660
just to try to think of these things in those terms or even you could go back to previous exercise and

212
00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:22.140
try to think in terms of what are we what are we trying to prove where are we coming to current addiction.

213
00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:26.610
What are we trying to reject what's the null hypothesis alternative type of what is going on here is

214
00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:32.110
very helpful to think through these things in terms of no hypothesis alternative hypothesis.

215
00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:36.570
What is what are we trying to reject what other contradict what occurred where why are we trying to

216
00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:37.470
get a contradiction.

217
00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:42.030
Things like that because it will help you just get an intuitive feel for this.

218
00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:46.270
It is practically I think impossible to develop an intuitive feel for that.

219
00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:52.110
Just want to Turrell you need to put in practice and that's why we have so many exercises and homework

220
00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:59.550
exercises in this course to really help you develop that hands on skill and also that intuition these

221
00:14:59.550 --> 00:15:00.310
things.

222
00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:01.350
So there we go.

223
00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:04.860
Hope you enjoyed today's tutorial and I look forward to seeing your next them.

224
00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:06.590
Until then happy analyzing.
