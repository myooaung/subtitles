00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,640
Hello and welcome back to the course in statistics.

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:08,050
And finally after all we've been through of the Central Limit Theorem.

3
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:16,810
Finally we're at the stage where we're going to look at the real life business challenge which we will

4
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:19,080
solve with the Central Limit theory.

5
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:21,880
I've got a very exciting challenge prepared for you.

6
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:25,890
You're going to be working as a business analyst for FedEx.

7
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:26,840
How cool is that.

8
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:29,180
Well a quick disclaimer.

9
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:31,870
This course has no affiliation with FedEx whatsoever.

10
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:37,030
This is an education example for illustrative purposes only.

11
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:38,460
So it is all made up.

12
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:44,800
But nevertheless it is very very real life and illustrates the power of central in a theory and how

13
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,490
you could apply it to really boost your career.

14
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:56,890
All right so you're a business analyst working for FedEx and you've been challenged to tell the executives

15
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:00,400
very quickly whether or not they can do a certain delivery.

16
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:02,810
And this has to be done quite fast.

17
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:04,320
Analytics has to be done very fast.

18
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:12,340
So here you've got a map of somewhere in the U.S. somewhere in the center towards towards the west I

19
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:13,320
think.

20
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:18,700
So they have Denver and you have Salt Lake City says so then we're on the right Salt Lake City on the

21
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:29,830
left and a client a business client of FedEx wants to deliver some cargo from Denver to Salt Lake City

22
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,770
and they need and they needed done very quickly there.

23
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,960
They just want to find out if you can do it or not.

24
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:40,020
So let's go through the details of this case study.

25
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:45,910
So you're a business analyst working for Fedex a business client has requested a large Frade to be transported

26
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:48,620
urgently from Denver to Salt Lake City.

27
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,800
When asked about the wait when you asked them about the way or your boss asked him or the weight of

28
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,410
the cargo they could not supply the exact weight.

29
00:01:56,410 --> 00:02:00,410
However they have specified that there are a total of 36 boxes.

30
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:05,470
And from your prior experience with this client you know that this type of cargo follows a distribution

31
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:11,860
with a mean of 72 pounds or thirty two point sixty six kilos and a standard deviation of three pounds

32
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:13,680
or one point thirty six kills.

33
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:19,510
So this could totally be the case when they've very loaded the boxes onto the onto the truck which is

34
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:20,950
supposed to go to the airport.

35
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:26,710
They didn't weigh them up but the they know that these are you know approximately the boxes that they

36
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:32,220
usually supply you and you know that what their boxes usually look like and usually they're about Â£72

37
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:36,380
on average of a standard deviation of three pounds and that's from your prior knowledge.

38
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:37,750
We're working with this client.

39
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,810
And so the question is can you deliver these boxes.

40
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:42,120
Why is a question like that.

41
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:47,770
Well because right now the only plane you currently have in Denver is a Cessna open right riding that

42
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:51,370
right Cessna 208 the Grand Caravan.

43
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:55,360
That's the plane you actually saw in the very start at that image in that image.

44
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:03,180
Exactly a plane with a max cargo weight of two thousand six hundred three pounds or 1193 kilo's.

45
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:08,860
And so based on this information what is the probability that all of the cargo can be safely loaded

46
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:11,090
onto the plane and transport it.

47
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:19,210
So as you can imagine very urgent question very important for your boss to manage it to be able to answer

48
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:24,490
the to tell the client whether or not they should go ahead or they should look for another way to transport

49
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:29,660
the cargo it might be something that is perishable they might need an answer very soon.

50
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:35,440
And moreover how bad would it be if they come to your airport and then it turns out that once they load

51
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,390
the plane the pilot says no this is too much we cannot takeoff.

52
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,230
And it's it's a plane ride it's it's not like you can do something about it.

53
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:46,380
If a plane cannot take off it can take off and that's it.

54
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:48,750
And then they have to turn around and go somewhere else.

55
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:49,780
So there we go.

56
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:55,090
That's the challenge and we're going to solve it together so don't worry about.

57
00:03:55,270 --> 00:04:01,910
You can definitely do it on your own but don't worry if you don't feel that you have enough practice.

58
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:08,260
Because we haven't had any practice yet on how to use the Central Limit theory in real life scenarios

59
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,130
like this one.

60
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:12,990
We will definitely have a homework exercise.

61
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:18,190
Will there'll be a summer exercise at the end of the section which you can do on your own after we've

62
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:18,850
done this one together.

63
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:26,620
So it's totally fine if we just proceed and do this one go step by step and you will see how to think

64
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:30,110
about using the Central them at the rim and the power Leveraging is power.

65
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:32,140
So are you ready.

66
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:32,850
Hope you're excited.

67
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:33,890
Let's get started.

68
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,110
So what's our plan.

69
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:40,330
We're going to walk through the plan first because that will help us understand the intuition behind

70
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:43,530
things and then we'll do the calculations so we're now going to just dive straight into the calques.

71
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:45,440
We want to understand exactly what we're doing.

72
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:51,110
So there's our population of possibly all the boxes that could ever come from this client.

73
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:59,620
That's our population and we know that this population from all from everything that we've seen so far

74
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:06,280
with with this client for many many years we can see that it has a an average or mean of 72 pounds.

75
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:11,610
And the standard deviation of all three pounds and you know that's a pretty accurate estimate of course

76
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:12,330
we don't know.

77
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:16,620
We're not the client we don't know all of all boxers but because we've worked them with them so for

78
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:23,730
so many years we've seen so many phrase from them we can confidently say that that's the situation that's

79
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:24,760
going on.

80
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:26,200
So there we go.

81
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:30,640
But at the same time we don't know what the distribution looks like for this.

82
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:37,830
We we we've seen the boxes we've seen you know we've measured the the mean and standard deviation we

83
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:41,040
know them but we don't know what the underlying distribution is.

84
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:44,400
There they're small boxes bigger boxes.

85
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:49,260
What does it exactly look like we don't know and moreover it's most likely not a normal distribution.

86
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:57,070
So what we could do is we to solve our problem our challenge we could potentially imagine taking a sample

87
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:59,980
of what we actually can we can take a sample.

88
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:04,740
We know that this is six boxes and they're going to send us a sample of 36 boxes so what we're going

89
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:10,160
to get for this plane ride is 36 boxes which is a sample of the total population.

90
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:13,050
But they're going to be picking this sample.

91
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:20,310
We don't know the sample we and moreover we can pick this sample because we don't know the distribution.

92
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:22,290
We don't know what the distribution line looks like.

93
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:28,740
When do we all we know is what we know is I mean and the standard deviation but we don't know the distribution.

94
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:34,770
We don't know this part and therefore we will even if we wanted to we can't pick a sample from that

95
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:38,200
distribution just because we don't have enough information.

96
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:44,430
And at the same time and even if we did even if we could pick a sample from that distribution what use

97
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:52,620
is that sample to us even if somehow by the means of a sample over a magic wand we could pick a sample

98
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:58,310
from this from their distribution somehow what's the point they're just going to send us a sample.

99
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:01,000
It's going to be a different sample most likely because samples.

100
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:05,780
Well we're going to pick a random sample they have a specific sample of boxes that they need shipped.

101
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:07,590
So what's the point of picking a sample.

102
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:14,220
So this is an example of where you can see that just picking a sample doesn't work doesn't work because

103
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:17,560
we can't and doesn't work because even if we could it there's no point in doing that.

104
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:23,040
And this is where most other business analysts are and you would get stuck.

105
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:28,170
They would probably just calculate the average and say OK yes you can probably do the flight or no you

106
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:31,340
can fly but the question is what is the probability.

107
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:36,780
And this is where people who don't know the central limit theorem would be stuck and you'd be at a huge

108
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:43,920
advantage because what you would do is you would take a sampling distribution you take maybe you.

109
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:48,320
Well again you can take these many samples but you just think in this way you'd think.

110
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:56,490
OK so if I had a sampling distribution of this population what it would look.

111
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:57,360
What would it look like.

112
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:02,130
This is just the thought process for now it will make a lot of sense when what what calques we're doing

113
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:05,090
as it is and of course we can pick these lots of sambuca.

114
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:08,300
We can pick one sample of copeck lots but let's just think about this.

115
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:11,620
Let's say we had a sampling distribution what would it look like.

116
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:18,480
Well we know that a sampling distribution of the sample mean would look like a normal That would be

117
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,740
a normal distribution.

118
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:22,660
And we know two more additional things about it.

119
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:31,590
We know first of all that's the mean of this sampling distribution of the sample mean would be exactly

120
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:33,010
the same as the mean.

121
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:37,590
So the mean here would be exactly the same as the mean of this population distribution which we don't

122
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:43,920
even know but we know the mean from Oprah experience so therefore we now know oh well we now know the

123
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,800
meaning of this sampling distribution.

124
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,170
How convenient is that.

125
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:54,030
And also we know that the standard deviation of we know something about the sand third powerful thing

126
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:55,170
about the central limit there.

127
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:01,020
Remember this 3 the the form that it's normal the mean that it's exactly the same and the standard deviation

128
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:07,080
that the standard deviation of the sampling distribution is equal to the standard deviation of the population

129
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:10,890
distribution divided by the square roots of the sample size.

130
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:14,820
And as we know the standard deviation of the population.

131
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:19,830
And guess what the sample size is going to be 36 because they're sending us 36 boxes.

132
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:20,410
We don't.

133
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:26,580
The point is we're going to be looking at sampling distributions of sample means where every single

134
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:30,440
sample similar single mean comes from a sample of 36 and make a bit more sense.

135
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:36,090
Now just now but you can see that already and analysts that is doing this you know it's stuck you on

136
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:43,290
the other hand you bypass this part by using a central limit theorem or what we're doing we're bypassing

137
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:44,910
this part and we're saying OK.

138
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,430
So if we don't take a sample we take many samples.

139
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:51,960
Hypothetically then they're sampling distribution would be a normal distribution.

140
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,910
That's really good.

141
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,370
We know it's mean.

142
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:54,960
There it is.

143
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,760
That's really good.

144
00:09:55,800 --> 00:10:00,470
And we know it's sanitation that's that divide by the square root of 36 that's recalls not what can

145
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:01,050
we do with that.

146
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:01,840
Let's have a look.

147
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:05,850
So there's our original vision there's our sampling distribution of and 36.

148
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:12,470
So let's let's plot the things that we have already so there's our mue that's our mean for urgent discussion.

149
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:16,220
Now we know that the myu of the sampling distibution is going to be exactly the same.

150
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:20,840
So right away we can put her a spot on the right there and then the standard deviation.

151
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:26,420
Same thing we well not exactly the same thing but we know how to calculate it so we're going to know

152
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:31,760
that as well so hypothetically if we're dealing with a hypothetical sampling distribution which again

153
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:38,330
we cannot create from scratch but at the same time if we imagine in our mind we know all these things

154
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:44,410
about it we know that if we were to create and there's only one right and for four if you take some

155
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:50,630
samples of 36 from this population take millions and millions of samples of 36 from the population this

156
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:53,180
is all you're always going to get this sampling distribution.

157
00:10:53,180 --> 00:11:01,010
So the only one sampling distribution for an equal 36 for this group for this original population exists

158
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:06,260
in the US so only one sampling does Russian exist in the world for this program or 3:6 and we already

159
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,530
know so much about it.

160
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:11,040
We know that it's got that mean that's on deviation.

161
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,250
So what can we do with that.

162
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:13,710
Well there we go.

163
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:21,280
Let's just write that down so mue x is equal to mucosal Â£72 Sigma x is equal to Sigma or the salvation

164
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:22,110
we had here.

165
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:28,130
Divide by square root of 36 and that is three because that's our standard deviation the original population

166
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:34,920
which we know from prior experience to have a sort of 3 6 which is 6 and is equals to Mazower 0.5.

167
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,900
Now we know that the plane capacity and this is the part where we are getting to the actual critical

168
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,250
thinking.

169
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:45,330
We know that's the plane capacity is 2600 40 pounds.

170
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:54,410
So what is the critical mass for a given box at which point I'd like if we go beyond we will not be

171
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:54,840
able to.

172
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:56,470
The plane won't be able to lift off.

173
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,370
So let's think about we have thirty six boxes and two in total.

174
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:01,760
They can only way.

175
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,310
Two thousand six hundred forty pounds maximum.

176
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:06,190
If there were more than that then we have a problem.

177
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:12,590
So the critical mass of a box or oven like on an average if we do if we divide the total mass of the

178
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:18,890
boxes the maximal mass that we can have for the boxes which is this by 36 then we'll get the critical

179
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:20,290
mass per box.

180
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:20,790
Right.

181
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:21,660
It doesn't matter.

182
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:27,110
The boxes can all have different weights but we know there's 36 of them so we know that on average the

183
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:33,220
bore the mean or the average weight of a box cannot exceed this value on this vast galley 73 points

184
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:36,140
point six point zero six pounds per box.

185
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:43,730
So if the average weight of a box in the sample that they send us doesn't matter again the the boxes

186
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:48,010
can be from one pound to two more to 50 pounds or 2 to 100 pounds.

187
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:55,430
Doesn't matter for us but if we take the saw the total value the total mass total weight of those boxes

188
00:12:55,430 --> 00:13:00,630
we added up and then we divide by the number of boxes it cannot exceed 73 point 06.

189
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:06,050
And so this is where our sampling distribution comes into play because the sampling distribution one

190
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:11,600
is in a sampling distribution of is a sampling distribution of the sample mean so every time when you

191
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:18,020
build this distribution or the way it what it represents is you take a sample from your point population

192
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:24,710
and then you in that sample of 36 items you calculate the mean you plotted.

193
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,790
Then again you take another sample you Calcott the mean you plotted can take the sample you calculate

194
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:32,480
the mean you plotted and you do that many many times and then you get the sampling distribution.

195
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,210
So now we can plot this value.

196
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:36,280
It's relevant to this chart we can upload it here.

197
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:38,120
And that's going to be our next critical.

198
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,420
So it's somewhere on this chart.

199
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:46,530
So we know that this is Â£72 the mean here and X critical is somewhere on the chart as well.

200
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:51,350
So it's 73 0.06 is to the right so that's where we're putting it here.

201
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:58,640
And so now because X critical care is derived exactly the same way as any other value in the sampling

202
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:03,620
distribution in the sampling distribution you take a sample you it the mean you plotted is critical

203
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:08,690
is you take the sample which you actually have which you're going to have 36 boxes and you take the

204
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:10,720
mean and you plot it.

205
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:11,400
There it is.

206
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:13,180
So the question is now.

207
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,900
Now it kind of starts making sense right now.

208
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:18,320
Now this is this is where the score is going to come in.

209
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,790
So the question is how far away is critical from our mean.

210
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:27,070
In fact what we want to know is what is the probability of us ending up in this part.

211
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:33,170
What is the probability this sampling description describes all of the possible samples of 36 boxes

212
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:37,290
that they could have ever sent us and they would ever send us if they study six boxes.

213
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:41,870
We know that there's six boxes so we know that the sample they're going to send us is definitely going

214
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:45,020
to come from this distribution is going to be one of the values here.

215
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:50,280
The question is what is the probability that this value is going to be beyond extra tickle that.

216
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:57,240
Oh that's the sample they send us is going to exact is is going to have a value that lies over here

217
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:59,770
and that means that plane the plane won't be able to.

218
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:02,390
Well now we just use ours as score.

219
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:05,150
Now it's it's all mechanical from here.

220
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:11,280
Now we just calculate Zed which is X critical minus myu That's distance divided by the Sigma X which

221
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:16,460
we've CALKIN over here so we know how far away in terms of standard deviations we are from the center

222
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:21,560
so there's a center that's how far away we are and it calculate seventy point 0 6.

223
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,020
There it is divide by 72.

224
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:29,370
Divide by 0.5 two point twelfth standard deviation so one two point twelve standard deviations we are

225
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:30,980
way from the center.

226
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:32,800
And so what's the next step.

227
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:34,840
Next step is we bring our table.

228
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,020
Voila.

229
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:39,170
And so we just want to find two point twelve in our table.

230
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:40,400
Let's have a look.

231
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:45,590
So Zed 2.0 12 to do 2.1 2.1 to.

232
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:46,690
There it is.

233
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:49,780
Zero Point 9 8 3 0.

234
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:53,420
Let's put that back so there we go.

235
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:55,250
That's that's pretty much the result.

236
00:15:55,250 --> 00:16:01,020
So the probability of X being less than X for Dickel which is a question that was asked.

237
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,480
Will translate that into question.

238
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:08,390
So the ability of X and X less and X reticle is 0.9 A3 0 which is nine eight point three percent so

239
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:15,000
the probability that the sample they send us is going to be here is ninety eight point three percent.

240
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:20,150
So the probability that the plane can safely take off is ninety eight point three percent.

241
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:20,570
Why is that.

242
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:27,290
Well because the possibility that inside the sample they send us the average mass of a box is going

243
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:32,650
to be less than seventy three point six pounds is eight ninety eight point three percent.

244
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:39,620
And we've established that that is our critical mass which beyond which a plane cannot take off but

245
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:41,790
underneath which the plane can take off.

246
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:48,590
So there's an eight point three percent chance that this plane will take off or is if you do one minus

247
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:54,800
that you'll get like a one point seven percent chance that it cannot take off.

248
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,800
So the answer to that question is yes.

249
00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:02,960
Most likely you will be able to take off of a ninety eight point three percent chance as the Bazawule

250
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:06,350
is just doing this as you could see it took us like 15 minutes.

251
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:13,730
And if if you learn how to do a lot of these like you kind of learn how to apply the central limit theorem

252
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:16,960
and think in these terms you can do it much quicker.

253
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:20,560
And this is because we're going through intuition and the steps.

254
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:24,620
But basically you just go back to imagine say hey OK so there's nine eight point three percent chance

255
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:28,480
that the plane can take off and then the mat is up to the manager to make the call there.

256
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:33,050
What do they do they would just say to the client Yes come along and take that to take that risk of

257
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:41,990
1.7 percent of of it not going ahead or maybe there's an approach of telling the client Hey look from

258
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:46,340
what we know because he didn't weigh up the boxes from what we know about your previous boxes were done

259
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,130
the calculations.

260
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:51,110
And there's a ninety eight point three percent chance of you of this plane taking off.

261
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:53,120
Do you want to take that risk as a manager.

262
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,810
If I were the manager I'd probably do that.

263
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:55,630
It's a safer bet.

264
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:58,750
And and more importantly is backed by statistics right.

265
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:04,220
So if if the plane if it happens so that the plane can take off you will always be able to go back to

266
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:06,090
the client and say look we warned you.

267
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:10,530
We told you there's a 1.7 percent chance you took that risk and these are calculations we can prove

268
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:10,660
it.

269
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:16,490
You know you can you can prove to the client that you did do your Ju-Ju Julians you didn't just come

270
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:18,180
up with a number randomly.

271
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:27,350
So there we go that is the power of the central limit theorem I hope this was a very like Vout valuable

272
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:33,740
example for you that you were able to see how you can use this to your advantage how you can get ahead

273
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:34,230
of the game.

274
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:42,830
So is there's lots of situations where the central limit theory can be applied and you can learn from

275
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:47,600
now because you know all of this you can look out for this in your career and always remember that you

276
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,980
have this super powerful tool in your arsenal and of course they'll be homework.

277
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:56,690
I wish you best of luck with that in this section and I hope you enjoyed learning about the central

278
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,860
theorem and I look forward see you next time.

279
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,620
Until then happy analyzing.
