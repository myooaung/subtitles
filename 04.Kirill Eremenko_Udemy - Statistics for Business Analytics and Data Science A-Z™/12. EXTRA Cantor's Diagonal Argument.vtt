00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:03.530
Hello and welcome back to the course on stats.

2
00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:07.310
Today we're talking about the cantors diagonal argument.

3
00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:08.810
This is an excerpt tutorial.

4
00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:11.560
It's definitely not compulsory.

5
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.640
While none of these are compulsory but is definitely not something that's required for you to understand

6
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:23.570
the rest of the trolls in this course but at the same time I find this whole concept very fascinating

7
00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.680
and I really love the Cantor's argument and I wanted to share with you.

8
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:32.940
I thought it was really really cool I thought you'd like it so this have a look what does it all about.

9
00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:39.800
Well we spoke about continuous variables in this section and we said that continuous variables are different

10
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:45.780
to discrete because there they can take any values and for instance you know the size of your foot.

11
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.240
Could be any value between.

12
00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:57.740
I don't know like 2 or 4 inches or big feet are zero inches to be safe to maybe 24 inches or 50 inches

13
00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:58.820
maximum.

14
00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.230
So how can that be.

15
00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.470
Well let's look at the Circle line.

16
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:08.440
Let's say we have values 0 and 1 in the set theory or in the theory of sets.

17
00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.070
You have different types of numbers right.

18
00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:18.020
Where in real life we have different types of numbers we have normal numbers we have xyz like 1 2 3

19
00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.450
4 5 6 7.

20
00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:24.080
We have fractions we have like one half three quarters.

21
00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.080

22
15:12 is also fraction.

23
00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:34.300
We have irrational numbers which cannot be presented as fractions like pi or what else do we have.

24
00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.260
Ply or square root of 2.

25
00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:42.020
Those are irrational numbers and so in essence any number that you can think of except for imaginary

26
00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.700
numbers.

27
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:48.150
A real number and it goes on this line between me minus infinity plus infinity.

28
00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.110
And but let's just look at between 0 and 1.

29
00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:56.410
The point that we're making is that there is an infinite number of numbers between 0 and 1.

30
00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.640
So we already know that there's an infinite numbers on this line.

31
00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.910
And for instance you could say there's an infinite number of natural numbers so there is not a natural

32
00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:10.490
number but say that natural numbers are like what numbers which you use for counting one apple to apples

33
00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.910
three apples and honesty is an infinite you can well whatever number you say.

34
00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:21.650
I can say a number that plus 1 and therefore there is an infinite number of them but even more interesting

35
00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.630
thing is how can there be an infinite number of numbers between 0 and 1.

36
00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.450
Then that's what the Cantor's diagonal argument is about.

37
00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:34.340
And that the same thing applies to feed size so 4 feet sizes is from 0 to let's say not one but two

38
00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.780
100 inches or 50 inches whatever it is.

39
00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.990
And there's an infinite number of feet sizes in between 0 and 50 inches.

40
00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:47.270
And that's what we mean when we are talking about continuous that's it's a continuum and that's very

41
00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:51.800
very interesting and with the Cantor's diagonal argument what we're going to prove to prove something

42
00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.080
even more powerful even stronger than that.

43
00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.340
We're going to say the number this is the fun is.

44
00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.340
Like I learned this in grade 9 we had a theory of sets.

45
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:08.780
And I remember I was like when we were in class or I think I had like check in the hospital of the times

46
00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.580
I had to be in the hospital for a few days.

47
00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:11.480
But anyway I was.

48
00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.740
I remember I was like a snake instead of playing computer games while I had this time off.

49
00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:19.380
I was so fascinated with mathematics and I loved it.

50
00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:20.500
But what's the point.

51
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.410
The point here is that we're going to prove something even more powerful that.

52
00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.000
Yeah the numbers between 0 and 1.

53
00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:37.340
The amount of real numbers between 0 and 1 is even greater than the number of natural numbers so these

54
00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.350
numbers in here basically can't count them.

55
00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:45.440
If they were the same infinity like this infinity is stronger than that infinity of 1 2 3 4 5 6 and

56
00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.300
up to infinity this infinity between 0 and 1 is even stronger than that infinity.

57
00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:56.030
And what that means is that you cannot count them so you cannot assign every one of the values here

58
00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:57.180
a natural number.

59
00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.370
So let's see how we do that.

60
00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.260
And it's a very simple proof and that's why I love it.

61
00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:05.120
It's such a complex philosophical notion.

62
00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:11.170
So we're going to start rufous square and that in mathematics means that we're starting the proof with

63
00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.690
theory.

64
00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.340
So we're going to make it really really formal here.

65
00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.810
Let's have some fun so here we go.

66
00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:19.510
Let's say we could count them.

67
00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:20.520
Let's make an assumption.

68
00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:26.100
We're going to assume that we did count them like we are to prove something by assuming the opposite.

69
00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.070
And then if we come to a contradiction that means our assumption was incorrect.

70
00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:37.160
So let's say we did count them and we take the first number one label number one we going to assign

71
00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.940
2 and then we write the number that we found that we assigned this label to.

72
00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:42.790
So we did come up with a way to called them.

73
00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:43.950
Now let's just write them out.

74
00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:47.210
If we did how hard is it to write them out just write them.

75
00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:49.040
So we are writing out the first one I got.

76
00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:50.580
So this is what we are saying.

77
00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:51.160
Level 1 2.

78
00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:52.570
OK great.

79
00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:59.940
The second label label number 2 of natural numbers is assigned to real value between 0 and 1 of 0 it

80
00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:05.110
for 3 5 6 2 4 7 and so on and they might be more digits after that we know but we just don't get to

81
00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:11.340
write them all three label the three is assigned to this value four is assigned to this value and so

82
00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:11.490
on.

83
00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:16.680
So let's say we did count them and we're just writing them right here and we just keep doing that we

84
00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.270
just keep writing them all out.

85
00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:24.810
And now what Cantrill agonal argument does is just it's just like his genius is Kunzru says OK how about

86
00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:30.030
we do small quick thing here we just take a diagonal going through these values that we've written out

87
00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:35.040
infinit diagonal going that way and then I'm going to look at it.

88
00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:36.630
What are Cantor says Watch this.

89
00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:38.030
I'm going to do a magic trick.

90
00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:43.920
I'm going to personating him I don't know if he actually said that in my head he says I'm going to come

91
00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:48.600
up with a new number that you don't actually have here that you cannot possibly have in your list of

92
00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:51.630
numbers that you've written out and then you like how you how you did that.

93
00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:52.860
Well it's very simple.

94
00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:57.750
So my numbers going to start with 0 is going to have a dot and then instead of the 9 I'm going to just

95
00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:02.280
take every number like for the first number here I'm going to look at the first row and instead of the

96
00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:04.970
9 going to put any other numbers I'm going to win 8.

97
00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:09.780
And then for the second row I'm going to put any other number you can put a one third row I'm going

98
00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:15.780
to put any other number then a 7 a zero fourth for there are any other than a 9 3 and so on.

99
00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:20.620
So every time for every digit after the decimal I look at that associated roll.

100
00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:24.440
That's why it's called the diagonal and I find the digit that is is there.

101
00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:26.390
And I put any other digit.

102
00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:27.530
So that's my only rule.

103
00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:30.930
OK 9 so put a 1 1 I'll put a 9.

104
00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:31.430
Doesn't matter.

105
00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:37.060
You can put any numbers just as long as they don't match to the one that is above and.

106
00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:38.080
And so on.

107
00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:41.250
And what that means is now the question is.

108
00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:42.260
Ok cool.

109
00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:43.520
I wrote this out.

110
00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:46.460
What number in your process that you finished.

111
00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:47.610
You've written it out.

112
00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:51.480
What number did you assign to this value so this value is indeed between 0 and 1.

113
00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:52.950
So what number did you assigned to it.

114
00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:53.880
Question mark.

115
00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:58.310
And the answer is you haven't decided and you value to it.

116
00:06:58.440 --> 00:06:58.950
Why.

117
00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:06.870
Well because if you tell me that you assigned number like natural number 100 and one to this value I

118
00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:12.240
will say that's not the case because the way I built this number the hundred and first digit in this

119
00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:17.240
number will not match up with what you saying just the way I built it because when I was going through

120
00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:21.560
diagonal as soon as I got to 100 in one I chose the other digit I didn't.

121
00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:26.600
I picked a digit different to the one you have in your Dagh in the in your set that you were denied.

122
00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:31.710
So whatever number you say whatever natural number you think you assigned to this real number is going

123
00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:37.590
to be incorrect because of the way I built this real number and that is that means we have a contradiction.

124
00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:40.710
That means that this scenario is impossible.

125
00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:45.240
That means you couldn't have written them out and we have a contradiction that means our assumption

126
00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:49.310
was initially incorrect and that means we have proven our theory.

127
00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:56.950
That's the number or the the values between 0 and 1 the numbers between 0 and 1 they're infinite.

128
00:07:56.970 --> 00:08:00.800
And moreover they're infinite because there's even more of them than natural numbers.

129
00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:02.060
But that's the second part.

130
00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:02.820
They're infinite.

131
00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:09.930
And moreover they're that infinity is stronger infinity than the infinity of natural numbers.

132
00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:13.350
So basically speak speak and you can prove it the same way.

133
00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:19.380
It is a bit more to it but you can extract and extend that proof and say that the number of real values

134
00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:25.130
from minus infinity to infinity so all numbers you can think of except for imaginary numbers.

135
00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:29.460
Now the number of those numbers is greater than the number of natural numbers.

136
00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:33.720
And it's actually that infinity is identical to the infinity between 0 and 1.

137
00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:40.380
So basically what this is saying is that first of all in terms of what we need for this course continuous

138
00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:40.900
variables.

139
00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:46.680
Indeed they are continuous and that means between any two digits between any two numbers there there's

140
00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:49.980
always a number and more or less infinite amount of them in there.

141
00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:52.010
And dislodges between 0 and 1.

142
00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:58.080
You could say the same thing between 0 and zero point five or 0.4 and zero point forty five between

143
00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:00.900
any two real numbers.

144
00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:05.130
There is an infinite number of numbers and moreover that infinity.

145
00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:10.050
And this is like an exchange something we don't really need for this course but just call that infinity

146
00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:12.810
this infinity is stronger than this infinity.

147
00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:14.670
And that's just mind boggling.

148
00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:18.040
You know it's really hard to imagine infinity on its own.

149
00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:23.970
But OK let's think of it as a theoretical mathematical concept but then it's like Inception is like

150
00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:24.710
a new level.

151
00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:27.780
There's an infinity that is stronger than this infinity.

152
00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:33.000
And like give you a quick heads up if you if you ever decide you're going to set theory even further

153
00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:40.460
you'll find out that there's an infinite amount number of infinite powers so there's infinity there's

154
00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:43.010
an infinity that is even stronger than this infinity.

155
00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:48.540
And then there's an infinity that is even stronger than infinity and it's just kind of just crazy.

156
00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:55.710
It's so cool it's like we you know we work with numbers all the time in life but we don't realize that

157
00:09:55.830 --> 00:10:01.550
these things are how these things are like in the background that there's an infinite number of natural

158
00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:06.770
numbers you can imagine that but that there's an infinite number of numbers on your ruler between 0

159
00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:07.630
and 1.

160
00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:09.930
Now it's not in my that's really hard to imagine.

161
00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:14.700
And then that that infinity is even greater than infinity of natural numbers.

162
00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:19.780
That's just like really really philosophical and really mind boggling.

163
00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:25.130
Anyway hope you enjoyed Cantor's diagonal argument and now you know a little bit more about numbers

164
00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:29.380
and why there's infinite amount of them and why continuous is called continuous.

165
00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:32.150
And I look forward seeing it throughout the rest of the course.

166
00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:33.400
We're going to have lots of fun.

167
00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:35.690
And until next I'm happy analyzing.
