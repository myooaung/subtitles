00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.850
Hello and welcome back to the course on statistics.

2
00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:10.110
Now that we've talked about OneTel and to tell tests let's look at a a real life challenge.

3
00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.550
All right here we go.

4
00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:13.310
You work at a large bookstore.

5
00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:18.400
Your manager believes that's the color of the store walls affects peoples spending.

6
00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:24.330
Previously your store had red interior and customers were spending fifty seven dollars on average with

7
00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.290
a standard of $20.

8
00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:33.640
Now the walls are green and the means spend all of the random sample of customers you selected is $62.

9
00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:39.890
Has there been a significant over 95 percent confidence change in spending or spend.

10
00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:45.640
So interesting challenge as you can see we have the confidence level specified and the numbers are quite

11
00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.230
plausible Don't you think that's when you go into a bookstore if you buy one book maybe you're spending

12
00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:51.970
like 30 or 40 dollars.

13
00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:57.240
Sometimes books are more expensive than that sometimes it can be 50 or maybe even $100 but rarely.

14
00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:04.390
And sometimes people maybe buy two books and therefore it goes up to 60 or maybe like 80 or plus and

15
00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:11.490
therefore like the average could be 57 and standard deviation $20 probably could also be the case.

16
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.140
And now that we've done so many of these examples you should be getting comfortable with the term with

17
00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:23.380
the notion of standard deviation and how it works and therefore you can just like imagine that distribution

18
00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.780
in your head even though it doesn't have to be a normal distribution.

19
00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.100
Absolutely not.

20
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.090
Because as we know we're going to be using it we're going to be the hypothesis testing we're going to

21
00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.790
be doing it stems from the central limit theorem so therefore we don't really care what kind of underlying

22
00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.080
distribution the actual data has.

23
00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:41.020
The population has.

24
00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.820
But nevertheless you can still kind of imagine the spread of your data and what the standard deviation

25
00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.260
of $20 means.

26
00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.520
All right.

27
00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.940
So let's have a look how we're going to solve this.

28
00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.150
Well obviously we stayed are a null hypothesis an alternative hypothesis.

29
00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.950
So no hypothesis is that it has not changed and therefore the mean is $57.

30
00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.000
And the alternative hypothesis is that it has changed.

31
00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.850
I mean it's no longer $50000.

32
00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.500
And you'll notice that this is different order done before.

33
00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:14.080
Previously when we were working with these people that were always stating it's either greater or less

34
00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:15.790
than and then the opposite happens here.

35
00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:16.630
So it would go.

36
00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.430
We would say How has it increased or has decreased.

37
00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.630
And this is kind of like the interesting part that in our case.

38
00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:31.130
Well first of all when you the way the kind of teacher is cool is that.

39
00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:37.840
Has there been a significant change so they tell students to look out for the word in the problem.

40
00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.120
Has there been significant change in Spain.

41
00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:45.850
So if we if we were to say has it been a significant increase in spend then you would put greater that

42
00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:51.760
greater than here and here would be less than or equal to if it was Siggraph significant decrease there

43
00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.570
would be less then here and greater than or equal to here.

44
00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:00.430
And there will be a OneTel T-test but because we have changed is it to tell T-test and output equal

45
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:01.910
and not equal to verb.

46
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:10.030
The problem with that logic is that life is not formulated in mathematical problems you when you're

47
00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:16.780
doing business analytics that's the difference between the this is a crucial one of the crucial differences

48
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:22.090
between what they teach in school and what happens in real life in real life you don't get somebody

49
00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:28.680
who comes up to you and says here's the problem I've written it out and moreover it's correct correct

50
00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:29.780
from a national problem.

51
00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:30.700
Can you solve.

52
00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.440
Nobody's going to tell you what word is going to be here is going to be changed or increase or decrease.

53
00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.820
These are things you have to decide on your own and therefore that kind of like approach.

54
00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:44.230
Look at the problem and look at the word and therefore you will know it's a OneTel the to tell test

55
00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.090
doesn't really work in real life.

56
00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:48.220
You have to decide for yourself.

57
00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:55.780
And in this case is a good example because you don't have prior knowledge you can't rule out a OneTel.

58
00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:00.820
He says you can't rule out one of the size of his Shushan So put the distribution here.

59
00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:02.990
So you cannot rule all you gonna say that.

60
00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:05.180
All right because I painted the walls.

61
00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.290
The balls were red now because they painted the walls green.

62
00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:14.030
It has to go this way like if the men used to be here and now it has to go to the right.

63
00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:16.630
It can be the case.

64
00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:23.020
You can just rule out one tale because what if when you paint if you painted the walls green now it's

65
00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.930
going to drop.

66
00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:26.870
Now instead of higher spend is going to be lower spend.

67
00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:32.170
So that's kind of the logic behind if you can rule out the one of the tells then can be the one tailed

68
00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.830
test.

69
00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:35.100
But in this case you can rule out one of the tails.

70
00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:37.160
It could have been gone up it could have gone down.

71
00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:45.670
The fact that in your specific sample that you say that that has gone up to 62 shouldn't be taken into

72
00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:48.880
account when deciding between a to tell and a OneTel test.

73
00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:53.230
The reason for that is well first of all you're selecting one sample is either going to go up or it's

74
00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:54.790
going to go down in your sample.

75
00:04:54.790 --> 00:05:00.730
And so you can see that that's like it just has to go one way or the other it's not that it for a fact

76
00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:05.920
that it went up this is like it could have gone down in a different sample if let's say if there's like

77
00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:07.870
no change could have been lower it could have been higher.

78
00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:11.820
So it's not a really big deal that it's high.

79
00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:18.530
That's shouldn't guide Dr your decision to OK is higher than the average.

80
00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:19.890
That was so it has.

81
00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:23.110
So then I'm ruling out this I know it's not the case.

82
00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:30.820
You just have a sample and unless you have either the other kind of logic that would allow you to roll

83
00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:37.690
out this one tail then you would rule it out but otherwise because you don't have that kind of internal

84
00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:43.150
knowledge of or just principle like there's a law of physics when you for instance when you increase

85
00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:44.600
something it has to increase.

86
00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:50.860
Well in that case like when you increase if there if there is a law of physics that when you paint walls

87
00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:56.830
green spending increases then you can rule it out because there is no absolutely zero chance that it

88
00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:03.280
could decrease that the spend critique but because there's no such law of physics or there's no no 100

89
00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:07.630
percent guarantee that it couldn't have decreased You cannot rule out the to tell us.

90
00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.800
So it's a very gray area.

91
00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:16.960
It's a very kind of like judgment call and as moral as we saw it's it's easier to prove something in

92
00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:18.890
a OneTel than a tale to tell.

93
00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:24.390
So people sometimes are susceptible like prone to do OneTel test but in this case it's obvious that

94
00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:27.450
you have to do to tell tales because there is no prior knowledge.

95
00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:30.460
There's no there's no way to just rule this out.

96
00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:37.570
And morally even if you saw like a statistic like noncitizen like that overall when people paint their

97
00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:43.750
stores and green spend increases while maybe your store is special Maybe you have special customers

98
00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:48.170
maybe you have maybe yours you like you were in a different industry or something like that so.

99
00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:52.090
Always always consider these things and be careful about what to tell them.

100
00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:57.640
So in this case we're running a total test and that's reflected in how we've stated the hypothesis.

101
00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:02.590
All right so the next stop will nexts mechanics X-Fi right out.

102
00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:07.900
I mean how salvation's just draw them up here so it's easier to operate.

103
00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:10.440
You're probably so used to this image by now.

104
00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:14.970
Next we're going to calculate our mean of our sample sampling distribution.

105
00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:17.020
So this is our sampling distribution.

106
00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:22.390
I mean a sampling distributions equal to I mean as according to the central limit theorem also quintessential

107
00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:27.820
him at them standardization or sampling distribution is the salvation of our population which we know

108
00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:35.440
the square root of and equals 20 divided by square of 80 because 80 is what 80 is our sample size here

109
00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:37.810
goes two point 24.

110
00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:47.860
So let's plot our value that we've extracted the solid or the sample mean that we have observed 62 So

111
00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:51.250
let's say somewhere here it is greater than say somewhere here.

112
00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:57.430
These are mean and let's count that I was at score everything as we saw in simple hypothesis testing.

113
00:07:57.430 --> 00:07:58.960
Very straightforward stuff.

114
00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:05.640
So Zed equals eggs bar minus mu Sigma you x by Sigma X bar.

115
00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:09.040
There we go calculate That's two point twenty three.

116
00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:09.540
OK.

117
00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:11.350
So that's a good start.

118
00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:16.810
So right away by now from all the experience that you have already with these problems you should be

119
00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:19.510
able to tell how are we going here.

120
00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:25.660
You know what what is the what is going to be the value in terms of the P-value because you can see

121
00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:27.300
those two point twenty three.

122
00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:29.830
So it means one to everybody right.

123
00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:32.180
So it's 2:02 two standard deviations away.

124
00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:41.200
So if we look at the Zad table that we bring it up here that table two point twenty three two point

125
00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:43.510
two three there is.

126
00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:55.210
So 9 8 7 1 and we can calculate 1 minus 0.9 and 1 because 987 on this side we need this side equals

127
00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:56.730
0.01 to 9.

128
00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:02.860
By the way a quick tip if you don't want to do that calculation then you can just look at this and remember

129
00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:06.760
it's symmetrical with this region symmetrical so you can just look at this and then it will be the same

130
00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:12.620
on that side just you just need to look for the minus what is at minus two point twenty three.

131
00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:21.250
So if you go minus two point two three zero point zero 8:59 exactly same results are just shows you

132
00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:22.390
that calculation.

133
00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:27.720
And OK so this right out there is our P-value and that's one point twenty nine percent.

134
00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:33.940
There's a 1.2 percent chance that we would have picked this at random and I bet we did.

135
00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:36.150
And so most likely.

136
00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:39.270
So this 5 percent confidence interval.

137
00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:44.460
And if you're doing a OneTel test we would rule this out and not in a to tell test.

138
00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:49.550
Remember we have to divide by two so we have to say 5 percent divided by two is two and a half percent.

139
00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:50.930
We have to compare to that.

140
00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:57.720
And it's still less so it's still less so we still rule that out so therefore it's it's it's changed.

141
00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:03.310
And it is harder to prove a OneTel test exactly for that reason because you divide by 2.

142
00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:10.060
And so if this was for example equal to 4 percent we would have ruled out it in a one tailed test but

143
00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:12.820
we wouldn't be able to rule it out and to tell test.

144
00:10:13.450 --> 00:10:21.160
So in this case no hypothesis is not plausible as it's always is a very low chance that this could have

145
00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:24.250
happened if the null hypothesis was true.

146
00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:30.250
So therefore we conclude that it's not true we reject the null hypothesis and we keep the alternative

147
00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:35.840
hypothesis because this is the only possible alternative to what we rejected so it has to be true.

148
00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:41.200
So there we go that's how you do a to tell test as you can see everything is exactly the same.

149
00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:45.510
Very simple based on what we've already learned this is a very very simple procedure.

150
00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:52.390
The only difference is that you divide by 2 so you now compared to a smaller value and the let's quickly

151
00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:56.830
have a look at how you do this through rejection regions because we discussed that there's two approaches

152
00:10:56.830 --> 00:11:01.300
to Hypothesis Testing like over here you could have gone a bit of a different direction.

153
00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:07.580
So is that rejection region same stuff everything is the same you've got up to here 2.20 three and I

154
00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:12.940
was sort of calculating the value you're going to calculate the critical score Zed critical so you kind

155
00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:18.880
of like reverse engineering a table a little bit you Kalgan the Zed critical at which it's a zed at

156
00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:23.940
which is going to be equal to 2.5 percent 0.2 0.02 five.

157
00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:29.110
So because you know it's 95 percent confidence interval it's a five point five percent Alpher divided

158
00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:31.610
by two is two point five percent.

159
00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:36.620
And now we look at our table or in our table there it is.

160
00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:41.220
So here's two we look for basically in our table we're reverse engineering it.

161
00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:43.690
We want zero point zero to five.

162
00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:45.140
They're just beautiful.

163
00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:53.420
So here you can see zero to five very very round number minus one point nine six.

164
00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:58.570
So you just look at minus one point six and you can symmetrically reflect that here so it's one point

165
00:11:58.780 --> 00:11:59.610
nine six.

166
00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:00.880
On the other side.

167
00:12:01.090 --> 00:12:08.710
And so that's why at one point the 1 9 6 and then you just draw those rejection regions so it's inside

168
00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:14.770
the first and after the first generation just inside the second one so 1.9 six over there and we fall

169
00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:18.930
into that rejection region that is greater than that critical.

170
00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:22.000
Or if you're doing on the left would at that lessons that critical.

171
00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:28.390
And so therefore you can reject the null hypothesis and you keep the alternative one.

172
00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:33.480
So that is the second our second approach to doing this hypothesis is just change it up at the end a

173
00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:34.450
little bit.

174
00:12:34.450 --> 00:12:41.050
And why this is a good approach as well because as we discussed in this case you don't actually have

175
00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:47.410
to look at the Zed table every time if you're dealing with a 95 percent confidence problem.

176
00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:50.590
Then you can just remember that it's one point ninety six.

177
00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:53.740
Do you remember we had 5 percent for 5 percent.

178
00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:55.200
We had one point sixty five.

179
00:12:55.210 --> 00:12:58.660
So for 5 percent you're tail we are rejection.

180
00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:03.280
We just started one point sixty five and at minus one point sixty five somewhere over here.

181
00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:05.250
So it's a bit bigger big.

182
00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:10.090
And also it's not like all the way up to here it's just like a little bit bigger but simply because

183
00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:15.460
that's how quickly the standard distribution normal distribution rises here so you get quite a lot of

184
00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:21.550
values here so you in the here get between one point sixty five and one point ninety six you get the

185
00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:26.630
same number of observations as you get from here to there to the very end.

186
00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:33.550
But that's not the point the point is at one point for a one tail test and a five percent confidence

187
00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:38.710
you would you just have to remember the value of one point sixty five and then just compare this value

188
00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:43.330
get to one point sixty five in a to tell as you just have to remember one point ninety six and compared

189
00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:47.190
to that value and that's provided you don't have to remember them just right now somewhere.

190
00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:49.900
And that's where I should so it's just a bit faster that way.

191
00:13:50.290 --> 00:13:55.840
And also it's kind of like a personal preference whether you want to calculate the value and assess

192
00:13:55.840 --> 00:14:01.990
things from the point of a P-value but because P-value does give you that exact percentage of the likelihood

193
00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:06.610
of that happening so a bit of an additional insight here you don't have a huge hit.

194
00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:08.370
How does that score so you don't know.

195
00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:13.240
All right what is what is the exact P-value for that but maybe you don't need it.

196
00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:15.660
So it depends on how you want to approach this.

197
00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:23.380
So there we go that's the two approaches to solving the hypothesis or performing a hypothesis test in

198
00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:26.000
a two tailed test scenario.

199
00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:33.190
I hope you enjoy this tutorial and hopefully now you've got this new skill in your arsenal and always

200
00:14:33.190 --> 00:14:36.780
remember to look out for the formulation of a problem.

201
00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:45.570
If in doubt it's always probably better to go for to tell Tezz simply because it's harder to prove and

202
00:14:45.770 --> 00:14:46.840
is more general.

203
00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:53.780
It's more generalized and it's just harder to prove so meaning that if you've rejected a null hypothesis

204
00:14:53.780 --> 00:15:00.280
and a two tell scenario then you would have rejected it also in a OneTel test scenario and so you've

205
00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:03.250
kind of done the more diligent thing you've done.

206
00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:09.670
You've taken the more more the stricter approach I would say but yeah other than that it will depend

207
00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:16.030
on the wording of your problem but the actual business scenario that you're exploring.

208
00:15:16.210 --> 00:15:21.010
And on that note I hope you enjoyed today's Tauriel and I look forward to seeing ex them until then

209
00:15:21.210 --> 00:15:22.090
have analyzing.
