00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:06,590
Hello and welcome back to the course on tableau.

2
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:11,700
And today we're talking about aggregations and granularity is going to be a quite an important tutorial

3
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:16,620
because the things that you learn today you will take away and apply throughout this course and throughout

4
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:21,360
all of your work of Tableau because these things govern how tableau operates.

5
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:23,190
So let's get straight into it.

6
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:28,230
Here we've got the chart and the chart that we've created and it's showing us unemployment in the US

7
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,850
a month to month from 2005 to 2015.

8
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:38,450
Now the question that we have is how does tableau know that we want to see it at the monthly level.

9
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:44,970
How does tableau know that this aggregation that is doing summing up the unemployed variable how does

10
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:51,240
it know that we want to see it at the month level how does it know that it needs to sum it up at the

11
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,660
month level.

12
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:54,830
So the answer is quite simple.

13
00:00:54,900 --> 00:01:02,460
Tableau will always aggregate measures at the level of granularity of your worksheet.

14
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:10,290
So in this case because we have this variable here month of period tableau knows that we are intending

15
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:18,510
to see all of this data that we're plotting at the level of one month or at the granularity of a month.

16
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:24,570
And so what that means if was if I remove this if I just drag it out of the dashboard or the worksheet

17
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:26,460
you will see one single dot.

18
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:33,220
So instead of lots of dots or a line tableau has no.

19
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:37,130
Now tableau has no clue at which level granularity we want to see the worksheet.

20
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,550
And it assumes that we just want to see it at the broadest level possible.

21
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,500
And that is at the level of the whole dataset.

22
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:50,100
So what it does is just sums up all of the values for this variable unemployed into one single value

23
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:51,250
and it plots it for you.

24
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:55,650
So I'm just going to control Z and return month of period.

25
00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:01,940
And so that in this case month off period is the variable that governs granularity.

26
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:11,220
Normally what happens or quite like the concept behind Tableau is that measures get aggregated and dimensions

27
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,260
specify the level of granularity and we'll see how that works in a second.

28
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:21,420
In this case month of period even though it's recognized as a measure and it's green it is still the

29
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:24,080
variable that is specifying the level of granularity.

30
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:29,760
And that's because it introduces this axis or timeline at the bottom and it actually specifies that

31
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,410
we want to see it at the monthly level.

32
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:38,070
So it makes sense for Tableau to assume that we want to see this chart at the level of clarity of a

33
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:45,310
month so know what we can do to alter ego aggregation is we can go to analysis and we can actually switch

34
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:45,580
it off.

35
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:51,220
So if you just uncheck this box you'll see that you get this fuzzy chart and now we're just going to

36
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:58,870
replace it with a shape charge just to make it look better and you'll see that now instead of aggregating

37
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:01,240
the data Tableau is just plotting unemployed.

38
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:07,210
So basically it's plotting every single row of our data set separately on this chart.

39
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:12,220
So you're going to have a lot of values for the same month in the same year.

40
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:17,640
And that's because we have two genders and we have a lot of different age groups.

41
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:22,270
And now if we look at the bottom we will see that there is a total of one thousand seven hundred eight

42
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:29,650
marks and that is the total number of rows that we have in our data because our daughters at monthly

43
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:30,710
level.

44
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:39,130
So if we go back to our Plus here we just going to switch aggregation back on and I'll show you another

45
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:42,510
way we can alter aggregation.

46
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:49,720
Now what we can do is instead of switching aggregation off we can introduce a dimension which will change

47
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:54,790
the level of granularity of our dashboard and therefore it will affect the aggregation.

48
00:03:54,790 --> 00:04:00,280
So we're going to take gender and we're going to drag it onto color and right away you can see here

49
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,420
that we have twice as many dots.

50
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:11,020
The blue dots represent male and they're orange dots represent female unemployment for that specific

51
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:11,540
month.

52
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:17,740
And now tableau knows that because we have this variable here which is month period and because we have

53
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:23,980
this dimension in our worksheet it knows that we want to see everything or we want to see all of the

54
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:29,690
measures aggregated at the level of granularity of month plus gender.

55
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:39,610
So if we look down here you'll see that this 244 marks that is twice as many marks as we had when we

56
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:44,620
had months I'll just take gender out for a second and you'll see that we have a hundred and twenty two

57
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:45,610
marks.

58
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:52,060
And so now if you return gender back into color there's two hundred and forty four marks and that is

59
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:58,990
telling us that the level of granularity has become even smaller or bigger actually.

60
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:04,760
So we the chart has become more granular because we've introduced this dimension.

61
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:05,510
What else can we do.

62
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:09,620
We can introduce more dimensions to increased granularity even further.

63
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:14,540
So let's take H and drag it into shape.

64
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:22,840
So now you can see many more marks and you still see orange and blue orange represents gender and a

65
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:25,970
blue already represents female and blue represent male.

66
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,470
But at the same time there's different shapes on the chart.

67
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:31,120
Now there's circles of squares as crosses.

68
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:38,330
There's pluses there's lots of different types of shapes and each shape represents a different group

69
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:46,280
or a different level kind of a different data points or a different point on our chart and Tableau knows

70
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:51,290
the level we want to aggregate at because it can see all of the dimensions and our worksheet can see

71
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:57,770
that we have gender we can add we have age we have a month period so it knows that this sum is known

72
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:04,090
had now has to be calculated having these this level of granular granularity in mind.

73
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:10,010
So that's how aggregate that's how granularity works and aggregation works together with granularity

74
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:11,210
credit clarity.

75
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:14,720
Let's have a look at different types of aggregations that are available.

76
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,290
So I'm just gonna remove age so it's not too cluttered.

77
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,210
And now what are we going to look at.

78
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:23,610
Is not some of unemployed we're actually going to change it.

79
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:30,820
And if you click this dropdown and go down to measure some here you can change what you want to see.

80
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:35,110
So let's say you want to see the average unemployment for that month.

81
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:39,980
If you click that you'll see the chart didn't change much but the axis actually change.

82
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:47,150
So when you had some it was the total unemployment for that gender for that month.

83
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:53,260
Now if you click measure average you will see that it is the average unemployment for that gender for

84
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,060
the month.

85
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:56,640
There's another one let's look at a median.

86
00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:02,270
See now the chart changes because it's actually showing us and axis changes as well.

87
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:09,640
But now it's not proportional because it's median and now we can see that these marks are presenting

88
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:16,840
the medium median unemployment at the level of granularity of this worksheet and that level of granularity

89
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:19,630
is month plus gender.

90
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:25,250
And so basically that's how granularity and aggregation work.

91
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:30,910
The only one more thing that I wanted to show you and this is important is detail.

92
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:36,070
So sometimes you might want to increase your level of granularity.

93
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:43,440
You want to make your dashboard more detailed or more granular but you don't want to drag anything on

94
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:54,340
to your eye color or shape you don't want to affect the visual like coloring or other parts of your

95
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:57,030
dashboard but you do want to increase the level of granularity.

96
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,120
Well tableau has a solution for that.

97
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:09,130
There is this option detail in detail doesn't actually mean like detail as in words or description it

98
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:12,150
actually means that level of granularity of your chart.

99
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:16,930
And so let's do that let's take age and instead of dragging it onto shape like we did last time let's

100
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:19,480
put it onto detail and see what happens.

101
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:24,700
Now you can see that the shapes haven't changed but the granularity of the chart has changed.

102
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:32,500
So basically this is an option for you to add dimensions and measures to your dashboard without actually

103
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:37,350
affecting the visual representation but affecting the level of granularity.

104
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:44,710
And that's exactly why this but in detail or this option detail is here is for you to control at which

105
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:47,840
level the aggregation is going to happen.

106
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:54,250
So just remember about that because we will be using that going further in the course and you will definitely

107
00:08:54,940 --> 00:09:00,450
find it helpful and handy when you're doing your own projects for work or at home.

108
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:03,600
So that's all for today I hope that was helpful.

109
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,420
And let me know if you have any questions whatsoever because these are important topics that we will

110
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,570
need going forward.

111
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:17,170
And in the next material we will start creating this awesome looking dashboard for unemployment worksheet

112
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:19,370
for employment worksheet dashboards will come.

113
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:20,050
All right.

114
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,250
I look forward to see you next time.

115
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:22,960
And until then happy analyzing.
