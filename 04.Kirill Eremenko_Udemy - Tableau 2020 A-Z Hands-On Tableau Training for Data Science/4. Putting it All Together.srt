00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:08,830
Hello and welcome back to the course on Tableau.

2
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:14,950
In today's tutorial we will finally create our awesome visualization and get to that deriving those

3
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:15,970
insights.

4
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:19,510
But let's take a step back for a moment and look at what we've actually achieved.

5
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:26,170
So firstly we have been able to connect to a PDA file a read only static file and extract the data from

6
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:29,890
that obtained from an open source data provider.

7
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:36,370
We have been able to combine that with spatial data which we have is not available within tableau which

8
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:43,900
box and get the proper layout off each of these box in terms of their size and their form and also the

9
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:46,300
distribution around the city.

10
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:51,790
We've also managed to iron out a couple of data integrity issues which is of paramount importance.

11
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,290
And therefore this was no easy feat.

12
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,800
And such a valuable skill to have learned.

13
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:59,620
But let's get back to solving the business case.

14
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:00,120
All right.

15
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,100
We already have geometry on to our sheet.

16
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:06,130
Next we'll take the pork name and put that into detail.

17
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:10,960
And the reason for that is at the moment it is just showing one big polygon and we need to actually

18
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,880
break it up too so we can see where each of the different shapes starts and end.

19
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:19,180
So we can just do that by adding it to the detail tab.

20
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:26,030
Now next we can also just take the incidents and add that to color and make sure that that some of incidents.

21
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:32,470
And we know we want to just make it give it a bit more punch to it and let's use temperature diverging

22
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:38,410
from green to red and immediately we can see where the box or the more problematic box are.

23
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:44,090
I do think that the borders are creating a bit of a yellow effect here which we don't want.

24
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:49,240
So let's just go and take the the borders off and that looks much need to know we could even see their

25
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,760
much smaller box as well.

26
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:54,200
What we'll also do is just attack the city burrow.

27
00:01:54,340 --> 00:02:00,220
Put that on to filter and we want to select all of them because this will allow us if we do show the

28
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:05,050
filter and let's just bring it over here it's also selected as a single dropdown.

29
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:11,080
But this will also allow us to navigate the city burrow by borough as you can see as we scroll through

30
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:17,020
then we can see what they look like now how it works in New York is that each city borough is funny

31
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:20,200
enough also a county with in this state.

32
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:27,220
So what we could do is we can just use them that layers and also just tick the county borders and that

33
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:30,550
would actually break them up quite nicely into different boroughs.

34
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:37,540
And on top of that we can select the county names but the county names funny enough is not exactly the

35
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,700
same as the borough names.

36
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,090
So for that reason we'll actually just antique them.

37
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,040
For instance if we look at Richmond over there.

38
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:49,720
That in case in case it's actually the Staten Island although it's called an already Staten Island so

39
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:53,370
what we'll do is we'll just to avoid any confusion.

40
00:02:53,470 --> 00:03:00,550
We'll take off the county names and we can then just rename these using the alias and we can just update

41
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:01,600
these aliases.

42
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:11,800
So if we click alias over there we can take B update to Brooklyn then M2 man Hatton Q to Queens or to

43
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,030
Staten Island.

44
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:18,370
We know that refers to Richmond and then good old Bronx and hit in Tyrone.

45
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:19,450
Okay.

46
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:26,770
Now we are able to navigate city borough by city borough to see which parks have the most incidents

47
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:30,790
not seeing as we are able to they navigate to these areas.

48
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:37,030
Some of these parks have you know obviously their color is adapted to the number of incidents and this

49
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:37,580
is not correct.

50
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:41,010
We want to keep the same color rating across all of them.

51
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:46,600
So if we go into color and just edit this we can just fix the start and end because we know the maximum

52
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:48,640
is six and the minimum zero.

53
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,190
And we can just hit a block.

54
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:56,970
Now if we do go in again you can see that it's not that dark or red that used to be when we do in the.

55
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:02,500
That it was updated the color rating was updated for the specific focus or filter.

56
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:11,470
Let's also just update our sheet them over here because what we want to call this is the New York City

57
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:19,180
parks and we just want to put the borough name in there so we can just pick it up from the insert option

58
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:19,730
over there.

59
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:25,870
But the city borough and we can actually just make that bold and we can decrease the size to 24 for

60
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:27,790
both of these and just hits a plot.

61
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:33,730
So if we do navigate between now we are able to see which one we are working with right in the title

62
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:37,070
so handy stuff as well.

63
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:39,420
But I also like to do is in our map.

64
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:45,600
If you go into map options you are able to see the scale and obviously want to set this to us as we

65
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:46,820
working in the US.

66
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,430
So now you get a scale over there.

67
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:53,170
So if you are focusing on a specific area and you can see how it changes.

68
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:58,600
So on Staten Island the scale is one mile and in Queens it's two miles so it obviously depends on the

69
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:04,420
size of your visualization then you are able to relate on how far and how close each of these sections

70
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:06,570
or each of these Fox ought to each other.

71
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:12,460
Now you can also navigate the city by not only looking at this specific borough bar but just by zooming

72
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:19,390
in and then immediately you can see even the smaller box where there have more of a number of incidents.

73
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:23,560
So pretty handy stuff indeed.

74
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:26,960
So pretty cool way to navigate this as well.

75
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:32,560
And this also answers our brief that we've set out to do and I'm sure outline will be super happy with

76
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,290
what we are delivering now.

77
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:41,680
That is how you connect and combine PDX spatial falls clean your data import your data ensure data integrity

78
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:47,560
create custom geographic polygons using data sources from open source platforms.

79
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,200
Pretty awesome stuff indeed and you can be really proud of yourself.

80
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:56,950
Now in the next tutorial we'll be looking at a brand new business case and look at some improvements

81
00:05:56,950 --> 00:06:02,310
in tableau relating to how we use tool tips and even look at a brand new chart type.

82
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:04,330
I look forward to seeing you next time.

83
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:06,280
Until then happy analyzing.
