00:00:03,200  -->  00:00:06,670
Hello and welcome back to the course on

2

00:00:06,670  -->  00:00:06,680

3

00:00:06,680  -->  00:00:08,320
Tableau. In today's tutorial, we're

4

00:00:08,320  -->  00:00:08,330

5

00:00:08,330  -->  00:00:09,790
starting a brand new challenge which

6

00:00:09,790  -->  00:00:09,800

7

00:00:09,800  -->  00:00:11,799
will be solving in this section of the

8

00:00:11,799  -->  00:00:11,809

9

00:00:11,809  -->  00:00:12,730
course.

10

00:00:12,730  -->  00:00:12,740

11

00:00:12,740  -->  00:00:15,909
Alright, so let's look at the brief.

12

00:00:15,909  -->  00:00:15,919

13

00:00:15,919  -->  00:00:18,040
Alright, you are a data scientists

14

00:00:18,040  -->  00:00:18,050

15

00:00:18,050  -->  00:00:20,050
working for a laundry pick-up services

16

00:00:20,050  -->  00:00:20,060

17

00:00:20,060  -->  00:00:22,750
startup called "We wash, You sleep".

18

00:00:22,750  -->  00:00:22,760

19

00:00:22,760  -->  00:00:25,330
This is a relatively small company and

20

00:00:25,330  -->  00:00:25,340

21

00:00:25,340  -->  00:00:27,040
they cannot compete with the big players

22

00:00:27,040  -->  00:00:27,050

23

00:00:27,050  -->  00:00:29,080
in major cities. The company's strategy

24

00:00:29,080  -->  00:00:29,090

25

00:00:29,090  -->  00:00:31,690
is to build a vast network in this

26

00:00:31,690  -->  00:00:31,700

27

00:00:31,700  -->  00:00:34,869
smaller cities. So we wash, you sleep

28

00:00:34,869  -->  00:00:34,879

29

00:00:34,879  -->  00:00:36,940
already had a strong presence in a

30

00:00:36,940  -->  00:00:36,950

31

00:00:36,950  -->  00:00:38,950
140 locations and recently opened

32

00:00:38,950  -->  00:00:38,960

33

00:00:38,960  -->  00:00:40,930
stores in 10 new cities.

34

00:00:40,930  -->  00:00:40,940

35

00:00:40,940  -->  00:00:42,640
Additionally, the company has two

36

00:00:42,640  -->  00:00:42,650

37

00:00:42,650  -->  00:00:45,880
separate sales region so some just some

38

00:00:45,880  -->  00:00:45,890

39

00:00:45,890  -->  00:00:47,170
additional information on top of

40

00:00:47,170  -->  00:00:47,180

41

00:00:47,180  -->  00:00:49,150
everything else. You have been assigned

42

00:00:49,150  -->  00:00:49,160

43

00:00:49,160  -->  00:00:52,210
two analytics tasks. Number one identify

44

00:00:52,210  -->  00:00:52,220

45

00:00:52,220  -->  00:00:53,860
which of the two sales regions is

46

00:00:53,860  -->  00:00:53,870

47

00:00:53,870  -->  00:00:56,440
performing better, i.e. outperforms the

48

00:00:56,440  -->  00:00:56,450

49

00:00:56,450  -->  00:00:58,240
other in two of the three metrics:

50

00:00:58,240  -->  00:00:58,250

51

00:00:58,250  -->  00:01:00,760
average revenue per city, average

52

00:01:00,760  -->  00:01:00,770

53

00:01:00,770  -->  00:01:02,920
marketing spend per city less is better

54

00:01:02,920  -->  00:01:02,930

55

00:01:02,930  -->  00:01:05,920
obviously, and average ROMI, ROMI stands

56

00:01:05,920  -->  00:01:05,930

57

00:01:05,930  -->  00:01:08,649
for return on marketing investment per

58

00:01:08,649  -->  00:01:08,659

59

00:01:08,659  -->  00:01:11,620
city and that is revenue divide by marketing

60

00:01:11,620  -->  00:01:11,630

61

00:01:11,630  -->  00:01:14,620
spent and challenge number two or

62

00:01:14,620  -->  00:01:14,630

63

00:01:14,630  -->  00:01:16,719
analytics task number two, identify which

64

00:01:16,719  -->  00:01:16,729

65

00:01:16,729  -->  00:01:18,819
of the 10 new locations have the best

66

00:01:18,819  -->  00:01:18,829

67

00:01:18,829  -->  00:01:20,889
potential for the company to invest more

68

00:01:20,889  -->  00:01:20,899

69

00:01:20,899  -->  00:01:22,389
funds into marketing.

70

00:01:22,389  -->  00:01:22,399

71

00:01:22,399  -->  00:01:24,249
Alright so, let's talk about this for a

72

00:01:24,249  -->  00:01:24,259

73

00:01:24,259  -->  00:01:25,779
second before we proceed to the data sets.

74

00:01:25,779  -->  00:01:25,789

75

00:01:25,789  -->  00:01:28,690
So this company we wash you sleep, is a

76

00:01:28,690  -->  00:01:28,700

77

00:01:28,700  -->  00:01:30,730
startup, one of the startups where or

78

00:01:30,730  -->  00:01:30,740

79

00:01:30,740  -->  00:01:32,679
companies where they come to your house,

80

00:01:32,679  -->  00:01:32,689

81

00:01:32,689  -->  00:01:34,389
and you give them the laundry they take away

82

00:01:34,389  -->  00:01:34,399

83

00:01:34,399  -->  00:01:36,789
they wash it and they come back on the

84

00:01:36,789  -->  00:01:36,799

85

00:01:36,799  -->  00:01:39,489
next day, so basically it's all done. You

86

00:01:39,489  -->  00:01:39,499

87

00:01:39,499  -->  00:01:41,349
can even be done in the morning if you

88

00:01:41,349  -->  00:01:41,359

89

00:01:41,359  -->  00:01:43,539
needed very urgently usually takes like

90

00:01:43,539  -->  00:01:43,549

91

00:01:43,549  -->  00:01:45,969
a day or two and they bring back your

92

00:01:45,969  -->  00:01:45,979

93

00:01:45,979  -->  00:01:47,169
laundry and that's it. So you don't even

94

00:01:47,169  -->  00:01:47,179

95

00:01:47,179  -->  00:01:48,519
have to have a washing machine, don't

96

00:01:48,519  -->  00:01:48,529

97

00:01:48,529  -->  00:01:49,719
have to have a dryer.

98

00:01:49,719  -->  00:01:49,729

99

00:01:49,729  -->  00:01:52,330
It's a convenient service so I've used

100

00:01:52,330  -->  00:01:52,340

101

00:01:52,340  -->  00:01:53,859
one of those when I was in the US,

102

00:01:53,859  -->  00:01:53,869

103

00:01:53,869  -->  00:01:56,319
traveling. Very convenient, and I know

104

00:01:56,319  -->  00:01:56,329

105

00:01:56,329  -->  00:01:59,349
there's some in large cities like I use

106

00:01:59,349  -->  00:01:59,359

107

00:01:59,359  -->  00:02:00,909
one in San Francisco.

108

00:02:00,909  -->  00:02:00,919

109

00:02:00,919  -->  00:02:02,620
I don't know about the smaller cities, so

110

00:02:02,620  -->  00:02:02,630

111

00:02:02,630  -->  00:02:05,080
what this company is doing is obviously

112

00:02:05,080  -->  00:02:05,090

113

00:02:05,090  -->  00:02:06,789
as a start-up, you can't compete with big

114

00:02:06,789  -->  00:02:06,799

115

00:02:06,799  -->  00:02:09,010
companies like that that are established

116

00:02:09,010  -->  00:02:09,020

117

00:02:09,020  -->  00:02:10,930
in the market. You can, but it's tough but

118

00:02:10,930  -->  00:02:10,940

119

00:02:10,940  -->  00:02:13,449
their strategy bit different. So, speaking

120

00:02:13,449  -->  00:02:13,459

121

00:02:13,459  -->  00:02:16,330
of strategies, this strategy what

122

00:02:16,330  -->  00:02:16,340

123

00:02:16,340  -->  00:02:18,790
they could be aiming towards, they would

124

00:02:18,790  -->  00:02:18,800

125

00:02:18,800  -->  00:02:20,650
create this network in the smaller

126

00:02:20,650  -->  00:02:20,660

127

00:02:20,660  -->  00:02:22,509
cities and the cities' aren't that small.

128

00:02:22,509  -->  00:02:22,519

129

00:02:22,519  -->  00:02:24,520
They're like 100,000, 200,000,

130

00:02:24,520  -->  00:02:24,530

131

00:02:24,530  -->  00:02:27,100
300,000 people in population so they

132

00:02:27,100  -->  00:02:27,110

133

00:02:27,110  -->  00:02:29,020
will create a network in those cities

134

00:02:29,020  -->  00:02:29,030

135

00:02:29,030  -->  00:02:31,089
and then when the bigger companies,

136

00:02:31,089  -->  00:02:31,099

137

00:02:31,099  -->  00:02:33,880
because it is kind of a new industry,

138

00:02:33,880  -->  00:02:33,890

139

00:02:33,890  -->  00:02:36,580
where the bigger companies expand into

140

00:02:36,580  -->  00:02:36,590

141

00:02:36,590  -->  00:02:39,460
the smaller cities, what this company

142

00:02:39,460  -->  00:02:39,470

143

00:02:39,470  -->  00:02:42,280
could do is they could potentially look

144

00:02:42,280  -->  00:02:42,290

145

00:02:42,290  -->  00:02:44,080
should be acquired. To some, so that

146

00:02:44,080  -->  00:02:44,090

147

00:02:44,090  -->  00:02:45,670
is a valid strategy for a company as

148

00:02:45,670  -->  00:02:45,680

149

00:02:45,680  -->  00:02:49,600
well to create a network in smaller

150

00:02:49,600  -->  00:02:49,610

151

00:02:49,610  -->  00:02:51,160
cities. So when the big company comes

152

00:02:51,160  -->  00:02:51,170

153

00:02:51,170  -->  00:02:52,870
there, instead of doing everything from

154

00:02:52,870  -->  00:02:52,880

155

00:02:52,880  -->  00:02:55,059
scratch they can just buy this smaller

156

00:02:55,059  -->  00:02:55,069

157

00:02:55,069  -->  00:02:57,580
company and rebranded it and so that could

158

00:02:57,580  -->  00:02:57,590

159

00:02:57,590  -->  00:02:58,930
be the reason while, why they're

160

00:02:58,930  -->  00:02:58,940

161

00:02:58,940  -->  00:03:00,430
doing this or maybe there could be other

162

00:03:00,430  -->  00:03:00,440

163

00:03:00,440  -->  00:03:03,039
reasons. So basically this is what's

164

00:03:03,039  -->  00:03:03,049

165

00:03:03,049  -->  00:03:04,210
happening so they're in a 140

166

00:03:04,210  -->  00:03:04,220

167

00:03:04,220  -->  00:03:06,280
locations,  they're expanding to 10 new cities

168

00:03:06,280  -->  00:03:06,290

169

00:03:06,290  -->  00:03:11,380
and now they have two separate sales,

170

00:03:11,380  -->  00:03:11,390

171

00:03:11,390  -->  00:03:13,690
what is what are they called, two separate sales

172

00:03:13,690  -->  00:03:13,700

173

00:03:13,700  -->  00:03:16,330
regions and they're competing with each

174

00:03:16,330  -->  00:03:16,340

175

00:03:16,340  -->  00:03:19,000
other so that's also the strategy where

176

00:03:19,000  -->  00:03:19,010

177

00:03:19,010  -->  00:03:21,670
you split your company to two and to two

178

00:03:21,670  -->  00:03:21,680

179

00:03:21,680  -->  00:03:23,770
geographies and then they have to

180

00:03:23,770  -->  00:03:23,780

181

00:03:23,780  -->  00:03:24,940
compete with each other so they which

182

00:03:24,940  -->  00:03:24,950

183

00:03:24,950  -->  00:03:27,220
one outperforms the other, gets like

184

00:03:27,220  -->  00:03:27,230

185

00:03:27,230  -->  00:03:28,840
bonuses and stuff like that, so that's an

186

00:03:28,840  -->  00:03:28,850

187

00:03:28,850  -->  00:03:30,729
important thing so that's they want to

188

00:03:30,729  -->  00:03:30,739

189

00:03:30,739  -->  00:03:33,250
find out, some metrics there and number

190

00:03:33,250  -->  00:03:33,260

191

00:03:33,260  -->  00:03:35,199
two is this is probably the more

192

00:03:35,199  -->  00:03:35,209

193

00:03:35,209  -->  00:03:36,970
important part of the challenge in the

194

00:03:36,970  -->  00:03:36,980

195

00:03:36,980  -->  00:03:39,610
10 new cities, they want to know which

196

00:03:39,610  -->  00:03:39,620

197

00:03:39,620  -->  00:03:43,120
ones are best positioned to get that

198

00:03:43,120  -->  00:03:43,130

199

00:03:43,130  -->  00:03:46,210
additional marketing funding so if you

200

00:03:46,210  -->  00:03:46,220

201

00:03:46,220  -->  00:03:48,069
put that marked funding into marketing and

202

00:03:48,069  -->  00:03:48,079

203

00:03:48,079  -->  00:03:49,720
then you get more return on your investment.

204

00:03:49,720  -->  00:03:49,730

205

00:03:49,730  -->  00:03:50,409
So that's what we're going to be

206

00:03:50,409  -->  00:03:50,419

207

00:03:50,419  -->  00:03:52,150
researching in part two.

208

00:03:52,150  -->  00:03:52,160

209

00:03:52,160  -->  00:03:54,129
Alright so that's the challenge,

210

00:03:54,129  -->  00:03:54,139

211

00:03:54,139  -->  00:03:55,420
hopefully it all makes sense pretty

212

00:03:55,420  -->  00:03:55,430

213

00:03:55,430  -->  00:03:57,610
exciting and where do we get the data

214

00:03:57,610  -->  00:03:57,620

215

00:03:57,620  -->  00:03:58,000
set?

216

00:03:58,000  -->  00:03:58,010

217

00:03:58,010  -->  00:03:59,620
Well to get the data set, we need a

218

00:03:59,620  -->  00:03:59,630

219

00:03:59,630  -->  00:04:02,680
browser and as usual we need to go to

220

00:04:02,680  -->  00:04:02,690

221

00:04:02,690  -->  00:04:07,270
www.superdatascience.com/tableau. Scroll down here,

222

00:04:07,270  -->  00:04:07,280

223

00:04:07,280  -->  00:04:10,479
you'll find section 8: What's new in

224

00:04:10,479  -->  00:04:10,489

225

00:04:10,489  -->  00:04:11,620
Tableau 10?

226

00:04:11,620  -->  00:04:11,630

227

00:04:11,630  -->  00:04:15,849
So, in this section we've got startup

228

00:04:15,849  -->  00:04:15,859

229

00:04:15,859  -->  00:04:18,430
expansion, excel file and US cities

230

00:04:18,430  -->  00:04:18,440

231

00:04:18,440  -->  00:04:21,069
population csv file. Let's have a look at

232

00:04:21,069  -->  00:04:21,079

233

00:04:21,079  -->  00:04:21,670
them.

234

00:04:21,670  -->  00:04:21,680

235

00:04:21,680  -->  00:04:24,790
So here's the startup expansion file and

236

00:04:24,790  -->  00:04:24,800

237

00:04:24,800  -->  00:04:28,000
in this file, what we have is the store

238

00:04:28,000  -->  00:04:28,010

239

00:04:28,010  -->  00:04:29,830
ID or should probably say

240

00:04:29,830  -->  00:04:29,840

241

00:04:29,840  -->  00:04:33,730
location ID or city ID. This is where the

242

00:04:33,730  -->  00:04:33,740

243

00:04:33,740  -->  00:04:37,000
150 stores or 150 cities where

244

00:04:37,000  -->  00:04:37,010

245

00:04:37,010  -->  00:04:39,939
the company works that's those are the

246

00:04:39,939  -->  00:04:39,949

247

00:04:39,949  -->  00:04:42,250
ideas just basically row ID in this data set.

248

00:04:42,250  -->  00:04:42,260

249

00:04:42,260  -->  00:04:45,250
City is the actual city where the

250

00:04:45,250  -->  00:04:45,260

251

00:04:45,260  -->  00:04:48,700
company's operating, state of that city.

252

00:04:48,700  -->  00:04:48,710

253

00:04:48,710  -->  00:04:51,010
It's actually quite important column

254

00:04:51,010  -->  00:04:51,020

255

00:04:51,020  -->  00:04:53,050
because for many reasons, but also

256

00:04:53,050  -->  00:04:53,060

257

00:04:53,060  -->  00:04:55,810
because sometimes you might get cities

258

00:04:55,810  -->  00:04:55,820

259

00:04:55,820  -->  00:04:58,510
that you don't know which state they're

260

00:04:58,510  -->  00:04:58,520

261

00:04:58,520  -->  00:05:00,969
in because there they might be a city or

262

00:05:00,969  -->  00:05:00,979

263

00:05:00,979  -->  00:05:02,830
several cities with that name in the

264

00:05:02,830  -->  00:05:02,840

265

00:05:02,840  -->  00:05:05,020
U.S. so it's also have always important

266

00:05:05,020  -->  00:05:05,030

267

00:05:05,030  -->  00:05:06,879
to look at city and state. It's like kind of

268

00:05:06,879  -->  00:05:06,889

269

00:05:06,889  -->  00:05:09,159
like month and year right, so you might

270

00:05:09,159  -->  00:05:09,169

271

00:05:09,169  -->  00:05:10,600
know which month but you don't know

272

00:05:10,600  -->  00:05:10,610

273

00:05:10,610  -->  00:05:12,550
which year, so that might be a problem.

274

00:05:12,550  -->  00:05:12,560

275

00:05:12,560  -->  00:05:14,200
So it's always important to know the

276

00:05:14,200  -->  00:05:14,210

277

00:05:14,210  -->  00:05:17,379
exact geography or be specific and we'll

278

00:05:17,379  -->  00:05:17,389

279

00:05:17,389  -->  00:05:19,719
see an example that in this section, then

280

00:05:19,719  -->  00:05:19,729

281

00:05:19,729  -->  00:05:21,129
the sales region so as you can see

282

00:05:21,129  -->  00:05:21,139

283

00:05:21,139  -->  00:05:23,529
they're divided by regions so they

284

00:05:23,529  -->  00:05:23,539

285

00:05:23,539  -->  00:05:25,450
basically divided by states. Some states are in

286

00:05:25,450  -->  00:05:25,460

287

00:05:25,460  -->  00:05:27,460
the region two, some states are in region

288

00:05:27,460  -->  00:05:27,470

289

00:05:27,470  -->  00:05:29,740
one. Right now it's called quite

290

00:05:29,740  -->  00:05:29,750

291

00:05:29,750  -->  00:05:32,320
ambiguous, you can't really tell how it

292

00:05:32,320  -->  00:05:32,330

293

00:05:32,330  -->  00:05:33,730
looks on the map but once we create the

294

00:05:33,730  -->  00:05:33,740

295

00:05:33,740  -->  00:05:35,260
map you'll it will seem pretty

296

00:05:35,260  -->  00:05:35,270

297

00:05:35,270  -->  00:05:37,750
interesting how they've divided into two

298

00:05:37,750  -->  00:05:37,760

299

00:05:37,760  -->  00:05:40,960
sales regions and next we've got a new

300

00:05:40,960  -->  00:05:40,970

301

00:05:40,970  -->  00:05:44,469
expansion so, is this a new city or not?

302

00:05:44,469  -->  00:05:44,479

303

00:05:44,479  -->  00:05:46,180
Basically they're all except for the

304

00:05:46,180  -->  00:05:46,190

305

00:05:46,190  -->  00:05:48,339
bottom 10 which makes sense right so

306

00:05:48,339  -->  00:05:48,349

307

00:05:48,349  -->  00:05:50,650
they got added at the bottom and then

308

00:05:50,650  -->  00:05:50,660

309

00:05:50,660  -->  00:05:52,719
we've got the marketing spend, how much

310

00:05:52,719  -->  00:05:52,729

311

00:05:52,729  -->  00:05:54,460
was invested in the market and

312

00:05:54,460  -->  00:05:54,470

313

00:05:54,470  -->  00:05:57,580
revenue and so by the way in this

314

00:05:57,580  -->  00:05:57,590

315

00:05:57,590  -->  00:06:00,100
specific challenge, it is interesting how or

316

00:06:00,100  -->  00:06:00,110

317

00:06:00,110  -->  00:06:02,830
something to note is that ROMI, return

318

00:06:02,830  -->  00:06:02,840

319

00:06:02,840  -->  00:06:04,270
on marketing investment is calculated

320

00:06:04,270  -->  00:06:04,280

321

00:06:04,280  -->  00:06:07,180
revenue divided by marketing spend sometimes ROMI,

322

00:06:07,180  -->  00:06:07,190

323

00:06:07,190  -->  00:06:09,850
this matrix calculate as profit divided by

324

00:06:09,850  -->  00:06:09,860

325

00:06:09,860  -->  00:06:12,219
marketing spend. So be careful like

326

00:06:12,219  -->  00:06:12,229

327

00:06:12,229  -->  00:06:14,020
depends on the situation, depends on the

328

00:06:14,020  -->  00:06:14,030

329

00:06:14,030  -->  00:06:15,670
definition in this case its revenue

330

00:06:15,670  -->  00:06:15,680

331

00:06:15,680  -->  00:06:18,670
divided marketing spend. And then we've

332

00:06:18,670  -->  00:06:18,680

333

00:06:18,680  -->  00:06:21,550
got another file US cities' population, so

334

00:06:21,550  -->  00:06:21,560

335

00:06:21,560  -->  00:06:24,520
basically it's a file with the

336

00:06:24,520  -->  00:06:24,530

337

00:06:24,530  -->  00:06:26,740
population of the top three hundred US

338

00:06:26,740  -->  00:06:26,750

339

00:06:26,750  -->  00:06:29,409
cities. There are actually more than 300

340

00:06:29,409  -->  00:06:29,419

341

00:06:29,419  -->  00:06:32,710
years cities up to here. A quick hint, all

342

00:06:32,710  -->  00:06:32,720

343

00:06:32,720  -->  00:06:34,839
of our cities the ones we're looking at

344

00:06:34,839  -->  00:06:34,849

345

00:06:34,849  -->  00:06:38,230
these ones here they're actually part of

346

00:06:38,230  -->  00:06:38,240

347

00:06:38,240  -->  00:06:40,480
this top 300 so they're, they're in here

348

00:06:40,480  -->  00:06:40,490

349

00:06:40,490  -->  00:06:40,990
and we will have the population

350

00:06:40,990  -->  00:06:41,490

351

00:06:41,490  -->  00:06:43,990
information on those cities from

352

00:06:43,990  -->  00:06:44,000

353

00:06:44,000  -->  00:06:45,550
here so that's you don't need to worry

354

00:06:45,550  -->  00:06:45,560

355

00:06:45,560  -->  00:06:47,950
about that. As long as we have this file,

356

00:06:47,950  -->  00:06:47,960

357

00:06:47,960  -->  00:06:49,420
we'll have the population will be using

358

00:06:49,420  -->  00:06:49,430

359

00:06:49,430  -->  00:06:51,820
column 2015 estimates, so there's

360

00:06:51,820  -->  00:06:51,830

361

00:06:51,830  -->  00:06:55,000
2010 actual census data 2015 is an

362

00:06:55,000  -->  00:06:55,010

363

00:06:55,010  -->  00:06:56,500
estimate but we'll be working with this

364

00:06:56,500  -->  00:06:56,510

365

00:06:56,510  -->  00:06:59,110
because it's more recent and then

366

00:06:59,110  -->  00:06:59,120

367

00:06:59,120  -->  00:07:00,400
there's some additional information but

368

00:07:00,400  -->  00:07:00,410

369

00:07:00,410  -->  00:07:01,990
that's just an example when you have

370

00:07:01,990  -->  00:07:02,000

371

00:07:02,000  -->  00:07:03,400
additional information that you won't be

372

00:07:03,400  -->  00:07:03,410

373

00:07:03,410  -->  00:07:05,950
using in your analysis, although based on

374

00:07:05,950  -->  00:07:05,960

375

00:07:05,960  -->  00:07:08,469
those things you learn in this section

376

00:07:08,469  -->  00:07:08,479

377

00:07:08,479  -->  00:07:10,030
of the course, you can definitely

378

00:07:10,030  -->  00:07:10,040

379

00:07:10,040  -->  00:07:12,010
experiment with this additional

380

00:07:12,010  -->  00:07:12,020

381

00:07:12,020  -->  00:07:13,659
information and see if that might

382

00:07:13,659  -->  00:07:13,669

383

00:07:13,669  -->  00:07:16,030
somehow fix your cluster analysis and

384

00:07:16,030  -->  00:07:16,040

385

00:07:16,040  -->  00:07:17,770
stuff like that. So that's also just that

386

00:07:17,770  -->  00:07:17,780

387

00:07:17,780  -->  00:07:19,750
just some extra data in case you want

388

00:07:19,750  -->  00:07:19,760

389

00:07:19,760  -->  00:07:20,560
to play around.

390

00:07:20,560  -->  00:07:20,570

391

00:07:20,570  -->  00:07:23,500
Alright so there we go, that's what we

392

00:07:23,500  -->  00:07:23,510

393

00:07:23,510  -->  00:07:25,990
have for the section we've got two data

394

00:07:25,990  -->  00:07:26,000

395

00:07:26,000  -->  00:07:29,860
files and we have our challenge for this

396

00:07:29,860  -->  00:07:29,870

397

00:07:29,870  -->  00:07:32,230
part of the course. It's going to be a

398

00:07:32,230  -->  00:07:32,240

399

00:07:32,240  -->  00:07:33,490
very exciting tutorial, we're going to

400

00:07:33,490  -->  00:07:33,500

401

00:07:33,500  -->  00:07:35,860
talk about some cool analytics so this first part

402

00:07:35,860  -->  00:07:35,870

403

00:07:35,870  -->  00:07:37,420
is going to be all about geographies and

404

00:07:37,420  -->  00:07:37,430

405

00:07:37,430  -->  00:07:39,790
mapping. The second part is going to

406

00:07:39,790  -->  00:07:39,800

407

00:07:39,800  -->  00:07:41,800
delve into some more advanced stuff,

408

00:07:41,800  -->  00:07:41,810

409

00:07:41,810  -->  00:07:44,560
going to talk about clustering and we

410

00:07:44,560  -->  00:07:44,570

411

00:07:44,570  -->  00:07:47,440
also going to about trends or building

412

00:07:47,440  -->  00:07:47,450

413

00:07:47,450  -->  00:07:49,840
for costs are actually recruit like

414

00:07:49,840  -->  00:07:49,850

415

00:07:49,850  -->  00:07:52,330
models regression models on top of

416

00:07:52,330  -->  00:07:52,340

417

00:07:52,340  -->  00:07:54,010
clustering and then we'll also talk

418

00:07:54,010  -->  00:07:54,020

419

00:07:54,020  -->  00:07:57,010
about cross started joins and a few

420

00:07:57,010  -->  00:07:57,020

421

00:07:57,020  -->  00:07:59,170
other things. So exciting challenge ahead

422

00:07:59,170  -->  00:07:59,180

423

00:07:59,180  -->  00:08:01,930
exciting section ahead, I look forward

424

00:08:01,930  -->  00:08:01,940

425

00:08:01,940  -->  00:08:03,879
to seeing you on the tutorials

426

00:08:03,879  -->  00:08:03,889

427

00:08:03,889  -->  00:08:06,640
throughout this section and until next

428

00:08:06,640  -->  00:08:06,650

429

00:08:06,650  -->  00:08:13,000
time, happy analyzing.
