00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.770
Hello and welcome back to the course on tableau.

2
00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:11.310
And today we're downloading and connecting to the dataset that we require for this section.

3
00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:13.990
So let's go ahead and get started with that.

4
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.690
We're going to need a browser and we're going to go to supersize dot com slash tableau.

5
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.090
And if you scroll down to the bottom here there is Section Six tableau calculations more dashboards

6
00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.780
and storytelling.

7
00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.230
And this is where our dataset sits.

8
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.500
It's called the UK bank customers that see a three That's right.

9
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:38.490
We're back to a CSA we file because it's always good to know how to connect to different data sets and

10
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:41.180
practice of different types of files.

11
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.780
And before we download the file I just wanted to say that there is a small caveat here that today's

12
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.140
data set is dummy data for an imaginary bank operating in the UK.

13
00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.690
So you don't have to worry.

14
00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.540
This is not a real customer data.

15
00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:59.370
This is all mockup data created specifically for the purposes of this exercise.

16
00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:07.150
So let's go ahead and download that save link as I'll just put it into my folder.

17
00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:13.110
And now if I open up the folder so I actually already had one so I didn't really need to download.

18
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.340
So there is a file and let's open that up and have a look at what is inside.

19
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.040
So there is Excel.

20
00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.450
I'm going to copy the file into there and now I'll just zoom in a bit.

21
00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.580
I don't need the browser anymore.

22
00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.090
I'll just zoom in a bit here.

23
00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.000
Let's make space for these columns OK.

24
00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:38.670
So we've got customer I.D. the idea of the customer the name of the customer the surname the gender

25
00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:39.970
of the customer.

26
00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:47.040
Age of the customer the region in the UK where they're from or where the branch is located.

27
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.400
So it's either England Northern Ireland Wales or Scotland.

28
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:56.010
The job classification whether they're white collar blue collar or other the date they join the bank.

29
00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.600
So this is a relatively new bank.

30
00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:04.350
It's only been operating for a year for the year of 2015 from January to December.

31
00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:11.820
So that's when all of these customers joined and the balance on the account of the customer in dollars

32
00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.040
or pounds doesn't really matter.

33
00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.140
Just some sort of currency.

34
00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:22.050
And now if we go down to the very bottom here you'll see that there's four thousand and fifteen rows

35
00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.380
actually four thousand fourteen because one rose a header.

36
00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.960
So not a lot of customers relatively new bank.

37
00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:36.030
And what they want us to do is they want us to analyze how the different regions are represented in

38
00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.840
this customer base.

39
00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:44.040
So basically what the customers look like in the different regions so they can assess who is interested

40
00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:50.640
in their bank in these different areas of the UK and how to better service their customers.

41
00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:58.290
So we need to create some visuals a dashboard a and a storyline to actually portray what we want to

42
00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:05.470
tell the executives and explain about the user base so basically all of the findings that we uncover.

43
00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.200
So that's our dataset.

44
00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.810
Let's close this file.

45
00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:15.900
No we don't want to say changes and we will go ahead and connect Tableau to this file.

46
00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:22.890
So this is no longer an Excel file it's a text file because CSP files are deemed text files and we're

47
00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:28.170
going to open up UK bank customers and there we go.

48
00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:34.080
So there is our fault the bottom if we scroll down we'll just to check that everything's okay and the

49
00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.240
total number of rows is correct.

50
00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:37.110
That's good.

51
00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:43.920
And now we can proceed to creating our visualizations that we will require for our analysis.

52
00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:50.220
So that was all for today I look forward to seeing you next time when we will start analyzing the customers

53
00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.510
and creating some cool charts and maps and stuff like that.

54
00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.830
So until next time happy analyzing.
