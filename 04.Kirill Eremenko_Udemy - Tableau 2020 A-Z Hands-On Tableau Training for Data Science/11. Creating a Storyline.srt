1
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:09,620
Welcome back to the course on Tableau in front of us we see the dashboard the beautiful customer segmentation

2
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:14,680
dashboard that we created in the previous tutorials of this course.

3
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:18,640
And today we're going to be putting this dashboard into a storyline.

4
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:26,540
So just to remind you what we have here is a map of the United Kingdom and how a certain bank how its

5
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:30,800
customers are distributed across the different regions of the UK.

6
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:35,210
Also we have a distribution of the same customers by different balance bands.

7
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:39,260
So these are 10000 dollar bands or 10000 pound bands.

8
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:45,260
In this case the distribution of the customers by age so five year bands then we can control the bands

9
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:46,250
here if we like.

10
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:49,310
And as we click around they adjust.

11
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:55,760
And also we've got the gender distribution of our customers and the job classifications.

12
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,100
And once again this dashboard is full interactive.

13
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,180
We can click around.

14
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:05,180
We can see what is going on with the different demographics and that's why it's called a customer segmentation

15
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:06,270
dashboard.

16
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:12,410
So what we're going to do today is as we discuss we're going to put this dashboard into a storyline

17
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:18,080
and provide some insights a story tell the readers or the viewers the people we're going to be presenting

18
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:24,430
to tell them a story about this bank and its customers and how they differ from region to region.

19
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:28,650
However before we proceed with today's tutorial I'd like to ask you for a quick favor.

20
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:34,550
I know you've already brought this up before and if you have left to review thank you thank you so much.

21
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:38,540
However if you haven't I would really appreciate if you considered leaving a review for this course

22
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:43,880
it's very easy to do you just have to click this button up at the top and then in this window you just

23
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:49,010
select the number of stars you think the course deserves and perhaps type in some comments it would

24
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:55,390
really help you understand how you write the course and if it has met your expectations and also it'll

25
00:01:55,400 --> 00:02:02,180
help other students who are considering taking this course to understand what to expect inside and whether

26
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,520
it's worth their while or not.

27
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:06,770
So I would really appreciate if you could do that for me today.

28
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:08,980
And now let's get on back with the show.

29
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:12,500
So how do we create a storyline.

30
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:17,660
Well the first thing we need to do is click this button at the bottom which says new story so we'll

31
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:18,450
do that.

32
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:23,040
And now you can see a new type of working space.

33
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,740
So it's not a worksheet or a dashboard.

34
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:25,910
It's a storyline.

35
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:30,980
What you can do here you can create anything and so but you can drag elements in here and are like a

36
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:35,420
dashboard you can drag worksheets and you can also drag dashboards into a storyline.

37
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,570
But the main difference is that you can only drag one item.

38
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:39,840
You can combine items here.

39
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:45,010
So since you drag a second item it automatically replaces the previous one.

40
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:48,150
And so here we can drag our dashboard in here.

41
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:53,450
You've got to pick what you want to drag into the storyline and then once you've added it.

42
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:59,000
So let's say if I want the map then I can add another point in my story line and add the gender and

43
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,730
then let's say I want the dispersion my balance that way I can create a story and talk through these

44
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:11,600
points one by one but in our case we will be working all the time before segmentation dashboard and

45
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:18,770
we'll just be showing different cuts of our member base in this storyline.

46
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:24,590
So let's go ahead and drag this segmentation dashboard in here and right away you can see it underneath

47
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:29,090
this storyline control panel.

48
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:34,180
So the first element or storyline will be the overall representation of our customers.

49
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:41,630
So it's kind of our customer base line and we want the user or the viewer to be able to see what the

50
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:46,370
bank looks overall in the whole of the United Kingdom as a here we need to add a caption.

51
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:52,380
And what we're going to type in is I've already got to prepare this bank's customer base line.

52
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,080
There we go.

53
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,500
That's done all we want to show our viewer at this stage.

54
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:02,300
Now we're going to create a new point and we're going to drag the segmentation dashboard in here as

55
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,140
well.

56
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:10,130
Now what we want to look at is the one of the regions of the U.K. and we're going to start off the largest

57
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:13,790
region or the region that has most customers for this bank.

58
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:15,180
It's the it's England.

59
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,200
So we'll just click on England here.

60
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:23,180
And as we discussed previously the insight that we want to convey here is that there's a lot of white

61
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:29,150
collar workers in this region predominantly they are represent this region.

62
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:32,890
The customers in this region are represented represented by white collar workers.

63
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:37,750
Perhaps that has something to do with London being the economic center of Europe.

64
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:42,490
So we're going to take a new caption and we'll keep it in here.

65
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:48,940
And it says England is mostly represented by white collar workers 70 percent.

66
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:54,590
That's all we wanted to show so when you do get to this point during a presentation what will happen

67
00:04:54,590 --> 00:05:00,590
is you can start drilling into this dashboard if it is required.

68
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:05,550
So obviously you're talking about white collar workers you might want to click on it and then see how

69
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:11,640
the dashboard changes and perhaps look at what are the male white collar workers up to and look at their

70
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:17,340
representation by age bands and then look at their representation by in the higher and balances and

71
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:18,290
and so on.

72
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:25,590
So it's up to you once you get to this point but to start with to get you started or to create a Segway

73
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:31,270
between the previous slide and this slide you just need this little caption over here.

74
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:37,020
So now we're going to update that so it saves and instead of drawing a blank point we're going to duplicate

75
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:42,550
this chart and that'll save us the trouble of dragging the dashboard.

76
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:43,080
There we go.

77
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:51,180
So we've duplicated the tab and now we will look at Scotland and as we discussed here the age demographic

78
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,470
is completely different.

79
00:05:52,470 --> 00:06:00,630
Much older customers the gender is also different predominantly males and the job classification more

80
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:07,870
blue collar and other very few white collar workers bank with this bank in Scotland.

81
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:12,020
So let's copula caption and see what it says.

82
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:21,180
The caption here is larger so if you move away you'll see this scroll box up here and now we can read

83
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:27,180
the caption says customers in Scotland are predominantly males in their late 40s and early 50s late

84
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,890
40s and early 50s.

85
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:31,440
Representation of white collar workers is low.

86
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:32,260
OK.

87
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:39,120
So that gives us some conversational topics so you might want to click on blue collar workers once you

88
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:43,850
open up this dashboard you'll see that 95 percent of them are actually male.

89
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:46,560
And so the other 44 percent.

90
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,100
These are mostly represented by females.

91
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:55,800
You might also want to look at the older demographics and see how their what their balances are distributed

92
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,420
like and so on.

93
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:00,780
So that is how or what we're going to convey for Scotland.

94
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:05,970
And at this point I'd like to show you another cool feature of Tableau and that is annotations.

95
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:11,760
Now it is a very simple feature and a lot of the time people get to learn it right away so you might

96
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,660
really know it.

97
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:13,840
But if you don't know.

98
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:18,040
Not a worry we'll look at it now it's very easy to use let's say on this chart.

99
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:27,200
I want to point out something specific that there is a lot of workers or customers in this region with

100
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:29,150
in the in their early 50s.

101
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:35,490
So between 50 and 55 years old what I want to do here is right click on this bar click annotate and

102
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:38,780
add a mark and we'll just keep the default for now.

103
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:41,790
So I'll just change a size to 10 because that's a bit too big.

104
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:47,010
And what you'll see is this arrow up here and this box with text which you can move around and it's

105
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:50,510
basically telling the reader some additional information.

106
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:56,730
So once you get to this picture so the slide you will see this annotation which I hadn't seen before.

107
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:03,840
And that is very powerful because it attracts their attention and also gives you some cues talking cues.

108
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:12,330
So what we're going to do is we're going to change the text here and we'll say high representation of

109
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:21,720
customers in early 50s maybe center of this.

110
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:25,710
So that's what we wanted maybe change in a bit.

111
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:27,420
So that word fits.

112
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:35,970
So that attracts attention and gets you can get to talking about this specific element of the customer

113
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:36,650
segmentation.

114
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:43,200
So the age groups you can definitely add them for other elements of your reservation so if you want

115
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:48,390
to talk about balances or gender or something else something that might not be obvious or something

116
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:53,760
that you really want to attract people's attention to then feel free free to add annotations.

117
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:56,760
So we'll just update that and we'll duplicate it again.

118
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:02,100
So now we're moving on to Wales and in Wales we obviously don't need this anymore so we can delete it.

119
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,950
And as you can see it's stayed here but it's deleted here now.

120
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:08,570
In Wales our man inside was the balances.

121
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:14,150
So here you can see something different to the overall baseline.

122
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:17,180
And we will see it even better if we change the balance group.

123
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:22,720
So we're going to justice parameter and change it to fifteen thousand dollar or pound bands.

124
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:28,470
And here you can see that it actually increases first and then drops off so if I'm click Wales in the

125
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:33,120
baseline you'll see that it always drops off like that for Wales at first increases.

126
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:42,020
And so let's type in our Inside for Wales the inside for Wales is going to be data for Wales shows an

127
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:45,650
above average representation of mid-sized balances.

128
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:53,130
There we go so we can update that and perhaps you can add another caption here so on it annotate Mark

129
00:09:53,160 --> 00:10:02,300
and we'll say above average representation and here will say size 10.

130
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:14,030
And also centering it is a good idea sometimes so that's how we will deal with this region.

131
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:18,910
And once you're in here you can start clicking around and understanding what else is going on.

132
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,180
If you need to.

133
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:26,120
So once you click these balances for instance you see that the distribution by age changes so you can

134
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:35,120
tell how these people have an abnormal representation of balances what they are who they are and you

135
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,420
see that they are mostly in their early 30s.

136
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:40,350
They're mostly female and mostly white collar workers.

137
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:43,420
And finally let's move on to Northern Ireland.

138
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:47,670
So we're going to update that and we're going to duplicate.

139
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:54,470
And here we'll get rid of this caption and we will select Northern Ireland right away are inside here

140
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:59,340
was that earlier a younger age groups and predominantly female.

141
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,170
So let's copy that into our caption.

142
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:08,330
Here we typed in Northern Ireland is mostly represented by female customers in younger age groups update

143
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:09,290
that.

144
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:10,480
And there we go.

145
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:16,360
So that's all done we can add another annotation here but I will leave that up to you.

146
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:20,170
Another thing I wanted to show you is that here the parameters are independent.

147
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,540
So tattle has thought this through very well.

148
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:30,980
If you change the parameter control on this element of your storyline then it won't change on this element.

149
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:37,430
So even though it's the same dashboard we're dealing with ultimately the actual parameter controls are

150
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:37,990
independent.

151
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:47,630
So feel free to change them around and show exactly what you want in every single part of your of every

152
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:49,310
single region of the United Kingdom.

153
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:50,920
So you might want to show it like this.

154
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:55,460
In this particular case that is totally up to you.

155
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:56,210
So there we go.

156
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,400
Now what we see is a storyline.

157
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:05,060
So when you're presenting you can start with the UK then you can move on to England and Scotland then

158
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:12,190
Wales make some comments points and move on to Northern Ireland and conclude your presentation.

159
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:19,040
That is how to create storylines in tableau very new powerful feature.

160
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:24,750
Hope you enjoyed this tutorial and just as a reminder I would really appreciate if you could leave a

161
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:25,410
review.

162
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,750
It's very simple to do and it will take you 30 seconds and help me out a lot.

163
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,690
Thank you very much.

164
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:31,830
I look forward to seeing you next time.

165
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:33,750
And until then happy analyzing.
