00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:09,140
Hello and welcome back to the course on Tableau.

2
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:14,470
In today's editorial it will create the remainder of the required of his life nations and use to tips

3
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:16,840
in solving our business challenge.

4
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:18,770
Now we need to create two new sheets.

5
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:21,000
So let's start off with the first one.

6
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:30,040
The first one we will actually call the average annual salary map because that is what we will have

7
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:35,170
on the four counties on the map of New York State.

8
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:40,470
And to do that we quite simply dragged in the county into our map.

9
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:45,580
And yours might look different but if you're also located outside of the United States yours might end

10
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:49,160
up like this having sixty 62 unknown land locations.

11
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:54,280
Now this normally happens when your original settings of your machine or your original settings of Tableau

12
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:59,950
is different to that of the United States when working with a data sets from the United States to fix

13
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:01,330
that is fairly easy.

14
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:06,910
You literally just click on the 62 unknown and edit locations you can also exclude the data by using

15
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:10,030
faulty data that doesn't make sense at all in this case.

16
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:16,270
But to be totally edit locations now then Tableau allows us to change the country which it needs to

17
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:19,540
focus on obviously located in the Netherlands at the moment.

18
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:26,800
So we wait for the Canadians but we will just go to the United States and we will also change the state

19
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:32,710
in the province because we know each of these counties out of all each of them all locate are related

20
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:35,370
to their state of New York.

21
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:41,020
And like magic everything disappears all of the problems and it draws us the map properly.

22
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:46,450
We actually want a filled map so we'll just click on map over there and these are all of our counties

23
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,550
in the state of New York.

24
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:50,180
Now we can continue.

25
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:56,020
We know we want to use the average annual salary as our colouring so we can just right click and drag

26
00:01:56,020 --> 00:02:00,910
that onto color which will open up a field over there because we don't want this sum of annual salary

27
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:04,240
because remember we have all of the figures for every year.

28
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,420
We actually want to then calculate average over all year.

29
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:11,140
So we'll just take on average and I think we can make a few improvements.

30
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:17,050
Firstly the dark lines seem quite daunting so let's change that to white to white borders.

31
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:24,100
We can change also the actual transparency or the capacity to 65 to make it a bit more transparent and

32
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,530
see what goes on in the background.

33
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,780
And furthermore let's also change the color to black Korea always likes to do this is to change the

34
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:32,650
color green.

35
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:34,390
I also preferred like that.

36
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:39,610
And as we've done in the previous tutorial we want to see the names of each of the counties and displayed

37
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:40,450
in a nice way.

38
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:45,940
We can obviously see it on the tooltip but is this better a nice way we can just go again into map layers

39
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:48,630
and switch on the county names.

40
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,720
We don't need the borders.

41
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:54,310
We already have the borders but these are the names in the background map and obviously it shows it

42
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:58,540
for the rest of the counties as well but it doesn't really matter.

43
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:04,390
We can at least see it on our map nicely now and that's this visualization done very nice and quick.

44
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:10,720
Now we can just move that to the first as that's our most important one and we can create our last one.

45
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:16,060
So this is the one where we create the top five industries watch out which way we look at the average

46
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:16,850
annual salary.

47
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:21,260
And you show the top five so it's quite an easy chart again as well.

48
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:25,960
We will take the average annual salary put that in two columns and obviously change that to average

49
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:31,650
making sure we use average and then also take the industry and put that on two rows.

50
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:34,420
We will also use the industry while holding control down.

51
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:40,060
Put that into color and I just actually want to change the color here and make it something a little

52
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:45,400
bit different but more not as striking which is this on the ballot for now we know anything the top

53
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,350
five so we can use that.

54
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:53,110
So there will be a few repeats now but we will take industry once again and put that into filters because

55
00:03:53,110 --> 00:04:00,310
we know we are only looking for the top five let's just top five over there and based on their average

56
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,900
annual salary and there we go.

57
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:07,450
So you can see obviously repeats are gone and the beats of the number of or at least of the industries

58
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:15,130
and we can see the top five overall for all the top five industries for all years in all different counties

59
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,030
in the state of New York.

60
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:24,120
And we can just rename this as well and just call this our top five industries right.

61
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:32,020
And then we can move on to putting it all together using the nice viz intuitive functionality so tableau

62
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:33,010
added this for us.

63
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:35,350
And I think it is just awesome.

64
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:40,330
So you will remember that our client specifically asked not to use a dashboard and to combine these

65
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:44,460
sheets and also not to keep different sheets.

66
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:52,420
And that's why this visit tooltip comes in handy now to add a to a sheet or a different sheet to your

67
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:58,480
visualization in the tooltip you just click on tooltip and obviously just go to the bottom two to added

68
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:03,920
below the text we already have and you would just add it from this insert button over here.

69
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:10,600
And normally we added fields from from there but we see this new option called sheets and now we they

70
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:13,280
we can select the sheets that we've just built.

71
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:15,510
So let's start with a staple line chart.

72
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:21,030
So we just click that and automatically tableau fills out all the required information so you can see

73
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:24,470
it specifies the sheet then the max with the max height.

74
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:30,060
So obviously the space within a tooltip is limited but there it's fair specifies the maximum space that

75
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,340
can be used by default.

76
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:37,350
And then also to make sure that all filters that are applied to our visualization here is also then

77
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:40,020
applied to that specific view.

78
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:47,490
What did that specific sheet say if we hit okay and start dragging a mouse or mouse pointer over the

79
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:54,360
graph you'll see how each county then updates the chart or it gets the joint updated for that specific

80
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,120
county.

81
00:05:55,320 --> 00:06:00,630
Pretty helpful because now we can see specific spikes like that in Fulton County or you know even other

82
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:01,640
spikes in Steuben County.

83
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:06,150
So which we're not visible at all when we looked at them together.

84
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,190
So pretty pretty nice.

85
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:13,950
What we can then also do is add more than one well more than one sheet to this losing tooltip so we

86
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,360
can just click again.

87
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:20,550
Just put it at the bottom over there to say the same approach and add the top five industries you'll

88
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:23,190
see again all the same values are put in there.

89
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:25,610
Obviously the sheet name will be different if.

90
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,220
Okay.

91
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:27,860
Now you see we've got you over there.

92
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:29,590
So that is pretty neat.

93
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:31,600
And that's exactly what we wanted.

94
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,710
But this is obviously not where we'll stop.

95
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:36,190
We need to make some to some fixes on yeah.

96
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:42,120
I think the tooltip is way too big but loses the overall picture and there's information on there which

97
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,730
we don't need so to edit I'll tilt up.

98
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:50,280
I think what we can do is we can just change the maximum size and this is obviously we are able to edit

99
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:50,600
this.

100
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:54,360
So the maximum I'm not gonna change the measurement with apologies.

101
00:06:54,480 --> 00:07:02,370
We changed the maximum height because we want to keep it small and we can also just change these all

102
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:04,770
these headings so we can make that much bigger.

103
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:09,960
So let's call that 18 and just give it a different color it just looks slightly different and we'll

104
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:15,720
just call this our average annual salary like that and we hit apply or wheat.

105
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,230
Okay.

106
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:17,710
And look at that.

107
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,320
She shit.

108
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:18,880
Oh.

109
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:20,220
Sheets are much smaller.

110
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:23,220
You can see the spacing use is a little bit less.

111
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:26,800
And and we've got a nice heading there as well.

112
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:31,380
So to go and edit the Axis use and maybe make the font size a bit smaller.

113
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:38,230
Also on the smaller individual sheets we can just go into each one and as we know we've done this before.

114
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,170
We don't need for instance the title.

115
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:41,330
It's self-explanatory.

116
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,910
And even for a year of a year we don't really need that.

117
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:46,410
So we can just remove all of it.

118
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:51,350
And then next we can just also format and take this to the smaller size possible.

119
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:58,640
And as you can see now it looks way better in terms of the use of space and the same with the top industries

120
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:00,290
we don't need that over there.

121
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:02,870
We can edit the access as we don't need any.

122
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:09,570
Well you'd need a title over there and let's just also make sure that we use the smallest size available

123
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:10,840
in this case.

124
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:14,940
And voila that is our visualization and doesn't that look great.

125
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:20,640
And that also then concludes our tutorials for this section in the next material we will actually be

126
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:25,860
doing a recap of the most important features which we've learned during this section and I look forward

127
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:29,070
to seeing you there until next on happy analyzing.
