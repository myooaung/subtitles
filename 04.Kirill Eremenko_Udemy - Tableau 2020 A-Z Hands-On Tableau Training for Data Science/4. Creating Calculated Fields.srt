00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:07,500
Hello, this is Carol, and welcome back to the course and Tablo.

2
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:12,200
And today we will get to start solving the problem that we have at hand.

3
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:13,310
Who gets a bonus?

4
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:16,870
So we left off here last that we were just playing right out of Tablo.

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:23,840
I hope you had a chance to explore further the different buttons and tools of table has to offer, because

6
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:26,690
the more you play around with it, the better you get at it.

7
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,800
And it happens very quickly because Tablo is very, very intuitive.

8
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:33,770
And that's just we're talking just about the navigation.

9
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:38,240
So, you know, basically where to look for what right now.

10
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:41,360
I'll show you another cool feature is clear the dashboard.

11
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,850
So we don't want any of this.

12
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:46,370
And so there's a button over here, the red one clear sheet.

13
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:49,470
And so we're just going to click that and boyah.

14
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:50,270
Everything is gone.

15
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:57,590
By the way, if you're using the Mac or a MacBook, um, some of these layouts might be a bit different.

16
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:03,500
So just kind of follow along and you will be able to find where they are.

17
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:07,650
But just bear in mind that they might not be in the same exact place as I'm showing.

18
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:15,020
OK, so let's start answering the question where we know that we can create Barchas this create a bar

19
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:18,560
chart for the representatives and see what they've sold.

20
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:23,210
So we want representatives to be kind of in the columns.

21
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:25,820
So there they are, our salespeople.

22
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:30,160
And let's see how many units each one of these represents have sold, has sold.

23
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,120
There we go.

24
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:35,270
So we can see that Richard has sold the most units, which is great.

25
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:45,920
And how about we break it down by region so we know that we have three bonuses, one for every single

26
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:53,420
one of one for the best representative in each region, and like this, we can't really tell who's the

27
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:54,860
best in each of the regions.

28
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:56,390
We could just tell who's the best overall.

29
00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:01,460
So what we're going to do is we're going to take region and we're going to drag it into columns, but

30
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:03,760
we're going to put it before representative.

31
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,890
So as you can see, I'm doing here and I'm just going to let go.

32
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:08,570
And what does that do?

33
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:16,040
Well, it gives us a kind of another level on top of our representatives.

34
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:21,430
So first, the chart is broken down by regions so that you can see that here.

35
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,700
So I'm just going to make this a bit smaller so I can zoom in.

36
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:29,870
So here you can see that the chart is broken down central, east and west.

37
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:35,180
And then inside every region is broken down into by representative.

38
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:41,840
And so that way we can easily tell who's the best in sales in each of the regions.

39
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,620
So here it's Alex, here it's Richard.

40
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,710
Here's James.

41
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:48,500
And so now another cool feature.

42
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:52,850
You can order these bars by their size.

43
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:58,340
So if you see this little button here, so when you come roll over the axis, this this little one here.

44
00:02:58,350 --> 00:02:59,360
So if you click that.

45
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:06,940
Automatically, they're sorted by side, so you can see how it drops off and you'd think that this answers

46
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:14,950
our question, but in reality, no, it doesn't, because units is actually the number of items that

47
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:15,520
has been sold.

48
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:23,610
But as we know, our representatives are actually measured based on the dollar value of their sales.

49
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,580
And so we need to find out the dollar value.

50
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:32,150
But as far as you can see here, there's no actual dollar value, total dollar value of sales.

51
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:32,650
We know that.

52
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:39,520
And it's really, really easy to find it or to see that because all of our numbers are kept in measures.

53
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,740
So we don't even have to look here.

54
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:46,750
We can see here that we only have units and we only have unit price and we have some of these other

55
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:50,770
fields which we will talk about further down the course.

56
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:56,890
But like the ones from our data, our units and unit price, and there's no total dollar value.

57
00:03:56,890 --> 00:04:00,290
And that means that we have to create that total dollar value.

58
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:01,510
How do we do that?

59
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,860
Well, it's quite easy.

60
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:10,300
You just have to multiply the number of units the representative representative had sold by the total

61
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,570
unit price for those units.

62
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:14,800
So if I click our daughter here, I go to view data.

63
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:22,510
You can see here that when, for instance, Nick sold Binder's, he sold twenty nine binder's at the

64
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:25,150
price of one dollar ninety nine cents each.

65
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:33,460
So the total revenue from that sale would be twenty nine times one point ninety nine dollars, making

66
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:38,120
it somewhere around fifty dollars for that sale.

67
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:45,670
So we need to calculate that multiplied value and apparently it's not president database or in our dataset.

68
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,030
So let's go ahead and do do this in Tablo.

69
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:51,150
And this is where we talk about creating calculated fields.

70
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:52,720
So you have to do is right.

71
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,630
Click on measures, create calculated field.

72
00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:06,430
And we'll call it total sales, and here we will call we will take unit price or units and we will multiply

73
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:08,350
units by unit price.

74
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,300
OK, so now we have a total sales value.

75
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:16,870
And as you can see, there's a little equal sign before the hashtag.

76
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:18,380
That means it's a calculated field.

77
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:24,070
So what we're going to do now is we're going to take total sales and we will drag it onto a chart to

78
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,620
replace the units.

79
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,900
So I'll just drag it exactly on top.

80
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:32,680
And as you can see, Tableau picks it up and aggregates it just as it did with unit.

81
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:37,990
Other way to do it is you can take this one off, remove it and then take total sales and put it on

82
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:39,760
where you need to be.

83
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,610
And so now we have some total sales.

84
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:49,470
And now if we order by this value, you will see that we have a different picture.

85
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:53,430
Now, Richard is no longer the best seller overall.

86
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,630
Susan beat him in the east region.

87
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:58,230
Mathew's the best in the central region.

88
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:01,280
And James James is still the best in the west region.

89
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:04,900
So now we know who has deserved the bonus.

90
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,060
It's Matthew, Susan and James.

91
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:12,130
And that was an example of how to create a calculated field in Tableau.

92
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:13,890
Hope you enjoyed that.

93
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:17,690
And I look forward to seeing you next time when we will be talking about colors.

94
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,200
Until then, happy analyzing.
