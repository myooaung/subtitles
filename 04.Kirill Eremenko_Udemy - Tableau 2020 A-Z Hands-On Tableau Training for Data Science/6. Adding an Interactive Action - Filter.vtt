00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:09.580
Hello and welcome back to the course on Tableau and into this trial we will learn how to make our dashboard

2
00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:10.440
interactive.

3
00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:11.980
So what do you mean by that.

4
00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:18.430
Well what we want to do is we want to allow the user of this dashboard to drill into certain parts of

5
00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:20.350
the dashboard by just simply clicking on it.

6
00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:28.210
So for instance if the user wants to drill into certain state like Il de France for instance he can

7
00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:35.650
just simply click on this bubble and then the customers scatter plot will automatically adjust to reflect

8
00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:43.520
only the customers that live in that state and the same thing goes for any other state because that

9
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:49.340
will add a lot of value to this dashboard and to the users who are going to be using it because they'll

10
00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:55.650
be able to analyze difference geographical regions individually and separately.

11
00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.920
So let's see how we can do that in order to do that we need to add an action and then tableau there

12
00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.420
are two main types of actions are called filtering and highlighting.

13
00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:12.970
So let's go to the dashboard dropdown here and we'll click action here you can see that if you want

14
00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.840
to add action you can choose between filter highlight.

15
00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:22.090
There's also third action called Your URL which will take your church and link but we won't be looking

16
00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:23.890
at that for now.

17
00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:29.650
Instead of adding an action here right now what we will do is we will add an automatic action which

18
00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:34.890
is much easier and that will help us slowly get into this topic of actions.

19
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:41.900
So what are we going to do at the top of map of Europe will look click this dropdown and we will select

20
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.510
the menu which is called user's filter.

21
00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.240
So as soon as you click that it's all done.

22
00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:52.250
So now as soon as I click on il de France you will see that the scatter plot has been adjusted.

23
00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.800
If I click on England it's also been adjusted.

24
00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.040
I click on Netherlands right away you can see it's just that.

25
00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:09.100
So as you can see I am able to now very easily select different states and see what's going on in each

26
00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:15.610
one of these states so that is a very handy way to analyze data.

27
00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:16.730
So what exactly happened.

28
00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.470
Let's have a look in more detail.

29
00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.990
Now if we go to dashboard and we go to actions you will see that there is an action here already and

30
00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:27.400
it's generated action meaning it was added automatically.

31
00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.760
Now let's click on this generated action and we'll click edit.

32
00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.500
So here you can see that there is a few fields.

33
00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.580
First of all what is the source of the action.

34
00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.330
Dashboard one is our dashboard that we're looking at.

35
00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.170
And in dashboard one it is map of Europe.

36
00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.210
That is the source of the action.

37
00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:45.830
The action is run.

38
00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.310
Only when you select a certain element.

39
00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:54.920
And once you've selected an element the action is applied to the target sheets the target sheets are

40
00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.250
the customers scatter plot and the map of Europe once again.

41
00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.830
So in this case what is going to do is it's going to filter the customers scatter plot.

42
00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:08.690
It won't actually take out the rest of the values from the map of Europe because tableau smart it knows

43
00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:13.640
that if you take out the rest of the values from the map of Europe then you won't be able to click on

44
00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:14.750
something else.

45
00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.200
So let's have a look at that again.

46
00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.150
I click OK.

47
00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.600
And now once I'm selecting as you can see this is the source of the action.

48
00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.700
And these two are the targets of the action.

49
00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:31.940
So in this case the customers scatter plot being the new worksheet is being filtered.

50
00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:38.930
So whether I click through the states these customers are own only the customers that live in that state

51
00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:39.950
are being left.

52
00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.180
So now what we're going to do is we're going to go to dashboards.

53
00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.980
We'll go back to actions and we'll adjust the sections to have a play around with it.

54
00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:54.020
Now instead of a select let's choose hover what that will do is the action will be applied as soon as

55
00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:57.890
we hover over a dot on our map.

56
00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:59.270
So let's see how that works click.

57
00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.050
OK OK.

58
00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:05.830
And now let's hover over some of the states as you can see our dashboard.

59
00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:11.780
I'm not clicking anything and the dashboard is being adjusted right away as we're just hovering over.

60
00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:18.050
And that is another way that you can present your dashboards it might be more convenient in certain

61
00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:27.620
cases for you to be just required to just hover over these bubbles to get the second worksheet to adjust

62
00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:28.970
itself.

63
00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:35.030
Now let's look at the last option that we had there if we go to dashboard actions and we click Edit

64
00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:42.380
Or we select menu what will happen is instead of adjusting the dashboard right away we are presenting

65
00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:48.170
a menu where we can toggle the dashboard ourselves manually.

66
00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:52.210
But personally I don't use that often.

67
00:04:52.220 --> 00:05:00.380
So now let's do some more other things so forget dashboard actions EDIT Let's leave it at select and

68
00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:01.940
let's explore this part of the dashboard.

69
00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:04.950
So what happens when we clear this election.

70
00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:07.820
Well we can either show old values which is happening now.

71
00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:12.950
So once we click somewhere else on the map all values are returned.

72
00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:14.830
What we can do is leave the filter.

73
00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.100
So let's have a look at that.

74
00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:17.810
So click OK.

75
00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:24.080
And now if I select a state and a necklace somewhere else as you can see all the states are shown again.

76
00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.210
But the filter is stays on.

77
00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:33.530
So if I click somewhere else and I click back once again the filter does not is not removed which is

78
00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:37.080
probably not a good thing in this case because it is misleading.

79
00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:42.020
It looks like all the states are selected but in reality not all the customers are shown.

80
00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:44.540
So let's change that.

81
00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:47.690
Go to edit and you can also do exclude values.

82
00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:50.420
So have a look at that in your own time.

83
00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:53.830
It basically just will exclude all the values from your scatter plot.

84
00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.400
So we'll just click and leave it back on shore.

85
00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:58.410
All values click OK.

86
00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:03.110
And as soon as we select something on selected we once again have all values.

87
00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:05.140
So two more things that I wanted to show.

88
00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:10.510
The first one is how you create can create that specific filter on your own.

89
00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:13.840
So let's go to dashboard actions and we'll delete this filter.

90
00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:14.460
Remove it.

91
00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:15.400
OK.

92
00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:22.250
So once again now you can see that once I click and nothing happens the scatter plot is not adjusted.

93
00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:24.770
If I go to dashboard I want to add the filter on my own.

94
00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:29.930
I go to actions I want to add action filter here.

95
00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:33.480
The source of our filter is a map of Europe.

96
00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:43.240
We can call our filter and select geography because we want to call select stead because we might want

97
00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:49.990
to change our dashboard and show it at the city level one day it'll be a select type of filter and show

98
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.550
all values upon clearing the filter and those two are the target sheets.

99
00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:55.550
OK.

100
00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:56.540
OK.

101
00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:57.280
And there you go.

102
00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:01.690
Now it's all working and we created that filter all on our own.

103
00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:03.070
So that's that's great.

104
00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:05.850
That's how you create actions manually.

105
00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:12.520
And the next thing I wanted to show you is that you can actually select multiple regions so I can select

106
00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:13.250
two or three.

107
00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:19.870
I'm just coding control on my keyboard and I can select many or I can use the multiple select feature

108
00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:20.720
here in tableau.

109
00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:23.740
So say a rectangular selection.

110
00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:31.840
And here I've got the customers shown for all of those states or I can do a circular selection say I

111
00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:32.650
want to select

112
00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:43.800
so here I can select these customers or a grade one which I like is this free form selection.

113
00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:49.060
So let's say I want to select all the people that are in France in the French states.

114
00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:50.560
And there you go.

115
00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:55.890
I've just selected everybody in France as easy as that and now I can analyze the customers that live

116
00:07:55.890 --> 00:07:56.930
in France.

117
00:07:56.970 --> 00:08:06.090
So that is how you create action filters in tableau dashboards and that is also how you can select many

118
00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:12.330
points on your map and in the next sartorial we will talk about the action which is highlighting and

119
00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:18.630
we will look at why highlighting is a bit different to filters and what the intricacies are there have

120
00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:21.120
a play around with that and I look forward to seeing you next time.

121
00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:22.800
Until then happy analyzing.
