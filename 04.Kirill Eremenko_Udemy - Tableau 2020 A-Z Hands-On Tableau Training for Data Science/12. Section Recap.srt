00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:07,070
Hello and welcome back to the course on

2

00:00:07,070  -->  00:00:07,080

3

00:00:07,080  -->  00:00:09,049
Tableau. In today's tutorial we're going

4

00:00:09,049  -->  00:00:09,059

5

00:00:09,059  -->  00:00:10,730
to recap on what we learned in this

6

00:00:10,730  -->  00:00:10,740

7

00:00:10,740  -->  00:00:12,770
section, I felt that we learned quite a

8

00:00:12,770  -->  00:00:12,780

9

00:00:12,780  -->  00:00:14,839
few new techniques and that would be

10

00:00:14,839  -->  00:00:14,849

11

00:00:14,849  -->  00:00:17,060
very handy for us to have this recap

12

00:00:17,060  -->  00:00:17,070

13

00:00:17,070  -->  00:00:19,160
tutorial so you can always return back

14

00:00:19,160  -->  00:00:19,170

15

00:00:19,170  -->  00:00:21,500
to it and just check what exactly we

16

00:00:21,500  -->  00:00:21,510

17

00:00:21,510  -->  00:00:24,620
learned and I see where you can find the

18

00:00:24,620  -->  00:00:24,630

19

00:00:24,630  -->  00:00:25,939
right knowledge that you might be

20

00:00:25,939  -->  00:00:25,949

21

00:00:25,949  -->  00:00:28,640
needing in your analytics or data

22

00:00:28,640  -->  00:00:28,650

23

00:00:28,650  -->  00:00:31,370
science career, but before we do recap I

24

00:00:31,370  -->  00:00:31,380

25

00:00:31,380  -->  00:00:32,959
would like to ask you for a quick favor

26

00:00:32,959  -->  00:00:32,969

27

00:00:32,969  -->  00:00:35,030
I would really appreciate if you could

28

00:00:35,030  -->  00:00:35,040

29

00:00:35,040  -->  00:00:38,360
rate at this course and maybe even leave

30

00:00:38,360  -->  00:00:38,370

31

00:00:38,370  -->  00:00:41,060
a written review for it, to rate the

32

00:00:41,060  -->  00:00:41,070

33

00:00:41,070  -->  00:00:42,500
course, all you have to do is click the button

34

00:00:42,500  -->  00:00:42,510

35

00:00:42,510  -->  00:00:44,540
up at the top which says rate the course

36

00:00:44,540  -->  00:00:44,550

37

00:00:44,550  -->  00:00:47,330
and then if you have some time I would

38

00:00:47,330  -->  00:00:47,340

39

00:00:47,340  -->  00:00:49,160
really appreciate a quick written

40

00:00:49,160  -->  00:00:49,170

41

00:00:49,170  -->  00:00:51,590
review. This would really help me out and

42

00:00:51,590  -->  00:00:51,600

43

00:00:51,600  -->  00:00:53,959
moreover help the other students that

44

00:00:53,959  -->  00:00:53,969

45

00:00:53,969  -->  00:00:55,369
are considering this course to

46

00:00:55,369  -->  00:00:55,379

47

00:00:55,379  -->  00:00:57,229
understand whether this course is worth

48

00:00:57,229  -->  00:00:57,239

49

00:00:57,239  -->  00:00:59,630
their while or not. So even if you

50

00:00:59,630  -->  00:00:59,640

51

00:00:59,640  -->  00:01:01,970
received some value from this course

52

00:01:01,970  -->  00:01:01,980

53

00:01:01,980  -->  00:01:03,889
already, even if you haven't seen the

54

00:01:03,889  -->  00:01:03,899

55

00:01:03,899  -->  00:01:06,140
whole course entirely but you feel that

56

00:01:06,140  -->  00:01:06,150

57

00:01:06,150  -->  00:01:08,420
you received some value leave a note and

58

00:01:08,420  -->  00:01:08,430

59

00:01:08,430  -->  00:01:10,580
let us know what you thought of the

60

00:01:10,580  -->  00:01:10,590

61

00:01:10,590  -->  00:01:13,820
course. And now moving on with our show,

62

00:01:13,820  -->  00:01:13,830

63

00:01:13,830  -->  00:01:16,580
so what did we learn in this section.

64

00:01:16,580  -->  00:01:16,590

65

00:01:16,590  -->  00:01:17,840
Well in this section, we learned quite a

66

00:01:17,840  -->  00:01:17,850

67

00:01:17,850  -->  00:01:19,880
lot of things. In this section we learned

68

00:01:19,880  -->  00:01:19,890

69

00:01:19,890  -->  00:01:21,530
first of all how to create custom

70

00:01:21,530  -->  00:01:21,540

71

00:01:21,540  -->  00:01:23,690
territories by groups, so that was the

72

00:01:23,690  -->  00:01:23,700

73

00:01:23,700  -->  00:01:26,450
first way we learn how to create custom

74

00:01:26,450  -->  00:01:26,460

75

00:01:26,460  -->  00:01:28,520
territories and was a very direct

76

00:01:28,520  -->  00:01:28,530

77

00:01:28,530  -->  00:01:29,719
approach where you select that

78

00:01:29,719  -->  00:01:29,729

79

00:01:29,729  -->  00:01:31,640
geographical objects that you want in

80

00:01:31,640  -->  00:01:31,650

81

00:01:31,650  -->  00:01:33,740
your custom territory directly on the

82

00:01:33,740  -->  00:01:33,750

83

00:01:33,750  -->  00:01:35,420
map and then you just to create a group

84

00:01:35,420  -->  00:01:35,430

85

00:01:35,430  -->  00:01:37,580
from them and that allows you to create

86

00:01:37,580  -->  00:01:37,590

87

00:01:37,590  -->  00:01:38,929
that custom territory.

88

00:01:38,929  -->  00:01:38,939

89

00:01:38,939  -->  00:01:40,940
The second approach was how to create

90

00:01:40,940  -->  00:01:40,950

91

00:01:40,950  -->  00:01:43,399
custom territories by geographic roles.

92

00:01:43,399  -->  00:01:43,409

93

00:01:43,409  -->  00:01:46,340
So this was more of a process based

94

00:01:46,340  -->  00:01:46,350

95

00:01:46,350  -->  00:01:48,530
approach where you have some steps that

96

00:01:48,530  -->  00:01:48,540

97

00:01:48,540  -->  00:01:51,440
you need to perform so you go into your variable

98

00:01:51,440  -->  00:01:51,450

99

00:01:51,450  -->  00:01:54,260
that you want to use as your custom

100

00:01:54,260  -->  00:01:54,270

101

00:01:54,270  -->  00:01:56,899
territory and then you select, you create

102

00:01:56,899  -->  00:01:56,909

103

00:01:56,909  -->  00:01:59,749
a geographic role for it using another

104

00:01:59,749  -->  00:01:59,759

105

00:01:59,759  -->  00:02:01,249
variable that's present in your data set.

106

00:02:01,249  -->  00:02:01,259

107

00:02:01,259  -->  00:02:04,399
Also a very handy approach, both of them

108

00:02:04,399  -->  00:02:04,409

109

00:02:04,409  -->  00:02:06,170
are very powerful. They achieve the same

110

00:02:06,170  -->  00:02:06,180

111

00:02:06,180  -->  00:02:07,850
result but they just different

112

00:02:07,850  -->  00:02:07,860

113

00:02:07,860  -->  00:02:09,740
methodologies so depends on what your

114

00:02:09,740  -->  00:02:09,750

115

00:02:09,750  -->  00:02:11,930
situation is and exactly what type of

116

00:02:11,930  -->  00:02:11,940

117

00:02:11,940  -->  00:02:13,490
analysis you're performing. You

118

00:02:13,490  -->  00:02:13,500

119

00:02:13,500  -->  00:02:15,620
choose one of the other. Then we talked about

120

00:02:15,620  -->  00:02:15,630

121

00:02:15,630  -->  00:02:17,810
how to use highlighters in Tableau so

122

00:02:17,810  -->  00:02:17,820

123

00:02:17,820  -->  00:02:19,490
highlighters are kind of like filters

124

00:02:19,490  -->  00:02:19,500

125

00:02:19,500  -->  00:02:21,860
but they're not actually filter. So they

126

00:02:21,860  -->  00:02:21,870

127

00:02:21,870  -->  00:02:24,110
are a way to highlight data on your

128

00:02:24,110  -->  00:02:24,120

129

00:02:24,120  -->  00:02:26,540
charts without interfering with

130

00:02:26,540  -->  00:02:26,550

131

00:02:26,550  -->  00:02:28,430
the chart itself. Without changing the colors,

132

00:02:28,430  -->  00:02:28,440

133

00:02:28,440  -->  00:02:31,040
Without changing the shapes or sizes or

134

00:02:31,040  -->  00:02:31,050

135

00:02:31,050  -->  00:02:33,410
anything, you can very subtly add a

136

00:02:33,410  -->  00:02:33,420

137

00:02:33,420  -->  00:02:36,830
highlighter to perform some quick

138

00:02:36,830  -->  00:02:36,840

139

00:02:36,840  -->  00:02:39,020
analytics right on the chart. So that

140

00:02:39,020  -->  00:02:39,030

141

00:02:39,030  -->  00:02:41,090
this is more of a data investigation,

142

00:02:41,090  -->  00:02:41,100

143

00:02:41,100  -->  00:02:43,730
data interrogation type of technique where

144

00:02:43,730  -->  00:02:43,740

145

00:02:43,740  -->  00:02:46,160
you can very quickly highlight the

146

00:02:46,160  -->  00:02:46,170

147

00:02:46,170  -->  00:02:48,050
different categories that you're after.

148

00:02:48,050  -->  00:02:48,060

149

00:02:48,060  -->  00:02:50,300
Then we talked about how to perform

150

00:02:50,300  -->  00:02:50,310

151

00:02:50,310  -->  00:02:52,940
clustering analysis in Tableau and here

152

00:02:52,940  -->  00:02:52,950

153

00:02:52,950  -->  00:02:54,680
in tableau is actually underlined

154

00:02:54,680  -->  00:02:54,690

155

00:02:54,690  -->  00:02:57,260
because in older versions of Tableau, you

156

00:02:57,260  -->  00:02:57,270

157

00:02:57,270  -->  00:03:00,410
would need to link a tool such as for

158

00:03:00,410  -->  00:03:00,420

159

00:03:00,420  -->  00:03:02,600
instance are the programming language of

160

00:03:02,600  -->  00:03:02,610

161

00:03:02,610  -->  00:03:04,880
R, in order to perform this clustering

162

00:03:04,880  -->  00:03:04,890

163

00:03:04,890  -->  00:03:07,070
analysis. Now finally this clusterring

164

00:03:07,070  -->  00:03:07,080

165

00:03:07,080  -->  00:03:08,900
analysis is available directly in

166

00:03:08,900  -->  00:03:08,910

167

00:03:08,910  -->  00:03:11,600
Tableau and as you can see it is a very

168

00:03:11,600  -->  00:03:11,610

169

00:03:11,610  -->  00:03:13,910
very powerful feature which allows you

170

00:03:13,910  -->  00:03:13,920

171

00:03:13,920  -->  00:03:17,630
to very quickly derive insights from

172

00:03:17,630  -->  00:03:17,640

173

00:03:17,640  -->  00:03:19,610
your data based on some sort of

174

00:03:19,610  -->  00:03:19,620

175

00:03:19,620  -->  00:03:21,650
variables that you want to be included

176

00:03:21,650  -->  00:03:21,660

177

00:03:21,660  -->  00:03:24,500
in that clustering analytics. Then we

178

00:03:24,500  -->  00:03:24,510

179

00:03:24,510  -->  00:03:26,030
also looked at how to use domain

180

00:03:26,030  -->  00:03:26,040

181

00:03:26,040  -->  00:03:27,860
knowledge to add external data sets into

182

00:03:27,860  -->  00:03:27,870

183

00:03:27,870  -->  00:03:30,020
your analysis as you recall we were

184

00:03:30,020  -->  00:03:30,030

185

00:03:30,030  -->  00:03:32,330
talking about a startup that deals with

186

00:03:32,330  -->  00:03:32,340

187

00:03:32,340  -->  00:03:34,400
people and specifically deals with

188

00:03:34,400  -->  00:03:34,410

189

00:03:34,410  -->  00:03:36,770
helping out them with their laundry. So

190

00:03:36,770  -->  00:03:36,780

191

00:03:36,780  -->  00:03:38,479
therefore we thought that a good idea

192

00:03:38,479  -->  00:03:38,489

193

00:03:38,489  -->  00:03:42,020
would be to add population into the mix

194

00:03:42,020  -->  00:03:42,030

195

00:03:42,030  -->  00:03:45,110
and see how that affects our analytics

196

00:03:45,110  -->  00:03:45,120

197

00:03:45,120  -->  00:03:47,030
and the insights that we can drive and

198

00:03:47,030  -->  00:03:47,040

199

00:03:47,040  -->  00:03:48,380
in order to do that we had to create a

200

00:03:48,380  -->  00:03:48,390

201

00:03:48,390  -->  00:03:51,170
cross database join which is also

202

00:03:51,170  -->  00:03:51,180

203

00:03:51,180  -->  00:03:52,699
another powerful feature you can create

204

00:03:52,699  -->  00:03:52,709

205

00:03:52,709  -->  00:03:54,979
these joints across different sorts of

206

00:03:54,979  -->  00:03:54,989

207

00:03:54,989  -->  00:03:58,100
databases or datasets for example excel,

208

00:03:58,100  -->  00:03:58,110

209

00:03:58,110  -->  00:04:03,470
SQL and csv files, mySQL lots of

210

00:04:03,470  -->  00:04:03,480

211

00:04:03,480  -->  00:04:05,630
different databases and data sets. Of

212

00:04:05,630  -->  00:04:05,640

213

00:04:05,640  -->  00:04:07,610
course there are some restrictions and

214

00:04:07,610  -->  00:04:07,620

215

00:04:07,620  -->  00:04:10,400
hopefully the Tableau team will keep

216

00:04:10,400  -->  00:04:10,410

217

00:04:10,410  -->  00:04:12,800
creating a more and more possibilities

218

00:04:12,800  -->  00:04:12,810

219

00:04:12,810  -->  00:04:14,930
for us in that sense, but already you can

220

00:04:14,930  -->  00:04:14,940

221

00:04:14,940  -->  00:04:17,900
perform a lot of different joins even

222

00:04:17,900  -->  00:04:17,910

223

00:04:17,910  -->  00:04:19,550
across different databases which is a

224

00:04:19,550  -->  00:04:19,560

225

00:04:19,560  -->  00:04:21,979
great thing to have.

226

00:04:21,979  -->  00:04:21,989

227

00:04:21,989  -->  00:04:23,719
Then we talked about how to combine a

228

00:04:23,719  -->  00:04:23,729

229

00:04:23,729  -->  00:04:25,680
regression modeling and

230

00:04:25,680  -->  00:04:25,690

231

00:04:25,690  -->  00:04:28,800
clustering also a very powerful

232

00:04:28,800  -->  00:04:28,810

233

00:04:28,810  -->  00:04:31,320
technique when you combine these two

234

00:04:31,320  -->  00:04:31,330

235

00:04:31,330  -->  00:04:33,720
approaches to analytics as we can see we

236

00:04:33,720  -->  00:04:33,730

237

00:04:33,730  -->  00:04:35,400
derive some very powerful instance and

238

00:04:35,400  -->  00:04:35,410

239

00:04:35,410  -->  00:04:37,230
we were able to solve the business

240

00:04:37,230  -->  00:04:37,240

241

00:04:37,240  -->  00:04:40,050
challenge at hand. And finally we talked

242

00:04:40,050  -->  00:04:40,060

243

00:04:40,060  -->  00:04:42,150
about how to save clusters for further

244

00:04:42,150  -->  00:04:42,160

245

00:04:42,160  -->  00:04:44,160
analytics, so once you've created the

246

00:04:44,160  -->  00:04:44,170

247

00:04:44,170  -->  00:04:46,530
clusters it is always very handy to have

248

00:04:46,530  -->  00:04:46,540

249

00:04:46,540  -->  00:04:49,350
them as a group on your dimensions shelf

250

00:04:49,350  -->  00:04:49,360

251

00:04:49,360  -->  00:04:51,300
so you can always later bring it into

252

00:04:51,300  -->  00:04:51,310

253

00:04:51,310  -->  00:04:53,760
your analysis and see how those clusters

254

00:04:53,760  -->  00:04:53,770

255

00:04:53,770  -->  00:04:56,070
or how those categories that you've

256

00:04:56,070  -->  00:04:56,080

257

00:04:56,080  -->  00:04:58,680
created through the clusters affect the

258

00:04:58,680  -->  00:04:58,690

259

00:04:58,690  -->  00:05:00,780
other insights that you're driving from

260

00:05:00,780  -->  00:05:00,790

261

00:05:00,790  -->  00:05:04,020
your analytics and hopefully you enjoyed

262

00:05:04,020  -->  00:05:04,030

263

00:05:04,030  -->  00:05:06,000
this section of the course. Please don't

264

00:05:06,000  -->  00:05:06,010

265

00:05:06,010  -->  00:05:07,590
forget to leave a review I would really

266

00:05:07,590  -->  00:05:07,600

267

00:05:07,600  -->  00:05:09,330
appreciate if you could do this for me

268

00:05:09,330  -->  00:05:09,340

269

00:05:09,340  -->  00:05:11,790
today and I look forward to seeing you

270

00:05:11,790  -->  00:05:11,800

271

00:05:11,800  -->  00:05:12,570
next time.

272

00:05:12,570  -->  00:05:12,580

273

00:05:12,580  -->  00:05:18,990
Until then, happy analyzing.
