00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:07,820
Hello and welcome back and today we're

2

00:00:07,820  -->  00:00:07,830

3

00:00:07,830  -->  00:00:10,190
talking about types of joins. Now joins

4

00:00:10,190  -->  00:00:10,200

5

00:00:10,200  -->  00:00:11,780
are operations that are performed on

6

00:00:11,780  -->  00:00:11,790

7

00:00:11,790  -->  00:00:15,410
tables in relational databases. So you

8

00:00:15,410  -->  00:00:15,420

9

00:00:15,420  -->  00:00:18,710
would perform them in SQL, microsoft SQL

10

00:00:18,710  -->  00:00:18,720

11

00:00:18,720  -->  00:00:23,179
and Oracle in Mysql in many different

12

00:00:23,179  -->  00:00:23,189

13

00:00:23,189  -->  00:00:25,790
platforms where the data is stored

14

00:00:25,790  -->  00:00:25,800

15

00:00:25,800  -->  00:00:29,240
in a structured format. So let's have a

16

00:00:29,240  -->  00:00:29,250

17

00:00:29,250  -->  00:00:31,250
look at some joins and understand how

18

00:00:31,250  -->  00:00:31,260

19

00:00:31,260  -->  00:00:33,410
exactly they work. To start off with

20

00:00:33,410  -->  00:00:33,420

21

00:00:33,420  -->  00:00:34,729
let's assume that we have two tables,

22

00:00:34,729  -->  00:00:34,739

23

00:00:34,739  -->  00:00:37,970
table A and table B, and in our example

24

00:00:37,970  -->  00:00:37,980

25

00:00:37,980  -->  00:00:40,130
table A will have the following rows.

26

00:00:40,130  -->  00:00:40,140

27

00:00:40,140  -->  00:00:43,400
It's got three columns, customer, gender &amp;

28

00:00:43,400  -->  00:00:43,410

29

00:00:43,410  -->  00:00:45,860
age and is basically a table that is

30

00:00:45,860  -->  00:00:45,870

31

00:00:45,870  -->  00:00:48,020
describing our customers. So we've got

32

00:00:48,020  -->  00:00:48,030

33

00:00:48,030  -->  00:00:50,330
five customers Adam, Benjamin, Jack, Nick and

34

00:00:50,330  -->  00:00:50,340

35

00:00:50,340  -->  00:00:52,939
Susan. We've got their genders listed and

36

00:00:52,939  -->  00:00:52,949

37

00:00:52,949  -->  00:00:57,080
their ages. Now if we go to table B, it's

38

00:00:57,080  -->  00:00:57,090

39

00:00:57,090  -->  00:00:59,840
a table of employees of a certain store

40

00:00:59,840  -->  00:00:59,850

41

00:00:59,850  -->  00:01:02,389
of our store basically so it's got the

42

00:01:02,389  -->  00:01:02,399

43

00:01:02,399  -->  00:01:04,490
employee name, the title and the wage

44

00:01:04,490  -->  00:01:04,500

45

00:01:04,500  -->  00:01:07,550
and so what we're going to try and do is

46

00:01:07,550  -->  00:01:07,560

47

00:01:07,560  -->  00:01:09,649
we're going to try and find out which of

48

00:01:09,649  -->  00:01:09,659

49

00:01:09,659  -->  00:01:12,530
our customers are also our employees. So

50

00:01:12,530  -->  00:01:12,540

51

00:01:12,540  -->  00:01:15,410
basically where, where do we have

52

00:01:15,410  -->  00:01:15,420

53

00:01:15,420  -->  00:01:19,100
matching rows in these two tables? And

54

00:01:19,100  -->  00:01:19,110

55

00:01:19,110  -->  00:01:21,109
how we're going to do that? Well

56

00:01:21,109  -->  00:01:21,119

57

00:01:21,119  -->  00:01:22,789
basically if we look at the tables, we can

58

00:01:22,789  -->  00:01:22,799

59

00:01:22,799  -->  00:01:25,039
see right away that Jack and Susan both

60

00:01:25,039  -->  00:01:25,049

61

00:01:25,049  -->  00:01:26,929
appear in the customer and in the

62

00:01:26,929  -->  00:01:26,939

63

00:01:26,939  -->  00:01:29,510
employee tables. So how do we do this

64

00:01:29,510  -->  00:01:29,520

65

00:01:29,520  -->  00:01:32,240
from an SQL perspective for basically

66

00:01:32,240  -->  00:01:32,250

67

00:01:32,250  -->  00:01:34,999
from a joining perspective?

68

00:01:34,999  -->  00:01:35,009

69

00:01:35,009  -->  00:01:37,550
Well if we start off with an inner join

70

00:01:37,550  -->  00:01:37,560

71

00:01:37,560  -->  00:01:40,370
then let's have a look at how it will

72

00:01:40,370  -->  00:01:40,380

73

00:01:40,380  -->  00:01:44,480
work. An inner join will take the two

74

00:01:44,480  -->  00:01:44,490

75

00:01:44,490  -->  00:01:47,420
tables and it will look at only their

76

00:01:47,420  -->  00:01:47,430

77

00:01:47,430  -->  00:01:49,880
intersect. So basically if join in our

78

00:01:49,880  -->  00:01:49,890

79

00:01:49,890  -->  00:01:54,020
tables on customer equals employee then

80

00:01:54,020  -->  00:01:54,030

81

00:01:54,030  -->  00:01:56,420
and it's an inner join then the

82

00:01:56,420  -->  00:01:56,430

83

00:01:56,430  -->  00:01:58,520
remaining rows will only be the matching

84

00:01:58,520  -->  00:01:58,530

85

00:01:58,530  -->  00:02:01,190
rows, so in this case Jack is matched

86

00:02:01,190  -->  00:02:01,200

87

00:02:01,200  -->  00:02:03,109
with Jack and Susan is matched with

88

00:02:03,109  -->  00:02:03,119

89

00:02:03,119  -->  00:02:06,230
Susan because we're just looking at the

90

00:02:06,230  -->  00:02:06,240

91

00:02:06,240  -->  00:02:08,600
customer column on the left table and at

92

00:02:08,600  -->  00:02:08,610

93

00:02:08,610  -->  00:02:10,070
the employee column in the right table.

94

00:02:10,070  -->  00:02:10,080

95

00:02:10,080  -->  00:02:12,460
So once that matching is done,

96

00:02:12,460  -->  00:02:12,470

97

00:02:12,470  -->  00:02:14,260
the rest of the rows which haven't

98

00:02:14,260  -->  00:02:14,270

99

00:02:14,270  -->  00:02:16,840
matched are discarded and the remaining

100

00:02:16,840  -->  00:02:16,850

101

00:02:16,850  -->  00:02:18,790
table looks like this. So it only has

102

00:02:18,790  -->  00:02:18,800

103

00:02:18,800  -->  00:02:21,400
those rows that match and kind of glues

104

00:02:21,400  -->  00:02:21,410

105

00:02:21,410  -->  00:02:23,770
them together and that's it. That's what

106

00:02:23,770  -->  00:02:23,780

107

00:02:23,780  -->  00:02:26,380
the result of an inner join on these

108

00:02:26,380  -->  00:02:26,390

109

00:02:26,390  -->  00:02:28,090
two tables would look like.

110

00:02:28,090  -->  00:02:28,100

111

00:02:28,100  -->  00:02:30,340
Now let's have a look at a left join so

112

00:02:30,340  -->  00:02:30,350

113

00:02:30,350  -->  00:02:31,630
there's a few different types of joins

114

00:02:31,630  -->  00:02:31,640

115

00:02:31,640  -->  00:02:32,980
but now we're going to proceed to the

116

00:02:32,980  -->  00:02:32,990

117

00:02:32,990  -->  00:02:35,470
next week all the left outer join and

118

00:02:35,470  -->  00:02:35,480

119

00:02:35,480  -->  00:02:37,000
ensure it can also be called the left

120

00:02:37,000  -->  00:02:37,010

121

00:02:37,010  -->  00:02:39,310
join so a left join basically says that

122

00:02:39,310  -->  00:02:39,320

123

00:02:39,320  -->  00:02:41,980
the primary table is the one on the left,

124

00:02:41,980  -->  00:02:41,990

125

00:02:41,990  -->  00:02:45,070
once again we're joining on the first

126

00:02:45,070  -->  00:02:45,080

127

00:02:45,080  -->  00:02:46,630
column of the first table. Customer

128

00:02:46,630  -->  00:02:46,640

129

00:02:46,640  -->  00:02:48,760
equals to the first column of second

130

00:02:48,760  -->  00:02:48,770

131

00:02:48,770  -->  00:02:52,150
table which is employee and since the

132

00:02:52,150  -->  00:02:52,160

133

00:02:52,160  -->  00:02:55,690
left table is a primary one rows cannot

134

00:02:55,690  -->  00:02:55,700

135

00:02:55,700  -->  00:02:58,030
be discarded from the left table. Rows

136

00:02:58,030  -->  00:02:58,040

137

00:02:58,040  -->  00:02:59,949
will only be discarded from the

138

00:02:59,949  -->  00:02:59,959

139

00:02:59,959  -->  00:03:02,260
non-primary table, so here Jack is

140

00:03:02,260  -->  00:03:02,270

141

00:03:02,270  -->  00:03:04,300
matched with Jack, Susan's matched with Susan

142

00:03:04,300  -->  00:03:04,310

143

00:03:04,310  -->  00:03:06,460
again and then the rest of the rows in

144

00:03:06,460  -->  00:03:06,470

145

00:03:06,470  -->  00:03:08,260
the second table are discarded because

146

00:03:08,260  -->  00:03:08,270

147

00:03:08,270  -->  00:03:10,360
they didn't have a match. And so the

148

00:03:10,360  -->  00:03:10,370

149

00:03:10,370  -->  00:03:12,010
resulting table will look like this.

150

00:03:12,010  -->  00:03:12,020

151

00:03:12,020  -->  00:03:14,710
Where there was a match, the rows are

152

00:03:14,710  -->  00:03:14,720

153

00:03:14,720  -->  00:03:16,690
glued together and where there was no

154

00:03:16,690  -->  00:03:16,700

155

00:03:16,700  -->  00:03:20,140
match the associated columns are left

156

00:03:20,140  -->  00:03:20,150

157

00:03:20,150  -->  00:03:24,190
blank or some in SQL basically those

158

00:03:24,190  -->  00:03:24,200

159

00:03:24,200  -->  00:03:27,310
columns will be nolde, so let's just keep

160

00:03:27,310  -->  00:03:27,320

161

00:03:27,320  -->  00:03:29,949
them blank for now. That's how left join

162

00:03:29,949  -->  00:03:29,959

163

00:03:29,959  -->  00:03:33,310
works and basically the main idea here

164

00:03:33,310  -->  00:03:33,320

165

00:03:33,320  -->  00:03:35,380
is that the table on the left of the join

166

00:03:35,380  -->  00:03:35,390

167

00:03:35,390  -->  00:03:37,449
is considered to be the primary table

168

00:03:37,449  -->  00:03:37,459

169

00:03:37,459  -->  00:03:39,100
and therefore rows cannot be discarded

170

00:03:39,100  -->  00:03:39,110

171

00:03:39,110  -->  00:03:41,860
from the table. Now let's have a look at

172

00:03:41,860  -->  00:03:41,870

173

00:03:41,870  -->  00:03:43,930
the right join, the right joint works in

174

00:03:43,930  -->  00:03:43,940

175

00:03:43,940  -->  00:03:46,150
a very similar way but on this in this

176

00:03:46,150  -->  00:03:46,160

177

00:03:46,160  -->  00:03:48,009
case the table on the right is the

178

00:03:48,009  -->  00:03:48,019

179

00:03:48,019  -->  00:03:49,930
primary table. So once again Jack is

180

00:03:49,930  -->  00:03:49,940

181

00:03:49,940  -->  00:03:51,490
matched to Jack, Susan is matched to

182

00:03:51,490  -->  00:03:51,500

183

00:03:51,500  -->  00:03:54,970
Susan and the rest of the rows in the

184

00:03:54,970  -->  00:03:54,980

185

00:03:54,980  -->  00:03:57,190
left table are discarded because it is

186

00:03:57,190  -->  00:03:57,200

187

00:03:57,200  -->  00:03:58,990
the secondary table, it's not the primary.

188

00:03:58,990  -->  00:03:59,000

189

00:03:59,000  -->  00:04:01,600
Rows in the primary table on the other

190

00:04:01,600  -->  00:04:01,610

191

00:04:01,610  -->  00:04:03,850
hand cannot be discarded so the final

192

00:04:03,850  -->  00:04:03,860

193

00:04:03,860  -->  00:04:05,920
result here is a table which looks like

194

00:04:05,920  -->  00:04:05,930

195

00:04:05,930  -->  00:04:09,250
this. Once again the two sets of columns

196

00:04:09,250  -->  00:04:09,260

197

00:04:09,260  -->  00:04:10,570
have been glued together and where there

198

00:04:10,570  -->  00:04:10,580

199

00:04:10,580  -->  00:04:13,420
was no match on the left, the values in

200

00:04:13,420  -->  00:04:13,430

201

00:04:13,430  -->  00:04:16,120
the columns are left blank or nolde and

202

00:04:16,120  -->  00:04:16,130

203

00:04:16,130  -->  00:04:17,830
finally let's have a look at a full

204

00:04:17,830  -->  00:04:17,840

205

00:04:17,840  -->  00:04:18,789
outer join.

206

00:04:18,789  -->  00:04:18,799

207

00:04:18,799  -->  00:04:20,680
So in a full outer join we're looking at

208

00:04:20,680  -->  00:04:20,690

209

00:04:20,690  -->  00:04:23,290
the union of the two tables or,

210

00:04:23,290  -->  00:04:23,300

211

00:04:23,300  -->  00:04:25,150
probably unions not the right word. We're

212

00:04:25,150  -->  00:04:25,160

213

00:04:25,160  -->  00:04:26,070
looking at

214

00:04:26,070  -->  00:04:26,080

215

00:04:26,080  -->  00:04:28,200
all of the rows in the two tables and

216

00:04:28,200  -->  00:04:28,210

217

00:04:28,210  -->  00:04:30,240
that's why you see this

218

00:04:30,240  -->  00:04:30,250

219

00:04:30,250  -->  00:04:32,460
those two circles in the Venn diagram up

220

00:04:32,460  -->  00:04:32,470

221

00:04:32,470  -->  00:04:36,510
the top fully yellow and that means that

222

00:04:36,510  -->  00:04:36,520

223

00:04:36,520  -->  00:04:38,939
we cannot discard or the join will not

224

00:04:38,939  -->  00:04:38,949

225

00:04:38,949  -->  00:04:41,070
discard any of the rows in any of the

226

00:04:41,070  -->  00:04:41,080

227

00:04:41,080  -->  00:04:42,420
two tables.

228

00:04:42,420  -->  00:04:42,430

229

00:04:42,430  -->  00:04:44,189
Once again we're looking for matches so

230

00:04:44,189  -->  00:04:44,199

231

00:04:44,199  -->  00:04:46,110
Jack is matched with Jack, Susan is

232

00:04:46,110  -->  00:04:46,120

233

00:04:46,120  -->  00:04:48,089
matched with Susan and then what happens

234

00:04:48,089  -->  00:04:48,099

235

00:04:48,099  -->  00:04:50,580
is no rows are discarded and the tables are

236

00:04:50,580  -->  00:04:50,590

237

00:04:50,590  -->  00:04:52,439
glued together and that is what the

238

00:04:52,439  -->  00:04:52,449

239

00:04:52,449  -->  00:04:55,020
final result looks like. So on the right,

240

00:04:55,020  -->  00:04:55,030

241

00:04:55,030  -->  00:04:56,820
there's blank spaces where there was no

242

00:04:56,820  -->  00:04:56,830

243

00:04:56,830  -->  00:04:59,700
match to the table on the left, and on

244

00:04:59,700  -->  00:04:59,710

245

00:04:59,710  -->  00:05:01,230
the left there's black spaces where

246

00:05:01,230  -->  00:05:01,240

247

00:05:01,240  -->  00:05:02,790
there was no match to the table on the

248

00:05:02,790  -->  00:05:02,800

249

00:05:02,800  -->  00:05:05,309
right. So once again I'll just go back to

250

00:05:05,309  -->  00:05:05,319

251

00:05:05,319  -->  00:05:06,779
the previous slide and here you'll see

252

00:05:06,779  -->  00:05:06,789

253

00:05:06,789  -->  00:05:11,520
the two table separately and now off to

254

00:05:11,520  -->  00:05:11,530

255

00:05:11,530  -->  00:05:13,379
the join, this is what the final table

256

00:05:13,379  -->  00:05:13,389

257

00:05:13,389  -->  00:05:14,969
will look like.

258

00:05:14,969  -->  00:05:14,979

259

00:05:14,979  -->  00:05:18,779
So that's how full outer join works and

260

00:05:18,779  -->  00:05:18,789

261

00:05:18,789  -->  00:05:20,850
now let's just quickly recap on the

262

00:05:20,850  -->  00:05:20,860

263

00:05:20,860  -->  00:05:23,430
types of joins that we discussed. So we

264

00:05:23,430  -->  00:05:23,440

265

00:05:23,440  -->  00:05:25,649
had a look at four different joins, the

266

00:05:25,649  -->  00:05:25,659

267

00:05:25,659  -->  00:05:28,439
inner join which only looks at the

268

00:05:28,439  -->  00:05:28,449

269

00:05:28,449  -->  00:05:32,129
matching rows, the left join which keeps

270

00:05:32,129  -->  00:05:32,139

271

00:05:32,139  -->  00:05:34,260
the left tabe.. the table on the left as

272

00:05:34,260  -->  00:05:34,270

273

00:05:34,270  -->  00:05:36,390
the primary temple, the right joint which

274

00:05:36,390  -->  00:05:36,400

275

00:05:36,400  -->  00:05:37,769
keeps the table on the right as the

276

00:05:37,769  -->  00:05:37,779

277

00:05:37,779  -->  00:05:40,320
primary table and the full join or the

278

00:05:40,320  -->  00:05:40,330

279

00:05:40,330  -->  00:05:43,200
full outer join which does not discard

280

00:05:43,200  -->  00:05:43,210

281

00:05:43,210  -->  00:05:46,469
any rows from any of the tables. So in

282

00:05:46,469  -->  00:05:46,479

283

00:05:46,479  -->  00:05:48,360
your work you're probably going to be

284

00:05:48,360  -->  00:05:48,370

285

00:05:48,370  -->  00:05:50,879
using inner joins and left joins mostly

286

00:05:50,879  -->  00:05:50,889

287

00:05:50,889  -->  00:05:52,950
and that is because right joins are

288

00:05:52,950  -->  00:05:52,960

289

00:05:52,960  -->  00:05:56,459
rarely used simply because a right join

290

00:05:56,459  -->  00:05:56,469

291

00:05:56,469  -->  00:05:58,260
is the same as a left join just the

292

00:05:58,260  -->  00:05:58,270

293

00:05:58,270  -->  00:05:59,760
tables you just have to switch the

294

00:05:59,760  -->  00:05:59,770

295

00:05:59,770  -->  00:06:02,189
tables around so put the one on the

296

00:06:02,189  -->  00:06:02,199

297

00:06:02,199  -->  00:06:03,570
right on the left and the one that was

298

00:06:03,570  -->  00:06:03,580

299

00:06:03,580  -->  00:06:04,800
on the left on the right and you'll get

300

00:06:04,800  -->  00:06:04,810

301

00:06:04,810  -->  00:06:06,990
a left join once again. So most of the

302

00:06:06,990  -->  00:06:07,000

303

00:06:07,000  -->  00:06:08,640
time I personally use inner joins and

304

00:06:08,640  -->  00:06:08,650

305

00:06:08,650  -->  00:06:11,339
left joints sometimes you'll rarely find

306

00:06:11,339  -->  00:06:11,349

307

00:06:11,349  -->  00:06:13,439
that people do require full joins for

308

00:06:13,439  -->  00:06:13,449

309

00:06:13,449  -->  00:06:15,149
the task at hand.

310

00:06:15,149  -->  00:06:15,159

311

00:06:15,159  -->  00:06:16,890
So those were the type of joins and

312

00:06:16,890  -->  00:06:16,900

313

00:06:16,900  -->  00:06:18,480
that brings us to the conclusion of

314

00:06:18,480  -->  00:06:18,490

315

00:06:18,490  -->  00:06:20,640
today's tutorial and I look forward to seeing you next

316

00:06:20,640  -->  00:06:20,650

317

00:06:20,650  -->  00:06:25,860
time.
