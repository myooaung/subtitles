00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:08,790
Hello and welcome back to the course on Tableau.

2
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:14,650
In today's tutorial we will connect our special and PDA data and also take care of some data integrity

3
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,730
and data completeness.

4
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:22,760
Now in the previous tutorial we connected to each of the data sources individually but we need to join

5
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:27,970
them together to get the additional information relating to the crime statistics onto the map.

6
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:29,800
So we'll use a join for that.

7
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:33,280
Now we've already done most of the work on our crime stats on our PDA.

8
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:36,990
So let's delete everything else so we can delete this sheet over here.

9
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:43,180
And if we go into our data source we can also just go to New York parks and public spaces and just close

10
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:46,780
the data source just to keep our workbook nice and tidy.

11
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:53,860
Now we can also go back again and just rename our data source as well and we can call those New York

12
00:00:54,400 --> 00:01:03,040
crime stats with geometry a nice long name but at least we know which one it is and what we can do now

13
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:07,900
is just follow there or redo the steps from their previous lecture where maybe connected to the spatial

14
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:08,570
form.

15
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:11,220
Now this case we won't go to data on new data source.

16
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:14,680
We want to use the same data source and just add another connection.

17
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:20,230
So we adding another connection by taking spatial fall and selecting our shape file.

18
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:27,040
Now immediately tableau will see that we want to join these two together and seeing as it can find a

19
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:30,760
field which to join on it allows us to select what we want to do.

20
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:36,910
So we're going to do an INNER JOIN because we want all the fields from both datasets that join together

21
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,360
so and how we'll be joined these do.

22
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:46,170
So we know we've got the park name on the PBF side and now on the far side we know the name is gold

23
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:48,370
or the field name with the park name in there.

24
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:50,270
He scored 91 1.

25
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:55,170
So once we've selected that tableau populates it for us and we can just close our joint.

26
00:01:55,210 --> 00:02:00,190
Now that seems that that was just way too easy but we've done all the hard work before.

27
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:05,920
But let's just quickly check also the data integrity and data completeness and I cannot stress enough

28
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:11,020
that when working with open source data just to make sure especially when combining two data sources

29
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:16,480
on a net feel like a name that something hasn't gone wrong you haven't created additional records or

30
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:21,940
duplicate entries and some of the records that you wanted to show especially when using the enjoy is

31
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:25,450
actually you know from our PDA side is actually in there.

32
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:30,490
So first thing we'll check is just the number of records once again or the number of incidents and we

33
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:32,500
know previously we had 109.

34
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,990
Now we have 104.

35
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:36,260
So something has gone wrong.

36
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,130
So what will be checked.

37
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,060
There's two things we will look for.

38
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:45,130
Firstly we'll look at duplicates if any duplicates have been created even though the number of records

39
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:45,700
is less.

40
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:50,260
It's always good to check the duplicates because if there were records that were dropped the duplicates

41
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:51,690
can actually make up for that.

42
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:56,070
And we'll also look with them for records that did enjoin properly.

43
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:01,750
So first how we start off with us is we can take the name 3 1 1 which is from our spatial fault but

44
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:06,050
that into rows and take the park name into rows as well.

45
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:10,060
And now we can see with the number of incidents which we don't want by the way we actually want the

46
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:16,990
number of records because we want to see is for between the PD F and these sorry between the PD F on

47
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:19,530
this side and the spatial fall and that side.

48
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:20,950
Are there any duplicate records.

49
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:28,660
Do we have records for doing that and is more than one and we can just actually sort on that and immediately

50
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:31,400
we see and there are quite a range of those.

51
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:32,600
So how do we go about this.

52
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:38,350
Now we need to deliver on this project and we don't have time now to investigate this.

53
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:45,160
So what we will do is we will look at how we can exclude these discuss them with outline or look for

54
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:50,710
alternative data but for the purposes of this story that we will just now exclude this because we don't

55
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:58,600
have access to change the spatial data but what we can also look at is that some of these do not actually

56
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:03,940
have a number of incidents so you remember from our video file that there were records that had zero

57
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:04,840
incidents.

58
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:10,690
So what we could do is we can just take the incidents put that into filter and filter all of the zeroes

59
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:15,430
out just to see you know in terms of what actually there the problem is.

60
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:21,580
So if we do that we see there's only two records that had incidents that creates duplicate injuries

61
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:22,530
on there.

62
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:27,910
So what we will do for now is we can just take these two we'll just select both of them and we'll just

63
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:34,540
service or select them up again pest control see and put them into an Excel document just to make sure

64
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,420
that we keep track of what we are.

65
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:37,640
And let me just open that up.

66
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:44,000
What we are excluding or putting on the parking lot to take care of after we finish the visualization

67
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:47,420
and that will take care of our duplicate entries.

68
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,130
So now we are also concerned about anything that hasn't joined.

69
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:55,630
So let's go back to our data source change our joint type 2 and left joint.

70
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,970
Now that would take all of the entries if you remember correctly from the previous section or previous

71
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:08,810
tutorials we will take all of the entries here from our media fall and only the joining ones on the

72
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:15,650
spatial fall and this will allow us to have a look at any entries in here that had actually incidents

73
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:18,530
more than zero that did not join to a special file correct.

74
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:23,600
And that could be due to a number of different reasons and the spelling might be incorrect or a name

75
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,750
change could have taken place or any other inconsistencies.

76
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,310
But let's have a look at our sheet one.

77
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:30,230
So again we want.

78
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:33,100
OK so we know we need to be filtering for incident zero.

79
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:38,300
We are counting the number of records in there and let's just actually again sort this.

80
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,810
Now that we've made the change is sorted once again.

81
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:42,230
Now what do we see.

82
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:49,160
There are indeed parks and you remember these box are from your PD a file and these parks do not have

83
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:56,090
a corresponding entry in your spatial file which means that these do actually have incidents connected

84
00:05:56,090 --> 00:06:03,110
to them but they are not being able to show on the graph on the map which means then that our data will

85
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:03,770
not be complete.

86
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:07,490
So just as while we check this and again we can just highlight these.

87
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:10,280
We can just highlight all of these.

88
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:17,180
Just copy them and put them in an Excel document because as we know we will we will just for now at

89
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:23,480
least ignore these and keep them on the list to discuss with outlined separately or look for alternative

90
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,590
solution.

91
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:27,550
And that's basically the ones they live in that we will be using.

92
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,850
So we'll just copy that.

93
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,850
And now if we go back into tableau we can join go back to our data source change our drawing to an inner

94
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:36,080
join once again.

95
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,570
And now we just need to exclude those.

96
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:44,390
Now we know we will do this at the data source filter and we actually already excluded the data source

97
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:48,300
filter while on the net source full of the total.

98
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:53,570
If you remember correctly from earlier and now we can just use this custom value list option over here

99
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:58,370
to paste what we have just copied into the list and it would exclude these ones.

100
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:00,200
In addition as well.

101
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,000
And then we're just gonna.

102
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:01,760
Okay.

103
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:04,930
And our number of entries are joined up.

104
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:10,670
And if we now look at any problems you can see all the numbers have disappeared and we only have one

105
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:11,750
record for each of them.

106
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:13,640
So this is exactly what we have done.

107
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:18,230
Not the best solution because we do want to show all of them but we'll put it on the parking lot for

108
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:19,370
now to investigate.

109
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:25,340
Once we've completed the visualization now we can just clean up our data source so we know there's any

110
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:30,860
certain fields you want to keep so we can hide the first three and we can rename this name 3 1 1 to

111
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:36,860
give it a more descriptive name and we will just cool this park name then we will continue in hiding

112
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,530
more of these fields.

113
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,040
We really don't need it right now.

114
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,560
And we'll go up to burrow.

115
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:48,700
We want to keep burrow so immune to give a proper name and let's just call this the city burrow.

116
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:54,860
All right then continue hiding and I think the only field we still need is the geometry so we can just

117
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:59,960
select all of them by holding down shift and click hide.

118
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:05,090
I guess this is already second nature to you so if I am skipping a few steps luckily you already looked

119
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:07,170
at the previous tutorials.

120
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:07,630
All right.

121
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:07,810
So.

122
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:09,740
And that's in essence what we were looking for.

123
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:15,650
We've got the park name from obviously from both that are sources the city borough the geometry which

124
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:20,890
we spoke about and the borough from our PDA fault as well as the incidents.

125
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,030
In actual fact we can hide also.

126
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:25,750
The borough from our PDA fault.

127
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:29,730
We will use it from the actual from the city generated information.

128
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:30,240
Okay.

129
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:34,240
So that is then our data ready and prepped for our visualization.

130
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:39,300
So let's quickly clear that what we've created and just put the geometry on there to see what we'll

131
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:39,760
deal with.

132
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,420
And that is exactly it.

133
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:43,050
You can see we don't have central Park.

134
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:48,320
Central Park wasn't in our crime statistics so obviously doing in adjoining to remove them and it will

135
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:53,330
remove all of the problematic ones which we've identified but at least we know our data is complete

136
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:55,910
for what our purposes are today.

137
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:00,890
Now in the next material we will finally get to creating that awesome visualization and putting everything

138
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:01,820
together.

139
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,830
And I look forward to seeing you next time.

140
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:05,600
Until then happy analyzing.
