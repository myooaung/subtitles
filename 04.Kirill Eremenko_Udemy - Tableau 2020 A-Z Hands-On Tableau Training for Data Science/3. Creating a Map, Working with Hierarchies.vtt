00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.040
Hello and welcome back to the course on Tablo.

2
00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:11.670
And in today's tutorial, we will be carrying a map and we will learn how to work with hierarchies.

3
00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.510
Now, if you recall, the first time we created a map was in the very first section of the course.

4
00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:18.840
That time would create a map of the US.

5
00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:25.020
And we kind of analyzed how a certain store was performing across the different states of the U.S..

6
00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:30.370
Today, we'll be working with a map of Europe and we will spend much more time on it so that we can

7
00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:33.640
understand exactly how to work geographical data and tableau.

8
00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:35.410
So let's get straight to it.

9
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.670
First thing we're going to do is we're going to save a workbook because we didn't do that last time.

10
00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.010
So we'll click save as Section four.

11
00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:43.140
There we go.

12
00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.250
And now we're going to start by creating our first hierarchy.

13
00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:50.110
And why do we need a hierarchy?

14
00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:56.380
Well, that is because we have certain elements of geographical information in our data that we need

15
00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:59.550
to tell Tablo how they work together.

16
00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:00.910
And let's have a look at that.

17
00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:06.490
So here on the left in the dimensions, you can see right away that some fields have been picked up

18
00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:07.720
as geographical data.

19
00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.100
And the globe represents that.

20
00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.960
Some fields have been picked up as text and some fields have been picked up as date.

21
00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.150
And so here we have three elements of geographical data that Tableau recognizes.

22
00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.730
It's the city, the country and the state.

23
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.330
No region is also an element of geographical data.

24
00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:31.270
It's north, south, central or west or east Europe.

25
00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:38.200
But in this case, Tablo doesn't have that geographical or that level of geographical information or

26
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.710
that layer.

27
00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.650
So in this case, Tablo doesn't recognize it.

28
00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:46.090
And that's OK for us because it's sufficient for us to work with these three.

29
00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:52.930
Now, at the same time, these are all elements of geographical information.

30
00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.940
But we also know that a city can only be in one country, a country can only be in one state.

31
00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.640
So therefore, there is a hierarchy and natural hierarchy there.

32
00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.950
And we have to show Tablo how it works.

33
00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.000
And Tablo is already prompting us to create a hierarchy here.

34
00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:08.950
And we can go ahead with that.

35
00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:14.640
But for now, we'll just delete this hierarchy that Tablo has prompted for us and we'll create our own.

36
00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.910
So we'll just click remove hierarchy and now we will start by carrying out.

37
00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:25.780
The easiest way to do it is to take any of the elements, let's say, city, and drag it on to its parent

38
00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:26.190
element.

39
00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.300
So in this case, country.

40
00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.350
And so now we will is tablas prompting us to create a hierarchy called country city.

41
00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:37.320
But we'll just call it geography because we know that we will add more into this hierarchy just now.

42
00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.550
So if we do that right away, you can see that country and city have been moved into this hierarchy

43
00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.360
separately away from the rest of the dimensions.

44
00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:52.110
So now if we take state and we also move it in here, we can put them in between, put in between.

45
00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.840
We can put it anywhere.

46
00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.120
But we know that state goes between country and city.

47
00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.530
So that's where we will put it.

48
00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:02.170
And now we have create a national hierarchy, um, for us to work with going forward.

49
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:08.860
And so now what we can do is we can take country and we can drag it into our workspace.

50
00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.670
And once we've done that right away, you can see a map of Europe has appeared.

51
00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.780
So I'll just make this smaller so that we can zoom in a little bit.

52
00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:25.540
So a map of Europe has appeared and the dots represent the countries that are in our data set.

53
00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.500
So there's a United Kingdom, Germany, Norway and so on.

54
00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:36.430
Now you can also see this little plus sign and the plus sign appears because there is a hierarchy that

55
00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:41.980
Tableau knows about, the one that we just created, and it knows that it can drill into the data further

56
00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.700
and that's why it's allowing us to do that.

57
00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:48.700
So if we click the plus sign right away, you can see that instead of a dot for every country now we

58
00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:49.900
have a dot for every state.

59
00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.000
So let's zoom in to France, for instance.

60
00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:56.440
And you can see here that in every single state of France, there is a dot.

61
00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:04.030
And that's because we are looking at the level of granularity of state, and that's because we have

62
00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:12.820
state, as you recall, whatever dimensions are listed on our worksheet, that's the level of granularity

63
00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:14.020
that table is going to be looking at.

64
00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:19.680
So once again, we can click this plus sign on the state and that will drill in further into city.

65
00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.540
So now we have a dot represents the city.

66
00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:28.870
So we have a dot for every single city that our, uh, that is present in our dataset.

67
00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.590
So, um, there's going to be a lawyer.

68
00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:40.090
There is literally my pronunciation might not be the best, but as you can see, there's a lot more

69
00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:41.200
dots here right now.

70
00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:46.570
And in fact, you can keep track of the number of marks on your chart or map.

71
00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:51.690
As we discussed in the bottom left corner here right now, there's 1001 marks.

72
00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:54.100
So that's quite a lot of data points.

73
00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:00.280
And we can really start working with this, in fact, we're going to go back one step and we will leave

74
00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.610
them up at the level of granularity of a state.

75
00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.000
So we'll just collapse that.

76
00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.970
And now let's go ahead and start working with this.

77
00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:11.800
So what are we going to do first?

78
00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:19.270
Things first is is always important to know how many if you have more than one year in your data and,

79
00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:25.960
you know, because you got to be careful not to aggregate information from different years if you don't

80
00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:26.380
need that.

81
00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:30.190
So first thing we're going to do is we're going to take all the data and drag it into filters.

82
00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:32.170
And we really know how to work with filters.

83
00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:32.380
Right.

84
00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:40.570
So, um, we're going to add it into filters here and we will just choose not range of dates, but will

85
00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:41.410
choose years.

86
00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:47.380
So next and let's say we want to look at 2012 to start with, OK.

87
00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:53.200
And just as we did before, what we're going to do is we're going to create a quick filter show, quick

88
00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:53.700
filter.

89
00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:55.650
There it is, our quick filter.

90
00:05:55.660 --> 00:06:01.450
So I'll just make the workbook a little bit smaller so we can fit our quick filter in.

91
00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.320
And in this case, we obviously don't need all.

92
00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:07.960
So what are we going to do is customize, show all value.

93
00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:12.220
We don't need it and we will change this to a single value slider.

94
00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:15.340
So now you can slide along and you can see how the data changes.

95
00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:17.170
So that was the first thing that we wanted to do.

96
00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:23.470
And now working with a single year, what we're going to do is we're going to create some colors and

97
00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:24.940
some sizes on our chart.

98
00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:30.940
So first thing that we're going to do is we're going to say that we want to look at how many sales were

99
00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:34.450
done in every single of these, every single one of these regions.

100
00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:37.030
So we're going to take sales and we'll drag it on to size.

101
00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:44.620
And right away we can see that the bubbles have changed size because now they represent sales and they

102
00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:45.310
look a bit small.

103
00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:46.890
So that's an increase the size a little bit.

104
00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:53.230
Let's take it to this level, for instance, and then we'll go to colors and give it a border, let's

105
00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:56.920
say a black border, to make it kind of stand out a little bit.

106
00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:57.760
That's good.

107
00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:03.210
Now, what we're going to do is we're going to create a calculated field.

108
00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:11.800
What we want to do and what was told in the challenge, what we were told in the challenge is to look

109
00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:14.770
at the profit margin for every single state.

110
00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:17.040
So let's go ahead and do that.

111
00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:25.660
We need to create a field that will take the sum of profit and divide it by the sum of sales, and that

112
00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:26.850
will give us a profit margin.

113
00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:28.150
So we're going to right.

114
00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:29.230
Click on profit here.

115
00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:33.790
We will go to, um, create calculated field.

116
00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.970
And here we'll call it profit margin.

117
00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:39.550
We need some of profit.

118
00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:45.940
So it's important to take the sum of all the profits for all the orders in that specific region first

119
00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:50.140
and then divide it by the sum of total sales for that region.

120
00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:57.080
Rather than divide taking profit, divided by sales and then taking the sum so it's important here to

121
00:07:57.350 --> 00:08:02.240
first sum up all the profits, sum up all the sales and then divide one by the other, click apply.

122
00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:06.020
OK, so we have profit margin now and now.

123
00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:12.950
If we take profit margin and drag it on to color, what you will see is that the field here is called

124
00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:17.400
Eigg profit margin, which means aggregate of profit margin.

125
00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:24.350
Basically, it's telling us that this is already an aggregated field because profit margin is a calculated

126
00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:29.210
field which takes which first takes a sum of profit and divides by the sum of sales.

127
00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:35.510
So Tablo is telling us that this is not just a single value field, it's an action aggregated field.

128
00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:38.440
And just kind of warning us about that next.

129
00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:43.490
What we're going to do is we're going to adjust the colors and we're going to take, um, let's say

130
00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:45.680
instead of red green, let's go red.

131
00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:48.680
Blue will apply that.

132
00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:55.110
And now we will say that we want a specific levels of profit margin.

133
00:08:55.140 --> 00:09:01.850
So anything, um, below zero point five minus zero point five is already very bad.

134
00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:05.270
Anything over zero point five is great.

135
00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:08.240
So if we click apply, we'll get a chart like that.

136
00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:10.730
And yeah.

137
00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:12.200
So that's, that's pretty much it.

138
00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:14.000
That's what we wanted from our map.

139
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:22.100
And now if we scroll around, we can see how the profit margins and the sales changed over the years.

140
00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:28.880
And once again, if you put your mouse over any specific region or any specific state, it will tell

141
00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:35.360
you the country, the state, the sales and the profit margin for that specific period of time that

142
00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:35.930
you're looking at.

143
00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:43.610
So let's go up here, because we can zoom out a bit because we've got, um, Sweden here, Stockholm,

144
00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:46.580
uh, Finland and so on.

145
00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:47.000
So.

146
00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:49.820
We can see how they're changing as well.

147
00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:54.180
What else you can do is you can highlight highlight things here.

148
00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:59.320
So let's say you can do a square highlighting like that if you like.

149
00:10:00.610 --> 00:10:06.480
But we'll talk more about this a bit in a bit when we're working with our first dashboard.

150
00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:08.470
So that's just the different types of highlighting.

151
00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:10.720
You have an tableau, so have a play around with that.

152
00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:12.330
See what else you can do.

153
00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:19.510
Maybe you want to not look at profit margin, but, um, some other parameter or some other metric of

154
00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:23.530
how the regions are or how the states are performing.

155
00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:26.420
Maybe you want to drill down to city levels.

156
00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:32.230
So here right away, you can see we have many, many more circles and this is showing the same thing.

157
00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:36.220
So basically the profit margin for every city, maybe you don't want to see that.

158
00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:41.380
Maybe you can go back to country and look at individual countries rather than states.

159
00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:44.320
So lots of things you can do if this map here.

160
00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:47.200
And so I'll leave it at that for now.

161
00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:50.680
In the next tutorial, we will create a scatterplot.

162
00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:55.510
And then in the tutorial after that, we will finally create our first dashboard where we will start

163
00:10:55.510 --> 00:10:56.550
combining worksheets.

164
00:10:57.190 --> 00:11:00.800
So I hope you enjoyed this tutorial and I look forward to seeing you next time.

165
00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:02.680
And until then, happy idolising.
