Hi guys I hope you enjoyed that section and in this tutorial I just wanted to show you that you can

2
00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.340
download all of the videos that we create in this course in order to get access to these visuals.

3
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.920
All you have to do is bring up a browser and go to my Tableau Public Profile.

4
00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:27.480
So go to w w w dot public dot tableau dot com slash profiles slash Carol dot Arum ankle.

5
00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:33.060
And here you can see that you can download all of the visuals that we create in this course and not

6
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:39.240
just the pictures but the actual workbook so we have to do is select this download icon over here and

7
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.460
you'll download the workbook to your computer and you can open up in tableau.

8
00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.320
So hopefully they'll be useful you can use these visuals to either check your work after you've completed

9
00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.160
a section or you can just download them before a section and follow along if you like.

10
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:59.610
It's up to you how you'd like to structure this learning process but these resources are there to help

11
00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:01.540
you if you need them.

12
00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.180
And I hope they'll be helpful.

13
00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.620
I look forward to seeing you next time.

14
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.510
And until then happy analyzing.
