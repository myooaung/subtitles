00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,180
Hello and welcome back to the course on tableau.

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,840
And today we're talking about a new and exciting feature in Table 9 which is called the Data interpreter.

3
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:19,940
And as we discussed previously we already know that machine and human format for Diaries is a bit different.

4
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:27,870
So let's go ahead and have a look at how tablet can help us overcome these challenges that occur when

5
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:32,130
we're trying to import human like data into software like Tableau.

6
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:38,720
So first of all we're going to need our browser and in our browser we're going to go to super data sites

7
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:40,340
dot com slash tableau.

8
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:46,730
Scroll down to the bottom here at the bottom you can see a file which is called personal vehicle sales

9
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:47,910
global.

10
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:50,180
Let's go ahead and download that.

11
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:51,160
All right.

12
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,390
Saving that file.

13
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:53,980
That's good.

14
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:57,160
And now I'm going to open the folder.

15
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,240
There it is.

16
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,800
So is our file.

17
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,320
Personal vehicle sales lowball.

18
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,590
Just drag that into Excel.

19
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:05,320
And there we go.

20
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,150
So this is what our file looks like.

21
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:18,590
It's a report showing how the sales of vehicles personal vehicles have been growing or changing through

22
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:20,420
the past couple of years.

23
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:22,190
And so how many years do we have here.

24
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:23,180
Ten years.

25
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:28,490
And you can see here these numbers represent the total number of vehicles sold.

26
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:29,540
So these are not dollars.

27
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:30,530
These are actual numbers.

28
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:36,230
So for instance in Austria in 2014 there was about three hundred three thousand personal vehicles that

29
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:37,110
were sold.

30
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:46,400
And as you can see the format of this spreadsheet is very much oriented as humans and saying humans.

31
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,450
I'm not a robot.

32
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:50,030
It's very much oriented at us humans.

33
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:54,620
So here at the gray grade ones you can see these are approximate numbers.

34
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:58,970
So estimated figures here there's like a legend a little bit of a legend up there.

35
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:02,500
And right away you can see like there's a header as we discussed.

36
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:08,480
There's this top row scrolls along top five rows crawl along.

37
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:12,260
That's because it's easy for us to navigate that way.

38
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:12,650
What else.

39
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:18,340
So here we've got some totals for instance Europe or let's have a look at this one.

40
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:19,670
Laughter.

41
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,290
So the North American Free Trade Agreement.

42
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,820
That's Canada Mexico United States.

43
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:29,090
So you can see these totals which will obviously jump into our data and we don't want that then just

44
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:34,900
America the totals for the whole of America including NAFTA and the Central and South America.

45
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,820
And then there's like empty rows all over the place.

46
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:40,760
What else do we have here that's that can be a problem here.

47
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:45,790
We've got all the countries total often immaterial and some comments over here of stars.

48
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:51,140
You will also notice it took me I took me a while actually to figure that to see this one is that there

49
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:55,910
is hidden columns in here and you often forget about those superior and hide.

50
00:02:55,910 --> 00:03:02,540
You'll see that there's actually three hidden columns here and that can also interfere with our data

51
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:04,280
input when we do start doing it.

52
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:09,860
So this is quite a challenging file as you can see for a machine to comprehend.

53
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:12,620
Let's go ahead and see how Tableau is going to handle it.

54
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:15,060
So I'm just going to close the file for now.

55
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:15,620
I don't actually.

56
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:17,600
I'll keep it open because we might need to have a look at it.

57
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,350
So I'm going to open up tableau tableau.

58
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:27,710
And here we've got a lot of beautiful spreadsheets or tabs and worksheets that we've been working on.

59
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:31,020
So we're going to go to connect in your file excel.

60
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,270
Here we've got the file personal vehicle sales global.

61
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,370
Open it up.

62
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:38,870
And right away we've got this preview at the bottom.

63
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,730
So let's zoom in a little bit.

64
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:45,300
We can see here that everything is completely mixed up.

65
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:52,340
So instead of the column names are like random or if one of two or three and then this one has a name

66
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:57,800
then it's some random names and some empty columns estimate figures that remember that piece of coal

67
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:05,810
color legend that we had one item that we've got the region's countries which are actually years or

68
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:12,170
so regions countries in this column in years in here as part of the data element so completely messed

69
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:13,610
up dates shouldn't be like that.

70
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:18,310
So what we're going to look at now is it is a tableau dot interpret it.

71
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:24,650
What it does is it allows Tableau to help you kind of understand what's going on and that all kind of

72
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:29,030
like it allows Tableau to be smart about what it can see in the data.

73
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:35,110
So here you can see a common saying that tableau dot interpreter might be able to help.

74
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:38,870
So why don't we go ahead and click turn on for that feature.

75
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:42,770
And so what happens now is the data is changed.

76
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:47,820
Now we've got regions countries as the name of this column which kind of sounds about right.

77
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:51,290
Names of these columns include both the year which is right.

78
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:57,440
So if we go back to our dataset here you'll see that the names of the columns are actually years but

79
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:00,560
also include a number which is not correct.

80
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:05,390
And then we've got some numbers it still has the totals which are which is not good but already a bit

81
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:05,660
better.

82
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:08,090
So let's try to understand what happened here.

83
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:09,970
What we're going to click on is this button here.

84
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:13,090
Review results once we click it.

85
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:15,340
A new spreadsheet is going to be open for us.

86
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,960
So this spreadsheet pops up.

87
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:22,470
Basically what it's showing us is it's got some descriptions here but the main tab that you want to

88
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:27,110
look at is the second tab and it's it's a description of what tableau saw.

89
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:29,000
So we're going to zoom in a little bit.

90
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,670
I'm gonna make this a bit wider so well that's a bit too wide.

91
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:34,260
Yes.

92
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:39,520
So what Tableau is telling us here is it's telling us what exactly it saw in the data.

93
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:44,620
So Tableau is saying all right these red ones so I can tableau completely ignore these white collar

94
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:50,960
white cells then these red cells as you can see here tableau saying that's a header I will look at that

95
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,830
as if it's a header.

96
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:57,770
And that's why in our data in our previous of our data we can see a combined date and the number because

97
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:58,810
tableau said OK.

98
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:04,200
So that's a header that's ahead I'll just combine the two combined combined combined combined.

99
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:11,210
And so that's how it created the header and then it's got these green cells which it considered to be

100
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:16,700
data which is quite correct to some extent some of these do have to be admitted because their totals.

101
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:21,930
And then as you can see it ignored the combatant end of this with this asterisks.

102
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:23,000
So that's a good start.

103
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,280
So we now know tableau can do a bit of work for us.

104
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:28,490
Let's help tableau out a little bit as well.

105
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:32,550
So I'm going to close that because we don't need that now.

106
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:35,400
We're going to close this as well we'll redo that in a second.

107
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:41,690
So what we're going to do now is we're going to adjust this file so it's so tableau can actually work

108
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:45,760
off it so it can do all the work for us but it can do definitely can do quite a lot of it.

109
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:51,800
So what we're going to do now to start off with is we obviously need to delete these totals because

110
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:57,410
they're the they're just remaining in our data and they're not being removed which is not good.

111
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:02,600
But before we delete them as soon as we delete the totals as you can imagine we will lose information

112
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:03,250
on.

113
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:07,670
So if I delete these rows like this we lost information on which region this was.

114
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:08,930
So this is Europe.

115
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:12,410
This is Europe new members we want to keep their information so we're going to add a column on the left

116
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:12,980
here.

117
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,390
So I basically pressed.

118
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:18,920
Control shift plus or you can just right click and insert.

119
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:23,090
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to copy the region name here.

120
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,040
Go to copy it.

121
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:34,060
So this is just an example of how to quickly fix up your data before importing into into tableau Africa.

122
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:34,930
And then we don't need that.

123
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:38,980
So next week we're going to do is we need to obviously copy down remember we talked about this.

124
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:44,000
So we need to copy down the name of the region for these empty cells as well so you can just double

125
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,620
click and or copy until the next one or you can drag an old copy.

126
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:50,240
This is basic basic Excel stuff.

127
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:56,960
I like to do what I like to do as I like to select all myself that I need to copy including the top

128
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,440
one.

129
00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:03,770
And then if you press control G on your keyboard and you go through then you click special and you go

130
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:04,410
to blank.

131
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,300
Okay.

132
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:10,320
And now you click enter this and then instead of pressing Enter you press console enter.

133
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:12,220
Then I'll do the whole job for you.

134
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:17,090
So as you can see Europe Europe Europe new members Russia after and so on.

135
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:24,050
So now all we have to do is control copy this and then I'll basically copy or paste values.

136
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:27,140
And now we don't have the formula we have values perfect.

137
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,530
And what that means is now we've got these copied.

138
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:33,540
Now we can get rid of these totals so we're going to control minus these.

139
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:37,640
So I'm basically deleting these rows with the totals.

140
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:45,370
So be careful here because there's some empty ones here South America there's another two.

141
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:47,080
There we go.

142
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,540
Destroy everything.

143
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:49,030
All right.

144
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,530
So that's all deleted.

145
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:56,020
Now we only have our countries and the region that they're from and of course the data over here.

146
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:57,910
And that's pretty much it.

147
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:02,450
You just have to obviously give this one a name so let's call it regions.

148
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:04,950
And he'll just leave countries.

149
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:05,320
All right.

150
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:08,110
So that's our file we fixed it up.

151
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:11,590
Doesn't even matter that we've got this empty row here.

152
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:12,930
Tabu will take care of the rest.

153
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:15,910
So let's go ahead and say that that saved.

154
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:19,010
Now open up tableau as well.

155
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:22,060
And we're going to go to excel.

156
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:24,580
Personal vehicle sales global.

157
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:25,810
There we go.

158
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:27,890
And once again problems.

159
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:34,330
So Tableau is it can see these empty empty columns it doesn't have all the names turn on dot interpreter

160
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:36,310
and voila.

161
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:37,390
Much better right away.

162
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:42,190
So this empty column is still here because I think there's like a value in one of the one of the rows.

163
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:46,510
So we're just gonna click it and click hide and perfect.

164
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:53,500
So now we can see the region the country the sales of the number of vehicles sold in that specific year

165
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:57,480
one second.

166
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:58,060
OK.

167
00:09:58,090 --> 00:09:58,690
So that's good.

168
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:01,510
Now what we want to do is we want to review results.

169
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:04,990
Just have a look at what tableau did exactly.

170
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:06,990
There it is.

171
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,660
So if you go to to the second tab you'll see that this is the header for tableau which is correct.

172
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:15,880
Then from here onwards it's the daughter Rose.

173
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:20,940
So the first thing I was a bit concerned with is did it pick up this empty row as a row of data.

174
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:24,380
But in reality if we count the rows here there's 144.

175
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:29,340
And now if we go back to Tableau it will tell us that there is one hundred and forty four rows here

176
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:34,470
so it basically picked it up as a data row but because it was empty it completely ignored it.

177
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:39,820
And so that's how the data interpret and Tableau works it can definitely save you some time and because

178
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:43,610
it cuts out these headers for you it ignores black crows and so on.

179
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:49,000
It doesn't do all the work but at the same time it can help you can nudge you in the right direction

180
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:56,170
if you import data you check what the data interpreted looked at and saw and then and then you corrected

181
00:10:56,170 --> 00:11:02,130
a little bit and then you send it send it back into tableau again then tableau can really help you out

182
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:10,000
and do the remaining groundwork for you so you can import the data into tableau in the next material.

183
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:16,280
We will look at another cool element of importing data and that will be pivoting data.

184
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,410
So that'll be fun.

185
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,160
And I look forward to seeing you next time.

186
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,770
Until then happy analyzing.
