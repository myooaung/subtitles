00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:05.220
Hello this is Carol.

2
00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.930
And welcome back to the course I'm tableau in the previous tutorial.

3
00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:13.740
We had a play around of colors and we had a look at three different approaches that we could take to

4
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.200
coloring a bar chart.

5
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:21.630
And we also discussed that coloring has a lot to do with personal preference because I might find something

6
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:26.280
appealing but you might not find the same approach appealing and vice versa.

7
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:30.650
And therefore there is that element of creativity and I do hope that you had a chance to play around

8
00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:36.120
of colors a bit more to kind of understand what you're leaning towards what color palettes you prefer

9
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.450
what styles and approaches to coloring you draw more.

10
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:47.100
But in any case don't worry because as we progress through this course you will naturally start developing

11
00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:58.710
a unique approach to coloring to formatting and adding labels and creating your own unique visualizations

12
00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.560
and developing this unique style of visualization.

13
00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.950
And today let's move ahead and talk about labels and formatting.

14
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.710
So we've got this chart in front of us.

15
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:16.740
And as we discussed there is a very high likelihood that this chart might be featured in the report

16
00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.080
or be posted somewhere on the wall.

17
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.600
So we want to make it look very chic and just very very appealing to the eye.

18
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.450
But that is not the only thing we're pursuing today.

19
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:35.580
There is one more thing that we are after and it might be it is definitely as important as making the

20
00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.120
chart look awesome and that is ease of understanding.

21
00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.850
Let me demonstrate with an example what I mean.

22
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.840
So here on this chart we definitely have all the information that we need.

23
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.600
We've got the names of the people we've got the regions that they're working in.

24
00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:56.280
We even have the total values of sales that they've performed.

25
00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:04.920
And so the bars have this access and you can by looking at the bar sell how much approximately each

26
00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.810
person has made in sales.

27
00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:14.210
So let's see what happens if for instance I ask somebody to tell me how much sales has built.

28
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.570
The person has to find Bill.

29
00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.740
So I look around and we find Bill here.

30
00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:24.270
Then the person has to move their eyes up to the top of the chart and then the person has to.

31
00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.270
Don't worry about this pop up on the right here.

32
00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.010
It's it's just in tableau.

33
00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.570
So when you do produce this report you won't have this pop up window.

34
00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:39.630
So once again the person has to find where Bill is moved their eyes to the top of the bar and then move

35
00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:44.280
their eyes to the left to understand where the total sales sit.

36
00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:52.510
And here they sit about at about maybe 1000 between 1500 and 2000 so maybe this in or around 1000 750

37
00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.270
or one thousand eight hundred.

38
00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.630
That's another one that's let's see how many sales James made.

39
00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:04.530
So once again we find James we move our eyes to the top then we move our eyes to the left here and we

40
00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:11.720
can see that James is somewhere between 1000 and 1500 but because he's further away from the Axis there's

41
00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:21.930
a bit more room for error so maybe he's with with this eye movement maybe sitting at 1600 or 1700.

42
00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.280
You can't really tell.

43
00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:30.930
And so that means that the person who's reading this chart has to put in some efforts to get the information

44
00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.640
out of it and that's not the way it should be.

45
00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:40.110
Tableau is a tool that allows you to very easily create visualizations but also it has the capacity

46
00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:47.220
to make those business patients to be very very easy to understand and that is an art form on its own.

47
00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:55.800
That is a part of what data scientists do we look for ways to communicate information in very simple

48
00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:01.290
forms so that people don't have to put an effort to understand it and extract information visually from

49
00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:03.030
what we are presenting them.

50
00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:04.910
So let's try fix that.

51
00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:06.140
What can we do.

52
00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.010
Let's try adding a label.

53
00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.060
So here you can see this button over here label and what that does.

54
00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.500
It adds textual information to the chart.

55
00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.720
And what we're going to add is we're actually going to take the sum of total sales we're going to press

56
00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.610
hold it press control and drag it onto label.

57
00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:29.200
And as you can see here now the actual sum of total sales has appeared on the bar chart.

58
00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.080
Oh actually James was between 1000 1500.

59
00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.690
So that's definitely not 1600.

60
00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:38.460
There you go.

61
00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:46.080
Now we can actually see the exact number of sell that each of these people has made and that already

62
00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:51.880
makes analysis or reading this chart much much easier.

63
00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:56.820
Now while we're on the topic of labels we can add more information to labels so let's say we want to

64
00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:59.670
add representative to drag him into label.

65
00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:01.440
Now we have the name there as well.

66
00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:07.110
We can also drag region but that's a bit excessive because we already have the representative name here

67
00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:08.770
and we've got the region name here.

68
00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:14.910
And moreover the region is the same for all these blue bars the same for Orange and so that's that is

69
00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:15.710
definitely excessive.

70
00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.270
And we're just going to remove those now.

71
00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.860
So we'll take region out and representative.

72
00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:25.780
And now we're left with the total value of sales.

73
00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:31.600
Now you can edit the label further if you go into label and then you click this.

74
00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.010
Dot dot dot button here.

75
00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:34.740
You can add your own text if you like.

76
00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:38.030
So you can say sales column.

77
00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:39.010
OK.

78
00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:43.480
And so here you can see that your text has appeared in label.

79
00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:49.450
Also you can see that this labels not displaying any text because it is too big it would overlap this

80
00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:55.920
label and you can fix that by right clicking and saying Mark label always show.

81
00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:59.400
And that way it's always going to be displayed.

82
00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:02.820
So now we're going to go back to label go to the dot dot dot.

83
00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:09.530
We're going to take out the sales text and we're going to click OK so what we want to do now is we want

84
00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:17.570
to fix up the formatting of our chart and that is probably the last step to getting our chart to the

85
00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:19.970
ready for production level.

86
00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:23.900
So let's start with the labels.

87
00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:32.610
If you want to change the size of the labels you just go into label over here and you select size and

88
00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:35.000
you select desire size that suits you.

89
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.010
So it's go of 12 and maybe you want to make them bold that looks pretty good.

90
00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:43.090
Also if you go into dot dot dot you can do the same here.

91
00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:48.630
So twelve and label size also you can change the color.

92
00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:53.290
You can do a lot of things we will keep it a black vinyl so that's good.

93
00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:55.030
That part's done.

94
00:06:55.310 --> 00:07:02.890
Another thing that we want to do is we want to change the type of label and I'll explain what I mean.

95
00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:07.620
Now in a second so we'll just right click on the labels here.

96
00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:10.390
And so this is where you normally go to format things.

97
00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:15.680
Labels have their own formatting over here but all other things in tableau have formatting through this

98
00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:23.840
right click format button which is pretty much the same as going here and selecting font or other things

99
00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:25.410
like alignment and so on.

100
00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:33.050
So here in when you're right click and you go to format once again here you can change the articles

101
00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:33.560
that again.

102
00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:36.660
So right click format.

103
00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:40.070
So this is the access you you've got to be careful here.

104
00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:44.560
You've got to go to the pain because the label is in the paint not on the axis.

105
00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:47.580
And here you can change the type of labels.

106
00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:55.310
So just to prove that this is label if I change this direction you will see that the label is changing

107
00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:56.020
its direction.

108
00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:57.730
Once again you can do the same thing from here.

109
00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:05.720
You can change the alignment like that what you can do from this from here is the type of label and

110
00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:10.610
the type of numerical label that we're using in this case we're using numbers.

111
00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:14.600
So let's go ahead and change that to currency.

112
00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:16.760
Let's say we want dollars.

113
00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:22.820
So we'll go to currency custom as you can see is automatically moved because it's not fitting.

114
00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:24.850
But we'll take out two decimal points.

115
00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:34.280
And now you can see that this is much more appealing it's got the dollar sign in it and now also let's

116
00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:37.550
say we want in units of thousands.

117
00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:41.510
So let's say K and we'll add one decimal point back.

118
00:08:41.810 --> 00:08:43.330
So that's even better.

119
00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:46.780
So now we can see approximately how much cell these persons made.

120
00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:53.630
It's very very easy to digest there's no numbers that you know that are unnecessary.

121
00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:58.320
One thing you should be aware of is you can't really change the font size through this menu.

122
00:08:58.310 --> 00:09:01.910
Here you see I'm trying to change the font size but it's not changing.

123
00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:07.670
And that's that's something just like a feature of tableau that hasn't been looked at.

124
00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:13.250
That's because the label font size actually overrides the font size that you see here.

125
00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:15.690
So be careful that OK.

126
00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:17.710
So we've formatted the label.

127
00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:20.050
Now what else we're going to do is we're going to format the axis.

128
00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:24.340
So we're going to right click on the axis once again format.

129
00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:28.150
We're going to go to axis here and we're going to change this to 12.

130
00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:35.070
So kind of it's best to keep the size consistent throughout.

131
00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:36.540
Then we'll go to this axis.

132
00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:42.030
We'll also click format and we'll change this to 12.

133
00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:44.050
You can see that Matthew is not fitting in.

134
00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:46.600
So maybe make this a little bit bigger.

135
00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:54.410
Now Matthew fits in as well format this axis changes to 12.

136
00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:59.580
This is actually unnecessary because we know that central means region and we know that these people

137
00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:00.200
are representative.

138
00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:06.750
So we'll just right click and we will hide fuel labels and total sales one more thing.

139
00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:12.700
So here we will right click edit access.

140
00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:19.590
We will split total sales by the two words because that looks better.

141
00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:23.030
And also one more thing in if we edit access or not.

142
00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:28.760
Edit Sorry we reformat the access and we go to access here what we want to do is we want to make sure

143
00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:38.170
that these are also dollars so currency get rid of that make it k and there we go.

144
00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:43.850
So now it's it's consistent you've got KS here also you.

145
00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:49.090
It would be better to probably put one decimal place back because there is one decimal place throughout

146
00:10:49.090 --> 00:10:56.320
the chart and that's how we form our charts in the next material we will look at how do we how we can

147
00:10:56.320 --> 00:11:01.000
export this chart into other documents and eloquent seeing next.

148
00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:03.130
Until then happy it.
