So when you my daughter that basis,

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.930
you will sit on the stock databases to create it,

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:25.460
ever simply type speculate three and some of its named RTB and then you know that this will

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:26.240
get created.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.520
