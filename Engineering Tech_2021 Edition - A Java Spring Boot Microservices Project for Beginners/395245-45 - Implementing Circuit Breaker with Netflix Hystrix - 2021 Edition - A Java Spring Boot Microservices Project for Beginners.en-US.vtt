00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.930
we'll come back.

00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:07.190
Or let's understand how to implement our circuit breaker on the course catalog service so

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:13.590
that it can handle any failure in the course up So you can go to the course catalog project

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.590
and make required changes in the bomber.

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.790
Excitement are you understand what dependency we,

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.890
too,

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.530
are for the sticks ever.

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:26.660
Let's download a dummy project from starters Finger.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.110
Do you sorry for his streaks.

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:33.920
It's currently fundamentalists might be getting phased out.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.380
I'm sure a better solution will be provided for circuit breaker with spring clothes,

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.890
so let's use it for the painting.

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:49.120
We just need to see what dependency needs to be our right our to make our course,

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.430
catalog up a new circuit breaking.

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.070
Let's open the former XML.

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:59.000
We can see that there is a dependency Netflix his tricks.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.700
So that's the one we need.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.360
Skopje Tender pastry in the Bomber XML In course catalog.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.720
Spring Cloud starter.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.800
Netflix is streets that's third pregnancy.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:20.320
Now here we need to harder and an impatient for historic circuit breaker sanitation is

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.650
enable circuit breaker.

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.940
It takes some time for drought in diligently.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.840
Download all the jar finds as soon as you are their dependency.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:35.170
Mammon would look for the required and once the jeffren started intelligible,

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:36.830
automatically problem you OAS.

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:43.210
Soon as you start typing for interval circuit breaker just started and the classes we get

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:44.250
important also.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.610
Now let's go to the method which needs to go second.

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.390
Taking will implement it on the home pitch.

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:57.020
So there's a history command 100 patient that regard on Would.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.510
It does specify worked fall back method.

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:04.100
So let's add a new fallback matter card display,

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.950
home page or display default home bitch.

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.380
And whenever there is a connection,

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.530
failure course up is doubt.

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.050
Then that would be a fallback matter,

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:16.700
and we can return.

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.010
Some are text from that metal,

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.640
so that's it.

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.300
That's the way we implement a circuit breaker.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.400
We just put some dummy message.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.080
Please try up for some time.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.970
So the court sap is running.

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.190
The Children's is for the course.

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.400
Upwardly display are the wage.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.840
This message will be displayed.

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.860
We'll check it out shortly.

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.990
Similarly,

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:41.070
you can do it in the other cards also,

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:45.980
but let's tried out the homepage now.

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:46.630
Just done it.

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:52.820
So it restarted.

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.230
Let's sort of fresh stoppage.

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:59.030
You can see that please strap for some time that Mrs getting printed from the point back.

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.610
It's going to start the course up.

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:02.050
No.

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:04.170
So when course up is down,

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.840
the fallback mentor discard When course up is running,

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.050
it should give us the message from the course up so you can see that.

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:20.770
Let's again shut a door and it goes back to the fallback mentor.

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:25.670
So that is how you can implement circuit breaker.

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:30.130
You can tell one now what to do in case another up is not available.
