00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:05.220
To build applications using Java programming language,

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.325
we require the JDK or Java Development Kit.

00:00:08.325 --> 00:00:11.470
Let's see how to install JDK.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.150
Search for JDK Download.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.630
And you will find a link for the Oracle website.

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.195
This is your 3021,

00:00:21.195 --> 00:00:23.800
though there are higher versions of Java.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.670
Jdk is the widely-used worsen in

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.760
most real-world production applications will be using Java eight and dedicate.

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.655
And if we choose to use GATK 11 or any higher version,

00:00:35.655 --> 00:00:40.630
the code that you're going to see in this course is also going to work in those worsens.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.280
Take if Java is already installed on your machine,

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.870
go to a command prompt.

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.435
Type Java space does Watson.

00:00:52.435 --> 00:00:56.480
We can see that Java is not installed on this machine.

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:02.365
Will download the report with worsened Pardo Windows machine,

00:01:02.365 --> 00:01:05.870
you can choose the right one for your operating system.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.255
Will ask you to sign in.

00:01:10.255 --> 00:01:11.770
If you do not have an Oracle ID,

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.730
you can create one. After dark.

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:20.090
You can download and simply click and install.

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.640
You can keep the default path and click Next.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:35.140
After installing opening new command prompt and type java space does Watson.

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.785
And you should see the Java version that you've just installed.

00:01:38.785 --> 00:01:45.040
Before that unit to ensure Java jar it to your system environment variables.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.849
Search and click on Edit system environment variables.

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.150
Click on Environment Variables.

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.510
Click on part, and then edit.

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:04.225
Click new. And RDC Program Files Java,

00:02:04.225 --> 00:02:09.470
and buy whatever dedicates a new user up to the bin directory, to the path.
