00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.360
Welcome back in this love will understand how to dynamically refresh the changes in the

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:09.250
properties file in order and payment service up without restarting them.

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:13.450
Let's go to Bombard XML.

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:16.950
We are their spring actuator while creating this projects.

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.080
Now,

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.420
spring actuator provides an n in point or you are using which we can repress.

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.040
The changes in the properties fail,

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:30.350
so we'll see that in this particular lab now to enable the refresh will have to make two

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:30.850
changes.

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:34.350
First thing is we have toe expose their in points.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.530
We can expose specific Spring Exeter in part,

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:39.390
or we can just wear,

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.850
start and expose all endpoints.

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:50.710
We cannot refresh Corp annotation with a *** class which we want to refresh at the wrong

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:51.150
time.

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:57.480
So we have one controller here will add refresh cope without control class so that when we

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.380
refresh using the endpoint,

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:04.750
the properties that are getting referred in this particular country plus will get refreshed

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.750
.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.030
We'll do that in just with that payment.

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:16.000
Cultural arap also are referenced school validation and also exports all endpoints.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:25.030
So these are the changes required for us to refresh the properties,

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:31.190
file changes at their own time without restarting that we're using spring actually

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:40.310
dependency to achieve this gets run board ABS conflicts,

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.130
every still running finest.

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.630
It's facing words and three now because you've restarted the order,

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.950
order and payment up would also become person three.

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.770
So this is all fine.

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:57.670
Next will make changes to the properties file and see how we can refresh those values in

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:58.990
the order and prevent.

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:07.020
Our services also will change the worsen toe four in both order and payment service

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.580
properties fine and commit.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:20.950
These two fights to the get up repository simply applauded and coming Spring cloud

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.320
configured reflect the changes immediately.

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:24.350
As you have seen earlier,

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.980
you can see worse than four in both order and payment service.

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:29.780
Property spell.

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.940
Now let's refresh order and payment service EPS.

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.220
It's still showing worse.

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.250
Country does not picked up that changes.

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.840
Now let's understand how auto refresh.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.950
Using that spring actuator project,

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.250
we'll go to the post rental.

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.870
It should as a health important,

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.520
using which you can see the status of that simply do extra.

00:02:52.520 --> 00:03:01.100
This last health you can see that it's displaying bowed abs are running to the 1st 3% a

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:07.730
post request with empty body using extracted slash refresh you are in and it really water

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.350
the values which have changed.

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:10.870
So in this case,

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.580
the service not will come back.

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.930
Mrs.

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:13.850
That has changed.

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:17.250
So it's showing with that,

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:18.970
and it is the first of all,

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:19.160
Lou,

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.980
and you can refresh the page and see worsen.

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:28.070
For similarly let's her first of a loop of the payment out to classic shooters.

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.840
Lots of fresh.

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.930
It shows the property that has been modified life.

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:34.880
Refresh the page.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:41.610
You should she worsen for So we are able toe reflect the changes in both art and parents

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.660
that it's up without restarting them wherever they achieve it.

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.190
Using spring a church,

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.080
the fresh import.

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.320
If we tried out a fresh again,

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.600
it will show you no change because you're not modified.

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.110
The properties fail again.

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:57.150
Let's try it out.

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.190
We'll see bland because we're not mortified anything.

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.140
So this is how we condone amicably,

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:08.770
reflect changes in the properties file in various micro services.

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:13.770
Now you can automate thesis tape so that every time we're checking in a file to the gate

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:14.570
repository,

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:15.490
that shooter,

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:21.180
the fresh and party are being book and the changes will get reflected to some rays.

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.050
We've understood how to manage properties.

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.750
File using spring cloud conflicts are worried,

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:26.950
a central repository.

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:32.410
And then we've also seen how to read the property's felt on the Spring Cloud Convict server

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:34.650
and use it in various micro services.

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:39.480
We have seen Global Properties file an application that properties we should stop global

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:40.060
values.

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:44.690
And we've also seen a properties file which can store Microsoft specific values.

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:49.650
We've also seen out of difference properties file change in various micro services.

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.150
Thank you.
