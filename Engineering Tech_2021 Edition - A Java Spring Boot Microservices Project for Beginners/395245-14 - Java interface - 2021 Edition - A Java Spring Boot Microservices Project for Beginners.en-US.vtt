00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.810
Let's understand another concept called interface.

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.910
Interface contents, empty method,

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:11.920
and any class that is based upon that interface must implement those methods.

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:18.195
For example, we can have a animal interface and then define sudden behavior.

00:00:18.195 --> 00:00:21.885
And then dog and cat must implement those behaviors.

00:00:21.885 --> 00:00:24.180
So let's see it in action,

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.890
will create a new project.

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:35.830
We'll select the type of Java JDK is getting selected.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:42.470
Let's call it future ex project two will change

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:47.420
the directory and you give the complete path to the project location,

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.205
including the project name.

00:00:49.205 --> 00:00:53.520
Then it will project directory with whatever name we specify it.

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.080
Let's go to the SRC folder and create a new Java class.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:11.540
We'll call it future ex hoops demo to let's add a main method.

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.400
Then artist system out.

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:23.820
And say future ex project two will run it.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.140
So it's running fine.

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:33.785
Let's now Arden interface will select Java class.

00:01:33.785 --> 00:01:40.350
We'll create an interface with Mmm animal and select the type is interface.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.610
Interface coordinates, black methods.

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.635
Let's hard and new meter wide mix sound.

00:01:48.635 --> 00:01:51.770
So this method will not return anything.

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:59.285
But any class which implements this interface must implement the mics on metadata.

00:01:59.285 --> 00:02:03.000
So let's now add a new class called Dog.

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.685
And we'll say implements animal.

00:02:07.685 --> 00:02:10.115
But in every times we said extent,

00:02:10.115 --> 00:02:12.440
put interface will have to say implements.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.360
We got an error because it says you have not implemented the mixin method.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.325
So let's do that intelligent promptly with the method signature.

00:02:22.325 --> 00:02:26.750
So let's select that will remove the override annotation for now.

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.980
We'll come back to it later.

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.140
Now let's put a system out within this.

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:41.375
And we'll say, well, let's go to the main class.

00:02:41.375 --> 00:02:46.530
Now. Inside the main class, let's instantiate dog.

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:58.110
And then we'll say dog one. Makes sound.

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:06.575
Let's run it. We forgot to add parenthesis.

00:03:06.575 --> 00:03:11.045
We'll run it again. Now is getting printed.

00:03:11.045 --> 00:03:14.070
Let's add another class.

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.460
And we'll say implements animal.

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.855
Here also will have to.

00:03:23.855 --> 00:03:27.560
Metadata will give a lower rate.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:34.050
For now. Let's have a system out Mill.

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.860
And let's know instantiate that got glass.

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:48.030
And we'll invoke dot mix on laptop gat object.

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.550
Let's run it now.

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:58.620
Mao is getting printed.
