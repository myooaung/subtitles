00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.390
So we have a course application ready,

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:06.430
which connects to the back and get our best.

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:11.170
And we are able to do all kind of Travis operation and themselves creating Certainly.

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.480
Now let's see how to export this project with JAR file,

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.840
which can be executed in each other in a moment.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:17.810
First,

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:19.550
let's stopped application.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:28.080
There's a raid I can hear which you can click and stop running up in Inteligencia Mavin

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:28.350
Link.

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:29.440
On the right hand side,

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.460
Select darken Pick on him,

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.350
which is Executive Mammon Goal and such for Ambien Package,

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.180
which is the Mavin package manager.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.940
So you click on that.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.300
It would start leading a jar file off your application.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:51.340
It will download all the required that jar finds have into them all the Springwood,

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.370
our dependency jars or any other jobs that because it might be using So this file size

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.510
would be little use around 30 to 48 beat.

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.780
So you have this future fails,

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.450
but it'll come in all the jar files called the Target folder,

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:07.450
and you can see the Courts up jar file,

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.110
which got generated not this job condone in any job moment.

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:18.550
There's a terminal tab here you can go there and create a new terminal and go to the target

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.930
for lead.

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:26.930
And there you'll see the jar file course up supports a number and Jack stop certain larger

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.180
now using Java minus jar.

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.260
You can execute it,

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:37.530
and this would run in any environment in on any machine where Charlize there is a self

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.440
contained application.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:39.270
Some windows,

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.780
promicin regret.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:41.230
Pop pop.

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:42.870
Let's kick Okay,

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.450
you may not get it in your machine,

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:52.050
not Goto Postman and involved the service.

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:58.210
It gives a mirror because it's not able to find the good habits so that Travis was under

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:59.830
the main course Fulla,

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:05.140
and you'll see that it's saying missing that of its because we're running it now with the

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.800
target for them.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.790
Either we can move the religious to the Target folder,

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:17.120
or we can run the jar file from the course of four in another environment,

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.590
deliberate.

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.770
Sure,

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.150
the database is set up,

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.490
and every level of the same directors the project.

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:30.750
Now we're running it from the quarter folder and we'll say targets plus the jar file.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:31.550
It will find a job,

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.480
and you'll also find our database.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:41.010
It the same for Leonard run find this time now wearable DuPage data fits with speaking a

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.470
guard.

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.910
Do delete into all kind of operation usually,

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:45.440
Joffrey.
