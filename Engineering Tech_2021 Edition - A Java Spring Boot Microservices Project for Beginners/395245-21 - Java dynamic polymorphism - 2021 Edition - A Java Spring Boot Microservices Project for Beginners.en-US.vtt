00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:04.845
Let's understand dynamic polymorphism in this lab,

00:00:04.845 --> 00:00:06.795
you have earlier seen method overloading,

00:00:06.795 --> 00:00:10.215
which is a static polymorphism, are compile-time polymorphism.

00:00:10.215 --> 00:00:13.275
Dynamic polymorphism is runtime Baldwin.

00:00:13.275 --> 00:00:16.899
Let's understand through some examples.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.320
We have an animal interface and gotten dog classes.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.700
At implementing that interface.

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:31.560
We are instantiating the dog and cat class and using them.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.360
Now let's comment out this code.

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:48.030
We can also instantiate the dog with diabetes anymore.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.160
So instead of dog one,

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.080
let's make it anyway, L1.

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.910
So this MML e1 is of type animal.

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:03.860
But then when we instantiate,

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:09.300
we can say it is it whether it's a dog or a cat? Let's run this.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.590
Now is getting invoked because while

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.880
instantiating we are seeing is a dog and if we change it to cat.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.085
Now mu is good invoke.

00:01:25.085 --> 00:01:27.650
So this is dynamic polymorphism,

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.335
though animal One is of any type.

00:01:30.335 --> 00:01:33.890
But depending on what glass we instantiate it to,

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.120
it takes that form.

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.835
You can also have dynamic polymorphism with inheritance.

00:01:40.835 --> 00:01:43.340
If we change this to a class.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.650
And if we give an implementation here.

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:02.849
And instead of implements will say extends.

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:11.370
And similarly in the getClass extents.

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:19.740
So now we have an animal class and then dog and cat start extending the animal class.

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.330
And this would work is we put

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:31.160
dynamic polymer which can be implemented with both the Americans and the interface.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.520
And any Malkin also take the form of a minimum.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:39.150
If we run this makes on of the Animal class will get invoked.
