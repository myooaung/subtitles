00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:03.840
Before we dive into microservices,

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.010
let's understand service or web service in the internet world.

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:14.800
Web service is a software that makes it available over the Internet.

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.420
A web service can be accessed over HTTP,

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.445
FTP, and many other protocols.

00:00:20.445 --> 00:00:23.760
Typically, data is exchanged in XML or JSON format.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.995
Now, in the real world you'll see many examples of web service.

00:00:28.995 --> 00:00:31.185
For example, in the Adelaide might exported

00:00:31.185 --> 00:00:35.550
ticket availability status to a travel portal through web service.

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.660
It doesn't need to give the travel portal direct taxes to its database.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.020
A popular way of accessing web service.

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.385
Rest starts to a representative state transport using raced,

00:00:49.385 --> 00:00:53.390
you can access the web service and access data in XML or JSON format.

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.495
Json format is more widely used.

00:00:56.495 --> 00:00:59.135
There's some contents key-value pair.

00:00:59.135 --> 00:01:01.340
Any application which wants to extract data from

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.830
a web service can get a JSON response and

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.500
directly read that response or convert that with

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.170
class and object and then read the response.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:16.500
In this course, we'll be interacting between different microservices through wrist.
