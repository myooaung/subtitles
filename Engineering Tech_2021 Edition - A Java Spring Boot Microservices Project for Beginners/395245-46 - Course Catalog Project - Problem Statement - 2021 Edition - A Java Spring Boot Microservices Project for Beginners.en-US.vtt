00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Welcome back.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.940
It's time for the final course project work Till now we build a course catalogue service,

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:11.550
and we have pulled information from course up service to rest.

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.200
Simply now,

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.670
we need to announce this application is part of the project.

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:18.970
What were the user up service with its own database?

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:20.220
For each course,

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.050
you'll find the corresponding indoor leisure information in the user of service.

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.340
So it's part of this project.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.510
You will be building another micro service and integrating both the course of service and

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:33.870
use it up service with a course catalog studies.

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.190
So,

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:41.350
given that plan and will be visiting the solution for this project in the subsequent laughs

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:41.350
,

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:42.350
Thank you.
