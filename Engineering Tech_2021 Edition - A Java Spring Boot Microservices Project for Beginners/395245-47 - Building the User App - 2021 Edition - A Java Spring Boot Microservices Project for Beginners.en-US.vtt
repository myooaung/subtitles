00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.430
Welcome back or we'll be building a user up in this lab will select Spring Web spring that

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:11.320
a J P A rest repository and the uric Our Discovery Clan.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:16.440
Pretty much all the dependencies that we heard in the course up we're selecting here and

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.650
downloading the Starter project from spring website.

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:27.920
Extract the file and loaded too intelligent project from existing search and select the

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:28.550
folder,

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.910
then select May 1.

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:32.490
Built all.

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:37.600
And while the application is getting loaded,

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:38.930
let's create a new red abyss.

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:44.310
Will have a future ex user BB and will create a table called Our User,

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:45.740
which will have first like User I d.

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:46.120
Course.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:46.680
I'd use a name.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.680
Very clever Composite primary key Communists and abuser idea in course ideas.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.390
Primary keys Because one user content before the same court certain place.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.910
Let's insert some dummy records.

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.850
You can see that the combination of user idea in course I d.

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.550
Their unique We have four records.

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:13.030
Let's try to insert a combination off user Radian cause,

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:14.330
and each already exist.

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:22.050
You can see that gave her or late so we have the user table ready now and we'll go back to

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.920
the map and let's look at the job filed.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.750
The main job will be large derecha client innovation.

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:39.310
And then let's clear the user class so this class will not toe around it.

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:40.350
A vestibule user.

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.490
Now let's are the usual and,

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.600
er patients for a DB entity.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.120
Jason Ignore properties.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.150
And then we have a I D.

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:51.360
Class sanitation,

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.430
which is required for a composite key,

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.600
will come back to compose it.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.850
Keeter class later.

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.610
Let's are the other Fields say it has to master field names.

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:01.900
He's already course i D.

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.450
And there was a name.

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.650
Whatever name is there in the database makes your same name you're using here.

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:13.150
And since we have communities and abuse their idea in course ideas,

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.610
the primary keys,

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.650
whoever composite primary key we need to give an innovation on Bodo fills.

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.510
So let's add idea notation on both user Radian.

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:29.350
Corsetti will now make sure all the classes are important.

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:43.540
Let's are the default user constructor and we love generate gator and second methods select

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:54.850
all three feels let's now are the usual repository class.

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.670
It needs to extend from the GP repository.

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:04.110
So pretty much the same state that we did in the courts up and we'll have user are in

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.250
Turkey and begin digital type is parameters.

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.100
And now let's have the controller class.

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:16.340
We learned the wrist controller annotation,

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.980
and let's are them May 3rd also to get all the users,

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:27.920
so that would point to the root directory and the return type would be a list of users now

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.920
,

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.840
using the usual repository find all we can get.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:40.780
All the records are the order wear down tradition That should be.

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.890
We can use this method to fetch all users from the database.

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:51.700
We'll go to the applications under properties and guard whatever properties we add it to

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.450
the courts up project.

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:58.840
Let's open that and copy all the properties from there and will make the required changes

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.170
that a first name would be.

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:05.220
You should excuse the baby that started.

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.710
It is that we created for this up and I will give to stop it name.

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:11.660
It could be a fixed usual service.

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:13.150
And let's use a different port.

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:14.020
So this is important.

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:15.030
All Microsoft sister,

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.950
That there one port.

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:19.190
Now let's run it.

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.010
It's notable toe.

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:22.600
Find a Nibali record plant.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.450
Let's start entering the import.

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.560
This could be repeated her.

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.050
So let's run it again and see what else is there.

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:37.140
Composite key.

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:40.650
Let's give user dark class and see what happens.

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.980
I'll tell you the solution later,

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:44.600
but for your understanding,

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.790
just think watcher with the trade class that I d.

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:51.390
Class I don't it again.

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:54.290
Or the usual repositories would be an interface,

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:55.220
not class.

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:56.950
It's getting that.

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:58.370
Run it again.

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:01.500
Now it seems to be running.

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:12.210
We're diggin failed because it's not able to connect to the database.

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:14.050
So let's hard uh,

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:15.060
the sequel,

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:21.500
Late dependencies will again copied from the courts our project sequel.

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.160
It very busy and circulate dialect.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:29.380
This true dependence is not to be added to the partner XML than important changes are due

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:30.150
order import.

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.550
We'll run it again.

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:35.050
Could fail again.

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:39.270
Now let's make the required changes for the composite key.

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:42.350
Let's name it is user I D.

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:45.580
And we learned user radian course I D,

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:48.190
which are part of the composite key to this class.

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:51.670
So this is the way GP and hibernate Kwok's.

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:54.980
You look to specify class,

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:55.450
uh,

00:05:55.450 --> 00:06:00.930
with the I d class sanitation and that class would have all the fields of the composite

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:01.250
keys.

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:11.530
Now Children fade it again failed because they usually class must implement.

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:12.360
See realizable.

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:16.450
Soc Realizable is a concept using is you can convert object to finally former.

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:20.870
That's the way the class has been designed without getting too much into the details of it

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:20.870
.

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:24.070
Now it seems to be learning,

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:26.210
though it's notable registered with the record server,

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:26.840
that is fine.

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:31.730
We can running is a standalone up and directly and walked upto.

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:32.350
Sit out.

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:36.660
Let's call local law Star Age Original three.

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:42.190
We can see that all the user i D End Course I D records are getting face from the database

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:42.190
.
