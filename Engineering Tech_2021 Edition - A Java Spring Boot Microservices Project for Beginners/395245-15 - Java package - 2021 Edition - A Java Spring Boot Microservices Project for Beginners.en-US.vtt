00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.530
Using package, you can organize these set of classes or interfaces.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.090
Package is nothing but a folder on your computer.

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.500
Let's see how it works.

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.200
Till now we have been creating all our classes and interfaces,

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.340
a 100, the SRC folder,

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.570
which is the default package,

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.410
but we can create subdirectories or package under this.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.140
In intelligence. A right-click on SRC,

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.780
click New, then click package.

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.680
Let's give it a name.

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:37.035
We'll create a package with men come.

00:00:37.035 --> 00:00:41.200
And it created a package calm under SRC.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:50.045
And also create package with.com dot future X dot java.

00:00:50.045 --> 00:00:53.375
There'll be subdirectory future Xander calm,

00:00:53.375 --> 00:00:57.090
and under future ECS, there'll be a directory called Java.

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.100
So it created com dot fugal x-dot Java.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.870
And let's add a class a 100.

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.370
This will call it cow.

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:16.590
And you can see that the package name com dot future x-dot Java that is appearing here.

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:24.950
We can also move these classes and interfaces to the new package.

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.625
You can select and simply drag.

00:01:28.625 --> 00:01:34.205
And intelligent would automatically refactor and hardware package name.

00:01:34.205 --> 00:01:37.505
Now everything is under configured exit Java,

00:01:37.505 --> 00:01:40.940
Italy's is automatically added the package name.

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.864
You can create multiple packages.

00:01:43.864 --> 00:01:45.830
Let's add another one.

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:52.410
We'll call it model. And we'll create a class under it.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.620
So this class is under

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:03.570
the model package and the other classes around other future ex Java package.

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.590
Let's see how it is stored on the machine.

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:13.385
We'll open the project folder and under restarts you will find calm,

00:02:13.385 --> 00:02:15.620
then future extend Java.

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.274
So it created three sub directories.

00:02:18.274 --> 00:02:20.555
And then we can see all the classes here.

00:02:20.555 --> 00:02:26.345
And for more than one class which is available directly under the model folder.

00:02:26.345 --> 00:02:29.885
Let's run the main class now.

00:02:29.885 --> 00:02:32.195
It runs fine.

00:02:32.195 --> 00:02:34.220
And if you go to the outer directory,

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:39.330
you'll see a similar package structure for the dark class files.
