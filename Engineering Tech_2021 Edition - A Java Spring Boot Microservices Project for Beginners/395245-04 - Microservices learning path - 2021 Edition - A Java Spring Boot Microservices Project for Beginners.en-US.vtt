00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:04.350
Let's understand how we'll go about building

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.260
a Java springboard microservices project from scratch.

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:12.735
Will start our journey with the Java basics.

00:00:12.735 --> 00:00:16.950
We'll install IntelliJ and learn some of the language basics.

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:21.070
Then we'll dive into springboard and Spring framework.

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.860
Once you are comfortable with springboard and Spring framework,

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.790
then you'll jump into building microservices using spring cloud.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:37.315
And then finally, we'll apply all our learning to build a Course Catalog app.

00:00:37.315 --> 00:00:40.040
And we'll also learn some of the advanced concepts of

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.620
micro services such as dynamic routing,

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.725
EPA gateway, and client-side Load Balancing.

00:00:45.725 --> 00:00:48.500
One question you might have is whether you can start with

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.305
Spring Boot without any Spring framework knowledge.

00:00:51.305 --> 00:00:53.405
The answer to that is yes.

00:00:53.405 --> 00:00:57.125
Spring framework has evolved quite a bit about the last ten years,

00:00:57.125 --> 00:00:59.810
Spring Boot has simplified Zhao programming.

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:03.140
You do not need to understand how Spring used to work in the older days.

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.510
To get started with Spring boot.

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:10.505
With spring cloud, you can easily implement a microservices based application.

00:01:10.505 --> 00:01:13.655
Spring cloud is open source like the Spring framework.

00:01:13.655 --> 00:01:16.415
Spring cloud is optimized for Spring Boot,

00:01:16.415 --> 00:01:18.260
but you can use it in other frameworks.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:24.140
Also. Once you have built a Spring Boot spring cloud microservices,

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.460
you can easily run it locally or ticket to a cloud environment and execute their.

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.540
Many of the libraries that you'll see in

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.920
spring cloud were originally developed by the P bit Netflix.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.225
When they tried to build a huge monolithic application for their website,

00:01:41.225 --> 00:01:45.560
they faced many challenges and then they came up with many design patterns.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.790
Spring cloud at upgrade goes design patterns and make them open source.

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:55.680
Let's dive in, setup a development environment and then get going with Zhao programming.
