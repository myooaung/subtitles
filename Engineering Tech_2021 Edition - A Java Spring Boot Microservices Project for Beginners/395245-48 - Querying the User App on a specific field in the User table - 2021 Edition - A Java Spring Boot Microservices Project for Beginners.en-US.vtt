00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.770
Welcome back The previous lab,

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:07.170
you saw how to fetch all the records from a table having a composite key.

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.790
We used the usual repository Final method,

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:12.330
which is a JP repository,

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.150
are method to get all the records and in the course up earlier,

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:20.940
we used get one I D method are too quickly on the primary key field,

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.280
but in this case,

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.440
we have a composite key in the user table.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:26.050
Use your idea.

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:26.730
Of course I d.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.050
So let's understand how to quit.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.610
You are either use a ready or course idea or,

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:31.210
for that matter,

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:32.070
on any field.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.000
So it is really simple.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.100
All you could do is in the GPS positively hard,

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:43.840
a new method find by in the Field Name and jpn High Vonette Take care about generating all

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.370
the back inquiries and functionality required for this Get of this interaction.

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.010
For example,

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:50.970
for user Raby,

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:52.700
we can never find by usual ready.

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:57.300
Make sure use already matches with the column name and it could take begin Terrorism

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.850
Parliament because that stuff type and we can get a list of your just back.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:03.210
So that's it.

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.830
That's the chain that's required.

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.010
Now we can invoke this function in the controller are to get it after a specific use.

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.380
Ready?

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.760
Let's Adam 1/3 with the required annotation,

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:17.350
So we simply used positively find babies Radiometer under to get that back.

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:28.070
Let's make sure all classes are important and then on it get sued as a commander is not

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.610
required.

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.850
Let's fix that on it again.

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:31.670
Here.

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.400
Now you can see that we're able to get up for a specific user ready.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.420
He's already won.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:42.380
We can very fend it off all the records on the records with use already one God fetched.

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:43.730
Similarly,

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:45.260
we can try for user ready to.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:52.450
There is only one user user ready to and were able to face that.

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.690
But for our project,

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.450
we need to face users for this wispy course.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.980
So let's are another matter for that will say fine by Corsetti.

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:09.620
Now this method can take courts,

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:19.190
ideas the perimeter and return the list of users coming again.

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.250
A restructured let's check it out.

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.950
So when we search for who I didn't do it fetches all the records with courtside Ito.

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:28.770
And similarly,

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:29.610
for one,

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.200
it is all the records with course,

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.750
everyone.

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.890
So that's all in this lab,

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.340
you have seen how toe quickly on a specific column.

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.570
You can try it out on any column in the user table.

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:45.450
All you do is decide defined by a column name method in the usual positively interface,

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.300
which extends the JP repository.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:48.550
Thank you.
