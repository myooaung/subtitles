00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.735
Java is an object-oriented programming language.

00:00:03.735 --> 00:00:09.130
Classes and objects at the core of object oriented concepts.

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:12.420
Class is a blueprint prototype.

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.135
And object is an instance of class.

00:00:15.135 --> 00:00:20.865
Class defines what statin behavior and objects should have.

00:00:20.865 --> 00:00:25.590
For example, let Doc and a name and color it states and

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.105
barking and working Tellus behaviors. For a customer.

00:00:30.105 --> 00:00:31.410
The state can be name,

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.740
age for number, and its behavior can be walking, got buying.

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:43.350
Let's look at a simple example to understand the concepts of classes and objects.

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.480
Let's create a new Java class.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.980
So under the same eugenic genuine project will create a new Java class.

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.360
Let's call it future ex, oops,

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.120
demo, who stands but object-oriented programming.

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:08.570
Now within this main method,

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.920
I will just put a print statement.

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.545
So let's run it. And by default,

00:01:21.545 --> 00:01:24.170
the new class will not appear here.

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.930
You can run it by clicking on this icon,

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:34.620
or you can go to Edit configuration and change the class name here.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.200
Now you should be able to run eugenics,

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.490
oops, demo from here.

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.630
So this class got executed.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.580
Let's add a new class called Dog.

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.080
And within that we have three variables.

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.370
And usually the variables are declared as

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:11.330
private and the nuclear public methods to access them.

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:17.330
Let's say name, colon,

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.140
and a double type height.

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:26.150
Now this class has three variables or three properties.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.570
So we can generate method to access these properties.

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.035
Now to generate the access methods for these variables,

00:02:36.035 --> 00:02:38.915
right-click and click Generate,

00:02:38.915 --> 00:02:45.335
and then select getter and setter to select the three variables.

00:02:45.335 --> 00:02:48.170
And click OK. Now

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.430
intelligence generated getter and setter methods for each of these variables.

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.670
And these are public methods by default.

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.900
So anyone wants to access the properties of dog can

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.730
access through this member variables and the variables are kept private.

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:10.830
Now let's see how to instantiate this dot glass and create different objects.

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:16.770
Let's go back to the main future excerpt demo class.

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.140
Let's instantiate dog.

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:27.820
The instance name will be dog Jack equals new dog should.

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.880
This is how we instantiate a class in Java.

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.705
Dog is the class and dog Jack is though object,

00:03:34.705 --> 00:03:36.655
which is of type Dog.

00:03:36.655 --> 00:03:41.829
Now we can invoke the set methods and said different properties.

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:43.240
For example, we can say,

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:52.100
say it height is 1.2 and said name Jack,

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:59.980
and said colored black.

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.940
This though, we can create an object from a class and said different properties.

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:16.770
Now you can use the get method to retrieve the print properties.

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.675
For example, dog Jack,

00:04:20.675 --> 00:04:26.700
colorist, dog Jack dot get color. Let's run this.

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:31.320
So we can see that colored black is getting printed.

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:38.855
Let's create another object. We'll copy this.

00:04:38.855 --> 00:04:45.090
And instead of dog Jack will say D2.

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.390
We can create multiple objects from a class.

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:57.000
And now we'll set different properties.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.180
Will have a different height,

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.550
different color, and different name.

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:07.560
And let's print the name of D2.

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:14.250
So we can do that by invoking dot getName method.

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:20.219
Let's change this to D2.

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:26.850
D2 name is getting printed.
