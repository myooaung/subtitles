00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.410
You can do all kind of arithmetic operations in Java.

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.110
Lets look at some examples.

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.920
We will open the same FusionX Java one project,

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:17.110
and within the helloworld class will try out different arithmetic operations.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.310
We can do addition,

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.760
subtraction,

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:38.560
multiplication, and division.

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.160
Let's run this.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:50.710
And we got 74 dietitian as expected and then minus 101200.

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.210
And for tardy wave for D,

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:57.370
we got the G20 because both 3040 Arab dessert types to get a decimal value,

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.495
we change one of them to her double lot, Florida.

00:01:01.495 --> 00:01:06.085
Let's make it 30 and now print it.

00:01:06.085 --> 00:01:09.130
And we will also print party weighed three,

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.050
which will give us an integer number.

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.560
Let's run it yet.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.420
So 430 by four D,

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.825
we got 0.75 because one of them is doubled.

00:01:19.825 --> 00:01:22.555
So the output is of double type.

00:01:22.555 --> 00:01:24.760
But for 30 by 40,

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.440
we gotta to do earlier.

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.300
And for 30 weight three,

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:33.625
we got we have modulus operation in Java.

00:01:33.625 --> 00:01:37.270
If we do 30 modulus eight,

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:38.860
we should get six.

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.350
That is the remainder. When you divide 30 weighed.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:48.865
Record six. Java has different equality operators,

00:01:48.865 --> 00:01:50.845
like equal, not equal,

00:01:50.845 --> 00:01:53.515
greater than, greater than equal to,

00:01:53.515 --> 00:01:55.195
less than, less than equal.

00:01:55.195 --> 00:01:57.175
We'll see some examples of those.

00:01:57.175 --> 00:01:59.995
And Java has conditional operators lake,

00:01:59.995 --> 00:02:04.900
and you can print output based on certain condition.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.760
Let's see some examples now.

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:14.720
Let's have as clean result will compare d

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:21.755
with d. And if it is true, we'll print alpha.

00:02:21.755 --> 00:02:25.200
Otherwise we will put into beta.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.060
And let's ended with a semicolon.

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.960
Let's print now

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.475
these n2 equal to 30,

00:02:52.475 --> 00:02:54.545
it should print beta.

00:02:54.545 --> 00:02:58.040
So this is how we convey the conditional operator in Java.

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.880
You can also achieve the same thing with a block, which you'll see later.

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:07.580
Now if we say four t naught equal to d,

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:14.520
then we should get alpha and regard alpha.

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.580
Similarly, we can track,

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:21.935
record them and regard alpha.

00:03:21.935 --> 00:03:24.260
Let's check out.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:34.895
And then our operations will save forties and fifties a 100.

00:03:34.895 --> 00:03:38.300
Then print alpha the ways print Beta.

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:42.000
Since we please not greater than 100, it'll print beta.

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.940
And if we change the R2R,

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.260
it should print alpha.

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.500
It printed alpha.

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:05.190
Similarly, you can try out our debt equality operations.
