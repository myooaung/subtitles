00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:05.355
Let's understand Java access modifier.

00:00:05.355 --> 00:00:08.175
Java has four different types of modifiers,

00:00:08.175 --> 00:00:11.760
public, predicted, nobody fair and private.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.150
And these modifiers are applied to a member variable.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.780
Automated targeting modifiers beside at

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:22.305
what level the variables or the methods will be accessible later.

00:00:22.305 --> 00:00:26.930
Class package, class are accessible to the entire world.

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:29.690
If a variable or method is public,

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:31.370
it is accessible everywhere.

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:35.999
Class packets subclass, end-to-end outside application.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.940
Protected members are not accessible outside the particular application.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.360
It's accessible at class Pakistan subclass levels.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.280
If there is no body fat,

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.755
it's accessible at class and pack is liberals.

00:00:48.755 --> 00:00:50.195
And if something is private,

00:00:50.195 --> 00:00:53.820
then it is accessible only to that particular class.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.140
Let us see some examples.

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:05.585
Let's start a new class. We'll call it.

00:01:05.585 --> 00:01:07.170
Of course.

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:16.460
We'll declare for variables with four different access modifiers that we just discussed.

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.390
Let's say public course name.

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:32.160
Then we'll have protected string name.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:45.060
Private int, number of reviews.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.440
We live with no mortified number of students.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:59.550
Let's now create another class called machine learning.

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.620
And we'll have it extend from the course.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:17.880
Now let's create another class which will be our starting point, Abduh demo.

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.620
We'll call it access demo.

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:31.170
Now let's go to the course class and create a constructor.

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:36.300
We leave me CLAs default variables within the constructor.

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.040
And we can access all the four variables

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.250
within the same class as where the access modifier charge.

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.050
Within the class, all four tapes are

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.800
accessible whether in the constructor or in any metadata.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.570
Let's initialize all four.

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:02.700
Now we learn a method called display details.

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:13.230
And let's have the return type is void and will simply print all four.

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.640
Now let's go to access demo and we'll

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:28.670
write the main method you can pay PS VM also hit Tab.

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.370
Recreate the main method.

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.340
We didn't that let's instantiate the course class.

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.795
Now we'll call coarse one dot display details.

00:03:41.795 --> 00:03:48.380
Let's run it. So it got

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:55.440
executed successfully and we're able to access all the variables with the courts class.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:01.820
Now let's go to this Machine Learning class and create a new method.

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:04.830
And we'll try to print all the values.

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:11.375
We can see that course name is accessible,

00:04:11.375 --> 00:04:14.780
autonomies accessible, number of twenties,

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.180
accessible, number of reviews is not accessible.

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.750
It's getting highlighted in red because that is private.

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:26.750
And it is all within the same package. This we cannot access.

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.220
The remaining three are accessible.

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.520
Let's instantiate this class.

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.520
We'll call it ML deployment.

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:49.020
And let's display the pills.

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.435
And we lard machine-learning here,

00:04:56.435 --> 00:05:06.270
just to know that the Machine Learning class, let's run it.

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:18.810
So we are able to access the public protected and the no modifier variables.

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:30.000
Now we'll go to the model package and cleared a class called Hadoop.

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:36.365
So this is in a different package, tandem course class.

00:05:36.365 --> 00:05:40.110
And we can extend course.

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.400
Since it is in a different package,

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:44.870
that package needs to be imported.

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:47.885
And IntelliJ geodata radically board that.

00:05:47.885 --> 00:05:53.075
It's saying there is no default constructor available in the course class.

00:05:53.075 --> 00:05:56.930
Though there is a constructor did not have any modifier.

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:59.900
So that's not accessible outside the package.

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:01.580
If we change it to public,

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:03.830
that data will go away.

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:06.080
Now in the Hadoop class,

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:09.155
you can ardor constructor and call super,

00:06:09.155 --> 00:06:14.700
which is a call to the constructor upto parent class to verify that is accessible.

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:18.350
And let's see if we are able to access

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:23.100
all the four variables from this class which is similar, different package.

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:27.680
So now we can see that number of students in number of reviews,

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:29.820
both are not accessible.

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:38.075
Number of Corinthians nor modified and now whatever the Bouazizi private modifier.

00:06:38.075 --> 00:06:43.235
So these two variables are not available outside the package.

00:06:43.235 --> 00:06:46.025
Some examples of access modifiers.

00:06:46.025 --> 00:06:49.295
And if we're working in an ID and Robert Lake in Delhi j,

00:06:49.295 --> 00:06:53.105
all the errors should be highlighted and you'll be suggested with the fixed.

00:06:53.105 --> 00:06:56.945
You really don't need to worry about whether you are setting something correctly or not.

00:06:56.945 --> 00:07:02.250
But it's good to have an understanding of how access modifiers work in Java.
