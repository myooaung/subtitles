00:00:00.000  -->  00:00:06.380
Hello and welcome back to the advanced

2

00:00:06.380  -->  00:00:06.390

3

00:00:06.390  -->  00:00:08.270
course on Tableau. In today's tutorial,

4

00:00:08.270  -->  00:00:08.280

5

00:00:08.280  -->  00:00:10.160
we're going to have a look at where to

6

00:00:10.160  -->  00:00:10.170

7

00:00:10.170  -->  00:00:12.499
get the data set and what the challenge

8

00:00:12.499  -->  00:00:12.509

9

00:00:12.509  -->  00:00:13.910
is for this section.

10

00:00:13.910  -->  00:00:13.920

11

00:00:13.920  -->  00:00:16.220
Alright so to get the data set as usual

12

00:00:16.220  -->  00:00:16.230

13

00:00:16.230  -->  00:00:18.170
we'll need a browser and we need to go

14

00:00:18.170  -->  00:00:18.180

15

00:00:18.180  -->  00:00:23.330
to www.superdatascience.com/tableau-advanced,

16

00:00:23.330  -->  00:00:23.340

17

00:00:23.340  -->  00:00:25.460
if you scroll down here to the bottom

18

00:00:25.460  -->  00:00:25.470

19

00:00:25.470  -->  00:00:28.730
you'll see section 6 level of detail

20

00:00:28.730  -->  00:00:28.740

21

00:00:28.740  -->  00:00:31.970
calculations. So the challenge PDF is

22

00:00:31.970  -->  00:00:31.980

23

00:00:31.980  -->  00:00:34.400
what we'll look at just now and then

24

00:00:34.400  -->  00:00:34.410

25

00:00:34.410  -->  00:00:36.650
making merchandise is the data set. So

26

00:00:36.650  -->  00:00:36.660

27

00:00:36.660  -->  00:00:38.479
let's have a look at the challenge so

28

00:00:38.479  -->  00:00:38.489

29

00:00:38.489  -->  00:00:41.000
this is our challenge for today, you have

30

00:00:41.000  -->  00:00:41.010

31

00:00:41.010  -->  00:00:42.770
been approached by a retail chain

32

00:00:42.770  -->  00:00:42.780

33

00:00:42.780  -->  00:00:44.779
operating in the US. They would like you

34

00:00:44.779  -->  00:00:44.789

35

00:00:44.789  -->  00:00:46.430
to recreate the visualization which is

36

00:00:46.430  -->  00:00:46.440

37

00:00:46.440  -->  00:00:48.380
depicted on the following page. Let's

38

00:00:48.380  -->  00:00:48.390

39

00:00:48.390  -->  00:00:51.229
have a look. This is a visualization that

40

00:00:51.229  -->  00:00:51.239

41

00:00:51.239  -->  00:00:54.680
they're like you to recreate and here

42

00:00:54.680  -->  00:00:54.690

43

00:00:54.690  -->  00:00:57.020
we've got two types of elements. We've

44

00:00:57.020  -->  00:00:57.030

45

00:00:57.030  -->  00:00:59.209
got the states, they're colored and the

46

00:00:59.209  -->  00:00:59.219

47

00:00:59.219  -->  00:01:01.729
circles. So let's have a look at the

48

00:01:01.729  -->  00:01:01.739

49

00:01:01.739  -->  00:01:04.280
notes. State colors represent the average

50

00:01:04.280  -->  00:01:04.290

51

00:01:04.290  -->  00:01:07.340
profit across the cities of that state.

52

00:01:07.340  -->  00:01:07.350

53

00:01:07.350  -->  00:01:10.940
So each state, if it's a dark blue that

54

00:01:10.940  -->  00:01:10.950

55

00:01:10.950  -->  00:01:13.429
means the average profit for the cities

56

00:01:13.429  -->  00:01:13.439

57

00:01:13.439  -->  00:01:16.789
in that state is high if it's red or

58

00:01:16.789  -->  00:01:16.799

59

00:01:16.799  -->  00:01:20.570
orange, it's negative and then circle

60

00:01:20.570  -->  00:01:20.580

61

00:01:20.580  -->  00:01:22.969
colors and sizes show the percent

62

00:01:22.969  -->  00:01:22.979

63

00:01:22.979  -->  00:01:25.550
contribution of the profit of the

64

00:01:25.550  -->  00:01:25.560

65

00:01:25.560  -->  00:01:28.100
respective city towards the overall

66

00:01:28.100  -->  00:01:28.110

67

00:01:28.110  -->  00:01:29.660
profit of the state.

68

00:01:29.660  -->  00:01:29.670

69

00:01:29.670  -->  00:01:32.030
So for instance in Wyoming we've only

70

00:01:32.030  -->  00:01:32.040

71

00:01:32.040  -->  00:01:35.240
got two cities, you can see this red large

72

00:01:35.240  -->  00:01:35.250

73

00:01:35.250  -->  00:01:38.330
circle signifies that that city had a

74

00:01:38.330  -->  00:01:38.340

75

00:01:38.340  -->  00:01:41.270
negative but very large contribution

76

00:01:41.270  -->  00:01:41.280

77

00:01:41.280  -->  00:01:43.249
towards that overall negative profit of

78

00:01:43.249  -->  00:01:43.259

79

00:01:43.259  -->  00:01:45.889
Wyoming. This city had a smaller but

80

00:01:45.889  -->  00:01:45.899

81

00:01:45.899  -->  00:01:48.560
positive contribution to that profit.

82

00:01:48.560  -->  00:01:48.570

83

00:01:48.570  -->  00:01:50.359
Let's have a look at another example for

84

00:01:50.359  -->  00:01:50.369

85

00:01:50.369  -->  00:01:52.639
instance in California, we've got lots of

86

00:01:52.639  -->  00:01:52.649

87

00:01:52.649  -->  00:01:56.389
cities and their sizes represent the

88

00:01:56.389  -->  00:01:56.399

89

00:01:56.399  -->  00:01:59.510
percent contribution towards the profit

90

00:01:59.510  -->  00:01:59.520

91

00:01:59.520  -->  00:02:01.670
of California for each one of those

92

00:02:01.670  -->  00:02:01.680

93

00:02:01.680  -->  00:02:03.709
cities. So there we go quite an

94

00:02:03.709  -->  00:02:03.719

95

00:02:03.719  -->  00:02:05.929
interesting challenge ahead of us and

96

00:02:05.929  -->  00:02:05.939

97

00:02:05.939  -->  00:02:07.100
we're going to be using a level of

98

00:02:07.100  -->  00:02:07.110

99

00:02:07.110  -->  00:02:09.859
detailed calculations to solve it and

100

00:02:09.859  -->  00:02:09.869

101

00:02:09.869  -->  00:02:11.809
now let's quickly have a look at the

102

00:02:11.809  -->  00:02:11.819

103

00:02:11.819  -->  00:02:13.880
data set so we know what we're dealing

104

00:02:13.880  -->  00:02:13.890

105

00:02:13.890  -->  00:02:17.239
with. So here it is Megan merchandise.xlsx

106

00:02:17.300  -->  00:02:20.959
and if you have a look here we've

107

00:02:20.959  -->  00:02:20.969

108

00:02:20.969  -->  00:02:23.599
got actually actually got two tabs, tab1

109

00:02:23.599  -->  00:02:23.609

110

00:02:23.609  -->  00:02:27.080
has order IDs and for each other ID

111

00:02:27.080  -->  00:02:27.090

112

00:02:27.090  -->  00:02:29.479
has some information so the date, the

113

00:02:29.479  -->  00:02:29.489

114

00:02:29.489  -->  00:02:33.500
customer, the country, region, state, city

115

00:02:33.500  -->  00:02:33.510

116

00:02:33.510  -->  00:02:35.809
and postal code, segment shift a shift

117

00:02:35.809  -->  00:02:35.819

118

00:02:35.819  -->  00:02:39.050
mode so basically order ID in this tab

119

00:02:39.050  -->  00:02:39.060

120

00:02:39.060  -->  00:02:42.110
is unique so it's just order ID and then

121

00:02:42.110  -->  00:02:42.120

122

00:02:42.120  -->  00:02:44.839
information about that order ID where is

123

00:02:44.839  -->  00:02:44.849

124

00:02:44.849  -->  00:02:47.720
in order breakdown order ID is no longer

125

00:02:47.720  -->  00:02:47.730

126

00:02:47.730  -->  00:02:50.629
unique here we can see that for every

127

00:02:50.629  -->  00:02:50.639

128

00:02:50.639  -->  00:02:53.000
order that we might have several items

129

00:02:53.000  -->  00:02:53.010

130

00:02:53.010  -->  00:02:55.309
so for instance for this first order

131

00:02:55.309  -->  00:02:55.319

132

00:02:55.319  -->  00:02:57.949
we've got two items that constitute

133

00:02:57.949  -->  00:02:57.959

134

00:02:57.959  -->  00:03:00.259
disorder than this order

135

00:03:00.259  -->  00:03:00.269

136

00:03:00.269  -->  00:03:02.209
looks like it's just one single item

137

00:03:02.209  -->  00:03:02.219

138

00:03:02.219  -->  00:03:06.110
then this order has three items in it. So

139

00:03:06.110  -->  00:03:06.120

140

00:03:06.120  -->  00:03:07.640
as you can see there's lots of different

141

00:03:07.640  -->  00:03:07.650

142

00:03:07.650  -->  00:03:10.939
levels of granularity at which you can

143

00:03:10.939  -->  00:03:10.949

144

00:03:10.949  -->  00:03:13.339
visually creative visualization so

145

00:03:13.339  -->  00:03:13.349

146

00:03:13.349  -->  00:03:17.270
you've got the order items, order ID then

147

00:03:17.270  -->  00:03:17.280

148

00:03:17.280  -->  00:03:19.309
you've got the city's, you've got the

149

00:03:19.309  -->  00:03:19.319

150

00:03:19.319  -->  00:03:22.280
state's, you've got the region, you've got

151

00:03:22.280  -->  00:03:22.290

152

00:03:22.290  -->  00:03:24.229
the country and so on. So it's going to

153

00:03:24.229  -->  00:03:24.239

154

00:03:24.239  -->  00:03:25.699
be quite interesting challenge. Can't

155

00:03:25.699  -->  00:03:25.709

156

00:03:25.709  -->  00:03:28.189
wait to get started on it. So make sure

157

00:03:28.189  -->  00:03:28.199

158

00:03:28.199  -->  00:03:30.649
you download the data set and have a

159

00:03:30.649  -->  00:03:30.659

160

00:03:30.659  -->  00:03:32.270
look at it so that you are prepared to

161

00:03:32.270  -->  00:03:32.280

162

00:03:32.280  -->  00:03:34.009
proceed with this section. Its going to be

163

00:03:34.009  -->  00:03:34.019

164

00:03:34.019  -->  00:03:36.800
quite a challenging section. I'll be up

165

00:03:36.800  -->  00:03:36.810

166

00:03:36.810  -->  00:03:38.360
front with you but at the same time will

167

00:03:38.360  -->  00:03:38.370

168

00:03:38.370  -->  00:03:40.909
learn a lot and we'll learn some very

169

00:03:40.909  -->  00:03:40.919

170

00:03:40.919  -->  00:03:43.490
powerful techniques in Tableau. Can't wait to

171

00:03:43.490  -->  00:03:43.500

172

00:03:43.500  -->  00:03:44.300
get started, I

173

00:03:44.300  -->  00:03:44.310

174

00:03:44.310  -->  00:03:45.170
look forward to seeing you in the next

175

00:03:45.170  -->  00:03:45.180

176

00:03:45.180  -->  00:03:52.519
tutorial and until then happy analyzing.
