00:00:05,500  -->  00:00:07,080
Welcome back to the advanced course on

2

00:00:07,080  -->  00:00:07,090

3

00:00:07,090  -->  00:00:09,000
Tableau. In the previous tutorial we

4

00:00:09,000  -->  00:00:09,010

5

00:00:09,010  -->  00:00:11,220
talked about table calculations and we

6

00:00:11,220  -->  00:00:11,230

7

00:00:11,230  -->  00:00:13,259
had a look at a few Table calculations

8

00:00:13,259  -->  00:00:13,269

9

00:00:13,269  -->  00:00:16,019
that might be handy we looked at the

10

00:00:16,019  -->  00:00:16,029

11

00:00:16,029  -->  00:00:18,300
quick Table Calculations. Today we're

12

00:00:18,300  -->  00:00:18,310

13

00:00:18,310  -->  00:00:19,980
going to proceed with our challenge and

14

00:00:19,980  -->  00:00:19,990

15

00:00:19,990  -->  00:00:21,420
before we do I wanted to say that they

16

00:00:21,420  -->  00:00:21,430

17

00:00:21,430  -->  00:00:23,430
are other quick table calculations that

18

00:00:23,430  -->  00:00:23,440

19

00:00:23,440  -->  00:00:25,560
are present here, percent difference,

20

00:00:25,560  -->  00:00:25,570

21

00:00:25,570  -->  00:00:28,080
percent of total, rank percentile, moving

22

00:00:28,080  -->  00:00:28,090

23

00:00:28,090  -->  00:00:30,269
average and so on. We will look at some

24

00:00:30,269  -->  00:00:30,279

25

00:00:30,279  -->  00:00:32,429
of them throughout this section but I do

26

00:00:32,429  -->  00:00:32,439

27

00:00:32,439  -->  00:00:34,439
encourage you to explore the rest of

28

00:00:34,439  -->  00:00:34,449

29

00:00:34,449  -->  00:00:37,020
them on your own and just see how they

30

00:00:37,020  -->  00:00:37,030

31

00:00:37,030  -->  00:00:37,530
work.

32

00:00:37,530  -->  00:00:37,540

33

00:00:37,540  -->  00:00:39,060
It will be very similar to what we did

34

00:00:39,060  -->  00:00:39,070

35

00:00:39,070  -->  00:00:41,729
with the running total and difference. It

36

00:00:41,729  -->  00:00:41,739

37

00:00:41,739  -->  00:00:43,620
will just give you a good overview of

38

00:00:43,620  -->  00:00:43,630

39

00:00:43,630  -->  00:00:45,569
what quick table calculations are there

40

00:00:45,569  -->  00:00:45,579

41

00:00:45,579  -->  00:00:47,850
at your disposal if you need them and

42

00:00:47,850  -->  00:00:47,860

43

00:00:47,860  -->  00:00:50,819
for now let's save this worksheet as

44

00:00:50,819  -->  00:00:50,829

45

00:00:50,829  -->  00:00:51,780
Tableau

46

00:00:51,780  -->  00:00:51,790

47

00:00:51,790  -->  00:00:56,819
Calyx testing and let's proceed on with

48

00:00:56,819  -->  00:00:56,829

49

00:00:56,829  -->  00:00:59,369
a new sheet. So, for the new sheet what we

50

00:00:59,369  -->  00:00:59,379

51

00:00:59,379  -->  00:01:01,229
want to do is we want to also take date

52

00:01:01,229  -->  00:01:01,239

53

00:01:01,239  -->  00:01:06,510
time and this time we want it to be a

54

00:01:06,510  -->  00:01:06,520

55

00:01:06,520  -->  00:01:08,910
day like this.

56

00:01:08,910  -->  00:01:08,920

57

00:01:08,920  -->  00:01:12,359
So, basically a proper timeline and we

58

00:01:12,359  -->  00:01:12,369

59

00:01:12,369  -->  00:01:14,910
want to visualize tons once again, but in

60

00:01:14,910  -->  00:01:14,920

61

00:01:14,920  -->  00:01:17,160
this case we want to break it down by

62

00:01:17,160  -->  00:01:17,170

63

00:01:17,170  -->  00:01:19,260
machine. So we'll use color to break it down

64

00:01:19,260  -->  00:01:19,270

65

00:01:19,270  -->  00:01:21,989
machine and also we'll drag machine into

66

00:01:21,989  -->  00:01:21,999

67

00:01:21,999  -->  00:01:24,929
the rows so every machine is in its

68

00:01:24,929  -->  00:01:24,939

69

00:01:24,939  -->  00:01:28,800
separate row.

70

00:01:28,800  -->  00:01:28,810

71

00:01:28,810  -->  00:01:32,069
Ok, so those are our machines actually

72

00:01:32,069  -->  00:01:32,079

73

00:01:32,079  -->  00:01:35,309
let's change this or not day but hour so

74

00:01:35,309  -->  00:01:35,319

75

00:01:35,319  -->  00:01:37,050
we actually see what's happening by hour.

76

00:01:37,050  -->  00:01:37,060

77

00:01:37,060  -->  00:01:39,809
So, those are hour machines that's the

78

00:01:39,809  -->  00:01:39,819

79

00:01:39,819  -->  00:01:42,330
actual tons. Let me format this so we can

80

00:01:42,330  -->  00:01:42,340

81

00:01:42,340  -->  00:01:44,159
see a little bit better and make this a

82

00:01:44,159  -->  00:01:44,169

83

00:01:44,169  -->  00:01:48,809
ten and what we have here is all of the

84

00:01:48,809  -->  00:01:48,819

85

00:01:48,819  -->  00:01:50,940
machines that we are working with. Now

86

00:01:50,940  -->  00:01:50,950

87

00:01:50,950  -->  00:01:53,969
let's do one thing so just follow me

88

00:01:53,969  -->  00:01:53,979

89

00:01:53,979  -->  00:01:55,499
when I do this and I'll explain why are

90

00:01:55,499  -->  00:01:55,509

91

00:01:55,509  -->  00:01:57,719
we doing it literally in a few

92

00:01:57,719  -->  00:01:57,729

93

00:01:57,729  -->  00:01:59,760
minutes. So, we're going to take the

94

00:01:59,760  -->  00:01:59,770

95

00:01:59,770  -->  00:02:01,349
capacity and we're going to match it to

96

00:02:01,349  -->  00:02:01,359

97

00:02:01,359  -->  00:02:02,549
the machine so here you can see the

98

00:02:02,549  -->  00:02:02,559

99

00:02:02,559  -->  00:02:05,309
actual tons and then the capacities come

100

00:02:05,309  -->  00:02:05,319

101

00:02:05,319  -->  00:02:05,999
later.

102

00:02:05,999  -->  00:02:06,009

103

00:02:06,009  -->  00:02:07,709
So now let's just drag the capacity for

104

00:02:07,709  -->  00:02:07,719

105

00:02:07,719  -->  00:02:09,540
the right the correct machine above that

106

00:02:09,540  -->  00:02:09,550

107

00:02:09,550  -->  00:02:10,949
machine so here we've got the nominal

108

00:02:10,949  -->  00:02:10,959

109

00:02:10,959  -->  00:02:12,670
capacity for RL1 and there we go to

110

00:02:12,670  -->  00:02:12,680

111

00:02:12,680  -->  00:02:15,039
actual tons for all RL1 and

112

00:02:15,039  -->  00:02:15,049

113

00:02:15,049  -->  00:02:16,330
let's do that the same thing for the

114

00:02:16,330  -->  00:02:16,340

115

00:02:16,340  -->  00:02:18,580
rest of them as well. So, that's RL2

116

00:02:18,580  -->  00:02:18,590

117

00:02:18,590  -->  00:02:20,259
it goes there.

118

00:02:20,259  -->  00:02:20,269

119

00:02:20,269  -->  00:02:23,649
That's reclaimer 2, that's stacker

120

00:02:23,649  -->  00:02:23,659

121

00:02:23,659  -->  00:02:26,649
reclaimer one, stacker reclaimer  four a and

122

00:02:26,649  -->  00:02:26,659

123

00:02:26,659  -->  00:02:29,349
stacker reclaimer six and so let's just

124

00:02:29,349  -->  00:02:29,359

125

00:02:29,359  -->  00:02:36,520
check rl1, rl2 sr1, sr4a, sr6. Alright,

126

00:02:36,520  -->  00:02:36,530

127

00:02:36,530  -->  00:02:39,729
perfect. So, that is exactly what we want

128

00:02:39,729  -->  00:02:39,739

129

00:02:39,739  -->  00:02:41,559
for now and as you can see the nominal

130

00:02:41,559  -->  00:02:41,569

131

00:02:41,569  -->  00:02:44,589
capacity is constant throughout the

132

00:02:44,589  -->  00:02:44,599

133

00:02:44,599  -->  00:02:46,210
timeline and that is because it is a

134

00:02:46,210  -->  00:02:46,220

135

00:02:46,220  -->  00:02:48,039
nominal capacity doesn't change but the

136

00:02:48,039  -->  00:02:48,049

137

00:02:48,049  -->  00:02:51,369
actual tons that the machine processed is

138

00:02:51,369  -->  00:02:51,379

139

00:02:51,379  -->  00:02:53,319
changing and it's varying somewhere

140

00:02:53,319  -->  00:02:53,329

141

00:02:53,329  -->  00:02:56,500
around that nominal capacity. Now what we

142

00:02:56,500  -->  00:02:56,510

143

00:02:56,510  -->  00:02:58,869
want to do next is to start off with for

144

00:02:58,869  -->  00:02:58,879

145

00:02:58,879  -->  00:03:00,369
us to better understand what's going on

146

00:03:00,369  -->  00:03:00,379

147

00:03:00,379  -->  00:03:02,589
which is going to leave these two. So, we

148

00:03:02,589  -->  00:03:02,599

149

00:03:02,599  -->  00:03:04,929
only going to leave rl1, we're going to

150

00:03:04,929  -->  00:03:04,939

151

00:03:04,939  -->  00:03:06,309
leave the nominal capacity and actual

152

00:03:06,309  -->  00:03:06,319

153

00:03:06,319  -->  00:03:08,440
tons using a filter and then we will

154

00:03:08,440  -->  00:03:08,450

155

00:03:08,450  -->  00:03:11,679
return everything after we have a plan

156

00:03:11,679  -->  00:03:11,689

157

00:03:11,689  -->  00:03:12,520
of attack.

158

00:03:12,520  -->  00:03:12,530

159

00:03:12,530  -->  00:03:14,890
So let's take machine again and put into

160

00:03:14,890  -->  00:03:14,900

161

00:03:14,900  -->  00:03:17,649
filters and now select none and then

162

00:03:17,649  -->  00:03:17,659

163

00:03:17,659  -->  00:03:20,830
just select rl1 and rl1 here and click

164

00:03:20,830  -->  00:03:20,840

165

00:03:20,840  -->  00:03:23,170
okay and what you will see here is now we're

166

00:03:23,170  -->  00:03:23,180

167

00:03:23,180  -->  00:03:28,179
only left with our machine rl1. Now, what

168

00:03:28,179  -->  00:03:28,189

169

00:03:28,189  -->  00:03:29,050
can we do here?

170

00:03:29,050  -->  00:03:29,060

171

00:03:29,060  -->  00:03:31,750
How can table calculations help us solve

172

00:03:31,750  -->  00:03:31,760

173

00:03:31,760  -->  00:03:32,710
the problem?

174

00:03:32,710  -->  00:03:32,720

175

00:03:32,720  -->  00:03:36,369
How can they help us find that idle

176

00:03:36,369  -->  00:03:36,379

177

00:03:36,379  -->  00:03:41,050
capacity and check that threshold for

178

00:03:41,050  -->  00:03:41,060

179

00:03:41,060  -->  00:03:44,140
the a day average and the 10-percent and

180

00:03:44,140  -->  00:03:44,150

181

00:03:44,150  -->  00:03:44,860
so on.

182

00:03:44,860  -->  00:03:44,870

183

00:03:44,870  -->  00:03:49,059
So what we have here is a Table. Let's,

184

00:03:49,059  -->  00:03:49,069

185

00:03:49,069  -->  00:03:50,949
let me show you a quick trick so a handy

186

00:03:50,949  -->  00:03:50,959

187

00:03:50,959  -->  00:03:53,110
tip might produce yellow star over here.

188

00:03:53,110  -->  00:03:53,120

189

00:03:53,120  -->  00:03:57,369
What you can do with this visual to see

190

00:03:57,369  -->  00:03:57,379

191

00:03:57,379  -->  00:03:59,379
it as numbers. Sometimes, sometimes

192

00:03:59,379  -->  00:03:59,389

193

00:03:59,389  -->  00:04:02,080
it might be handy to see the numbers. Even

194

00:04:02,080  -->  00:04:02,090

195

00:04:02,090  -->  00:04:03,399
though most of the time we're trying to go

196

00:04:03,399  -->  00:04:03,409

197

00:04:03,409  -->  00:04:05,289
the opposite way turn numbers into

198

00:04:05,289  -->  00:04:05,299

199

00:04:05,299  -->  00:04:06,699
pictures sometimes you might want to

200

00:04:06,699  -->  00:04:06,709

201

00:04:06,709  -->  00:04:08,499
turn pictures into numbers. So all you

202

00:04:08,499  -->  00:04:08,509

203

00:04:08,509  -->  00:04:10,360
have to do to achieve that is right

204

00:04:10,360  -->  00:04:10,370

205

00:04:10,370  -->  00:04:13,300
click on your sheet and select set of

206

00:04:13,300  -->  00:04:13,310

207

00:04:13,310  -->  00:04:15,039
duplicate sheets. Select duplicate as

208

00:04:15,039  -->  00:04:15,049

209

00:04:15,049  -->  00:04:17,740
crosstab and that will bring up the

210

00:04:17,740  -->  00:04:17,750

211

00:04:17,750  -->  00:04:20,229
numbers or turn the pictures into

212

00:04:20,229  -->  00:04:20,239

213

00:04:20,239  -->  00:04:22,899
numbers so like magic or reverse

214

00:04:22,899  -->  00:04:22,909

215

00:04:22,909  -->  00:04:24,780
magic probably in this case

216

00:04:24,780  -->  00:04:24,790

217

00:04:24,790  -->  00:04:29,670
and let's, let me format this one so that

218

00:04:29,670  -->  00:04:29,680

219

00:04:29,680  -->  00:04:32,010
this was a bit bigger because it might be

220

00:04:32,010  -->  00:04:32,020

221

00:04:32,020  -->  00:04:33,840
more important for us to see what's

222

00:04:33,840  -->  00:04:33,850

223

00:04:33,850  -->  00:04:35,580
going on here.

224

00:04:35,580  -->  00:04:35,590

225

00:04:35,590  -->  00:04:37,500
Okay, so here we've got the nominal capacity

226

00:04:37,500  -->  00:04:37,510

227

00:04:37,510  -->  00:04:38,850
and actual tons

228

00:04:38,850  -->  00:04:38,860

229

00:04:38,860  -->  00:04:40,800
just as in this sheet nominal capacity

230

00:04:40,800  -->  00:04:40,810

231

00:04:40,810  -->  00:04:42,120
actual ton.

232

00:04:42,120  -->  00:04:42,130

233

00:04:42,130  -->  00:04:43,710
Their only difference is here it's a picture,

234

00:04:43,710  -->  00:04:43,720

235

00:04:43,720  -->  00:04:46,320
here it's a very long long table for every

236

00:04:46,320  -->  00:04:46,330

237

00:04:46,330  -->  00:04:48,600
single hour in the month of September

238

00:04:48,600  -->  00:04:48,610

239

00:04:48,610  -->  00:04:51,660
2015. What we want to do is we want to

240

00:04:51,660  -->  00:04:51,670

241

00:04:51,670  -->  00:04:54,480
perform a table calculation on our

242

00:04:54,480  -->  00:04:54,490

243

00:04:54,490  -->  00:04:56,970
actual tons. The table calculation that

244

00:04:56,970  -->  00:04:56,980

245

00:04:56,980  -->  00:04:58,830
we've talked about so far they are

246

00:04:58,830  -->  00:04:58,840

247

00:04:58,840  -->  00:05:01,650
always working across your table so from

248

00:05:01,650  -->  00:05:01,660

249

00:05:01,660  -->  00:05:03,750
left to right and let's run one of

250

00:05:03,750  -->  00:05:03,760

251

00:05:03,760  -->  00:05:07,080
those just to see how we go so if

252

00:05:07,080  -->  00:05:07,090

253

00:05:07,090  -->  00:05:12,210
we take, click here in the drop-down we

254

00:05:12,210  -->  00:05:12,220

255

00:05:12,220  -->  00:05:15,240
click add quick table calculation and we

256

00:05:15,240  -->  00:05:15,250

257

00:05:15,250  -->  00:05:17,610
select for instance running total right?

258

00:05:17,610  -->  00:05:17,620

259

00:05:17,620  -->  00:05:19,140
So, you can see that's how the running

260

00:05:19,140  -->  00:05:19,150

261

00:05:19,150  -->  00:05:21,210
total looks like and if I now switch to

262

00:05:21,210  -->  00:05:21,220

263

00:05:21,220  -->  00:05:22,350
the numbers, what it's doing is just

264

00:05:22,350  -->  00:05:22,360

265

00:05:22,360  -->  00:05:24,900
adding these numbers so here's 4200, here

266

00:05:24,900  -->  00:05:24,910

267

00:05:24,910  -->  00:05:27,480
it's in the second day it's this plus this,

268

00:05:27,480  -->  00:05:27,490

269

00:05:27,490  -->  00:05:29,220
in the third day it's the total so far

270

00:05:29,220  -->  00:05:29,230

271

00:05:29,230  -->  00:05:31,770
plus that and it's the total so far that and so

272

00:05:31,770  -->  00:05:31,780

273

00:05:31,780  -->  00:05:35,160
on and the same thing for the top so nominal

274

00:05:35,160  -->  00:05:35,170

275

00:05:35,170  -->  00:05:37,260
capacity. But, we don't want that to be

276

00:05:37,260  -->  00:05:37,270

277

00:05:37,270  -->  00:05:39,000
honest we need something else.

278

00:05:39,000  -->  00:05:39,010

279

00:05:39,010  -->  00:05:41,550
So, let's look at different color table

280

00:05:41,550  -->  00:05:41,560

281

00:05:41,560  -->  00:05:42,360
calculation.

282

00:05:42,360  -->  00:05:42,370

283

00:05:42,370  -->  00:05:44,880
How about we look at difference right? So,

284

00:05:44,880  -->  00:05:44,890

285

00:05:44,890  -->  00:05:46,410
we've already worked with difference and we

286

00:05:46,410  -->  00:05:46,420

287

00:05:46,420  -->  00:05:48,090
remember that this is showing us the

288

00:05:48,090  -->  00:05:48,100

289

00:05:48,100  -->  00:05:51,120
difference for every single bar compared

290

00:05:51,120  -->  00:05:51,130

291

00:05:51,130  -->  00:05:52,800
to the previous bar or for every single

292

00:05:52,800  -->  00:05:52,810

293

00:05:52,810  -->  00:05:54,810
hour compared to the previous hour. So

294

00:05:54,810  -->  00:05:54,820

295

00:05:54,820  -->  00:05:57,900
let's take a random hour from here so

296

00:05:57,900  -->  00:05:57,910

297

00:05:57,910  -->  00:06:00,420
let's look here. What is it doing? It's

298

00:06:00,420  -->  00:06:00,430

299

00:06:00,430  -->  00:06:03,870
taking this value minus this value.

300

00:06:03,870  -->  00:06:03,880

301

00:06:03,880  -->  00:06:05,070
What is the answer and then it's

302

00:06:05,070  -->  00:06:05,080

303

00:06:05,080  -->  00:06:06,810
plotting it. What is then the for the

304

00:06:06,810  -->  00:06:06,820

305

00:06:06,820  -->  00:06:08,430
next bar? For this bar for September

306

00:06:08,430  -->  00:06:08,440

307

00:06:08,440  -->  00:06:11,070
1st, for 2am it's checking. What is the

308

00:06:11,070  -->  00:06:11,080

309

00:06:11,080  -->  00:06:12,630
difference between this and this and

310

00:06:12,630  -->  00:06:12,640

311

00:06:12,640  -->  00:06:14,670
it's plotting it. So we can simply check it

312

00:06:14,670  -->  00:06:14,680

313

00:06:14,680  -->  00:06:17,550
by looking at September first at 3am the

314

00:06:17,550  -->  00:06:17,560

315

00:06:17,560  -->  00:06:19,770
difference over here we can see it's 250

316

00:06:19,770  -->  00:06:19,780

317

00:06:19,780  -->  00:06:22,320
so for September first 2 or 3 am, it

318

00:06:22,320  -->  00:06:22,330

319

00:06:22,330  -->  00:06:24,180
should be 250. Let's go ahead and check

320

00:06:24,180  -->  00:06:24,190

321

00:06:24,190  -->  00:06:27,840
that. So September first 3 am as you can

322

00:06:27,840  -->  00:06:27,850

323

00:06:27,850  -->  00:06:30,630
see here in the pop up it is 250. So,

324

00:06:30,630  -->  00:06:30,640

325

00:06:30,640  -->  00:06:33,090
that's good but that's good but that's

326

00:06:33,090  -->  00:06:33,100

327

00:06:33,100  -->  00:06:35,760
not helping us. What we actually want is

328

00:06:35,760  -->  00:06:35,770

329

00:06:35,770  -->  00:06:37,890
we want the difference I'm just going to

330

00:06:37,890  -->  00:06:37,900

331

00:06:37,900  -->  00:06:39,900
take this calculator quick table

332

00:06:39,900  -->  00:06:39,910

333

00:06:39,910  -->  00:06:42,210
calculation off. So, clear table calculation

334

00:06:42,210  -->  00:06:42,220

335

00:06:42,220  -->  00:06:45,000
and what we really want is we want the

336

00:06:45,000  -->  00:06:45,010

337

00:06:45,010  -->  00:06:47,700
idle capacity and to get to the idle

338

00:06:47,700  -->  00:06:47,710

339

00:06:47,710  -->  00:06:49,830
capacity the first thing, the first step

340

00:06:49,830  -->  00:06:49,840

341

00:06:49,840  -->  00:06:51,120
would be to find out the difference

342

00:06:51,120  -->  00:06:51,130

343

00:06:51,130  -->  00:06:55,080
between our actual tons and the nominal

344

00:06:55,080  -->  00:06:55,090

345

00:06:55,090  -->  00:06:57,900
capacity so how different is the actual

346

00:06:57,900  -->  00:06:57,910

347

00:06:57,910  -->  00:07:00,720
tons to what it should be and we have a

348

00:07:00,720  -->  00:07:00,730

349

00:07:00,730  -->  00:07:02,370
nominal capacity here and where we have the

350

00:07:02,370  -->  00:07:02,380

351

00:07:02,380  -->  00:07:04,050
actual tons here all we have to do is

352

00:07:04,050  -->  00:07:04,060

353

00:07:04,060  -->  00:07:06,510
somehow find a way to subtract what we

354

00:07:06,510  -->  00:07:06,520

355

00:07:06,520  -->  00:07:09,210
have here from what we have here right?

356

00:07:09,210  -->  00:07:09,220

357

00:07:09,220  -->  00:07:11,400
So far all our table calculations are

358

00:07:11,400  -->  00:07:11,410

359

00:07:11,410  -->  00:07:12,720
going from left to right.

360

00:07:12,720  -->  00:07:12,730

361

00:07:12,730  -->  00:07:14,340
How do we do a table calculation and

362

00:07:14,340  -->  00:07:14,350

363

00:07:14,350  -->  00:07:17,070
goes out from bottom to

364

00:07:17,070  -->  00:07:17,080

365

00:07:17,080  -->  00:07:19,290
top? Because if we look at the table,

366

00:07:19,290  -->  00:07:19,300

367

00:07:19,300  -->  00:07:22,290
these values are in fact in one table.

368

00:07:22,290  -->  00:07:22,300

369

00:07:22,300  -->  00:07:24,420
All we have to do is subtract, instead of

370

00:07:24,420  -->  00:07:24,430

371

00:07:24,430  -->  00:07:27,630
subtracting this from this or

372

00:07:27,630  -->  00:07:27,640

373

00:07:27,640  -->  00:07:28,890
looking for the difference between these

374

00:07:28,890  -->  00:07:28,900

375

00:07:28,900  -->  00:07:30,360
two we have to look for the difference

376

00:07:30,360  -->  00:07:30,370

377

00:07:30,370  -->  00:07:31,980
between these two and then for these

378

00:07:31,980  -->  00:07:31,990

379

00:07:31,990  -->  00:07:34,320
ones these chance on. So we just have to

380

00:07:34,320  -->  00:07:34,330

381

00:07:34,330  -->  00:07:37,230
change the orientation of the way the

382

00:07:37,230  -->  00:07:37,240

383

00:07:37,240  -->  00:07:39,030
table calculation works. And in order to

384

00:07:39,030  -->  00:07:39,040

385

00:07:39,040  -->  00:07:41,190
achieve that, Tableau has a very very

386

00:07:41,190  -->  00:07:41,200

387

00:07:41,200  -->  00:07:44,250
easy functionality. All you have to do is,

388

00:07:44,250  -->  00:07:44,260

389

00:07:44,260  -->  00:07:47,340
so quick table calculation right so same

390

00:07:47,340  -->  00:07:47,350

391

00:07:47,350  -->  00:07:49,860
thing difference right now is doing not

392

00:07:49,860  -->  00:07:49,870

393

00:07:49,870  -->  00:07:52,560
what we want but instead we were going

394

00:07:52,560  -->  00:07:52,570

395

00:07:52,570  -->  00:07:54,930
we're going to say compute using table

396

00:07:54,930  -->  00:07:54,940

397

00:07:54,940  -->  00:07:58,470
down. Right? So right away this disappears

398

00:07:58,470  -->  00:07:58,480

399

00:07:58,480  -->  00:08:00,810
because as you remember the first it has

400

00:08:00,810  -->  00:08:00,820

401

00:08:00,820  -->  00:08:02,220
nothing to compare there's nothing above

402

00:08:02,220  -->  00:08:02,230

403

00:08:02,230  -->  00:08:06,300
it but this whole row is now being

404

00:08:06,300  -->  00:08:06,310

405

00:08:06,310  -->  00:08:08,730
compared to the values above it and

406

00:08:08,730  -->  00:08:08,740

407

00:08:08,740  -->  00:08:11,700
let's have a look in our example just to

408

00:08:11,700  -->  00:08:11,710

409

00:08:11,710  -->  00:08:13,110
make sure that this is what is happening.

410

00:08:13,110  -->  00:08:13,120

411

00:08:13,120  -->  00:08:17,159
So let's have a look at for instance we

412

00:08:17,159  -->  00:08:17,169

413

00:08:17,169  -->  00:08:19,740
could look at here September first at

414

00:08:19,740  -->  00:08:19,750

415

00:08:19,750  -->  00:08:22,110
3am so remember what it used to be 250

416

00:08:22,110  -->  00:08:22,120

417

00:08:22,120  -->  00:08:23,969
because the difference here is 250 but

418

00:08:23,969  -->  00:08:23,979

419

00:08:23,979  -->  00:08:25,409
now the difference should be 0 because

420

00:08:25,409  -->  00:08:25,419

421

00:08:25,419  -->  00:08:28,110
it is actually working at its capacity

422

00:08:28,110  -->  00:08:28,120

423

00:08:28,120  -->  00:08:31,830
the Machine process 4200 tons which is

424

00:08:31,830  -->  00:08:31,840

425

00:08:31,840  -->  00:08:34,620
its maximum so let's check that again. So

426

00:08:34,620  -->  00:08:34,630

427

00:08:34,630  -->  00:08:39,300
September first 3am September first 4am,

428

00:08:39,300  -->  00:08:39,310

429

00:08:39,310  -->  00:08:44,280
3am, so there you can see. Where was that?

430

00:08:44,280  -->  00:08:44,290

431

00:08:44,290  -->  00:08:46,829
there we go September first 3am you can

432

00:08:46,829  -->  00:08:46,839

433

00:08:46,839  -->  00:08:48,680
see that the capacity or the

434

00:08:48,680  -->  00:08:48,690

435

00:08:48,690  -->  00:08:51,560
difference in tons between the actual

436

00:08:51,560  -->  00:08:51,570

437

00:08:51,570  -->  00:08:54,590
tons and the nominal capacity is zero

438

00:08:54,590  -->  00:08:54,600

439

00:08:54,600  -->  00:08:56,420
you can see that in the pop-up. So that

440

00:08:56,420  -->  00:08:56,430

441

00:08:56,430  -->  00:08:58,220
is exactly so here you can see that the

442

00:08:58,220  -->  00:08:58,230

443

00:08:58,230  -->  00:09:00,350
difference is zero. So that is exactly,

444

00:09:00,350  -->  00:09:00,360

445

00:09:00,360  -->  00:09:03,080
what we want as you can see the table

446

00:09:03,080  -->  00:09:03,090

447

00:09:03,090  -->  00:09:04,970
calculations been run from top to bottom.

448

00:09:04,970  -->  00:09:04,980

449

00:09:04,980  -->  00:09:07,310
So let's explore that a little bit

450

00:09:07,310  -->  00:09:07,320

451

00:09:07,320  -->  00:09:10,070
further, if we now go into the drop-down

452

00:09:10,070  -->  00:09:10,080

453

00:09:10,080  -->  00:09:12,890
and not just use these quick controls

454

00:09:12,890  -->  00:09:12,900

455

00:09:12,900  -->  00:09:15,170
but go into the edit table calculation

456

00:09:15,170  -->  00:09:15,180

457

00:09:15,180  -->  00:09:17,780
window. What you will see here is that

458

00:09:17,780  -->  00:09:17,790

459

00:09:17,790  -->  00:09:19,490
you have the same controls but they're

460

00:09:19,490  -->  00:09:19,500

461

00:09:19,500  -->  00:09:23,720
all nice see together and here what it's

462

00:09:23,720  -->  00:09:23,730

463

00:09:23,730  -->  00:09:26,180
telling us is we used to have a cross

464

00:09:26,180  -->  00:09:26,190

465

00:09:26,190  -->  00:09:28,100
difficult apply. Once again you see that

466

00:09:28,100  -->  00:09:28,110

467

00:09:28,110  -->  00:09:30,470
old visual where it's calculating like

468

00:09:30,470  -->  00:09:30,480

469

00:09:30,480  -->  00:09:33,170
that but now it's calculating down. So

470

00:09:33,170  -->  00:09:33,180

471

00:09:33,180  -->  00:09:35,390
it's taking the difference from the

472

00:09:35,390  -->  00:09:35,400

473

00:09:35,400  -->  00:09:37,490
previous. Some not from the next, not from the

474

00:09:37,490  -->  00:09:37,500

475

00:09:37,500  -->  00:09:38,720
first, not from the last, but from the

476

00:09:38,720  -->  00:09:38,730

477

00:09:38,730  -->  00:09:40,490
previous and in this case because we

478

00:09:40,490  -->  00:09:40,500

479

00:09:40,500  -->  00:09:42,500
arranged it remember this is this is the

480

00:09:42,500  -->  00:09:42,510

481

00:09:42,510  -->  00:09:44,690
answer to why we arranged it that way. We

482

00:09:44,690  -->  00:09:44,700

483

00:09:44,700  -->  00:09:46,460
specifically put the nominal capacity

484

00:09:46,460  -->  00:09:46,470

485

00:09:46,470  -->  00:09:49,340
above the actual capacity so that when

486

00:09:49,340  -->  00:09:49,350

487

00:09:49,350  -->  00:09:51,710
we do this table calculation the nominal

488

00:09:51,710  -->  00:09:51,720

489

00:09:51,720  -->  00:09:53,720
capacity is the one that's being

490

00:09:53,720  -->  00:09:53,730

491

00:09:53,730  -->  00:09:55,940
subtracted for the correct machine of

492

00:09:55,940  -->  00:09:55,950

493

00:09:55,950  -->  00:09:58,640
course. So, that is what we're doing table

494

00:09:58,640  -->  00:09:58,650

495

00:09:58,650  -->  00:10:02,990
down. Now let's go ahead and will close

496

00:10:02,990  -->  00:10:03,000

497

00:10:03,000  -->  00:10:04,430
this for now but we'll return to it in a

498

00:10:04,430  -->  00:10:04,440

499

00:10:04,440  -->  00:10:06,710
second now we're ready to return

500

00:10:06,710  -->  00:10:06,720

501

00:10:06,720  -->  00:10:09,920
everything we had right so let's get rid

502

00:10:09,920  -->  00:10:09,930

503

00:10:09,930  -->  00:10:11,420
of this filter and i'm just going to

504

00:10:11,420  -->  00:10:11,430

505

00:10:11,430  -->  00:10:13,760
drag it out of here and what you will

506

00:10:13,760  -->  00:10:13,770

507

00:10:13,770  -->  00:10:17,660
see now is all of the values are back

508

00:10:17,660  -->  00:10:17,670

509

00:10:17,670  -->  00:10:19,760
now this might look a bit confusing so

510

00:10:19,760  -->  00:10:19,770

511

00:10:19,770  -->  00:10:23,570
to start off with let's take this

512

00:10:23,570  -->  00:10:23,580

513

00:10:23,580  -->  00:10:26,210
table calculation and clear table

514

00:10:26,210  -->  00:10:26,220

515

00:10:26,220  -->  00:10:28,460
calculation. So once again what we have

516

00:10:28,460  -->  00:10:28,470

517

00:10:28,470  -->  00:10:30,230
is nominal capacity for the machine

518

00:10:30,230  -->  00:10:30,240

519

00:10:30,240  -->  00:10:32,210
actual tons, normal capacity for the

520

00:10:32,210  -->  00:10:32,220

521

00:10:32,220  -->  00:10:34,460
second machine actual tons and so on.

522

00:10:34,460  -->  00:10:34,470

523

00:10:34,470  -->  00:10:37,730
Now what we want to do is return a table

524

00:10:37,730  -->  00:10:37,740

525

00:10:37,740  -->  00:10:40,130
calculation so quick table calculation

526

00:10:40,130  -->  00:10:40,140

527

00:10:40,140  -->  00:10:44,000
difference and we want you can view

528

00:10:44,000  -->  00:10:44,010

529

00:10:44,010  -->  00:10:46,700
choosing table down. So, now what it's doing

530

00:10:46,700  -->  00:10:46,710

531

00:10:46,710  -->  00:10:48,860
is it's taking same thing as we have,

532

00:10:48,860  -->  00:10:48,870

533

00:10:48,870  -->  00:10:49,790
we want.

534

00:10:49,790  -->  00:10:49,800

535

00:10:49,800  -->  00:10:52,730
It's taking the actual tons and

536

00:10:52,730  -->  00:10:52,740

537

00:10:52,740  -->  00:10:54,590
subtracting the nominal capacity that

538

00:10:54,590  -->  00:10:54,600

539

00:10:54,600  -->  00:10:57,140
was above then for this one same actual

540

00:10:57,140  -->  00:10:57,150

541

00:10:57,150  -->  00:10:58,720
tons minus nominal capacity,

542

00:10:58,720  -->  00:10:58,730

543

00:10:58,730  -->  00:11:01,120
actual ton minus normal capacity that

544

00:11:01,120  -->  00:11:01,130

545

00:11:01,130  -->  00:11:03,460
reason why the nominal capacity looks weird

546

00:11:03,460  -->  00:11:03,470

547

00:11:03,470  -->  00:11:04,990
right now. Well first one here

548

00:11:04,990  -->  00:11:05,000

549

00:11:05,000  -->  00:11:06,850
obviously because there's nothing above

550

00:11:06,850  -->  00:11:06,860

551

00:11:06,860  -->  00:11:08,889
it but then for the nominal capacity the

552

00:11:08,889  -->  00:11:08,899

553

00:11:08,899  -->  00:11:10,750
same thing, same calculation is being

554

00:11:10,750  -->  00:11:10,760

555

00:11:10,760  -->  00:11:14,019
performed. The nominal capacity, the value you

556

00:11:14,019  -->  00:11:14,029

557

00:11:14,029  -->  00:11:16,509
see here the picture the visualization

558

00:11:16,509  -->  00:11:16,519

559

00:11:16,519  -->  00:11:18,250
is representing the difference between

560

00:11:18,250  -->  00:11:18,260

561

00:11:18,260  -->  00:11:20,620
nominal capacity for machine to minus

562

00:11:20,620  -->  00:11:20,630

563

00:11:20,630  -->  00:11:22,480
actual tons machine one. Which

564

00:11:22,480  -->  00:11:22,490

565

00:11:22,490  -->  00:11:24,280
doesn't make any sense right? So, there's

566

00:11:24,280  -->  00:11:24,290

567

00:11:24,290  -->  00:11:26,889
no point in subtracting the nominal and

568

00:11:26,889  -->  00:11:26,899

569

00:11:26,899  -->  00:11:29,199
actual for two different machines and

570

00:11:29,199  -->  00:11:29,209

571

00:11:29,209  -->  00:11:31,060
that is a side effect of these table

572

00:11:31,060  -->  00:11:31,070

573

00:11:31,070  -->  00:11:33,850
calculations because sometimes in your

574

00:11:33,850  -->  00:11:33,860

575

00:11:33,860  -->  00:11:36,730
table you might not need this result and

576

00:11:36,730  -->  00:11:36,740

577

00:11:36,740  -->  00:11:38,439
that's not a problem for us because we

578

00:11:38,439  -->  00:11:38,449

579

00:11:38,449  -->  00:11:40,810
don't need to look at these nominal

580

00:11:40,810  -->  00:11:40,820

581

00:11:40,820  -->  00:11:42,759
capacities anymore with use them in our

582

00:11:42,759  -->  00:11:42,769

583

00:11:42,769  -->  00:11:45,400
table calculation and now we can get rid

584

00:11:45,400  -->  00:11:45,410

585

00:11:45,410  -->  00:11:47,050
of them and all you have to do is select

586

00:11:47,050  -->  00:11:47,060

587

00:11:47,060  -->  00:11:49,720
the nominal capacities all of the rows

588

00:11:49,720  -->  00:11:49,730

589

00:11:49,730  -->  00:11:52,870
with nominal capacity using control so

590

00:11:52,870  -->  00:11:52,880

591

00:11:52,880  -->  00:11:54,490
holding down control your keyboard and

592

00:11:54,490  -->  00:11:54,500

593

00:11:54,500  -->  00:11:56,860
if you right-click and don't click

594

00:11:56,860  -->  00:11:56,870

595

00:11:56,870  -->  00:11:58,389
exclude because that way you will

596

00:11:58,389  -->  00:11:58,399

597

00:11:58,399  -->  00:12:00,220
exclude them from the whole calculation

598

00:12:00,220  -->  00:12:00,230

599

00:12:00,230  -->  00:12:02,710
and you'll exclude them from the table  and that

600

00:12:02,710  -->  00:12:02,720

601

00:12:02,720  -->  00:12:05,980
will mess up this table calculation,

602

00:12:05,980  -->  00:12:05,990

603

00:12:05,990  -->  00:12:08,110
which is being run downwards through

604

00:12:08,110  -->  00:12:08,120

605

00:12:08,120  -->  00:12:10,990
your table. What you want to do is hide,

606

00:12:10,990  -->  00:12:11,000

607

00:12:11,000  -->  00:12:12,879
so you want to simply hide them. There's

608

00:12:12,879  -->  00:12:12,889

609

00:12:12,889  -->  00:12:14,559
they're still participating in your

610

00:12:14,559  -->  00:12:14,569

611

00:12:14,569  -->  00:12:16,540
table calculation the only thing is that

612

00:12:16,540  -->  00:12:16,550

613

00:12:16,550  -->  00:12:20,050
they are no longer visible.

614

00:12:20,050  -->  00:12:20,060

615

00:12:20,060  -->  00:12:22,269
That's all, and what we have in front of

616

00:12:22,269  -->  00:12:22,279

617

00:12:22,279  -->  00:12:25,389
us now is the difference that we were

618

00:12:25,389  -->  00:12:25,399

619

00:12:25,399  -->  00:12:28,509
after. So this is the idle capacity is

620

00:12:28,509  -->  00:12:28,519

621

00:12:28,519  -->  00:12:30,250
not really expresses in a percentage not

622

00:12:30,250  -->  00:12:30,260

623

00:12:30,260  -->  00:12:33,970
yet, but it is expressed is a idle

624

00:12:33,970  -->  00:12:33,980

625

00:12:33,980  -->  00:12:36,730
capacity in tons. So you can see, how much

626

00:12:36,730  -->  00:12:36,740

627

00:12:36,740  -->  00:12:39,309
idle capacity in every single hour each

628

00:12:39,309  -->  00:12:39,319

629

00:12:39,319  -->  00:12:41,259
single one of the machines had. So that

630

00:12:41,259  -->  00:12:41,269

631

00:12:41,269  -->  00:12:42,699
is a great start, that is our very first

632

00:12:42,699  -->  00:12:42,709

633

00:12:42,709  -->  00:12:44,949
step towards our goal and in the next

634

00:12:44,949  -->  00:12:44,959

635

00:12:44,959  -->  00:12:47,559
tutorial we will continue on from here. I

636

00:12:47,559  -->  00:12:47,569

637

00:12:47,569  -->  00:12:48,639
look forward to seeing you next time

638

00:12:48,639  -->  00:12:48,649

639

00:12:48,649  -->  00:12:50,639
until then, Happy analyzing.

640

00:12:50,639  -->  00:12:50,649

641

00:12:50,649  -->  00:12:58,619
