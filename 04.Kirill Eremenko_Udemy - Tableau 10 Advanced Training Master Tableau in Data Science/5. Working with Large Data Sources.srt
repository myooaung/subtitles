00:00:03,180  -->  00:00:07,370
Hello and welcome back to the advanced course

2

00:00:07,370  -->  00:00:07,380

3

00:00:07,380  -->  00:00:09,380
on Tableau. This is where we stopped off

4

00:00:09,380  -->  00:00:09,390

5

00:00:09,390  -->  00:00:12,440
last time. We created the box plots and

6

00:00:12,440  -->  00:00:12,450

7

00:00:12,450  -->  00:00:14,840
we finalized our analysis of the

8

00:00:14,840  -->  00:00:14,850

9

00:00:14,850  -->  00:00:17,540
competitor research. Today we're going to

10

00:00:17,540  -->  00:00:17,550

11

00:00:17,550  -->  00:00:19,640
move on to the next stage of our

12

00:00:19,640  -->  00:00:19,650

13

00:00:19,650  -->  00:00:23,029
analysis and we will look at the data

14

00:00:23,029  -->  00:00:23,039

15

00:00:23,039  -->  00:00:26,029
set for the different industries in the

16

00:00:26,029  -->  00:00:26,039

17

00:00:26,039  -->  00:00:28,730
different states of Australia. So let's

18

00:00:28,730  -->  00:00:28,740

19

00:00:28,740  -->  00:00:31,910
go ahead and get started, so first of all

20

00:00:31,910  -->  00:00:31,920

21

00:00:31,920  -->  00:00:34,580
I'm going to bring up the folder with

22

00:00:34,580  -->  00:00:34,590

23

00:00:34,590  -->  00:00:37,670
our data sets which is here section 4 and

24

00:00:37,670  -->  00:00:37,680

25

00:00:37,680  -->  00:00:39,889
let's go ahead and open up that data set.

26

00:00:39,889  -->  00:00:39,899

27

00:00:39,899  -->  00:00:42,350
So as you can see this is an official

28

00:00:42,350  -->  00:00:42,360

29

00:00:42,360  -->  00:00:44,840
data set taken from the Australian

30

00:00:44,840  -->  00:00:44,850

31

00:00:44,850  -->  00:00:46,549
Bureau of Statistics, I'll just assume in

32

00:00:46,549  -->  00:00:46,559

33

00:00:46,559  -->  00:00:51,080
a bit and in the first tab you can see

34

00:00:51,080  -->  00:00:51,090

35

00:00:51,090  -->  00:00:54,020
an index,  so what is telling you is what

36

00:00:54,020  -->  00:00:54,030

37

00:00:54,030  -->  00:00:56,690
the data set actually contains and

38

00:00:56,690  -->  00:00:56,700

39

00:00:56,700  -->  00:00:58,100
you can click any of these links and

40

00:00:58,100  -->  00:00:58,110

41

00:00:58,110  -->  00:01:00,979
I'll take you to the correct column in

42

00:01:00,979  -->  00:01:00,989

43

00:01:00,989  -->  00:01:04,429
the data set tab, so I'll just scroll to

44

00:01:04,429  -->  00:01:04,439

45

00:01:04,439  -->  00:01:05,479
the bottom you can see this quite a

46

00:01:05,479  -->  00:01:05,489

47

00:01:05,489  -->  00:01:08,840
lot. Here is the actual data set tab, so

48

00:01:08,840  -->  00:01:08,850

49

00:01:08,850  -->  00:01:12,980
if you look here you can see the label

50

00:01:12,980  -->  00:01:12,990

51

00:01:12,990  -->  00:01:15,289
then you got some more information,

52

00:01:15,289  -->  00:01:15,299

53

00:01:15,299  -->  00:01:17,719
got an ID and then you've got to the

54

00:01:17,719  -->  00:01:17,729

55

00:01:17,729  -->  00:01:20,660
dates on the left here, so these are new

56

00:01:20,660  -->  00:01:20,670

57

00:01:20,670  -->  00:01:22,969
separate months and here you've got the

58

00:01:22,969  -->  00:01:22,979

59

00:01:22,979  -->  00:01:24,830
turnover, so for instance here we've got

60

00:01:24,830  -->  00:01:24,840

61

00:01:24,840  -->  00:01:28,789
the turnover for the for New South Wales

62

00:01:28,789  -->  00:01:28,799

63

00:01:28,799  -->  00:01:31,399
for the industry which is called other

64

00:01:31,399  -->  00:01:31,409

65

00:01:31,409  -->  00:01:34,310
specialized food retailing, so there's

66

00:01:34,310  -->  00:01:34,320

67

00:01:34,320  -->  00:01:38,149
62.7 million dollars turnover in that

68

00:01:38,149  -->  00:01:38,159

69

00:01:38,159  -->  00:01:41,030
industry in June 1982 and

70

00:01:41,030  -->  00:01:41,040

71

00:01:41,040  -->  00:01:43,609
the dates range from 1982 all the way to

72

00:01:43,609  -->  00:01:43,619

73

00:01:43,619  -->  00:01:45,289
2015.

74

00:01:45,289  -->  00:01:45,299

75

00:01:45,299  -->  00:01:47,990
Ok so as you can see it's quite a large

76

00:01:47,990  -->  00:01:48,000

77

00:01:48,000  -->  00:01:49,490
data set. There isn't that mean you

78

00:01:49,490  -->  00:01:49,500

79

00:01:49,500  -->  00:01:51,440
rows right so if I go to the bottom so

80

00:01:51,440  -->  00:01:51,450

81

00:01:51,450  -->  00:01:54,710
let me zoom out, if I go to the bottom

82

00:01:54,710  -->  00:01:54,720

83

00:01:54,720  -->  00:01:58,160
here is only 411 rows in total but if we

84

00:01:58,160  -->  00:01:58,170

85

00:01:58,170  -->  00:02:01,999
scroll, if we scroll to the right so if

86

00:02:01,999  -->  00:02:02,009

87

00:02:02,009  -->  00:02:03,020
I'm just going to scroll to the right

88

00:02:03,020  -->  00:02:03,030

89

00:02:03,030  -->  00:02:04,850
you can see that there is a lot of

90

00:02:04,850  -->  00:02:04,860

91

00:02:04,860  -->  00:02:07,580
columns right, because is it a lot of

92

00:02:07,580  -->  00:02:07,590

93

00:02:07,590  -->  00:02:11,299
industries multiplied by quite a few states and that

94

00:02:11,299  -->  00:02:11,309

95

00:02:11,309  -->  00:02:13,670
gives us a lot of columns and therefore

96

00:02:13,670  -->  00:02:13,680

97

00:02:13,680  -->  00:02:15,979
it is quite a large data set because we

98

00:02:15,979  -->  00:02:15,989

99

00:02:15,989  -->  00:02:16,610
will have to

100

00:02:16,610  -->  00:02:16,620

101

00:02:16,620  -->  00:02:18,410
learn how to work with these columns we

102

00:02:18,410  -->  00:02:18,420

103

00:02:18,420  -->  00:02:20,930
will have to pivot them and prepare them

104

00:02:20,930  -->  00:02:20,940

105

00:02:20,940  -->  00:02:21,979
for analysis.

106

00:02:21,979  -->  00:02:21,989

107

00:02:21,989  -->  00:02:25,009
Finally the last tab is inquiries so it

108

00:02:25,009  -->  00:02:25,019

109

00:02:25,019  -->  00:02:27,229
just has information how you can get in

110

00:02:27,229  -->  00:02:27,239

111

00:02:27,239  -->  00:02:29,899
touch with the ABS to ask them some

112

00:02:29,899  -->  00:02:29,909

113

00:02:29,909  -->  00:02:31,729
questions, so let me show you how the

114

00:02:31,729  -->  00:02:31,739

115

00:02:31,739  -->  00:02:35,210
index works just for fun I can click any

116

00:02:35,210  -->  00:02:35,220

117

00:02:35,220  -->  00:02:37,100
link here and we'll highlight that

118

00:02:37,100  -->  00:02:37,110

119

00:02:37,110  -->  00:02:39,649
column that I need to that I was after

120

00:02:39,649  -->  00:02:39,659

121

00:02:39,659  -->  00:02:41,509
so if I want to find let's say

122

00:02:41,509  -->  00:02:41,519

123

00:02:41,519  -->  00:02:44,420
Queensland and I want to look at

124

00:02:44,420  -->  00:02:44,430

125

00:02:44,430  -->  00:02:46,550
newspaper and book retailing I click

126

00:02:46,550  -->  00:02:46,560

127

00:02:46,560  -->  00:02:49,460
that link and I go there. What we're not

128

00:02:49,460  -->  00:02:49,470

129

00:02:49,470  -->  00:02:50,660
actually going to use that in our

130

00:02:50,660  -->  00:02:50,670

131

00:02:50,670  -->  00:02:52,220
analysis I thought it was just pretty

132

00:02:52,220  -->  00:02:52,230

133

00:02:52,230  -->  00:02:54,259
cool thing to look at. Anyway so that's

134

00:02:54,259  -->  00:02:54,269

135

00:02:54,269  -->  00:02:56,809
our data set and what we want to do is

136

00:02:56,809  -->  00:02:56,819

137

00:02:56,819  -->  00:02:58,670
we want to prepare it before we actually

138

00:02:58,670  -->  00:02:58,680

139

00:02:58,680  -->  00:03:02,539
connect to it in Tableau and first thing

140

00:03:02,539  -->  00:03:02,549

141

00:03:02,549  -->  00:03:05,809
that jumps into mind or into attention

142

00:03:05,809  -->  00:03:05,819

143

00:03:05,819  -->  00:03:08,630
is that if you look at these rows over

144

00:03:08,630  -->  00:03:08,640

145

00:03:08,640  -->  00:03:11,420
here so just look at these rows as

146

00:03:11,420  -->  00:03:11,430

147

00:03:11,430  -->  00:03:13,729
I scroll to the right. You can see that

148

00:03:13,729  -->  00:03:13,739

149

00:03:13,739  -->  00:03:15,199
they're not changing right? Everything

150

00:03:15,199  -->  00:03:15,209

151

00:03:15,209  -->  00:03:17,180
else changing these rows are not

152

00:03:17,180  -->  00:03:17,190

153

00:03:17,190  -->  00:03:19,729
changing and that is because it's just

154

00:03:19,729  -->  00:03:19,739

155

00:03:19,739  -->  00:03:22,039
information that is common for the whole

156

00:03:22,039  -->  00:03:22,049

157

00:03:22,049  -->  00:03:24,500
spreadsheet or for this whole data set

158

00:03:24,500  -->  00:03:24,510

159

00:03:24,510  -->  00:03:27,620
so it's all measured in millions serious

160

00:03:27,620  -->  00:03:27,630

161

00:03:27,630  -->  00:03:29,330
type data types, so some additional

162

00:03:29,330  -->  00:03:29,340

163

00:03:29,340  -->  00:03:30,740
information, so where it starts, where it

164

00:03:30,740  -->  00:03:30,750

165

00:03:30,750  -->  00:03:34,069
ends, number of observations. We don't

166

00:03:34,069  -->  00:03:34,079

167

00:03:34,079  -->  00:03:35,509
actually need this information because

168

00:03:35,509  -->  00:03:35,519

169

00:03:35,519  -->  00:03:37,520
it's common for the whole data set we

170

00:03:37,520  -->  00:03:37,530

171

00:03:37,530  -->  00:03:40,159
can get rid of it and if we do need

172

00:03:40,159  -->  00:03:40,169

173

00:03:40,169  -->  00:03:41,990
anything like say millions we can just

174

00:03:41,990  -->  00:03:42,000

175

00:03:42,000  -->  00:03:44,750
remember that or somehow add to our

176

00:03:44,750  -->  00:03:44,760

177

00:03:44,760  -->  00:03:47,300
analysis we don't need it in every

178

00:03:47,300  -->  00:03:47,310

179

00:03:47,310  -->  00:03:49,039
single column. So let's go ahead and

180

00:03:49,039  -->  00:03:49,049

181

00:03:49,049  -->  00:03:51,830
select all of these rows by click clicking

182

00:03:51,830  -->  00:03:51,840

183

00:03:51,840  -->  00:03:54,800
shift-space and then press control minus to

184

00:03:54,800  -->  00:03:54,810

185

00:03:54,810  -->  00:03:56,180
get rid of them.

186

00:03:56,180  -->  00:03:56,190

187

00:03:56,190  -->  00:03:59,720
Ok now series ID, as you can see here,

188

00:03:59,720  -->  00:03:59,730

189

00:03:59,730  -->  00:04:03,650
what it is is a unique identifier of

190

00:04:03,650  -->  00:04:03,660

191

00:04:03,660  -->  00:04:09,349
each category and we actually don't

192

00:04:09,349  -->  00:04:09,359

193

00:04:09,359  -->  00:04:11,000
really needed either because we don't

194

00:04:11,000  -->  00:04:11,010

195

00:04:11,010  -->  00:04:12,770
know how to understand these years idea

196

00:04:12,770  -->  00:04:12,780

197

00:04:12,780  -->  00:04:16,099
these are kind of internal IDs for the

198

00:04:16,099  -->  00:04:16,109

199

00:04:16,109  -->  00:04:17,839
stranger of Statistics what we are after

200

00:04:17,839  -->  00:04:17,849

201

00:04:17,849  -->  00:04:20,060
is the text description which gives us

202

00:04:20,060  -->  00:04:20,070

203

00:04:20,070  -->  00:04:21,890
way more information and is way more

204

00:04:21,890  -->  00:04:21,900

205

00:04:21,900  -->  00:04:24,439
useful for us so there's a one-to-one

206

00:04:24,439  -->  00:04:24,449

207

00:04:24,449  -->  00:04:26,870
match here between series ID and this

208

00:04:26,870  -->  00:04:26,880

209

00:04:26,880  -->  00:04:29,990
text label so we don't need to keep this

210

00:04:29,990  -->  00:04:30,000

211

00:04:30,000  -->  00:04:31,250
series ID, we're not going to benefit

212

00:04:31,250  -->  00:04:31,260

213

00:04:31,260  -->  00:04:33,620
from it in any kind of way. So let's go

214

00:04:33,620  -->  00:04:33,630

215

00:04:33,630  -->  00:04:35,480
ahead and get rid of it as well. So

216

00:04:35,480  -->  00:04:35,490

217

00:04:35,490  -->  00:04:38,210
select that press control minus and there we go,

218

00:04:38,210  -->  00:04:38,220

219

00:04:38,220  -->  00:04:41,180
it's gone. Now before we save this

220

00:04:41,180  -->  00:04:41,190

221

00:04:41,190  -->  00:04:44,450
worksheet I wanted to give you a tip,

222

00:04:44,450  -->  00:04:44,460

223

00:04:44,460  -->  00:04:46,970
what I normally do is if I change

224

00:04:46,970  -->  00:04:46,980

225

00:04:46,980  -->  00:04:50,990
anything in my data source then I like

226

00:04:50,990  -->  00:04:51,000

227

00:04:51,000  -->  00:04:53,240
to have a copy of the original, so I

228

00:04:53,240  -->  00:04:53,250

229

00:04:53,250  -->  00:04:56,240
haven't saved it yet so let's copy this

230

00:04:56,240  -->  00:04:56,250

231

00:04:56,250  -->  00:04:58,730
file. There's a copy and that goes into

232

00:04:58,730  -->  00:04:58,740

233

00:04:58,740  -->  00:05:01,130
the archive folder here so if we have

234

00:05:01,130  -->  00:05:01,140

235

00:05:01,140  -->  00:05:02,750
any questions in the future we can

236

00:05:02,750  -->  00:05:02,760

237

00:05:02,760  -->  00:05:04,010
always revert back to the original.

238

00:05:04,010  -->  00:05:04,020

239

00:05:04,020  -->  00:05:07,100
Alright that's done, now we can save this

240

00:05:07,100  -->  00:05:07,110

241

00:05:07,110  -->  00:05:09,890
file and we can go ahead and connect it

242

00:05:09,890  -->  00:05:09,900

243

00:05:09,900  -->  00:05:12,350
in Tableau, but before we do I wanted to

244

00:05:12,350  -->  00:05:12,360

245

00:05:12,360  -->  00:05:14,240
outline what we're going to do today. So

246

00:05:14,240  -->  00:05:14,250

247

00:05:14,250  -->  00:05:16,880
today, I'm going to show you two things.

248

00:05:16,880  -->  00:05:16,890

249

00:05:16,890  -->  00:05:19,880
In this tutorial we will learn how to

250

00:05:19,880  -->  00:05:19,890

251

00:05:19,890  -->  00:05:22,640
first of all fix up our data set because

252

00:05:22,640  -->  00:05:22,650

253

00:05:22,650  -->  00:05:24,710
here you will see that if I scroll to

254

00:05:24,710  -->  00:05:24,720

255

00:05:24,720  -->  00:05:27,050
right some columns they don't have

256

00:05:27,050  -->  00:05:27,060

257

00:05:27,060  -->  00:05:29,480
values in them, So if I go down to the

258

00:05:29,480  -->  00:05:29,490

259

00:05:29,490  -->  00:05:31,700
bottom like this column does have values

260

00:05:31,700  -->  00:05:31,710

261

00:05:31,710  -->  00:05:33,560
eventually in it. Now let's go find

262

00:05:33,560  -->  00:05:33,570

263

00:05:33,570  -->  00:05:35,840
another one that doesn't, so here

264

00:05:35,840  -->  00:05:35,850

265

00:05:35,850  -->  00:05:38,659
turnover for liquor in Tasmania. You

266

00:05:38,659  -->  00:05:38,669

267

00:05:38,669  -->  00:05:40,580
can see that if i scroll to the top, if I

268

00:05:40,580  -->  00:05:40,590

269

00:05:40,590  -->  00:05:42,860
scroll to all still also has values to

270

00:05:42,860  -->  00:05:42,870

271

00:05:42,870  -->  00:05:43,790
find another one.

272

00:05:43,790  -->  00:05:43,800

273

00:05:43,800  -->  00:05:47,180
There you go, so turnover for department

274

00:05:47,180  -->  00:05:47,190

275

00:05:47,190  -->  00:05:49,159
stores  in Tasmania so you can

276

00:05:49,159  -->  00:05:49,169

277

00:05:49,169  -->  00:05:50,659
see that this column was completely empty

278

00:05:50,659  -->  00:05:50,669

279

00:05:50,669  -->  00:05:53,330
and that is going to cause issues for

280

00:05:53,330  -->  00:05:53,340

281

00:05:53,340  -->  00:05:55,730
our pivot and you'll see why, and I'll

282

00:05:55,730  -->  00:05:55,740

283

00:05:55,740  -->  00:05:57,860
show you how to deal with that in a

284

00:05:57,860  -->  00:05:57,870

285

00:05:57,870  -->  00:06:00,020
Tableau and the second thing, I will show

286

00:06:00,020  -->  00:06:00,030

287

00:06:00,030  -->  00:06:03,440
you how to perform today is how to deal

288

00:06:03,440  -->  00:06:03,450

289

00:06:03,450  -->  00:06:05,659
with large data sets. Now this isn't a

290

00:06:05,659  -->  00:06:05,669

291

00:06:05,669  -->  00:06:08,420
huge data set per say because it only has

292

00:06:08,420  -->  00:06:08,430

293

00:06:08,430  -->  00:06:11,150
401 rows but at the same time it has a

294

00:06:11,150  -->  00:06:11,160

295

00:06:11,160  -->  00:06:13,400
lot of columns so it might be slowing

296

00:06:13,400  -->  00:06:13,410

297

00:06:13,410  -->  00:06:15,320
down the work of Tableau depending on

298

00:06:15,320  -->  00:06:15,330

299

00:06:15,330  -->  00:06:18,230
your machine and I will show you how or

300

00:06:18,230  -->  00:06:18,240

301

00:06:18,240  -->  00:06:20,690
a quick trick that you can apply to

302

00:06:20,690  -->  00:06:20,700

303

00:06:20,700  -->  00:06:23,719
large data sets that will help you do your

304

00:06:23,719  -->  00:06:23,729

305

00:06:23,729  -->  00:06:26,780
analysis without having to wait a long

306

00:06:26,780  -->  00:06:26,790

307

00:06:26,790  -->  00:06:29,300
times for Tableau to load. 
So that's what

308

00:06:29,300  -->  00:06:29,310

309

00:06:29,310  -->  00:06:30,469
we're going to do today and in the next

310

00:06:30,469  -->  00:06:30,479

311

00:06:30,479  -->  00:06:32,659
tutorial we're going to perform the

312

00:06:32,659  -->  00:06:32,669

313

00:06:32,669  -->  00:06:35,030
pivots and splits and so on. So let's go

314

00:06:35,030  -->  00:06:35,040

315

00:06:35,040  -->  00:06:37,380
ahead and save that

316

00:06:37,380  -->  00:06:37,390

317

00:06:37,390  -->  00:06:40,470
and once that saved we can close it and

318

00:06:40,470  -->  00:06:40,480

319

00:06:40,480  -->  00:06:42,270
we can go to Tableau. This is where we

320

00:06:42,270  -->  00:06:42,280

321

00:06:42,280  -->  00:06:45,780
left off last time, so let's go ahead and

322

00:06:45,780  -->  00:06:45,790

323

00:06:45,790  -->  00:06:48,300
add another data source, plus excel

324

00:06:48,300  -->  00:06:48,310

325

00:06:48,310  -->  00:06:50,760
file there's our data set

326

00:06:50,760  -->  00:06:50,770

327

00:06:50,770  -->  00:06:54,210
let's open that up as you can see here

328

00:06:54,210  -->  00:06:54,220

329

00:06:54,220  -->  00:06:56,100
you've got the named ranges so those are

330

00:06:56,100  -->  00:06:56,110

331

00:06:56,110  -->  00:06:58,200
the ones that allow those links to work

332

00:06:58,200  -->  00:06:58,210

333

00:06:58,210  -->  00:07:00,150
that we saw we don't need them we're not

334

00:07:00,150  -->  00:07:00,160

335

00:07:00,160  -->  00:07:01,140
going to use them as our data

336

00:07:01,140  -->  00:07:01,150

337

00:07:01,150  -->  00:07:02,760
sources. We're going to use data one

338

00:07:02,760  -->  00:07:02,770

339

00:07:02,770  -->  00:07:04,830
as our data source, so let's drag

340

00:07:04,830  -->  00:07:04,840

341

00:07:04,840  -->  00:07:07,530
that in here, as you can see it's already

342

00:07:07,530  -->  00:07:07,540

343

00:07:07,540  -->  00:07:10,920
taking a bit of time to load,

344

00:07:10,920  -->  00:07:10,930

345

00:07:10,930  -->  00:07:14,460
Ok so there is our data set. Now if

346

00:07:14,460  -->  00:07:14,470

347

00:07:14,470  -->  00:07:16,470
you scroll to the right here, you will

348

00:07:16,470  -->  00:07:16,480

349

00:07:16,480  -->  00:07:20,400
find that all these columns are numeric

350

00:07:20,400  -->  00:07:20,410

351

00:07:20,410  -->  00:07:27,420
except sometimes, you will see that

352

00:07:27,420  -->  00:07:27,430

353

00:07:27,430  -->  00:07:31,500
columns are recognized as ABC values. So

354

00:07:31,500  -->  00:07:31,510

355

00:07:31,510  -->  00:07:33,390
here you've got one, you've got another

356

00:07:33,390  -->  00:07:33,400

357

00:07:33,400  -->  00:07:34,980
one, another one and that's exactly what

358

00:07:34,980  -->  00:07:34,990

359

00:07:34,990  -->  00:07:36,120
I was talking about, so if I scroll down

360

00:07:36,120  -->  00:07:36,130

361

00:07:36,130  -->  00:07:37,770
to the bottom here you'll see that this

362

00:07:37,770  -->  00:07:37,780

363

00:07:37,780  -->  00:07:39,660
column is completely empty so Tableau

364

00:07:39,660  -->  00:07:39,670

365

00:07:39,670  -->  00:07:42,060
has no idea that numeric? Is that a text

366

00:07:42,060  -->  00:07:42,070

367

00:07:42,070  -->  00:07:44,430
column?  What is it? And it recognizes it

368

00:07:44,430  -->  00:07:44,440

369

00:07:44,440  -->  00:07:46,770
as a text column by default and what

370

00:07:46,770  -->  00:07:46,780

371

00:07:46,780  -->  00:07:48,540
will happen if we when we did our pivot

372

00:07:48,540  -->  00:07:48,550

373

00:07:48,550  -->  00:07:50,250
if we select all the columns and we

374

00:07:50,250  -->  00:07:50,260

375

00:07:50,260  -->  00:07:51,960
don't pivot Tableau will see they're

376

00:07:51,960  -->  00:07:51,970

377

00:07:51,970  -->  00:07:54,480
trying to combine numeric column and text

378

00:07:54,480  -->  00:07:54,490

379

00:07:54,490  -->  00:07:57,090
columns and will default to text in the

380

00:07:57,090  -->  00:07:57,100

381

00:07:57,100  -->  00:07:59,070
pivot and we don't want that. So there

382

00:07:59,070  -->  00:07:59,080

383

00:07:59,080  -->  00:08:00,480
are two ways of fixing it, you can go

384

00:08:00,480  -->  00:08:00,490

385

00:08:00,490  -->  00:08:01,980
back to the data set and replace his

386

00:08:01,980  -->  00:08:01,990

387

00:08:01,990  -->  00:08:05,100
nulls with zeros or on the other hand

388

00:08:05,100  -->  00:08:05,110

389

00:08:05,110  -->  00:08:06,600
because we know that we won't need these

390

00:08:06,600  -->  00:08:06,610

391

00:08:06,610  -->  00:08:08,580
columns and of course we also want to

392

00:08:08,580  -->  00:08:08,590

393

00:08:08,590  -->  00:08:10,560
learn some additional methods that we

394

00:08:10,560  -->  00:08:10,570

395

00:08:10,570  -->  00:08:12,240
can apply in Tableau. We're going to deal

396

00:08:12,240  -->  00:08:12,250

397

00:08:12,250  -->  00:08:15,300
with it here in Tableau. So the way to go

398

00:08:15,300  -->  00:08:15,310

399

00:08:15,310  -->  00:08:17,100
about it is to simply hide these columns,

400

00:08:17,100  -->  00:08:17,110

401

00:08:17,110  -->  00:08:19,650
so click the drop-down, select hide and

402

00:08:19,650  -->  00:08:19,660

403

00:08:19,660  -->  00:08:22,260
that column is gone. It's not going to be

404

00:08:22,260  -->  00:08:22,270

405

00:08:22,270  -->  00:08:24,600
participating in the analysis and the

406

00:08:24,600  -->  00:08:24,610

407

00:08:24,610  -->  00:08:26,100
faster way to do it is if you go to the

408

00:08:26,100  -->  00:08:26,110

409

00:08:26,110  -->  00:08:28,080
meta data and you scroll down and you

410

00:08:28,080  -->  00:08:28,090

411

00:08:28,090  -->  00:08:29,940
look for these columns here so that you

412

00:08:29,940  -->  00:08:29,950

413

00:08:29,950  -->  00:08:31,710
can see two of them just go ahead and

414

00:08:31,710  -->  00:08:31,720

415

00:08:31,720  -->  00:08:32,790
hide them.

416

00:08:32,790  -->  00:08:32,800

417

00:08:32,800  -->  00:08:34,770
Let's find some more, there's another one

418

00:08:34,770  -->  00:08:34,780

419

00:08:34,780  -->  00:08:38,610
right click and hide.

420

00:08:38,610  -->  00:08:38,620

421

00:08:38,620  -->  00:08:41,640
That's there's a few more so that's what

422

00:08:41,640  -->  00:08:41,650

423

00:08:41,650  -->  00:08:45,180
is that seven in total just have a look

424

00:08:45,180  -->  00:08:45,190

425

00:08:45,190  -->  00:08:47,310
through them, so now just have a look

426

00:08:47,310  -->  00:08:47,320

427

00:08:47,320  -->  00:08:48,780
through them is another one. That makes

428

00:08:48,780  -->  00:08:48,790

429

00:08:48,790  -->  00:08:50,269
it eight,

430

00:08:50,269  -->  00:08:50,279

431

00:08:50,279  -->  00:08:52,759
and make sure you've got all of the ABC

432

00:08:52,759  -->  00:08:52,769

433

00:08:52,769  -->  00:08:55,970
columns and there we go. We've prepared

434

00:08:55,970  -->  00:08:55,980

435

00:08:55,980  -->  00:08:58,249
for the pivot so now the pivot should

436

00:08:58,249  -->  00:08:58,259

437

00:08:58,259  -->  00:09:00,949
run fine but at the same time as we

438

00:09:00,949  -->  00:09:00,959

439

00:09:00,959  -->  00:09:02,449
discussed this data set is quite

440

00:09:02,449  -->  00:09:02,459

441

00:09:02,459  -->  00:09:04,999
large and depending on your machine when

442

00:09:04,999  -->  00:09:05,009

443

00:09:05,009  -->  00:09:07,249
you pivot this these columns it might

444

00:09:07,249  -->  00:09:07,259

445

00:09:07,259  -->  00:09:09,230
take a while and even if you have a fast

446

00:09:09,230  -->  00:09:09,240

447

00:09:09,240  -->  00:09:11,150
machine this is still a great chance

448

00:09:11,150  -->  00:09:11,160

449

00:09:11,160  -->  00:09:13,220
great opportunity to practice how to

450

00:09:13,220  -->  00:09:13,230

451

00:09:13,230  -->  00:09:15,110
deal with large data sets so when the

452

00:09:15,110  -->  00:09:15,120

453

00:09:15,120  -->  00:09:16,249
time comes when you're working for

454

00:09:16,249  -->  00:09:16,259

455

00:09:16,259  -->  00:09:19,579
million road data set you will know what

456

00:09:19,579  -->  00:09:19,589

457

00:09:19,589  -->  00:09:24,110
sneaky trick you can apply to help your

458

00:09:24,110  -->  00:09:24,120

459

00:09:24,120  -->  00:09:27,290
analysis. So and the sneaky trick is not

460

00:09:27,290  -->  00:09:27,300

461

00:09:27,300  -->  00:09:29,749
that complex it's actually applying a

462

00:09:29,749  -->  00:09:29,759

463

00:09:29,759  -->  00:09:34,069
data source filter. A data source filter is

464

00:09:34,069  -->  00:09:34,079

465

00:09:34,079  -->  00:09:36,019
applied by clicking this bottom-up over

466

00:09:36,019  -->  00:09:36,029

467

00:09:36,029  -->  00:09:38,030
here. So you click add and you'll be able

468

00:09:38,030  -->  00:09:38,040

469

00:09:38,040  -->  00:09:40,160
to add a filter that will remove rows

470

00:09:40,160  -->  00:09:40,170

471

00:09:40,170  -->  00:09:42,079
from your analysis and the difference

472

00:09:42,079  -->  00:09:42,089

473

00:09:42,089  -->  00:09:43,670
between a datasource filter and a normal

474

00:09:43,670  -->  00:09:43,680

475

00:09:43,680  -->  00:09:45,410
filter in Tableau is that the data source

476

00:09:45,410  -->  00:09:45,420

477

00:09:45,420  -->  00:09:48,019
filter is applied at the connection

478

00:09:48,019  -->  00:09:48,029

479

00:09:48,029  -->  00:09:49,999
level of to the data set and that means

480

00:09:49,999  -->  00:09:50,009

481

00:09:50,009  -->  00:09:51,739
that the data won't even be

482

00:09:51,739  -->  00:09:51,749

483

00:09:51,749  -->  00:09:55,699
imported in to Tableau and it's all of

484

00:09:55,699  -->  00:09:55,709

485

00:09:55,709  -->  00:09:57,769
your analysis from here onwards won't

486

00:09:57,769  -->  00:09:57,779

487

00:09:57,779  -->  00:09:59,780
even be able to access that data in any

488

00:09:59,780  -->  00:09:59,790

489

00:09:59,790  -->  00:10:01,819
sort of way so on one hand you're

490

00:10:01,819  -->  00:10:01,829

491

00:10:01,829  -->  00:10:03,110
limiting yourself to the amount of

492

00:10:03,110  -->  00:10:03,120

493

00:10:03,120  -->  00:10:04,790
data that you have to work with but on the

494

00:10:04,790  -->  00:10:04,800

495

00:10:04,800  -->  00:10:07,340
other hand you're really giving Tableau

496

00:10:07,340  -->  00:10:07,350

497

00:10:07,350  -->  00:10:10,670
opportunity to speed up so it will be

498

00:10:10,670  -->  00:10:10,680

499

00:10:10,680  -->  00:10:12,319
working faster because we working with

500

00:10:12,319  -->  00:10:12,329

501

00:10:12,329  -->  00:10:15,439
less data.  Now data source filters are this

502

00:10:15,439  -->  00:10:15,449

503

00:10:15,449  -->  00:10:17,150
is not the main use case for data source

504

00:10:17,150  -->  00:10:17,160

505

00:10:17,160  -->  00:10:19,249
filters but at the same time it is a

506

00:10:19,249  -->  00:10:19,259

507

00:10:19,259  -->  00:10:23,600
very handy trick that you can use when

508

00:10:23,600  -->  00:10:23,610

509

00:10:23,610  -->  00:10:25,879
your encounter when you've encountered a

510

00:10:25,879  -->  00:10:25,889

511

00:10:25,889  -->  00:10:28,490
large data set that is really slowing

512

00:10:28,490  -->  00:10:28,500

513

00:10:28,500  -->  00:10:30,199
down Tableau and what you'll be doing is

514

00:10:30,199  -->  00:10:30,209

515

00:10:30,209  -->  00:10:32,240
basically you filter out most of the

516

00:10:32,240  -->  00:10:32,250

517

00:10:32,250  -->  00:10:33,470
row. So I'll show you how to do that,

518

00:10:33,470  -->  00:10:33,480

519

00:10:33,480  -->  00:10:35,480
let's click add, let's click select this

520

00:10:35,480  -->  00:10:35,490

521

00:10:35,490  -->  00:10:38,720
f1 column over here which is the date

522

00:10:38,720  -->  00:10:38,730

523

00:10:38,730  -->  00:10:41,869
and here we'll just say range of dates,

524

00:10:41,869  -->  00:10:41,879

525

00:10:41,879  -->  00:10:45,319
next and we're going to say we only want

526

00:10:45,319  -->  00:10:45,329

527

00:10:45,329  -->  00:10:48,049
dates starting from 2010 so

528

00:10:48,049  -->  00:10:48,059

529

00:10:48,059  -->  00:10:49,730
forget about all these dates. We'll work

530

00:10:49,730  -->  00:10:49,740

531

00:10:49,740  -->  00:10:52,040
with these dates for now and then what

532

00:10:52,040  -->  00:10:52,050

533

00:10:52,050  -->  00:10:53,360
we'll do is after we've done the

534

00:10:53,360  -->  00:10:53,370

535

00:10:53,370  -->  00:10:55,220
connection we've done the pivot, after

536

00:10:55,220  -->  00:10:55,230

537

00:10:55,230  -->  00:10:58,579
we've created our visualizations, after

538

00:10:58,579  -->  00:10:58,589

539

00:10:58,589  -->  00:11:01,040
we've commence our analysis so we're

540

00:11:01,040  -->  00:11:01,050

541

00:11:01,050  -->  00:11:03,810
ready to actually draw inside,

542

00:11:03,810  -->  00:11:03,820

543

00:11:03,820  -->  00:11:07,110
then we will remove this filter and so

544

00:11:07,110  -->  00:11:07,120

545

00:11:07,120  -->  00:11:08,550
that will allow us to do all the

546

00:11:08,550  -->  00:11:08,560

547

00:11:08,560  -->  00:11:11,160
pre-work with this filter on which will

548

00:11:11,160  -->  00:11:11,170

549

00:11:11,170  -->  00:11:13,680
make things fast and Tableau will be

550

00:11:13,680  -->  00:11:13,690

551

00:11:13,690  -->  00:11:15,960
flying but then when we're ready we'll

552

00:11:15,960  -->  00:11:15,970

553

00:11:15,970  -->  00:11:17,970
remove the filter and all of the data

554

00:11:17,970  -->  00:11:17,980

555

00:11:17,980  -->  00:11:19,620
will be loaded and all pros and we'll go

556

00:11:19,620  -->  00:11:19,630

557

00:11:19,630  -->  00:11:22,080
through all the same visualization that

558

00:11:22,080  -->  00:11:22,090

559

00:11:22,090  -->  00:11:25,950
we've created. So that is how personally

560

00:11:25,950  -->  00:11:25,960

561

00:11:25,960  -->  00:11:28,530
I would go about dealing with a large

562

00:11:28,530  -->  00:11:28,540

563

00:11:28,540  -->  00:11:30,960
data set, so let's go ahead and click OK

564

00:11:30,960  -->  00:11:30,970

565

00:11:30,970  -->  00:11:33,420
and click OK again and you'll see how

566

00:11:33,420  -->  00:11:33,430

567

00:11:33,430  -->  00:11:36,030
this data set has now been filtered and

568

00:11:36,030  -->  00:11:36,040

569

00:11:36,040  -->  00:11:38,340
we have rows only starting from

570

00:11:38,340  -->  00:11:38,350

571

00:11:38,350  -->  00:11:42,960
2010 so we have very few more rows

572

00:11:42,960  -->  00:11:43,460
compare to what we had and there we go

573

00:11:45,960  -->  00:11:45,970

574

00:11:45,970  -->  00:11:49,080
so that is how you remove columns that

575

00:11:49,080  -->  00:11:49,090

576

00:11:49,090  -->  00:11:50,700
you don't want to participate in now so

577

00:11:50,700  -->  00:11:50,710

578

00:11:50,710  -->  00:11:52,230
basically hide columns, by the way you

579

00:11:52,230  -->  00:11:52,240

580

00:11:52,240  -->  00:11:54,900
can see them here if you want to see

581

00:11:54,900  -->  00:11:54,910

582

00:11:54,910  -->  00:11:56,790
them you can click show hidden field and

583

00:11:56,790  -->  00:11:56,800

584

00:11:56,800  -->  00:11:59,310
it'll show you those fields where are

585

00:11:59,310  -->  00:11:59,320

586

00:11:59,320  -->  00:12:00,870
they so they are they're just a bit

587

00:12:00,870  -->  00:12:00,880

588

00:12:00,880  -->  00:12:02,700
greyed-out, but we don't want to see them

589

00:12:02,700  -->  00:12:02,710

590

00:12:02,710  -->  00:12:04,170
because we don't want to accidentally

591

00:12:04,170  -->  00:12:04,180

592

00:12:04,180  -->  00:12:05,700
include them in our analysis so let's

593

00:12:05,700  -->  00:12:05,710

594

00:12:05,710  -->  00:12:08,280
get rid of them again. So that's number

595

00:12:08,280  -->  00:12:08,290

596

00:12:08,290  -->  00:12:10,260
one, how to get rid of row columns that

597

00:12:10,260  -->  00:12:10,270

598

00:12:10,270  -->  00:12:13,170
you don't want and number two is that is

599

00:12:13,170  -->  00:12:13,180

600

00:12:13,180  -->  00:12:16,680
how to apply a datasource filter which

601

00:12:16,680  -->  00:12:16,690

602

00:12:16,690  -->  00:12:19,770
can help you deal with large datasets. So

603

00:12:19,770  -->  00:12:19,780

604

00:12:19,780  -->  00:12:21,480
that's all for today, in the next

605

00:12:21,480  -->  00:12:21,490

606

00:12:21,490  -->  00:12:25,200
tutorial, we will do the pivot and will

607

00:12:25,200  -->  00:12:25,210

608

00:12:25,210  -->  00:12:27,360
also do a split and I look forward to

609

00:12:27,360  -->  00:12:27,370

610

00:12:27,370  -->  00:12:28,290
seeing you next time.

611

00:12:28,290  -->  00:12:28,300

612

00:12:28,300  -->  00:12:34,860
Until then, happy analyzing!
