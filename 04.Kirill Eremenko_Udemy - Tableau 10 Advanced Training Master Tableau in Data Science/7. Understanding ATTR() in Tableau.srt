00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:06,740
Hello welcome back to the advanced

2

00:00:06,740  -->  00:00:06,750

3

00:00:06,750  -->  00:00:08,120
course in Tableau. In the previous

4

00:00:08,120  -->  00:00:08,130

5

00:00:08,130  -->  00:00:10,850
tutorial we discussed the first level of

6

00:00:10,850  -->  00:00:10,860

7

00:00:10,860  -->  00:00:13,459
detail calculation which was include

8

00:00:13,459  -->  00:00:13,469

9

00:00:13,469  -->  00:00:16,700
level of detail calculation. I hope you

10

00:00:16,700  -->  00:00:16,710

11

00:00:16,710  -->  00:00:19,939
enjoyed the tutorial and you picked up

12

00:00:19,939  -->  00:00:19,949

13

00:00:19,949  -->  00:00:21,890
quite a few new things from there and

14

00:00:21,890  -->  00:00:21,900

15

00:00:21,900  -->  00:00:23,029
most importantly I hope you had the

16

00:00:23,029  -->  00:00:23,039

17

00:00:23,039  -->  00:00:25,519
opportunity to revise what we learned

18

00:00:25,519  -->  00:00:25,529

19

00:00:25,529  -->  00:00:28,130
and to some additional practice and

20

00:00:28,130  -->  00:00:28,140

21

00:00:28,140  -->  00:00:29,179
today we're going to have a very quick

22

00:00:29,179  -->  00:00:29,189

23

00:00:29,189  -->  00:00:30,919
tutorial which will allow us to

24

00:00:30,919  -->  00:00:30,929

25

00:00:30,929  -->  00:00:34,310
understand the attribute function or the

26

00:00:34,310  -->  00:00:34,320

27

00:00:34,320  -->  00:00:37,850
ATTR function in Tableau and we'll find

28

00:00:37,850  -->  00:00:37,860

29

00:00:37,860  -->  00:00:40,310
out what it's for because in the coming

30

00:00:40,310  -->  00:00:40,320

31

00:00:40,320  -->  00:00:42,290
tutorials when we talk about the exclude

32

00:00:42,290  -->  00:00:42,300

33

00:00:42,300  -->  00:00:44,119
and the fixed level of detail

34

00:00:44,119  -->  00:00:44,129

35

00:00:44,129  -->  00:00:46,490
calculations we will actually need that

36

00:00:46,490  -->  00:00:46,500

37

00:00:46,500  -->  00:00:50,270
function in our work we'll be using it so

38

00:00:50,270  -->  00:00:50,280

39

00:00:50,280  -->  00:00:52,310
it's a good idea to quickly revise or

40

00:00:52,310  -->  00:00:52,320

41

00:00:52,320  -->  00:00:53,630
learn what it does.

42

00:00:53,630  -->  00:00:53,640

43

00:00:53,640  -->  00:00:55,910
Alright so let's get straight to it, I'm

44

00:00:55,910  -->  00:00:55,920

45

00:00:55,920  -->  00:00:57,439
going to take the map that we have here

46

00:00:57,439  -->  00:00:57,449

47

00:00:57,449  -->  00:01:00,229
I'm going to duplicate sheet and move it

48

00:01:00,229  -->  00:01:00,239

49

00:01:00,239  -->  00:01:02,599
here and I'll just call it

50

00:01:02,599  -->  00:01:02,609

51

00:01:02,609  -->  00:01:08,840
ATTR Investegation and so as you

52

00:01:08,840  -->  00:01:08,850

53

00:01:08,850  -->  00:01:11,120
can see we're kind of not even bothering

54

00:01:11,120  -->  00:01:11,130

55

00:01:11,130  -->  00:01:13,250
with the level of detail calculations at

56

00:01:13,250  -->  00:01:13,260

57

00:01:13,260  -->  00:01:15,140
this stage we just want to understand

58

00:01:15,140  -->  00:01:15,150

59

00:01:15,150  -->  00:01:17,030
the ATR and what it does.

60

00:01:17,030  -->  00:01:17,040

61

00:01:17,040  -->  00:01:19,160
So let me show you first what I'm

62

00:01:19,160  -->  00:01:19,170

63

00:01:19,170  -->  00:01:22,670
talking about, if I take for example city

64

00:01:22,670  -->  00:01:22,680

65

00:01:22,680  -->  00:01:28,010
here and I drag it into color or that's

66

00:01:28,010  -->  00:01:28,020

67

00:01:28,020  -->  00:01:30,170
a bit too much here let's say into

68

00:01:30,170  -->  00:01:30,180

69

00:01:30,180  -->  00:01:32,960
detail then what will happen is it will

70

00:01:32,960  -->  00:01:32,970

71

00:01:32,970  -->  00:01:36,080
change my visualization, right? It will

72

00:01:36,080  -->  00:01:36,090

73

00:01:36,090  -->  00:01:38,569
change the level of granularity of

74

00:01:38,569  -->  00:01:38,579

75

00:01:38,579  -->  00:01:41,060
visualization if I can do the same

76

00:01:41,060  -->  00:01:41,070

77

00:01:41,070  -->  00:01:44,179
thing, I can do well let's try color so I

78

00:01:44,179  -->  00:01:44,189

79

00:01:44,189  -->  00:01:46,520
was able to drag city into color as you

80

00:01:46,520  -->  00:01:46,530

81

00:01:46,530  -->  00:01:49,010
can see it's again so if I take city if

82

00:01:49,010  -->  00:01:49,020

83

00:01:49,020  -->  00:01:50,810
I remove city,

84

00:01:50,810  -->  00:01:50,820

85

00:01:50,820  -->  00:01:54,770
let's just remove it this way if I

86

00:01:54,770  -->  00:01:54,780

87

00:01:54,780  -->  00:01:56,450
remove city we're back at the previous

88

00:01:56,450  -->  00:01:56,460

89

00:01:56,460  -->  00:02:00,380
level of granularity added to color and

90

00:02:00,380  -->  00:02:00,390

91

00:02:00,390  -->  00:02:02,959
now it's my level of granularity has

92

00:02:02,959  -->  00:02:02,969

93

00:02:02,969  -->  00:02:06,230
changed again or I can do the same trick

94

00:02:06,230  -->  00:02:06,240

95

00:02:06,240  -->  00:02:08,859
let's just do this field map

96

00:02:08,859  -->  00:02:08,869

97

00:02:08,869  -->  00:02:12,250
and now if I do city and or actually had

98

00:02:12,250  -->  00:02:12,260

99

00:02:12,260  -->  00:02:14,140
profit here so let's put profit on to

100

00:02:14,140  -->  00:02:14,150

101

00:02:14,150  -->  00:02:16,240
color and for this city and put on the

102

00:02:16,240  -->  00:02:16,250

103

00:02:16,250  -->  00:02:19,119
size, you can see that that changes again

104

00:02:19,119  -->  00:02:19,129

105

00:02:19,129  -->  00:02:22,000
my level of granularity. So basically I'm

106

00:02:22,000  -->  00:02:22,010

107

00:02:22,010  -->  00:02:24,610
showing you that all these options, all

108

00:02:24,610  -->  00:02:24,620

109

00:02:24,620  -->  00:02:26,530
of these boxes that you can select from

110

00:02:26,530  -->  00:02:26,540

111

00:02:26,540  -->  00:02:29,710
they will change the granularity of your

112

00:02:29,710  -->  00:02:29,720

113

00:02:29,720  -->  00:02:31,360
visualizations, so will the columns and rows.

114

00:02:31,360  -->  00:02:31,370

115

00:02:31,370  -->  00:02:33,880
What won't change is the tool tip over

116

00:02:33,880  -->  00:02:33,890

117

00:02:33,890  -->  00:02:35,740
here, so if I take city and drag onto

118

00:02:35,740  -->  00:02:35,750

119

00:02:35,750  -->  00:02:38,710
tooltip it won't change the level of

120

00:02:38,710  -->  00:02:38,720

121

00:02:38,720  -->  00:02:42,339
aggregation but it will add the city

122

00:02:42,339  -->  00:02:42,349

123

00:02:42,349  -->  00:02:45,640
dimension into your tool tips. So if you

124

00:02:45,640  -->  00:02:45,650

125

00:02:45,650  -->  00:02:49,089
go over any state you'll see and you

126

00:02:49,089  -->  00:02:49,099

127

00:02:49,099  -->  00:02:50,949
call a new line appear here which says

128

00:02:50,949  -->  00:02:50,959

129

00:02:50,959  -->  00:02:53,830
city, and in this case it says just star.

130

00:02:53,830  -->  00:02:53,840

131

00:02:53,840  -->  00:02:55,300
So this is what we're going to talk

132

00:02:55,300  -->  00:02:55,310

133

00:02:55,310  -->  00:02:57,610
about, why does it say star and what is

134

00:02:57,610  -->  00:02:57,620

135

00:02:57,620  -->  00:02:58,000
this

136

00:02:58,000  -->  00:02:58,010

137

00:02:58,010  -->  00:03:00,729
ATTR over here what is this function?

138

00:03:00,729  -->  00:03:00,739

139

00:03:00,739  -->  00:03:02,979
What does it do? So in order to give us

140

00:03:02,979  -->  00:03:02,989

141

00:03:02,989  -->  00:03:04,569
some assistance we're going to bring up

142

00:03:04,569  -->  00:03:04,579

143

00:03:04,579  -->  00:03:06,759
the Tableau help so you can just go to help,

144

00:03:06,759  -->  00:03:06,769

145

00:03:06,769  -->  00:03:09,729
open help or click f1 and then brings it

146

00:03:09,729  -->  00:03:09,739

147

00:03:09,739  -->  00:03:11,740
up in a browser and now we're here at

148

00:03:11,740  -->  00:03:11,750

149

00:03:11,750  -->  00:03:13,960
the top we're going to search for ATTR.

150

00:03:13,960  -->  00:03:13,970

151

00:03:13,970  -->  00:03:16,120
We're going to go to aggregate functions

152

00:03:16,120  -->  00:03:16,130

153

00:03:16,130  -->  00:03:18,640
and there is ATTR and then expression,

154

00:03:18,640  -->  00:03:18,650

155

00:03:18,650  -->  00:03:20,620
so what does it do? It returns the value

156

00:03:20,620  -->  00:03:20,630

157

00:03:20,630  -->  00:03:22,870
of the expression if it has a single

158

00:03:22,870  -->  00:03:22,880

159

00:03:22,880  -->  00:03:24,940
value for all rows.

160

00:03:24,940  -->  00:03:24,950

161

00:03:24,950  -->  00:03:27,490
Otherwise, returns an asterisk, null values

162

00:03:27,490  -->  00:03:27,500

163

00:03:27,500  -->  00:03:30,729
are ignored and so what what does this

164

00:03:30,729  -->  00:03:30,739

165

00:03:30,739  -->  00:03:33,430
mean and how do we work with this?

166

00:03:33,430  -->  00:03:33,440

167

00:03:33,440  -->  00:03:36,550
Well let's think about it, if we added 80

168

00:03:36,550  -->  00:03:36,560

169

00:03:36,560  -->  00:03:41,199
we added city to our map right but if we

170

00:03:41,199  -->  00:03:41,209

171

00:03:41,209  -->  00:03:43,809
know that in every single state there is

172

00:03:43,809  -->  00:03:43,819

173

00:03:43,819  -->  00:03:46,539
there are multiple cities so there's no

174

00:03:46,539  -->  00:03:46,549

175

00:03:46,549  -->  00:03:48,789
way that Tableau can just pick one of

176

00:03:48,789  -->  00:03:48,799

177

00:03:48,799  -->  00:03:50,619
those cities for instance in North

178

00:03:50,619  -->  00:03:50,629

179

00:03:50,629  -->  00:03:51,970
Dakota we know that there's three cities.

180

00:03:51,970  -->  00:03:51,980

181

00:03:51,980  -->  00:03:53,830
How is Tableau going to pick one of the

182

00:03:53,830  -->  00:03:53,840

183

00:03:53,840  -->  00:03:56,409
cities and split over here for us? It

184

00:03:56,409  -->  00:03:56,419

185

00:03:56,419  -->  00:03:58,000
can't do that right so that's why it's

186

00:03:58,000  -->  00:03:58,010

187

00:03:58,010  -->  00:04:02,140
specifying a star because it there's no

188

00:04:02,140  -->  00:04:02,150

189

00:04:02,150  -->  00:04:05,920
unique city in the city in that state is

190

00:04:05,920  -->  00:04:05,930

191

00:04:05,930  -->  00:04:07,869
not unique it cannot do that for us it

192

00:04:07,869  -->  00:04:07,879

193

00:04:07,879  -->  00:04:10,479
cannot just pick around the city, it's just

194

00:04:10,479  -->  00:04:10,489

195

00:04:10,489  -->  00:04:12,970
the star is telling us that there are

196

00:04:12,970  -->  00:04:12,980

197

00:04:12,980  -->  00:04:15,610
multiple options and you can just apply

198

00:04:15,610  -->  00:04:15,620

199

00:04:15,620  -->  00:04:18,490
one of them, whereas if we take this out

200

00:04:18,490  -->  00:04:18,500

201

00:04:18,500  -->  00:04:21,680
and let's say for example we take

202

00:04:21,680  -->  00:04:21,690

203

00:04:21,690  -->  00:04:24,200
country and we put country into the

204

00:04:24,200  -->  00:04:24,210

205

00:04:24,210  -->  00:04:27,830
tooltip, now we know that in every single

206

00:04:27,830  -->  00:04:27,840

207

00:04:27,840  -->  00:04:29,840
state or across the whole database

208

00:04:29,840  -->  00:04:29,850

209

00:04:29,850  -->  00:04:32,270
actually we have only one country which

210

00:04:32,270  -->  00:04:32,280

211

00:04:32,280  -->  00:04:35,360
is United States and so therefore the

212

00:04:35,360  -->  00:04:35,370

213

00:04:35,370  -->  00:04:37,190
country's working fine the country

214

00:04:37,190  -->  00:04:37,200

215

00:04:37,200  -->  00:04:39,290
dimension and our tool tip is working

216

00:04:39,290  -->  00:04:39,300

217

00:04:39,300  -->  00:04:41,750
fine because there isn't Tableau doesn't

218

00:04:41,750  -->  00:04:41,760

219

00:04:41,760  -->  00:04:43,550
have to make a choice even know that

220

00:04:43,550  -->  00:04:43,560

221

00:04:43,560  -->  00:04:45,590
there is a certain aggregation that is

222

00:04:45,590  -->  00:04:45,600

223

00:04:45,600  -->  00:04:49,580
happening and rows of our data set out

224

00:04:49,580  -->  00:04:49,590

225

00:04:49,590  -->  00:04:53,090
being aggregated to this state all of

226

00:04:53,090  -->  00:04:53,100

227

00:04:53,100  -->  00:04:54,830
those rows have the same country and

228

00:04:54,830  -->  00:04:54,840

229

00:04:54,840  -->  00:04:56,450
therefore Tableau can apply that same

230

00:04:56,450  -->  00:04:56,460

231

00:04:56,460  -->  00:04:58,130
another country here. That is exactly

232

00:04:58,130  -->  00:04:58,140

233

00:04:58,140  -->  00:05:01,970
what that Tableau help illustrate for us.

234

00:05:01,970  -->  00:05:01,980

235

00:05:01,980  -->  00:05:03,920
Returns the value of expression has single

236

00:05:03,920  -->  00:05:03,930

237

00:05:03,930  -->  00:05:05,420
value for all rows.

238

00:05:05,420  -->  00:05:05,430

239

00:05:05,430  -->  00:05:07,460
Let's try another one, let's remove

240

00:05:07,460  -->  00:05:07,470

241

00:05:07,470  -->  00:05:12,830
country and let's say we'll try region.

242

00:05:12,830  -->  00:05:12,840

243

00:05:12,840  -->  00:05:15,590
So region is not part of our

244

00:05:15,590  -->  00:05:15,600

245

00:05:15,600  -->  00:05:17,780
geographical hierarchy but same time

246

00:05:17,780  -->  00:05:17,790

247

00:05:17,790  -->  00:05:21,650
region is you know west or east of

248

00:05:21,650  -->  00:05:21,660

249

00:05:21,660  -->  00:05:24,530
central and so on so let's add it to our tooltip.

250

00:05:24,530  -->  00:05:24,540

251

00:05:24,540  -->  00:05:26,540
Let's have a look here, so you can see

252

00:05:26,540  -->  00:05:26,550

253

00:05:26,550  -->  00:05:30,440
region west, region west, region central

254

00:05:30,440  -->  00:05:30,450

255

00:05:30,450  -->  00:05:37,490
region central, region south, south and

256

00:05:37,490  -->  00:05:37,500

257

00:05:37,500  -->  00:05:41,360
region east. So it is working because it is,

258

00:05:41,360  -->  00:05:41,370

259

00:05:41,370  -->  00:05:44,210
the data set instruction such a way that

260

00:05:44,210  -->  00:05:44,220

261

00:05:44,220  -->  00:05:49,490
all of the social take any given state if

262

00:05:49,490  -->  00:05:49,500

263

00:05:49,500  -->  00:05:52,460
you take where are we? Where are the state? You

264

00:05:52,460  -->  00:05:52,470

265

00:05:52,470  -->  00:05:57,230
take any given state there, for example

266

00:05:57,230  -->  00:05:57,240

267

00:05:57,240  -->  00:05:59,810
Alabama you'll see that every single row

268

00:05:59,810  -->  00:05:59,820

269

00:05:59,820  -->  00:06:04,490
in that state has the region south so and

270

00:06:04,490  -->  00:06:04,500

271

00:06:04,500  -->  00:06:06,560
that would that is what the ATTR

272

00:06:06,560  -->  00:06:06,570

273

00:06:06,570  -->  00:06:09,590
function does. The way to think whether

274

00:06:09,590  -->  00:06:09,600

275

00:06:09,600  -->  00:06:11,000
the way I think of it is

276

00:06:11,000  -->  00:06:11,010

277

00:06:11,010  -->  00:06:16,940
ATTR, it applies or it pastes a certain

278

00:06:16,940  -->  00:06:16,950

279

00:06:16,950  -->  00:06:21,710
value from your rows onto your

280

00:06:21,710  -->  00:06:21,720

281

00:06:21,720  -->  00:06:25,670
aggregated mark. So here we've got states,

282

00:06:25,670  -->  00:06:25,680

283

00:06:25,680  -->  00:06:27,980
that's we've got 49, you can see on the

284

00:06:27,980  -->  00:06:27,990

285

00:06:27,990  -->  00:06:30,800
left here, we've got forty nine marks and so if

286

00:06:30,800  -->  00:06:30,810

287

00:06:30,810  -->  00:06:32,330
there's an opportunity to do so,

288

00:06:32,330  -->  00:06:32,340

289

00:06:32,340  -->  00:06:34,770
ATTR will paste

290

00:06:34,770  -->  00:06:34,780

291

00:06:34,780  -->  00:06:38,490
the mark on to your or it will paste the

292

00:06:38,490  -->  00:06:38,500

293

00:06:38,500  -->  00:06:41,100
value that you're after on to your state and

294

00:06:41,100  -->  00:06:41,110

295

00:06:41,110  -->  00:06:44,070
ATTR doesn't have to be applied just with

296

00:06:44,070  -->  00:06:44,080

297

00:06:44,080  -->  00:06:46,140
the tooltip. You can apply you'll see it

298

00:06:46,140  -->  00:06:46,150

299

00:06:46,150  -->  00:06:49,830
to come up here and there, not

300

00:06:49,830  -->  00:06:49,840

301

00:06:49,840  -->  00:06:51,450
just the tooltip in other calculations

302

00:06:51,450  -->  00:06:51,460

303

00:06:51,460  -->  00:06:53,700
and that's what we'll see inside this

304

00:06:53,700  -->  00:06:53,710

305

00:06:53,710  -->  00:06:55,680
section but it's just quickest way to

306

00:06:55,680  -->  00:06:55,690

307

00:06:55,690  -->  00:06:57,540
demonstrate this function is through the

308

00:06:57,540  -->  00:06:57,550

309

00:06:57,550  -->  00:06:59,280
tooltip. Alright so hopefully that makes

310

00:06:59,280  -->  00:06:59,290

311

00:06:59,290  -->  00:07:03,420
sense, so ATTR basically if the values

312

00:07:03,420  -->  00:07:03,430

313

00:07:03,430  -->  00:07:05,940
are unique it all if there's only one

314

00:07:05,940  -->  00:07:05,950

315

00:07:05,950  -->  00:07:08,340
value for all of the rows that are being

316

00:07:08,340  -->  00:07:08,350

317

00:07:08,350  -->  00:07:10,500
aggregated it will use that value if the

318

00:07:10,500  -->  00:07:10,510

319

00:07:10,510  -->  00:07:12,300
values are different so if there's at

320

00:07:12,300  -->  00:07:12,310

321

00:07:12,310  -->  00:07:14,010
least two different values for the

322

00:07:14,010  -->  00:07:14,020

323

00:07:14,020  -->  00:07:15,930
aggregate rows for instance in

324

00:07:15,930  -->  00:07:15,940

325

00:07:15,940  -->  00:07:18,870
California there's many different cities

326

00:07:18,870  -->  00:07:18,880

327

00:07:18,880  -->  00:07:20,610
it will just give you a star indicating

328

00:07:20,610  -->  00:07:20,620

329

00:07:20,620  -->  00:07:22,170
that it couldn't the function can be

330

00:07:22,170  -->  00:07:22,180

331

00:07:22,180  -->  00:07:25,920
applied properly. So that's how the ATTR

332

00:07:25,920  -->  00:07:25,930

333

00:07:25,930  -->  00:07:29,190
function works and we'll be using it in

334

00:07:29,190  -->  00:07:29,200

335

00:07:29,200  -->  00:07:31,380
this section of the course. I hope you

336

00:07:31,380  -->  00:07:31,390

337

00:07:31,390  -->  00:07:33,510
