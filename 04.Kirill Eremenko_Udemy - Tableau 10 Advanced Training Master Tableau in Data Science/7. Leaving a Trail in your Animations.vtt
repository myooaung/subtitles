00:00:03.190  -->  00:00:06.390
Hello and welcome back to the advanced

2

00:00:06.390  -->  00:00:06.400

3

00:00:06.400  -->  00:00:08.340
course on Tableau. Today we're going to

4

00:00:08.340  -->  00:00:08.350

5

00:00:08.350  -->  00:00:10.860
learn some advanced techniques relating

6

00:00:10.860  -->  00:00:10.870

7

00:00:10.870  -->  00:00:13.770
to animations. So here we are with our

8

00:00:13.770  -->  00:00:13.780

9

00:00:13.780  -->  00:00:16.350
animation which is already pretty pretty

10

00:00:16.350  -->  00:00:16.360

11

00:00:16.360  -->  00:00:20.100
great. Once again, let's play that this is

12

00:00:20.100  -->  00:00:20.110

13

00:00:20.110  -->  00:00:24.180
how fertility rate life expectancy and

14

00:00:24.180  -->  00:00:24.190

15

00:00:24.190  -->  00:00:26.070
population have been changing over the

16

00:00:26.070  -->  00:00:26.080

17

00:00:26.080  -->  00:00:27.330
past 50 years.

18

00:00:27.330  -->  00:00:27.340

19

00:00:27.340  -->  00:00:30.390
How can we add additional features to

20

00:00:30.390  -->  00:00:30.400

21

00:00:30.400  -->  00:00:32.100
this visualization that will allow the

22

00:00:32.100  -->  00:00:32.110

23

00:00:32.110  -->  00:00:35.549
users to extract more insights?

24

00:00:35.549  -->  00:00:35.559

25

00:00:35.559  -->  00:00:38.639
Well there is a way and that way is

26

00:00:38.639  -->  00:00:38.649

27

00:00:38.649  -->  00:00:41.040
through this option over here which is

28

00:00:41.040  -->  00:00:41.050

29

00:00:41.050  -->  00:00:42.930
show history. So I'm just going to click

30

00:00:42.930  -->  00:00:42.940

31

00:00:42.940  -->  00:00:46.680
this checkbox and I will show what that

32

00:00:46.680  -->  00:00:46.690

33

00:00:46.690  -->  00:00:48.989
does, so once you click the checkbox it

34

00:00:48.989  -->  00:00:48.999

35

00:00:48.999  -->  00:00:51.540
might take a few seconds to calculate

36

00:00:51.540  -->  00:00:51.550

37

00:00:51.550  -->  00:00:53.579
because it is adding a quite a lot to

38

00:00:53.579  -->  00:00:53.589

39

00:00:53.589  -->  00:00:56.069
the visualization as you'll see and what

40

00:00:56.069  -->  00:00:56.079

41

00:00:56.079  -->  00:00:58.919
you can do now is if you click any given

42

00:00:58.919  -->  00:00:58.929

43

00:00:58.929  -->  00:01:01.349
circle so let's look at let's say India

44

00:01:01.349  -->  00:01:01.359

45

00:01:01.359  -->  00:01:03.419
for instance and now you click play

46

00:01:03.419  -->  00:01:03.429

47

00:01:03.429  -->  00:01:06.149
which will notice is that it leaves a

48

00:01:06.149  -->  00:01:06.159

49

00:01:06.159  -->  00:01:07.140
trail.

50

00:01:07.140  -->  00:01:07.150

51

00:01:07.150  -->  00:01:09.900
How cool is that? You can actually see

52

00:01:09.900  -->  00:01:09.910

53

00:01:09.910  -->  00:01:14.220
how this country was developing and you

54

00:01:14.220  -->  00:01:14.230

55

00:01:14.230  -->  00:01:17.460
can put your mouse over this trail and

56

00:01:17.460  -->  00:01:17.470

57

00:01:17.470  -->  00:01:19.230
will tell you for every single year what

58

00:01:19.230  -->  00:01:19.240

59

00:01:19.240  -->  00:01:21.750
the population was, the fertility rate, life

60

00:01:21.750  -->  00:01:21.760

61

00:01:21.760  -->  00:01:24.720
expectancy and so on. So that is very

62

00:01:24.720  -->  00:01:24.730

63

00:01:24.730  -->  00:01:25.920
powerful.

64

00:01:25.920  -->  00:01:25.930

65

00:01:25.930  -->  00:01:28.530
Let's do another one, let's say let's

66

00:01:28.530  -->  00:01:28.540

67

00:01:28.540  -->  00:01:29.910
pick a smaller country what is that?

68

00:01:29.910  -->  00:01:29.920

69

00:01:29.920  -->  00:01:32.700
Solomon Islands, let's click play.

70

00:01:32.700  -->  00:01:32.710

71

00:01:32.710  -->  00:01:37.590
Interesting pattern isn't it? So first

72

00:01:37.590  -->  00:01:37.600

73

00:01:37.600  -->  00:01:40.080
the fertility rate increase then it

74

00:01:40.080  -->  00:01:40.090

75

00:01:40.090  -->  00:01:43.080
started decreasing at the same time life

76

00:01:43.080  -->  00:01:43.090

77

00:01:43.090  -->  00:01:45.300
expectancy went up they are starting going down.

78

00:01:45.300  -->  00:01:45.310

79

00:01:45.310  -->  00:01:47.970
In 1988 apparently something was

80

00:01:47.970  -->  00:01:47.980

81

00:01:47.980  -->  00:01:50.610
happening in those periods and then it started

82

00:01:50.610  -->  00:01:50.620

83

00:01:50.620  -->  00:01:53.040
going to wear all of the countries are

84

00:01:53.040  -->  00:01:53.050

85

00:01:53.050  -->  00:01:56.580
going to into this top left quadrant.

86

00:01:56.580  -->  00:01:56.590

87

00:01:56.590  -->  00:02:00.300
Interesting pattern and also you can or

88

00:02:00.300  -->  00:02:00.310

89

00:02:00.310  -->  00:02:01.920
the user of your dashboard now can not

90

00:02:01.920  -->  00:02:01.930

91

00:02:01.930  -->  00:02:04.200
just wait and select the start each

92

00:02:04.200  -->  00:02:04.210

93

00:02:04.210  -->  00:02:06.180
individual country. They can look at the

94

00:02:06.180  -->  00:02:06.190

95

00:02:06.190  -->  00:02:07.649
country that they're interested in. Let's

96

00:02:07.649  -->  00:02:07.659

97

00:02:07.659  -->  00:02:09.419
say they are interested in this country

98

00:02:09.419  -->  00:02:09.429

99

00:02:09.429  -->  00:02:11.580
Syrian, Arab Republic and if you click on

100

00:02:11.580  -->  00:02:11.590

101

00:02:11.590  -->  00:02:14.190
it, you will see the trail so you don't

102

00:02:14.190  -->  00:02:14.200

103

00:02:14.200  -->  00:02:15.470
have to replay the visualization

104

00:02:15.470  -->  00:02:15.480

105

00:02:15.480  -->  00:02:17.540
for the trail trip here or South Africa

106

00:02:17.540  -->  00:02:17.550

107

00:02:17.550  -->  00:02:19.250
for instance, what is going on there

108

00:02:19.250  -->  00:02:19.260

109

00:02:19.260  -->  00:02:23.390
so what happened there 1992-93 life

110

00:02:23.390  -->  00:02:23.400

111

00:02:23.400  -->  00:02:25.009
expectancy dropped and now it's going

112

00:02:25.009  -->  00:02:25.019

113

00:02:25.019  -->  00:02:27.800
back up so you can study every single

114

00:02:27.800  -->  00:02:27.810

115

00:02:27.810  -->  00:02:31.399
country just by itself through this

116

00:02:31.399  -->  00:02:31.409

117

00:02:31.409  -->  00:02:34.430
visualization but still look at it in

118

00:02:34.430  -->  00:02:34.440

119

00:02:34.440  -->  00:02:36.380
terms of the overall tendencies and

120

00:02:36.380  -->  00:02:36.390

121

00:02:36.390  -->  00:02:38.119
trends you can pause this visualization

122

00:02:38.119  -->  00:02:38.129

123

00:02:38.129  -->  00:02:40.309
wherever you want and see what happened

124

00:02:40.309  -->  00:02:40.319

125

00:02:40.319  -->  00:02:42.530
up to that year and that is exactly what

126

00:02:42.530  -->  00:02:42.540

127

00:02:42.540  -->  00:02:44.809
the challenge was asking for it was

128

00:02:44.809  -->  00:02:44.819

129

00:02:44.819  -->  00:02:47.270
asking for the overall trends so you can

130

00:02:47.270  -->  00:02:47.280

131

00:02:47.280  -->  00:02:48.770
see them through the visualization

132

00:02:48.770  -->  00:02:48.780

133

00:02:48.780  -->  00:02:51.140
through the animation and also is asking

134

00:02:51.140  -->  00:02:51.150

135

00:02:51.150  -->  00:02:53.569
for an ability to drill down into

136

00:02:53.569  -->  00:02:53.579

137

00:02:53.579  -->  00:02:56.690
individual countries and look at their

138

00:02:56.690  -->  00:02:56.700

139

00:02:56.700  -->  00:02:58.640
development history and there you go

140

00:02:58.640  -->  00:02:58.650

141

00:02:58.650  -->  00:03:01.490
there is your history for each

142

00:03:01.490  -->  00:03:01.500

143

00:03:01.500  -->  00:03:03.890
individual country select whichever one

144

00:03:03.890  -->  00:03:03.900

145

00:03:03.900  -->  00:03:07.430
you want and you will get a pattern. So

146

00:03:07.430  -->  00:03:07.440

147

00:03:07.440  -->  00:03:09.229
that's a good start, now let's explore

148

00:03:09.229  -->  00:03:09.239

149

00:03:09.239  -->  00:03:11.000
this show history option in a bit more

150

00:03:11.000  -->  00:03:11.010

151

00:03:11.010  -->  00:03:12.979
detail. What else do we have here?

152

00:03:12.979  -->  00:03:12.989

153

00:03:12.989  -->  00:03:15.830
Well the other options that we have is

154

00:03:15.830  -->  00:03:15.840

155

00:03:15.840  -->  00:03:18.890
we can change the marks to a trail so

156

00:03:18.890  -->  00:03:18.900

157

00:03:18.900  -->  00:03:21.020
let's do that once again a bit of

158

00:03:21.020  -->  00:03:21.030

159

00:03:21.030  -->  00:03:23.270
calculation and now if we go back to

160

00:03:23.270  -->  00:03:23.280

161

00:03:23.280  -->  00:03:25.759
start and let's say we select china and

162

00:03:25.759  -->  00:03:25.769

163

00:03:25.769  -->  00:03:27.890
click Play what you'll see is instead of

164

00:03:27.890  -->  00:03:27.900

165

00:03:27.900  -->  00:03:31.099
marks being left behind you can actually

166

00:03:31.099  -->  00:03:31.109

167

00:03:31.109  -->  00:03:34.580
see like just the line so in this case

168

00:03:34.580  -->  00:03:34.590

169

00:03:34.590  -->  00:03:36.319
you can't put your mouse over the line

170

00:03:36.319  -->  00:03:36.329

171

00:03:36.329  -->  00:03:39.050
won't tell you anything so it's less

172

00:03:39.050  -->  00:03:39.060

173

00:03:39.060  -->  00:03:42.500
informative but it's might be more

174

00:03:42.500  -->  00:03:42.510

175

00:03:42.510  -->  00:03:44.659
applicable to certain types of animation.

176

00:03:44.659  -->  00:03:44.669

177

00:03:44.669  -->  00:03:47.300
So in every animation we'll have its own

178

00:03:47.300  -->  00:03:47.310

179

00:03:47.310  -->  00:03:49.970
features, its own requirements and you might

180

00:03:49.970  -->  00:03:49.980

181

00:03:49.980  -->  00:03:53.270
want to have this line rather than faded

182

00:03:53.270  -->  00:03:53.280

183

00:03:53.280  -->  00:03:57.289
marks for a specific animation and so

184

00:03:57.289  -->  00:03:57.299

185

00:03:57.299  -->  00:03:58.759
there you go that's what you can achieve

186

00:03:58.759  -->  00:03:58.769

187

00:03:58.769  -->  00:04:00.949
with the lines. You have some more

188

00:04:00.949  -->  00:04:00.959

189

00:04:00.959  -->  00:04:05.030
controls here, so you can format your

190

00:04:05.030  -->  00:04:05.040

191

00:04:05.040  -->  00:04:06.740
trail so you can make it like a dotted

192

00:04:06.740  -->  00:04:06.750

193

00:04:06.750  -->  00:04:07.520
line.

194

00:04:07.520  -->  00:04:07.530

195

00:04:07.530  -->  00:04:09.559
Let's see that update or or even more

196

00:04:09.559  -->  00:04:09.569

197

00:04:09.569  -->  00:04:11.839
dotted line so you're going to change

198

00:04:11.839  -->  00:04:11.849

199

00:04:11.849  -->  00:04:13.339
the color so if you would like you can

200

00:04:13.339  -->  00:04:13.349

201

00:04:13.349  -->  00:04:15.979
make all the trails I just changed with,

202

00:04:15.979  -->  00:04:15.989

203

00:04:15.989  -->  00:04:17.750
there you go if you want to change the

204

00:04:17.750  -->  00:04:17.760

205

00:04:17.760  -->  00:04:19.550
colors you can make all the trails black

206

00:04:19.550  -->  00:04:19.560

207

00:04:19.560  -->  00:04:22.610
if you want things like that so play

208

00:04:22.610  -->  00:04:22.620

209

00:04:22.620  -->  00:04:24.230
around with that and and see what you

210

00:04:24.230  -->  00:04:24.240

211

00:04:24.240  -->  00:04:25.760
discover I'm just going to leave it at

212

00:04:25.760  -->  00:04:25.770

213

00:04:25.770  -->  00:04:26.870
standard.

214

00:04:26.870  -->  00:04:26.880

215

00:04:26.880  -->  00:04:29.720
And now I wanted to show you two more

216

00:04:29.720  -->  00:04:29.730

217

00:04:29.730  -->  00:04:31.910
other ways you can present your data.

218

00:04:31.910  -->  00:04:31.920

219

00:04:31.920  -->  00:04:33.710
Of course you can combine your marks and

220

00:04:33.710  -->  00:04:33.720

221

00:04:33.720  -->  00:04:36.740
trails by clicking both. I'm not

222

00:04:36.740  -->  00:04:36.750

223

00:04:36.750  -->  00:04:38.090
going to do that now.

224

00:04:38.090  -->  00:04:38.100

225

00:04:38.100  -->  00:04:40.340
Oh well I did click it so there you go

226

00:04:40.340  -->  00:04:40.350

227

00:04:40.350  -->  00:04:43.250
that's that's what it looks like but

228

00:04:43.250  -->  00:04:43.260

229

00:04:43.260  -->  00:04:45.380
what I really wanted to show you is

230

00:04:45.380  -->  00:04:45.390

231

00:04:45.390  -->  00:04:48.110
which marks the history will be shown

232

00:04:48.110  -->  00:04:48.120

233

00:04:48.120  -->  00:04:49.820
for, so you can select you can select

234

00:04:49.820  -->  00:04:49.830

235

00:04:49.830  -->  00:04:53.480
highlighted, selected all or manual now

236

00:04:53.480  -->  00:04:53.490

237

00:04:53.490  -->  00:04:56.300
let's put this back on to marks and i'm

238

00:04:56.300  -->  00:04:56.310

239

00:04:56.310  -->  00:04:58.640
going to drag this to the start first

240

00:04:58.640  -->  00:04:58.650

241

00:04:58.650  -->  00:05:00.050
and I'm going to go in here and I'm

242

00:05:00.050  -->  00:05:00.060

243

00:05:00.060  -->  00:05:02.600
going to select show history for all and

244

00:05:02.600  -->  00:05:02.610

245

00:05:02.610  -->  00:05:05.810
let's watch how this unravels click Play

246

00:05:05.810  -->  00:05:05.820

247

00:05:05.820  -->  00:05:08.600
and as you can see the history is being

248

00:05:08.600  -->  00:05:08.610

249

00:05:08.610  -->  00:05:10.700
shown for every single mark it might be

250

00:05:10.700  -->  00:05:10.710

251

00:05:10.710  -->  00:05:12.230
a bit confusing but it looks pretty

252

00:05:12.230  -->  00:05:12.240

253

00:05:12.240  -->  00:05:16.910
amazing and once again you can explore

254

00:05:16.910  -->  00:05:16.920

255

00:05:16.920  -->  00:05:18.500
every country but of course it is too

256

00:05:18.500  -->  00:05:18.510

257

00:05:18.510  -->  00:05:20.270
cluttered although you might find this

258

00:05:20.270  -->  00:05:20.280

259

00:05:20.280  -->  00:05:21.890
handy for some of the visualizations

260

00:05:21.890  -->  00:05:21.900

261

00:05:21.900  -->  00:05:24.110
that you will be creating. So let's go

262

00:05:24.110  -->  00:05:24.120

263

00:05:24.120  -->  00:05:26.510
back into show history and another way

264

00:05:26.510  -->  00:05:26.520

265

00:05:26.520  -->  00:05:29.900
you can visualize this is all but let's

266

00:05:29.900  -->  00:05:29.910

267

00:05:29.910  -->  00:05:31.700
look at rails. Let's put it back to the

268

00:05:31.700  -->  00:05:31.710

269

00:05:31.710  -->  00:05:35.210
start and let's look at trails so this

270

00:05:35.210  -->  00:05:35.220

271

00:05:35.220  -->  00:05:37.220
is where trails a bit more applicable I

272

00:05:37.220  -->  00:05:37.230

273

00:05:37.230  -->  00:05:38.870
think because they take up less space

274

00:05:38.870  -->  00:05:38.880

275

00:05:38.880  -->  00:05:41.930
and looks like a painting. Looks like a

276

00:05:41.930  -->  00:05:41.940

277

00:05:41.940  -->  00:05:45.530
drawing and that's also pretty exciting

278

00:05:45.530  -->  00:05:45.540

279

00:05:45.540  -->  00:05:48.770
and finally what you might want to do is

280

00:05:48.770  -->  00:05:48.780

281

00:05:48.780  -->  00:05:51.530
let's say you go into trails and you

282

00:05:51.530  -->  00:05:51.540

283

00:05:51.540  -->  00:05:55.520
want to look at only the last five. For

284

00:05:55.520  -->  00:05:55.530

285

00:05:55.530  -->  00:05:58.550
all, but only show the last five and what

286

00:05:58.550  -->  00:05:58.560

287

00:05:58.560  -->  00:06:00.380
that will do is a liver like a trail

288

00:06:00.380  -->  00:06:00.390

289

00:06:00.390  -->  00:06:03.650
behind your circle so it's like it's

290

00:06:03.650  -->  00:06:03.660

291

00:06:03.660  -->  00:06:05.510
moving around in time with you.

292

00:06:05.510  -->  00:06:05.520

293

00:06:05.520  -->  00:06:08.540
In fact you can also change that to

294

00:06:08.540  -->  00:06:08.550

295

00:06:08.550  -->  00:06:12.710
trails rather than trails marks last

296

00:06:12.710  -->  00:06:12.720

297

00:06:12.720  -->  00:06:15.980
five and all. So this one it looks like

298

00:06:15.980  -->  00:06:15.990

299

00:06:15.990  -->  00:06:19.910
they're flying through space that that

300

00:06:19.910  -->  00:06:19.920

301

00:06:19.920  -->  00:06:22.010
also looks nice and once again all

302

00:06:22.010  -->  00:06:22.020

303

00:06:22.020  -->  00:06:23.420
depends on the type of visualization

304

00:06:23.420  -->  00:06:23.430

305

00:06:23.430  -->  00:06:25.160
creating and what you want to achieve.

306

00:06:25.160  -->  00:06:25.170

307

00:06:25.170  -->  00:06:27.590
Here you can look at the last five years

308

00:06:27.590  -->  00:06:27.600

309

00:06:27.600  -->  00:06:29.330
apart from only looking nice it also

310

00:06:29.330  -->  00:06:29.340

311

00:06:29.340  -->  00:06:31.190
shows you kind of the rate so here you

312

00:06:31.190  -->  00:06:31.200

313

00:06:31.200  -->  00:06:32.600
can see that this country is moving very

314

00:06:32.600  -->  00:06:32.610

315

00:06:32.610  -->  00:06:35.540
quickly. This country is moving slowly so

316

00:06:35.540  -->  00:06:35.550

317

00:06:35.550  -->  00:06:36.940
this is India.

318

00:06:36.940  -->  00:06:36.950

319

00:06:36.950  -->  00:06:39.280
This country is moving a bit faster so

320

00:06:39.280  -->  00:06:39.290

321

00:06:39.290  -->  00:06:41.410
it also shows you the rate and you can

322

00:06:41.410  -->  00:06:41.420

323

00:06:41.420  -->  00:06:43.510
gather information for the last five

324

00:06:43.510  -->  00:06:43.520

325

00:06:43.520  -->  00:06:45.610
years or you can change it to the number

326

00:06:45.610  -->  00:06:45.620

327

00:06:45.620  -->  00:06:48.730
of years that you would like and now for

328

00:06:48.730  -->  00:06:48.740

329

00:06:48.740  -->  00:06:50.230
completeness sake let's explore the

330

00:06:50.230  -->  00:06:50.240

331

00:06:50.240  -->  00:06:52.210
other two options that are available to

332

00:06:52.210  -->  00:06:52.220

333

00:06:52.220  -->  00:06:54.970
you. So if you go in here and you select

334

00:06:54.970  -->  00:06:54.980

335

00:06:54.980  -->  00:06:58.270
highlighted then it's like selected but

336

00:06:58.270  -->  00:06:58.280

337

00:06:58.280  -->  00:07:00.220
you don't have to be selected they can

338

00:07:00.220  -->  00:07:00.230

339

00:07:00.230  -->  00:07:01.840
be just highlighted and for instance

340

00:07:01.840  -->  00:07:01.850

341

00:07:01.850  -->  00:07:04.270
let's say I want to see how all the

342

00:07:04.270  -->  00:07:04.280

343

00:07:04.280  -->  00:07:05.740
countries in Latin America were

344

00:07:05.740  -->  00:07:05.750

345

00:07:05.750  -->  00:07:07.510
developing so I just click Latin America

346

00:07:07.510  -->  00:07:07.520

347

00:07:07.520  -->  00:07:10.360
the circles are not selected they're

348

00:07:10.360  -->  00:07:10.370

349

00:07:10.370  -->  00:07:12.910
just highlighted and yet i can see the

350

00:07:12.910  -->  00:07:12.920

351

00:07:12.920  -->  00:07:15.280
trail behind them so and the same thing

352

00:07:15.280  -->  00:07:15.290

353

00:07:15.290  -->  00:07:17.080
will happen in the course of the

354

00:07:17.080  -->  00:07:17.090

355

00:07:17.090  -->  00:07:18.940
animation or you can look at the middle

356

00:07:18.940  -->  00:07:18.950

357

00:07:18.950  -->  00:07:21.340
east countries in North America or South

358

00:07:21.340  -->  00:07:21.350

359

00:07:21.350  -->  00:07:24.400
Asia so that's what highlighted does and

360

00:07:24.400  -->  00:07:24.410

361

00:07:24.410  -->  00:07:25.870
the other one that you have here is

362

00:07:25.870  -->  00:07:25.880

363

00:07:25.880  -->  00:07:28.510
manual that allows you to manually

364

00:07:28.510  -->  00:07:28.520

365

00:07:28.520  -->  00:07:30.130
select what countries you want to

366

00:07:30.130  -->  00:07:30.140

367

00:07:30.140  -->  00:07:32.200
explore and let's say the researchers

368

00:07:32.200  -->  00:07:32.210

369

00:07:32.210  -->  00:07:34.510
are interested.

370

00:07:34.510  -->  00:07:34.520

371

00:07:34.520  -->  00:07:37.480
Let's put this into trails and let's put

372

00:07:37.480  -->  00:07:37.490

373

00:07:37.490  -->  00:07:40.510
all and let's say the researchers are

374

00:07:40.510  -->  00:07:40.520

375

00:07:40.520  -->  00:07:43.930
interested in looking at comparing China

376

00:07:43.930  -->  00:07:43.940

377

00:07:43.940  -->  00:07:47.560
and India and North America so they can

378

00:07:47.560  -->  00:07:47.570

379

00:07:47.570  -->  00:07:49.210
right-click select them right click

380

00:07:49.210  -->  00:07:49.220

381

00:07:49.220  -->  00:07:51.610
click page history and click always show

382

00:07:51.610  -->  00:07:51.620

383

00:07:51.620  -->  00:07:53.800
and that's a manual selection for page

384

00:07:53.800  -->  00:07:53.810

385

00:07:53.810  -->  00:07:56.170
history and now when you play you will

386

00:07:56.170  -->  00:07:56.180

387

00:07:56.180  -->  00:07:58.300
see that only these three countries have

388

00:07:58.300  -->  00:07:58.310

389

00:07:58.310  -->  00:08:00.190
their trails being displayed. So you can

390

00:08:00.190  -->  00:08:00.200

391

00:08:00.200  -->  00:08:02.170
visually compare them how they were

392

00:08:02.170  -->  00:08:02.180

393

00:08:02.180  -->  00:08:04.330
progressing. So they as you can see they

394

00:08:04.330  -->  00:08:04.340

395

00:08:04.340  -->  00:08:07.510
all had different pathways to get where

396

00:08:07.510  -->  00:08:07.520

397

00:08:07.520  -->  00:08:09.670
they were going

398

00:08:09.670  -->  00:08:09.680

399

00:08:09.680  -->  00:08:11.140
so there we go, that's how all of them

400

00:08:11.140  -->  00:08:11.150

401

00:08:11.150  -->  00:08:13.180
work. Personally I think for this

402

00:08:13.180  -->  00:08:13.190

403

00:08:13.190  -->  00:08:14.980
visualization, the best approach is

404

00:08:14.980  -->  00:08:14.990

405

00:08:14.990  -->  00:08:18.430
marks all but only for the selected

406

00:08:18.430  -->  00:08:18.440

407

00:08:18.440  -->  00:08:21.880
country so that researchers can drill

408

00:08:21.880  -->  00:08:21.890

409

00:08:21.890  -->  00:08:24.310
into that country by itself and once

410

00:08:24.310  -->  00:08:24.320

411

00:08:24.320  -->  00:08:26.500
again as you can see these have been

412

00:08:26.500  -->  00:08:26.510

413

00:08:26.510  -->  00:08:29.170
left so I need to control a, select all

414

00:08:29.170  -->  00:08:29.180

415

00:08:29.180  -->  00:08:32.320
right click page history and just click

416

00:08:32.320  -->  00:08:32.330

417

00:08:32.330  -->  00:08:35.260
automatic and that way when I unselect

418

00:08:35.260  -->  00:08:35.270

419

00:08:35.270  -->  00:08:37.330
they're gone and only the countries that

420

00:08:37.330  -->  00:08:37.340

421

00:08:37.340  -->  00:08:40.750
I will select will have their history

422

00:08:40.750  -->  00:08:40.760

423

00:08:40.760  -->  00:08:43.180
displayed. So there you go, that's how you

424

00:08:43.180  -->  00:08:43.190

425

00:08:43.190  -->  00:08:44.920
create advanced animation in Tableau. In

426

00:08:44.920  -->  00:08:44.930

427

00:08:44.930  -->  00:08:46.570
the next tutorial, we will put all of

428

00:08:46.570  -->  00:08:46.580

429

00:08:46.580  -->  00:08:48.430
this into a beautiful dashboard to

430

00:08:48.430  -->  00:08:48.440

431

00:08:48.440  -->  00:08:49.530
present to our

432

00:08:49.530  -->  00:08:49.540

433

00:08:49.540  -->  00:08:51.269
audience. I look forward to your next time and

434

00:08:51.269  -->  00:08:51.279

435

00:08:51.279  -->  00:08:57.720
until then, happy analyzing.
