00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:06,470
Hello and welcome back to the advanced

2

00:00:06,470  -->  00:00:06,480

3

00:00:06,480  -->  00:00:08,450
course in Tableau. We've already discussed

4

00:00:08,450  -->  00:00:08,460

5

00:00:08,460  -->  00:00:10,879
two out of the three types of the LOD

6

00:00:10,879  -->  00:00:10,889

7

00:00:10,889  -->  00:00:12,799
calculations, we've talked about the

8

00:00:12,799  -->  00:00:12,809

9

00:00:12,809  -->  00:00:16,099
include type and the exclude type and

10

00:00:16,099  -->  00:00:16,109

11

00:00:16,109  -->  00:00:18,470
we've only got the fixed type left but

12

00:00:18,470  -->  00:00:18,480

13

00:00:18,480  -->  00:00:20,000
before we proceed I'd like to quickly

14

00:00:20,000  -->  00:00:20,010

15

00:00:20,010  -->  00:00:23,120
recap on what we've learned so far and

16

00:00:23,120  -->  00:00:23,130

17

00:00:23,130  -->  00:00:26,359
also discuss again what we will learn

18

00:00:26,359  -->  00:00:26,369

19

00:00:26,369  -->  00:00:27,950
today. Just so that we're on the right

20

00:00:27,950  -->  00:00:27,960

21

00:00:27,960  -->  00:00:30,109
track and that we don't get lost.

22

00:00:30,109  -->  00:00:30,119

23

00:00:30,119  -->  00:00:33,110
Alright so we talked about the include

24

00:00:33,110  -->  00:00:33,120

25

00:00:33,120  -->  00:00:35,690
level of detail calculation and what we

26

00:00:35,690  -->  00:00:35,700

27

00:00:35,700  -->  00:00:37,069
did is we started at the level of

28

00:00:37,069  -->  00:00:37,079

29

00:00:37,079  -->  00:00:39,260
granularity of state. Once again, it

30

00:00:39,260  -->  00:00:39,270

31

00:00:39,270  -->  00:00:41,450
doesn't have to be geographical data or

32

00:00:41,450  -->  00:00:41,460

33

00:00:41,460  -->  00:00:43,400
geographical dimensions it can be any

34

00:00:43,400  -->  00:00:43,410

35

00:00:43,410  -->  00:00:45,170
type of dimensions but in our case they

36

00:00:45,170  -->  00:00:45,180

37

00:00:45,180  -->  00:00:47,990
are geographical so we started at the

38

00:00:47,990  -->  00:00:48,000

39

00:00:48,000  -->  00:00:49,940
level of state so this was our

40

00:00:49,940  -->  00:00:49,950

41

00:00:49,950  -->  00:00:53,630
visualization and then we included a new

42

00:00:53,630  -->  00:00:53,640

43

00:00:53,640  -->  00:00:56,330
dimension which was city. We went down to

44

00:00:56,330  -->  00:00:56,340

45

00:00:56,340  -->  00:00:59,029
a more granular level what we did here

46

00:00:59,029  -->  00:00:59,039

47

00:00:59,039  -->  00:01:03,020
is we aggregated our orders or actually

48

00:01:03,020  -->  00:01:03,030

49

00:01:03,030  -->  00:01:06,530
aggregated our items in our orders for

50

00:01:06,530  -->  00:01:06,540

51

00:01:06,540  -->  00:01:09,500
every city so here would sum up all the

52

00:01:09,500  -->  00:01:09,510

53

00:01:09,510  -->  00:01:11,390
profit for this city, sum up all the

54

00:01:11,390  -->  00:01:11,400

55

00:01:11,400  -->  00:01:13,370
profit for this city, for this city, for

56

00:01:13,370  -->  00:01:13,380

57

00:01:13,380  -->  00:01:15,380
this city so we'd find the profit for

58

00:01:15,380  -->  00:01:15,390

59

00:01:15,390  -->  00:01:17,810
every single city then we would take

60

00:01:17,810  -->  00:01:17,820

61

00:01:17,820  -->  00:01:20,539
those sums of profits that we've attributed

62

00:01:20,539  -->  00:01:20,549

63

00:01:20,549  -->  00:01:24,260
to every city and we would bring that

64

00:01:24,260  -->  00:01:24,270

65

00:01:24,270  -->  00:01:27,800
value back into our visualization and

66

00:01:27,800  -->  00:01:27,810

67

00:01:27,810  -->  00:01:29,359
what we would do if it is we would take

68

00:01:29,359  -->  00:01:29,369

69

00:01:29,369  -->  00:01:31,249
the average remember because you have

70

00:01:31,249  -->  00:01:31,259

71

00:01:31,259  -->  00:01:33,560
once you're going to a more to a less

72

00:01:33,560  -->  00:01:33,570

73

00:01:33,570  -->  00:01:35,719
granular level two more aggregate level

74

00:01:35,719  -->  00:01:35,729

75

00:01:35,729  -->  00:01:38,630
you have to aggregate the measures that

76

00:01:38,630  -->  00:01:38,640

77

00:01:38,640  -->  00:01:40,700
you have created so we've created a

78

00:01:40,700  -->  00:01:40,710

79

00:01:40,710  -->  00:01:42,530
measure which is the sum of profit for

80

00:01:42,530  -->  00:01:42,540

81

00:01:42,540  -->  00:01:44,899
every city but now we're talking about

82

00:01:44,899  -->  00:01:44,909

83

00:01:44,909  -->  00:01:47,060
things at the level of state so what we

84

00:01:47,060  -->  00:01:47,070

85

00:01:47,070  -->  00:01:49,670
did is we took the average of the city

86

00:01:49,670  -->  00:01:49,680

87

00:01:49,680  -->  00:01:52,850
profits for every single state so that's

88

00:01:52,850  -->  00:01:52,860

89

00:01:52,860  -->  00:01:55,550
how we use that level of detail include

90

00:01:55,550  -->  00:01:55,560

91

00:01:55,560  -->  00:01:58,280
in our visualization. Next we used

92

00:01:58,280  -->  00:01:58,290

93

00:01:58,290  -->  00:02:01,100
exclude and what we did is we created a

94

00:02:01,100  -->  00:02:01,110

95

00:02:01,110  -->  00:02:03,859
visualization at the city level and we

96

00:02:03,859  -->  00:02:03,869

97

00:02:03,869  -->  00:02:08,059
needed to get the a value from a

98

00:02:08,059  -->  00:02:08,069

99

00:02:08,069  -->  00:02:10,699
higher level of aggregation so what we

100

00:02:10,699  -->  00:02:10,709

101

00:02:10,709  -->  00:02:12,739
did is we used exclude and we excluded

102

00:02:12,739  -->  00:02:12,749

103

00:02:12,749  -->  00:02:14,869
city and that brought us in the

104

00:02:14,869  -->  00:02:14,879

105

00:02:14,879  -->  00:02:16,129
background again, our visualization

106

00:02:16,129  -->  00:02:16,139

107

00:02:16,139  -->  00:02:17,569
didn't change in the background and

108

00:02:17,569  -->  00:02:17,579

109

00:02:17,579  -->  00:02:19,610
brought us to the level of granularity

110

00:02:19,610  -->  00:02:19,620

111

00:02:19,620  -->  00:02:23,179
of state from here we quickly grabbed

112

00:02:23,179  -->  00:02:23,189

113

00:02:23,189  -->  00:02:25,879
the profit for every single state and

114

00:02:25,879  -->  00:02:25,889

115

00:02:25,889  -->  00:02:28,699
brought it back to our city and here in

116

00:02:28,699  -->  00:02:28,709

117

00:02:28,709  -->  00:02:30,619
this arrow we don't need to we do we

118

00:02:30,619  -->  00:02:30,629

119

00:02:30,629  -->  00:02:32,629
still need to aggregate but we don't

120

00:02:32,629  -->  00:02:32,639

121

00:02:32,639  -->  00:02:34,220
need to apply some more average or

122

00:02:34,220  -->  00:02:34,230

123

00:02:34,230  -->  00:02:35,629
anything because we're actually bringing

124

00:02:35,629  -->  00:02:35,639

125

00:02:35,639  -->  00:02:38,720
a measure, measure from a higher level of

126

00:02:38,720  -->  00:02:38,730

127

00:02:38,730  -->  00:02:41,209
aggregation so from the state level so

128

00:02:41,209  -->  00:02:41,219

129

00:02:41,219  -->  00:02:43,429
that's where the ATTR function came into

130

00:02:43,429  -->  00:02:43,439

131

00:02:43,439  -->  00:02:45,709
play and that way we were able to bring

132

00:02:45,709  -->  00:02:45,719

133

00:02:45,719  -->  00:02:49,250
down the profit for the states to the

134

00:02:49,250  -->  00:02:49,260

135

00:02:49,260  -->  00:02:51,649
level of the city and then we use that

136

00:02:51,649  -->  00:02:51,659

137

00:02:51,659  -->  00:02:55,729
in the calculation of what proportion or

138

00:02:55,729  -->  00:02:55,739

139

00:02:55,739  -->  00:02:58,339
what portion of profit does each city

140

00:02:58,339  -->  00:02:58,349

141

00:02:58,349  -->  00:03:00,890
contribute to its state and we create

142

00:03:00,890  -->  00:03:00,900

143

00:03:00,900  -->  00:03:02,420
that very powerful visualization that we

144

00:03:02,420  -->  00:03:02,430

145

00:03:02,430  -->  00:03:06,679
have now and finally the lost type of

146

00:03:06,679  -->  00:03:06,689

147

00:03:06,689  -->  00:03:08,089
level of detail calculation we still

148

00:03:08,089  -->  00:03:08,099

149

00:03:08,099  -->  00:03:10,670
have to discuss is the fixed type of

150

00:03:10,670  -->  00:03:10,680

151

00:03:10,680  -->  00:03:13,999
calculation and what it does here is we

152

00:03:13,999  -->  00:03:14,009

153

00:03:14,009  -->  00:03:17,270
set our aggregation that we want to work

154

00:03:17,270  -->  00:03:17,280

155

00:03:17,280  -->  00:03:21,800
with as an absolute. So think of that

156

00:03:21,800  -->  00:03:21,810

157

00:03:21,810  -->  00:03:24,439
little hack that we talked about with

158

00:03:24,439  -->  00:03:24,449

159

00:03:24,449  -->  00:03:26,990
relative and absolute pathways on a hard

160

00:03:26,990  -->  00:03:27,000

161

00:03:27,000  -->  00:03:29,420
drive so the include and exclude they're

162

00:03:29,420  -->  00:03:29,430

163

00:03:29,430  -->  00:03:32,179
like relative pathways, you have, you have

164

00:03:32,179  -->  00:03:32,189

165

00:03:32,189  -->  00:03:34,429
your starting point in your ID exclude

166

00:03:34,429  -->  00:03:34,439

167

00:03:34,439  -->  00:03:36,530
something so you go to a high level of

168

00:03:36,530  -->  00:03:36,540

169

00:03:36,540  -->  00:03:38,990
aggregation or you include stuff so you

170

00:03:38,990  -->  00:03:39,000

171

00:03:39,000  -->  00:03:41,330
go to a lower of all level of

172

00:03:41,330  -->  00:03:41,340

173

00:03:41,340  -->  00:03:44,330
aggregation but the fixed level of

174

00:03:44,330  -->  00:03:44,340

175

00:03:44,340  -->  00:03:46,099
detail calculation what it does is it

176

00:03:46,099  -->  00:03:46,109

177

00:03:46,109  -->  00:03:48,439
doesn't mind or doesn't take into

178

00:03:48,439  -->  00:03:48,449

179

00:03:48,449  -->  00:03:51,229
account of inspiration where you are

180

00:03:51,229  -->  00:03:51,239

181

00:03:51,239  -->  00:03:53,990
starting doesn't take that experience so

182

00:03:53,990  -->  00:03:54,000

183

00:03:54,000  -->  00:03:56,059
you could start at the country level at

184

00:03:56,059  -->  00:03:56,069

185

00:03:56,069  -->  00:03:57,439
the city level you can start at the

186

00:03:57,439  -->  00:03:57,449

187

00:03:57,449  -->  00:03:59,599
state level doesn't matter. What we'll do

188

00:03:59,599  -->  00:03:59,609

189

00:03:59,609  -->  00:04:03,469
is always take your absolute

190

00:04:03,469  -->  00:04:03,479

191

00:04:03,479  -->  00:04:06,770
specified level of detail and from there

192

00:04:06,770  -->  00:04:06,780

193

00:04:06,780  -->  00:04:08,119
perform the calculation and all

194

00:04:08,119  -->  00:04:08,129

195

00:04:08,129  -->  00:04:10,279
bring the same result to your

196

00:04:10,279  -->  00:04:10,289

197

00:04:10,289  -->  00:04:13,099
visualization regardless of where you're

198

00:04:13,099  -->  00:04:13,109

199

00:04:13,109  -->  00:04:16,699
starting from. So that's our quick recap

200

00:04:16,699  -->  00:04:16,709

201

00:04:16,709  -->  00:04:19,039
and the fixed level of detail

202

00:04:19,039  -->  00:04:19,049

203

00:04:19,049  -->  00:04:20,400
calculation is what we're

204

00:04:20,400  -->  00:04:20,410

205

00:04:20,410  -->  00:04:21,930
going to discuss today, so let's dive straight

206

00:04:21,930  -->  00:04:21,940

207

00:04:21,940  -->  00:04:24,510
into it. Alright so what we're going to

208

00:04:24,510  -->  00:04:24,520

209

00:04:24,520  -->  00:04:27,180
do is we're going to actually recreate

210

00:04:27,180  -->  00:04:27,190

211

00:04:27,190  -->  00:04:30,840
the level of detail calculations that we

212

00:04:30,840  -->  00:04:30,850

213

00:04:30,850  -->  00:04:32,970
have created but this time we're going

214

00:04:32,970  -->  00:04:32,980

215

00:04:32,980  -->  00:04:35,760
to use fixed and the reason for that is

216

00:04:35,760  -->  00:04:35,770

217

00:04:35,770  -->  00:04:37,380
because our visualizations is pretty much

218

00:04:37,380  -->  00:04:37,390

219

00:04:37,390  -->  00:04:39,090
ready all we have to do is we just need

220

00:04:39,090  -->  00:04:39,100

221

00:04:39,100  -->  00:04:41,550
to take this chart and this chart and

222

00:04:41,550  -->  00:04:41,560

223

00:04:41,560  -->  00:04:43,350
overlay them but we'll do that further

224

00:04:43,350  -->  00:04:43,360

225

00:04:43,360  -->  00:04:45,360
down in this section. For now we're just

226

00:04:45,360  -->  00:04:45,370

227

00:04:45,370  -->  00:04:47,910
going to learn and practice how to use a

228

00:04:47,910  -->  00:04:47,920

229

00:04:47,920  -->  00:04:50,520
fixed level of detail calculation and

230

00:04:50,520  -->  00:04:50,530

231

00:04:50,530  -->  00:04:52,380
we're just going to create the same

232

00:04:52,380  -->  00:04:52,390

233

00:04:52,390  -->  00:04:55,230
chart but with fixed and then this chart

234

00:04:55,230  -->  00:04:55,240

235

00:04:55,240  -->  00:04:57,090
as well hopefully if we have enough time.

236

00:04:57,090  -->  00:04:57,100

237

00:04:57,100  -->  00:04:59,820
So let's quickly duplicate this sheet

238

00:04:59,820  -->  00:04:59,830

239

00:04:59,830  -->  00:05:03,030
and bring it over here, there we go

240

00:05:03,030  -->  00:05:03,040

241

00:05:03,040  -->  00:05:06,510
and so we're going to say LOD fixed

242

00:05:06,510  -->  00:05:06,520

243

00:05:06,520  -->  00:05:09,150
and then we'll say a and here we're

244

00:05:09,150  -->  00:05:09,160

245

00:05:09,160  -->  00:05:11,520
going to just duplicate LOD include

246

00:05:11,520  -->  00:05:11,530

247

00:05:11,530  -->  00:05:13,950
going to duplicate this and we're going

248

00:05:13,950  -->  00:05:13,960

249

00:05:13,960  -->  00:05:19,080
to edit it and here we'll say LOD. This

250

00:05:19,080  -->  00:05:19,090

251

00:05:19,090  -->  00:05:21,750
is why I included this word the key word

252

00:05:21,750  -->  00:05:21,760

253

00:05:21,760  -->  00:05:23,370
here so that we can quickly change it

254

00:05:23,370  -->  00:05:23,380

255

00:05:23,380  -->  00:05:26,550
and here I'm going to say fixed and

256

00:05:26,550  -->  00:05:26,560

257

00:05:26,560  -->  00:05:28,740
instead of so let's just let's just

258

00:05:28,740  -->  00:05:28,750

259

00:05:28,750  -->  00:05:30,690
think this through, what we're doing is

260

00:05:30,690  -->  00:05:30,700

261

00:05:30,700  -->  00:05:33,060
we're we're applying into this this

262

00:05:33,060  -->  00:05:33,070

263

00:05:33,070  -->  00:05:35,790
chart only and we're ready in this chart

264

00:05:35,790  -->  00:05:35,800

265

00:05:35,800  -->  00:05:38,400
when we open up we have 1, 2 dimensions, we

266

00:05:38,400  -->  00:05:38,410

267

00:05:38,410  -->  00:05:40,440
don't have any other dimensions so we're

268

00:05:40,440  -->  00:05:40,450

269

00:05:40,450  -->  00:05:42,540
saying take these two dimensions and add

270

00:05:42,540  -->  00:05:42,550

271

00:05:42,550  -->  00:05:45,360
the dimension city to these dimensions

272

00:05:45,360  -->  00:05:45,370

273

00:05:45,370  -->  00:05:47,940
and then perform the calculations at

274

00:05:47,940  -->  00:05:47,950

275

00:05:47,950  -->  00:05:50,220
that level. So basically it's a take city

276

00:05:50,220  -->  00:05:50,230

277

00:05:50,230  -->  00:05:52,020
add it here and then perform the

278

00:05:52,020  -->  00:05:52,030

279

00:05:52,030  -->  00:05:54,270
calculations and then bring the result

280

00:05:54,270  -->  00:05:54,280

281

00:05:54,280  -->  00:05:57,450
back here. So let's just quickly bring

282

00:05:57,450  -->  00:05:57,460

283

00:05:57,460  -->  00:05:59,850
city again in here so once city is added

284

00:05:59,850  -->  00:05:59,860

285

00:05:59,860  -->  00:06:02,130
right how many dimensions we have? We

286

00:06:02,130  -->  00:06:02,140

287

00:06:02,140  -->  00:06:03,630
have country, state, city. We have three

288

00:06:03,630  -->  00:06:03,640

289

00:06:03,640  -->  00:06:05,850
dimensions so those are exactly the

290

00:06:05,850  -->  00:06:05,860

291

00:06:05,860  -->  00:06:07,890
three dimensions that we need to specify

292

00:06:07,890  -->  00:06:07,900

293

00:06:07,900  -->  00:06:09,450
here so that's what we're going to say

294

00:06:09,450  -->  00:06:09,460

295

00:06:09,460  -->  00:06:12,120
we're going to say country and then

296

00:06:12,120  -->  00:06:12,130

297

00:06:12,130  -->  00:06:14,850
we're going to say state we're going to

298

00:06:14,850  -->  00:06:14,860

299

00:06:14,860  -->  00:06:19,260
say city and we're going to click ok so

300

00:06:19,260  -->  00:06:19,270

301

00:06:19,270  -->  00:06:21,390
let's just take this out from here and

302

00:06:21,390  -->  00:06:21,400

303

00:06:21,400  -->  00:06:24,390
if LOD fix and instead of include

304

00:06:24,390  -->  00:06:24,400

305

00:06:24,400  -->  00:06:26,730
this time we're going to say fixed right so

306

00:06:26,730  -->  00:06:26,740

307

00:06:26,740  -->  00:06:28,920
because previously we already had

308

00:06:28,920  -->  00:06:28,930

309

00:06:28,930  -->  00:06:30,930
country and state we only needed to add

310

00:06:30,930  -->  00:06:30,940

311

00:06:30,940  -->  00:06:33,510
city but now because we're saying fixed

312

00:06:33,510  -->  00:06:33,520

313

00:06:33,520  -->  00:06:35,460
we don't have a relative pathway where

314

00:06:35,460  -->  00:06:35,470

315

00:06:35,470  -->  00:06:38,010
we have to specify the absolute pathway

316

00:06:38,010  -->  00:06:38,020

317

00:06:38,020  -->  00:06:41,610
in those terms that we discussed but

318

00:06:41,610  -->  00:06:41,620

319

00:06:41,620  -->  00:06:43,350
in Tableau terms we just have to specify

320

00:06:43,350  -->  00:06:43,360

321

00:06:43,360  -->  00:06:46,380
all the dimensions that we want in our

322

00:06:46,380  -->  00:06:46,390

323

00:06:46,390  -->  00:06:48,779
aggregation that's going to happen in

324

00:06:48,779  -->  00:06:48,789

325

00:06:48,789  -->  00:06:50,279
this aggregation is going to happen we

326

00:06:50,279  -->  00:06:50,289

327

00:06:50,289  -->  00:06:52,140
want to specify at which level of

328

00:06:52,140  -->  00:06:52,150

329

00:06:52,150  -->  00:06:53,700
dimensions it should happen.

330

00:06:53,700  -->  00:06:53,710

331

00:06:53,710  -->  00:06:56,820
There we go LOD fixed, click ok, LOD

332

00:06:56,820  -->  00:06:56,830

333

00:06:56,830  -->  00:06:58,770
fixed and now I'm just going to replace

334

00:06:58,770  -->  00:06:58,780

335

00:06:58,780  -->  00:07:00,930
it here.

336

00:07:00,930  -->  00:07:00,940

337

00:07:00,940  -->  00:07:02,430
Of course we need an aggregation, we're

338

00:07:02,430  -->  00:07:02,440

339

00:07:02,440  -->  00:07:05,790
going to say measure average and just

340

00:07:05,790  -->  00:07:05,800

341

00:07:05,800  -->  00:07:08,370
replace it here to hold down control so

342

00:07:08,370  -->  00:07:08,380

343

00:07:08,380  -->  00:07:09,900
there's our new result

344

00:07:09,900  -->  00:07:09,910

345

00:07:09,910  -->  00:07:11,790
let's compare it to our old result, as you can

346

00:07:11,790  -->  00:07:11,800

347

00:07:11,800  -->  00:07:16,140
see same exact result and moreover now

348

00:07:16,140  -->  00:07:16,150

349

00:07:16,150  -->  00:07:18,480
if something changes with our

350

00:07:18,480  -->  00:07:18,490

351

00:07:18,490  -->  00:07:23,130
visualization the result won't change so

352

00:07:23,130  -->  00:07:23,140

353

00:07:23,140  -->  00:07:25,650
the this calculation will still be

354

00:07:25,650  -->  00:07:25,660

355

00:07:25,660  -->  00:07:27,360
performed so if I for instance take

356

00:07:27,360  -->  00:07:27,370

357

00:07:27,370  -->  00:07:30,090
state out you know we're seeing

358

00:07:30,090  -->  00:07:30,100

359

00:07:30,100  -->  00:07:34,920
307.8 here that is the average

360

00:07:34,920  -->  00:07:34,930

361

00:07:34,930  -->  00:07:37,290
this this calculation is still being

362

00:07:37,290  -->  00:07:37,300

363

00:07:37,300  -->  00:07:41,310
performed so if I click LOD fixed right

364

00:07:41,310  -->  00:07:41,320

365

00:07:41,320  -->  00:07:43,800
edit the calculation this is the average

366

00:07:43,800  -->  00:07:43,810

367

00:07:43,810  -->  00:07:48,150
that is applied to this calculation so

368

00:07:48,150  -->  00:07:48,160

369

00:07:48,160  -->  00:07:50,520
the sum of profit is still calculated at

370

00:07:50,520  -->  00:07:50,530

371

00:07:50,530  -->  00:07:53,070
the city level and then the average is

372

00:07:53,070  -->  00:07:53,080

373

00:07:53,080  -->  00:07:54,990
applied and you can make sure to confirm

374

00:07:54,990  -->  00:07:55,000

375

00:07:55,000  -->  00:07:57,330
that is true by just going to the second

376

00:07:57,330  -->  00:07:57,340

377

00:07:57,340  -->  00:08:00,210
chart and if I remove state here you'll

378

00:08:00,210  -->  00:08:00,220

379

00:08:00,220  -->  00:08:03,570
see that the average here is 35.42.

380

00:08:03,570  -->  00:08:03,580

381

00:08:03,580  -->  00:08:06,840
35.42 probably what I'll do is just make

382

00:08:06,840  -->  00:08:06,850

383

00:08:06,850  -->  00:08:10,770
this label much bigger so that we can or

384

00:08:10,770  -->  00:08:10,780

385

00:08:10,780  -->  00:08:13,680
maybe make it white that should be

386

00:08:13,680  -->  00:08:13,690

387

00:08:13,690  -->  00:08:17,400
better to see so 35.42 is the average

388

00:08:17,400  -->  00:08:17,410

389

00:08:17,410  -->  00:08:22,830
across all items that were sold ever in

390

00:08:22,830  -->  00:08:22,840

391

00:08:22,840  -->  00:08:25,589
any state any city, any postal code

392

00:08:25,589  -->  00:08:25,599

393

00:08:25,599  -->  00:08:29,219
across any time from, whereas 307.8 is

394

00:08:29,219  -->  00:08:29,229

395

00:08:29,229  -->  00:08:31,770
the average in the US across all the

396

00:08:31,770  -->  00:08:31,780

397

00:08:31,780  -->  00:08:34,620
cities right so that you can see that

398

00:08:34,620  -->  00:08:34,630

399

00:08:34,630  -->  00:08:38,250
this works. It works fine, even though our

400

00:08:38,250  -->  00:08:38,260

401

00:08:38,260  -->  00:08:40,350
aggregation has changed.

402

00:08:40,350  -->  00:08:40,360

403

00:08:40,360  -->  00:08:42,930
Ok so that's just return that back to

404

00:08:42,930  -->  00:08:42,940

405

00:08:42,940  -->  00:08:46,470
where it was. Ok so that's LOD fixed a and

406

00:08:46,470  -->  00:08:46,480

407

00:08:46,480  -->  00:08:48,360
now we're going to recreate this more

408

00:08:48,360  -->  00:08:48,370

409

00:08:48,370  -->  00:08:50,040
difficult one.

410

00:08:50,040  -->  00:08:50,050

411

00:08:50,050  -->  00:08:53,310
Let's duplicate sheet and here let's

412

00:08:53,310  -->  00:08:53,320

413

00:08:53,320  -->  00:08:55,319
start with this year we'll put it here

414

00:08:55,319  -->  00:08:55,329

415

00:08:55,329  -->  00:09:00,449
to say fixed be, right so let's see what

416

00:09:00,449  -->  00:09:00,459

417

00:09:00,459  -->  00:09:02,430
do we need to recreate, it's actually not

418

00:09:02,430  -->  00:09:02,440

419

00:09:02,440  -->  00:09:03,690
that difficult,

420

00:09:03,690  -->  00:09:03,700

421

00:09:03,700  -->  00:09:05,970
what we need to recreate is just as LOD

422

00:09:05,970  -->  00:09:05,980

423

00:09:05,980  -->  00:09:08,220
exclude say profit and then we're going

424

00:09:08,220  -->  00:09:08,230

425

00:09:08,230  -->  00:09:10,350
to have to replace it in these measures

426

00:09:10,350  -->  00:09:10,360

427

00:09:10,360  -->  00:09:13,650
ok so I'm going to duplicate LOD exclude

428

00:09:13,650  -->  00:09:13,660

429

00:09:13,660  -->  00:09:18,360
and I'm going to rename it, I'm going to

430

00:09:18,360  -->  00:09:18,370

431

00:09:18,370  -->  00:09:19,020
edit it,

432

00:09:19,020  -->  00:09:19,030

433

00:09:19,030  -->  00:09:21,840
alright so this is what do we want? We

434

00:09:21,840  -->  00:09:21,850

435

00:09:21,850  -->  00:09:24,329
want, once we exclude city and postal

436

00:09:24,329  -->  00:09:24,339

437

00:09:24,339  -->  00:09:27,360
code, what we'll have is country and say we

438

00:09:27,360  -->  00:09:27,370

439

00:09:27,370  -->  00:09:28,620
don't even need to look at the

440

00:09:28,620  -->  00:09:28,630

441

00:09:28,630  -->  00:09:30,480
visualization. All we need to look at

442

00:09:30,480  -->  00:09:30,490

443

00:09:30,490  -->  00:09:32,850
and count and register is the

444

00:09:32,850  -->  00:09:32,860

445

00:09:32,860  -->  00:09:34,920
dimensions that we have, so we have

446

00:09:34,920  -->  00:09:34,930

447

00:09:34,930  -->  00:09:36,930
country and state just two dimensions

448

00:09:36,930  -->  00:09:36,940

449

00:09:36,940  -->  00:09:39,300
that's what we'll have official city and

450

00:09:39,300  -->  00:09:39,310

451

00:09:39,310  -->  00:09:41,699
postal code are excluded so that's

452

00:09:41,699  -->  00:09:41,709

453

00:09:41,709  -->  00:09:43,890
exactly what we're going to do and let's

454

00:09:43,890  -->  00:09:43,900

455

00:09:43,900  -->  00:09:45,689
change it up here, so here we're going to

456

00:09:45,689  -->  00:09:45,699

457

00:09:45,699  -->  00:09:48,300
say fixed and here I'm going to say

458

00:09:48,300  -->  00:09:48,310

459

00:09:48,310  -->  00:09:51,990
fixed as well but now this is not what I

460

00:09:51,990  -->  00:09:52,000

461

00:09:52,000  -->  00:09:54,150
want to exclude this is actually a level

462

00:09:54,150  -->  00:09:54,160

463

00:09:54,160  -->  00:09:56,579
of detail which I want to perform the

464

00:09:56,579  -->  00:09:56,589

465

00:09:56,589  -->  00:09:59,460
calculation so fixed this is going to be

466

00:09:59,460  -->  00:09:59,470

467

00:09:59,470  -->  00:10:02,310
country and this is going to be state so

468

00:10:02,310  -->  00:10:02,320

469

00:10:02,320  -->  00:10:03,750
I'm specifying exactly the same to that

470

00:10:03,750  -->  00:10:03,760

471

00:10:03,760  -->  00:10:06,449
we have here and that's the calculation

472

00:10:06,449  -->  00:10:06,459

473

00:10:06,459  -->  00:10:08,100
one perform. So I'm just going to return

474

00:10:08,100  -->  00:10:08,110

475

00:10:08,110  -->  00:10:09,780
everything back to normal,

476

00:10:09,780  -->  00:10:09,790

477

00:10:09,790  -->  00:10:12,780
city but now this is our LOD fixed, going

478

00:10:12,780  -->  00:10:12,790

479

00:10:12,790  -->  00:10:14,880
to click ok. Alright so there it is,

480

00:10:14,880  -->  00:10:14,890

481

00:10:14,890  -->  00:10:17,069
LOD fixed a state profit that's the

482

00:10:17,069  -->  00:10:17,079

483

00:10:17,079  -->  00:10:18,990
one we're going to be using so we're at

484

00:10:18,990  -->  00:10:19,000

485

00:10:19,000  -->  00:10:20,670
the city level we're going to the state

486

00:10:20,670  -->  00:10:20,680

487

00:10:20,680  -->  00:10:24,180
level and let's just rename this so we

488

00:10:24,180  -->  00:10:24,190

489

00:10:24,190  -->  00:10:27,630
can copy the name and let's apply it

490

00:10:27,630  -->  00:10:27,640

491

00:10:27,640  -->  00:10:29,220
everywhere so we're just going to double

492

00:10:29,220  -->  00:10:29,230

493

00:10:29,230  -->  00:10:32,280
click here and in this case it's used

494

00:10:32,280  -->  00:10:32,290

495

00:10:32,290  -->  00:10:34,949
twice in this calculation so we're going

496

00:10:34,949  -->  00:10:34,959

497

00:10:34,959  -->  00:10:37,590
to put it here and we're going to put it

498

00:10:37,590  -->  00:10:37,600

499

00:10:37,600  -->  00:10:40,470
here just as a press ENTER just check

500

00:10:40,470  -->  00:10:40,480

501

00:10:40,480  -->  00:10:42,480
the map that nothing changes nothing

502

00:10:42,480  -->  00:10:42,490

503

00:10:42,490  -->  00:10:44,730
change that's good, then again

504

00:10:44,730  -->  00:10:44,740

505

00:10:44,740  -->  00:10:46,380
double-click here,

506

00:10:46,380  -->  00:10:46,390

507

00:10:46,390  -->  00:10:48,249
there we go

508

00:10:48,249  -->  00:10:48,259

509

00:10:48,259  -->  00:10:50,650
this and this one is only used once

510

00:10:50,650  -->  00:10:50,660

511

00:10:50,660  -->  00:10:53,079
again nothing changed in the map some

512

00:10:53,079  -->  00:10:53,089

513

00:10:53,089  -->  00:10:56,710
profit stays LOD exclude let's change

514

00:10:56,710  -->  00:10:56,720

515

00:10:56,720  -->  00:11:01,449
this, okay.

516

00:11:01,449  -->  00:11:01,459

517

00:11:01,459  -->  00:11:03,849
Again nothing changed and finally this

518

00:11:03,849  -->  00:11:03,859

519

00:11:03,859  -->  00:11:06,340
one. Let's look

520

00:11:06,340  -->  00:11:06,350

521

00:11:06,350  -->  00:11:10,239
yep it's only used once, alright did

522

00:11:10,239  -->  00:11:10,249

523

00:11:10,249  -->  00:11:12,009
something changed nothing changed good

524

00:11:12,009  -->  00:11:12,019

525

00:11:12,019  -->  00:11:16,269
and now basically even if we add the

526

00:11:16,269  -->  00:11:16,279

527

00:11:16,279  -->  00:11:20,049
postal code it will still work as

528

00:11:20,049  -->  00:11:20,059

529

00:11:20,059  -->  00:11:22,719
expected it works totally fine.

530

00:11:22,719  -->  00:11:22,729

531

00:11:22,729  -->  00:11:24,129
So there we go we have successfully

532

00:11:24,129  -->  00:11:24,139

533

00:11:24,139  -->  00:11:29,769
replaced LOD include and exclude with

534

00:11:29,769  -->  00:11:29,779

535

00:11:29,779  -->  00:11:31,719
LOD fixed as you can see you can

536

00:11:31,719  -->  00:11:31,729

537

00:11:31,729  -->  00:11:33,429
achieve the exactly same results you

538

00:11:33,429  -->  00:11:33,439

539

00:11:33,439  -->  00:11:36,729
just specifying explicitly we're at

540

00:11:36,729  -->  00:11:36,739

541

00:11:36,739  -->  00:11:38,499
which level of granularity you want your

542

00:11:38,499  -->  00:11:38,509

543

00:11:38,509  -->  00:11:40,449
calculations to be performed and I hope

544

00:11:40,449  -->  00:11:40,459

545

00:11:40,459  -->  00:11:41,919
you enjoyed this tutorial I look forward

546

00:11:41,919  -->  00:11:41,929

547

00:11:41,929  -->  00:11:43,359
to seeing you next time and until then,

548

00:11:43,359  -->  00:11:43,369

549

00:11:43,369  -->  00:11:49,569
happy analyzing!
