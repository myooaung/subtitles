00:00:03.170  -->  00:00:06.970
Welcome back to the advanced course on

2

00:00:06.970  -->  00:00:06.980

3

00:00:06.980  -->  00:00:09.879
Tableau and today we will be putting all

4

00:00:09.879  -->  00:00:09.889

5

00:00:09.889  -->  00:00:12.850
our findings into a beautiful story line

6

00:00:12.850  -->  00:00:12.860

7

00:00:12.860  -->  00:00:15.700
to present to the executive stakeholders

8

00:00:15.700  -->  00:00:15.710

9

00:00:15.710  -->  00:00:17.350
of the company.

10

00:00:17.350  -->  00:00:17.360

11

00:00:17.360  -->  00:00:19.660
Alright so here we've got our findings

12

00:00:19.660  -->  00:00:19.670

13

00:00:19.670  -->  00:00:21.250
in front of us this is the main chart

14

00:00:21.250  -->  00:00:21.260

15

00:00:21.260  -->  00:00:23.050
that we've been working with. How do we

16

00:00:23.050  -->  00:00:23.060

17

00:00:23.060  -->  00:00:26.349
put it into a storyline? To start off,

18

00:00:26.349  -->  00:00:26.359

19

00:00:26.359  -->  00:00:28.300
with let's create that storyline that

20

00:00:28.300  -->  00:00:28.310

21

00:00:28.310  -->  00:00:31.090
will be placing everything into there we

22

00:00:31.090  -->  00:00:31.100

23

00:00:31.100  -->  00:00:32.619
go so that will be our storyline now

24

00:00:32.619  -->  00:00:32.629

25

00:00:32.629  -->  00:00:35.770
let's set a specific height and width

26

00:00:35.770  -->  00:00:35.780

27

00:00:35.780  -->  00:00:37.660
for the storyline. I'm going to set a

28

00:00:37.660  -->  00:00:37.670

29

00:00:37.670  -->  00:00:42.880
thousand width and a 700 height,

30

00:00:42.880  -->  00:00:42.890

31

00:00:42.890  -->  00:00:45.880
ok that's good! You can choose from

32

00:00:45.880  -->  00:00:45.890

33

00:00:45.890  -->  00:00:48.610
dropdowns here based on where you'll be

34

00:00:48.610  -->  00:00:48.620

35

00:00:48.620  -->  00:00:50.259
presenting or how your audience will be

36

00:00:50.259  -->  00:00:50.269

37

00:00:50.269  -->  00:00:52.509
viewing a storyline. I personally

38

00:00:52.509  -->  00:00:52.519

39

00:00:52.519  -->  00:00:54.640
selected this one because it is like the

40

00:00:54.640  -->  00:00:54.650

41

00:00:54.650  -->  00:00:57.310
desktop but it is a bit smaller in terms

42

00:00:57.310  -->  00:00:57.320

43

00:00:57.320  -->  00:00:58.869
of hieight because we don't we won't be

44

00:00:58.869  -->  00:00:58.879

45

00:00:58.879  -->  00:01:00.399
needing all of that hard for the

46

00:01:00.399  -->  00:01:00.409

47

00:01:00.409  -->  00:01:01.689
specific storyline.

48

00:01:01.689  -->  00:01:01.699

49

00:01:01.699  -->  00:01:05.320
Ok so what do we want to put in here?

50

00:01:05.320  -->  00:01:05.330

51

00:01:05.330  -->  00:01:08.740
Well we already have our analysis and

52

00:01:08.740  -->  00:01:08.750

53

00:01:08.750  -->  00:01:09.969
I'm just going to make this a bit

54

00:01:09.969  -->  00:01:09.979

55

00:01:09.979  -->  00:01:12.880
smaller so it's easier, a very

56

00:01:12.880  -->  00:01:12.890

57

00:01:12.890  -->  00:01:15.310
important step is that we're going to be

58

00:01:15.310  -->  00:01:15.320

59

00:01:15.320  -->  00:01:16.749
using this chart quite a lot and we

60

00:01:16.749  -->  00:01:16.759

61

00:01:16.759  -->  00:01:19.660
won't just have it by itself we will use

62

00:01:19.660  -->  00:01:19.670

63

00:01:19.670  -->  00:01:22.029
different subsets of this chart. We'll

64

00:01:22.029  -->  00:01:22.039

65

00:01:22.039  -->  00:01:23.800
look at the separate machines by

66

00:01:23.800  -->  00:01:23.810

67

00:01:23.810  -->  00:01:25.539
themselves that's our plan for the

68

00:01:25.539  -->  00:01:25.549

69

00:01:25.549  -->  00:01:28.359
storyline. We want to start our storyline

70

00:01:28.359  -->  00:01:28.369

71

00:01:28.369  -->  00:01:30.429
with an overall summary and then we want

72

00:01:30.429  -->  00:01:30.439

73

00:01:30.439  -->  00:01:32.080
to talk about every single machine that

74

00:01:32.080  -->  00:01:32.090

75

00:01:32.090  -->  00:01:35.980
we analyzed and give advice or insight

76

00:01:35.980  -->  00:01:35.990

77

00:01:35.990  -->  00:01:39.849
into each one of these charts. So that

78

00:01:39.849  -->  00:01:39.859

79

00:01:39.859  -->  00:01:40.989
means we'll be using this chart quite a

80

00:01:40.989  -->  00:01:40.999

81

00:01:40.999  -->  00:01:43.300
lot and therefore we have to make sure

82

00:01:43.300  -->  00:01:43.310

83

00:01:43.310  -->  00:01:46.330
is formatted really well at the very

84

00:01:46.330  -->  00:01:46.340

85

00:01:46.340  -->  00:01:48.340
start so we won't have to reformat it.

86

00:01:48.340  -->  00:01:48.350

87

00:01:48.350  -->  00:01:50.440
Let's go ahead and do that. So let's

88

00:01:50.440  -->  00:01:50.450

89

00:01:50.450  -->  00:01:52.510
start from the top left this label

90

00:01:52.510  -->  00:01:52.520

91

00:01:52.520  -->  00:01:55.059
machine is not required let's hide label.

92

00:01:55.059  -->  00:01:55.069

93

00:01:55.069  -->  00:01:57.609
Now this is required for now for the

94

00:01:57.609  -->  00:01:57.619

95

00:01:57.619  -->  00:01:59.260
overall summary but it won't be required

96

00:01:59.260  -->  00:01:59.270

97

00:01:59.270  -->  00:02:01.749
for each individual machine so we'll

98

00:02:01.749  -->  00:02:01.759

99

00:02:01.759  -->  00:02:05.980
take care of that later. Next this axis

100

00:02:05.980  -->  00:02:05.990

101

00:02:05.990  -->  00:02:08.020
here, we need to format it and change it

102

00:02:08.020  -->  00:02:08.030

103

00:02:08.030  -->  00:02:12.830
to a percentage so let's change it to

104

00:02:12.830  -->  00:02:12.840

105

00:02:12.840  -->  00:02:15.290
a percentage like that now we don't need

106

00:02:15.290  -->  00:02:15.300

107

00:02:15.300  -->  00:02:16.970
the name of the axis because we know

108

00:02:16.970  -->  00:02:16.980

109

00:02:16.980  -->  00:02:18.410
what we're talking about there's only

110

00:02:18.410  -->  00:02:18.420

111

00:02:18.420  -->  00:02:20.540
one metric we're analyzing let's get rid

112

00:02:20.540  -->  00:02:20.550

113

00:02:20.550  -->  00:02:22.820
of the name. See that saves a bit of space

114

00:02:22.820  -->  00:02:22.830

115

00:02:22.830  -->  00:02:24.680
and we can move this over here you save

116

00:02:24.680  -->  00:02:24.690

117

00:02:24.690  -->  00:02:26.780
a bit more space. Now we don't need the

118

00:02:26.780  -->  00:02:26.790

119

00:02:26.790  -->  00:02:29.270
name of this axis because once again

120

00:02:29.270  -->  00:02:29.280

121

00:02:29.280  -->  00:02:33.140
it's obvious what it is. It's the date,

122

00:02:33.140  -->  00:02:33.150

123

00:02:33.150  -->  00:02:35.570
alright so there we go we've cleaned up

124

00:02:35.570  -->  00:02:35.580

125

00:02:35.580  -->  00:02:36.890
this chart a little bit. That's a good

126

00:02:36.890  -->  00:02:36.900

127

00:02:36.900  -->  00:02:37.850
start.

128

00:02:37.850  -->  00:02:37.860

129

00:02:37.860  -->  00:02:39.559
Next we want to do is also fix up this

130

00:02:39.559  -->  00:02:39.569

131

00:02:39.569  -->  00:02:43.160
axis and demonstrate marks, tick marks

132

00:02:43.160  -->  00:02:43.170

133

00:02:43.170  -->  00:02:46.490
for every day. So let's click every one

134

00:02:46.490  -->  00:02:46.500

135

00:02:46.500  -->  00:02:47.210
day

136

00:02:47.210  -->  00:02:47.220

137

00:02:47.220  -->  00:02:49.069
click OK and now you can see that we

138

00:02:49.069  -->  00:02:49.079

139

00:02:49.079  -->  00:02:51.770
have a line for every single day. Next

140

00:02:51.770  -->  00:02:51.780

141

00:02:51.780  -->  00:02:54.589
what you can see here is once you bring

142

00:02:54.589  -->  00:02:54.599

143

00:02:54.599  -->  00:02:59.059
up your mouse to any value there's a

144

00:02:59.059  -->  00:02:59.069

145

00:02:59.069  -->  00:03:00.860
tooltip so we want to fix up that

146

00:03:00.860  -->  00:03:00.870

147

00:03:00.870  -->  00:03:04.789
tooltip. We don't want to see this then

148

00:03:04.789  -->  00:03:04.799

149

00:03:04.799  -->  00:03:06.710
we don't want to see we do want to see

150

00:03:06.710  -->  00:03:06.720

151

00:03:06.720  -->  00:03:07.250
this

152

00:03:07.250  -->  00:03:07.260

153

00:03:07.260  -->  00:03:09.680
the date and the time but we just want

154

00:03:09.680  -->  00:03:09.690

155

00:03:09.690  -->  00:03:11.660
we might want to change the name and we

156

00:03:11.660  -->  00:03:11.670

157

00:03:11.670  -->  00:03:13.339
want to change in for this also

158

00:03:13.339  -->  00:03:13.349

159

00:03:13.349  -->  00:03:14.900
we don't want to see this control at all.

160

00:03:14.900  -->  00:03:14.910

161

00:03:14.910  -->  00:03:17.690
So let's go ahead and fix that up we're

162

00:03:17.690  -->  00:03:17.700

163

00:03:17.700  -->  00:03:20.000
going to go too far,

164

00:03:20.000  -->  00:03:20.010

165

00:03:20.010  -->  00:03:23.809
worksheet tooltip and in the tooltip

166

00:03:23.809  -->  00:03:23.819

167

00:03:23.819  -->  00:03:25.550
we're going to get rid of the top part

168

00:03:25.550  -->  00:03:25.560

169

00:03:25.560  -->  00:03:28.580
and we'll leave the bottom part will

170

00:03:28.580  -->  00:03:28.590

171

00:03:28.590  -->  00:03:30.830
create backspace and click tab one time

172

00:03:30.830  -->  00:03:30.840

173

00:03:30.840  -->  00:03:34.430
and then we will say idle capacity and

174

00:03:34.430  -->  00:03:34.440

175

00:03:34.440  -->  00:03:38.000
then will click backspace and click tab

176

00:03:38.000  -->  00:03:38.010

177

00:03:38.010  -->  00:03:38.780
on time

178

00:03:38.780  -->  00:03:38.790

179

00:03:38.790  -->  00:03:45.170
perhaps we'll say idle capacity 8 hour

180

00:03:45.170  -->  00:03:45.180

181

00:03:45.180  -->  00:03:50.839
moving average. Ok click ok, so now when

182

00:03:50.839  -->  00:03:50.849

183

00:03:50.849  -->  00:03:52.970
we bring it up you can see that the

184

00:03:52.970  -->  00:03:52.980

185

00:03:52.980  -->  00:03:54.229
tooltip is much better

186

00:03:54.229  -->  00:03:54.239

187

00:03:54.239  -->  00:03:55.490
the other thing is that if we click on

188

00:03:55.490  -->  00:03:55.500

189

00:03:55.500  -->  00:03:56.900
one by accident you can see another

190

00:03:56.900  -->  00:03:56.910

191

00:03:56.910  -->  00:03:58.640
trend line up here. If you select a

192

00:03:58.640  -->  00:03:58.650

193

00:03:58.650  -->  00:04:00.500
couple of them then a trendline will

194

00:04:00.500  -->  00:04:00.510

195

00:04:00.510  -->  00:04:02.720
appear just for those dots we don't want

196

00:04:02.720  -->  00:04:02.730

197

00:04:02.730  -->  00:04:04.430
that in this specific visualization so

198

00:04:04.430  -->  00:04:04.440

199

00:04:04.440  -->  00:04:07.280
let's go ahead and right click somewhere

200

00:04:07.280  -->  00:04:07.290

201

00:04:07.290  -->  00:04:09.559
on the chart and then go to trend lines

202

00:04:09.559  -->  00:04:09.569

203

00:04:09.569  -->  00:04:13.640
edit trend lines and uncheck this last

204

00:04:13.640  -->  00:04:13.650

205

00:04:13.650  -->  00:04:15.740
box show recalculated line.

206

00:04:15.740  -->  00:04:15.750

207

00:04:15.750  -->  00:04:17.449
Alright so what now when we click on

208

00:04:17.449  -->  00:04:17.459

209

00:04:17.459  -->  00:04:20.629
some charts on some dots we won't see

210

00:04:20.629  -->  00:04:20.639

211

00:04:20.639  -->  00:04:22.760
the line and once again we still want to

212

00:04:22.760  -->  00:04:22.770

213

00:04:22.770  -->  00:04:25.370
get rid of this control panel in our

214

00:04:25.370  -->  00:04:25.380

215

00:04:25.380  -->  00:04:26.210
tooltip.

216

00:04:26.210  -->  00:04:26.220

217

00:04:26.220  -->  00:04:28.430
So let's go ahead and do that worksheet

218

00:04:28.430  -->  00:04:28.440

219

00:04:28.440  -->  00:04:32.000
tooltip and here you've got a options

220

00:04:32.000  -->  00:04:32.010

221

00:04:32.010  -->  00:04:33.440
include command buttons

222

00:04:33.440  -->  00:04:33.450

223

00:04:33.450  -->  00:04:34.850
let's get rid of that because the user

224

00:04:34.850  -->  00:04:34.860

225

00:04:34.860  -->  00:04:37.010
doesn't need these command bottoms see

226

00:04:37.010  -->  00:04:37.020

227

00:04:37.020  -->  00:04:38.420
now they're not coming up anymore.

228

00:04:38.420  -->  00:04:38.430

229

00:04:38.430  -->  00:04:42.290
Ok that's a good start, alright so what

230

00:04:42.290  -->  00:04:42.300

231

00:04:42.300  -->  00:04:43.820
do we want? We want to put this in the storyline.

232

00:04:43.820  -->  00:04:43.830

233

00:04:43.830  -->  00:04:47.330
So let's change this and call this

234

00:04:47.330  -->  00:04:47.340

235

00:04:47.340  -->  00:04:49.940
report. Now let me show you an example of

236

00:04:49.940  -->  00:04:49.950

237

00:04:49.950  -->  00:04:51.560
how we can include this analysis

238

00:04:51.560  -->  00:04:51.570

239

00:04:51.570  -->  00:04:54.020
worksheet in our storyline. We can simply

240

00:04:54.020  -->  00:04:54.030

241

00:04:54.030  -->  00:04:56.060
just drag it in but then we don't have

242

00:04:56.060  -->  00:04:56.070

243

00:04:56.070  -->  00:04:57.920
control we don't have that much control

244

00:04:57.920  -->  00:04:57.930

245

00:04:57.930  -->  00:04:59.060
over it.

246

00:04:59.060  -->  00:04:59.070

247

00:04:59.070  -->  00:05:01.550
For instance I can't get rid of this

248

00:05:01.550  -->  00:05:01.560

249

00:05:01.560  -->  00:05:04.760
color legend its there and I can't

250

00:05:04.760  -->  00:05:04.770

251

00:05:04.770  -->  00:05:07.310
adjust things about this chart as easy

252

00:05:07.310  -->  00:05:07.320

253

00:05:07.320  -->  00:05:10.040
as I could in a dashboard and that's the

254

00:05:10.040  -->  00:05:10.050

255

00:05:10.050  -->  00:05:12.590
drawback of dragging just worksheets

256

00:05:12.590  -->  00:05:12.600

257

00:05:12.600  -->  00:05:14.450
into the storyline. You have much less

258

00:05:14.450  -->  00:05:14.460

259

00:05:14.460  -->  00:05:19.040
control. So we're going to cancel that so

260

00:05:19.040  -->  00:05:19.050

261

00:05:19.050  -->  00:05:22.100
just delete that basically and the

262

00:05:22.100  -->  00:05:22.110

263

00:05:22.110  -->  00:05:24.590
better way of putting sheets into your

264

00:05:24.590  -->  00:05:24.600

265

00:05:24.600  -->  00:05:26.750
storyline is to go through a dashboard

266

00:05:26.750  -->  00:05:26.760

267

00:05:26.760  -->  00:05:29.600
every single time and that way you will

268

00:05:29.600  -->  00:05:29.610

269

00:05:29.610  -->  00:05:32.300
have much more control of what is going

270

00:05:32.300  -->  00:05:32.310

271

00:05:32.310  -->  00:05:34.730
on. So let's create a dashboard and so

272

00:05:34.730  -->  00:05:34.740

273

00:05:34.740  -->  00:05:37.430
this one will call it analysis and we'll

274

00:05:37.430  -->  00:05:37.440

275

00:05:37.440  -->  00:05:39.800
just put a D at end saying dashboard so

276

00:05:39.800  -->  00:05:39.810

277

00:05:39.810  -->  00:05:43.040
there's analysis, there's analysis dashboard and

278

00:05:43.040  -->  00:05:43.050

279

00:05:43.050  -->  00:05:45.409
now we're going to take analysis and

280

00:05:45.409  -->  00:05:45.419

281

00:05:45.419  -->  00:05:48.260
we'll drag it in here. Now as you can see,

282

00:05:48.260  -->  00:05:48.270

283

00:05:48.270  -->  00:05:50.090
it's a bit big that's because my

284

00:05:50.090  -->  00:05:50.100

285

00:05:50.100  -->  00:05:52.310
dashboard is too big. I want to make it

286

00:05:52.310  -->  00:05:52.320

287

00:05:52.320  -->  00:05:57.020
smaller so here I'll say 900. What was our

288

00:05:57.020  -->  00:05:57.030

289

00:05:57.030  -->  00:05:58.940
height, our width here was a thousand so

290

00:05:58.940  -->  00:05:58.950

291

00:05:58.950  -->  00:06:01.190
here we're saying 900 which is which is

292

00:06:01.190  -->  00:06:01.200

293

00:06:01.200  -->  00:06:02.930
a reasonable so we'll have some matches

294

00:06:02.930  -->  00:06:02.940

295

00:06:02.940  -->  00:06:04.610
on the right on the left and here are

296

00:06:04.610  -->  00:06:04.620

297

00:06:04.620  -->  00:06:06.800
height was 700 here we're going to say

298

00:06:06.800  -->  00:06:06.810

299

00:06:06.810  -->  00:06:10.190
550 because we do have this bit at the

300

00:06:10.190  -->  00:06:10.200

301

00:06:10.200  -->  00:06:12.500
top which take some takes up some space.

302

00:06:12.500  -->  00:06:12.510

303

00:06:12.510  -->  00:06:16.550
So there we go, that's our dashboard and

304

00:06:16.550  -->  00:06:16.560

305

00:06:16.560  -->  00:06:20.360
now we can close that. We don't want that

306

00:06:20.360  -->  00:06:20.370

307

00:06:20.370  -->  00:06:22.550
color legend and also we don't want this

308

00:06:22.550  -->  00:06:22.560

309

00:06:22.560  -->  00:06:25.400
title over here, so let's get rid of the

310

00:06:25.400  -->  00:06:25.410

311

00:06:25.410  -->  00:06:26.180
title.

312

00:06:26.180  -->  00:06:26.190

313

00:06:26.190  -->  00:06:28.730
Ok so now we have this dashboard and

314

00:06:28.730  -->  00:06:28.740

315

00:06:28.740  -->  00:06:30.980
let's go ahead and drag it into our

316

00:06:30.980  -->  00:06:30.990

317

00:06:30.990  -->  00:06:34.250
storyline, so there you go that's

318

00:06:34.250  -->  00:06:34.260

319

00:06:34.260  -->  00:06:36.200
the start of your storyline you can make

320

00:06:36.200  -->  00:06:36.210

321

00:06:36.210  -->  00:06:37.400
some space as you can see there's

322

00:06:37.400  -->  00:06:37.410

323

00:06:37.410  -->  00:06:39.440
disappears because it's not fitting in.

324

00:06:39.440  -->  00:06:39.450

325

00:06:39.450  -->  00:06:39.830
Let's make

326

00:06:39.830  -->  00:06:39.840

327

00:06:39.840  -->  00:06:42.230
some space, there you go so that that

328

00:06:42.230  -->  00:06:42.240

329

00:06:42.240  -->  00:06:44.180
makes space and it fits perfectly into

330

00:06:44.180  -->  00:06:44.190

331

00:06:44.190  -->  00:06:46.580
my window right now.

332

00:06:46.580  -->  00:06:46.590

333

00:06:46.590  -->  00:06:51.500
Ok so this is going to be our first view

334

00:06:51.500  -->  00:06:51.510

335

00:06:51.510  -->  00:06:54.409
in the storyline or call it summary and

336

00:06:54.409  -->  00:06:54.419

337

00:06:54.419  -->  00:06:56.510
that's pretty much it so for the title

338

00:06:56.510  -->  00:06:56.520

339

00:06:56.520  -->  00:06:57.650
of the story

340

00:06:57.650  -->  00:06:57.660

341

00:06:57.660  -->  00:06:59.450
you definitely do want to tell the story

342

00:06:59.450  -->  00:06:59.460

343

00:06:59.460  -->  00:07:01.640
so let's double click that and change it.

344

00:07:01.640  -->  00:07:01.650

345

00:07:01.650  -->  00:07:03.770
I've got one prepared here Coal Terminal

346

00:07:03.770  -->  00:07:03.780

347

00:07:03.780  -->  00:07:06.770
Maintenance Analysis (Mock-Up) and I want

348

00:07:06.770  -->  00:07:06.780

349

00:07:06.780  -->  00:07:09.140
that centered. There we go so that's

350

00:07:09.140  -->  00:07:09.150

351

00:07:09.150  -->  00:07:10.850
going to be out title for the story.

352

00:07:10.850  -->  00:07:10.860

353

00:07:10.860  -->  00:07:13.040
Alright we've got the first slide in

354

00:07:13.040  -->  00:07:13.050

355

00:07:13.050  -->  00:07:15.140
here and it looks good. It's going to pop

356

00:07:15.140  -->  00:07:15.150

357

00:07:15.150  -->  00:07:20.780
up. It's got the labels over here and you

358

00:07:20.780  -->  00:07:20.790

359

00:07:20.790  -->  00:07:23.120
might want to change these but I'm just

360

00:07:23.120  -->  00:07:23.130

361

00:07:23.130  -->  00:07:24.379
going to yeah I'm actually going to

362

00:07:24.379  -->  00:07:24.389

363

00:07:24.389  -->  00:07:27.290
change them I'm going to go back to my

364

00:07:27.290  -->  00:07:27.300

365

00:07:27.300  -->  00:07:29.780
analysis over here and if you're right

366

00:07:29.780  -->  00:07:29.790

367

00:07:29.790  -->  00:07:31.940
click and click Edit alias you can

368

00:07:31.940  -->  00:07:31.950

369

00:07:31.950  -->  00:07:34.310
change it so I just wanted to be rl1

370

00:07:34.310  -->  00:07:34.320

371

00:07:34.320  -->  00:07:41.659
and I just want all of them to be rl1, rl2

372

00:07:41.659  -->  00:07:41.669

373

00:07:41.669  -->  00:07:44.000
so there we go I've just changed the

374

00:07:44.000  -->  00:07:44.010

375

00:07:44.010  -->  00:07:46.159
aliases for all of these. So they look

376

00:07:46.159  -->  00:07:46.169

377

00:07:46.169  -->  00:07:48.260
better in the storyline and I can make

378

00:07:48.260  -->  00:07:48.270

379

00:07:48.270  -->  00:07:51.440
some space here and as you can see that

380

00:07:51.440  -->  00:07:51.450

381

00:07:51.450  -->  00:07:53.029
makes it look better in the storyline.

382

00:07:53.029  -->  00:07:53.039

383

00:07:53.039  -->  00:07:55.010
Alright so one thing we did forget to do

384

00:07:55.010  -->  00:07:55.020

385

00:07:55.020  -->  00:07:58.310
is you see these large margins in the

386

00:07:58.310  -->  00:07:58.320

387

00:07:58.320  -->  00:07:59.900
chart that's a bit too much

388

00:07:59.900  -->  00:07:59.910

389

00:07:59.910  -->  00:08:02.180
so let's go ahead and go back to the

390

00:08:02.180  -->  00:08:02.190

391

00:08:02.190  -->  00:08:05.360
chart over here and we'll go to the axis,

392

00:08:05.360  -->  00:08:05.370

393

00:08:05.370  -->  00:08:07.820
edit axis and we'll say the fixed stars

394

00:08:07.820  -->  00:08:07.830

395

00:08:07.830  -->  00:08:10.219
should be the 30th of we should be the

396

00:08:10.219  -->  00:08:10.229

397

00:08:10.229  -->  00:08:12.980
31st and it gives it two days margin we

398

00:08:12.980  -->  00:08:12.990

399

00:08:12.990  -->  00:08:18.500
just want one day as my numbers so one

400

00:08:18.500  -->  00:08:18.510

401

00:08:18.510  -->  00:08:21.260
day margin is enough now it looks a bit

402

00:08:21.260  -->  00:08:21.270

403

00:08:21.270  -->  00:08:23.810
better bit wider so there we go that's a

404

00:08:23.810  -->  00:08:23.820

405

00:08:23.820  -->  00:08:25.520
good start to our dashboard. We've got

406

00:08:25.520  -->  00:08:25.530

407

00:08:25.530  -->  00:08:28.129
the first page ready let's create a new

408

00:08:28.129  -->  00:08:28.139

409

00:08:28.139  -->  00:08:31.250
page to a new blank point now into here we

410

00:08:31.250  -->  00:08:31.260

411

00:08:31.260  -->  00:08:33.140
also what we want to do is one start

412

00:08:33.140  -->  00:08:33.150

413

00:08:33.150  -->  00:08:34.610
talking about machines but before we do

414

00:08:34.610  -->  00:08:34.620

415

00:08:34.620  -->  00:08:38.089
we want to first talk about or have like

416

00:08:38.089  -->  00:08:38.099

417

00:08:38.099  -->  00:08:40.070
an introductory slide and we'll call

418

00:08:40.070  -->  00:08:40.080

419

00:08:40.080  -->  00:08:43.040
this one are reclaimers and we'll just

420

00:08:43.040  -->  00:08:43.050

421

00:08:43.050  -->  00:08:45.050
have a picture here at a top it'll still

422

00:08:45.050  -->  00:08:45.060

423

00:08:45.060  -->  00:08:47.690
be in some texture saying reclaimers

424

00:08:47.690  -->  00:08:47.700

425

00:08:47.700  -->  00:08:50.030
make a bold statement. So we want to

426

00:08:50.030  -->  00:08:50.040

427

00:08:50.040  -->  00:08:51.410
create another dashboard with just one

428

00:08:51.410  -->  00:08:51.420

429

00:08:51.420  -->  00:08:52.670
picture but

430

00:08:52.670  -->  00:08:52.680

431

00:08:52.680  -->  00:08:54.260
we can create new dashboard or we can

432

00:08:54.260  -->  00:08:54.270

433

00:08:54.270  -->  00:08:57.440
just copy this one, copy sheet because

434

00:08:57.440  -->  00:08:57.450

435

00:08:57.450  -->  00:08:59.690
it's already got the right width and

436

00:08:59.690  -->  00:08:59.700

437

00:08:59.700  -->  00:09:01.639
height for us actually we want to

438

00:09:01.639  -->  00:09:01.649

439

00:09:01.649  -->  00:09:04.130
duplicate sheet there we go

440

00:09:04.130  -->  00:09:04.140

441

00:09:04.140  -->  00:09:05.660
and this one we're going to call

442

00:09:05.660  -->  00:09:05.670

443

00:09:05.670  -->  00:09:09.139
reclaimers dashboard.

444

00:09:09.139  -->  00:09:09.149

445

00:09:09.149  -->  00:09:11.630
Alright so here what we want is we want

446

00:09:11.630  -->  00:09:11.640

447

00:09:11.640  -->  00:09:15.500
to get rid of the previous image of the

448

00:09:15.500  -->  00:09:15.510

449

00:09:15.510  -->  00:09:17.570
previous visualization and now we just

450

00:09:17.570  -->  00:09:17.580

451

00:09:17.580  -->  00:09:20.329
want to add some text and for the texts

452

00:09:20.329  -->  00:09:20.339

453

00:09:20.339  -->  00:09:22.400
were going to say reclaimers and make it

454

00:09:22.400  -->  00:09:22.410

455

00:09:22.410  -->  00:09:27.320
perhaps size 22 make it bold and keep it

456

00:09:27.320  -->  00:09:27.330

457

00:09:27.330  -->  00:09:29.960
great for now right click, click edit

458

00:09:29.960  -->  00:09:29.970

459

00:09:29.970  -->  00:09:33.860
actually click format and I want shading

460

00:09:33.860  -->  00:09:33.870

461

00:09:33.870  -->  00:09:37.370
this color. Now what I want is I want an

462

00:09:37.370  -->  00:09:37.380

463

00:09:37.380  -->  00:09:38.540
image underneath,

464

00:09:38.540  -->  00:09:38.550

465

00:09:38.550  -->  00:09:39.920
I've prepared some images you can get

466

00:09:39.920  -->  00:09:39.930

467

00:09:39.930  -->  00:09:42.320
them in the course materials folder or

468

00:09:42.320  -->  00:09:42.330

469

00:09:42.330  -->  00:09:45.199
actually on the course materials website

470

00:09:45.199  -->  00:09:45.209

471

00:09:45.209  -->  00:09:46.550
and I'm going to use this image for

472

00:09:46.550  -->  00:09:46.560

473

00:09:46.560  -->  00:09:48.769
reclaimer and now I'm going to

474

00:09:48.769  -->  00:09:48.779

475

00:09:48.779  -->  00:09:50.990
essentially image but I don't want to

476

00:09:50.990  -->  00:09:51.000

477

00:09:51.000  -->  00:09:54.650
fit the image now let's make some room

478

00:09:54.650  -->  00:09:54.660

479

00:09:54.660  -->  00:09:57.230
over here maybe that about that size

480

00:09:57.230  -->  00:09:57.240

481

00:09:57.240  -->  00:10:01.070
and right click, edit text, select all

482

00:10:01.070  -->  00:10:01.080

483

00:10:01.080  -->  00:10:03.920
make it white, center the text, click

484

00:10:03.920  -->  00:10:03.930

485

00:10:03.930  -->  00:10:06.949
okay. So that looks better and so that's

486

00:10:06.949  -->  00:10:06.959

487

00:10:06.959  -->  00:10:09.920
our reclaimers dashboard. We're going to

488

00:10:09.920  -->  00:10:09.930

489

00:10:09.930  -->  00:10:12.920
go to report and drag it into here.

490

00:10:12.920  -->  00:10:12.930

491

00:10:12.930  -->  00:10:14.180
Alright so once you're reading through a

492

00:10:14.180  -->  00:10:14.190

493

00:10:14.190  -->  00:10:15.650
story you see the summary and then

494

00:10:15.650  -->  00:10:15.660

495

00:10:15.660  -->  00:10:16.850
you're like okay so now we're going to

496

00:10:16.850  -->  00:10:16.860

497

00:10:16.860  -->  00:10:19.519
talk about the reclaimers. Great, so now

498

00:10:19.519  -->  00:10:19.529

499

00:10:19.529  -->  00:10:21.949
we want a new blank point and here we want

500

00:10:21.949  -->  00:10:21.959

501

00:10:21.959  -->  00:10:23.240
to start talking about the first

502

00:10:23.240  -->  00:10:23.250

503

00:10:23.250  -->  00:10:26.060
reclaimer so in order to start talking

504

00:10:26.060  -->  00:10:26.070

505

00:10:26.070  -->  00:10:27.500
about the first reclaimer we want to

506

00:10:27.500  -->  00:10:27.510

507

00:10:27.510  -->  00:10:30.530
have this sheet but at the top so at the

508

00:10:30.530  -->  00:10:30.540

509

00:10:30.540  -->  00:10:32.960
top here we want to have the name of

510

00:10:32.960  -->  00:10:32.970

511

00:10:32.970  -->  00:10:35.449
what we're talking about then we want to

512

00:10:35.449  -->  00:10:35.459

513

00:10:35.459  -->  00:10:38.390
have a chart so that the chart for that

514

00:10:38.390  -->  00:10:38.400

515

00:10:38.400  -->  00:10:40.400
reclaimer then some text and maybe

516

00:10:40.400  -->  00:10:40.410

517

00:10:40.410  -->  00:10:42.050
something else so let's get started on

518

00:10:42.050  -->  00:10:42.060

519

00:10:42.060  -->  00:10:43.850
that. I'm going to duplicate this because

520

00:10:43.850  -->  00:10:43.860

521

00:10:43.860  -->  00:10:46.280
I wanted to keep the width of the height

522

00:10:46.280  -->  00:10:46.290

523

00:10:46.290  -->  00:10:50.030
of this specific text bar. I'm going to

524

00:10:50.030  -->  00:10:50.040

525

00:10:50.040  -->  00:10:52.699
go ahead and duplicate sheet and this

526

00:10:52.699  -->  00:10:52.709

527

00:10:52.709  -->  00:10:56.600
one I'm going to call  RL 1 and D

528

00:10:56.600  -->  00:10:56.610

529

00:10:56.610  -->  00:10:58.730
because it's the dashboard for rl1.

530

00:10:58.730  -->  00:10:58.740

531

00:10:58.740  -->  00:11:01.490
Of course I'm going to get rid of this,

532

00:11:01.490  -->  00:11:01.500

533

00:11:01.500  -->  00:11:02.630
well actually I'm just going to keep it

534

00:11:02.630  -->  00:11:02.640

535

00:11:02.640  -->  00:11:04.830
there for now so that size doesn't

536

00:11:04.830  -->  00:11:04.840

537

00:11:04.840  -->  00:11:08.910
change and now in here I want to the

538

00:11:08.910  -->  00:11:08.920

539

00:11:08.920  -->  00:11:11.370
analysis tab but of course I want to

540

00:11:11.370  -->  00:11:11.380

541

00:11:11.380  -->  00:11:14.610
first duplicate this tab so that then I

542

00:11:14.610  -->  00:11:14.620

543

00:11:14.620  -->  00:11:16.800
can just leave it leave the machine that

544

00:11:16.800  -->  00:11:16.810

545

00:11:16.810  -->  00:11:20.010
I need so I'm going to duplicate sheet

546

00:11:20.010  -->  00:11:20.020

547

00:11:20.020  -->  00:11:27.330
and here I'm going to call it RL1 so

548

00:11:27.330  -->  00:11:27.340

549

00:11:27.340  -->  00:11:32.730
maybe analysis rl1 and I'm going to take

550

00:11:32.730  -->  00:11:32.740

551

00:11:32.740  -->  00:11:34.530
machine and put into filter and I'm

552

00:11:34.530  -->  00:11:34.540

553

00:11:34.540  -->  00:11:38.010
going to select non on leave rl1. As

554

00:11:38.010  -->  00:11:38.020

555

00:11:38.020  -->  00:11:39.870
you can see there is our chart and the

556

00:11:39.870  -->  00:11:39.880

557

00:11:39.880  -->  00:11:41.460
table calculations haven't been affected

558

00:11:41.460  -->  00:11:41.470

559

00:11:41.470  -->  00:11:43.590
by applying at all just got rid of

560

00:11:43.590  -->  00:11:43.600

561

00:11:43.600  -->  00:11:46.260
everything that we don't need. Alright

562

00:11:46.260  -->  00:11:46.270

563

00:11:46.270  -->  00:11:48.630
that's a good start, so what do I want I

564

00:11:48.630  -->  00:11:48.640

565

00:11:48.640  -->  00:11:52.710
want this in my dashboard so in this

566

00:11:52.710  -->  00:11:52.720

567

00:11:52.720  -->  00:11:55.050
dashboard instead of this picture so

568

00:11:55.050  -->  00:11:55.060

569

00:11:55.060  -->  00:11:58.200
analysis rl1 there we go we can get rid

570

00:11:58.200  -->  00:11:58.210

571

00:11:58.210  -->  00:12:00.840
of that ok that's a good start now I

572

00:12:00.840  -->  00:12:00.850

573

00:12:00.850  -->  00:12:03.480
want some text under it right,

574

00:12:03.480  -->  00:12:03.490

575

00:12:03.490  -->  00:12:05.400
I've actually already prepared the text

576

00:12:05.400  -->  00:12:05.410

577

00:12:05.410  -->  00:12:09.330
it does take a while to type it up but

578

00:12:09.330  -->  00:12:09.340

579

00:12:09.340  -->  00:12:14.700
nevertheless there's our texts so and

580

00:12:14.700  -->  00:12:14.710

581

00:12:14.710  -->  00:12:18.750
what else do I want? I want this text to

582

00:12:18.750  -->  00:12:18.760

583

00:12:18.760  -->  00:12:22.050
be aligned towards the top

584

00:12:22.050  -->  00:12:22.060

585

00:12:22.060  -->  00:12:26.700
ok so that's our texts now it does look

586

00:12:26.700  -->  00:12:26.710

587

00:12:26.710  -->  00:12:29.430
a bit empty with just a text I don't

588

00:12:29.430  -->  00:12:29.440

589

00:12:29.440  -->  00:12:30.840
need this filter so I'm going to rid of

590

00:12:30.840  -->  00:12:30.850

591

00:12:30.850  -->  00:12:33.450
it just looks still a bit empty so if I

592

00:12:33.450  -->  00:12:33.460

593

00:12:33.460  -->  00:12:35.970
just included in the report now you'll

594

00:12:35.970  -->  00:12:35.980

595

00:12:35.980  -->  00:12:37.920
see what I mean you can see like

596

00:12:37.920  -->  00:12:37.930

597

00:12:37.930  -->  00:12:40.260
something's missing right, something

598

00:12:40.260  -->  00:12:40.270

599

00:12:40.270  -->  00:12:42.540
is missing. So let's put something in

600

00:12:42.540  -->  00:12:42.550

601

00:12:42.550  -->  00:12:44.910
here let's put an image, I'm going to put

602

00:12:44.910  -->  00:12:44.920

603

00:12:44.920  -->  00:12:47.850
it to the left and I'm going to use a

604

00:12:47.850  -->  00:12:47.860

605

00:12:47.860  -->  00:12:50.550
map so the map of our stock yard and I'm

606

00:12:50.550  -->  00:12:50.560

607

00:12:50.560  -->  00:12:53.220
going to tell the user where exactly is

608

00:12:53.220  -->  00:12:53.230

609

00:12:53.230  -->  00:12:55.980
located, is this machine located I'm

610

00:12:55.980  -->  00:12:55.990

611

00:12:55.990  -->  00:12:57.510
going to point to it actually I don't need

612

00:12:57.510  -->  00:12:57.520

613

00:12:57.520  -->  00:12:59.130
this. As you can see it's taking up space

614

00:12:59.130  -->  00:12:59.140

615

00:12:59.140  -->  00:13:00.750
we already know we're talking about rl1

616

00:13:00.750  -->  00:13:00.760

617

00:13:00.760  -->  00:13:04.050
so let's

618

00:13:04.050  -->  00:13:04.060

619

00:13:04.060  -->  00:13:06.840
get rid of the header and then let's hide

620

00:13:06.840  -->  00:13:06.850

621

00:13:06.850  -->  00:13:09.300
title and let's change the reclaimers to

622

00:13:09.300  -->  00:13:09.310

623

00:13:09.310  -->  00:13:14.400
RL1. Now what

624

00:13:14.400  -->  00:13:14.410

625

00:13:14.410  -->  00:13:23.010
or actually let's call it reclaimer one.

626

00:13:23.010  -->  00:13:23.020

627

00:13:23.020  -->  00:13:26.700
Okay so there we go now what I want to

628

00:13:26.700  -->  00:13:26.710

629

00:13:26.710  -->  00:13:28.830
do is I want to show the user exactly

630

00:13:28.830  -->  00:13:28.840

631

00:13:28.840  -->  00:13:30.030
which one we're talking about and by the

632

00:13:30.030  -->  00:13:30.040

633

00:13:30.040  -->  00:13:33.990
way here we want to want to fit image so

634

00:13:33.990  -->  00:13:34.000

635

00:13:34.000  -->  00:13:36.780
it fits nicely. So we can see all them

636

00:13:36.780  -->  00:13:36.790

637

00:13:36.790  -->  00:13:38.700
all right so I want to show the user

638

00:13:38.700  -->  00:13:38.710

639

00:13:38.710  -->  00:13:41.820
which one we're actually talking about

640

00:13:41.820  -->  00:13:41.830

641

00:13:41.830  -->  00:13:45.510
exactly here and we're talking about RL1

642

00:13:45.510  -->  00:13:45.520

643

00:13:45.520  -->  00:13:47.160
so how am I going to do that? I can add another

644

00:13:47.160  -->  00:13:47.170

645

00:13:47.170  -->  00:13:49.440
image with a circle but i'll show you a

646

00:13:49.440  -->  00:13:49.450

647

00:13:49.450  -->  00:13:52.440
quick handy trick here if you add text

648

00:13:52.440  -->  00:13:52.450

649

00:13:52.450  -->  00:13:54.540
right so if you first click floating and

650

00:13:54.540  -->  00:13:54.550

651

00:13:54.550  -->  00:13:56.280
you add text will be floating text and

652

00:13:56.280  -->  00:13:56.290

653

00:13:56.290  -->  00:14:00.810
if you click O and then in your font

654

00:14:00.810  -->  00:14:00.820

655

00:14:00.820  -->  00:14:04.530
you select Century Gothic so where is

656

00:14:04.530  -->  00:14:04.540

657

00:14:04.540  -->  00:14:05.610
it?

658

00:14:05.610  -->  00:14:05.620

659

00:14:05.620  -->  00:14:09.240
Century Gothic it makes all very round

660

00:14:09.240  -->  00:14:09.250

661

00:14:09.250  -->  00:14:12.120
like a circle and then for size we're

662

00:14:12.120  -->  00:14:12.130

663

00:14:12.130  -->  00:14:14.460
going to say something like maybe like

664

00:14:14.460  -->  00:14:14.470

665

00:14:14.470  -->  00:14:18.360
size 60 and of course we want to make it

666

00:14:18.360  -->  00:14:18.370

667

00:14:18.370  -->  00:14:19.170
red

668

00:14:19.170  -->  00:14:19.180

669

00:14:19.180  -->  00:14:23.400
so let me highlight it and make it red

670

00:14:23.400  -->  00:14:23.410

671

00:14:23.410  -->  00:14:26.790
maybe that red not not that red so

672

00:14:26.790  -->  00:14:26.800

673

00:14:26.800  -->  00:14:28.500
where's the red there that red.

674

00:14:28.500  -->  00:14:28.510

675

00:14:28.510  -->  00:14:33.900
Ok so now I can highlight rl1 and on the

676

00:14:33.900  -->  00:14:33.910

677

00:14:33.910  -->  00:14:35.550
dashboard it looks like we actually

678

00:14:35.550  -->  00:14:35.560

679

00:14:35.560  -->  00:14:38.490
highlighted it and now I can include

680

00:14:38.490  -->  00:14:38.500

681

00:14:38.500  -->  00:14:41.070
this in my report,

682

00:14:41.070  -->  00:14:41.080

683

00:14:41.080  -->  00:14:42.570
so I'm going, alright sorry there, there

684

00:14:42.570  -->  00:14:42.580

685

00:14:42.580  -->  00:14:44.910
we go so once you go

686

00:14:44.910  -->  00:14:44.920

687

00:14:44.920  -->  00:14:47.550
to the storyline you can see the

688

00:14:47.550  -->  00:14:47.560

689

00:14:47.560  -->  00:14:49.530
overall summary and maybe you can talk

690

00:14:49.530  -->  00:14:49.540

691

00:14:49.540  -->  00:14:50.670
about everything here and there will be

692

00:14:50.670  -->  00:14:50.680

693

00:14:50.680  -->  00:14:53.040
enough but if the viewers for instance

694

00:14:53.040  -->  00:14:53.050

695

00:14:53.050  -->  00:14:56.100
are viewing it on Tableau  server and they

696

00:14:56.100  -->  00:14:56.110

697

00:14:56.110  -->  00:14:58.080
want to read through your analysis then

698

00:14:58.080  -->  00:14:58.090

699

00:14:58.090  -->  00:14:59.700
they'll it'll be like a powerpoint

700

00:14:59.700  -->  00:14:59.710

701

00:14:59.710  -->  00:15:01.800
basically for them they all go ok

702

00:15:01.800  -->  00:15:01.810

703

00:15:01.810  -->  00:15:04.440
summary reclaimers ok and here we're

704

00:15:04.440  -->  00:15:04.450

705

00:15:04.450  -->  00:15:08.340
going to say rl1 and then they already

706

00:15:08.340  -->  00:15:08.350

707

00:15:08.350  -->  00:15:11.520
get it, get into the analysis of rl1 the

708

00:15:11.520  -->  00:15:11.530

709

00:15:11.530  -->  00:15:13.650
image above illustrates 8-hour moving

710

00:15:13.650  -->  00:15:13.660

711

00:15:13.660  -->  00:15:15.930
average of vital capacity and so on so

712

00:15:15.930  -->  00:15:15.940

713

00:15:15.940  -->  00:15:17.670
you basically specify what

714

00:15:17.670  -->  00:15:17.680

715

00:15:17.680  -->  00:15:20.370
exactly you saw in this chart and what

716

00:15:20.370  -->  00:15:20.380

717

00:15:20.380  -->  00:15:23.550
the conclusion for this specific machine

718

00:15:23.550  -->  00:15:23.560

719

00:15:23.560  -->  00:15:26.430
is. So there we go, we've done one out of

720

00:15:26.430  -->  00:15:26.440

721

00:15:26.440  -->  00:15:28.410
the five machines four more to go

722

00:15:28.410  -->  00:15:28.420

723

00:15:28.420  -->  00:15:30.120
and in order to save time I'm going to

724

00:15:30.120  -->  00:15:30.130

725

00:15:30.130  -->  00:15:31.950
end this tutorial here and I will leave

726

00:15:31.950  -->  00:15:31.960

727

00:15:31.960  -->  00:15:34.139
it up to you. I encourage you to create

728

00:15:34.139  -->  00:15:34.149

729

00:15:34.149  -->  00:15:36.840
the elements of the storyline for the

730

00:15:36.840  -->  00:15:36.850

731

00:15:36.850  -->  00:15:39.870
remaining four machines. Just remember

732

00:15:39.870  -->  00:15:39.880

733

00:15:39.880  -->  00:15:41.940
that in order to if you want to keep the

734

00:15:41.940  -->  00:15:41.950

735

00:15:41.950  -->  00:15:45.000
formatting consistent just duplicate the

736

00:15:45.000  -->  00:15:45.010

737

00:15:45.010  -->  00:15:47.820
tabs whenever you're creating a new tab

738

00:15:47.820  -->  00:15:47.830

739

00:15:47.830  -->  00:15:49.410
duplicate the sheets duplicate the

740

00:15:49.410  -->  00:15:49.420

741

00:15:49.420  -->  00:15:51.180
workbooks and then just drag everything

742

00:15:51.180  -->  00:15:51.190

743

00:15:51.190  -->  00:15:53.070
into a storyline. It should be pretty

744

00:15:53.070  -->  00:15:53.080

745

00:15:53.080  -->  00:15:54.480
straightforward.

746

00:15:54.480  -->  00:15:54.490

747

00:15:54.490  -->  00:15:55.800
The probably, the only complex thing

748

00:15:55.800  -->  00:15:55.810

749

00:15:55.810  -->  00:15:58.079
is to describe the findings and text but

750

00:15:58.079  -->  00:15:58.089

751

00:15:58.089  -->  00:16:00.540
I'm sure you'll be fine of that and in

752

00:16:00.540  -->  00:16:00.550

753

00:16:00.550  -->  00:16:01.889
the next tutorial I will show you the

754

00:16:01.889  -->  00:16:01.899

755

00:16:01.899  -->  00:16:03.840
final result and we can compare

756

00:16:03.840  -->  00:16:03.850

757

00:16:03.850  -->  00:16:05.790
everything in the next tutorial and I

758

00:16:05.790  -->  00:16:05.800

759

00:16:05.800  -->  00:16:06.870
look forward to seeing you then

760

00:16:06.870  -->  00:16:06.880

761

00:16:06.880  -->  00:16:13.529
until next time, Happy Analyzing!
