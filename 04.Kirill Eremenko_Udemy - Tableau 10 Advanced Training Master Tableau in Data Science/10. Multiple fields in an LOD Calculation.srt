00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:06,289
Hello and welcome back to the advanced

2

00:00:06,289  -->  00:00:06,299

3

00:00:06,299  -->  00:00:07,909
course in Tableau, and in today's

4

00:00:07,909  -->  00:00:07,919

5

00:00:07,919  -->  00:00:09,410
tutorial we're going to expand our

6

00:00:09,410  -->  00:00:09,420

7

00:00:09,420  -->  00:00:11,870
knowledge on LOD calculations and we'll

8

00:00:11,870  -->  00:00:11,880

9

00:00:11,880  -->  00:00:15,829
see how we can apply multiple fields or

10

00:00:15,829  -->  00:00:15,839

11

00:00:15,839  -->  00:00:19,490
multiple dimensions inside an LOD or

12

00:00:19,490  -->  00:00:19,500

13

00:00:19,500  -->  00:00:21,980
level of detail calculation. So let's

14

00:00:21,980  -->  00:00:21,990

15

00:00:21,990  -->  00:00:23,599
have a look at that and first of all

16

00:00:23,599  -->  00:00:23,609

17

00:00:23,609  -->  00:00:25,400
let's find out the reason why we would want

18

00:00:25,400  -->  00:00:25,410

19

00:00:25,410  -->  00:00:27,109
to do that. Well here we've got our

20

00:00:27,109  -->  00:00:27,119

21

00:00:27,119  -->  00:00:29,779
beautiful beautiful map that we've

22

00:00:29,779  -->  00:00:29,789

23

00:00:29,789  -->  00:00:32,600
created and it's showing us exactly what

24

00:00:32,600  -->  00:00:32,610

25

00:00:32,610  -->  00:00:33,350
we want.

26

00:00:33,350  -->  00:00:33,360

27

00:00:33,360  -->  00:00:36,049
So for every city it's showing the

28

00:00:36,049  -->  00:00:36,059

29

00:00:36,059  -->  00:00:40,430
normalized by state proportion that it

30

00:00:40,430  -->  00:00:40,440

31

00:00:40,440  -->  00:00:43,010
contributes to the profit of that state.

32

00:00:43,010  -->  00:00:43,020

33

00:00:43,020  -->  00:00:45,229
So it's it's quite a powerful

34

00:00:45,229  -->  00:00:45,239

35

00:00:45,239  -->  00:00:47,119
visualization but what happens if we

36

00:00:47,119  -->  00:00:47,129

37

00:00:47,129  -->  00:00:49,010
want to change this visualization, what

38

00:00:49,010  -->  00:00:49,020

39

00:00:49,020  -->  00:00:51,619
happens if we want to for some reason go

40

00:00:51,619  -->  00:00:51,629

41

00:00:51,629  -->  00:00:55,850
down to the level of postal code? So

42

00:00:55,850  -->  00:00:55,860

43

00:00:55,860  -->  00:00:58,069
we're so far we have country, state, city.

44

00:00:58,069  -->  00:00:58,079

45

00:00:58,079  -->  00:00:59,750
What if you want to make it even more

46

00:00:59,750  -->  00:00:59,760

47

00:00:59,760  -->  00:01:02,389
granular? We want to go down to the level

48

00:01:02,389  -->  00:01:02,399

49

00:01:02,399  -->  00:01:05,240
of postal code then what will happen to

50

00:01:05,240  -->  00:01:05,250

51

00:01:05,250  -->  00:01:07,580
this visualization right? So generally

52

00:01:07,580  -->  00:01:07,590

53

00:01:07,590  -->  00:01:09,679
like what you expect is that you will

54

00:01:09,679  -->  00:01:09,689

55

00:01:09,689  -->  00:01:11,990
see the same visualization, but instead of city,

56

00:01:11,990  -->  00:01:12,000

57

00:01:12,000  -->  00:01:13,550
you'll have postal codes and their

58

00:01:13,550  -->  00:01:13,560

59

00:01:13,560  -->  00:01:15,350
contributions to the whole profit of

60

00:01:15,350  -->  00:01:15,360

61

00:01:15,360  -->  00:01:17,570
that state. So let's have a look at that

62

00:01:17,570  -->  00:01:17,580

63

00:01:17,580  -->  00:01:19,399
I'm going to click this plus sign as you

64

00:01:19,399  -->  00:01:19,409

65

00:01:19,409  -->  00:01:21,890
can see no unfortunately not

66

00:01:21,890  -->  00:01:21,900

67

00:01:21,900  -->  00:01:24,800
unfortunately adding postal code into

68

00:01:24,800  -->  00:01:24,810

69

00:01:24,810  -->  00:01:27,200
our visualization completely messes up

70

00:01:27,200  -->  00:01:27,210

71

00:01:27,210  -->  00:01:29,929
the visualization. So why is that? What

72

00:01:29,929  -->  00:01:29,939

73

00:01:29,939  -->  00:01:32,480
happened here? Let's get to the bottom of

74

00:01:32,480  -->  00:01:32,490

75

00:01:32,490  -->  00:01:33,050
this.

76

00:01:33,050  -->  00:01:33,060

77

00:01:33,060  -->  00:01:36,319
Well now that we know how the level of

78

00:01:36,319  -->  00:01:36,329

79

00:01:36,329  -->  00:01:39,499
detail calculation works, we can trace

80

00:01:39,499  -->  00:01:39,509

81

00:01:39,509  -->  00:01:41,660
back what exactly happened. So if we edit

82

00:01:41,660  -->  00:01:41,670

83

00:01:41,670  -->  00:01:43,850
the level of detail calculation and look

84

00:01:43,850  -->  00:01:43,860

85

00:01:43,860  -->  00:01:45,710
at it here that the one that we're using

86

00:01:45,710  -->  00:01:45,720

87

00:01:45,720  -->  00:01:47,389
in this visualization you'll see that

88

00:01:47,389  -->  00:01:47,399

89

00:01:47,399  -->  00:01:50,450
we've got exclude city and then sum by

90

00:01:50,450  -->  00:01:50,460

91

00:01:50,460  -->  00:01:53,420
profit, right? So basically again let's

92

00:01:53,420  -->  00:01:53,430

93

00:01:53,430  -->  00:01:55,399
think in terms of relative and absolute

94

00:01:55,399  -->  00:01:55,409

95

00:01:55,409  -->  00:01:59,060
pathways on a hard drive so that little

96

00:01:59,060  -->  00:01:59,070

97

00:01:59,070  -->  00:02:01,730
trick that we talked about our

98

00:02:01,730  -->  00:02:01,740

99

00:02:01,740  -->  00:02:04,249
theoretical approach theoretical trick

100

00:02:04,249  -->  00:02:04,259

101

00:02:04,259  -->  00:02:06,139
that we talked about when thinking about

102

00:02:06,139  -->  00:02:06,149

103

00:02:06,149  -->  00:02:08,210
the level of detail calculation. So include

104

00:02:08,210  -->  00:02:08,220

105

00:02:08,220  -->  00:02:12,300
and exclude they are relative. They

106

00:02:12,300  -->  00:02:12,310

107

00:02:12,310  -->  00:02:14,280
exclude something relative to your

108

00:02:14,280  -->  00:02:14,290

109

00:02:14,290  -->  00:02:16,589
current visualization. So here what it's

110

00:02:16,589  -->  00:02:16,599

111

00:02:16,599  -->  00:02:19,559
doing is out of all of our dimensions to

112

00:02:19,559  -->  00:02:19,569

113

00:02:19,569  -->  00:02:21,870
the blue blue ones that we have here and

114

00:02:21,870  -->  00:02:21,880

115

00:02:21,880  -->  00:02:24,210
here we currently have only so all this

116

00:02:24,210  -->  00:02:24,220

117

00:02:24,220  -->  00:02:26,070
is green. These are not dimensions.

118

00:02:26,070  -->  00:02:26,080

119

00:02:26,080  -->  00:02:28,110
These are blue and these are dimensions

120

00:02:28,110  -->  00:02:28,120

121

00:02:28,120  -->  00:02:30,479
and you can see here we've got four so

122

00:02:30,479  -->  00:02:30,489

123

00:02:30,489  -->  00:02:32,520
what it's doing is it's saying if you

124

00:02:32,520  -->  00:02:32,530

125

00:02:32,530  -->  00:02:35,550
find a dimension called city excluded

126

00:02:35,550  -->  00:02:35,560

127

00:02:35,560  -->  00:02:37,650
from the visualization so take city

128

00:02:37,650  -->  00:02:37,660

129

00:02:37,660  -->  00:02:40,890
remove it and then calculate the sum of

130

00:02:40,890  -->  00:02:40,900

131

00:02:40,900  -->  00:02:43,110
profit right. So basically it's saying do this

132

00:02:43,110  -->  00:02:43,120

133

00:02:43,120  -->  00:02:45,809
and calculate the sum of profit but the

134

00:02:45,809  -->  00:02:45,819

135

00:02:45,819  -->  00:02:48,870
problem here is that that doesn't take

136

00:02:48,870  -->  00:02:48,880

137

00:02:48,880  -->  00:02:52,710
us to the level of the state. To it doesn't

138

00:02:52,710  -->  00:02:52,720

139

00:02:52,720  -->  00:02:54,270
take us to the aggregation level of

140

00:02:54,270  -->  00:02:54,280

141

00:02:54,280  -->  00:02:57,420
state because we still have the postal

142

00:02:57,420  -->  00:02:57,430

143

00:02:57,430  -->  00:02:59,759
code here. The postal code is still

144

00:02:59,759  -->  00:02:59,769

145

00:02:59,769  -->  00:03:02,070
keeping it and keeping us at that very

146

00:03:02,070  -->  00:03:02,080

147

00:03:02,080  -->  00:03:04,229
granular level even though we've removed

148

00:03:04,229  -->  00:03:04,239

149

00:03:04,239  -->  00:03:08,190
city. So how can we fix this? How can we

150

00:03:08,190  -->  00:03:08,200

151

00:03:08,200  -->  00:03:12,539
improve? Or how can we account for that?

152

00:03:12,539  -->  00:03:12,549

153

00:03:12,549  -->  00:03:14,009
Well what we can do is we can say

154

00:03:14,009  -->  00:03:14,019

155

00:03:14,019  -->  00:03:17,220
exclude not only city, but exclude coma,

156

00:03:17,220  -->  00:03:17,230

157

00:03:17,230  -->  00:03:20,880
postal code, right? So what this will do

158

00:03:20,880  -->  00:03:20,890

159

00:03:20,890  -->  00:03:23,400
is it will exclude city and postal code,

160

00:03:23,400  -->  00:03:23,410

161

00:03:23,410  -->  00:03:26,130
if it finds them from our visualization.

162

00:03:26,130  -->  00:03:26,140

163

00:03:26,140  -->  00:03:28,890
So basically, you'll do this takeout city, postal

164

00:03:28,890  -->  00:03:28,900

165

00:03:28,900  -->  00:03:31,380
code, city go back to the state level and

166

00:03:31,380  -->  00:03:31,390

167

00:03:31,390  -->  00:03:34,140
let's don't mind this this chart that we

168

00:03:34,140  -->  00:03:34,150

169

00:03:34,150  -->  00:03:36,300
have here. Basically it'll go back to this

170

00:03:36,300  -->  00:03:36,310

171

00:03:36,310  -->  00:03:39,059
chart because here we've got the level

172

00:03:39,059  -->  00:03:39,069

173

00:03:39,069  -->  00:03:41,849
of detail calculations instead of so

174

00:03:41,849  -->  00:03:41,859

175

00:03:41,859  -->  00:03:45,960
what we would do is but this has label

176

00:03:45,960  -->  00:03:45,970

177

00:03:45,970  -->  00:03:48,420
there. So there's our profit and remove

178

00:03:48,420  -->  00:03:48,430

179

00:03:48,430  -->  00:03:50,490
this other one as label. So you'd go back

180

00:03:50,490  -->  00:03:50,500

181

00:03:50,500  -->  00:03:52,979
to this chart with the profits because

182

00:03:52,979  -->  00:03:52,989

183

00:03:52,989  -->  00:03:55,140
we want the sum of profit. As you can see sum of

184

00:03:55,140  -->  00:03:55,150

185

00:03:55,150  -->  00:03:57,720
profit here and then it would take

186

00:03:57,720  -->  00:03:57,730

187

00:03:57,730  -->  00:04:00,180
a sum of profit from here. Let's put this

188

00:04:00,180  -->  00:04:00,190

189

00:04:00,190  -->  00:04:02,520
back and then it would go back to this

190

00:04:02,520  -->  00:04:02,530

191

00:04:02,530  -->  00:04:04,319
visualization and then apply sum of

192

00:04:04,319  -->  00:04:04,329

193

00:04:04,329  -->  00:04:06,569
profit. So let's give this a go. So let's

194

00:04:06,569  -->  00:04:06,579

195

00:04:06,579  -->  00:04:08,940
click OK here. As you can see it's now

196

00:04:08,940  -->  00:04:08,950

197

00:04:08,950  -->  00:04:12,420
fixed up and moreover if I cancel city

198

00:04:12,420  -->  00:04:12,430

199

00:04:12,430  -->  00:04:16,050
so if I close city and I mean remove postal

200

00:04:16,050  -->  00:04:16,060

201

00:04:16,060  -->  00:04:18,360
code so it doesn't matter if I have if

202

00:04:18,360  -->  00:04:18,370

203

00:04:18,370  -->  00:04:20,880
I'd if I wanted at the country, state,

204

00:04:20,880  -->  00:04:20,890

205

00:04:20,890  -->  00:04:23,490
city level of granularity. It works right?

206

00:04:23,490  -->  00:04:23,500

207

00:04:23,500  -->  00:04:25,120
So it works fine as it used

208

00:04:25,120  -->  00:04:25,130

209

00:04:25,130  -->  00:04:27,790
too. If I add postal code, it also works.

210

00:04:27,790  -->  00:04:27,800

211

00:04:27,800  -->  00:04:31,270
You will notice that not many cities

212

00:04:31,270  -->  00:04:31,280

213

00:04:31,280  -->  00:04:32,650
have different postal codes in our

214

00:04:32,650  -->  00:04:32,660

215

00:04:32,660  -->  00:04:34,720
data set. That's just a feature about

216

00:04:34,720  -->  00:04:34,730

217

00:04:34,730  -->  00:04:36,280
data set but if you look over here

218

00:04:36,280  -->  00:04:36,290

219

00:04:36,290  -->  00:04:38,110
you'll see that they are quite a few

220

00:04:38,110  -->  00:04:38,120

221

00:04:38,120  -->  00:04:41,500
there are a few that change so as I do

222

00:04:41,500  -->  00:04:41,510

223

00:04:41,510  -->  00:04:44,200
that there's if all is a few that change

224

00:04:44,200  -->  00:04:44,210

225

00:04:44,210  -->  00:04:46,570
right or if you look here you can see

226

00:04:46,570  -->  00:04:46,580

227

00:04:46,580  -->  00:04:49,390
that in Wyoming there's two cities here

228

00:04:49,390  -->  00:04:49,400

229

00:04:49,400  -->  00:04:52,090
one under each other to postal codes so

230

00:04:52,090  -->  00:04:52,100

231

00:04:52,100  -->  00:04:53,710
if i look at the data, we'll see that

232

00:04:53,710  -->  00:04:53,720

233

00:04:53,720  -->  00:04:57,880
this 82902 postal code or 82901,

234

00:04:57,880  -->  00:04:57,890

235

00:04:57,890  -->  00:05:01,330
and one is behind the other.

236

00:05:01,330  -->  00:05:01,340

237

00:05:01,340  -->  00:05:03,940
So zoom in a bit you can see them over

238

00:05:03,940  -->  00:05:03,950

239

00:05:03,950  -->  00:05:06,910
there so it works in both cases and you

240

00:05:06,910  -->  00:05:06,920

241

00:05:06,920  -->  00:05:09,790
can actually check so if we take Wyoming

242

00:05:09,790  -->  00:05:09,800

243

00:05:09,800  -->  00:05:12,790
and view data here you'll see that

244

00:05:12,790  -->  00:05:12,800

245

00:05:12,800  -->  00:05:16,060
we've got three possible codes and the

246

00:05:16,060  -->  00:05:16,070

247

00:05:16,070  -->  00:05:19,570
total of that percentage so if you add

248

00:05:19,570  -->  00:05:19,580

249

00:05:19,580  -->  00:05:21,220
these up it will add up

250

00:05:21,220  -->  00:05:21,230

251

00:05:21,230  -->  00:05:24,490
it should add up to a total of one

252

00:05:24,490  -->  00:05:24,500

253

00:05:24,500  -->  00:05:27,820
exactly. So it works perfectly fine and

254

00:05:27,820  -->  00:05:27,830

255

00:05:27,830  -->  00:05:31,000
this is a good illustration that you can

256

00:05:31,000  -->  00:05:31,010

257

00:05:31,010  -->  00:05:33,550
actually specify several dimensions that

258

00:05:33,550  -->  00:05:33,560

259

00:05:33,560  -->  00:05:36,580
you want to exclude or include so the

260

00:05:36,580  -->  00:05:36,590

261

00:05:36,590  -->  00:05:38,830
same would work totally fine for include

262

00:05:38,830  -->  00:05:38,840

263

00:05:38,840  -->  00:05:40,780
you can specify several dimensions in

264

00:05:40,780  -->  00:05:40,790

265

00:05:40,790  -->  00:05:43,900
your level of detail calculation so

266

00:05:43,900  -->  00:05:43,910

267

00:05:43,910  -->  00:05:46,270
let's have a look at it again and it

268

00:05:46,270  -->  00:05:46,280

269

00:05:46,280  -->  00:05:49,300
there it is exclude then the dimensions

270

00:05:49,300  -->  00:05:49,310

271

00:05:49,310  -->  00:05:52,300
that you want to exclude and the colon

272

00:05:52,300  -->  00:05:52,310

273

00:05:52,310  -->  00:05:54,880
and then the aggregation. So and again

274

00:05:54,880  -->  00:05:54,890

275

00:05:54,890  -->  00:05:56,710
if it doesn't find a dimension for

276

00:05:56,710  -->  00:05:56,720

277

00:05:56,720  -->  00:05:58,360
instance in this case we've got city but

278

00:05:58,360  -->  00:05:58,370

279

00:05:58,370  -->  00:05:59,500
we don't have possible code on

280

00:05:59,500  -->  00:05:59,510

281

00:05:59,510  -->  00:06:01,480
visualization, if it doesn't find this

282

00:06:01,480  -->  00:06:01,490

283

00:06:01,490  -->  00:06:03,490
dimension it will simply it can or this

284

00:06:03,490  -->  00:06:03,500

285

00:06:03,500  -->  00:06:06,130
command to exclude that dimension so

286

00:06:06,130  -->  00:06:06,140

287

00:06:06,140  -->  00:06:08,230
there's no conflict of that sort

288

00:06:08,230  -->  00:06:08,240

289

00:06:08,240  -->  00:06:09,430
happening here.

290

00:06:09,430  -->  00:06:09,440

291

00:06:09,440  -->  00:06:12,370
Alright so that's how you can include

292

00:06:12,370  -->  00:06:12,380

293

00:06:12,380  -->  00:06:14,020
several dimensions in your level of

294

00:06:14,020  -->  00:06:14,030

295

00:06:14,030  -->  00:06:16,210
detail calculation. Hope you enjoyed this

296

00:06:16,210  -->  00:06:16,220

297

00:06:16,220  -->  00:06:18,610
tutorial and I look forward to seeing

298

00:06:18,610  -->  00:06:18,620

299

00:06:18,620  -->  00:06:20,080
you next time.

300

00:06:20,080  -->  00:06:20,090

301

00:06:20,090  -->  00:06:26,740
Until then, happy analyzing.
