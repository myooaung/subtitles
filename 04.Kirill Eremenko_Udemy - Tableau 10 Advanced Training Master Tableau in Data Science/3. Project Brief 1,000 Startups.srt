1

00:00:05,000  -->  00:00:06,970
To get the materials for the section all

2

00:00:06,970  -->  00:00:09,150
you have to do is open up a browser and

3

00:00:09,160  -->  00:00:12,180
go to superdatascience.com/tableau-

4

00:00:12,190  -->  00:00:14,609
advanced and then if you scroll

5

00:00:14,619  -->  00:00:16,410
down here to Section 2. Groups and Sets

6

00:00:16,420  -->  00:00:19,020
then you'll find a PDF document and an

7

00:00:19,030  -->  00:00:20,880
excel file which is called a 1000

8

00:00:20,890  -->  00:00:22,740
startups. So go ahead and download those

9

00:00:22,750  -->  00:00:25,470
2 and we will pick it up from here.

10

00:00:25,480  -->  00:00:27,480
Alright now that we have got all the

11

00:00:27,490  -->  00:00:29,279
files let's have a look at the challenge

12

00:00:29,289  -->  00:00:31,560
for this section and there it is

13

00:00:31,570  -->  00:00:33,869
section 2 The Challenge. You have been

14

00:00:33,879  -->  00:00:36,450
approached by a Venture Capital Fund. The

15

00:00:36,460  -->  00:00:38,489
Board of Directors are currently

16

00:00:38,499  -->  00:00:41,130
reviewing 1,000 potentially interesting

17

00:00:41,140  -->  00:00:43,229
startups and deciding on which ones are

18

00:00:43,239  -->  00:00:45,239
going to invest in. The criterion for

    00:00:45,249  -->  00:00:47,069
selecting investments for this fund is a

19

00:00:47,079  -->  00:00:49,739
combination of High Revenue, Low Expenses,

    00:00:49,749  -->  00:00:51,930
and Top Growth and all of those

20

00:00:51,940  -->  00:00:55,500
parameters are for 2015. Your task is to

21

00:00:55,510  -->  00:00:57,840
assist the Board in identifying which

22

00:00:57,850  -->  00:01:00,180
businesses represent the best investment

23

00:01:00,190  -->  00:01:01,950
opportunities. Sounds very exciting

24

00:01:01,960  -->  00:01:02,910
doesn't it?

25

00:01:02,920  -->  00:01:05,460
I'm getting excited, myself just by

26

00:01:05,470  -->  00:01:07,800
looking at this challenge. So let's have

27

00:01:07,810  -->  00:01:10,350
a look at the data now what has the

28

00:01:10,360  -->  00:01:12,930
Board of Directors supplied us with? I'm

    00:01:12,940  -->  00:01:14,910
going to zoom in here and the first

29

00:01:14,920  -->  00:01:15,990
thing we should notice is that there's

30

00:01:16,000  -->  00:01:18,780
two tabs so tab number 1 looks like

31

00:01:18,790  -->  00:01:22,530
it's a description and overall summary

32

00:01:22,540  -->  00:01:23,880
of the companies we're going to be

33

00:01:23,890  -->  00:01:25,590
investigated so right away let's check

34

00:01:25,600  -->  00:01:27,570
that there's a thousand rows, there is a

35

00:01:27,580  -->  00:01:30,480
thousand rows then we've got the names

36

00:01:30,490  -->  00:01:32,130
here, the industry they're working in, a

37

00:01:32,140  -->  00:01:34,290
description of what they do

    00:01:34,300  -->  00:01:37,170
and by the way this is all fake data and

38

00:01:37,180  -->  00:01:40,830
it's all made up numbers and names so if

39

00:01:40,840  -->  00:01:43,530
there is any kind of matching to real

40

00:01:43,540  -->  00:01:45,060
companies in the world then it's,

41

00:01:45,070  -->  00:01:47,940
it's a complete coincidence and here

42

00:01:47,950  -->  00:01:49,440
we've also got the year founded,

43

00:01:49,450  -->  00:01:51,180
employees, state looks like

44

00:01:51,190  -->  00:01:53,880
all of these are American companies, the

45

00:01:53,890  -->  00:01:55,620
city and the metro area.

46

00:01:55,630  -->  00:01:56,820
Alright let's look at the second tab now

47

00:01:56,830  -->  00:02:00,300
financials and in this tab we've

48

00:02:00,310  -->  00:02:02,220
got quite a few columns once again ID

49

00:02:02,230  -->  00:02:04,500
and names so now we know how to join the

50

00:02:04,510  -->  00:02:07,020
two, how to connect the two tabs using

51

00:02:07,030  -->  00:02:11,130
this ID column. Then we've got some 2015

52

00:02:11,130  -->  00:02:13,860
Financials Revenue, Expenses, Profit and

53

00:02:13,870  -->  00:02:14,640
Growth.

54

00:02:14,650  -->  00:02:18,179
Then we've got 14 and 13 and right away

55

00:02:18,189  -->  00:02:21,000
looking at the 2015 numbers and going

56

00:02:21,010  -->  00:02:22,229
back to the challenge we can see that

57

00:02:22,239  -->  00:02:23,970
we'll be working with revenue expenses

58

00:02:23,980  -->  00:02:26,009
and growth so we won't be using any of

59

00:02:26,019  -->  00:02:28,710
those and we won't be using also profit

60

00:02:28,720  -->  00:02:30,569
for 2015.

61

00:02:30,579  -->  00:02:32,610
Now another interesting thing that you

62

00:02:32,620  -->  00:02:34,530
might notice and probably it's a good

63

00:02:34,540  -->  00:02:36,240
thing to like investigate your data

64

00:02:36,250  -->  00:02:38,670
before you start working with in Tableau,

65

00:02:38,680  -->  00:02:40,860
is that here you've got industry for

66

00:02:40,870  -->  00:02:42,149
every single company and there's

67

00:02:42,159  -->  00:02:44,429
different industries here. Now in our

68

00:02:44,439  -->  00:02:47,160
challenge what it says is, The criterion

69

00:02:47,170  -->  00:02:48,720
for selecting investments for this fund

70

00:02:48,730  -->  00:02:50,039
is a combination of High Revenue,

71

00:02:50,049  -->  00:02:52,649
Low Expenses that's that's fine but what is

72

00:02:52,659  -->  00:02:55,440
Top Growth? What does top growth imply? Top

73

00:02:55,450  -->  00:02:57,629
growth could be top growth overall among

74

00:02:57,639  -->  00:02:59,849
the whole thousand or it could be top

75

00:02:59,859  -->  00:03:02,369
growth among the peers of the company so

76

00:03:02,379  -->  00:03:04,259
the company the other companies that are in

77

00:03:04,269  -->  00:03:07,559
the same industry as that company and

78

00:03:07,569  -->  00:03:09,780
quite often that is the case with

79

00:03:09,790  -->  00:03:11,940
venture capital funds because it is hard

80

00:03:11,950  -->  00:03:14,039
to compete again across different

81

00:03:14,049  -->  00:03:15,300
industries because there are certain

82

00:03:15,310  -->  00:03:18,300
constraints and so on. But also sometimes

83

00:03:18,310  -->  00:03:20,729
venture capitalist funds look for top

84

00:03:20,739  -->  00:03:22,800
growth overall, now this is one of the

85

00:03:22,810  -->  00:03:24,569
things that you would go back and you

86

00:03:24,579  -->  00:03:26,129
would confirm with the clients very

87

00:03:26,139  -->  00:03:28,890
important to clarify all of the

88

00:03:28,900  -->  00:03:31,979
conditions of your analysis before you

89

00:03:31,989  -->  00:03:34,349
proceed with it, but in this case we're

90

00:03:34,359  -->  00:03:36,270
going to assume that top growth means

91

00:03:36,280  -->  00:03:38,789
top growth overall, so regardless of the

92

00:03:38,799  -->  00:03:39,599
industry.

93

00:03:39,609  -->  00:03:42,330
Alright so we're done with that, let's go

94

00:03:42,340  -->  00:03:45,149
ahead and load this data into Tableau.

95

00:03:45,159  -->  00:03:50,189
Gonna bring up Tableau here and I'm

96

00:03:50,199  -->  00:03:52,649
going to connect to an excel file,

97

00:03:52,659  -->  00:03:55,199
1,000 startups there it is, perfect

98

00:03:55,209  -->  00:03:59,039
and because we already know how to join

99

00:03:59,049  -->  00:04:01,229
in Tableau we're going to do that right

100

00:04:01,239  -->  00:04:02,789
away we're going to take the overview

101

00:04:02,799  -->  00:04:04,170
tab and then we're going to join into

102

00:04:04,180  -->  00:04:07,080
the financials tab and here you can see

103

00:04:07,090  -->  00:04:08,250
that a join has been created

104

00:04:08,260  -->  00:04:09,990
automatically on the ID field which is

105

00:04:10,000  -->  00:04:11,939
exactly we want. Then we can quickly check

106

00:04:11,949  -->  00:04:14,189
that everything is ok here so one of the

107

00:04:14,199  -->  00:04:15,509
things that you might want to check is

108

00:04:15,519  -->  00:04:18,509
that just take a random name and for a

109

00:04:18,519  -->  00:04:22,140
random row down plus and then just

110

00:04:22,150  -->  00:04:23,760
check that it matches to the name from

111

00:04:23,770  -->  00:04:26,820
the other tab down plus. Ok perfect, now

112

00:04:26,830  -->  00:04:28,439
we go to sheet 1

113

00:04:28,449  -->  00:04:31,890
and here what we're going to do is we're

114

00:04:31,900  -->  00:04:33,360
going to prepare. So today we're going to

115

00:04:33,370  -->  00:04:35,790
quickly learn how to work with folders

116

00:04:35,800  -->  00:04:38,070
in Tableau. So very very easy topic

117

00:04:38,080  -->  00:04:40,049
its pretty much same as working folders

118

00:04:40,059  -->  00:04:41,790
on your computer,

119

00:04:41,800  -->  00:04:44,100
it just helps you organize your measures

120

00:04:44,110  -->  00:04:46,140
and dimensions cause you can see here we

121

00:04:46,150  -->  00:04:49,110
have quite a lot of measures and can get

122

00:04:49,120  -->  00:04:50,909
quite cluttered. This is actually a

123

00:04:50,919  -->  00:04:52,709
pretty simple example you sometimes

124

00:04:52,719  -->  00:04:55,529
you'll have 20, 30 and measures and

125

00:04:55,539  -->  00:04:57,779
dimensions or even up to a hundred so

126

00:04:57,789  -->  00:04:59,730
let's see how we can organize our

127

00:04:59,740  -->  00:05:01,890
workspace. First of all we want to right

128

00:05:01,900  -->  00:05:04,230
click anywhere on the dimensions all the

129

00:05:04,240  -->  00:05:06,209
measures and instead of group by

130

00:05:06,219  -->  00:05:08,489
data source table select group by

131

00:05:08,499  -->  00:05:11,999
folder and now instead of seeing where

132

00:05:12,009  -->  00:05:14,369
these fields came from they're all just

133

00:05:14,379  -->  00:05:16,170
listed altogether so if I'm going to go,

134

00:05:16,180  -->  00:05:18,540
if I go back, you'll see here that you

135

00:05:18,550  -->  00:05:20,489
can see which tab they came from, from the

136

00:05:20,499  -->  00:05:22,320
financials tab or from the overview tab

137

00:05:22,330  -->  00:05:24,689
same thing here. Now we're going to

138

00:05:24,699  -->  00:05:29,100
change to group by folder and now first

139

00:05:29,110  -->  00:05:30,659
thing we're going to do is remove the

140

00:05:30,669  -->  00:05:33,059
fields that are duplicate, so here we are

141

00:05:33,069  -->  00:05:35,519
you know that we joined on this field so

142

00:05:35,529  -->  00:05:37,260
it is a duplicate there's no point in

143

00:05:37,270  -->  00:05:38,909
having this one here. We'll hide this one

144

00:05:38,919  -->  00:05:40,920
and here we're going to hide name as

145

00:05:40,930  -->  00:05:42,989
well because we know it's the same. Now

146

00:05:42,999  -->  00:05:45,480
let's create folders for our financials,

147

00:05:45,490  -->  00:05:47,369
we're going to create a folder, we'll call

148

00:05:47,379  -->  00:05:53,820
it, 2015 financials and we'll take

149

00:05:53,830  -->  00:05:56,040
everything relating to 2015 and we'll

150

00:05:56,050  -->  00:05:58,889
drag it into that folder. Now, we'll create

151

00:05:58,899  -->  00:06:04,739
another folder 2014 financials and we'll

152

00:06:04,749  -->  00:06:06,659
take everything for 2014 and drag it

153

00:06:06,669  -->  00:06:10,589
into that folder and finally let me make

154

00:06:10,599  -->  00:06:14,939
some space, create folder 2013 financials

155

00:06:14,949  -->  00:06:18,269
and drag everything for 2013 to that

156

00:06:18,279  -->  00:06:20,459
folder. So what this does is now you can

157

00:06:20,469  -->  00:06:22,920
collapse these folders and not worry

158

00:06:22,930  -->  00:06:25,230
about them if you don't need the

159

00:06:25,240  -->  00:06:26,820
measures or if your cranium in

160

00:06:26,830  -->  00:06:28,980
dimensions, dimensions which are in those

161

00:06:28,990  -->  00:06:30,959
folder and we know already we're going

162

00:06:30,969  -->  00:06:33,089
to be working between 2015 data so we can just

163

00:06:33,099  -->  00:06:36,089
keep these folders that is as is you

164

00:06:36,099  -->  00:06:37,889
could have of course hit in these fields

165

00:06:37,899  -->  00:06:40,230
like we did with the ones up there but

166

00:06:40,240  -->  00:06:41,999
maybe at some point you might require

167

00:06:42,009  -->  00:06:43,379
them and you don't want to forget

168

00:06:43,389  -->  00:06:45,329
that you actually have them so the best

169

00:06:45,339  -->  00:06:47,219
practice here is just put them in a

170

00:06:47,229  -->  00:06:50,279
folder and collapse that folder. So there

171

00:06:50,289  -->  00:06:50,820
we go,

172

00:06:50,830  -->  00:06:53,159
everything ready. In the next tutorial, we

173

00:06:53,169  -->  00:06:56,999
will start working on our analysis and

174

00:06:57,009  -->  00:06:58,499
will kick off this section. I look

175

00:06:58,509  -->  00:06:59,790
forward to seeing you next time and

176

00:06:59,800  -->  00:07:06,360
until then, happy analyzing.
