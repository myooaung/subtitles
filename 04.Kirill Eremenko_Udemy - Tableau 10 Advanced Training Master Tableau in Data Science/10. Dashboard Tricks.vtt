00:00:05.300  -->  00:00:07.000
Welcome back to the advanced course on

2

00:00:07.000  -->  00:00:07.010

3

00:00:07.010  -->  00:00:09.640
Tableau and we are steadily approaching

4

00:00:09.640  -->  00:00:09.650

5

00:00:09.650  -->  00:00:12.879
the end of this section. All we have left

6

00:00:12.879  -->  00:00:12.889

7

00:00:12.889  -->  00:00:15.970
to do is to make this dashboard look

8

00:00:15.970  -->  00:00:15.980

9

00:00:15.980  -->  00:00:16.839
fantastic.

10

00:00:16.839  -->  00:00:16.849

11

00:00:16.849  -->  00:00:19.120
So let's jump straight into it and let's

12

00:00:19.120  -->  00:00:19.130

13

00:00:19.130  -->  00:00:22.150
fix this up so that it is presentable to

14

00:00:22.150  -->  00:00:22.160

15

00:00:22.160  -->  00:00:24.130
a board of directors.

16

00:00:24.130  -->  00:00:24.140

17

00:00:24.140  -->  00:00:25.660
Alright the first thing we want to do is

18

00:00:25.660  -->  00:00:25.670

19

00:00:25.670  -->  00:00:27.519
fix up this main area, it still looks bit

20

00:00:27.519  -->  00:00:27.529

21

00:00:27.529  -->  00:00:30.189
small and we can make it look a little

22

00:00:30.189  -->  00:00:30.199

23

00:00:30.199  -->  00:00:33.009
bit better so let's go to the

24

00:00:33.009  -->  00:00:33.019

25

00:00:33.019  -->  00:00:36.969
scatterplot and here we want to

26

00:00:36.969  -->  00:00:36.979

27

00:00:36.979  -->  00:00:38.740
increase the size, so probably that's

28

00:00:38.740  -->  00:00:38.750

29

00:00:38.750  -->  00:00:43.509
the main thing and increasing the size

30

00:00:43.509  -->  00:00:43.519

31

00:00:43.519  -->  00:00:46.960
and now we need to let's decrease or

32

00:00:46.960  -->  00:00:46.970

33

00:00:46.970  -->  00:00:51.340
increase the transparency. Now you can

34

00:00:51.340  -->  00:00:51.350

35

00:00:51.350  -->  00:00:53.079
see that by increasing the size we've

36

00:00:53.079  -->  00:00:53.089

37

00:00:53.089  -->  00:00:55.210
achieved that there's a lot sometimes a

38

00:00:55.210  -->  00:00:55.220

39

00:00:55.220  -->  00:00:58.180
big overlap but that doesn't really

40

00:00:58.180  -->  00:00:58.190

41

00:00:58.190  -->  00:01:00.939
matter because our focus is the red gems

42

00:01:00.939  -->  00:01:00.949

43

00:01:00.949  -->  00:01:03.729
and we want them to stand out what

44

00:01:03.729  -->  00:01:03.739

45

00:01:03.739  -->  00:01:05.740
happens with the blue stuff the blue

46

00:01:05.740  -->  00:01:05.750

47

00:01:05.750  -->  00:01:07.899
companies and we don't really mind so

48

00:01:07.899  -->  00:01:07.909

49

00:01:07.909  -->  00:01:09.190
that, that looks better.

50

00:01:09.190  -->  00:01:09.200

51

00:01:09.200  -->  00:01:14.440
Okay that's our scatterplot next we want

52

00:01:14.440  -->  00:01:14.450

53

00:01:14.450  -->  00:01:15.940
to do is we want to have consistent

54

00:01:15.940  -->  00:01:15.950

55

00:01:15.950  -->  00:01:19.330
colors we wanted this red to be the same

56

00:01:19.330  -->  00:01:19.340

57

00:01:19.340  -->  00:01:21.340
red as here let's go ahead and do that.

58

00:01:21.340  -->  00:01:21.350

59

00:01:21.350  -->  00:01:24.429
The scatterplot if we go to colors edit

60

00:01:24.429  -->  00:01:24.439

61

00:01:24.439  -->  00:01:27.010
colors we double-click we can copy the

62

00:01:27.010  -->  00:01:27.020

63

00:01:27.020  -->  00:01:31.419
code over here and then we go

64

00:01:31.419  -->  00:01:31.429

65

00:01:31.429  -->  00:01:35.440
over here or more probably to this one

66

00:01:35.440  -->  00:01:35.450

67

00:01:35.450  -->  00:01:39.099
and we just replace this red with the

68

00:01:39.099  -->  00:01:39.109

69

00:01:39.109  -->  00:01:43.090
same code, apply. Ok now I'm going to show

70

00:01:43.090  -->  00:01:43.100

71

00:01:43.100  -->  00:01:45.550
you a trick so here they go down into

72

00:01:45.550  -->  00:01:45.560

73

00:01:45.560  -->  00:01:47.469
gray but we don't want that. This gray

74

00:01:47.469  -->  00:01:47.479

75

00:01:47.479  -->  00:01:50.139
looks like this gray and that's not true

76

00:01:50.139  -->  00:01:50.149

77

00:01:50.149  -->  00:01:55.270
all of these are companies that are

78

00:01:55.270  -->  00:01:55.280

79

00:01:55.280  -->  00:01:57.520
above the growth level, like the they

80

00:01:57.520  -->  00:01:57.530

81

00:01:57.530  -->  00:02:00.669
this part of the visualization, doesn't

82

00:02:00.669  -->  00:02:00.679

83

00:02:00.679  -->  00:02:04.510
have a filter on revenue and expenses. So

84

00:02:04.510  -->  00:02:04.520

85

00:02:04.520  -->  00:02:06.940
maybe some of them are under in

86

00:02:06.940  -->  00:02:06.950

87

00:02:06.950  -->  00:02:08.710
revenue expenses but its necessary,

88

00:02:08.710  -->  00:02:08.720

89

00:02:08.720  -->  00:02:10.600
doesn't necessarily mean these exact

90

00:02:10.600  -->  00:02:10.610

91

00:02:10.610  -->  00:02:12.039
ones that could be up here it could be

92

00:02:12.039  -->  00:02:12.049

93

00:02:12.049  -->  00:02:12.970
or wherever.

94

00:02:12.970  -->  00:02:12.980

95

00:02:12.980  -->  00:02:15.670
So we don't want to confuse the user, we

96

00:02:15.670  -->  00:02:15.680

97

00:02:15.680  -->  00:02:16.850
want all these to

98

00:02:16.850  -->  00:02:16.860

99

00:02:16.860  -->  00:02:18.770
be red. We want all of them to

100

00:02:18.770  -->  00:02:18.780

101

00:02:18.780  -->  00:02:21.950
represent so everything here is actually

102

00:02:21.950  -->  00:02:21.960

103

00:02:21.960  -->  00:02:25.670
a diamond on our visualization because

104

00:02:25.670  -->  00:02:25.680

105

00:02:25.680  -->  00:02:28.280
we can't make these into diamonds we can

106

00:02:28.280  -->  00:02:28.290

107

00:02:28.290  -->  00:02:30.620
just make them red, so the user will

108

00:02:30.620  -->  00:02:30.630

109

00:02:30.630  -->  00:02:34.850
know that this red is like all the ones

110

00:02:34.850  -->  00:02:34.860

111

00:02:34.860  -->  00:02:36.620
that are in red here are definitely

112

00:02:36.620  -->  00:02:36.630

113

00:02:36.630  -->  00:02:39.710
going to be in here, but not all the ones

114

00:02:39.710  -->  00:02:39.720

115

00:02:39.720  -->  00:02:41.420
in here and red are going to be in red

116

00:02:41.420  -->  00:02:41.430

117

00:02:41.430  -->  00:02:43.010
on the visualization and that's okay

118

00:02:43.010  -->  00:02:43.020

119

00:02:43.020  -->  00:02:44.390
that's fine,

120

00:02:44.390  -->  00:02:44.400

121

00:02:44.400  -->  00:02:46.400
so basically the red ones here are

122

00:02:46.400  -->  00:02:46.410

123

00:02:46.410  -->  00:02:49.250
subset of the red ones here. Let's go

124

00:02:49.250  -->  00:02:49.260

125

00:02:49.260  -->  00:02:53.360
ahead and fix up this gray so there is

126

00:02:53.360  -->  00:02:53.370

127

00:02:53.370  -->  00:02:55.430
no gray and I'm going to show you a

128

00:02:55.430  -->  00:02:55.440

129

00:02:55.440  -->  00:02:59.300
quick trick here start over here and

130

00:02:59.300  -->  00:02:59.310

131

00:02:59.310  -->  00:03:03.500
color, edit colors so we're going to go

132

00:03:03.500  -->  00:03:03.510

133

00:03:03.510  -->  00:03:07.010
to advanced and we're going to start and

134

00:03:07.010  -->  00:03:07.020

135

00:03:07.020  -->  00:03:08.390
end so we're going to put the starting

136

00:03:08.390  -->  00:03:08.400

137

00:03:08.400  -->  00:03:10.100
point below. We're going to put start

138

00:03:10.100  -->  00:03:10.110

139

00:03:10.110  -->  00:03:12.229
pointing if we put the starting point at

140

00:03:12.229  -->  00:03:12.239

141

00:03:12.239  -->  00:03:15.740
zero then by the time it gets to the

142

00:03:15.740  -->  00:03:15.750

143

00:03:15.750  -->  00:03:17.960
lowest value here it's already red so

144

00:03:17.960  -->  00:03:17.970

145

00:03:17.970  -->  00:03:20.479
that all the gray stuff has started at

146

00:03:20.479  -->  00:03:20.489

147

00:03:20.489  -->  00:03:22.910
zero and now it's it's 500%

148

00:03:22.910  -->  00:03:22.920

149

00:03:22.920  -->  00:03:24.949
it's already red but

150

00:03:24.949  -->  00:03:24.959

151

00:03:24.959  -->  00:03:27.080
that's too red and you can't really tell

152

00:03:27.080  -->  00:03:27.090

153

00:03:27.090  -->  00:03:30.080
the difference. So let's fix that up a

154

00:03:30.080  -->  00:03:30.090

155

00:03:30.090  -->  00:03:32.810
bit, let's say let's put a 2 so here you

156

00:03:32.810  -->  00:03:32.820

157

00:03:32.820  -->  00:03:34.729
can see it's pale red here it's darker

158

00:03:34.729  -->  00:03:34.739

159

00:03:34.739  -->  00:03:36.110
and that's what we want that's good so

160

00:03:36.110  -->  00:03:36.120

161

00:03:36.120  -->  00:03:39.440
just a subtle difference which will tell

162

00:03:39.440  -->  00:03:39.450

163

00:03:39.450  -->  00:03:44.030
the user that these are indeed

164

00:03:44.030  -->  00:03:44.040

165

00:03:44.040  -->  00:03:46.190
they do have a higher growth rate than

166

00:03:46.190  -->  00:03:46.200

167

00:03:46.200  -->  00:03:48.410
these ones but they're still all red.

168

00:03:48.410  -->  00:03:48.420

169

00:03:48.420  -->  00:03:53.780
Okay so that's good that's colors fixed up

170

00:03:53.780  -->  00:03:53.790

171

00:03:53.790  -->  00:03:58.009
what else do we want? Well, we don't want

172

00:03:58.009  -->  00:03:58.019

173

00:03:58.019  -->  00:04:00.560
this name here. We don't want the title

174

00:04:00.560  -->  00:04:00.570

175

00:04:00.570  -->  00:04:03.470
here. We might add a title for the whole

176

00:04:03.470  -->  00:04:03.480

177

00:04:03.480  -->  00:04:04.460
dashboard.

178

00:04:04.460  -->  00:04:04.470

179

00:04:04.470  -->  00:04:09.259
Let's do that that'll be fun. So text

180

00:04:09.259  -->  00:04:09.269

181

00:04:09.269  -->  00:04:14.240
just put it in here at the top and let's

182

00:04:14.240  -->  00:04:14.250

183

00:04:14.250  -->  00:04:21.150
say the star top quadrant

184

00:04:21.150  -->  00:04:21.160

185

00:04:21.160  -->  00:04:25.560
and let's get a bigger size maybe they

186

00:04:25.560  -->  00:04:25.570

187

00:04:25.570  -->  00:04:28.710
can bold and start of that see what we get,

188

00:04:28.710  -->  00:04:28.720

189

00:04:28.720  -->  00:04:31.680
ok so this is not exactly in the right

190

00:04:31.680  -->  00:04:31.690

191

00:04:31.690  -->  00:04:35.550
spot, we want it there and make it

192

00:04:35.550  -->  00:04:35.560

193

00:04:35.560  -->  00:04:39.030
smaller and double-click center it. Ok

194

00:04:39.030  -->  00:04:39.040

195

00:04:39.040  -->  00:04:43.530
looking a bit better but we want to add

196

00:04:43.530  -->  00:04:43.540

197

00:04:43.540  -->  00:04:46.290
a bit of like color to our dashboard

198

00:04:46.290  -->  00:04:46.300

199

00:04:46.300  -->  00:04:50.100
make it stand out a bit better so we

200

00:04:50.100  -->  00:04:50.110

201

00:04:50.110  -->  00:04:53.160
want to change this background and we

202

00:04:53.160  -->  00:04:53.170

203

00:04:53.170  -->  00:04:55.800
want to make this whole line one of the

204

00:04:55.800  -->  00:04:55.810

205

00:04:55.810  -->  00:04:59.010
colors are red, blue or gray. So select

206

00:04:59.010  -->  00:04:59.020

207

00:04:59.020  -->  00:05:00.420
the one that you like the most

208

00:05:00.420  -->  00:05:00.430

209

00:05:00.430  -->  00:05:02.430
just for consistency purposes I'm going

210

00:05:02.430  -->  00:05:02.440

211

00:05:02.440  -->  00:05:03.930
to select blue so I'm going to go back

212

00:05:03.930  -->  00:05:03.940

213

00:05:03.940  -->  00:05:06.630
to my scatter plot and we're double

214

00:05:06.630  -->  00:05:06.640

215

00:05:06.640  -->  00:05:08.820
click on the blue, double click on the

216

00:05:08.820  -->  00:05:08.830

217

00:05:08.830  -->  00:05:12.060
blue, take the blue from here and then

218

00:05:12.060  -->  00:05:12.070

219

00:05:12.070  -->  00:05:14.310
I'm going to right click format text,

220

00:05:14.310  -->  00:05:14.320

221

00:05:14.320  -->  00:05:19.290
shading, more colors and just put in the

222

00:05:19.290  -->  00:05:19.300

223

00:05:19.300  -->  00:05:20.820
code here.

224

00:05:20.820  -->  00:05:20.830

225

00:05:20.830  -->  00:05:25.410
Ok now the text itself you double-click,

226

00:05:25.410  -->  00:05:25.420

227

00:05:25.420  -->  00:05:29.100
can make it white, blue. White and

228

00:05:29.100  -->  00:05:29.110

229

00:05:29.110  -->  00:05:31.290
blue is very good looks very good like

230

00:05:31.290  -->  00:05:31.300

231

00:05:31.300  -->  00:05:34.080
that change the fonts you usually want

232

00:05:34.080  -->  00:05:34.090

233

00:05:34.090  -->  00:05:36.390
to keep a consistent font speaking of

234

00:05:36.390  -->  00:05:36.400

235

00:05:36.400  -->  00:05:38.370
aesthetics and best practices you want

236

00:05:38.370  -->  00:05:38.380

237

00:05:38.380  -->  00:05:39.780
to keep a consistent font throughout your

238

00:05:39.780  -->  00:05:39.790

239

00:05:39.790  -->  00:05:42.210
dashboard but for the header it's okay

240

00:05:42.210  -->  00:05:42.220

241

00:05:42.220  -->  00:05:44.340
if you change the fonts to something

242

00:05:44.340  -->  00:05:44.350

243

00:05:44.350  -->  00:05:45.810
else so I'm going to change to Arial

244

00:05:45.810  -->  00:05:45.820

245

00:05:45.820  -->  00:05:49.560
black so it kind of makes that a bit

246

00:05:49.560  -->  00:05:49.570

247

00:05:49.570  -->  00:05:51.150
more of a statement

248

00:05:51.150  -->  00:05:51.160

249

00:05:51.160  -->  00:05:54.540
okay so that looks good, what else do I

250

00:05:54.540  -->  00:05:54.550

251

00:05:54.550  -->  00:05:56.760
want to change? Now let's look at the

252

00:05:56.760  -->  00:05:56.770

253

00:05:56.770  -->  00:06:01.140
fonts you don't want your axis to take

254

00:06:01.140  -->  00:06:01.150

255

00:06:01.150  -->  00:06:03.240
attention. You don't want them to grab

256

00:06:03.240  -->  00:06:03.250

257

00:06:03.250  -->  00:06:04.470
too much attention you want them to be

258

00:06:04.470  -->  00:06:04.480

259

00:06:04.480  -->  00:06:06.480
there for reference but right now

260

00:06:06.480  -->  00:06:06.490

261

00:06:06.490  -->  00:06:09.120
they're in bold and it's attracting

262

00:06:09.120  -->  00:06:09.130

263

00:06:09.130  -->  00:06:10.710
too much attention so ok, when we're doing

264

00:06:10.710  -->  00:06:10.720

265

00:06:10.720  -->  00:06:13.770
analysis and mining, data mining in our

266

00:06:13.770  -->  00:06:13.780

267

00:06:13.780  -->  00:06:15.720
worksheets but when some dashboard you

268

00:06:15.720  -->  00:06:15.730

269

00:06:15.730  -->  00:06:17.820
want them to be subtle so right-click

270

00:06:17.820  -->  00:06:17.830

271

00:06:17.830  -->  00:06:21.150
the axis or actually let's

272

00:06:21.150  -->  00:06:21.160

273

00:06:21.160  -->  00:06:22.980
right-click the whole sheet and click

274

00:06:22.980  -->  00:06:22.990

275

00:06:22.990  -->  00:06:25.920
format because there's no other things

276

00:06:25.920  -->  00:06:25.930

277

00:06:25.930  -->  00:06:27.960
in the sheet right now. In fact, if

278

00:06:27.960  -->  00:06:27.970

279

00:06:27.970  -->  00:06:30.090
other values appear in the sheet which

280

00:06:30.090  -->  00:06:30.100

281

00:06:30.100  -->  00:06:32.550
will see just now we want them also to

282

00:06:32.550  -->  00:06:32.560

283

00:06:32.560  -->  00:06:34.750
be subtle so let's change this to

284

00:06:34.750  -->  00:06:34.760

285

00:06:34.760  -->  00:06:38.260
not bold and let's see what happens if

286

00:06:38.260  -->  00:06:38.270

287

00:06:38.270  -->  00:06:39.700
we change it to a 10.

288

00:06:39.700  -->  00:06:39.710

289

00:06:39.710  -->  00:06:41.950
I think that looks good I think that

290

00:06:41.950  -->  00:06:41.960

291

00:06:41.960  -->  00:06:44.200
looks good so let's change this edit

292

00:06:44.200  -->  00:06:44.210

293

00:06:44.210  -->  00:06:46.450
axis we don't need 2015 because they

294

00:06:46.450  -->  00:06:46.460

295

00:06:46.460  -->  00:06:49.240
already know it's going to be 2015 and

296

00:06:49.240  -->  00:06:49.250

297

00:06:49.250  -->  00:06:51.400
edit axis here as well get rid of the

298

00:06:51.400  -->  00:06:51.410

299

00:06:51.410  -->  00:06:52.720
2015.

300

00:06:52.720  -->  00:06:52.730

301

00:06:52.730  -->  00:06:56.320
Ok so that that's looking better now,

302

00:06:56.320  -->  00:06:56.330

303

00:06:56.330  -->  00:07:00.940
these over here name, we need to change

304

00:07:00.940  -->  00:07:00.950

305

00:07:00.950  -->  00:07:04.510
that. So let's go to this sheet or

306

00:07:04.510  -->  00:07:04.520

307

00:07:04.520  -->  00:07:06.640
basically any sheet and change name to

308

00:07:06.640  -->  00:07:06.650

309

00:07:06.650  -->  00:07:09.250
come

310

00:07:09.250  -->  00:07:09.260

311

00:07:09.260  -->  00:07:16.150
rename let's call it, let's call it a

312

00:07:16.150  -->  00:07:16.160

313

00:07:16.160  -->  00:07:24.880
start-up ok and now what else we want?

314

00:07:24.880  -->  00:07:24.890

315

00:07:24.890  -->  00:07:27.400
Our growth so we want to change this

316

00:07:27.400  -->  00:07:27.410

317

00:07:27.410  -->  00:07:29.950
let's change growth

318

00:07:29.950  -->  00:07:29.960

319

00:07:29.960  -->  00:07:31.630
let's change the title or before we do

320

00:07:31.630  -->  00:07:31.640

321

00:07:31.640  -->  00:07:34.030
let's change these as well as so we want

322

00:07:34.030  -->  00:07:34.040

323

00:07:34.040  -->  00:07:36.160
them to be tens as well. So we'll go

324

00:07:36.160  -->  00:07:36.170

325

00:07:36.170  -->  00:07:42.610
format font and make it 10 but the

326

00:07:42.610  -->  00:07:42.620

327

00:07:42.620  -->  00:07:48.790
heading, let's go here and actually we'll

328

00:07:48.790  -->  00:07:48.800

329

00:07:48.800  -->  00:07:50.050
look at me like that will change the

330

00:07:50.050  -->  00:07:50.060

331

00:07:50.060  -->  00:07:52.660
heading here so growth we want to

332

00:07:52.660  -->  00:07:52.670

333

00:07:52.670  -->  00:07:57.280
replace that with top then this is a

334

00:07:57.280  -->  00:07:57.290

335

00:07:57.290  -->  00:08:01.720
like a trick so star again we want to

336

00:08:01.720  -->  00:08:01.730

337

00:08:01.730  -->  00:08:04.240
put it a value that changes in here so

338

00:08:04.240  -->  00:08:04.250

339

00:08:04.250  -->  00:08:06.970
we'll put our parameter will put leaders

340

00:08:06.970  -->  00:08:06.980

341

00:08:06.980  -->  00:08:12.070
and then by growth make this all arial

342

00:08:12.070  -->  00:08:12.080

343

00:08:12.080  -->  00:08:16.660
and make it a because it is a heading, so

344

00:08:16.660  -->  00:08:16.670

345

00:08:16.670  -->  00:08:20.140
make it 12 and make it bold.

346

00:08:20.140  -->  00:08:20.150

347

00:08:20.150  -->  00:08:22.000
Ok so as you can see as I change this

348

00:08:22.000  -->  00:08:22.010

349

00:08:22.010  -->  00:08:25.930
parameter, the name of this sheet changes

350

00:08:25.930  -->  00:08:25.940

351

00:08:25.940  -->  00:08:29.920
which is good which rows connects the

352

00:08:29.920  -->  00:08:29.930

353

00:08:29.930  -->  00:08:31.690
two so they can see as you're changing

354

00:08:31.690  -->  00:08:31.700

355

00:08:31.700  -->  00:08:34.270
this is changing which is great. Now

356

00:08:34.270  -->  00:08:34.280

357

00:08:34.280  -->  00:08:38.350
let's edit the parameters right so we

358

00:08:38.350  -->  00:08:38.360

359

00:08:38.360  -->  00:08:42.969
need to change their fonts so for my

360

00:08:42.969  -->  00:08:42.979

361

00:08:42.979  -->  00:08:47.040
parameters change this to a 12 as well

362

00:08:47.040  -->  00:08:47.050

363

00:08:47.050  -->  00:08:49.740
make it bold. Okay, so they're kind of all

364

00:08:49.740  -->  00:08:49.750

365

00:08:49.750  -->  00:08:52.769
the same make sure it's ariel is good so

366

00:08:52.769  -->  00:08:52.779

367

00:08:52.779  -->  00:08:56.880
it's consistent when you look down this

368

00:08:56.880  -->  00:08:56.890

369

00:08:56.890  -->  00:09:01.710
way. Now, we want to format the how the

370

00:09:01.710  -->  00:09:01.720

371

00:09:01.720  -->  00:09:05.250
values are represented here so let's go

372

00:09:05.250  -->  00:09:05.260

373

00:09:05.260  -->  00:09:06.240
ahead because this is too much

374

00:09:06.240  -->  00:09:06.250

375

00:09:06.250  -->  00:09:08.009
information people don't need to know

376

00:09:08.009  -->  00:09:08.019

377

00:09:08.019  -->  00:09:09.990
that it's eight million something

378

00:09:09.990  -->  00:09:10.000

379

00:09:10.000  -->  00:09:12.329
thousand and something dollars.

380

00:09:12.329  -->  00:09:12.339

381

00:09:12.339  -->  00:09:14.310
Let's edit parameter right-click

382

00:09:14.310  -->  00:09:14.320

383

00:09:14.320  -->  00:09:16.710
parameter and leave is an integer

384

00:09:16.710  -->  00:09:16.720

385

00:09:16.720  -->  00:09:20.340
display currency and let's make it

386

00:09:20.340  -->  00:09:20.350

387

00:09:20.350  -->  00:09:22.650
millions and only one decimal point that

388

00:09:22.650  -->  00:09:22.660

389

00:09:22.660  -->  00:09:24.420
should be sufficient totally sufficient

390

00:09:24.420  -->  00:09:24.430

391

00:09:24.430  -->  00:09:31.350
same thing here, edit parameter current

392

00:09:31.350  -->  00:09:31.360

393

00:09:31.360  -->  00:09:37.259
value so no currency millions.

394

00:09:37.259  -->  00:09:37.269

395

00:09:37.269  -->  00:09:41.310
Okay that looks good yes so now when I

396

00:09:41.310  -->  00:09:41.320

397

00:09:41.320  -->  00:09:43.620
change it it's changing in millions much

398

00:09:43.620  -->  00:09:43.630

399

00:09:43.630  -->  00:09:47.069
much better.

400

00:09:47.069  -->  00:09:47.079

401

00:09:47.079  -->  00:09:49.560
Alright so that's done ok so let's add

402

00:09:49.560  -->  00:09:49.570

403

00:09:49.570  -->  00:09:52.800
some more powerful features to this

404

00:09:52.800  -->  00:09:52.810

405

00:09:52.810  -->  00:09:55.350
dashboard. There's three things are going

406

00:09:55.350  -->  00:09:55.360

407

00:09:55.360  -->  00:09:56.970
to add we're going to add reference

408

00:09:56.970  -->  00:09:56.980

409

00:09:56.980  -->  00:09:59.610
lines drop lines and we're going to fix

410

00:09:59.610  -->  00:09:59.620

411

00:09:59.620  -->  00:10:03.420
up the tooltip ok so let's start with

412

00:10:03.420  -->  00:10:03.430

413

00:10:03.430  -->  00:10:05.130
the reference lines because they're the

414

00:10:05.130  -->  00:10:05.140

415

00:10:05.140  -->  00:10:10.050
coolest. If we right-click on revenue and

416

00:10:10.050  -->  00:10:10.060

417

00:10:10.060  -->  00:10:13.769
we click add reference line then so we

418

00:10:13.769  -->  00:10:13.779

419

00:10:13.779  -->  00:10:15.300
want to basically a vertical line which

420

00:10:15.300  -->  00:10:15.310

421

00:10:15.310  -->  00:10:17.010
will tell us exactly where the cutoff

422

00:10:17.010  -->  00:10:17.020

423

00:10:17.020  -->  00:10:19.199
point is so to add that line we're going

424

00:10:19.199  -->  00:10:19.209

425

00:10:19.209  -->  00:10:23.610
to say instead of line here we're going

426

00:10:23.610  -->  00:10:23.620

427

00:10:23.620  -->  00:10:27.750
to select the revenue cut off the

428

00:10:27.750  -->  00:10:27.760

429

00:10:27.760  -->  00:10:29.819
parameter and as you can see the lines

430

00:10:29.819  -->  00:10:29.829

431

00:10:29.829  -->  00:10:31.680
appear already and instead of label

432

00:10:31.680  -->  00:10:31.690

433

00:10:31.690  -->  00:10:33.060
which is over here we're going to say

434

00:10:33.060  -->  00:10:33.070

435

00:10:33.070  -->  00:10:35.069
instead of computation against a value,

436

00:10:35.069  -->  00:10:35.079

437

00:10:35.079  -->  00:10:37.980
click OK. Now same thing for the expenses

438

00:10:37.980  -->  00:10:37.990

439

00:10:37.990  -->  00:10:43.590
edit axis, oops, add reference line and

440

00:10:43.590  -->  00:10:43.600

441

00:10:43.600  -->  00:10:47.550
we're going to say expenses cut off and

442

00:10:47.550  -->  00:10:47.560

443

00:10:47.560  -->  00:10:49.019
we're going to say value.

444

00:10:49.019  -->  00:10:49.029

445

00:10:49.029  -->  00:10:51.900
Okay so look watch how cool this is if

446

00:10:51.900  -->  00:10:51.910

447

00:10:51.910  -->  00:10:56.340
now I change these the not only the

448

00:10:56.340  -->  00:10:56.350

449

00:10:56.350  -->  00:10:58.980
colors change but also the quadrant you

450

00:10:58.980  -->  00:10:58.990

451

00:10:58.990  -->  00:11:00.480
can actually visually see how the

452

00:11:00.480  -->  00:11:00.490

453

00:11:00.490  -->  00:11:03.090
quadrant is changing and that is very

454

00:11:03.090  -->  00:11:03.100

455

00:11:03.100  -->  00:11:04.260
powerful,

456

00:11:04.260  -->  00:11:04.270

457

00:11:04.270  -->  00:11:06.930
so you can see the quadrant itself over

458

00:11:06.930  -->  00:11:06.940

459

00:11:06.940  -->  00:11:10.530
here that has the lines cross. Ok now we

460

00:11:10.530  -->  00:11:10.540

461

00:11:10.540  -->  00:11:12.840
want to add a drop line. so when I click

462

00:11:12.840  -->  00:11:12.850

463

00:11:12.850  -->  00:11:14.370
on a so if they're interested in this

464

00:11:14.370  -->  00:11:14.380

465

00:11:14.380  -->  00:11:15.269
company

466

00:11:15.269  -->  00:11:15.279

467

00:11:15.279  -->  00:11:17.490
what they don't know it's kind of hard

468

00:11:17.490  -->  00:11:17.500

469

00:11:17.500  -->  00:11:19.470
to see where the revenue falls. Let's

470

00:11:19.470  -->  00:11:19.480

471

00:11:19.480  -->  00:11:21.090
help them with that let's right click

472

00:11:21.090  -->  00:11:21.100

473

00:11:21.100  -->  00:11:23.819
click drop lines show drop lines and now

474

00:11:23.819  -->  00:11:23.829

475

00:11:23.829  -->  00:11:25.949
whenever you click on something the drop

476

00:11:25.949  -->  00:11:25.959

477

00:11:25.959  -->  00:11:28.769
lines will guide your eyes to see where

478

00:11:28.769  -->  00:11:28.779

479

00:11:28.779  -->  00:11:31.350
exactly the revenue falls.

480

00:11:31.350  -->  00:11:31.360

481

00:11:31.360  -->  00:11:35.340
Ok that's interesting, ok so now one more

482

00:11:35.340  -->  00:11:35.350

483

00:11:35.350  -->  00:11:37.260
thing that we have left to do is the

484

00:11:37.260  -->  00:11:37.270

485

00:11:37.270  -->  00:11:39.600
tooltip. So you see how this tool tip is

486

00:11:39.600  -->  00:11:39.610

487

00:11:39.610  -->  00:11:42.600
floating around and it's not formatted

488

00:11:42.600  -->  00:11:42.610

489

00:11:42.610  -->  00:11:44.760
and doesn't have the correct it doesn't

490

00:11:44.760  -->  00:11:44.770

491

00:11:44.770  -->  00:11:47.040
have the best information could and also

492

00:11:47.040  -->  00:11:47.050

493

00:11:47.050  -->  00:11:49.920
here like we don't need a tooltip at

494

00:11:49.920  -->  00:11:49.930

495

00:11:49.930  -->  00:11:50.220
all.

496

00:11:50.220  -->  00:11:50.230

497

00:11:50.230  -->  00:11:52.050
So if we click on that and we go to

498

00:11:52.050  -->  00:11:52.060

499

00:11:52.060  -->  00:11:55.050
worksheet and we select tool tip it

500

00:11:55.050  -->  00:11:55.060

501

00:11:55.060  -->  00:11:57.120
brings up the tooltip for that sheet and

502

00:11:57.120  -->  00:11:57.130

503

00:11:57.130  -->  00:11:59.130
we don't want the tooltip at all, click OK

504

00:11:59.130  -->  00:11:59.140

505

00:11:59.140  -->  00:12:01.380
and now you can see there's no tip. Now

506

00:12:01.380  -->  00:12:01.390

507

00:12:01.390  -->  00:12:03.269
this tool tip is useful but we need to

508

00:12:03.269  -->  00:12:03.279

509

00:12:03.279  -->  00:12:05.250
change its content so let's go to the

510

00:12:05.250  -->  00:12:05.260

511

00:12:05.260  -->  00:12:09.090
sheet and let's see what we want in here

512

00:12:09.090  -->  00:12:09.100

513

00:12:09.100  -->  00:12:11.490
so we want the name of the company

514

00:12:11.490  -->  00:12:11.500

515

00:12:11.500  -->  00:12:13.860
alright so startup let's put it in

516

00:12:13.860  -->  00:12:13.870

517

00:12:13.870  -->  00:12:15.540
detail so then we can use it in the

518

00:12:15.540  -->  00:12:15.550

519

00:12:15.550  -->  00:12:17.730
tooltip. So if I go to the tooltip here,

520

00:12:17.730  -->  00:12:17.740

521

00:12:17.740  -->  00:12:20.069
you'll see I'm just going to get rid of

522

00:12:20.069  -->  00:12:20.079

523

00:12:20.079  -->  00:12:22.769
everything if I insert from here you can

524

00:12:22.769  -->  00:12:22.779

525

00:12:22.779  -->  00:12:24.240
only insert the things that are actually

526

00:12:24.240  -->  00:12:24.250

527

00:12:24.250  -->  00:12:27.000
present on your worksheet, so you see I

528

00:12:27.000  -->  00:12:27.010

529

00:12:27.010  -->  00:12:29.189
had to start up I can use startup. Now

530

00:12:29.189  -->  00:12:29.199

531

00:12:29.199  -->  00:12:30.930
what else do we want? We want the

532

00:12:30.930  -->  00:12:30.940

533

00:12:30.940  -->  00:12:33.750
industry, we want as soon as the people

534

00:12:33.750  -->  00:12:33.760

535

00:12:33.760  -->  00:12:37.500
or the more an executive put some the

536

00:12:37.500  -->  00:12:37.510

537

00:12:37.510  -->  00:12:39.720
mouse over it they want to find out the

538

00:12:39.720  -->  00:12:39.730

539

00:12:39.730  -->  00:12:43.139
name, the industry what else when it was

540

00:12:43.139  -->  00:12:43.149

541

00:12:43.149  -->  00:12:47.040
founded what grow food had in

542

00:12:47.040  -->  00:12:47.050

543

00:12:47.050  -->  00:12:52.590
2015? What else? And their description so

544

00:12:52.590  -->  00:12:52.600

545

00:12:52.600  -->  00:12:54.030
we've got a description here.

546

00:12:54.030  -->  00:12:54.040

547

00:12:54.040  -->  00:12:56.280
So let's go ahead and now fix up this

548

00:12:56.280  -->  00:12:56.290

549

00:12:56.290  -->  00:12:59.790
tool tip. There it is,

550

00:12:59.790  -->  00:12:59.800

551

00:12:59.800  -->  00:13:03.449
so get rid of everything and first thing

552

00:13:03.449  -->  00:13:03.459

553

00:13:03.459  -->  00:13:05.790
we're going to add and actually tooltips

554

00:13:05.790  -->  00:13:05.800

555

00:13:05.800  -->  00:13:08.249
being good with tooltips is a whole art

556

00:13:08.249  -->  00:13:08.259

557

00:13:08.259  -->  00:13:12.360
form, if you gotta, you gotta be able to

558

00:13:12.360  -->  00:13:12.370

559

00:13:12.370  -->  00:13:14.790
format them nicely because people rely

560

00:13:14.790  -->  00:13:14.800

561

00:13:14.800  -->  00:13:17.400
on them heavily sometimes so start up

562

00:13:17.400  -->  00:13:17.410

563

00:13:17.410  -->  00:13:20.309
and we're going to is involved that's

564

00:13:20.309  -->  00:13:20.319

565

00:13:20.319  -->  00:13:22.949
good let's leave it like that then we're

566

00:13:22.949  -->  00:13:22.959

567

00:13:22.959  -->  00:13:25.170
going to say industry so which industry

568

00:13:25.170  -->  00:13:25.180

569

00:13:25.180  -->  00:13:29.759
did that company come from industry then

570

00:13:29.759  -->  00:13:29.769

571

00:13:29.769  -->  00:13:32.910
we've got the year when it was founded

572

00:13:32.910  -->  00:13:32.920

573

00:13:32.920  -->  00:13:38.850
then let's say growth in 2015 and

574

00:13:38.850  -->  00:13:38.860

575

00:13:38.860  -->  00:13:42.480
finally let's look at a description.

576

00:13:42.480  -->  00:13:42.490

577

00:13:42.490  -->  00:13:46.379
So if I click ok now, tooltip is just awful

578

00:13:46.379  -->  00:13:46.389

579

00:13:46.389  -->  00:13:47.610
horrible.

580

00:13:47.610  -->  00:13:47.620

581

00:13:47.620  -->  00:13:50.340
