00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.200
in this year,

00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:06.350
we're going to take a look at how we can create a user or a group with certain privileges

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:11.570
so that we can have a set off users who will have restricted access to the database.

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:13.050
For example,

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.360
we may restrict the user.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.850
Teoh only view the content in the database,

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:24.700
but he may not be able to create New Table or be able to create a new database,

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:25.650
etcetera.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:26.870
On the other hand,

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:30.150
we can also have users with exclusive access.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.480
For example,

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.790
the super user pose Greece,

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:35.250
which we've been using so far.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:41.260
He has access to all the elements in the database and has all the privileges to perform any

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.120
operation on the database.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.590
He can even go ahead and create a new users like we're about to do now,

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:53.150
basically the concept of similar to creating users in an operating system.

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.900
Certain users will have certain privileges,

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.000
while other users will have exclusive access.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.580
Consider the example off windows,

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:02.460
for instance,

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.340
an administrator can actually do anything on the open system.

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:07.010
For example,

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.910
installing a software etcetera and a standard user,

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:11.940
on the other hand,

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.940
will have certain restrictions.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:14.970
For example,

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.350
he cannot install and new software on the operating system.

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.060
So let's see how we can create a user.

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.050
We're actually going to see how we can create a role.

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.100
Well,

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.350
impose grass cure.

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.750
Creating a role means creating a user or a group.

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:34.900
First.

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.450
Let's take a look at how we can create a user.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.750
So you click this and then you get this reserved.

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.030
He would provide some name to the user,

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.890
for example,

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.950
on when to call it new user.

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.790
The definition is where the passport goes.

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.760
You can also said the account expiry date,

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:54.970
if you would wish so.

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:55.700
Basically,

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.040
after the expiry date,

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.750
the user cannot log in.

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:04.950
You can also said the limit on number of simultaneous connections that this user can log in

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.330
minus one,

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.250
meaning he can have unlimited simultaneous sessions.

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.790
Privileges is a section where you would provide all the privileges to this user.

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:20.670
And one thing that you need to make sure is to turn this on here to make sure that can

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.090
Logan is set to Yes,

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.150
only then whatever we're creating will be considered as a user.

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.650
If you turn this off,

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:34.450
then this is actually like creating a group which will talk about in a minute or two.

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.520
So make sure that you turn this on and you can set some privileges.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.090
For example,

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:41.410
you can let the user create.

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.050
Other users are create rolls just as we're doing right now,

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.350
but I want to leave it to know.

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:55.360
And I also don't want this user to be a super user who would have the exclusive access and

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.290
membership of the section,

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.700
which will talk about once we talk about creating groups.

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.480
You'll understand better.

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.000
The panel middle section is actually little advanced,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.280
and we're definitely no need to worry about it too much.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.590
Basically,

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.850
this has something to do when you're trying to make changes to an existing role or user.

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:17.910
Similarly,

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.490
security is something we're least bothered about.

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:23.950
We don't have to set the security labels.

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.850
So here is this cure that gets executed.

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.160
This is essentially what we're doing with this resort.

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.200
So you would say,

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:43.300
create user and followed by all these keywords you can refer to the documentation in the

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.970
official pose,

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.040
agrees website this type and create user,

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:52.270
and you're able to find the entire documentation there where you get to know list of other

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:53.650
terms of chicken use.

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:58.340
So no super user means that we didn't said this,

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.490
too.

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:59.180
Yes,

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.050
so he's not a super user.

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:02.670
If you said this,

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.980
yes,

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.180
you will see it getting reflected here as well.

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:15.210
So that's undo it and click Save This has created the user new user.

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:18.620
Now let's see what he's able to do now.

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.440
In order to log in with this user,

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.630
he could either do it from PG admin.

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:23.260
Oh,

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.550
are the skill show,

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.750
So let's tryto do it from here first.

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.210
For the right of us,

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:35.890
disconnect from the silver directly.

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:39.510
Call it click on Properties in Connection.

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:40.250
You would change.

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:43.750
They use the name to the new user,

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.150
click Save and then try to connect back.

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:51.310
It's going down the password into the password.

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:51.810
In my case,

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:52.940
it's a SDF.

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:53.830
I'll click.

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:54.550
OK,

00:04:54.550 --> 00:05:01.980
let's see if this user has the privilege to access the data inside tables.

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:02.860
For instance,

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.000
how dry?

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.980
Click on it and go to view at the data.

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:13.040
All rose and you would notice that permission is denied.

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:17.250
Let's try to do the same thing from the SQL show.

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:30.250
I went to say they use the name is new user password is going to be as DF select star from

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:31.660
students.

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:37.830
It says relations students does not exist.

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:39.510
Even there is existing.

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:41.560
This user is not about access it.

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.350
So let's see what we can do here.

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:50.130
Let's say that I wanted to give this user access to students table only and not other

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:50.850
tables.

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:53.180
Let's see how we go about doing that.

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:56.880
Let me just disconnect from the server again.

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:00.450
And that's log in with our super user pose greaser.

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:04.690
But the connection I went to suppose,

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:06.750
agree user,

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:09.070
and I'll try to reconnect.

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:16.820
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to give grand taxes.

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:25.310
So this user on the particular table But before that went to give him access to this schema

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:25.310
.

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:30.750
Now the scheme of that I talked about in one of the videos explaining the structure off a

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:33.020
table or the database Well,

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:34.510
this game is little different.

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:37.800
What you're seeing here is called the physical schema,

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:43.110
the Eskimo that were talked about going through the word document is a logical scheme,

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:45.430
and that describes the entire database structure,

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:46.990
but they're off tables.

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:51.820
So here's a scheme with the various objects in it like we have tables,

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:52.650
functions,

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:56.680
etcetera will try to explore some of these incoming videos anyway.

00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:00.290
So let's right Click on this public is Ah,

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:04.640
scheme and and click properties go to security.

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:10.470
It is where you would grant the privileges to the user if you notice the post great user is

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:13.270
already having privilege on the schema.

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:22.290
So let's add however new user as well and you to click on this privileges and you can

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:27.470
either you create usage or all access.

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:30.050
I'm going to give him all access for the time being.

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:36.850
Are you could just a stick to usage anything that you think is appropriate.

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:38.150
Click save.

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:39.550
No.

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:46.450
There are two ways where you can grant access to the students table for this user.

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:50.720
You could aid the do it from here directly from students table.

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:52.050
Let me show it this way.

00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:52.550
First,

00:07:52.550 --> 00:08:01.410
who into click properties and you go to security in here was Greece is already existing.

00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:02.680
So similar.

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:02.900
Go,

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:03.480
Dad,

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:07.180
How user New user privileges.

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:12.850
And here you would select what are all things that he is privileged to do on the stable.

00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:18.570
I would like to let him do only the select operation and nothing else.

00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:25.080
He may not be able to do restaurant the operations that's click save and it's done.

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:26.650
We can no actually access.

00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:27.250
I mean,

00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:30.560
the user can actually now access this student stable,

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:35.790
whose in the select query and the other way that I was talking about that you can do is by

00:08:35.790 --> 00:08:39.720
taking on this parent object of tables.

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:43.420
And then you go to Grant reserved here.

00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:49.550
He would get to choose all the objects that are reciting as part of this table's section,

00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:52.550
and you can choose the table click next,

00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:55.030
and everything is same.

00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:58.630
Grand is going to be the new user privileges you can select,

00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:01.590
whatever the privileges that you wish to view.

00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:03.940
I went to close it because we've already done that.

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:04.870
Alternatively,

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:07.650
can also right click on the data basis again.

00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:12.830
I'm sorry is supposed to click on the database in which you would like to hello the

00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:13.640
privileges again.

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:16.280
You would click the Grand Wizard here.

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:20.270
You get to choose the one of these objects.

00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:23.400
When you access the grand wizard off a database,

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:26.450
you would have objects at a broader level.

00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:28.850
So not only do we see the tables,

00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:31.590
but also other objects like functions,

00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:34.070
etcetera and rest.

00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:35.350
Always going to be seen.

00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:37.040
All right,

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:37.900
I'm going to close it.

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:41.040
So the state taxes the table?

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:42.050
No.

00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:44.470
And sure enough,

00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:45.680
we're able to access it.

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:47.110
No state taxes,

00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:52.350
the other table to which this user is not having right.

00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:58.250
Let's try to access course table and the permission is denied.

00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:00.650
So that's how it's going to work.

00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:01.580
We can give.

00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:04.260
Restrict our access to the users.

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:08.440
Let's quickly talk about the groups,

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:12.860
so creating group is essentially similar to creating a user,

00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:16.060
which is by using this role wizard.

00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:18.660
But the only difference is as have all the dimension.

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:23.650
We just have to make sure that you not enable this this time because we want to create a

00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:24.150
role.

00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:26.140
I'm going to give some name,

00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:27.350
new role,

00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:28.470
etcetera,

00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:32.660
with some privileges and again religious are just not restricted to these.

00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:35.810
We can also set privileges at object level,

00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:37.500
just as they demonstrated,

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:43.680
and the membership part would essentially let you add all the existing groups.

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:44.500
For example,

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:47.070
if I add this couple of groups,

00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:50.170
what are all the privileges that are defined in this?

00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:56.100
Groups will be applicable under group that I'm creating or the rule that I'm creating,

00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:57.750
whatever you call it,

00:10:57.750 --> 00:10:59.610
And in addition to that,

00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:01.860
it can also have your own privileges.

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:04.750
So that's where this membership would come into picture.

00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:11.900
So once you create the membership and this is how the SQL is going to look like and if you

00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:12.430
know what is this?

00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:13.100
Diamonds Ralph,

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:13.830
create user.

00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:18.250
This is create role and look at the state and dance.

00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:22.950
Will we grant these two roles to new role?

00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:26.670
So we are sort off allocating all these privileges off.

00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:26.940
This,

00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:27.400
too.

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:35.020
Groups are roles to this new role who that's not confusing and you click Save that would

00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:36.070
create a new role.

00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:36.770
And,

00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:36.950
no,

00:11:36.950 --> 00:11:39.850
you can actually create new users.

00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:43.150
By enabling this,

00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:45.000
you would give some name.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:45.760
This time,

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:51.730
you can just simply add that mural has a membership so that this year's will now have the

00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:56.250
privileges set for this particular membership that's get canceled.

00:11:56.250 --> 00:11:57.740
So that's how it goes.

00:11:57.740 --> 00:11:58.930
It's wonderful,

00:11:58.930 --> 00:11:59.390
isn't it?

00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:01.290
Hope that makes sense.

00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:02.850
See you in my next radio
