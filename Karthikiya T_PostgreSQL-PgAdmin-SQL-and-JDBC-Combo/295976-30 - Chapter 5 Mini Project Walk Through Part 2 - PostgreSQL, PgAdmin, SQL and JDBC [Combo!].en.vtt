00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.830
All right,

00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:01.710
let's continue.

00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:04.730
Let's talk about the headed behavior.

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:06.550
So once you click this button,

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:09.010
look what's being passed from here,

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:14.210
observed the euro that is getting displayed on the bottom left corner.

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:15.580
But Jules,

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:16.350
this said it.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.640
It's going to say I D 68 which corresponds to this student.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:22.300
Similarly,

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.240
if I hope for my mouth on some of the student,

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.660
the I D is changing.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:28.820
So basically,

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.880
this competent is actually a bear off the data that gets displayed in it.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.750
So let's see what's going to happen when I click edit for one of these students.

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.250
Let's I want to edit this first guy bell.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:43.950
I went to click him.

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:50.570
Do take a note on the perimeters that are being sent the euro para meters when his task,

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:51.980
which is it's edit.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:58.750
In 1964 I click this and I'm taking to this page and behind the scenes.

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.040
Those two para meters will help us navigate to that page.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:08.550
So let's go to our soul let and here in our switch gears you would see edit.

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:14.730
And that would just simply get this student from the database,

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:20.360
storing it in this new object and Then we're setting a request,

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.980
a tribute with the name student,

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:31.230
and later we're forwarding the request to a new page at its student dot jsp page using the

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:32.550
request dispatcher.

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.100
So once we go here,

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.740
this is suggested page.

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.580
Where will be navigated?

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:45.090
We're checking to see if the student para meter is now or not.

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.850
If it is not know,

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.530
that means we are indebted page.

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.250
So we have said that Param Eter in here before editing that particular user.

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:01.230
And the interesting thing about this page is that we're trying to use the same JSP page for

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:05.170
both add or insert as well lasts for a day.

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.110
But we're having these conditions.

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:10.410
The if conditions.

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.320
If the student details are populated,

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:20.310
that means we have pressed edit because that's when we're trying to provided this.

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.360
Attribute their cost,

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.870
attribute verses in ad.

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.450
We're not providing anything of that sort.

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.780
So we have all those fields here to fill in the name,

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.050
age and description,

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.930
and we're going to perform.

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:37.640
Submit it.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:44.270
I'm going to change his name to is DF and age to 34 description to something else.

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:46.670
And when I click this button,

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.010
add or update.

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.590
What actually going to happen is not only are we submitting all these details,

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.230
but also we have a few hidden fields.

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.500
When his i d which we don't want to change,

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.110
we want Daddy to remain same for the same student.

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.580
So we made that hidden.

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.390
It won't be visible to the user,

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:12.380
but this will be submitted as part off form request and will be sent to the Soviet.

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:13.480
Similarly,

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.250
we have another input field,

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:23.220
but very simple value update in gets off head it and in case off insert,

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.880
this is going to be insert.

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:30.880
We're going to use this to in our soul it and do something with it.

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:38.080
So let's good or so let So what made Just click this button and make sure see,

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.290
it got reflected with the same I d that I didn't change.

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.950
But all these details are changed for that student.

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:52.350
So you know are so let here we have it update.

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:54.490
So I'm going to go to this method.

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:59.610
All I'm doing here is unjust trying to read all the form details that are submitted,

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.350
including the idea which was a hidden field,

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:08.000
and then I'm trying to create a new student object and I'm feeling it to this method of

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.850
great student.

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:10.560
The update student,

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.030
as we have looked at,

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:18.250
will have this ah SQL statement that would update that particular record in the database.

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.170
So once you do that,

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:28.190
we're just simply navigating to that soul it that would render a fresh list off students.

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:38.650
It's as simple as that and insert would pretty much work the same way even Dad,

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:43.680
some details and sage to be 32 description.

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.510
And when you click add,

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:52.830
you would see that new student getting populated with a new identify air and to see how it

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:53.230
works.

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:54.790
We've already talked about it.

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:57.930
So instead of update in here,

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:05.960
the hidden feel is going to populate insert as a task with all the new store in details and

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.310
then from this section,

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:13.680
Inter student were trained to again create a new object student object using the

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:20.060
information that were submitted and then we just simply saying in such student and this

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:28.170
method will again have that Eskil statement along with this placeholders which were using

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:33.960
ah depopulate the relevant data later point of time in and we're sort of inserting that

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:38.830
student information in the table and same gets reflected,

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:40.050
in our view,

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:42.040
very simple.

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:46.400
So that's about the simple application.

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:52.720
The idea off walking you through this many project is to get your sense off how the real

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:59.130
World Model view controller application works and have also demonstrated all the database

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:04.190
operations that you would have a perform the crowd operations on the student table.

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:05.890
Actually,

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:07.370
when you start writing the code,

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:08.910
he would face challenges.

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:11.350
So I would recommend that you not just listen to me,

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:15.530
but rather go ahead and try to do the same on your own.

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:17.650
And then you will have someone.

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:18.850
The flight challenges,

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:22.600
which you can then debug and learn from it,

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:24.950
holds it sort off things.

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:30.650
Also one thing that I would mention that you better not special this para meters in the

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:31.360
cell vit.

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:39.520
Let these perimeters go inside the deployment descriptor and read these para meters from

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:41.040
the deployment descriptor.

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:45.160
That's a good practice because two more if you'd like to switch to another database,

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:45.700
let's say,

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:52.220
then you have to change this euro inside the soul it But whereas if you put it outside in

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:53.450
the Web dot xml.

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:59.700
Then you can just simply update the XML without having to edit the actual job decor and

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:00.450
then compile it,

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:02.520
build it and then deploy the application.

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:05.650
So maybe a list pause the video,

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:10.840
make those that it's and show you how it works and that we will have a complete,

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:13.550
full fledged satisfying application.

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:21.540
So I've created this file web dot xml under the ribbon of directory and then I populated

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:23.050
with the falling content.

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:26.000
These are set off context para meters.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.240
Best qualities are digital busy pal emitters.

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:36.110
What we had in our So let I moved them to hear and then from So let I'm actually going to

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:41.850
read the same from the web dot xml and rest all remains same.

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:44.670
So now at later point off time,

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:46.790
if you want to switch to a different database,

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:52.130
you can just simply upgrade this para meters and point to a different jar specific toe.

00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:56.050
That new database you don't have to mess with the source cord.

00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:58.580
Hope that makes sense.

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:00.180
See you soon
