00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.360
okay in this,

00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:01.560
really,

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:06.530
we're going to talk about constraints will also take a look at how we can create this

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:08.990
constraint from PG admin,

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:12.250
as well as using structured query language,

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:14.230
Primary key and the Foreign Keys,

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.350
something that were already aware off We've taken Look at one such example.

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.840
But what's new are these three constraints,

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.040
most of which is not.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.950
Know what simply means when you specify this,

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:28.240
not null key word.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:29.640
Along with the attribute.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:30.850
When you create the table,

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:36.150
then you can't have an empty value or another value in this field.

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:41.000
You must and should provide some value off the data time that respectful here.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.640
In this case,

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.050
it's text the unique constraint.

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.040
You can specify it.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.970
This does you did here When you do so,

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:55.150
you can't have the same value entered twice for this column.

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:56.940
And it's logical.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:57.540
For example,

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:58.350
in this case,

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.920
you can't have two similar email addresses,

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.190
so we can put this constant saying that it should be unique.

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:06.440
Then,

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.630
when you're trying to insert an email ID,

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:09.940
which is all that existing,

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.350
either accidentally or intentionally,

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.250
it won't allow you to do so,

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:20.520
and then we have the check constraint very can specify your own condition.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.070
Or,

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.970
in other words,

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:27.050
what are the value that you put it must satisfy the following condition.

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.250
So in here I'm saying,

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.270
What are the value that is being entered in this field fee?

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.980
I'm going to check to see if it is less than this number.

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:42.750
Only then will I allow the insert statement to work.

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:43.700
All right,

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.800
let's take a look at an example in our example.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.000
This is essentially what we're going to do.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.050
We're going to have a student stable,

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.490
and the idea column is going to act like a primary key.

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.560
Will also have the course table,

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.650
which will have the list of courses.

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.600
And I do feel is going to be its primary key,

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.000
which will have unique numbers that would,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.450
uniquely,

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:06.840
I didn't for each and every Joe.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:13.590
And in order to map these two tables or to create the relation between these two tables

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.310
were having the student course table,

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.620
which essentially contained two fields,

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.300
each of which corresponds to the primary key off these two tables in here,

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.450
which means we're using the foreign key.

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.450
This is a foreign Guelph students table and this is a foreign key off the course table,

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:38.240
and then we're able to map its many to many relationship because if you take a look at this

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.240
,

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.060
we have the same student registering for multiple courses.

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.740
Similarly,

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:49.470
the same course can be registered the multiple students as well women to just take a look

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.750
at it.

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.760
So let's go to P J admin and see how we can create this.

00:02:53.760 --> 00:03:01.280
Tables with constraints have already created this tables,

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.350
but let me create them again just to show you how they work.

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:06.440
So you right,

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:07.580
click on the tables,

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.900
create and then click table.

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.990
You would specify their name off the table.

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.480
First,

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.810
let's create the students table students,

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:23.130
and I'm going to say temp because this is temporary table I'm creating just for

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.310
demonstration purpose.

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:31.570
And then you can go ahead and add the columns that you wanted to be part of the stable.

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:34.300
I want to give it some name.

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:41.150
Let's call it I D or identify data type is going to be in Teacher.

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.450
You can select the one from this list.

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:51.650
I'm also going to introduce another column which will be student name,

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:56.450
and this is going to be off from text.

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:03.260
Another column would say E mail I d.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:10.950
And this is going to be It's going to be a text as ville or whatever you would specify.

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.540
And if you go to the SQL section,

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.850
you would see whatever we're doing here,

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.750
its corresponding a skill is getting generated.

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:26.300
So if you want to do whatever we're doing,

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:27.320
the creating columns,

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:28.000
etcetera,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.670
then this is how the SQL statement would look like.

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:32.100
Now.

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:33.450
This is pretty formal.

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:34.670
The presentation of SQL.

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:35.380
Typically,

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:38.250
you don't have to specify the public,

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.050
which is Ah,

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:42.550
the schema.

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:53.440
You also don't need to specify explicitly that the onerous post grease it would

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:54.600
automatically be done.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.190
If you're just run this part off this query,

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:58.910
that would suffice.

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:01.570
But it can always run.

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:04.520
Center quickly yourself if you wish to.

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.950
Let's go ahead and add some constants to the stable.

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:09.280
We want one primary key,

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:10.590
which would be the idea.

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:12.440
Field someone to say.

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:13.060
Well,

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:14.150
click this plus sign.

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:15.920
I went to view some name.

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:20.480
It doesn't matter what name you just to identify this primary key for this table,

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:21.860
um,

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:23.470
some name or whatever,

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:26.250
but what matters is When you click this button,

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:34.640
you would get to choose the column What you want to choose as primary key in the scarce you

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:35.380
can choose.

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:37.610
Any field that makes sense,

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:38.480
obviously,

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:39.140
is going to be I.

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:39.470
D.

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:44.550
You can also choose to fields or three feels whatever is your preference.

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:46.860
And,

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:47.350
ah,

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:48.760
that's all there is to it.

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:55.620
You click save and we have this table we have.

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:56.850
Emailer does field.

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:04.590
Why shouldn't we just put unique constant in that field that's click on properties and go

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:05.760
to constraints?

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:08.150
Look on unique against,

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:13.890
like on this plus sign and the click Whatever name that you want to give you.

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:17.310
Click this and choose the column.

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:18.160
Humility.

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:25.450
We wanted to be unique and click Save all well and good.

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:27.260
Now let's go to quit it,

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:27.700
too,

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:30.670
and insert some data indoor newly created table.

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:38.180
I'm going to say select star from students temp,

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:50.650
empty table and insert into students temp.

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:52.580
What's best for the list?

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:59.600
Off columns do take note that we didn't choose i D to be auto generated.

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:02.690
If you want auto generated values in your I D field,

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:09.130
then it can just go ahead and change the data type of the column and the scales.

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:10.770
You choose cereal,

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:11.970
but you can't choose No,

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:15.650
because you have to do that during the time off creation off the table.

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:22.130
But let's see if we can see that by adding a new column such for cereal,

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:23.330
and you would be able to see it.

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:25.870
So while creating the table,

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:28.580
make sure that you choose cereal and gets.

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:29.380
If you want to auto,

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:32.480
generate the I D field there isn't it,

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:32.910
won't l.

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:32.970
A.

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:38.060
Once after creating the table is that maybe you might have already inserted some values in

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:38.330
your I.

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:42.850
D field so it won't allow us to disturb that.

00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:45.350
Cancel.

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:46.880
Let's do it ourselves.

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:48.360
I'm winding through it.

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:53.750
I d Field student name and email.

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:55.580
I D.

00:07:55.580 --> 00:08:01.070
And values are going to be save.

00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:05.550
One student name is going to be whatever the name,

00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:10.310
obviously some name and the email.

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:10.700
I d.

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:12.440
Some me milady.

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:17.950
Some email at the rate some company dot com.

00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:20.990
Let's end with a semi colon on the query,

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:23.550
and things worked pretty well.

00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:32.650
Now let's do select star from students temp.

00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:35.420
I have five pretty well done.

00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:39.280
Good where the start insert same humility once again,

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:40.350
of course,

00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:43.220
by changing the Heidi to something else,

00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:50.860
and Mets from the query would expect a never because they put a unique constraint in the

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:53.360
email field and it won't allow us hope.

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.010
That's clear Now.

00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:56.980
Let's see how we can create a foreign key.

00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:58.890
So right click on the stables,

00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:04.150
create new table and,

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:04.490
uh,

00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:05.680
you would give some name.

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:12.450
Let's a student underscore course temp.

00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:13.890
We wanted a pill.

00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:17.240
Get this table click on columns.

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:20.550
Have the columns off your choice.

00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:27.500
Let's say our column name is student F.

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:32.250
K stands for foreign key type is going to be off type integer,

00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:39.590
and let's go to constraints and add the foreign key again.

00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:43.250
You can click this plus sign you water the name that you want to give.

00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:45.910
Click on this edit row.

00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:49.370
I can go to columns.

00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:55.830
Choose the column that you wanted to make foreign kindest cause we only have one column,

00:09:55.830 --> 00:09:57.800
so that's only option.

00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:04.400
Available references is where you get to choose the table that you want to point to and our

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:04.620
kids.

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:07.370
It's going to be students and,

00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:07.770
ah,

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:09.880
we'll get to choose one off its column.

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:11.680
And as a good practice.

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:13.940
You always choose the primary key off the table,

00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:16.820
so I d and you need to click.

00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:17.850
This had button,

00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:20.370
so the details will be added.

00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:21.010
Now,

00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:22.570
now we have the foreign key.

00:10:22.570 --> 00:10:24.660
If you want to take a look at their skill,

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:26.150
licked the stamp.

00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:27.440
And,

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:27.780
uh,

00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:29.210
when we talked about the foreign kid,

00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:31.000
this is a sin tax we were talking about.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.620
We're talking about the differences Keyboard,

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:33.930
Richard,

00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:34.650
first ODI,

00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:36.160
foreign table.

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:37.580
And it's primary key.

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:39.150
Pretty straightforward.

00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:40.350
It clicks save,

00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:42.950
and then we have the stable.

00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:49.950
So that's essentially how you go about creating the relations between the tables.

00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:56.650
Using the foreign key constraint so similarly can add the other constraints as well should

00:10:56.650 --> 00:10:58.450
be self explanatory.

00:10:58.450 --> 00:11:05.050
Or maybe let me just quickly show you how we can create the check constraint,

00:11:05.050 --> 00:11:06.760
right?

00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:07.800
Look on the table,

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:10.270
go to properties and then to constraints,

00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:15.950
click on the check constraint had give it some name.

00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:21.790
And this is where you would provide your condition.

00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:22.630
Maybe,

00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:25.850
let's say age should be greater than 18.

00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:29.850
You would see the same getting reflected over here as well.

00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:32.340
But off course,

00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:33.870
we don't have the column age.

00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:35.840
You can indigenes that if you wish,

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:40.400
but just trying to show you how we can create the check constraint.

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:45.980
And there's another constraint,

00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:46.860
basically,

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:50.850
which is the exclude constraint.

00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:51.300
Now,

00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:52.410
this is not a standard.

00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:54.630
Ask your constraint,

00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:57.800
so would better not talk about it at the moment.

00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:02.050
So that's it.

00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:04.000
See you on the next radio.
