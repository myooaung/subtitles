00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.340
in this video,

00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:06.240
I'll try to uncover some of the other competence president as part off PG admin and try to

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.730
understand their purpose.

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:11.550
Why their existing the value that they're going to add etcetera.

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:12.700
Honestly,

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.750
this is something that I didn't plan to cover,

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:20.650
but we all dairy when beyond what is planned when we talked about all these objects.

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:22.550
So I thought,

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:29.210
Why not talk about the remaining components President BG admin so that our course will be a

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.350
complete course.

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:32.070
So let's try to understand.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:32.550
First,

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.650
let's talk about this dashboard in here,

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:39.060
all the status sticks that looked like a stock market.

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.580
Graphs,

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:40.380
etcetera.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.780
They're just showing all the rial time information,

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.900
and these graphs would actually make sense when you have a huge amount off transactions

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.400
happening in your application.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.490
At the moment,

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:56.260
we don't have an application that is using this database,

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.180
and so the one many transactions.

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.350
So you're not seeing any kind of a fluctuation in these graphs,

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:07.650
but in real world you'd be able to keep track on number off silver sessions.

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.840
That application has initiated a number of transactions that took place over a period off a

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:22.550
second etcetera number off table rows that are being inserted and number off rose are being

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:24.570
read or two pills that are being read.

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.500
Also,

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.850
it's sort of information,

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.250
and below is the table that shows all the past sessions.

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:37.310
You can sort of take a look at it and get a sense off who has done what the locks is,

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.880
something that we had talked about acquiring a lock for a relation etcetera can keep track

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.450
off them as well Again.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:45.370
This would make sense,

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:49.790
especially when you have a huge amount of transactions that are taking place in your

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:50.550
application.

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.740
And still the sections ready much.

00:01:53.740 --> 00:02:01.550
Are there for the very purpose to get it sort of like a past history or the summary to get

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.450
your sense of what's going on in your application.

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:10.040
The properties part is similar to what you would configure when you're trying to create a

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.790
database.

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:12.250
For example,

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.420
if I choose and depending on the type of object that you select,

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.470
the properties panel will change for choose the database,

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.680
it's going to show its properties.

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:23.400
So,

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.780
basically,

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.470
whatever you're going to see here,

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:26.890
for example,

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.230
the table space,

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.170
etcetera,

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.210
same thing is going to get reflected here,

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:37.070
and you can actually do the same stuff that you would do in the properties panel when you

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.950
right click on an object.

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.510
So that's about it.

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:50.770
The Eskil parties shows a SQL that has actually helped in creation off this database again

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.770
,

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.050
this is specific to the object that you select.

00:02:53.050 --> 00:03:01.060
The statistics section will show a summary off all the information.

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.990
For example,

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:05.320
you'd be able to see number off people's inserted so far,

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.060
the number off triples off,

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.610
fetched,

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:08.850
updated or deleted,

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:14.160
and all that sort of information dependencies.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.630
You may not be able to see any dependence is when you choose database.

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.650
But when you choose a schema,

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.860
prince stands the public skimming.

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:29.740
Then you would be seeing something getting populated and same thing goes for tables as

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:30.060
ville.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.520
It's I would like to select the students stable.

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:39.940
You would notice that this is sort of like a summary where this table is dependent on well

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.940
,

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.220
don't think of dependency as the dictionary,

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:44.510
meaning off dependency.

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:45.670
In this context,

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:46.970
it's going to very different.

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:53.200
This just means that this is their off objects that are kind off using this particular

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:53.950
table,

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:55.270
for example,

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:56.590
If you're talking about function,

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.870
then we did use the students table in it.

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.050
So basically all such kind of information you would find here.

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:10.010
So that's about this section or this particular panel in this PG admin.

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:12.250
Let's talk about the menu items here.

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:17.480
The file menu item is similar to a file menu item in any other application.

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:18.240
For example,

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:19.380
if you just click that,

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.770
you get to configure some preferences,

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:26.960
and this is somewhat synonymous to preferences in Eclipse,

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:33.190
say that you would like to change some display settings or change the user language to

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.050
something else like French,

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:37.850
Russian or whatever.

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:40.970
So all that sort off things you confined here.

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:45.200
Maybe you'd like to increase the fund or change the color,

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:46.150
etcetera.

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:52.960
You can also result the layout in case if you have missed with it.

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.210
And next comes the objects,

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:03.120
and depending on the object that just select the many would change captains of selected a

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.880
table.

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.630
You're seeing this menu but finesse.

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:07.260
Select,

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.630
say,

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:10.410
a schema or a database.

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:12.550
You're going to see a different menu item.

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:13.320
Basically,

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:14.290
whatever you see,

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:17.120
when you right click on a particular object,

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.650
you would pretty much be the same.

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:25.710
So this is kind of like an alternative way off dealing with objects and its properties.

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:27.700
Nothing really fancy.

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:30.170
The tools are set off tools,

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:34.490
which would actually that you perform a verity off things,

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:37.350
and all these tools again would make sense.

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:40.760
When you have an application running behind the scenes,

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.220
manipulating all the data in your database,

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:45.200
then you might want to make use off.

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:46.150
Some of these,

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:48.430
especially backup,

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:51.020
is something that is pretty important.

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:51.820
For example,

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:56.360
we can actually take a back up off a particular database or ah,

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:00.570
table and then in Justin gives if something goes wrong with the database weaken,

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:05.790
sort off restore the database back to its original state.

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:06.960
For example,

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.310
I can just take a quick backup if you wish.

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:11.550
Let's call it is dear,

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:12.600
for instance,

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.850
and click backup.

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:16.910
By the way,

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:22.550
go ahead and try to explore other options present as part of the back of panel.

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:24.360
For example,

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:25.850
if you take a look at this,

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:27.650
you can quick cava quick.

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:30.610
Look at all these different options we have.

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:32.190
In my experience.

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:35.740
I just used to take a backup Occasionally.

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:37.050
Basically,

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:38.800
this task would be taken care by data.

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.940
Best administrators out my job as a developer,

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:42.850
to be honest with you,

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:44.820
So let me cancel.

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:47.350
So here is Ah,

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:51.070
our completed activity off backup.

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:53.540
You can click this click here for details,

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:57.360
and then you would be able to see the location off the file.

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:58.180
It's in users.

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:02.050
Admin document is DF,

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:11.890
so let's close this or let's navigate to that directory It's in.

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:17.650
Users have mean documents,

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:20.740
and here is the back of fire.

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:28.000
You can also choose the kind of file that you'd like to create that you find in that back a

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.380
panel or wizard or whatever you call it.

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:32.680
So that's about it.

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:34.720
And let's try to do something.

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:39.270
Let's take a little risk and try to delete one off these tables.

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:47.850
And let's if we'd be able to restore what we have deleted accidentally.

00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:52.250
Someone to choose that file I went to provide.

00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:59.390
I want to choose this file and select restore.

00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:02.620
This might take a while.

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:07.950
I doubt if this is going to work because I believe we have to choose the database in which

00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:09.660
I would like to run.

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:10.600
Oh,

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:11.560
it's successful.

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:16.690
Let's refresh and looks like things.

00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:18.330
Okay,

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:18.580
well,

00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:20.750
it didn't restore really looks like.

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:24.710
So let's use the database and click on Restore.

00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:30.150
And then again choose the file and click on this store.

00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:36.920
Let's see if this is going to work and it failed.

00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:38.630
Let's take a look at the error.

00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:46.700
You can see all the sequence off activities that took place to perform the restore

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:47.490
operation,

00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:52.560
and he would notice that somewhere down,

00:08:52.560 --> 00:09:00.250
the landlords find this error saying that function add joining that already exists with

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:01.550
same argument type.

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:02.630
Okay,

00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:05.030
this means that we're trying to restore a function,

00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:06.260
which is all that existing.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:11.960
Let's see if we can do something with the restore options we have.

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:14.670
I like to do restore again,

00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:19.610
which is the same file and then in destroyer options.

00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:26.110
Let's see if we have an option to sort off all right,

00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:27.250
existing data.

00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:30.810
So we have this option clean before it's store.

00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:36.240
I believe this would just wipe out everything from database and tried to recreate

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:37.450
everything from scratch.

00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:44.250
So strived that and click restore.

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:47.840
And,

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:48.450
uh,

00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:53.590
we do have another problem.

00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:55.370
Okay,

00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:59.900
Looks like this is just simply complaining that the table that we had dilated is not

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:03.000
existing already and so it had to replace it.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.950
Something of that sort.

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:14.780
Let's try to refresh and see if things will take effect and expanded tables.

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:15.500
And sure enough,

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:19.380
we have that new table populated along with its data.

00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:26.650
Usually back up and destroy.

00:10:26.650 --> 00:10:28.170
Operation is predator boast?

00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:29.740
I don't know why it is,

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:30.200
Ah,

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:35.060
throwing so many errors and it looks intimidating for beginners.

00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:40.090
But trust meters post grazes pretty robust application.

00:10:40.090 --> 00:10:41.960
So,

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:46.030
like so you got other tools with which you can do a lot of things.

00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:49.070
You can initiate the maintenance activity again.

00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:53.760
This would make sense when you have a huge amount of transactions taking place with huge

00:10:53.760 --> 00:11:00.720
amount of data like maybe you'd like to share index everything for efficiency is sick and

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:04.050
also sort of things coming to help.

00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:07.850
There are actually multiple locations where you can explore.

00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:09.290
For example,

00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:12.550
if you have any country in with any of the key words used in,

00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:19.190
Was Greece killed and you could just simply go to this website and there you would find a

00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:20.250
search field.

00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:25.660
You can just go ahead and put your keyword,

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:26.400
for example,

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:27.050
select.

00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:36.230
Then you can choose its documentation and see a lot of things that you can do with the

00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:37.290
select query.

00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:39.600
Similarly,

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:43.830
something can be seen from the Post Grace Shell.

00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:50.550
Let's open it up and it's log in.

00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:53.250
Type in help.

00:11:53.250 --> 00:11:55.850
You'd get various options here,

00:11:55.850 --> 00:11:57.950
so if you type in slash hedge,

00:11:57.950 --> 00:12:01.380
you would get help for SQL commands.

00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:02.650
So let's do that.

00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:08.290
So this is a list off a skill key was that you can use to use your database.

00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:09.930
Similarly,

00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:15.320
can type in slash question mark to get you help for various commands.

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:17.700
Japan Drum in the spear scale shell,

00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:18.760
for example,

00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:20.720
slash Q Till quit.

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:21.750
Let's do that.

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:26.400
Terminated the job?

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:27.450
Yes.

00:12:27.450 --> 00:12:29.250
Also one of these years.

00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:33.610
Where to get help is by clicking one of these objects.

00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:37.310
Prince stands a table.

00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:39.770
You can use this to icons.

00:12:39.770 --> 00:12:43.280
You can pretty much see these two icons in every problem that you get in.

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:44.090
PG admin.

00:12:44.090 --> 00:12:50.880
The I icon will take your the SQL Help their skill command that you can run to sort of work

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:51.890
with that object.

00:12:51.890 --> 00:12:52.730
Hurrican.

00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:59.730
See what all can go inside this panel or disprove romped by clicking this question Mark I

00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:03.070
can and Justin,

00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:07.150
because if any off these help options doesn't help you adjust your problem.

00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:09.050
Then you can certainly make use off.

00:13:09.050 --> 00:13:11.080
Google are.

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:16.750
Stack off with another website where you're pretty likely to find a solution for your

00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:17.480
problem.

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:19.570
May be the problem that you're facing now.

00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:23.450
Might have already been asked by somebody in stack overflow.

00:13:23.450 --> 00:13:25.260
So it's a pretty good website,

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:29.170
and often if you search your query in Google,

00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:31.110
it would take you to stack overflow,

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:35.750
lastly or like to mention that SQL is pretty last.

00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:38.950
It has almost a dictionary off key words,

00:13:38.950 --> 00:13:43.480
so it's hard to fit everything under single course.

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:45.100
But that being said,

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:52.020
what a make sure is that we have covered all the frequently used keywords and escrow

00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:52.850
statements.

00:13:52.850 --> 00:13:57.090
It is somewhat similar to learning a new language.

00:13:57.090 --> 00:13:59.010
Say that you're trying to learn English,

00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:02.590
then you don't tend to learn each and every word in the dictionary.

00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:05.790
You're just simply learn all the common words,

00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:08.580
which are frequently used for your day to day activities.

00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:09.230
Similarly,

00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:14.960
we have code the Eskil keywords that would help you as a Java developer,

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:15.960
but just in case,

00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:21.650
if you're very curious about some of the other keywords that we might have missed.

00:14:21.650 --> 00:14:31.190
Then you can go toe this website w three schools search for a secure and you would be

00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:33.050
landed in this page.

00:14:33.050 --> 00:14:36.180
This website is not tuned.

00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:37.540
Proposal be Eskil,

00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:41.420
meaning that some of these queries are not meant for post rescue.

00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:46.420
If you're straight of a copy this query and use it in your post grease,

00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:48.250
then it may or may not work.

00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:53.450
But the interesting thing that this website offices you can experiment with structured

00:14:53.450 --> 00:14:55.350
query language In general,

00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:56.800
you can click this button,

00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:57.460
drive it,

00:14:57.460 --> 00:14:59.620
try try to yourself,

00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:02.260
and you can experiment with their database.

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:08.240
They have a sample database with some sample content so that you can experiment with it

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:09.850
with your SQL queries.

00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:12.240
You can just type it down here,

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:13.000
run SQL,

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.550
and you would see the result.

00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:19.850
You can experiment with pretty much all the keywords president in SQL.

00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:23.980
I believe they might have covered all of them and in fact,

00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:25.400
we might have already discussed,

00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:25.620
say,

00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:27.400
80% off these already.

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:29.390
But Justin guests,

00:15:29.390 --> 00:15:34.750
if you're if you're curious about the rest 20% you can experiment them over here.

00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:38.410
So don't take this website for learning purposes.

00:15:38.410 --> 00:15:38.850
In fact,

00:15:38.850 --> 00:15:41.800
I find the information is too simple.

00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:47.150
Firing often doesn't describe exactly what each one of these commands does,

00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:47.820
but,

00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:48.840
as I mentioned,

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:53.850
use this website as a tool to experiment with structured query language,

00:15:53.850 --> 00:15:55.760
but not to learn.

00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:59.110
SQL our post grease in general.

00:15:59.110 --> 00:16:02.070
All right.

00:16:02.070 --> 00:16:03.550
I think that will suffice.

00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:05.630
See you soon.
