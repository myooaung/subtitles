00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.740
All right,

00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:04.950
let us try to implore code by reading the data from the database.

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.810
So we're going to pretty much have the same court.

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:14.650
Except instead of hard coding all the data off the student details like this,

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:17.500
we're going to first the details from the database,

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:23.600
and we're going to use a vile loop to look to each and every student and then display each

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:29.040
student details in some presentable manner by wrapping the data with these HTML tags.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.550
So let's see how it's done.

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.420
So the way we go about it,

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:33.300
basically,

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.770
we're going to organizer Cordon.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:37.750
In this manner,

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.450
we'll introduce a piece off code that will connect to the database.

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.200
Isn't the jerry besiege our that we had included in our live directory?

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.210
And then we'll fetch the store indeed,

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:51.610
us from the database,

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.750
and then we'll present them to the user in some meaningful way.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.450
So for this purpose have created another Servet,

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.550
which does not have any code in it.

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:02.450
Now.

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:07.140
I could have Britain the court beforehand and could have explained it to you,

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.290
but I don't want to do this this time,

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.820
because the set off instructions that in malls to connect.

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.690
A data base is error prone,

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.160
so I won't go type along with you,

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.690
So let's see how it's done.

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:32.300
So full section is too connect to database and fit student students detail.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:38.120
The first thing that point to take care off is to include,

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:44.970
or rather load the driver class onto the jbm the driver class recite in the jar file that

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.800
we have included as part off the lib directory.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:58.030
So the way we load the class file onto JBM System is by saying class 0.4 name.

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.270
It's going to accept arguments that's going to the name of the class file,

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:02.650
including its package.

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:04.000
In our case,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.460
it's going to be ork dot post.

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.030
Greece was great.

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:20.540
Ask your dot driver Do take a note that the letter casing is very important here.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.620
The letter D has to be a per case,

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.450
and since we're using pose grease as a database software,

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:35.120
this has to be posed serious cure and this is actually going to throw class,

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.580
not phone exception would need to handle gracefully.

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.710
So I'm going to wrap this section off.

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:41.300
Corbett,

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:42.580
Try catch block.

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:43.650
Let's get it out.

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:50.530
The auto generated comments What comes next is we're going to try to connect to the

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.710
database by using a class called driver manager.

00:02:54.710 --> 00:03:04.660
So we'll have a driver manager Don't get connection and it except three different arguments

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.660
.

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:11.660
The 1st 1 is the Ural that helps you locate the database in our kids,

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.870
the database that were created.

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:14.280
In fact,

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.560
it's the default database his post Greece,

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:18.950
if you remember.

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:20.080
But before that,

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:25.730
we also need to tell the server location where dispose grease databases reciting.

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.250
So the way we specify it is by saying,

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.970
Jerry,

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:37.290
BC colon pause Greece cure again Colon.

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.750
And then you would specify the I P address off this silver.

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:41.950
In our case,

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:42.960
it's local host,

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:49.450
so I'm going to say 1 27.0 dot one,

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.150
along with the port number,

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.550
which will be 5432 In our case,

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:58.910
that's the port number,

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.600
which we had said while installing the software.

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:02.550
If you remember,

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:07.050
and the next two arguments is simply the using them and pass forward.

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:16.690
So it's going to be pause Greece and pause Greece.

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.350
That's it.

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:24.950
Now this instruction is actually going to return the connection object.

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:27.950
Now we have another here let's see what it is.

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:32.590
It says even this instruction is going to throw an exception,

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:34.710
which is a skill exception.

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:41.150
So let us handle it by adding a catch close to the existing try catch block.

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.480
All right.

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:44.640
Also,

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:50.500
if you notice the get connection method is actually returning an object called connection

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:57.950
that implements the connection interface so we can define our connection interface here.

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:03.590
And then let's make it now,

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:04.100
Here,

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.610
I'm going to do control shift.

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:07.070
Oh,

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:11.210
to import the required classes or interfaces.

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:16.260
Make sure what are the class feels that your classes or interfaces that you're importing

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.740
are part off this package java dot at school.

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.650
Don't import anything else.

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:27.590
So I'm going to say connection equals.

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:29.650
So until now,

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.500
using this connection object,

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:36.360
we can create a statement and execute and SQL query.

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:45.700
The query that we wanted to execute is going to be this and will use it in our code.

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:51.450
So I'm going to say connection,

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:55.450
don't create statement.

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:58.500
This will return the statement,

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.800
object So again for that,

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:07.570
I don't introduce a new reference type statement s equals.

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:10.440
No Alcantara shift.

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:10.940
Oh,

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:13.250
to import that interface.

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:17.950
And we've been death sane this to this.

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:25.130
We're pretty much reached the end off the formalities required to connect a data base.

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:32.000
Now we can actually Exubera quickly by saying statement dot exit get creating,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.480
and it's gonna tax it on string.

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:35.480
In our case,

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:37.880
it's going to be this.

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:40.590
This statement will execute this query,

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:48.100
but we wanted to get that result back here so that we can display them so this method would

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:50.560
return so called the result set.

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:53.850
So let's declare it over here.

00:06:53.850 --> 00:07:00.770
That's important as well.

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:07.490
And I'm going to say Horace equals eggs.

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:08.800
Get quickie Now.

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:12.570
This RS object will no have all the student details.

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:15.800
We just have to display them to save your time.

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:21.220
I already have a piece off code that's going to help us display the student details.

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:23.450
Let me just best it down here.

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:24.880
Here it is.

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:27.500
It's pretty simple and straightforward.

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:34.110
This instruction will actually display the heading tag with some hard coded text,

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:37.150
but the important section is this.

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:43.650
We're looping through that result said and trying toe fetch each and every individual

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:50.040
student details by saying results that dot get string is the method that is part of the

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:50.400
results.

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:58.150
That and you would specify the name off the column we had set in a student table.

00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:01.650
So it's going to be this.

00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:04.550
We specified the exact same name.

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:10.760
Still the name to be able to fetch the current students name Same goes with age and

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:11.970
description as well.

00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:13.830
So likewise,

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:17.840
were able to display all the student details also has a good practice.

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:23.030
We can also include the finally block to close all the open resources.

00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:25.940
Everything in here is a resource went to take her off,

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:27.250
closing them as well.

00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:29.360
So in order to save your time,

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:32.350
let me have the court ready and then I'll get back.

00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:40.000
So here we have it on disclosing all the resources and then again,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.350
we to have pride catch block for them as well.

00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:45.400
Or alternatively,

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:49.590
if your affair off the John Lines feature private resource,

00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:51.850
we could make yourself that as well.

00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:56.580
Let me just quickly show you how we can accomplish the same.

00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:58.550
It's pretty simple.

00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:04.550
Hardly going to do is to take this out,

00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:09.890
but all the resources inside the try section,

00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:11.990
you know,

00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:18.450
just like so we're going to have ah statement as well as part of the try.

00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:19.720
Well,

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:21.050
this is going to look messy.

00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:24.170
You just have to bear with me for a minute.

00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:32.110
And I sure are called the look cleaner and get it off these two,

00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:39.050
and then we can have we no longer need the finally block now,

00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:47.300
and we need try catch block for this,

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:47.680
though.

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:56.810
We can't have tried with resource for this instruction and similarly can now get it off.

00:09:56.810 --> 00:10:05.430
This these two instructions from here went to have private resource for the results.

00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:06.660
That as well.

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:10.650
So we're going to move it to here.

00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:17.050
So that's how it goes.

00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:19.550
Get it off this from here.

00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:21.650
All right.

00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:25.690
Will wrap everything inside this Kali braces,

00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:29.160
and we'll do some formatting.

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:31.680
This works.

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:33.850
We don't We don't need this because,

00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:34.620
you know,

00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:35.380
try catch block.

00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:36.900
We don't have this instruction.

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:39.250
No possibility for class,

00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:40.250
not phone exception.

00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:42.750
So but our code looks little cleaner.

00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:46.810
So if you're if you're comfortable with private resource,

00:10:46.810 --> 00:10:49.040
you can use it as you wish.

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:53.620
But since industry hasn't adopted all the javelin features yet,

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:57.910
I would assume that even you are not too pretty well used to it.

00:10:57.910 --> 00:11:02.850
So let me just undo all this changers and go back with Try,

00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:03.750
catch block.

00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:09.100
Here we are.

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:09.950
We're back.

00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:13.510
So now everything is set.

00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:17.050
Why don't we describe the courage to launch our application?

00:11:17.050 --> 00:11:20.870
Let's do that when direct,

00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:24.950
Click on this and run as run on so over.

00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:30.220
All right,

00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:31.150
we got another.

00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:32.770
Let's see what it means.

00:11:32.770 --> 00:11:34.650
It says it's no wonder exception.

00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:36.650
And then if you go to the council,

00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:40.090
you can actually traced through what's happening.

00:11:40.090 --> 00:11:44.850
It's a no suitable driver found for in the spot.

00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:49.270
How could God this I p incorrect as well as,

00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:49.560
Ah,

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:53.360
you know this one supposed to be jdb seen O J S D B.

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:57.610
Let's go get them and see if things will work.

00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:01.350
I'm sure it will work this time.

00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:11.750
I don't think we messed up with anything else or let let's hear the file clean the project

00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:13.510
how,

00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:16.200
as usual on drawn it again,

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:27.970
and this time it worked pretty well.

00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:34.620
Harris also note that I haven't included this,

00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:35.060
too.

00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:36.580
You are girls.

00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:37.270
If you wish,

00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:38.100
you can add them.

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:41.260
Also,

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:45.660
I need to mention that after we talk about structured query language,

00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:50.150
I've dedicated one or two videos talking about Jerry BC.

00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:52.950
So if you're not sure of what's happening in here,

00:12:52.950 --> 00:12:55.930
then you will better understand the concept then.

00:12:55.930 --> 00:12:58.490
So wait until that point.

00:12:58.490 --> 00:13:02.420
Moreover,

00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:06.370
we have written or code without following the industry's best practices.

00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:07.830
For example,

00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:11.150
it's not register that you include the estimate code as part of a soul.

00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:15.310
It we would want to let it go inside a jsp file.

00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:16.040
Similarly,

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:21.160
we don't want all these instructions that help us connect to the database to be part off A

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:21.160
.

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:25.650
So let we would warn them to be part off another class.

00:13:25.650 --> 00:13:32.510
We're actually going to make changes to our code and improve our code to make it fit for

00:13:32.510 --> 00:13:34.160
industry's best practices.

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:35.630
Basically,

00:13:35.630 --> 00:13:38.530
we're going to follow a tree tire architecture,

00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:39.080
moral,

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:39.730
real controller,

00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:40.470
architectural,

00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:41.870
which will talk about that later.

00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:42.730
Point of time.

00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:43.700
In fact,

00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:49.300
we were going to actually create a mini project with some basic operations,

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:55.670
were going to create a very basic school management application where that men can actually

00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:56.920
add a student,

00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:59.750
remove a student or update a student,

00:13:59.750 --> 00:14:01.550
or delete a student etcetera,

00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:04.250
all such kind of basic operations.

00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:06.950
So stay tuned.

00:14:06.950 --> 00:14:09.150
There's a lot coming our way.

00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:11.490
Hope that makes sense.

00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:13.050
See you in my next video
