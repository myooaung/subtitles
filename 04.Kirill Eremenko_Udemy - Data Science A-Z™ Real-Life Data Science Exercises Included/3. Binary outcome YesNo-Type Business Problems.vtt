00:00:01.170  -->  00:00:02.450
Hello and welcome back.

2

00:00:02.520  -->  00:00:06.870
And today we're going to investigate our daughter said that we're going to be using for this section

3

00:00:06.870  -->  00:00:09.830
of the course so let's go ahead and open up Grettel.

4

00:00:10.140  -->  00:00:11.750
Go to File Open daughter.

5

00:00:11.930  -->  00:00:12.680
Use a file.

6

00:00:12.680  -->  00:00:16.170
Mine's on my desktop like always moiling section as you can see.

7

00:00:16.170  -->  00:00:22.860
We're slowly getting through the section or through this part of the course so logistic regression we

8

00:00:22.860  -->  00:00:23.670
file.

9

00:00:23.670  -->  00:00:29.240
There is e-mail offer that's fine that's fine.

10

00:00:29.340  -->  00:00:33.450
And then in this window here you can see that griddle picked up that we have a categorical variable

11

00:00:33.450  -->  00:00:39.000
which is gender it's got two categories and one is going to be female 2 is going to be male but we know

12

00:00:39.000  -->  00:00:41.310
how to correct that or how to deal with that.

13

00:00:41.310  -->  00:00:43.830
So we'll get to that later.

14

00:00:43.830  -->  00:00:49.620
Now what we want to do is select all of our variables and go to data display value.

15

00:00:49.620  -->  00:00:52.200
So we just have a brief look at the values.

16

00:00:52.320  -->  00:00:53.630
So what can we see here.

17

00:00:53.640  -->  00:00:56.840
First of all we've got the age variable right.

18

00:00:57.060  -->  00:00:59.380
That's good.

19

00:00:59.390  -->  00:01:01.750
Then we've got the gender variable.

20

00:01:01.770  -->  00:01:04.800
So those are our independent variables.

21

00:01:04.800  -->  00:01:06.420
And then you've got the dependent variable.

22

00:01:06.420  -->  00:01:07.220
Took action.

23

00:01:07.230  -->  00:01:13.830
So whether or not the person open up the email clicked the link took up the offer bought the product

24

00:01:13.830  -->  00:01:14.220
.

25

00:01:14.220  -->  00:01:22.170
So whatever our action was in in our specific case when we were sending out this email offer and we

26

00:01:22.170  -->  00:01:24.300
also see that we have 100 records.

27

00:01:24.300  -->  00:01:30.270
The interesting thing we see right away is that our independent or dependent variable took action is

28

00:01:30.450  -->  00:01:30.930
binary.

29

00:01:30.930  -->  00:01:33.360
So it's either 0 1 yes or no it makes sense.

30

00:01:33.390  -->  00:01:34.480
That's what we're measuring.

31

00:01:34.490  -->  00:01:40.380
What did they take action or not how much money they spent not how much time it took them to take action

32

00:01:40.380  -->  00:01:43.620
or we think that we're just measuring did they take action or not.

33

00:01:43.620  -->  00:01:46.460
Very simple straightforward yes or no.

34

00:01:46.500  -->  00:01:52.980
So I'm going to bring up the types of variables slide that we had in them refresh our section of the

35

00:01:52.980  -->  00:01:53.520
course.

36

00:01:53.760  -->  00:01:54.780
And here I wanted to show you.

37

00:01:54.780  -->  00:01:58.510
So we are kind of venturing into new territory.

38

00:01:58.530  -->  00:02:03.150
So we've said that we have variables and we had we have categorical numeric variables and let's just

39

00:02:03.150  -->  00:02:04.000
focus on those two.

40

00:02:04.010  -->  00:02:13.710
Now we've already experienced scenarios when our independent variables are numeric like age or years

41

00:02:13.710  -->  00:02:21.090
of experience or how much money a company is spending on R&D or marketing or administration.

42

00:02:21.090  -->  00:02:22.710
So we've seen those scenarios.

43

00:02:22.770  -->  00:02:31.470
We've also seen scenarios when our independent variables are categorical for instance gender or if the

44

00:02:31.470  -->  00:02:37.110
company is located in New York or San Francisco so when we had to create dummy variables and include

45

00:02:37.110  -->  00:02:38.040
those in our model.

46

00:02:38.100  -->  00:02:44.520
So we have four independent variables we've done both this and this for dependent variables though we've

47

00:02:44.520  -->  00:02:48.840
only done so far in numeric variables so both in the simple linear regression and the multiple linear

48

00:02:48.840  -->  00:02:54.960
regression we always had numeric dependent variable so that y value the the variable that we were predicting

49

00:02:54.960  -->  00:03:00.560
it has always been numeric it has been how much profit the company is going to make.

50

00:03:00.660  -->  00:03:03.720
How much what the salary is of the person.

51

00:03:03.720  -->  00:03:08.100
So it's always been a number or it's never been a category.

52

00:03:08.250  -->  00:03:14.940
Well when I say that we're venturing into new territory now is because now our dependent variable is

53

00:03:14.940  -->  00:03:16.290
actually categorical.

54

00:03:16.290  -->  00:03:23.280
So this whole yes no situation that's a category you're categorizing your respondents or you're the

55

00:03:23.280  -->  00:03:29.490
people that took or were part of this experiment or falling into two categories those who did take the

56

00:03:29.490  -->  00:03:30.730
offer and those who didn't.

57

00:03:30.900  -->  00:03:36.240
And that is why things are going to be different and we'll see exactly how right now.

58

00:03:36.240  -->  00:03:41.400
So I'm going to close this and we're going to close this as well.

59

00:03:41.460  -->  00:03:47.520
So let's go ahead and construct a chart a chart that we've seen many times.

60

00:03:47.520  -->  00:03:57.030
We often see charts where our dependent variable is on the y axis vertical and our one of our independent

61

00:03:57.030  -->  00:03:59.760
variables is on the horizontal axis.

62

00:03:59.760  -->  00:04:00.880
The X-axis.

63

00:04:00.900  -->  00:04:07.950
So let's go ahead and construct the child will do that for took action of course that's our dependent

64

00:04:07.950  -->  00:04:13.350
verbal will put on the y axis and we will on the horizontal axis will look at age.

65

00:04:13.560  -->  00:04:16.210
Let's go ahead and do that.

66

00:04:16.350  -->  00:04:23.650
You need to go to View Graaff specified variables x y scatter.

67

00:04:24.090  -->  00:04:30.510
And here we want to put h on to the x axis x axis is the top here.

68

00:04:30.510  -->  00:04:35.920
Be careful and took action on the y axis and click OK.

69

00:04:36.180  -->  00:04:38.580
And what do we see here.

70

00:04:38.580  -->  00:04:40.190
First of all what are we used to seeing.

71

00:04:40.200  -->  00:04:46.830
We're used to seeing lots of scattered dots all over the place for instance like in the example of your

72

00:04:46.890  -->  00:04:54.930
or of people's experience and their salary or of how much you're spending on marketing and what your

73

00:04:54.930  -->  00:04:55.860
profit is.

74

00:04:55.860  -->  00:05:02.610
So we're used to seeing these scattered data points all over the place and then one line like this ad

75

00:05:02.610  -->  00:05:11.430
goes through them and approximates a simple regression or represents a simple linear regression that

76

00:05:11.700  -->  00:05:18.090
goes through here on now how do we see something completely different because our indep our dependent

77

00:05:18.090  -->  00:05:24.360
variable is categorical it is either on zero which means people didn't take up the offer or it's on

78

00:05:24.360  -->  00:05:24.750
one.

79

00:05:24.750  -->  00:05:26.860
Which means people did take up the offer.

80

00:05:27.180  -->  00:05:33.540
At the same time the funny thing is that Grettel tried to actually put a simple linear regression through

81

00:05:33.540  -->  00:05:37.150
this dataset and this is the best line it could fit.

82

00:05:37.380  -->  00:05:43.680
And although the simple integration that makes no sense here at all it's not the right tool to model

83

00:05:43.680  -->  00:05:47.160
this data or this phenomenon that we're observing.

84

00:05:47.250  -->  00:05:49.820
We do at the same time see that there.

85

00:05:49.920  -->  00:05:56.430
It looks like there is some sort of trend or sort of something going on in the dark it's totally random

86

00:05:56.430  -->  00:06:04.830
you can see that people in the younger age groups from 25 to 45 they're more skewed to the left or they're

87

00:06:04.830  -->  00:06:06.670
less likely to take up the offer.

88

00:06:06.960  -->  00:06:12.780
And people are between 35 and 50 are more likely to take up the offer so they're more skewed to the

89

00:06:12.780  -->  00:06:16.590
right and or shift more shifted to the right.

90

00:06:16.590  -->  00:06:19.430
These dots are shifts the right is not shifted to the left.

91

00:06:19.440  -->  00:06:21.050
So definitely something is going on.

92

00:06:21.060  -->  00:06:27.810
But at the same time we see that the linear regression modeling linear a simple linear regression is

93

00:06:27.810  -->  00:06:34.150
not the right tool to predict this data set and predict this phenomenon or explain this phenomenon.

94

00:06:34.350  -->  00:06:38.850
So that's what we're going to be doing in the section we're going to introduce a brand new tool called

95

00:06:38.850  -->  00:06:40.530
logistic regression.

96

00:06:40.650  -->  00:06:44.350
And we will see how it can help us solve these scenarios.

97

00:06:44.520  -->  00:06:45.710
And why do we need to do that.

98

00:06:45.720  -->  00:06:50.350
Well because you will come across these situations quite a lot.

99

00:06:50.370  -->  00:06:55.440
This is very it's a very common type of analysis when something you're trying to predict whether something

100

00:06:55.440  -->  00:06:57.320
is going to happen or not going to happen.

101

00:06:57.510  -->  00:07:04.800
The classic example is in medicine when you have say a drug and you want to test whether it's helping

102

00:07:05.010  -->  00:07:10.080
patients or not you can use an AB test for that definitely but sometimes AB tests are not sufficient

103

00:07:10.080  -->  00:07:17.130
because you have many independent variables so you can't just control for control for everything and

104

00:07:17.130  -->  00:07:18.880
just check one independent variable.

105

00:07:18.900  -->  00:07:24.900
Now sometimes you might have the age of the people that are testing the country they live in the mood

106

00:07:24.900  -->  00:07:30.620
they're in all sorts of different factors and it when you have a combination of factors then it'll just

107

00:07:30.740  -->  00:07:36.430
regression test that you'll also come across these types of problems.

108

00:07:36.450  -->  00:07:42.780
In a business environment a lot especially if you're dealing with customers or in a customer centric

109

00:07:42.780  -->  00:07:46.250
organization because you need to do a lot of classification.

110

00:07:46.260  -->  00:07:50.940
And we'll talk about this about classification versus regression in the next tutorial quote quite a

111

00:07:50.940  -->  00:07:51.410
bit.

112

00:07:51.600  -->  00:07:57.780
But what that means is that you need to categorize your customers or you need to create segments you

113

00:07:57.780  -->  00:08:04.410
need to understand how they respond to different offers how they not only offers how they how they behave

114

00:08:04.590  -->  00:08:11.730
based Giono do they browse by mobile Do they browse via Internet or do they do that when do they come

115

00:08:11.730  -->  00:08:14.520
into your store or what type of products they prefer.

116

00:08:14.520  -->  00:08:19.100
Lots and lots of different things and so every time you can think of a yes no question.

117

00:08:19.200  -->  00:08:24.600
And at the same time there's quite a few independent variables that can affect that.

118

00:08:24.600  -->  00:08:27.180
Yes no question then you need logistic regression.

119

00:08:27.390  -->  00:08:35.190
And if you pause for a second after this tutorial and think about it how in your work when situations

120

00:08:35.190  -->  00:08:40.320
like that arise when you have to deal with them or when your company they arise and you can possibly

121

00:08:40.320  -->  00:08:45.690
you know research them and understand them investigate them and improve how the company is performing

122

00:08:46.170  -->  00:08:49.910
just based on some modeling in that space.

123

00:08:49.920  -->  00:08:55.920
I'm sure you'll be able to come up with one or two at least one or two examples of how these situations

124

00:08:55.920  -->  00:09:00.260
occur in your business environment and that's it for today.

125

00:09:00.270  -->  00:09:05.460
Next I'm going to be an interesting tutorial we're going to talk about logistic regression intuition

126

00:09:05.780  -->  00:09:08.460
and Accorsi then until next I'm happy analyzing
