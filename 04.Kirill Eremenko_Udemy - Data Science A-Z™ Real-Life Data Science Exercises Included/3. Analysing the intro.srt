1

00:00:00,720  -->  00:00:02,250
This tutorial is going to have two parts.

2

00:00:02,250  -->  00:00:08,100
First we're going to watch the intro for my presentation as it was and then we're going to watch it

3

00:00:08,100  -->  00:00:08,540
again.

4

00:00:08,550  -->  00:00:10,220
Plots with cool outs.

5

00:00:10,230  -->  00:00:16,170
So I will actually highlight some things that I'd like to draw your attention to that are used in my

6

00:00:16,170  -->  00:00:16,770
presentation.

7

00:00:16,920  -->  00:00:19,580
So let's go ahead and get started with that.

8

00:00:20,220  -->  00:00:35,290
As you probably gathered on the server and this presentation is one of the successes in this case I

9

00:00:35,320  -->  00:00:50,690
don't want to just say you're going to use it to make your way home for the next.

10

00:00:50,750  -->  00:00:52,090
It's so

11

00:00:54,870  -->  00:00:57,600
so.

12

00:00:58,330  -->  00:01:04,480
So those are all what.

13

00:01:05,160  -->  00:01:16,420
All right just so everybody else is out.

14

00:01:16,990  -->  00:01:36,920
Plus it's just to remind them of their funds and so on your list goes on HBO where else was pay for

15

00:01:38,730  -->  00:01:45,780
members from fundraising.

16

00:01:47,350  -->  00:01:49,230
There was a presentation in row format.

17

00:01:49,230  -->  00:01:50,600
Now let's watch it again.

18

00:01:50,610  -->  00:01:59,900
But with some notation it's a super intelligent design.

19

00:02:00,930  -->  00:02:12,120
One of the success of this case to a jury.

20

00:02:12,250  -->  00:02:15,770
I want to show the stakes.

21

00:02:15,870  -->  00:02:24,030
My guess is to make your answer you come for the next day.

22

00:02:24,210  -->  00:02:27,710
So.

23

00:02:29,190  -->  00:02:38,350
So we're getting paid for what.

24

00:02:38,430  -->  00:02:46,840
All right just so to speak.

25

00:02:48,190  -->  00:02:48,470
This

26

00:02:51,250  -->  00:02:57,400
it's interesting to hear funds this fall.

27

00:02:58,020  -->  00:03:15,230
So what is your take on there is where else was today members from NBC

28

00:03:18,020  -->  00:03:20,360
was.

29

00:03:20,730  -->  00:03:22,360
All right so we're going to stop here.

30

00:03:22,470  -->  00:03:26,830
If you'd like to watch the full presentation it is available at the end of this section.

31

00:03:26,880  -->  00:03:31,830
Otherwise in the Nixa Tauriel we're going to go through these notes in a bit more detail and a look

32

00:03:31,830  -->  00:03:32,550
for you that
