1

00:00:01,290  -->  00:00:03,700
Go incipit them a real life example.

2

00:00:03,780  -->  00:00:06,050
This is going to be a very interesting one.

3

00:00:06,060  -->  00:00:11,130
Now a lot of people think that a data scientist is like a magician who can get everything out of the

4

00:00:11,140  -->  00:00:12,990
data everything of the numbers.

5

00:00:12,990  -->  00:00:14,600
That is not entirely true.

6

00:00:14,610  -->  00:00:16,310
A lot of things can be derived.

7

00:00:16,320  -->  00:00:20,250
A lot of insights can be derived from the data and numbers but some things cannot.

8

00:00:20,250  -->  00:00:25,710
Some things are just not in the data and there's no way you can get them out of there.

9

00:00:25,920  -->  00:00:32,490
And that is why it is extremely important for you Roger project to communicate with people on the job

10

00:00:32,520  -->  00:00:32,600
.

11

00:00:32,730  -->  00:00:38,610
So I'll give you a a pretty example of the main example I want to share with you but I'll give you a

12

00:00:38,610  -->  00:00:39,460
smaller example.

13

00:00:39,480  -->  00:00:46,500
So if you're doing some research for how efficient a call center is working I did do on those projects

14

00:00:46,830  -->  00:00:47,450
you go.

15

00:00:47,490  -->  00:00:53,270
And after you've done all the work you've done some research you've gathered some initial data.

16

00:00:53,310  -->  00:00:56,740
You go and you sit with the people in the call center.

17

00:00:56,760  -->  00:01:02,850
In fact actually said with them for half a day and I listened to them talk to customers and it's all

18

00:01:02,850  -->  00:01:06,930
legal by the way because you know they tell the customer that this has been recorded or Montral and

19

00:01:06,930  -->  00:01:07,260
so on.

20

00:01:07,350  -->  00:01:12,030
But I listen to them and I want it to be like them for one day.

21

00:01:12,060  -->  00:01:14,820
I wanted to get insights into the work they do.

22

00:01:14,820  -->  00:01:20,520
I wanted to feel the pain points that they feel the experience is that they go through I want to go

23

00:01:20,520  -->  00:01:25,220
through them as well because that is the art of art science.

24

00:01:25,290  -->  00:01:27,160
Like anybody can crunch numbers right.

25

00:01:27,300  -->  00:01:33,540
But the creative creative part the ideas ideas come from you know we're going to have ideas unless you

26

00:01:33,540  -->  00:01:40,890
open up to the world unless you engage in this same activity that you are trying to optimize or add

27

00:01:40,890  -->  00:01:49,320
efficiency to or you know analyze the more exposure you have where you get to this activity or to the

28

00:01:49,320  -->  00:01:49,820
people there.

29

00:01:49,840  -->  00:01:54,990
For this to be the better for you know for the really cool example that I wanted to share with you.

30

00:01:55,170  -->  00:02:02,820
So I was doing some analytics around how customers respond to a request to consolidate their funds so

31

00:02:02,820  -->  00:02:11,490
basically a customer has lots of accounts in different organizations say this was for a pension fund

32

00:02:11,490  -->  00:02:18,540
so a customer has lots of different pension accounts in different funds which are comparison each other

33

00:02:18,540  -->  00:02:19,180
of course.

34

00:02:19,320  -->  00:02:26,970
And then at some point during the year they get a letter in the Post say hey you have lots of accounts

35

00:02:27,000  -->  00:02:29,690
why don't you consolidate them and put them all into one.

36

00:02:29,880  -->  00:02:38,220
And so I put it together a chart which speaks to how likely people are to consolidate depending on the

37

00:02:38,220  -->  00:02:39,570
number of accounts that they have.

38

00:02:39,570  -->  00:02:46,890
So people would have anywhere from 2 to 13 15 even up to 17 different accounts and different pension

39

00:02:46,890  -->  00:02:51,060
funds and of course they're paying additional fees and it's in their best interest to consolidate.

40

00:02:51,240  -->  00:02:58,770
And so if we look at this chart you can see that the more accounts people have the less likely they

41

00:02:58,770  -->  00:03:01,100
are to consolidate up to a certain point.

42

00:03:01,290  -->  00:03:02,490
And this is like a mock up charge.

43

00:03:02,490  -->  00:03:06,960
So it's not the real thing but this is what it approximately what looked like this is to convey the

44

00:03:06,960  -->  00:03:07,600
message.

45

00:03:07,740  -->  00:03:08,190
So.

46

00:03:08,280  -->  00:03:12,780
And but then when you see that once you get to 13 accounts it spikes up.

47

00:03:12,780  -->  00:03:20,010
It's like people are very likely to consolidate their accounts at 13 accounts but at 12 and 10 and 11

48

00:03:20,280  -->  00:03:21,590
they're not as likely.

49

00:03:21,720  -->  00:03:22,470
So what was that.

50

00:03:22,470  -->  00:03:23,370
What does it go there.

51

00:03:23,400  -->  00:03:26,570
Like how how can you explain something like that.

52

00:03:26,590  -->  00:03:28,640
There's no logical explanation right.

53

00:03:28,650  -->  00:03:33,200
It looks like the more accounts you have the more work it has to do to consolidate them right.

54

00:03:33,390  -->  00:03:35,690
And the less likely you are to consolidate.

55

00:03:35,700  -->  00:03:41,850
And yet at exactly 13 it spikes up I could not explain it for the life of me I could not understand

56

00:03:41,850  -->  00:03:42,680
what is going on.

57

00:03:42,870  -->  00:03:44,870
So how did I find out the answer.

58

00:03:45,000  -->  00:03:51,020
Well I went and sat with the people who process these forms and the forms come back in the process them

59

00:03:51,030  -->  00:03:57,080
they you know manually enter them into the system and do the cancellation requests.

60

00:03:57,180  -->  00:04:02,040
And while I was sitting with these people I asked one of them like what do you think of this problem

61

00:04:02,060  -->  00:04:03,100
like why would this occur.

62

00:04:03,130  -->  00:04:05,050
And for him it was a no brainer.

63

00:04:05,190  -->  00:04:09,690
He actually gave me a paper so I've got I'm going to muck up for you which I do of myself.

64

00:04:09,870  -->  00:04:17,260
And he showed me one of these forums and what I found the forum was which is you can see here that there's

65

00:04:17,280  -->  00:04:23,370
three accounts here on each page is three accounts so three accounts and the first page three accounts

66

00:04:23,370  -->  00:04:25,660
and the second three accounts.

67

00:04:25,770  -->  00:04:26,040
Right.

68

00:04:26,040  -->  00:04:27,120
So that's six.

69

00:04:27,240  -->  00:04:28,550
That's nine.

70

00:04:28,560  -->  00:04:30,030
That's 12.

71

00:04:30,030  -->  00:04:32,420
So 12 is two pages.

72

00:04:32,520  -->  00:04:35,250
Once you get to 13 that's a third page.

73

00:04:35,250  -->  00:04:37,380
So it was a psychological thing.

74

00:04:37,380  -->  00:04:42,510
When people see two pages of accounts it's like it's for them it's it's they thinking oh this is you

75

00:04:42,510  -->  00:04:47,450
know too much work I got to I got to really spend time on this I can I can do this I'll do it.

76

00:04:47,550  -->  00:04:53,520
But when they see three pages they're like whoa that is too much fees that I'm paying that is way through

77

00:04:53,520  -->  00:04:53,990
the roof.

78

00:04:54,090  -->  00:05:01,290
So this jump from two pages to three pages the psychological phenomenon actually prompted people or

79

00:05:01,290  -->  00:05:06,700
forced people to go ahead and console that and that's why there was a spike at 13 accounts.

80

00:05:06,750  -->  00:05:13,020
So insights like that you can get from data you can only get from the people on the job and it is their

81

00:05:13,020  -->  00:05:19,020
business knowledge their internal experience in the business that you can and should leverage in your

82

00:05:19,050  -->  00:05:19,860
nonsense.
