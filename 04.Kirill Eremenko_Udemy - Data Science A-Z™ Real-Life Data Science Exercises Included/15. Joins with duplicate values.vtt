Hello and welcome back.

2

00:00:03.330  -->  00:00:08.310
And in today's tutorial we will be looking at duplicates and joins and by that we mean what happens

3

00:00:08.310  -->  00:00:14.070
when the column that we're joining on has duplicate values in one of the tables.

4

00:00:14.070  -->  00:00:20.670
In today's example we'll be looking at two tables table A and Table B Table A lists orders that are

5

00:00:20.670  -->  00:00:22.470
conducted for us shop.

6

00:00:22.620  -->  00:00:27.600
It specifies their region and their status so whether they were unpaid or whether they were paid.

7

00:00:27.870  -->  00:00:36.090
Table B list the same orders but an itemized description of those orders so it lists the order number

8

00:00:36.180  -->  00:00:42.060
the item that was sold within that order and the sales that were generated through the sale of that

9

00:00:42.120  -->  00:00:42.640
item.

10

00:00:42.870  -->  00:00:49.110
And as you can see orders in Table B can be duplicated because some orders consist of several items

11

00:00:49.230  -->  00:00:53.490
for example Order Number One consists of a chair and a desk.

12

00:00:53.580  -->  00:00:59.280
And so we're going to be looking at an example of an inner join between these two tables so basically

13

00:00:59.280  -->  00:01:07.770
we want to take the order number from table A and use that to join table a to table be also an order

14

00:01:07.770  -->  00:01:08.230
number.

15

00:01:08.280  -->  00:01:14.130
So basically we want to connect the status of the order where there was paid or unpaid to the item and

16

00:01:14.130  -->  00:01:15.650
the sales of the order.

17

00:01:15.870  -->  00:01:19.680
And currently this information is contained within two separate tables.

18

00:01:19.680  -->  00:01:25.950
We want to bring it together from this image you can see that when we join the two tables on the order

19

00:01:25.950  -->  00:01:31.430
number there will be two matches in the second table to order number one.

20

00:01:31.440  -->  00:01:34.580
There will be one match in the second table to order number two.

21

00:01:34.650  -->  00:01:41.220
There will be three matches to order number three in the second table and there is no matches 4 or number

22

00:01:41.220  -->  00:01:41.600
four.

23

00:01:41.610  -->  00:01:47.990
So because this is an inner join this row will be discarded from the final result.

24

00:01:48.270  -->  00:01:55.580
And what will happen now is as you can see there's less rows in the table left than on the table in

25

00:01:55.580  -->  00:01:55.850
the right.

26

00:01:55.850  -->  00:02:03.510
So every time there is a multiple match the two rows that have been matched multiple times will be replicated

27

00:02:03.510  -->  00:02:03.530
.

28

00:02:03.540  -->  00:02:05.990
So duplicate or triplicated and so on.

29

00:02:06.090  -->  00:02:09.870
So in this particular case the final table will look like this.

30

00:02:10.110  -->  00:02:16.290
And as you can see here some rows of the table on the left have been duplicated to match the number

31

00:02:16.290  -->  00:02:19.190
of rows and the table in the right hand is completely normal.

32

00:02:19.290  -->  00:02:24.040
So this is the way the final table will look in our output.

33

00:02:24.540  -->  00:02:28.850
So that's what happens when there are duplicate values in the column that we're joining on.

34

00:02:29.040  -->  00:02:32.110
I hope you enjoyed today's Tauriel and I look forward to seeing you next time.
