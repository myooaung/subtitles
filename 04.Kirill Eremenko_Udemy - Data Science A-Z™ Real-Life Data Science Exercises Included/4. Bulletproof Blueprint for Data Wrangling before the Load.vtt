00:00:01.680  -->  00:00:06.420
Last time I went on a rant about Excel and now you're probably thinking it's a horrible tool that will

2

00:00:06.420  -->  00:00:07.620
ruin your career.

3

00:00:07.620  -->  00:00:09.830
The truth is I don't have anything against Excel.

4

00:00:09.840  -->  00:00:14.610
You just have to know how to use it correctly for data science work and everything will flow smoothly

5

00:00:15.150  -->  00:00:18.520
and that's what I will teach you in this tutorial to start off.

6

00:00:18.570  -->  00:00:22.790
Let's copy the file from the original data folder into the prepared folder.

7

00:00:23.100  -->  00:00:28.950
You can now see how valuable it is to always have a copy of your original file in the case of a screw

8

00:00:28.950  -->  00:00:30.050
up.

9

00:00:30.150  -->  00:00:36.480
The next thing we need to do is to change the file extension from CSP to teach XTi like this.

10

00:00:36.480  -->  00:00:40.760
Note that if you cannot see your file extension you can easily fix this.

11

00:00:40.860  -->  00:00:42.850
Simply click anywhere in your folder.

12

00:00:43.140  -->  00:00:45.380
Then press alt on your keyboard.

13

00:00:45.390  -->  00:00:54.450
Now go into Tools Folder Options go into the View tab and and check the box that says hide extensions

14

00:00:54.510  -->  00:00:57.760
for known file types click OK.

15

00:00:58.050  -->  00:01:01.260
Now you should see the extension next.

16

00:01:01.260  -->  00:01:07.410
Open up Excel instead of dragging the file into Excel which will open it up within the program.

17

00:01:07.530  -->  00:01:13.790
And because this is now a text file this will force Excel to bring up the data import wizard.

18

00:01:13.860  -->  00:01:22.870
Go to file open no copy your folder path and pasted into the open window.

19

00:01:23.070  -->  00:01:29.290
Select all files in the bottom right and choose your file and click open.

20

00:01:29.490  -->  00:01:33.440
You can see that the import wizard has popped up in the first step.

21

00:01:33.450  -->  00:01:38.230
Make sure delimited is selected and click next.

22

00:01:38.310  -->  00:01:43.960
By default the tab delimiters selected and selected and change to comma.

23

00:01:43.980  -->  00:01:47.640
Also make sure that the text qualifier is set to quotation marks.

24

00:01:47.700  -->  00:01:52.650
You can see that the data preview has changed and your columns are being recognized correctly.

25

00:01:53.370  -->  00:01:58.470
Scroll through to the right to make sure all your columns have been picked up correctly.

26

00:01:58.480  -->  00:02:00.210
Now you can click next.

27

00:02:00.210  -->  00:02:02.540
Step three is the most important step.

28

00:02:02.570  -->  00:02:08.060
We're going to tell Excel not to guess our datatypes and instead import all of it as text.

29

00:02:08.070  -->  00:02:09.560
This is how you do it.

30

00:02:09.670  -->  00:02:15.450
Select the first column and then scroll to the very last column and selected while holding down the

31

00:02:15.450  -->  00:02:17.700
shift key on your keyboard.

32

00:02:17.700  -->  00:02:22.110
This selects all of your columns now and the column data format.

33

00:02:22.110  -->  00:02:25.950
Select text and click Finish.

34

00:02:25.950  -->  00:02:30.450
After a second or two the data will load and now all of it is recognized as text.

35

00:02:30.450  -->  00:02:37.350
Essentially this is the same thing as what notepad plus plus does but it's just easier to navigate as

36

00:02:37.350  -->  00:02:37.890
you recall.

37

00:02:37.890  -->  00:02:41.090
There are two things that we have to do in this phase of the.

38

00:02:41.340  -->  00:02:44.390
Fix up the dates and fix up the dollar amounts.

39

00:02:44.400  -->  00:02:47.760
Today we will add a third item to that list.

40

00:02:47.760  -->  00:02:53.830
First let's fix up the dates since all of our doors and TX the previous method won't work anymore.

41

00:02:54.060  -->  00:02:57.750
Simply changing the format of a column won't do anything.

42

00:02:57.790  -->  00:03:03.310
Follow me and I will show you a technique that works for text fields every time.

43

00:03:03.330  -->  00:03:04.820
Select the whole column.

44

00:03:04.980  -->  00:03:11.400
Now go to the data tab at the top and find text two columns and familiar with it pops up.

45

00:03:11.400  -->  00:03:17.580
This is the same wizard We used to import the text file only now we're using it for one specific column

46

00:03:17.580  -->  00:03:18.390
.

47

00:03:18.510  -->  00:03:24.900
Make sure delimited is selected and click Next now and check any type of delimiter we're dealing with

48

00:03:24.930  -->  00:03:27.330
only one coalman and therefore we don't need a delimiter.

49

00:03:27.420  -->  00:03:29.770
The TX qualifier doesn't matter either.

50

00:03:29.820  -->  00:03:31.250
Click next.

51

00:03:31.250  -->  00:03:32.990
Your column is selected at the bottom.

52

00:03:33.000  -->  00:03:38.820
All you have to do is change the column data format from General to date and specify which date format

53

00:03:39.150  -->  00:03:41.190
Excel will be dealing with.

54

00:03:41.460  -->  00:03:44.690
In our case it's month day year.

55

00:03:44.910  -->  00:03:51.480
Finally the destination here is x 1 which means that the new data will replace your old column.

56

00:03:51.480  -->  00:03:53.250
That is exactly what we need.

57

00:03:53.250  -->  00:03:58.580
Click Finish as you can see the dates have now been recognized by Excel correctly.

58

00:03:58.680  -->  00:04:02.980
Now we will change the format of the dates just as we did previously.

59

00:04:03.030  -->  00:04:07.660
Select the whole column right click and choose format cells.

60

00:04:07.770  -->  00:04:12.570
If your Excel has the format we need under the dates category then select it there.

61

00:04:12.570  -->  00:04:17.640
Otherwise go to custom and specify the format we need since we've used it before.

62

00:04:17.640  -->  00:04:22.230
Excel has saved it for us selected and click OK.

63

00:04:22.560  -->  00:04:25.890
Now dates are in the right format.

64

00:04:25.890  -->  00:04:29.910
Remember you need to do this procedure for every column that has dates in it.

65

00:04:29.910  -->  00:04:35.190
By the way you've probably noticed that this process is taking quite a while and we haven't even gotten

66

00:04:35.190  -->  00:04:37.090
to the Sosias stage yet.

67

00:04:37.440  -->  00:04:42.630
This is exactly what I meant when I said that ECL is about 70 percent of the work of a data scientist

68

00:04:42.630  -->  00:04:43.140
.

69

00:04:43.170  -->  00:04:49.360
This is the reality of things and that's why it's important to have a bulletproof e-tail framework.

70

00:04:49.380  -->  00:04:53.530
It not only saves you from errors but will also save you lots of time.

71

00:04:53.940  -->  00:04:55.100
OK let's get back to it.

72

00:04:55.110  -->  00:04:57.490
Now we are going to fix up the dollar amount.

73

00:04:57.510  -->  00:04:58.630
Similar approach.

74

00:04:58.650  -->  00:05:01.430
First we need to convert the text into a number.

75

00:05:01.470  -->  00:05:04.750
Select the whole column and click text to columns.

76

00:05:04.890  -->  00:05:08.250
Same thing delimited and no delimiter.

77

00:05:08.550  -->  00:05:13.090
In the last step for column data formats select general and click Finish.

78

00:05:13.620  -->  00:05:21.690
Now we can format the columns highlight the whole column and click Format Cells choose number two decimal

79

00:05:21.690  -->  00:05:25.660
places no thousands separator and for negative numbers.

80

00:05:25.680  -->  00:05:27.440
Select the option with a minus.

81

00:05:27.720  -->  00:05:28.630
Click OK.

82

00:05:29.120  -->  00:05:29.720
Purrfect.

83

00:05:29.730  -->  00:05:31.050
We've done the two things.

84

00:05:31.050  -->  00:05:32.340
Dates and balances.

85

00:05:32.340  -->  00:05:38.490
Now let's add the third item totalist viewing CACP files in excel through the text the method is safe

86

00:05:38.490  -->  00:05:41.630
and convenient but it comes with a price.

87

00:05:41.630  -->  00:05:43.010
Have a look at this feedback code.

88

00:05:43.020  -->  00:05:44.100
No we're here.

89

00:05:44.100  -->  00:05:47.800
You've probably already noticed these hashtags in some of the rows.

90

00:05:47.850  -->  00:05:52.430
If you click on the cell then in the formula bar you will see that it does have text.

91

00:05:52.430  -->  00:05:55.500
However it's replaced of hash tags in the display.

92

00:05:55.500  -->  00:05:57.690
This happens when the text is too long.

93

00:05:57.720  -->  00:06:04.440
Excel can only fit up to 256 characters into each cell which is formatted as Text.

94

00:06:04.500  -->  00:06:09.570
If you save the file now you will lose this data in order to fix the problem.

95

00:06:09.570  -->  00:06:14.430
Select the feedback column right click and select Format Cells.

96

00:06:14.730  -->  00:06:17.470
Select the general category and click OK.

97

00:06:17.850  -->  00:06:20.630
Now the comments are being displayed correctly.

98

00:06:20.630  -->  00:06:21.200
Great.

99

00:06:21.210  -->  00:06:22.460
Your file is ready to go.

100

00:06:22.470  -->  00:06:27.280
Let's save it click File Save As and from the dropdown.

101

00:06:27.300  -->  00:06:29.610
Select CXVII click save

102

00:06:34.080  -->  00:06:38.670
close excel and now you can delete the txt file.

103

00:06:39.120  -->  00:06:45.800
Let's have a look at the CSP file and notepad plus plus here you can see that there are no hashtags

104

00:06:45.800  -->  00:06:46.540
.

105

00:06:46.890  -->  00:06:55.200
The balances are being displayed without commas or dollar signs and if we scroll over to the right you

106

00:06:55.200  -->  00:06:59.250
can see that the dates are shown in the right format.

107

00:06:59.250  -->  00:07:06.210
The first row has been correctly recognized as 11th of August and the credit card numbers are still

108

00:07:06.210  -->  00:07:07.940
here.

109

00:07:08.340  -->  00:07:09.490
That's perfect.

110

00:07:09.510  -->  00:07:11.110
The file can be uploaded now
