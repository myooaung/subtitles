1

00:00:00,720  -->  00:00:04,510
OK so we have uploaded the file into our original data folder.

2

00:00:04,680  -->  00:00:07,560
Now we are going to perform some cleaning on it.

3

00:00:07,560  -->  00:00:11,990
We cannot change the file within the original data folder as we discussed.

4

00:00:11,990  -->  00:00:19,560
So what we're going to do is take this file and copy it and put a copy in the prepared folder.

5

00:00:19,560  -->  00:00:24,240
Now we can work with this file and make any changes that we need.

6

00:00:24,240  -->  00:00:27,170
So let's open up this file in Excel.

7

00:00:27,480  -->  00:00:33,860
We're going to bring up a copy of Excel and I'm just going to drag this file in to excel.

8

00:00:33,990  -->  00:00:37,590
Here you can see that has several columns and not many rows.

9

00:00:37,620  -->  00:00:43,950
That is because this is a demo file and we will work for a much larger file in the following sections

10

00:00:43,950  -->  00:00:45,390
of the course.

11

00:00:46,200  -->  00:00:53,490
So here you can see the different columns such as customer id name surname gender age date joined and

12

00:00:53,490  -->  00:00:54,720
balance.

13

00:00:54,720  -->  00:00:59,330
Now there are two specific things that you need to do of this file before you commence the upload.

14

00:00:59,640  -->  00:01:03,420
You need to fix up the dates and you need to fix up the bounces.

15

00:01:03,570  -->  00:01:05,690
So what do we mean by fix up the dates.

16

00:01:05,820  -->  00:01:12,060
Well dates can have different formats and we want to have a consistent format in all of our data in

17

00:01:12,060  -->  00:01:15,450
our database so that we know exactly how to work with it.

18

00:01:15,480  -->  00:01:21,720
Plus sometimes you might get a date from a European country that structures its format differently to

19

00:01:21,720  -->  00:01:27,300
the U.S. So you have to account for those things and make sure the format is consistent so your database

20

00:01:27,300  -->  00:01:31,040
can recognize the date wherever the original daughter came from.

21

00:01:31,080  -->  00:01:33,900
And the second thing is fix up the balance.

22

00:01:33,900  -->  00:01:39,780
We need to get rid of the dollar signs the commas and make sure the decimal places are represented by

23

00:01:39,810  -->  00:01:40,820
dots.

24

00:01:41,010  -->  00:01:42,540
So let's go ahead and do that.

25

00:01:42,570  -->  00:01:48,300
All you need to do is select the column that you're trying to fix so we just look at the format.

26

00:01:48,300  -->  00:01:56,400
At this stage and right click on it and select Format Cells here for date we're going to set a specific

27

00:01:56,400  -->  00:01:57,450
type of date.

28

00:01:57,480  -->  00:02:00,180
So under date we're going to select.

29

00:02:01,050  -->  00:02:08,520
It's actually not here for me so I'm going to have to go to special custom and I'm going to find date

30

00:02:08,520  -->  00:02:12,730
here and I'm going to change it to.

31

00:02:12,780  -->  00:02:21,560
This is the type the specific type of date that you need so it's y y y y hyphen m m hyphen d d.

32

00:02:21,810  -->  00:02:28,890
That is the best date format for databases because whether this data came from the US or whether you're

33

00:02:28,890  -->  00:02:34,350
working in the U.S. or whether you're working in the U.K. or any other country your database will know

34

00:02:34,350  -->  00:02:41,940
exactly that the month is and if it sees the year the first four digits then it will see the month as

35

00:02:41,940  -->  00:02:46,010
a second and then the date it will never confuse the month and the date.

36

00:02:46,170  -->  00:02:47,710
So we going to click OK.

37

00:02:48,030  -->  00:02:52,680
So you see the date has changed its format and now we're going to do a similar thing with the balance

38

00:02:52,680  -->  00:02:52,730
.

39

00:02:52,740  -->  00:02:57,750
We're going to format cells and now we're going to go to instead of currency we're going to go to a

40

00:02:57,750  -->  00:02:58,570
number.

41

00:02:59,130  -->  00:03:05,280
And here we're going to make sure this box is unchecked the use thousand separate because we don't want

42

00:03:05,280  -->  00:03:11,060
the commers decimal places to and will click OK.

43

00:03:11,070  -->  00:03:14,270
Now there we go so now there is no dollar sign.

44

00:03:14,310  -->  00:03:18,330
And there is no comma in the balance.

45

00:03:18,330  -->  00:03:19,190
So one more thing.

46

00:03:19,200  -->  00:03:26,610
If your country uses comma instead of a dot for decimal places then you will have to change the regional

47

00:03:26,910  -->  00:03:33,300
settings of your computer to to make sure this comma is changed to a dot because when we upload to a

48

00:03:33,300  -->  00:03:35,630
database you need a dot.

49

00:03:36,090  -->  00:03:38,890
So now this follows ready and let's have a look at it again.

50

00:03:38,910  -->  00:03:41,220
I'm going to close this.

51

00:03:41,310  -->  00:03:42,680
It's going to save it.

52

00:03:42,690  -->  00:03:43,320
Yes.

53

00:03:43,410  -->  00:03:44,310
Yes.

54

00:03:44,610  -->  00:03:52,890
And now what happens is if I drag the file back in here you will notice that the balance stays consistent

55

00:03:52,920  -->  00:03:55,410
like we changed it but the date changed.

56

00:03:55,440  -->  00:03:58,330
Again it's not the format that we selected.

57

00:03:58,650  -->  00:04:06,000
And this might be confusing but this the only reason for that is that Excel displays that date convenient

58

00:04:06,000  -->  00:04:11,190
to use so it looks at your regional settings and then it displays the data in that way just for your

59

00:04:11,190  -->  00:04:11,950
convenience.

60

00:04:12,000  -->  00:04:17,640
So the proper way to check your data is not through Excel so once you have modified it in Excel which

61

00:04:17,640  -->  00:04:23,430
you need to be looking at is programs like Notepad plus plus soldiers bring it up here.

62

00:04:24,080  -->  00:04:25,240
Here's notepad plus plus.

63

00:04:25,250  -->  00:04:32,400
And if we drag our data in there now you can see that the date is in the correct format as is the currency

64

00:04:32,400  -->  00:04:33,690
.

65

00:04:33,690  -->  00:04:40,830
If your daughter said is a very large there is a different program called EDID pad light and we will

66

00:04:40,830  -->  00:04:43,170
talk about that program later on in the section.

67

00:04:43,230  -->  00:04:50,570
So that's the two things that you have to make sure are prepared the dates and the dollar amounts.

68

00:04:50,760  -->  00:04:55,810
Once you've prepared those you're ready to proceed to uploading the other to the database.
