00:00:00.430  -->  00:00:03.400
In this tutorial we're talking about commons in SQL.

2

00:00:03.420  -->  00:00:07.550
Right away you might notice that the database has grown substantially.

3

00:00:07.560  -->  00:00:08.360
Please ignore that.

4

00:00:08.370  -->  00:00:12.990
That's just because I've been working on the next section of the course so our two tables are still

5

00:00:12.990  -->  00:00:16.880
here a list of orders and order breakdown and the rest.

6

00:00:16.950  -->  00:00:18.030
It's getting exciting.

7

00:00:18.030  -->  00:00:24.270
It's growing very quickly so with all of the rest of the tables and these items actually I should probably

8

00:00:24.270  -->  00:00:29.630
close that we will work in the next section of this course.

9

00:00:29.880  -->  00:00:34.930
Anyway coming back to our topic we're talking about comments.

10

00:00:35.100  -->  00:00:36.270
Let me show you something right away.

11

00:00:36.360  -->  00:00:41.850
If we select the top 2000 rows of this table at the top here you see this green light.

12

00:00:42.090  -->  00:00:47.680
Well in S Q Well comments are highlighted in green by default.

13

00:00:47.820  -->  00:00:52.520
And what this means is that this line of code will be completely ignored.

14

00:00:52.530  -->  00:00:55.980
It will be executed when you execute the script.

15

00:00:55.980  -->  00:00:58.000
So there are two types of comments in.

16

00:00:58.080  -->  00:00:59.570
Here you can see a multi-line comment.

17

00:00:59.580  -->  00:01:07.800
And that means that if I split it into many lines and then I typed in something else then it will still

18

00:01:07.860  -->  00:01:08.870
be commented.

19

00:01:08.970  -->  00:01:17.970
And for instance I can even delete these characters because the code for a multi-line comment or the

20

00:01:17.970  -->  00:01:22.890
way to specify Monsell and comments you start with a slash and then a star and you ended with a star

21

00:01:22.920  -->  00:01:23.920
and a slash.

22

00:01:23.970  -->  00:01:27.700
So just be careful here that this is not a backslash this is a normal slash.

23

00:01:27.720  -->  00:01:33.070
So basically the same two symbols but in the opposite order and you can create your own multiply in

24

00:01:33.070  -->  00:01:33.390
common.

25

00:01:33.390  -->  00:01:36.840
So for instance we could create a multi-line comment here saying

26

00:01:39.810  -->  00:01:42.870
this is my select state.

27

00:01:42.960  -->  00:01:43.290
And

28

00:01:46.560  -->  00:01:47.010
there we go.

29

00:01:47.010  -->  00:01:53.540
So now I've created Lamont's line comment and if I get this code it won't be won't be affected code

30

00:01:53.560  -->  00:01:53.750
.

31

00:01:53.790  -->  00:02:01.140
The second type of Calment that you can create is a single line comment and a single line common starts

32

00:02:01.140  -->  00:02:05.690
with NSU all starts of two minus signs after each other like that.

33

00:02:05.760  -->  00:02:12.760
And here I can maybe specify a description for this column for the person who reading this code.

34

00:02:12.930  -->  00:02:20.980
This column shows sales in dollars for instance.

35

00:02:20.980  -->  00:02:27.420
And now if I run this code again once again this part is not affecting the code is being completely

36

00:02:27.420  -->  00:02:28.010
ignored.

37

00:02:28.020  -->  00:02:36.210
So two types of Commons and rescue all the single line comment with the two minus signs fold each other

38

00:02:36.570  -->  00:02:43.040
and the multi-line comment with the slash and the star in the Starns lash as opening and closing symbols
