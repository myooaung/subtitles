1

00:00:00,510  -->  00:00:01,680
Thanks for checking this out.

2

00:00:01,740  -->  00:00:08,670
This is my full presentation that I gave a couple of months ago and I just wanted to give you some quick

3

00:00:09,000  -->  00:00:15,120
introduction or some background of what you'll be listening to just because the audience that was there

4

00:00:15,150  -->  00:00:16,870
they did have a bit more information.

5

00:00:16,890  -->  00:00:20,820
It was an industry event so they knew what they were signing up for.

6

00:00:20,820  -->  00:00:27,120
So where I work before is a company called Super it's an Australian superannuation fund in Australia

7

00:00:27,120  -->  00:00:27,150
.

8

00:00:27,150  -->  00:00:29,080
Pension funds are called super pension funds.

9

00:00:29,280  -->  00:00:36,210
And basically every full time employee in the country is according to that legislation has to contribute

10

00:00:36,210  -->  00:00:40,690
approximately 90 percent of their salary into a nation fund.

11

00:00:41,190  -->  00:00:48,900
And since Byrd is one of the Near the top ten of salvation funds in Australia and the biggest problem

12

00:00:48,900  -->  00:00:55,110
here was that people might have lots of special special accounts from different funds and you want them

13

00:00:55,110  -->  00:01:01,860
to consolidate their funds into one account right to basically your preferred to be with your superior

14

00:01:02,010  -->  00:01:08,850
one and therefore you can you contact them you send them forms to fill out and then they send these

15

00:01:08,850  -->  00:01:11,010
forms back to you in order to control it.

16

00:01:11,010  -->  00:01:17,030
So I suppose there is such a good job at getting members to consolidate or inviting them to consolidate

17

00:01:17,240  -->  00:01:23,410
that the inflow of requests coming back was so great that it was causing capacity issues.

18

00:01:23,430  -->  00:01:29,700
So there was a bottleneck actually of 40 day backlog in processing the incoming requests and that's

19

00:01:29,700  -->  00:01:34,720
where super decided to apply Dallasites to solve the problem.

20

00:01:34,890  -->  00:01:36,570
And I'm sure you'll pick it up from there.

21

00:01:36,600  -->  00:01:46,080
Enjoy the presentation as you have probably gathered outside a super intelligent design of one of the

22

00:01:46,570  -->  00:01:50,930
successes in this space.

23

00:01:51,210  -->  00:01:57,350
But I don't want a case I don't want to pass on to a jury.

24

00:01:57,350  -->  00:02:00,220
I want to understand the stakes.

25

00:02:00,290  -->  00:02:08,380
My guess is how are you going to make your way to become the next.

26

00:02:08,520  -->  00:02:13,730
It's so great.

27

00:02:13,870  -->  00:02:17,090
So we get paid.

28

00:02:17,380  -->  00:02:22,960
So those are all what exactly.

29

00:02:23,010  -->  00:02:24,660
All right.

30

00:02:25,970  -->  00:02:27,300
Just so everybody else

31

00:02:30,060  -->  00:02:41,840
is a matter of money was most cases it's interest to them their funds.

32

00:02:42,560  -->  00:02:49,330
So that's what during the year take a listen and go say Australia.

33

00:02:49,620  -->  00:03:09,070
Where else do they spend on members from their BASIC was the right place for you.

34

00:03:09,180  -->  00:03:23,040
For example 18000 people in August 2013 they were able to buy every 20 cents.

35

00:03:23,130  -->  00:03:30,620
Now this drastic response rate was due to a requirement called proof of identification being dropped

36

00:03:30,720  -->  00:03:30,920
.

37

00:03:31,020  -->  00:03:34,080
So easier for them to swallow.

38

00:03:34,510  -->  00:03:45,690
And finally in comparison to 65000 people of the age of consent now this increase in response rate of

39

00:03:46,110  -->  00:03:49,930
5 percent doesn't seem like it does make a big difference.

40

00:03:50,170  -->  00:03:55,360
And it was indeed Ju-Ju It does however focus on today.

41

00:03:55,600  -->  00:03:58,710
We're going to talk about the dark side of cigarettes.

42

00:03:58,920  -->  00:04:06,240
So if you look at these numbers 27 percent and take into account that we're sending tens of thousands

43

00:04:06,240  -->  00:04:11,940
of members you could imagine that is never really going to have a drastic inflow of income requests

44

00:04:12,120  -->  00:04:13,800
coming back into the bottle.

45

00:04:14,100  -->  00:04:21,480
And we noticed this was in March last year the one was not ready for such a high volume of requests

46

00:04:21,480  -->  00:04:22,270
coming in.

47

00:04:22,280  -->  00:04:27,560
In fact the more than a day back in November.

48

00:04:28,110  -->  00:04:34,590
So as you can imagine this is a successful campaign from a customer experience not so much.

49

00:04:34,770  -->  00:04:36,890
And for a member centric organization it likes and super.

50

00:04:36,900  -->  00:04:43,290
This was a major point of concern and that's when we decided to apply data science to improve the August

51

00:04:43,290  -->  00:04:43,890
compay.

52

00:04:44,160  -->  00:04:48,590
So that's what we're going to do now we're going to moderate that right now it's July 2014.

53

00:04:48,930  -->  00:04:54,060
The march campaign has just passed and we have the results and the august campaign is upcoming.

54

00:04:54,060  -->  00:04:59,350
And we're going to see how support applied Donna signs to fix the problem.

55

00:04:59,370  -->  00:05:03,750
So just to reiterate the challenges of the super American Pain First of all it's urgent if you don't

56

00:05:03,750  -->  00:05:08,460
get your members first you compare as will be true it is a resourcing might be a concern you might not

57

00:05:08,460  -->  00:05:12,180
have enough staff to process all the incoming requests.

58

00:05:12,180  -->  00:05:16,770
There may be tensions between departments because of that marketing might want to get to the members

59

00:05:16,770  -->  00:05:23,220
as quickly as possible and operations might be concerned with their capacity to process these requests

60

00:05:23,220  -->  00:05:23,580
.

61

00:05:23,610  -->  00:05:31,190
And finally the most important challenge the backlog which can detract from member experience and that's

62

00:05:31,190  -->  00:05:37,400
when some super decided to use data science to address these issues so how can you is that a science

63

00:05:37,570  -->  00:05:40,410
to improve something that hasn't even happened yet.

64

00:05:40,690  -->  00:05:42,360
Well the concept isn't that complicated.

65

00:05:42,520  -->  00:05:47,920
Thanks to the infrastructure that my colleagues have set up and the unlimited access that I have to

66

00:05:47,940  -->  00:05:56,180
daughter we can use the march campaign and mine it for data use that data together extract insights

67

00:05:56,320  -->  00:06:01,470
and then apply those insights to the August campaign to fix the errors even before they occur.

68

00:06:01,880  -->  00:06:05,900
And to do that let's start with the simplest thing that we possibly can.

69

00:06:05,930  -->  00:06:11,290
Let's Plaut the distribution of the incoming requests over time.

70

00:06:11,440  -->  00:06:12,610
And this is what it looks like.

71

00:06:12,940  -->  00:06:17,770
So on the horizontal axis you can see here the number of days working days are passed since we launched

72

00:06:17,770  -->  00:06:19,000
the campaign.

73

00:06:19,000  -->  00:06:25,740
The vertical axis is the number of requests we received in that particular day.

74

00:06:27,170  -->  00:06:32,100
As you can see the chart is a bit spiky So lets move it out a three day rolling average and all this

75

00:06:32,180  -->  00:06:33,400
converter bartÃ³k.

76

00:06:34,190  -->  00:06:38,870
And here you can see that this is an inside in its own right.

77

00:06:38,870  -->  00:06:44,130
First of all soon realize it comparing the volumes per day or drastically increasing they peak around

78

00:06:44,180  -->  00:06:47,290
8 and they quickly drop off but not to the end.

79

00:06:47,440  -->  00:06:55,250
We can still see more requests coming in even around 100 working days later.

80

00:06:55,670  -->  00:07:00,500
Okay so that's that's valuable you now know that you can expect a peak around day 8 and maybe you can

81

00:07:00,500  -->  00:07:01,720
do something about it.

82

00:07:01,730  -->  00:07:03,320
Now let's look at the chart.

83

00:07:03,440  -->  00:07:07,160
And by that I mean instead of plotting everyday separately all we're going to do is we're going to plot

84

00:07:07,250  -->  00:07:12,580
every new day on top of the previous one and so in a way we're going to see how the requests are all

85

00:07:12,580  -->  00:07:13,260
money in.

86

00:07:13,260  -->  00:07:15,750
From members we'll be piling up over time.

87

00:07:15,860  -->  00:07:17,570
And this is what that chart looks like.

88

00:07:17,560  -->  00:07:20,910
So it's a nice pretty smooth chart.

89

00:07:20,950  -->  00:07:22,350
What insights can we derive from here.

90

00:07:22,430  -->  00:07:24,420
Well let's look at the 50 percent line.

91

00:07:24,700  -->  00:07:27,950
When did we receive half of the requests.

92

00:07:28,060  -->  00:07:30,290
Well that happened at 13 days.

93

00:07:30,280  -->  00:07:35,360
So out of 100 over 100 days half of the request came in 13 days.

94

00:07:35,380  -->  00:07:36,900
Good insight.

95

00:07:36,920  -->  00:07:38,160
Let's try another thing.

96

00:07:38,150  -->  00:07:42,680
This is something I'm quite sure some of you in the audience are already familiar with the concept of

97

00:07:42,680  -->  00:07:46,640
the Pareto Principle that 80 percent of the effects come from 20 percent of the causes.

98

00:07:46,970  -->  00:07:49,560
Well let's see how that works in our case.

99

00:07:49,610  -->  00:07:50,710
That's a tip and line.

100

00:07:50,870  -->  00:07:54,240
And 80 percent of the requests came in at 31 days.

101

00:07:54,440  -->  00:07:58,000
So that's not exactly 20 percent but it's close enough.

102

00:07:58,100  -->  00:07:59,880
And what does this tell us.

103

00:07:59,890  -->  00:08:07,750
Well the daughter here is screaming at us that the most labor intensive period for this campaign is

104

00:08:07,750  -->  00:08:09,400
the first 31 days.

105

00:08:09,760  -->  00:08:14,590
You have to make sure that your staff are trained up they're focused you have enough people in the campaign

106

00:08:14,990  -->  00:08:17,710
and you have to avoid the backlog in those 31 days.

107

00:08:17,720  -->  00:08:22,010
And if you do then you can slowly start taking people off the project and putting them on other projects

108

00:08:22,010  -->  00:08:22,330
.

109

00:08:22,340  -->  00:08:28,470
After the 31 days Mark because as you can see the curve flattens out.

110

00:08:28,610  -->  00:08:30,600
So that's that's good.

111

00:08:30,600  -->  00:08:33,960
Now let's put them side by side and have a look at them.

112

00:08:34,120  -->  00:08:38,020
And now this is the part where this is where you get to see how scientists think.

113

00:08:38,020  -->  00:08:41,030
So looking at them was like I've seen this somewhere.

114

00:08:41,290  -->  00:08:44,320
I've seen this in one of my economics maths classes.

115

00:08:44,330  -->  00:08:50,290
This is so familiar and then it me it looks a lot like an ideal mathematical lognormal distribution

116

00:08:50,290  -->  00:08:50,770
.

117

00:08:51,080  -->  00:08:53,860
And let's just put them side by side and you see what I mean.

118

00:08:53,980  -->  00:08:56,110
You see that they're very similar.

119

00:08:56,380  -->  00:09:01,990
And this is where I embarked upon a journey to find out exactly what distribution it was.

120

00:09:02,000  -->  00:09:05,600
So just to make sure we're all up to speed we have a distribution here.

121

00:09:05,600  -->  00:09:07,220
Now we're trying to curve fit it.

122

00:09:07,250  -->  00:09:12,640
We're trying to find the right curve for this distribution and then find a name for that curve.

123

00:09:12,710  -->  00:09:14,490
And so I use a tool called easy fit.

124

00:09:14,500  -->  00:09:16,590
And once again thanks to Nathan brother.

125

00:09:16,660  -->  00:09:23,360
Like any tool agile process we can get our hands on very quickly as you can see it wasn't a log normal

126

00:09:23,360  -->  00:09:24,110
distribution.

127

00:09:24,250  -->  00:09:28,480
It wasn't a Pearson distribution it wasn't a gamma distribution.

128

00:09:28,490  -->  00:09:34,250
Had to try quite a few more and you know sometimes in life when you really really want something and

129

00:09:34,270  -->  00:09:36,940
just so determined to get it you eventually get it.

130

00:09:37,070  -->  00:09:38,400
Well this was one of those cases.

131

00:09:38,530  -->  00:09:41,030
It turned out to be a Frechette distribution.

132

00:09:41,170  -->  00:09:47,350
And at the time I had no idea what for sure distribution was had to go look it up and it turns out that

133

00:09:47,360  -->  00:09:52,280
a for shared distribution to use is used to model the behavior of floods in extreme weather conditions

134

00:09:52,270  -->  00:09:53,100
.

135

00:09:53,140  -->  00:10:01,860
How crazy is that members of a super fund will respond to a super massive campaign just like a dam response

136

00:10:01,880  -->  00:10:03,810
to extremely heavy rainfall.

137

00:10:04,290  -->  00:10:05,850
And right.

138

00:10:05,860  -->  00:10:06,370
Right.

139

00:10:06,430  -->  00:10:08,830
And that is why I love my job.

140

00:10:11,000  -->  00:10:17,300
It like you can like the only place you can come up with these things oh is only daughter can tell you

141

00:10:17,300  -->  00:10:22,520
this like you can come up with some leg up by yourself and no consultant in the world would be able

142

00:10:22,520  -->  00:10:25,760
to tell you this kind of thing only daughter can.

143

00:10:25,790  -->  00:10:27,380
And let's look at the chart here.

144

00:10:27,380  -->  00:10:31,140
You can see that they line up pretty well which is a good validation point.

145

00:10:31,350  -->  00:10:35,480
And then comes a question why why did we do this.

146

00:10:35,660  -->  00:10:40,560
If I take this Frechette submission to the operations department they'll say Carol this is really cool

147

00:10:41,220  -->  00:10:43,600
but what is the value in this.

148

00:10:43,830  -->  00:10:46,930
And that is when we take it to the next level.

149

00:10:47,270  -->  00:10:54,210
So the Frechette distribution Oh because the sample size is so large we can actually apply the law of

150

00:10:54,210  -->  00:11:00,440
large numbers which tells us that in essence tells us that we can use the dot information that we mine

151

00:11:00,500  -->  00:11:05,240
from the March campaign pledge the August campaign and predict what's going to happen.

152

00:11:05,550  -->  00:11:11,820
And so the for sure distribution is basically just a stepping stone for us towards the formulas the

153

00:11:11,830  -->  00:11:19,320
formulas these formulas describe the crowd behavior of members that we triggered with a Super Match

154

00:11:19,320  -->  00:11:24,840
campaign and now we have this intrinsic knowledge of how exactly they will behave as a crowd.

155

00:11:24,990  -->  00:11:30,950
We can create a model a model that will predict and forecast what will happen in August and that's exactly

156

00:11:30,960  -->  00:11:32,120
what I did.

157

00:11:32,230  -->  00:11:37,650
I create a tool which is a unique tool dedicated specifically to this campaign.

158

00:11:37,740  -->  00:11:43,080
We will go into details Abara about the controls of this tool but what I will say is that you can input

159

00:11:43,100  -->  00:11:43,160
.

160

00:11:43,160  -->  00:11:44,920
I can see some of your taking photos.

161

00:11:45,410  -->  00:11:46,220
Great.

162

00:11:46,430  -->  00:11:53,660
So what we can do about what we can do here is we can input the number of members we sending a complaint

163

00:11:53,660  -->  00:11:54,470
to.

164

00:11:54,480  -->  00:12:00,410
We can also input the number of lefties or staff that are processing this campaign when other responses

165

00:12:00,410  -->  00:12:03,400
come back in and will give us a forecast as folks on the chart.

166

00:12:03,770  -->  00:12:12,380
This campaign or this tool is currently set to the August data and you can see here that the red line

167

00:12:12,570  -->  00:12:19,520
is the forecasted volumes of response rates how they will be coming in in August and the blue line is

168

00:12:19,520  -->  00:12:22,070
our capacity to process those requests.

169

00:12:22,350  -->  00:12:28,660
And from here we can see that even with 20 staff on this campaign we will still see a massive backlog

170

00:12:28,660  -->  00:12:28,730
.

171

00:12:28,830  -->  00:12:34,830
Just like the one that happened in March and this is the part of the I was talking about we have done

172

00:12:34,830  -->  00:12:36,380
the predictive part of analytics.

173

00:12:36,410  -->  00:12:41,080
We can even predict the problem we can see it right there is going to happen if we don't act upon it

174

00:12:41,100  -->  00:12:41,680
.

175

00:12:41,850  -->  00:12:47,670
Now we're moving onto the prescriptive analytics how do we fix the problem before it even happens.

176

00:12:47,900  -->  00:12:54,300
Well the first thing that comes to mind is increase the number of staff on the job or even for a period

177

00:12:54,290  -->  00:12:56,160
of time to get rid of that backlog.

178

00:12:56,490  -->  00:13:02,120
Well what the DOT is telling us here is that you would need at least 45 to 50 staff processing this

179

00:13:02,120  -->  00:13:05,440
project in order to mitigate the backlog completely.

180

00:13:05,680  -->  00:13:10,830
And I'm sure none of you in this room have 50 of these just laying around waiting to be put on one single

181

00:13:10,830  -->  00:13:11,740
project.

182

00:13:11,750  -->  00:13:16,310
So that wasn't an option for some super and I had to come up with a different solution.

183

00:13:16,640  -->  00:13:21,720
And what this tool allows you to do is it allows you to break up your campaign and send it in batches

184

00:13:21,720  -->  00:13:23,850
and see how those Sinatras will work out.

185

00:13:24,020  -->  00:13:27,120
So let's have a look at a scenario here we've got two batches.

186

00:13:27,600  -->  00:13:29,550
Here's another scenario with three batches.

187

00:13:29,850  -->  00:13:34,420
And if we visualize the total curve of these three batches this is what it looks like.

188

00:13:34,710  -->  00:13:40,860
So here now you can see that if we break it up into three batches 10 days apart even with 20 staff we

189

00:13:40,860  -->  00:13:44,370
can easily process this campaign without any substantial backlog.

190

00:13:44,760  -->  00:13:51,560
And now going through the scenarios I was able to determine that the optimal solution here is five batches

191

00:13:51,750  -->  00:13:55,110
and we can drop the number of stuff on the project to 11 people.

192

00:13:55,760  -->  00:13:59,800
And that's that's that's exactly what we did.

193

00:14:00,000  -->  00:14:04,700
And now we're going to like looking at this it looks great in theory right.

194

00:14:04,710  -->  00:14:08,610
No backlog 11 stuff but we hear a lot of hype around data science.

195

00:14:08,670  -->  00:14:14,130
It's a cool trendy thing it's it's you know it's somewhere in the clouds that can help your organization

196

00:14:14,120  -->  00:14:14,140
.

197

00:14:14,150  -->  00:14:19,820
But you know it doesn't really actually work and the way we structured our data science departments

198

00:14:19,830  -->  00:14:27,480
and super was a keen focus on measuring success because we believe that success is the ultimate validator

199

00:14:27,810  -->  00:14:33,770
of how we can work together how we can work together to deliver value for the business.

200

00:14:33,770  -->  00:14:35,400
And that's what we're going to do now.

201

00:14:35,450  -->  00:14:37,040
This is our forecast.

202

00:14:37,110  -->  00:14:42,870
It's in blue what we're going to do is we're going to see how we measured the incoming requests.

203

00:14:42,870  -->  00:14:44,610
Week by week that's on super.

204

00:14:44,790  -->  00:14:50,000
And we're going to plot those over this chart in green and see how they compare.

205

00:14:50,000  -->  00:14:55,770
So there's our first two weeks there's another three weeks there's another three weeks and you can see

206

00:14:55,760  -->  00:15:01,940
the massive dip which was caused by the public holiday because the post office doesn't deliver mail

207

00:15:02,250  -->  00:15:05,230
on public holidays and therefore the spike on the next day.

208

00:15:05,630  -->  00:15:06,560
Here's another two weeks.

209

00:15:06,570  -->  00:15:11,400
And here is an operator error which I was looking at I could understand there was a public holiday.

210

00:15:11,390  -->  00:15:17,110
There was nothing that caused this and through dot we were able to pick this up very quickly and rectify

211

00:15:17,120  -->  00:15:18,460
it right away.

212

00:15:18,750  -->  00:15:24,000
And that that's also a valuable part of data that allows you to pick up things on the fly that you otherwise

213

00:15:24,000  -->  00:15:27,570
would have seen maybe a month two months or maybe never.

214

00:15:27,810  -->  00:15:34,020
Then here's another two weeks another three weeks another two weeks and the G20 public holiday in Brisbane

215

00:15:35,120  -->  00:15:36,370
and another week.

216

00:15:36,750  -->  00:15:44,810
And so as you can see the actual the Super Match applies very well to the forecast and what that allowed

217

00:15:44,820  -->  00:15:48,330
us to do was to deliver this campaign with 11 if he were ill.

218

00:15:48,370  -->  00:15:53,850
Rerolled in over 142 million dollars but what was more important we delivered an outstanding member

219

00:15:53,850  -->  00:15:54,800
experience.

220

00:15:54,880  -->  00:15:58,860
Were it just the backlog from 40 days to under three days.

221

00:15:59,340  -->  00:16:05,730
And if I could leave you with one thought from this presentation it would be that the door is there

222

00:16:05,730  -->  00:16:05,890
.

223

00:16:06,020  -->  00:16:09,530
You can all do all to this in your organization.

224

00:16:09,540  -->  00:16:11,660
A door is there you just have to look at it.

225

00:16:11,930  -->  00:16:12,290
Thank you

226

00:16:14,560  -->  00:16:20,020
.
