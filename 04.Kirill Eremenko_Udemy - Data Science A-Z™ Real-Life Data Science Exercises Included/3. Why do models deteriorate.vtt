00:00:00.480  -->  00:00:02.050
Why do models deteriorate.

2

00:00:02.100  -->  00:00:06.270
Now this is going to be an interesting tutorial because I can't just simply give you a blueprint or

3

00:00:06.270  -->  00:00:11.710
framework here because it can be literally a myriad of reasons why models did it.

4

00:00:11.890  -->  00:00:19.140
Nevertheless we're going to throw around some ideas so that you can see where which way to think.

5

00:00:19.140  -->  00:00:23.280
When you see the traditional model so maybe you will find the reason.

6

00:00:23.280  -->  00:00:23.550
All right.

7

00:00:23.550  -->  00:00:30.810
So we saw this we saw that a new model in 18 months can easily go from 81 percent you know rule of thumb

8

00:00:31.470  -->  00:00:33.330
assessment to 63 percent.

9

00:00:33.330  -->  00:00:34.410
What could be the reasons.

10

00:00:34.500  -->  00:00:39.900
Well let's have a look at some possible reasons additional factors for instance your model includes

11

00:00:39.900  -->  00:00:46.320
only some verbals And then there is actually another variable that appears that doesn't include a good

12

00:00:46.320  -->  00:00:55.290
example would be say in a factory you've got a model that measures that predicts defects but then you

13

00:00:55.380  -->  00:00:58.620
add a new component to your element that you're producing.

14

00:00:58.620  -->  00:01:04.090
So whether it's a tooth brush or something else whatever you're producing a car.

15

00:01:04.530  -->  00:01:10.230
So you want to fire you've added a new variable component but that variables obviously not include your

16

00:01:10.230  -->  00:01:15.890
model because it was built before that variable was added another one could be changes in behavior so

17

00:01:15.890  -->  00:01:22.140
if we're modeling the behavior of human beings like in the example the bank people might change the

18

00:01:22.150  -->  00:01:23.920
behavior why they change the behavior.

19

00:01:24.030  -->  00:01:25.200
That's a different question.

20

00:01:25.200  -->  00:01:30.480
It could be it could be a result of something else so that's like another effect that caused the change

21

00:01:30.480  -->  00:01:31.720
of the behavior.

22

00:01:31.770  -->  00:01:37.470
For example when smartphones came out they became so popular very quickly that maybe people all started

23

00:01:37.470  -->  00:01:43.590
banking with their smartphones and they don't like the color of your bank's app or your bank doesn't

24

00:01:43.590  -->  00:01:47.960
have an app something that changes in process so going back to the factory example.

25

00:01:48.030  -->  00:01:55.740
Maybe now your toothbrushes are being produced in a different way so maybe you've changed the conveyor

26

00:01:55.740  -->  00:02:02.590
belt somewhere or maybe you have excluded an additional step from the actual process of manufacturing

27

00:02:02.600  -->  00:02:02.640
.

28

00:02:02.670  -->  00:02:08.430
And that wasn't taken into account in your model previously and now it's not performing as well.

29

00:02:08.490  -->  00:02:13.500
Changes in existing factors going back to the example which are jumping around with examples here going

30

00:02:13.500  -->  00:02:21.180
back to the example of customers in a bank maybe the distribution of ages of your customers changed

31

00:02:21.180  -->  00:02:21.350
.

32

00:02:21.360  -->  00:02:28.380
So with tieless good one time customers get older and maybe obviously not as quickly as 18 months but

33

00:02:28.380  -->  00:02:34.080
maybe a couple of years because their customer base has gotten older and you haven't done anything to

34

00:02:34.110  -->  00:02:41.600
maintain that distribution curve as you had when you created the model and which is which can be fine

35

00:02:41.610  -->  00:02:47.970
maybe you're not aiming to get younger customers maybe you started as a young bank or a new bank and

36

00:02:47.970  -->  00:02:53.970
then your customers customers naturally aged over the period of five or 10 years and now obviously their

37

00:02:53.970  -->  00:02:55.420
behaviors are different.

38

00:02:55.490  -->  00:03:00.270
Their distribution of their age is different and therefore your model hasn't been adapted to the new

39

00:03:00.270  -->  00:03:01.030
customer base.

40

00:03:01.110  -->  00:03:05.910
So that could be a reason that's actually a good example because people get older the time.

41

00:03:05.910  -->  00:03:09.980
Models will also get older and people's behavior changes.

42

00:03:10.110  -->  00:03:14.670
And also the actual distribution of the variable age has changed.

43

00:03:14.670  -->  00:03:17.440
Whereas the model is expecting a different type of distribution.

44

00:03:17.700  -->  00:03:18.510
So there you go.

45

00:03:18.510  -->  00:03:23.820
That could be a reason competitor or maybe a competitor entered the market or multiple competitors have

46

00:03:23.820  -->  00:03:29.160
been entering the market and they have been changing things or they have been taking a share of your

47

00:03:29.160  -->  00:03:35.100
customers or more customers have been leaving disproportionately more to what the model is expecting

48

00:03:36.060  -->  00:03:38.100
changes in the industry.

49

00:03:38.100  -->  00:03:44.430
That also could be to do with competitors or maybe something say in your product has been introduced

50

00:03:44.430  -->  00:03:49.260
in the industry or maybe there's been a lot of consolidation in the street in the industry and other

51

00:03:49.260  -->  00:03:55.830
major players that are crowd that customers are gravity gravitating towards or the opposite maybe because

52

00:03:55.920  -->  00:04:02.010
companies have broken down into little ones or maybe it has been acquisitions or mergers or something

53

00:04:02.010  -->  00:04:06.920
like that that some something in this show you would know this if you have the intrinsic knowledge and

54

00:04:06.930  -->  00:04:13.350
you on top of things and something changes drastically or even slowly over time but still drastically

55

00:04:13.800  -->  00:04:20.270
you would hear about it and you would think that maybe that is causing the change in Malaysia.

56

00:04:20.270  -->  00:04:25.410
You will know what I'm talking about when you when you come across it when you see a change in the industry

57

00:04:25.620  -->  00:04:29.950
and you see it effect your model or you see a change in your model you will link the two.

58

00:04:29.980  -->  00:04:31.140
It's not.

59

00:04:31.260  -->  00:04:36.010
It's sometimes very obvious when this happens changes in regulation.

60

00:04:36.030  -->  00:04:41.470
That's a good one because it can actually really impact a model very quickly.

61

00:04:41.520  -->  00:04:48.340
Let's say something change in the regulations overnight and now a process has changed the way you do

62

00:04:48.340  -->  00:04:50.720
things has changed it has become different.

63

00:04:50.740  -->  00:04:55.360
For instance previously in order to get people to perform an action which you're measuring with this

64

00:04:55.360  -->  00:05:01.000
model you had to send them direct mail so you had to send them physical mail to get them to do something

65

00:05:01.000  -->  00:05:01.510
.

66

00:05:01.570  -->  00:05:05.650
Let's say it was to get their phone number.

67

00:05:05.710  -->  00:05:08.380
You don't have their phone number and you want their phone number.

68

00:05:08.380  -->  00:05:12.090
And this model is predicting the likelihood of people giving you their phone number.

69

00:05:12.160  -->  00:05:17.290
So previously in order to according to regulation in order to get their phone number you had to send

70

00:05:17.290  -->  00:05:18.810
them direct mail physically.

71

00:05:18.970  -->  00:05:23.980
But now the regulation has changed and you can send them electronic direct communications right idioms

72

00:05:24.400  -->  00:05:30.370
and they can reply by e-mail and give you their phone number that way of course it's going to be easier

73

00:05:30.370  -->  00:05:35.590
to get their phone numbers and therefore your model is not going to be performing as well because it's

74

00:05:35.590  -->  00:05:38.370
not used to this drastic change.

75

00:05:38.390  -->  00:05:39.340
It was expected.

76

00:05:39.340  -->  00:05:43.550
It's built for direct mails your or direct communications.

77

00:05:43.570  -->  00:05:47.170
Now you're sending a challenger communications completely different situation.

78

00:05:47.170  -->  00:05:51.110
You have to rebuild the model changes in product.

79

00:05:51.390  -->  00:05:57.490
That's there's another one maybe you're predicting how likely people are of obtaining a search product

80

00:05:57.490  -->  00:06:05.170
and then you release another product which is cannibalizing the demand for the first product.

81

00:06:05.170  -->  00:06:09.550
So you're kind of competing with yourself and the model doesn't take that into account so the model

82

00:06:09.550  -->  00:06:11.840
was built in the circumstance where we were.

83

00:06:11.860  -->  00:06:17.410
We are trying to understand here is that the image I'm trying to the message I'm trying to convey is

84

00:06:17.410  -->  00:06:21.010
that the model and model is built in a certain environment.

85

00:06:21.010  -->  00:06:25.060
It is nurtured grown and deployed in a certain environment.

86

00:06:25.060  -->  00:06:29.610
If the environment changes then the model might break.

87

00:06:29.620  -->  00:06:31.270
It might stop working.

88

00:06:31.270  -->  00:06:33.540
These things are very fragile.

89

00:06:33.600  -->  00:06:35.520
They can only work there.

90

00:06:35.680  -->  00:06:41.170
They're very powerful and strong when they work in the environment that where they were created as soon

91

00:06:41.170  -->  00:06:48.520
as something about the environment changes the more models can deteriorate and even break depletion

92

00:06:48.520  -->  00:06:48.800
.

93

00:06:48.800  -->  00:06:51.160
Haha that's that's an interesting one.

94

00:06:51.250  -->  00:06:59.830
If a model over time has used up the customers or the elements that it's modeling.

95

00:06:59.830  -->  00:07:07.030
So it's kind of it's kind of a vicious vicious cycle here so it doesn't apply always doesn't apply to

96

00:07:07.030  -->  00:07:13.810
almost only some situations so when you say you want to you want some action which is a one off action

97

00:07:13.810  -->  00:07:18.290
you can get that person that can repeat purchase or you can't get him.

98

00:07:18.310  -->  00:07:20.310
You don't even need to get him to do that actually.

99

00:07:20.310  -->  00:07:23.460
It's like that for example of providing a mobile number once you have the mobile number.

100

00:07:23.500  -->  00:07:23.830
That's it.

101

00:07:23.830  -->  00:07:30.970
That person's out of the out of the equation and perhaps you have you know our customer base is not

102

00:07:30.970  -->  00:07:37.920
growing that quickly and say you create a model on a a small sample like 10000 people.

103

00:07:37.960  -->  00:07:42.070
You created this model and then you want to apply it to your whole population.

104

00:07:42.070  -->  00:07:48.310
Well after you've applied it once and you've sent out the communications to get those phone numbers

105

00:07:48.310  -->  00:07:52.700
and you've gotten them from the most probable people to give them to you.

106

00:07:52.900  -->  00:07:53.610
That's it.

107

00:07:53.650  -->  00:07:58.000
When you if you apply the model again your population has changed right you you're not going to apply

108

00:07:58.000  -->  00:08:02.380
it to those people that already gave you a mobile number so you can apply to those that did it and therefore

109

00:08:02.380  -->  00:08:08.980
your model is not going to perform the same way because you've already depleted that potential for people

110

00:08:08.980  -->  00:08:10.800
to view mobile which is actually a good thing.

111

00:08:10.800  -->  00:08:15.570
So you've actually gotten the phone numbers just the thing is that you can reapply them moral not just

112

00:08:15.570  -->  00:08:15.900
so.

113

00:08:15.970  -->  00:08:17.430
Situations like that can occur.

114

00:08:17.520  -->  00:08:19.230
Be be careful of those.

115

00:08:19.700  -->  00:08:24.320
And number 10 what I think of your spontaneous changes I'll get this is an interesting one.

116

00:08:24.350  -->  00:08:32.620
Something in the industry company behavior regulations product any of these happen like very very quickly

117

00:08:32.680  -->  00:08:33.960
and unexpectedly.

118

00:08:34.300  -->  00:08:39.930
Why brought this one up because I wanted to show you as a bonus two additional examples of model titration

119

00:08:39.930  -->  00:08:40.280
.

120

00:08:40.290  -->  00:08:45.400
These are going to be a bit weird and they can be funny and they're going to be a bit challenging to

121

00:08:45.400  -->  00:08:46.980
understand so let's go ahead.

122

00:08:47.310  -->  00:08:50.970
So Example Number one is this one what do you think happened here.

123

00:08:51.100  -->  00:08:53.320
What does this look like to you.

124

00:08:53.320  -->  00:08:54.740
It looks weird right.

125

00:08:54.740  -->  00:08:59.590
It's you wouldn't think that the red line can be both above and below the blue line.

126

00:09:00.220  -->  00:09:04.270
But let me explain what happened here and I'm going to use my Mosse for this because this is important

127

00:09:04.270  -->  00:09:04.630
.

128

00:09:04.630  -->  00:09:09.880
So when you see something like this obviously something happened something went wrong.

129

00:09:10.030  -->  00:09:12.730
It's not just like gradual deterioration like this over time.

130

00:09:12.730  -->  00:09:14.940
This was like a spontaneous kind of thing.

131

00:09:15.370  -->  00:09:21.640
So what actually in fact happened here is the the way kind of to determine this is a look at the area

132

00:09:21.670  -->  00:09:29.800
under the I remember long time ago a couple sections ago we were talking about that the correct mathematical

133

00:09:30.510  -->  00:09:39.820
actually accuracy ratio is defined as the area under this model over here divided by the area under

134

00:09:39.820  -->  00:09:42.230
the perfect model which we can see over here.

135

00:09:42.610  -->  00:09:47.380
And what we're using is just a rule of thumb because it's faster and it's very visual.

136

00:09:47.380  -->  00:09:49.620
So look at that area and the curve here.

137

00:09:49.630  -->  00:09:50.250
What do you see.

138

00:09:50.260  -->  00:09:53.930
You see that the area under the curve has decreased.

139

00:09:53.980  -->  00:09:54.300
Right.

140

00:09:54.300  -->  00:09:57.450
So the more there's less area under the curve.

141

00:09:57.850  -->  00:10:08.630
What this is telling us is that the model is not predicting as many turners and in this particular case

142

00:10:08.630  -->  00:10:13.190
what exactly happened is the number of Turners drastically increased.

143

00:10:13.280  -->  00:10:19.340
And if you might be a bit weird to look at it this way but look at look what's happening so the most

144

00:10:19.340  -->  00:10:23.060
predicting prediction predicting is still predicting even though it's going under the blue curve doesn't

145

00:10:23.060  -->  00:10:23.600
matter.

146

00:10:23.690  -->  00:10:28.320
It's still predicting that people are leaving so as this is growing you are growing here.

147

00:10:28.340  -->  00:10:33.530
So as long as you're going up here that means you're getting more turners or more people that actually

148

00:10:33.530  -->  00:10:34.260
left.

149

00:10:34.310  -->  00:10:35.630
So just get of here.

150

00:10:35.630  -->  00:10:37.090
Then you have this drastic move.

151

00:10:37.150  -->  00:10:38.260
Bam very quickly.

152

00:10:38.260  -->  00:10:40.380
So basically here you are.

153

00:10:40.460  -->  00:10:45.990
Every single time you take a person from the horizontal axis you're picking up a lever.

154

00:10:46.070  -->  00:10:46.940
An actual Tzschirner.

155

00:10:46.970  -->  00:10:48.120
Then you pick up another person.

156

00:10:48.120  -->  00:10:50.490
He's also 10 or so here.

157

00:10:50.930  -->  00:10:52.990
It's every single time.

158

00:10:53.000  -->  00:10:54.440
It's spot on.

159

00:10:54.440  -->  00:10:57.310
You're hitting a person that's leaving.

160

00:10:57.350  -->  00:11:00.480
And then it starts predicting again of some sort of rate.

161

00:11:00.500  -->  00:11:07.970
So what is this is telling us is that before it looked like this before there was just a normal curve

162

00:11:07.970  -->  00:11:12.310
here so as you were picking up like a certain number of people some of them were burner's some of them

163

00:11:12.310  -->  00:11:14.090
are like people who left the company.

164

00:11:14.090  -->  00:11:14.820
Some of them weren't.

165

00:11:14.930  -->  00:11:18.470
But here they all became lever's of the come from the company.

166

00:11:18.470  -->  00:11:24.410
So what this is telling us is something drastic change in the industry that all these people that used

167

00:11:24.410  -->  00:11:31.910
to be here now all of a sudden have left or all of these people that's all this classification the people

168

00:11:31.910  -->  00:11:37.430
that were placed here according to the models classification have not left a good example of that is

169

00:11:38.000  -->  00:11:44.690
a categorical variable like let's say country let's say we have three countries right in our daughter

170

00:11:45.040  -->  00:11:49.970
data set and let's say all of these people are from Germany and these people are from France and these

171

00:11:49.970  -->  00:11:52.190
people say of course the model doesn't do that.

172

00:11:52.190  -->  00:12:01.290
But if there is a very distinct difference between the regions they might end up grouped together so

173

00:12:01.290  -->  00:12:05.750
that if everybody from Germany is much more likely to live than people from France and they're much

174

00:12:05.750  -->  00:12:10.080
more likely to leave than people from Spain then that's how the money is going to structure it so that

175

00:12:10.160  -->  00:12:14.750
just the progression will put people from Germany at the start then people from France and people are

176

00:12:14.750  -->  00:12:16.130
saying and then what happens here.

177

00:12:16.130  -->  00:12:18.300
Everybody from France decides to leave the bank.

178

00:12:18.320  -->  00:12:18.800
That's it.

179

00:12:18.830  -->  00:12:23.450
Maybe that's a good example of change in regulation maybe they're not allowed to bank with your bank

180

00:12:23.450  -->  00:12:23.860
anymore.

181

00:12:23.870  -->  00:12:24.710
That's it.

182

00:12:24.770  -->  00:12:28.840
Your bank has been prohibited of working in France.

183

00:12:28.850  -->  00:12:31.400
They all everybody in France is going to leave your bank.

184

00:12:31.520  -->  00:12:32.560
And that's what we're seeing here.

185

00:12:32.560  -->  00:12:38.660
That's why as soon as the model gets to the people that did it you previously placed in this part which

186

00:12:38.660  -->  00:12:43.930
were both from France and were kind of like a monetary risk of leaving.

187

00:12:43.940  -->  00:12:49.370
Now they're all leaving spontaneously and as you can see that is blowing up the model.

188

00:12:49.370  -->  00:12:50.620
So what would you do in this case.

189

00:12:50.780  -->  00:12:56.180
Well first of all if that is if you know the exact reason and you can see that there's this categorical

190

00:12:56.180  -->  00:12:59.920
wearable of course you would excluded from your maudling because you would treat them separately.

191

00:13:00.110  -->  00:13:06.650
You would you would treat the population of the bank or the people at bankruptcy in France who treat

192

00:13:06.650  -->  00:13:11.300
them separately because there's no point in modeling them they're all going to leave anyway.

193

00:13:11.300  -->  00:13:11.990
You already know that.

194

00:13:11.990  -->  00:13:16.790
What's the point in putting them in a model if it's not such a drastic change you just rebuild the model

195

00:13:16.820  -->  00:13:18.530
and you would try it.

196

00:13:18.650  -->  00:13:21.590
I see how that a comma is can be accommodated by the model.

197

00:13:21.830  -->  00:13:25.370
The other one we're going to look at is also a bit weird.

198

00:13:25.370  -->  00:13:26.820
What do you think happened here.

199

00:13:27.650  -->  00:13:32.660
And this is a great example actually of the fact that you can't always use the rule of thumb you can

200

00:13:32.660  -->  00:13:37.250
use the rule of thumb when morals are like normal like that when this happens.

201

00:13:37.310  -->  00:13:37.940
Look at this model.

202

00:13:37.940  -->  00:13:39.830
So here you can see that at 50 percent.

203

00:13:39.830  -->  00:13:41.500
This is by the way this is the same model.

204

00:13:41.510  -->  00:13:46.700
This model is the same as this model in which you can see here is that at 50 percent.

205

00:13:46.700  -->  00:13:51.430
This model is actually predicting a lot more so like nearly 89 percent.

206

00:13:51.740  -->  00:13:59.150
So the this rule of thumb assessment has gone up really well so this looks like a much better model

207

00:13:59.150  -->  00:14:00.580
if you assess it that way.

208

00:14:00.620  -->  00:14:05.900
But what is happening in reality is if you get over here this is the most predicting predicting predicting

209

00:14:05.900  -->  00:14:06.030
.

210

00:14:06.070  -->  00:14:12.650
And then once we get over here to these people that were placed somewhere between 60 percent and 80

211

00:14:12.650  -->  00:14:13.130
percent.

212

00:14:13.130  -->  00:14:14.950
So you get to these people.

213

00:14:15.230  -->  00:14:19.100
You're not picking up any libbers none of them are actually leaving the company or none of them are

214

00:14:19.730  -->  00:14:21.490
performing that action that you're measuring.

215

00:14:21.710  -->  00:14:25.550
So similar to this situation but the opposite here they all decided to leave here.

216

00:14:25.610  -->  00:14:27.880
Everybody in France decided to stay.

217

00:14:28.160  -->  00:14:30.850
Once again could be a regulation could be a new product could be.

218

00:14:30.950  -->  00:14:31.730
Maybe there were only.

219

00:14:31.730  -->  00:14:35.670
There were only two banks in France and one of them one of them just closed down.

220

00:14:35.960  -->  00:14:40.360
And that said you're the only one so everybody had to stay.

221

00:14:40.850  -->  00:14:41.770
It could be anything.

222

00:14:41.810  -->  00:14:47.780
But once again the in this case something happened something major happened and you can see that your

223

00:14:47.840  -->  00:14:48.380
model broke.

224

00:14:48.380  -->  00:14:51.860
So in this situation I wouldn't measure it with this rule of thumb.

225

00:14:51.860  -->  00:14:59.180
In fact I would do something about this categorical bearable because it is definitely doing something

226

00:14:59.180  -->  00:15:00.800
wrong to the model.

227

00:15:00.800  -->  00:15:03.260
And also you have to rebuild or retrain them all.

228

00:15:03.320  -->  00:15:09.860
Speaking of rebuilding and retraining That's our next topic now that we know what it looks like when

229

00:15:09.860  -->  00:15:13.670
models deteriorate and why they can deteriorate.

230

00:15:13.900  -->  00:15:14.150
How.

231

00:15:14.180  -->  00:15:21.230
It's about time that we talked about maintaining our models and making sure that they're nice and fresh

232

00:15:21.440  -->  00:15:22.370
all the time.

233

00:15:22.880  -->  00:15:25.110
And we will talk about that in the next tutorial
