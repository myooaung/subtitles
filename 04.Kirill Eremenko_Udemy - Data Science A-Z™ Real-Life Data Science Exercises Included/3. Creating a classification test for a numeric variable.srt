00:00:01,220  -->  00:00:07,620
The tutorial we visualized our distribution of customers by age bands and we talked about Binz.

2

00:00:07,620  -->  00:00:11,830
We created a new categorial variable for age when it's been.

3

00:00:12,030  -->  00:00:14,310
And we created this amazing chart.

4

00:00:14,310  -->  00:00:19,260
Now let's go ahead and save this worksheet as age distribution

5

00:00:22,740  -->  00:00:29,020
and also let's just save our work book in general because we haven't done that in a while.

6

00:00:29,370  -->  00:00:34,650
And now what we're going to do is create a new chart and let's have a look here.

7

00:00:34,710  -->  00:00:36,600
Now we know dimensions.

8

00:00:36,720  -->  00:00:40,830
You'll notice that we have a new dimension which is age been oh wow what a surprise.

9

00:00:40,830  -->  00:00:41,960
Where did that come from.

10

00:00:42,180  -->  00:00:45,570
Well you know we created that in the previous tutorial.

11

00:00:45,600  -->  00:00:52,140
So what do we want to do now is hello we take advantage of this and go ahead and create a kind of like

12

00:00:52,140  -->  00:00:55,850
an A B test that we were doing previously or a classification test.

13

00:00:55,860  -->  00:01:01,950
But now with this new variable so we already have our tests here so let's take one of them and say this

14

00:01:01,950  -->  00:01:11,240
one and we'll duplicate the sheet we'll move the sheet to the end and we will call this H.

15

00:01:11,310  -->  00:01:17,300
Just call it age because that will tell us that it's on distribution because it doesn't have the word

16

00:01:17,310  -->  00:01:18,140
distribution.

17

00:01:18,330  -->  00:01:26,010
And now we'll just take Age been and will drag it to replace active member and let's make some space

18

00:01:26,010  -->  00:01:27,030
.

19

00:01:27,030  -->  00:01:31,660
What I'd like to do here is get rid of the text label because it's taking up too much space.

20

00:01:32,000  -->  00:01:38,820
Maybe let's string this now because there's less labels.

21

00:01:38,820  -->  00:01:39,700
So there you go.

22

00:01:39,750  -->  00:01:45,480
As you can see we've got a beautiful distribution or actually test this is not distribution.

23

00:01:45,540  -->  00:01:47,410
These are percentages.

24

00:01:47,640  -->  00:01:50,910
It's a beautiful test has been already created for us.

25

00:01:51,030  -->  00:01:53,320
And how quick was that.

26

00:01:53,340  -->  00:01:55,140
I just just want to focus on that for a second.

27

00:01:55,140  -->  00:01:57,510
How quick did we create this test.

28

00:01:57,510  -->  00:01:59,810
It's amazing what what can we see from here.

29

00:01:59,940  -->  00:02:03,450
Well we still have all average line as you remember from the previous section.

30

00:02:03,450  -->  00:02:09,480
That's how many people leave the company or from the sample how many people left over the period of

31

00:02:09,480  -->  00:02:09,720
time.

32

00:02:09,720  -->  00:02:12,900
So if take out age and remove it.

33

00:02:12,900  -->  00:02:19,810
You'll see that right away that's our Eddie 80:20 split of people who stayed and left some going to

34

00:02:19,810  -->  00:02:21,800
price controls had to return age.

35

00:02:21,840  -->  00:02:25,040
So that's how average that's how people live.

36

00:02:25,290  -->  00:02:29,630
So here he comes here in a way that people in the lower age bands are less likely to leave.

37

00:02:29,640  -->  00:02:36,050
And people in the higher age bands are also much less likely to leave people that do leave quite a lot

38

00:02:36,120  -->  00:02:43,230
or that age bands that are most at risk are these age bands are here between 45 and 60.

39

00:02:43,440  -->  00:02:47,290
So 40 and 65 they're about average even though four is a bit higher.

40

00:02:47,340  -->  00:02:54,990
But between 45 and 65 years old people are at a very high risk of being so those are the customers that

41

00:02:54,990  -->  00:03:01,860
are for some reason leaving this bank and that is something that you need to like something that can

42

00:03:01,860  -->  00:03:06,930
be put in to report and investigate that further understand why these customers are leaving white customers

43

00:03:06,930  -->  00:03:13,920
between 35 and 40 are less affected or in between because customers between 25 and 40 or less affected

44

00:03:14,250  -->  00:03:16,600
and so on why these customers are not affected.

45

00:03:16,620  -->  00:03:22,350
So that would have been already great insights but at the same time remember that thing we talked about

46

00:03:22,350  -->  00:03:29,610
that you have to make sure that you're avoiding anomalies like or kind of anomalies that are not there

47

00:03:29,610  -->  00:03:37,680
or they're Ju-Ju insignificance of your test or the they are there because there's a lack of records

48

00:03:37,680  -->  00:03:37,870
.

49

00:03:37,890  -->  00:03:42,780
So here you can see right away there's a couple of those that might be suspicious.

50

00:03:42,780  -->  00:03:48,210
For instance 100 percent here 100 percent 100 percent it doesn't because these are the tails of your

51

00:03:49,560  -->  00:03:51,990
distributions or not the distribution or age distribution.

52

00:03:51,990  -->  00:03:58,410
The one that we looked at previously because they are the tails of the distribution they might be not

53

00:03:58,620  -->  00:04:00,370
too many records here.

54

00:04:00,570  -->  00:04:04,330
And so how do you check that everything is going smoothly.

55

00:04:04,350  -->  00:04:07,130
Well we'll find that out in the next tutorial.

56

00:04:07,140  -->  00:04:13,560
I will show you how to combine the two charts how to combine your age distribution chart and your test

57

00:04:13,560  -->  00:04:20,220
chart so that you can very quickly visually assess what is a significant result and what is a non-significant

58

00:04:20,220  -->  00:04:20,810
result.

59

00:04:21,030  -->  00:04:24,690
And I look for the next tutorial and until then I'd be analyzing
