1

00:00:00,930  -->  00:00:04,100
All right so we're nearly done creating our first Bill de Proc..

2

00:00:04,130  -->  00:00:07,260
And in fact we've done most of the groundwork already.

3

00:00:07,290  -->  00:00:12,090
So we have the create table bit and we have the insert into it.

4

00:00:12,240  -->  00:00:19,530
So today we're just going to add a bit more functionality to make it more versatile So let's say for

5

00:00:19,530  -->  00:00:22,440
instance I've already inserted the data right.

6

00:00:22,440  -->  00:00:24,990
So if I go to the top thousand rows the data is here.

7

00:00:25,140  -->  00:00:32,070
But let's say for instance that I had to refresh my old data file because somebody supplied me a new

8

00:00:32,070  -->  00:00:37,470
data file or something changed and some some reason then I want to rerun this bit.

9

00:00:37,470  -->  00:00:44,190
Well I can't just run it right now if I insert into then I will increase the number of rows I will get

10

00:00:44,190  -->  00:00:50,770
duplicate rows so I need to truncate my table first so get rid of all the dotted here and then run it

11

00:00:50,780  -->  00:00:50,950
.

12

00:00:51,270  -->  00:00:58,770
So I can do that I can to create a new query and type it in here truncate that table and so on but this

13

00:00:58,770  -->  00:00:59,820
happens quite often.

14

00:00:59,820  -->  00:01:05,460
So how about we add some functionality into a proc that will take care of those things.

15

00:01:05,460  -->  00:01:11,040
So what I'm suggesting is we take this bit insert into and we copy it.

16

00:01:11,070  -->  00:01:19,230
So this just Hetter of the section and then we pasted here above and we call this part just truncate

17

00:01:19,710  -->  00:01:29,370
table and here we will say what are we going to say which is going to say truncate table this table

18

00:01:29,380  -->  00:01:30,190
.

19

00:01:30,690  -->  00:01:37,500
And it might seem dangerous but in reality there is nothing dangerous about putting this code above

20

00:01:37,500  -->  00:01:44,580
the insert statement so if we've just created the table and we're about to insert data into it there's

21

00:01:44,580  -->  00:01:50,070
no problem running a truncate in between because there is a there isn't anything in the table anyway

22

00:01:50,100  -->  00:01:55,860
so we can after the create table if we're going to run this as one block once when we want to we run

23

00:01:55,860  -->  00:02:01,170
the whole thing if we run it like that that's a problem not a problem because the truncate is just going

24

00:02:01,170  -->  00:02:02,880
to truncate an empty table that's good.

25

00:02:02,940  -->  00:02:07,500
But if we don't want to you're on the create table bit we just want to run the insert then we just select

26

00:02:07,500  -->  00:02:12,020
from the bottom up to the truncate including the truncate and we run.

27

00:02:12,030  -->  00:02:18,150
And then we're only going to have the 43 rows so we empty the table and then we rerun the upload from

28

00:02:18,150  -->  00:02:19,340
the file.

29

00:02:19,350  -->  00:02:25,920
So that's one handy feature that you can add to your proc and I recommend doing that because whenever

30

00:02:25,920  -->  00:02:31,310
you need to insert into that will help you avoid the mistake of having duplicate records.

31

00:02:31,320  -->  00:02:37,410
And you know doubling up on your data and other one that we're going to add is at the top here.

32

00:02:37,590  -->  00:02:43,320
We're going to say now we're going to copy this bit and sort of truncate table we're going to put in

33

00:02:43,380  -->  00:02:44,630
a drop table.

34

00:02:44,660  -->  00:02:48,460
This is the part where people get scared like whoa we're going to drop the table.

35

00:02:48,900  -->  00:02:49,680
So let's type it in.

36

00:02:49,680  -->  00:02:52,610
So if object id this is an if statement.

37

00:02:52,630  -->  00:02:57,590
We haven't discussed them in as well but we're going to be using them much.

38

00:02:57,600  -->  00:03:03,270
We're only going to be using them to check if tables exist so if this table you need to take the table

39

00:03:03,300  -->  00:03:08,910
without the square brackets and then put it into quotation marks for basically a string.

40

00:03:08,910  -->  00:03:13,080
So this is now the name of the table as a string if it is not.

41

00:03:13,100  -->  00:03:14,520
So just copy this text.

42

00:03:14,520  -->  00:03:23,720
You don't have to like memorize it you can just copy it every time into a new prox drop table loops

43

00:03:24,470  -->  00:03:25,590
table.

44

00:03:25,770  -->  00:03:27,110
Then I want to drop the table.

45

00:03:27,330  -->  00:03:28,260
So why are we doing that.

46

00:03:28,260  -->  00:03:31,850
Well because you can drop the table.

47

00:03:32,170  -->  00:03:36,550
I'll just explain why the if statement is required you can drop the table here once.

48

00:03:36,570  -->  00:03:38,160
Yes I dropped it it's no longer there.

49

00:03:38,160  -->  00:03:39,030
Refresh.

50

00:03:39,030  -->  00:03:39,930
No table here.

51

00:03:39,930  -->  00:03:40,960
Not anymore.

52

00:03:41,430  -->  00:03:47,130
But then if I want to drop it again if I want to run this proc again while there the table is not there

53

00:03:47,130  -->  00:03:48,540
if I execute I'll get an error.

54

00:03:48,600  -->  00:03:51,620
And it's not nice doesn't feel nice.

55

00:03:51,630  -->  00:03:55,030
You know in a professional procedure to get an error.

56

00:03:55,050  -->  00:03:56,790
So that's where we put this statement.

57

00:03:56,790  -->  00:03:58,960
And in this case it won't drop.

58

00:03:58,980  -->  00:04:04,970
It won't even attempt to drop the table if the table is not has not been created.

59

00:04:05,050  -->  00:04:07,020
Is not in existence.

60

00:04:07,230  -->  00:04:09,590
So that's why we have the if statement.

61

00:04:09,690  -->  00:04:16,750
Now returning to why the drop well drop is a very dangerous operation it completely destroys the table

62

00:04:16,870  -->  00:04:18,590
for even asking you second time.

63

00:04:18,840  -->  00:04:20,320
So be careful with it.

64

00:04:20,340  -->  00:04:22,210
Don't drop tables that you can recreate.

65

00:04:22,320  -->  00:04:26,940
But in this case if we're running the proc for the first time it's not a problem to have the drop at

66

00:04:26,940  -->  00:04:33,540
the top because we you and how Intiman created the table yet so easy like that we run it and the table

67

00:04:33,540  -->  00:04:34,330
gets created.

68

00:04:34,380  -->  00:04:35,230
So we look here.

69

00:04:35,250  -->  00:04:42,060
Refresh tables created and then it's not a problem to have the drop off to the Create before the create

70

00:04:42,060  -->  00:04:47,580
table because if our intention is to create a table then we already know that we don't want the table

71

00:04:47,580  -->  00:04:49,350
that we have that it really exists.

72

00:04:49,370  -->  00:04:53,950
We've either backed it up or we we know that we want to override it.

73

00:04:53,970  -->  00:04:59,790
So in that case the drop is just handy to have because then when when you want to create the table if

74

00:04:59,790  -->  00:05:01,510
I just do that now I get an error.

75

00:05:01,530  -->  00:05:04,500
But because the table already exists as we discussed.

76

00:05:04,500  -->  00:05:09,030
So all I have to do is just highlight up to the top up to the drop table.

77

00:05:09,250  -->  00:05:14,090
And so as you can see now you have elements of your search procedure you have the dropdown sums.

78

00:05:14,100  -->  00:05:17,840
I'll just zoom out for a bit so we can see the whole picture.

79

00:05:17,880  -->  00:05:22,680
You've got this element at the top which is a drop table you've got the create table element you got

80

00:05:22,680  -->  00:05:25,340
the truncate table and you got the insert into.

81

00:05:25,500  -->  00:05:31,340
And so now if you ever want to rerun the whole procedure from start to finish you just select everything

82

00:05:31,390  -->  00:05:34,780
click execute it will drop the table creating a table.

83

00:05:34,800  -->  00:05:36,650
Truncate the table which does nothing.

84

00:05:36,660  -->  00:05:37,840
Insert into the table.

85

00:05:38,010  -->  00:05:43,770
If you ever want to just reinsert data into the table before recreating it just run Lisbet.

86

00:05:44,070  -->  00:05:48,780
So very very flexible on what you can do with your tables.

87

00:05:49,260  -->  00:05:53,960
And that is us that's how we create a stored procedure.

88

00:05:54,150  -->  00:05:58,780
And in the next tutorial we will discuss what we have created in a bit more detail
