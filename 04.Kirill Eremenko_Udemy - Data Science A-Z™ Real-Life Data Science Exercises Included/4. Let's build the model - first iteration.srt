00:00:00,570  -->  00:00:07,230
Welcome back to your ultimate data science course this is curial are a Manco as always and to day is

2

00:00:07,350  -->  00:00:08,110
go time.

3

00:00:08,220  -->  00:00:12,820
We are building our first Geo demographic segmentation model.

4

00:00:12,840  -->  00:00:15,780
Hope you're excited about this because I'm super pumped.

5

00:00:15,780  -->  00:00:17,660
And let's get straight into it.

6

00:00:17,700  -->  00:00:25,200
So I'm going to open up Grettel and now I'm going to open our to set some minds on my desktop as usual

7

00:00:25,540  -->  00:00:29,190
Mullings S. Joe demographic segmentation.

8

00:00:29,400  -->  00:00:35,310
It's a CACP file so not the test data we're looking for that chern a modeling Dotsie as we open that

9

00:00:35,310  -->  00:00:36,530
up.

10

00:00:36,540  -->  00:00:37,190
Nope.

11

00:00:37,470  -->  00:00:38,620
OK.

12

00:00:38,910  -->  00:00:43,740
So here we've got a list of categorical variables.

13

00:00:43,830  -->  00:00:47,590
We've got the surname which won't be using so we don't care about that.

14

00:00:47,700  -->  00:00:52,710
Then we've got the geography which has three categories and we've got genda which has two carriers so

15

00:00:52,710  -->  00:00:56,250
we need to take care of those right away and that's what we're going to do now.

16

00:00:56,370  -->  00:00:59,980
We're going to create dummy variables for geography and gender.

17

00:01:00,240  -->  00:01:07,050
So let's go add dummys gender and dummys geography.

18

00:01:07,400  -->  00:01:08,030
OK.

19

00:01:08,040  -->  00:01:09,330
Hope you're following along.

20

00:01:09,570  -->  00:01:13,700
So we're going to recode these now added attributes.

21

00:01:13,740  -->  00:01:17,920
France I'm going to go to France next.

22

00:01:17,940  -->  00:01:23,570
Spain and Germany.

23

00:01:23,700  -->  00:01:28,200
So we just basically changing the names so that it's easier for us to navigate.

24

00:01:28,260  -->  00:01:36,830
Now they have proper names and gender same thing added attributes female and male.

25

00:01:37,160  -->  00:01:39,670
OK good.

26

00:01:40,440  -->  00:01:41,980
So that took us about a minute.

27

00:01:42,120  -->  00:01:47,710
Now we want to run our model as you can see there's so many variables.

28

00:01:47,910  -->  00:01:49,620
It's going to be very exciting.

29

00:01:49,620  -->  00:01:50,610
All right.

30

00:01:50,610  -->  00:01:54,100
Model limited logit binary.

31

00:01:54,860  -->  00:01:57,520
OK so now let's take our exited variable.

32

00:01:57,570  -->  00:01:59,800
That's the variable that we're trying to model.

33

00:01:59,820  -->  00:02:02,510
We're trying to predict if a person is going to exit or not.

34

00:02:02,640  -->  00:02:07,140
So that's how dependent variable I will set as default because we're going to be running a lot of these

35

00:02:09,000  -->  00:02:09,890
models.

36

00:02:10,340  -->  00:02:17,350
Now as you remember we the bank had a snapshot of 10000 people at a certain point in time and then it

37

00:02:17,350  -->  00:02:18,830
watched which one of them.

38

00:02:18,930  -->  00:02:22,570
Which ones of them exited and which ones stayed.

39

00:02:22,740  -->  00:02:24,960
So that's why exit as our dependent variable.

40

00:02:24,960  -->  00:02:28,320
Now let's look at the other variables that we want in our regressors.

41

00:02:28,380  -->  00:02:32,620
So row number doesn't affect whether a person exits or not.

42

00:02:32,620  -->  00:02:36,120
Customer ID same thing surname same thing.

43

00:02:36,120  -->  00:02:41,520
So those are obvious obviously not going to be a normal credit score that could be a regressive credit

44

00:02:41,520  -->  00:02:47,040
score could affect or could be associated so the effect is probably not the right word when you're talking

45

00:02:47,040  -->  00:02:52,190
about logistic regression because there is no actual causation.

46

00:02:52,200  -->  00:02:54,820
What we're talking about here is a sociate Association.

47

00:02:54,840  -->  00:03:01,320
Is his credit score associated with people exiting and that's important to understand that his other

48

00:03:01,320  -->  00:03:02,870
credit score makes them leave.

49

00:03:02,880  -->  00:03:04,720
It's the people that leave.

50

00:03:04,770  -->  00:03:09,330
Do they have a certain type of credit score or can we describe them by looking at their credit score

51

00:03:09,330  -->  00:03:14,100
and say for instance people of high credit scores are more likely to leave than people with low credit

52

00:03:14,100  -->  00:03:16,350
score so that's sort effect that's association.

53

00:03:16,590  -->  00:03:19,780
But sometimes you'll hear me say effect.

54

00:03:20,040  -->  00:03:23,400
Just think of association when you're talking about logistic regression.

55

00:03:23,400  -->  00:03:26,910
In any case so credit score geography and gender.

56

00:03:26,940  -->  00:03:30,720
We won't be using these two because we've created dummy variables which are at the bottom and we'll

57

00:03:30,720  -->  00:03:32,070
get to them in a second.

58

00:03:32,370  -->  00:03:38,250
Age age could affect or age could be associated with people leaving or staying with the bank.

59

00:03:38,250  -->  00:03:39,540
Good tenure.

60

00:03:39,540  -->  00:03:43,980
So how long has the person been of the bank because they are a loyal customer or is this somebody who

61

00:03:43,980  -->  00:03:45,790
just joined the bank recently.

62

00:03:45,900  -->  00:03:52,370
That probably could also determine whether a person is going to leave or not balance.

63

00:03:52,410  -->  00:03:58,440
So how much money does a person now the bank how affluent is he or she number of products how many products

64

00:03:58,440  -->  00:04:02,170
does this person have if a bank a very good one it's its stickiness.

65

00:04:02,170  -->  00:04:08,370
It's what share of the wallet does the bank have does the bank have a does the person have a mortgage

66

00:04:08,370  -->  00:04:09,260
loan with the bank.

67

00:04:09,270  -->  00:04:14,290
Does a person have a credit card does a person have an a savings account.

68

00:04:14,310  -->  00:04:18,480
How many of these products or more products as you can imagine the more pros you have the harder it

69

00:04:18,480  -->  00:04:20,100
is for you to leave the bank.

70

00:04:20,100  -->  00:04:21,190
So we'll put that in.

71

00:04:21,330  -->  00:04:23,040
Has a credit card or not.

72

00:04:23,100  -->  00:04:29,670
That's a that's kind of a subset of number of products so this is a one a yes no variable but it's already

73

00:04:29,670  -->  00:04:37,290
been coded for us by the kindly by the I.T. department into a one in a zero so we don't have to create

74

00:04:37,290  -->  00:04:42,900
dummy variables because it is already in essence a dummy variable and does a person have a credit card

75

00:04:42,900  -->  00:04:44,400
of the bank or not does that.

76

00:04:44,400  -->  00:04:46,230
Is that associated with them leaving.

77

00:04:46,440  -->  00:04:48,490
Can that help us classify the people.

78

00:04:48,660  -->  00:04:50,020
So put that in as well.

79

00:04:50,070  -->  00:04:54,800
He's an active member so active member is an interesting one.

80

00:04:54,840  -->  00:04:56,870
Different companies define that differently.

81

00:04:56,880  -->  00:05:05,100
And it's also good metric to have for any company because it kind of tracks how frequently your customers

82

00:05:05,100  -->  00:05:13,350
engage with you and what they do on the Web site what they do with all of your services and so on.

83

00:05:13,350  -->  00:05:21,150
So in this case it could be that has the person logged into online banking in the past month or it could

84

00:05:21,150  -->  00:05:26,400
be has the person made a transaction in the past three months.

85

00:05:26,400  -->  00:05:30,780
So it's a time frame and a certain action that you're looking for in that time frame and that way you

86

00:05:30,780  -->  00:05:37,290
classify every person as an active or inactive member and in this case we won't go into detail what

87

00:05:37,290  -->  00:05:38,950
exactly this means.

88

00:05:38,970  -->  00:05:42,780
We were actually just given this variable and that's the beauty of logistic regression you can throw

89

00:05:42,780  -->  00:05:43,340
it in.

90

00:05:43,530  -->  00:05:49,050
You can see if it actually affects your logistic regression then you can when you're reporting then

91

00:05:49,050  -->  00:05:54,510
you can dive deeper into what exactly it means and maybe you should adjust the definition so put it

92

00:05:54,510  -->  00:06:03,150
in estimated salary based on the person's balance and age perhaps maybe industry they work in the bank

93

00:06:03,150  -->  00:06:07,440
is able to estimate the salary of the person and provide us this information.

94

00:06:07,440  -->  00:06:11,710
So let's put that in has the person is it or not that's a dependent variable.

95

00:06:11,910  -->  00:06:13,190
So we're not going to touch that.

96

00:06:13,290  -->  00:06:16,020
Now in terms of gender we have to select a baseline.

97

00:06:16,200  -->  00:06:19,860
So the variable that we don't include in here will be the baseline.

98

00:06:19,980  -->  00:06:28,800
And I suggest we select male as a baseline and see and see just insert the female dummy variable into

99

00:06:28,800  -->  00:06:29,820
the regressors.

100

00:06:29,970  -->  00:06:38,280
That way whenever female is 0 it's implied that it's male persons male if the verbal female is one.

101

00:06:38,280  -->  00:06:44,730
That means that the person is female and four countries will select France as a baseline and will put

102

00:06:44,730  -->  00:06:47,010
the other two into the regressors.

103

00:06:47,010  -->  00:06:52,120
So you are welcome and free to choose your baseline here with dummy variables.

104

00:06:52,140  -->  00:06:58,140
However if you want to see exactly the same values and the same coefficients as you will see in this

105

00:06:58,140  -->  00:07:03,320
video then I suggest that you select the same baseline sose put female Spain and Germany into regressors

106

00:07:03,660  -->  00:07:05,150
and leave out male and France.

107

00:07:05,490  -->  00:07:11,690
Once again whatever you choose won't affect the ultimate final result so you're scoring and how you

108

00:07:11,700  -->  00:07:13,010
know the model works and so on.

109

00:07:13,010  -->  00:07:19,860
This is just dummy variables but for the sake of training you could you could copy what I'm doing.

110

00:07:19,890  -->  00:07:27,360
So I'm going to put a show p values here because we don't want slopes of Minu on p values and I'll click

111

00:07:27,420  -->  00:07:28,330
OK.

112

00:07:28,680  -->  00:07:31,030
Whoa that was nerve racking wasn't it.

113

00:07:31,060  -->  00:07:39,460
Our very first Joujou a graphic first iteration of our very first demographic segmentation model.

114

00:07:39,480  -->  00:07:44,990
So here we've got all of variables are independent variables are p values.

115

00:07:45,000  -->  00:07:50,130
We've got some stats on the morals some confusion matrix.

116

00:07:50,130  -->  00:07:51,900
So this is all exciting.

117

00:07:51,900  -->  00:07:59,400
We've got a lot of variables here and we won't go through the coefficients right now because we still

118

00:07:59,400  -->  00:08:05,010
have to build them all right now they don't mean much because some of these variables will be eliminated

119

00:08:05,040  -->  00:08:12,630
through our backward elimination process and we will commence the backward elimination in the next tutorial

120

00:08:12,640  -->  00:08:12,700
.

121

00:08:12,750  -->  00:08:19,200
I will show you exactly step by step how to do everything and how to track your changes there's going

122

00:08:19,200  -->  00:08:20,520
to be lots of steps.

123

00:08:20,520  -->  00:08:22,030
This is the real deal.

124

00:08:22,080  -->  00:08:23,530
We're building this thing.

125

00:08:23,580  -->  00:08:24,840
I look forward to seeing you next time
