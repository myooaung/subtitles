00:00:01,170  -->  00:00:06,410
Before we dive into the section I wanted to give you a quick heads up that there's a caveat around everything

2

00:00:06,410  -->  00:00:13,120
that we're doing with linear regressions linear regressions have assumptions and the assumptions I list

3

00:00:13,120  -->  00:00:20,050
below linearity homeless kids a city multivariate normality independence of errors and lack of multicollinearity

4

00:00:20,700  -->  00:00:26,180
and before building a linear regression model you need to check that these assumptions are true.

5

00:00:26,430  -->  00:00:30,770
And then you can only proceed and be sure that you're building a good linear regression model.

6

00:00:30,780  -->  00:00:35,840
Well in this section we won't be focusing on that we won't be checking these assumptions at all.

7

00:00:35,880  -->  00:00:39,030
And the reason for that is that we have a different goal in mind.

8

00:00:39,030  -->  00:00:44,790
Linear Regression is not our end game linear regression is just a stepping stone for us to get used

9

00:00:44,790  -->  00:00:50,190
to regressions and get comfortable with them and then proceed on to the main part of our modeling section

10

00:00:50,550  -->  00:00:54,070
which is Geo demographic segmentation.

11

00:00:54,240  -->  00:01:00,240
We want to build demographic segmentation model and for that we will actually need a logistical regression

12

00:01:00,750  -->  00:01:07,860
and logistic regression have different assumptions around them and therefore we won't be focusing on

13

00:01:08,030  -->  00:01:09,780
the assumptions of linear regressions.

14

00:01:09,780  -->  00:01:16,920
In this section of the course but if you ever do need to build a linear regression then make sure that

15

00:01:16,920  -->  00:01:22,920
you don't just blindly follow the steps that I present to you in this section of the course but you

16

00:01:22,920  -->  00:01:27,180
do need to go back to the assumptions of the linear regression and research them and make sure that

17

00:01:27,180  -->  00:01:30,210
they are correct when you're building your linear regression.

18

00:01:30,210  -->  00:01:35,300
However having said that I want to point out that from my personal experience logistic regression is

19

00:01:35,310  -->  00:01:36,240
hands down.

20

00:01:36,330  -->  00:01:40,750
By far the most frequently used type of regression in data science.

21

00:01:40,890  -->  00:01:45,540
So what you will learn in this part of the Course will definitely give you the maximum benefit for your

22

00:01:45,540  -->  00:01:46,950
data science career.
