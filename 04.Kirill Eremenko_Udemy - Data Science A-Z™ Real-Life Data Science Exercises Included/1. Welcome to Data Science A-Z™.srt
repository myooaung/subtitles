00:00:00,840  -->  00:00:04,580
Hello welcome to the course on Dollar Signs.

2

00:00:04,590  -->  00:00:06,720
I'm super excited to have you here.

3

00:00:06,810  -->  00:00:09,080
And we're going to have a fantastic journey together.

4

00:00:09,090  -->  00:00:14,880
We're going to dive into four separate rounds of dollar signs and each one will feel like the convention

5

00:00:14,890  -->  00:00:15,200
.

6

00:00:15,420  -->  00:00:19,740
And in this quick tutorial I just wanted to introduce myself quickly and give you an outline of the

7

00:00:19,740  -->  00:00:20,370
course.

8

00:00:20,550  -->  00:00:25,260
So my name is Tor Maiko and I have been in this field for about five years.

9

00:00:25,320  -->  00:00:32,250
I have worked for companies as a scientist and for consulting as a scientist I worked at a stranger

10

00:00:32,640  -->  00:00:38,370
and I had exposure to many different industries and developed lots of skills and experiences which I

11

00:00:38,370  -->  00:00:43,010
wanted to share with you in this course and moving onto the course outline.

12

00:00:43,010  -->  00:00:47,370
I'm just going to jump behind my computer and I'll walk you through the different sections of the course

13

00:00:47,560  -->  00:00:50,130
so that you know how to navigate there.

14

00:00:50,400  -->  00:00:54,740
All right back behind the computer and here I've got the course as we see it.

15

00:00:54,840  -->  00:00:58,300
So I'm going to zoom in a little bit so we can see everything a bit better.

16

00:00:58,530  -->  00:01:02,150
And at the top here we've got the get excited section that's where we are right now.

17

00:01:02,220  -->  00:01:08,400
Then we have that what is data science section which is a bit of an extended introduction into data

18

00:01:08,400  -->  00:01:13,310
science and it tells you about the different areas or domains of data science.

19

00:01:13,350  -->  00:01:19,110
Why data science is going to just grow in demand and is going to be a very popular profession in the

20

00:01:19,110  -->  00:01:22,800
future and why you want to be on this wave early.

21

00:01:22,950  -->  00:01:26,670
And also there's an important story here which is called course pathways.

22

00:01:26,670  -->  00:01:31,730
Now this tutorial is important because it will allow you to create your own learning experience based

23

00:01:31,750  -->  00:01:34,850
of the sections in this course.

24

00:01:34,900  -->  00:01:37,270
And let me explain in a bit more detail what I mean here.

25

00:01:37,410  -->  00:01:44,040
So here we've got Section 3 part one installation there is four parts to the course and they are quite

26

00:01:44,040  -->  00:01:48,390
substantial So they have lots and lots of lectures and you might want to go through them in the order

27

00:01:48,390  -->  00:01:53,550
that they laid out or you might want to combine them into your own learning experience based on what

28

00:01:53,610  -->  00:01:57,430
you are after in terms of learning data science.

29

00:01:57,570  -->  00:01:59,890
So here we've got Tablo eras.

30

00:01:59,940  -->  00:02:05,550
We're using Tablo because it allows us to do visual data mining a very interesting topic which we cover

31

00:02:05,550  -->  00:02:06,370
off.

32

00:02:06,750  -->  00:02:12,840
Then we get an introduction here this introduction to Tablo then I explain how to use Tablo for data

33

00:02:12,840  -->  00:02:13,770
mining.

34

00:02:13,860  -->  00:02:18,840
Then I will show you how to do advanced data mining in Tablo we actually talk about statistical significance

35

00:02:18,840  -->  00:02:22,710
of your data mining based on chi square tests.

36

00:02:22,710  -->  00:02:27,330
Then Part two is modeling so we won't go through all the sections right now but because there's just

37

00:02:27,330  -->  00:02:32,910
a lot of them but basically we refresh our stats in this section and then we learn how to build model

38

00:02:32,910  -->  00:02:33,570
step by step.

39

00:02:33,570  -->  00:02:39,070
So we go through simple linear regression multiple linear regression logistic regression building a

40

00:02:39,070  -->  00:02:45,150
robust demographic segmentation model then we'll learn how to assess the model then we learn how to

41

00:02:45,150  -->  00:02:47,440
draw insights from your model.

42

00:02:47,520  -->  00:02:49,830
We will learn about model maintenance.

43

00:02:49,950  -->  00:02:56,240
We will learn modeling tips and tricks and then we will move on to data preparation.

44

00:02:56,240  -->  00:03:03,330
So this is part three and here this is also a very big part here we're going to learn what business

45

00:03:03,330  -->  00:03:08,790
intelligence tools are and we'll set up all the software for this part of the course then we will talk

46

00:03:08,790  -->  00:03:11,190
about data wrangling before the load.

47

00:03:11,250  -->  00:03:16,750
We'll talk about how to use Sosias for uploading your daughter.

48

00:03:16,860  -->  00:03:20,020
Then we will talk about how to handle errors.

49

00:03:20,460  -->  00:03:24,050
And this is going to add some real Listen to what we're doing.

50

00:03:24,050  -->  00:03:28,910
So there'll be very realistic errors that you will find in real life scenarios.

51

00:03:29,090  -->  00:03:35,580
And here we will learn how to program in school for our science so some basics of skill programming

52

00:03:35,580  -->  00:03:37,690
which we'll need in further sections.

53

00:03:37,690  -->  00:03:43,450
Then we will learn how to perform data wrangling after we have loaded data into a database.

54

00:03:43,770  -->  00:03:49,590
Then we will learn how to handle errors during the last phase of our extractions from load process and

55

00:03:49,590  -->  00:03:53,390
there will be also another very realistic daughter said here.

56

00:03:53,430  -->  00:03:56,070
So you will learn everything about cleaning data.

57

00:03:56,280  -->  00:03:57,920
And finally part for communication.

58

00:03:57,930  -->  00:04:04,050
So this is the part where we talk about how to work with people in the section we talk about how to

59

00:04:04,050  -->  00:04:08,470
work with people and extract information from them to using your data science projects.

60

00:04:08,520  -->  00:04:12,600
And in this section we learn how to present data science projects.

61

00:04:12,750  -->  00:04:16,590
And I actually give you some case studies of my own presentations.

62

00:04:16,740  -->  00:04:20,610
And finally at the end we've got some homework solutions because there will be homework throughout the

63

00:04:20,610  -->  00:04:21,600
course.

64

00:04:21,600  -->  00:04:24,280
So that's how this course works.

65

00:04:24,330  -->  00:04:29,940
Make sure that you check out that tutorial that I mentioned on creating your own pathway because it

66

00:04:29,940  -->  00:04:36,090
will also help you understand how you can structure these sections to gain the maximum benefit in your

67

00:04:36,090  -->  00:04:37,060
specific situation.

68

00:04:37,200  -->  00:04:40,790
And I look forward to seeing inside the course and until next I'm happy analyzing
