00:00:00.720  -->  00:00:06.690
Hope you enjoyed the previous tutorial on assessing your cap curve and today's from us that we're going

2

00:00:06.690  -->  00:00:12.150
to go through the capture of template which I have prepared for you and I've already downloaded the

3

00:00:12.150  -->  00:00:14.570
templates you can get it in the course materials.

4

00:00:14.640  -->  00:00:15.900
I'm going to my desktop here.

5

00:00:16.020  -->  00:00:19.650
And in fact I'm actually going to copy it into my project folder.

6

00:00:20.010  -->  00:00:22.750
There it is copy.

7

00:00:22.770  -->  00:00:23.460
There we go.

8

00:00:23.670  -->  00:00:29.910
And so now I'm going to get excel and open up the cap curve template and I'll walk you through it.

9

00:00:29.970  -->  00:00:31.760
So it is on zoomed in.

10

00:00:31.830  -->  00:00:35.670
Normally it's like like this this size.

11

00:00:35.710  -->  00:00:37.540
So this is zoomed in.

12

00:00:38.040  -->  00:00:42.660
And here you can see your confusion matrix which will be populated as soon as you're copying the data

13

00:00:42.660  -->  00:00:48.190
which is always nice to have like a nice bonus for you over there.

14

00:00:48.360  -->  00:00:50.760
But mainly the cap cover is over here.

15

00:00:50.760  -->  00:00:56.370
This is the main working area for the cap curve and going from the top you can see right away.

16

00:00:56.370  -->  00:00:57.550
Total number of exited.

17

00:00:57.570  -->  00:01:02.760
That's the total number of successes that you're going to have in this column in column B Colombe so

18

00:01:02.760  -->  00:01:11.910
from here downwards then success I mean of course like ones in your binary outcome for the dependent

19

00:01:11.970  -->  00:01:18.750
variable then a total requisite total number of rows are going to have in your data preset exited is

20

00:01:18.900  -->  00:01:25.860
the rate at which there exists a 1 divided by the other row number is basically just required so that

21

00:01:25.860  -->  00:01:28.350
you have a row numbering here then exited.

22

00:01:28.350  -->  00:01:33.200
Is your binary outcome so your actual what was actually observed.

23

00:01:33.850  -->  00:01:38.070
And that is what your model predicted.

24

00:01:38.070  -->  00:01:43.590
So your the probability that the model predicts for that specific row number to exit and that's where

25

00:01:43.590  -->  00:01:45.170
the row numbers in there.

26

00:01:45.600  -->  00:01:48.970
And then you've got the grey blue and pink as we discussed previously.

27

00:01:49.020  -->  00:01:52.800
So what you need to do and we'll do this in a second what we're you will need to do is you need to copy

28

00:01:52.800  -->  00:01:55.260
your daughter here and has to be ordered so you see this

29

00:01:57.810  -->  00:02:03.090
instruction here and that means that you have to order your daughter by the hat first in descending

30

00:02:03.090  -->  00:02:07.320
order so the most probable people to exit should be at the top which makes sense right.

31

00:02:07.320  -->  00:02:12.870
So you're going to if you're going to contact them you're going to contact the most likely ones to perform

32

00:02:12.870  -->  00:02:21.060
the action first and then after you've copied your daughter in order in its ordered form then you will

33

00:02:21.060  -->  00:02:27.630
need to populate this bit so you'll have to delete this row and then just drag this cell downwards.

34

00:02:27.870  -->  00:02:29.450
Just this one row.

35

00:02:29.460  -->  00:02:34.640
This these six cells you just drag them downwards to match the number of rows you have here.

36

00:02:34.650  -->  00:02:37.310
So let's go ahead and do all of that.

37

00:02:37.710  -->  00:02:45.570
Whereas our project folder and now we are going to look for chern modeling forecasts so that data set

38

00:02:45.570  -->  00:02:51.670
that we prepared previously I'm going bring up another excel and I'm going to drag churn morning for

39

00:02:51.710  -->  00:02:51.920
.

40

00:02:52.000  -->  00:02:57.400
Boy here's a quick tip for you if you want to bring up another excel like I did here.

41

00:02:57.580  -->  00:03:01.200
Somebody quite a few people have asked me this actually.

42

00:03:01.350  -->  00:03:09.300
Very easy on your Start Menu which I don't have brought up because it's on my other screen.

43

00:03:09.300  -->  00:03:11.620
All you have to do is you know how you click excel there.

44

00:03:11.880  -->  00:03:16.400
You left click to bring up a program in that in the toolbar.

45

00:03:16.730  -->  00:03:18.420
It's the taskbar in the taskbar.

46

00:03:18.600  -->  00:03:23.970
Well just instead of left clicking it click it with your middle mouse button so click it if you will

47

00:03:23.970  -->  00:03:28.790
and like I can bring another one and there's another one I'm just doing I'm just clicking it off and

48

00:03:28.810  -->  00:03:35.760
then the middle mouse button and save instead of going through file open a new excel and something like

49

00:03:35.760  -->  00:03:38.210
this you can just bring up as many of them as you want.

50

00:03:38.520  -->  00:03:40.340
And you know maybe that'll help you out.

51

00:03:40.350  -->  00:03:45.900
Maybe there will be a handy trick you'll use someday otherwise you know all of your tabs all of your

52

00:03:45.900  -->  00:03:49.780
worksheets are in one excel and you can freely move them around like this.

53

00:03:49.920  -->  00:03:51.540
I find this is sometimes handy.

54

00:03:51.760  -->  00:03:55.580
Anyway back to our research or analysis.

55

00:03:55.830  -->  00:04:02.600
I'm going to zoom in here and I'm going to select all of this and I'll do it.

56

00:04:03.150  -->  00:04:05.430
I'll I'll put in a filter like this this time.

57

00:04:05.550  -->  00:04:08.280
So we'll order largest to smallest.

58

00:04:08.280  -->  00:04:09.330
There we go.

59

00:04:09.330  -->  00:04:12.580
So remember you don't need to copy the top religiously each copy.

60

00:04:12.610  -->  00:04:15.640
You don't need to copy the header you just copy all the data.

61

00:04:15.670  -->  00:04:20.600
There you go copy and paste it in here.

62

00:04:20.590  -->  00:04:21.650
Voila there it is.

63

00:04:21.930  -->  00:04:22.800
Is in there.

64

00:04:22.800  -->  00:04:28.110
Now one thing you should keep in mind I'm going to expand this by the way.

65

00:04:28.120  -->  00:04:31.500
Here's our.

66

00:04:31.650  -->  00:04:35.520
Here is our confusion matrix.

67

00:04:35.520  -->  00:04:37.650
It's a working totally fine.

68

00:04:37.650  -->  00:04:39.630
So that's that's good.

69

00:04:39.630  -->  00:04:40.320
That's exciting.

70

00:04:40.320  -->  00:04:45.750
You can see that the total in here is ten thousand a record so easy here 10000 You can always just do

71

00:04:45.750  -->  00:04:46.990
that check.

72

00:04:47.250  -->  00:04:51.420
And the other thing I wanted to mention was look in these formulas you can see that I've put them up

73

00:04:51.420  -->  00:04:52.350
to a million.

74

00:04:52.470  -->  00:04:57.060
So they go this far and it goes from here all the way down to a million.

75

00:04:57.090  -->  00:04:59.910
This formula goes from there all the way down to million.

76

00:04:59.940  -->  00:05:04.310
So just to make sure if you have a more than a million records in your data set.

77

00:05:04.560  -->  00:05:06.770
Well first of all probably excel won't fit them.

78

00:05:06.900  -->  00:05:13.200
But anyway just make sure that you're not exceeding this limit if you are you might have to adjust this

79

00:05:13.200  -->  00:05:15.950
formula otherwise everything looks good.

80

00:05:15.990  -->  00:05:18.560
We've copied our data and now we're going to do this part.

81

00:05:18.600  -->  00:05:25.320
So I'm going to just delete this text and you can just go ahead and drag on like that or the fastest

82

00:05:25.320  -->  00:05:32.400
way is just double click this little square and they get dragged all the way down to like I'm going

83

00:05:32.400  -->  00:05:33.400
to press control down.

84

00:05:33.420  -->  00:05:34.460
And here you can see that.

85

00:05:34.470  -->  00:05:36.170
Exactly how much we need.

86

00:05:36.630  -->  00:05:37.830
Ok everything looks good.

87

00:05:37.830  -->  00:05:44.850
All you have to do now is the last bid just select through control hold down control so e g and i insert

88

00:05:45.100  -->  00:05:46.630
line this line.

89

00:05:46.720  -->  00:05:47.530
Bam.

90

00:05:47.790  -->  00:05:49.230
Get rid of the legend.

91

00:05:49.320  -->  00:05:50.520
All done.

92

00:05:50.580  -->  00:05:55.810
That's how you use the cap curve template as you can see it's the same result as we had previously.

93

00:05:55.810  -->  00:05:57.960
If you want to insert a shape just go ahead.

94

00:05:57.960  -->  00:06:00.940
Hold down shift and there will be a vertical line.

95

00:06:01.090  -->  00:06:01.500
There you go.

96

00:06:01.500  -->  00:06:03.280
So that's eight and a half percent.

97

00:06:03.360  -->  00:06:05.040
That's how you use the cap curve template.

98

00:06:05.040  -->  00:06:11.690
It's all yours to take away and use in your own work.

99

00:06:11.940  -->  00:06:12.900
That's it.

100

00:06:12.900  -->  00:06:14.510
Have fun and enjoy.

101

00:06:14.520  -->  00:06:17.270
And I will see you in the next tutorial.

102

00:06:17.280  -->  00:06:19.590
Until next time happy analyzing
