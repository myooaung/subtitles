00:00:00,870  -->  00:00:06,420
Joe's demographics segmentation What is it and what is it used for.

2

00:00:06,420  -->  00:00:07,710
Let's imagine a scenario.

3

00:00:07,920  -->  00:00:14,070
You're a data scientist working at a bank and this bank has lots and lots of customers and at some point

4

00:00:14,070  -->  00:00:16,010
you decide to take a random sample.

5

00:00:16,020  -->  00:00:22,980
All these customers and take a snapshot in that point in time meaning that you gather all the information

6

00:00:22,980  -->  00:00:24,210
you can on these customers.

7

00:00:24,270  -->  00:00:30,870
And we're talking about things like age gender how many products they have with your bank whether or

8

00:00:30,870  -->  00:00:32,070
not they have a credit card.

9

00:00:32,070  -->  00:00:35,900
How long they've been with your bank and things like that.

10

00:00:35,910  -->  00:00:41,760
So as much information as you can and you attach it to their records.

11

00:00:41,760  -->  00:00:44,640
In this case for simplicity we're going to track two things.

12

00:00:44,640  -->  00:00:46,830
The first thing is gender as you can see here.

13

00:00:47,010  -->  00:00:51,810
And the second thing is their favorite color now tracking the favorite color of a customer a bank might

14

00:00:51,810  -->  00:00:53,400
not add a lot of value.

15

00:00:53,430  -->  00:00:58,550
However this is just a representation for something for any other variable.

16

00:00:58,560  -->  00:01:01,770
It's just for simplicity sake in this specific example.

17

00:01:02,430  -->  00:01:07,700
And then what you do is you track these customers for the next six months and six months on the track

18

00:01:07,710  -->  00:01:07,740
.

19

00:01:07,740  -->  00:01:12,090
You look back and assess which of these customers left your bank and which of these customers stayed

20

00:01:12,090  -->  00:01:12,900
.

21

00:01:12,900  -->  00:01:19,260
So my question to you here is do you think that this information would be helpful to you that you now

22

00:01:19,260  -->  00:01:25,470
know that out of a sample which is quite a large sample let's say 10000 customers out of that sample

23

00:01:25,530  -->  00:01:28,460
every single female whose favorite color is red.

24

00:01:28,590  -->  00:01:30,530
Left your bank and everything.

25

00:01:30,540  -->  00:01:37,140
And two thirds of the males whose favorite colors purple left bank and one third of the females whose

26

00:01:37,140  -->  00:01:39,370
favorite color is green left her back.

27

00:01:39,420  -->  00:01:45,270
So do you think that she could somehow apply this information in the foreseeable future to prevent other

28

00:01:45,270  -->  00:01:50,550
customers from leaving the bank or as they call it churning from your bank.

29

00:01:50,550  -->  00:01:56,130
And that is exactly what Joe demographic segmentation is what you would do going forward is you would

30

00:01:56,130  -->  00:02:00,670
take another sample of your customers or even perhaps all of your customers.

31

00:02:00,900  -->  00:02:05,430
And the first thing you would do is you would find out their gender which you know and their favorite

32

00:02:05,430  -->  00:02:06,400
color.

33

00:02:06,480  -->  00:02:11,940
Once you found out their favorite color based on your prior experience you can group them or segment

34

00:02:11,940  -->  00:02:13,090
them.

35

00:02:13,620  -->  00:02:15,450
And this is how you would segment them.

36

00:02:15,480  -->  00:02:19,920
The first group on the right here is the group at highest risk of churning.

37

00:02:19,920  -->  00:02:21,970
So these are females with the color red.

38

00:02:22,050  -->  00:02:26,120
Based on what you know within six months they're probably all going to be gone.

39

00:02:26,250  -->  00:02:30,530
Then the next group is the males whose hair color purple.

40

00:02:30,690  -->  00:02:36,480
Also based on your experiment probably 60 percent of them will be gone within six months.

41

00:02:36,660  -->  00:02:40,100
And then it's the females with their favorite color green.

42

00:02:40,140  -->  00:02:44,550
30 percent of whom might be out of your bank in six months.

43

00:02:44,550  -->  00:02:47,760
Then you've got a group over here who are kind of in between.

44

00:02:47,760  -->  00:02:52,650
So their favorite colors match those that leave but then their genders don't.

45

00:02:52,650  -->  00:02:59,460
So they might be addressed and might not you would give them a probability of living so a certain chance

46

00:02:59,460  -->  00:03:05,040
a likelihood that they will leave and then you've got the orange and the blue who are definitely your

47

00:03:05,040  -->  00:03:07,990
loyal customers and who are not going anywhere.

48

00:03:08,330  -->  00:03:15,720
And so this knowledge and information will allow you to further preempt any kind of churn that might

49

00:03:15,720  -->  00:03:24,120
occur and perhaps talk to these customers or give them a special offers or just something that will

50

00:03:24,570  -->  00:03:25,880
prevent them from leaving.

51

00:03:25,880  -->  00:03:32,070
So be really proactive in your approach and this is what's called Geo demographic segmentation because

52

00:03:32,820  -->  00:03:39,750
you are taking into account factors like where these people live in what country or what region or what

53

00:03:39,750  -->  00:03:40,720
postcode.

54

00:03:40,870  -->  00:03:43,730
Then you take into account the demographics data.

55

00:03:43,740  -->  00:03:50,850
So how affluent they are or what their income is how much they bank with you how many children they

56

00:03:50,850  -->  00:03:55,520
have whether they're married or not whether their spouses have accounts with you as well.

57

00:03:55,530  -->  00:04:03,840
So you don't know the future but based on certain similarities of these customers that you're investigating

58

00:04:03,840  -->  00:04:06,620
right now to the customers that actually left.

59

00:04:06,620  -->  00:04:15,180
You can put the new customers or the existing customers into groups and assess the likelihood of leaving

60

00:04:15,180  -->  00:04:15,560
.

61

00:04:15,810  -->  00:04:20,320
And this is what we're going to be doing in this section all in this section in the next section and

62

00:04:20,320  -->  00:04:21,780
the section after that.

63

00:04:21,780  -->  00:04:29,850
We're going to be creating a robust Joe demographic segmentation model using logistic regression because

64

00:04:29,850  -->  00:04:33,100
this is one this is a zero in one situation right.

65

00:04:33,120  -->  00:04:36,210
Yes No Did the person leave or did the person stay.

66

00:04:36,510  -->  00:04:38,960
And so finally we're going to put everything together.

67

00:04:38,970  -->  00:04:45,930
We're going to use logistic regression to create this incredible job demographic segmentation model

68

00:04:46,080  -->  00:04:52,470
that will allow us to draw conclusions and predictions on who is most likely to leave our bank and who

69

00:04:52,470  -->  00:04:58,610
is most likely to stay and then will be able to draw insights and give recommendations.

70

00:04:58,620  -->  00:05:01,250
So that's how Joe demographic segmentation works.

71

00:05:01,380  -->  00:05:04,410
And in the next tutorial we're going to start building this model
