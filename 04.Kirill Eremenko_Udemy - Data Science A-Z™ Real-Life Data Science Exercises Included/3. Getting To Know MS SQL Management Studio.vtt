00:00:01.920  -->  00:00:08.580
We've already used a skill Server Management Studio quite a lot in the previous tutorials and today

2

00:00:08.610  -->  00:00:16.100
I just wanted to do a quick formal introduction to this tool so that we get that out of the way.

3

00:00:16.170  -->  00:00:23.430
Really there isn't much to mention here just that this is a skill or a management studio on the left

4

00:00:23.430  -->  00:00:29.580
who got the object Explorer which we've already dabbled with a little bit and you have your database

5

00:00:29.580  -->  00:00:35.910
that you're connected to over here at the top the only button that will be using and in this view is

6

00:00:35.910  -->  00:00:40.700
the new query button and it brings up a query where we can create code.

7

00:00:41.040  -->  00:00:44.070
Then once our code is created will be using exit queued button.

8

00:00:44.100  -->  00:00:47.820
So not the debug button but the execute button to run code.

9

00:00:47.820  -->  00:00:52.820
It's the same as pressing a 5 or control on the keyboard.

10

00:00:52.890  -->  00:01:00.180
And also here you have the database that you're in sometimes will be set to Mostel sometimes will be

11

00:01:00.180  -->  00:01:02.160
set to Diest training.

12

00:01:02.160  -->  00:01:08.990
So we will be talking about how to avoid having to change it all the time.

13

00:01:08.990  -->  00:01:11.090
Further in this course.

14

00:01:11.280  -->  00:01:13.860
And finally what are you doing here.

15

00:01:13.870  -->  00:01:15.030
Is it because it's a blank space.

16

00:01:15.030  -->  00:01:15.940
Will you give.

17

00:01:16.410  -->  00:01:19.710
You make queries you write queries and you give commands to us.

18

00:01:19.710  -->  00:01:26.150
Q Well on what you wanted to do what data you wanted to bring up and show you or what you wanted taught

19

00:01:26.420  -->  00:01:33.030
how you wanted to manipulate the data and create Joines and convert data types and create tables and

20

00:01:33.030  -->  00:01:33.270
so on.

21

00:01:33.270  -->  00:01:38.430
So it's like a blank space where you write up code and then you execute it.

22

00:01:38.460  -->  00:01:41.370
The only issue is that you can save this code.

23

00:01:41.400  -->  00:01:46.630
You can press convalesce and save it on your hard drive but nobody actually does that.

24

00:01:46.650  -->  00:01:51.630
I will show you a much better method in the next section of the course when we're talking about stored

25

00:01:51.630  -->  00:01:58.920
procedures how to save your code because for us as a scientist it's important to save our work so that

26

00:01:58.920  -->  00:02:04.130
we can later modify it repeat it or get somebody to queue it.

27

00:02:04.320  -->  00:02:08.570
And that's pretty much it as full service management shoot is very simple.

28

00:02:08.580  -->  00:02:12.020
And I'm sure you will get along just fine.

29

00:02:12.030  -->  00:02:13.410
As we've progressed the section
