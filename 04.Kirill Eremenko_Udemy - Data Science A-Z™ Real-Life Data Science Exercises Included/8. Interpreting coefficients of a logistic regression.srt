00:00:00,960  -->  00:00:07,230
Hello and welcome back in today's tutorial we will look at the coefficients of a logistic regression

2

00:00:07,320  -->  00:00:12,430
and we will understand what insights we can and what it says we cannot derive from our models.

3

00:00:12,780  -->  00:00:15,680
So let's go ahead and create our model as you can see.

4

00:00:15,690  -->  00:00:21,710
I've already loaded the data it's the email offer we file and I have created dummy variables.

5

00:00:21,710  -->  00:00:28,530
Now I'm going to go to model limited logic binary and the depende variables took action.

6

00:00:28,560  -->  00:00:31,930
I'll set it as default regressors.

7

00:00:31,950  -->  00:00:37,650
I'm going to use H and female the dummy variable for female and Auel click show p values.

8

00:00:37,710  -->  00:00:42,630
So once you've done that click OK and here is our model.

9

00:00:42,660  -->  00:00:48,660
So what we are focusing on today is this top part and there are four main points that I wanted to get

10

00:00:48,660  -->  00:00:54,360
across today and the last will be a bit complex but I'll get to that.

11

00:00:54,360  -->  00:01:01,110
So to start off with the first thing that you can do just in like in a linear regression you can look

12

00:01:01,110  -->  00:01:01,890
at the sign.

13

00:01:02,010  -->  00:01:04,280
So the sign here for female is negative.

14

00:01:04,470  -->  00:01:06,230
The sign for age is positive.

15

00:01:06,280  -->  00:01:08,950
That means that female detracts from the effect.

16

00:01:09,060  -->  00:01:11,010
Age adds to the effect.

17

00:01:11,520  -->  00:01:12,300
What does that mean.

18

00:01:12,300  -->  00:01:18,780
That means that if you take everything hold everything else constant but you increase age by one year

19

00:01:19,290  -->  00:01:25,800
then the probability will increase and the same thing if you take two people the same age and one of

20

00:01:25,800  -->  00:01:26,370
them is male.

21

00:01:26,370  -->  00:01:32,960
Another one is female then the probability for female will be lower the probability predicted by this

22

00:01:32,960  -->  00:01:34,740
model be lower.

23

00:01:34,740  -->  00:01:37,140
Now that is the first thing that you can do.

24

00:01:37,140  -->  00:01:44,970
The second thing is something you cannot do and you cannot use the coefficients to quantify any interpretations

25

00:01:44,970  -->  00:01:46,290
.

26

00:01:46,290  -->  00:01:52,050
Remember how in that linear regression we were able to say because 1 coefficient is greater than the

27

00:01:52,050  -->  00:01:52,600
other.

28

00:01:52,710  -->  00:01:59,940
Then we can understand how much greater the effect of that variable is compared to the effect of the

29

00:01:59,940  -->  00:02:00,510
other one.

30

00:02:00,690  -->  00:02:05,490
So in order to understand this a bit better I'm going to run a new model.

31

00:02:05,490  -->  00:02:06,930
I'll leave this to the side.

32

00:02:07,040  -->  00:02:14,770
We're going to run a new model but I'm going to replace female biner the dummy variable for FEMA replace

33

00:02:14,790  -->  00:02:17,410
it with mail and I'll run it now.

34

00:02:17,760  -->  00:02:21,370
So here you can see that both coefficients are positive.

35

00:02:21,390  -->  00:02:28,830
However what we could have done in a linear regression we could have said that because the coefficient

36

00:02:28,830  -->  00:02:33,250
for mail is five times greater than the coefficient for H.

37

00:02:33,300  -->  00:02:41,310
That means that the effect of this variable as you remember we used to say per unit of of that variable

38

00:02:41,310  -->  00:02:46,450
is greater than the per unit effect of the H variable.

39

00:02:46,470  -->  00:02:53,790
However in a logistic regression you cannot use the coefficients to quantify any sort of effect.

40

00:02:54,030  -->  00:02:59,310
So let's go to the logistic regression formula to understand this.

41

00:02:59,310  -->  00:03:02,730
This is a former for the simple logistic regression.

42

00:03:03,090  -->  00:03:07,830
This is a form of for the multiple The logistic regression and it's also called the logistic regression

43

00:03:08,100  -->  00:03:12,920
just because people don't normally use the simple logistic regression.

44

00:03:12,960  -->  00:03:20,880
In fact the whole share of seegar if you very very often the number of variables in a logistic regression

45

00:03:20,970  -->  00:03:26,790
is can be very high so 5:06 is standard 10 20 is also very normal.

46

00:03:26,790  -->  00:03:29,910
Can go up to huge numbers.

47

00:03:29,910  -->  00:03:35,220
Not saying that that is the best approach to use logistic regression but you will come across situations

48

00:03:35,220  -->  00:03:39,440
when there's lots and lots of variables in a logistic regression.

49

00:03:39,750  -->  00:03:45,600
So what else you can see from here is that the verbal that we're predicting P is actually hidden.

50

00:03:45,600  -->  00:03:51,720
It's not just on the left of the equals on it's inside a ratio which is called The Odds Ratio and it's

51

00:03:51,720  -->  00:03:55,730
inside a logarithm So this whole expression the left is called the log odds.

52

00:03:56,340  -->  00:03:59,910
And people just don't think in log terms.

53

00:04:00,030  -->  00:04:04,190
So this variable or this new expression log odds.

54

00:04:04,290  -->  00:04:07,450
It's not that easy to understand or visualize in your head.

55

00:04:07,500  -->  00:04:14,010
If you look at LOEG odds as a separate variable then this becomes a linear regression for log odds and

56

00:04:14,010  -->  00:04:16,110
that way you could interpret the coefficients.

57

00:04:16,110  -->  00:04:23,430
But if you want to interpret the coefficients for the probability then from here you simply cannot do

58

00:04:23,430  -->  00:04:26,080
that because the formula is so complex.

59

00:04:26,310  -->  00:04:32,760
So we will stop on that that we cannot use the coefficients to quantify any effects and that actually

60

00:04:32,760  -->  00:04:34,540
implies two things.

61

00:04:34,620  -->  00:04:41,850
The first thing is that you cannot use the coefficient to quantify the per unit effect of a variable

62

00:04:41,940  -->  00:04:52,210
or an independent variable to your dependent variable so like we used to say that a $5 increase or one

63

00:04:52,210  -->  00:04:58,800
dollar increase in marketing spend results in a so many dollar increase in revenue you can't do that

64

00:04:58,820  -->  00:04:58,870
.

65

00:04:58,920  -->  00:05:06,750
And the second thing in a second sump part of this is that you cannot use the coefficients to quantify

66

00:05:07,110  -->  00:05:11,020
to compare the quantified effects of the two different Marable's.

67

00:05:11,130  -->  00:05:15,510
So you can't say for coefficient one variable is greater than the other five times greater than the

68

00:05:15,510  -->  00:05:17,760
other than the effects can be five times greater.

69

00:05:17,760  -->  00:05:23,150
Once again is because it's to do with quantification you simply cannot do that because the former Formula

70

00:05:23,150  -->  00:05:24,830
is complex.

71

00:05:24,990  -->  00:05:27,350
So we'll end that part on that.

72

00:05:27,450  -->  00:05:32,970
That is point number two point number three is what you can do which you can do is you can look at the

73

00:05:32,970  -->  00:05:41,310
coefficients and without quantifying the effects you can say you can still observe and you can determine

74

00:05:41,370  -->  00:05:43,740
which effect is greater.

75

00:05:43,740  -->  00:05:50,190
So just generally speaking which effect is greater here you can see that the coefficient for male is

76

00:05:50,190  -->  00:05:52,040
greater than the coefficient for H.

77

00:05:52,770  -->  00:06:01,140
And that means that per unit of this variable it is the effect is greater than per unit of this variable

78

00:06:01,140  -->  00:06:01,290
.

79

00:06:01,290  -->  00:06:06,810
And remember that everything is relative and this is going to be important just now it is relative to

80

00:06:06,810  -->  00:06:13,110
the scale that you are measuring these variables on because we're measuring age in years.

81

00:06:13,110  -->  00:06:21,440
So if we start measuring age in months then the values of age will go up 12 times.

82

00:06:21,450  -->  00:06:26,150
So that means the coefficient and what all cell is same but the coefficient will go down 12 times.

83

00:06:26,340  -->  00:06:33,510
And if we start measuring age in decades then the values of the variable will go down by 10 but the

84

00:06:33,510  -->  00:06:38,850
coefficient will go up by 10 and so we can manipulate the coefficient the absolute value of the confession

85

00:06:39,360  -->  00:06:42,980
and therefore we always have to say per unit.

86

00:06:43,770  -->  00:06:49,890
So you can still do that you can compare per unit and see which of which of the variables has a greater

87

00:06:49,890  -->  00:06:51,520
effect per unit.

88

00:06:51,540  -->  00:06:53,200
So remember is relative.

89

00:06:53,430  -->  00:06:56,820
Now the last thing is a more of an advanced technique.

90

00:06:56,850  -->  00:07:03,930
And for some of you it might not apply so you just ignore it if you don't think that you'll be using

91

00:07:03,930  -->  00:07:04,180
it.

92

00:07:04,320  -->  00:07:09,720
But for those who are more interested in like the advanced type of stats then there is this variable

93

00:07:09,720  -->  00:07:15,530
here Zed score and this score is basically a standardized coefficient and how do you get that score

94

00:07:15,540  -->  00:07:21,560
well you all all that you need to do to get that score is you take your coefficient and you divided

95

00:07:21,570  -->  00:07:24,050
by your standard error of that variable.

96

00:07:24,060  -->  00:07:24,840
Same thing here.

97

00:07:24,870  -->  00:07:26,940
Coefficient divided by the standard error.

98

00:07:27,180  -->  00:07:28,920
And here you get a set score.

99

00:07:28,920  -->  00:07:34,160
So you can think of that score in terms of a standardized coefficient.

100

00:07:34,320  -->  00:07:43,410
And what that means is that it is no longer dependent on the scale of that specific variable so because

101

00:07:43,470  -->  00:07:49,170
the standard error is also measured in years when you divide one by the other you get this coefficient

102

00:07:49,170  -->  00:07:55,440
which won't change if you change the scale on which you're measuring age or same thing with kilometres

103

00:07:55,440  -->  00:08:00,710
in two meters or inches and kilograms into pounds and so on or grams.

104

00:08:00,720  -->  00:08:06,190
So this Zed won't change if you change the scale of the underlying variable.

105

00:08:06,390  -->  00:08:13,590
However it is much more complex to interpret because Zed is measured on its own scale and that scale

106

00:08:13,620  -->  00:08:19,760
is in units of the standard deviation of the underlying variable.

107

00:08:20,200  -->  00:08:23,520
And once again as humans we don't think in those units.

108

00:08:23,520  -->  00:08:30,180
And moreover because it's all relative it can lead to different seemingly different results.

109

00:08:30,180  -->  00:08:35,990
So here you can see that Zed for age is three point eight said for male is two point nine.

110

00:08:36,240  -->  00:08:42,300
Although here we said that the effect of male is greater from based on the xit statistic it looks like

111

00:08:42,300  -->  00:08:43,670
the effect of age is greater.

112

00:08:43,830  -->  00:08:48,840
But it might be confusing if we think of it in absolute terms but it's all relative.

113

00:08:48,840  -->  00:08:55,620
So the effect here was greater for male in terms of relative to the units of each of these variables

114

00:08:55,620  -->  00:08:55,810
.

115

00:08:55,890  -->  00:09:02,730
Here are the effect of age is greater relative to the standard deviation of each variable.

116

00:09:02,940  -->  00:09:08,760
So although there might be more convenient when you have lots of variables in mind the more convenient

117

00:09:08,760  -->  00:09:13,330
because it's standardized and you don't have to remember the different units and always say them.

118

00:09:13,590  -->  00:09:16,770
It might be a bit harder to interpret.

119

00:09:17,280  -->  00:09:22,260
So once again that's a bit more of an advance topic and you can still use your models without having

120

00:09:22,260  -->  00:09:23,820
to worry about that.

121

00:09:23,880  -->  00:09:25,890
Just focus on the coefficient.

122

00:09:25,890  -->  00:09:29,440
Those were the four things that you can and cannot do if logistic regression.

123

00:09:29,550  -->  00:09:33,230
And here's a slide that you can take away after this tutorial.

124

00:09:33,270  -->  00:09:38,850
You can just simply download it and use it for reference in the future so it sums up those four things

125

00:09:38,850  -->  00:09:39,470
.

126

00:09:39,470  -->  00:09:40,410
Now let's quickly recap.

127

00:09:40,410  -->  00:09:46,390
You can interpret signs you cannot interpret magnitudes to quantify associations.

128

00:09:46,530  -->  00:09:55,860
You can still use magnitudes to contrast per unit associations and you can use that statistic to conscience

129

00:09:55,980  -->  00:09:57,420
associations as well.

130

00:09:57,420  -->  00:10:02,280
However the sense that this is standardize so it might be a bit harder to interpret
