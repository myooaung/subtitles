1

00:00:00,480  -->  00:00:00,870
All right.

2

00:00:00,870  -->  00:00:03,590
Welcome to the homework to Tauriel for this section.

3

00:00:03,600  -->  00:00:07,120
It's exciting that you've decided to undertake this challenge.

4

00:00:07,260  -->  00:00:10,130
And let me show you where to get that does it.

5

00:00:10,140  -->  00:00:17,610
So if you go as usual to super size that comsats training and then you scroll down to part 3.0 prep

6

00:00:18,060  -->  00:00:24,510
and then you look at Section 4 handling areas doing it well phases 1 and 2 then your homeward data sets

7

00:00:24,510  -->  00:00:26,050
over here over to our set.

8

00:00:26,070  -->  00:00:28,420
FAKE NAMES UK dot zip.

9

00:00:28,530  -->  00:00:33,510
So if you download that and unzip it then you'll get a file which looks like this.

10

00:00:33,510  -->  00:00:35,460
FAKE NAMES cadency a sweep.

11

00:00:35,490  -->  00:00:41,810
And let's go ahead and open up this file so I can explain what the challenge is for today.

12

00:00:41,910  -->  00:00:43,410
So I'm going to zoom in a bit.

13

00:00:43,410  -->  00:00:47,760
So here you've got a file with some customer records.

14

00:00:48,060  -->  00:00:51,170
And then it's got quite a few columns.

15

00:00:51,170  -->  00:00:57,360
If you scroll down you can see that the number of rows is supposed to be 100000 according to this column

16

00:00:57,370  -->  00:01:01,060
but in reality it's much less not much less but a bit less.

17

00:01:01,080  -->  00:01:07,170
So there was definitely already we can tell something is wrong with the file probably a lot more is

18

00:01:07,170  -->  00:01:08,550
wrong with the file.

19

00:01:09,120  -->  00:01:13,280
And what I wanted to tell you so what is this whole project about.

20

00:01:13,440  -->  00:01:23,340
Well you are Imagine yourself as a data scientist who's performing some research or analysis for a medical

21

00:01:23,340  -->  00:01:31,830
facility and this research is reliant on three factors three main columns that you definitely need for

22

00:01:31,830  -->  00:01:37,260
analysis are the last three Kolbe's blood type kilograms and centimeters.

23

00:01:37,260  -->  00:01:45,060
So basically you're assessing as you can kind of guess from here that you're assessing how the blood

24

00:01:45,060  -->  00:01:47,460
type affects people's BMI.

25

00:01:47,460  -->  00:01:52,360
So body mass index which you can calculate from kilograms and centimeters something.

26

00:01:52,410  -->  00:01:58,560
So there's some combination of these three columns that you will be assessing or that are going to be

27

00:01:58,560  -->  00:01:59,630
assessed in this project.

28

00:01:59,700  -->  00:02:03,370
And right now what you need to do is upload the data into the database.

29

00:02:03,570  -->  00:02:09,450
So because you will be using these two columns that means that they're critical and your role that doesn't

30

00:02:09,450  -->  00:02:15,480
have information in it in any one of these columns is not useful for your analysis can because he's

31

00:02:15,480  -->  00:02:17,490
got a lot of rows 100000.

32

00:02:17,670  -->  00:02:21,780
And according to the instructions you are.

33

00:02:21,780  -->  00:02:27,930
It's like it's a statistical analysis so you're not going to be reporting back to these people or anything

34

00:02:27,930  -->  00:02:28,080
.

35

00:02:28,110  -->  00:02:36,930
It's more to see how how this effect a phenomenon that you're observing how it's actually distributed

36

00:02:36,930  -->  00:02:38,880
across the population and things like that.

37

00:02:38,880  -->  00:02:43,140
So if you exclude a couple of rows not a problem because you are going to be looking at averages and

38

00:02:43,140  -->  00:02:44,540
things like that.

39

00:02:44,550  -->  00:02:49,920
So from here you gather that you have to have these three columns Yeah old all the records that you

40

00:02:49,920  -->  00:02:50,560
can analyze.

41

00:02:50,550  -->  00:02:53,180
They have to have these data in these three columns.

42

00:02:53,250  -->  00:02:55,840
The rest are nice to have but they're not critical.

43

00:02:55,860  -->  00:03:02,540
So that's what you'll be looking for and that has to be included in your T.L. upload part.

44

00:03:02,610  -->  00:03:09,090
So that as this is I guess uploader we're doing through conditional splits you've got to take that into

45

00:03:09,090  -->  00:03:09,570
account there.

46

00:03:09,570  -->  00:03:17,150
Plus you going to remove any corrupted records that will jeopardize your analysis down the track.

47

00:03:17,310  -->  00:03:18,140
So that's that.

48

00:03:18,210  -->  00:03:20,790
I'll leave you with those instructions.

49

00:03:20,790  -->  00:03:23,020
Good luck with this homework.

50

00:03:23,070  -->  00:03:28,980
And don't forget that all the homework solutions for all the exercises and the scores are available

51

00:03:29,070  -->  00:03:30,930
at the very end of the course.

52

00:03:31,020  -->  00:03:31,920
So check that out.

53

00:03:31,950  -->  00:03:33,360
After you finished.

54

00:03:33,360  -->  00:03:36,470
Hope you go well and I look forward to seeing you on the next tutorial.

55

00:03:36,570  -->  00:03:38,280
Until then happy analyzing
