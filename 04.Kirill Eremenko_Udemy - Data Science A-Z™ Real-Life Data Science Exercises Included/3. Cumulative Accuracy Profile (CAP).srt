1

00:00:01,080  -->  00:00:03,900
Improve the toil we talked about the accuracy paradox.

2

00:00:04,180  -->  00:00:11,010
Hopefully now you see why we need more robust methods to assess how models and we talk about the cumulative

3

00:00:11,040  -->  00:00:14,710
accuracy profile which is in fact one of those methods.

4

00:00:15,330  -->  00:00:16,440
Let's look at a scenario.

5

00:00:16,530  -->  00:00:24,150
Let's say you're a scientist at a store which sells clothes and your store has a total of 100000 customers

6

00:00:24,150  -->  00:00:24,240
.

7

00:00:24,240  -->  00:00:27,900
I'm placing that number on the horizontal axis.

8

00:00:28,170  -->  00:00:35,070
And you know that from experience whenever you send and offer like an e-mail to all your customers or

9

00:00:35,070  -->  00:00:41,160
to any random sample of your customers approximately 10 percent of them respond and purchase the product

10

00:00:41,160  -->  00:00:41,570
.

11

00:00:41,580  -->  00:00:48,170
So I'm going to place 10000 which is 10 percent of the total on the vertical axis.

12

00:00:48,390  -->  00:00:57,030
And so what we're going to do is where we've got an offer that we want to send and we want to see how

13

00:00:57,030  -->  00:00:59,330
many customers are going to purchase our product.

14

00:00:59,340  -->  00:01:06,510
We send it off so if we send it to 0 customers obviously we'll get zero responses right.

15

00:01:06,510  -->  00:01:10,020
What do you think will happen if we send it to 20000 customers.

16

00:01:10,020  -->  00:01:11,500
How many do you think will respond.

17

00:01:11,730  -->  00:01:18,090
Well because this is a random sample and we know that about 10 percent response I would say about 2000

18

00:01:18,090  -->  00:01:18,690
would respond.

19

00:01:18,690  -->  00:01:20,220
Fair enough right.

20

00:01:20,250  -->  00:01:28,740
If 40000 if we send to offer to 40000 of our customers then about 4000 will respond 60000 6000 80000

21

00:01:28,770  -->  00:01:35,560
8000 100000 then 10000 of our customers should respond.

22

00:01:35,610  -->  00:01:43,770
And this is a random selection process so here we can draw a line which will actually represent this

23

00:01:44,250  -->  00:01:51,990
random selection the slope of the line equals to that 10 percent that we know that respond on average

24

00:01:51,990  -->  00:01:55,500
to offer as if we just send them out like that.

25

00:01:55,500  -->  00:02:03,180
Now the question is can we somehow improve this experience can we get more customers to respond to offers

26

00:02:03,730  -->  00:02:12,180
when we send out our letter so basically Can we somehow target our customers more appropriately so to

27

00:02:12,180  -->  00:02:14,050
get a better response rate.

28

00:02:14,190  -->  00:02:21,690
And how about instead of sending out these offers randomly to say a random sample of 20000 customers

29

00:02:21,690  -->  00:02:21,900
.

30

00:02:21,900  -->  00:02:26,810
How would we pick and choose the customers we send these offers to and how do we pick and choose.

31

00:02:26,820  -->  00:02:32,160
Well to start off with let's build a model just like we did in the previous section.

32

00:02:32,160  -->  00:02:34,510
Basically a customer segmentation model.

33

00:02:34,730  -->  00:02:40,110
Joe German graphic segmentation model but which won't predict whether or not they will leave the company

34

00:02:40,440  -->  00:02:43,550
it will actually predict whether or not they will purchase the product.

35

00:02:43,560  -->  00:02:45,590
It's a very simple process actually.

36

00:02:45,600  -->  00:02:51,020
In fact it's the same thing because purchased is also a binary variable yes or no.

37

00:02:51,150  -->  00:02:53,030
And we can also run the same experiment.

38

00:02:53,040  -->  00:02:58,290
We can take a group of customers before we send out the offer and then look back and see who purchased

39

00:02:58,490  -->  00:02:59,890
where the male or female.

40

00:02:59,940  -->  00:03:01,930
Which country were they in.

41

00:03:02,310  -->  00:03:04,670
What age predominantly were they.

42

00:03:04,800  -->  00:03:08,450
Were they browsing on mobile were they browsing via a computer.

43

00:03:08,610  -->  00:03:14,820
And all of these factors we can take them into account measure them put them into a logistic regression

44

00:03:15,270  -->  00:03:22,320
and get a model which will help us assess the likelihood of certain types of customers purchasing based

45

00:03:22,320  -->  00:03:27,600
on their characteristics are they job and demographic status and and other characteristics.

46

00:03:28,050  -->  00:03:34,830
And once we've built this model how about we apply it to select customers we will send the offer to

47

00:03:34,830  -->  00:03:35,010
.

48

00:03:35,010  -->  00:03:41,310
So what the model will tell us like just like in the example in the previous section where females of

49

00:03:41,370  -->  00:03:47,130
female customers of a bank whose favorite color is red they're most likely to leave the bag here will

50

00:03:47,130  -->  00:03:48,000
have a similar result.

51

00:03:48,010  -->  00:03:56,260
Ill say perhaps male customers in this certain age group who browse and mobile are most likely to purchase

52

00:03:56,260  -->  00:03:56,870
a product.

53

00:03:56,880  -->  00:04:03,330
It will tell us something or ill actually rank our customers will give them a probability of purchasing

54

00:04:03,330  -->  00:04:07,620
our product and then we can use that probability to actually contact our customers.

55

00:04:07,620  -->  00:04:13,590
So of course if we contact 0 customers we'll get zero response rate but if we contact 20000 we'll probably

56

00:04:13,590  -->  00:04:20,700
get a much higher response rate than just 2000 because we're picking out the customers that are at the

57

00:04:20,730  -->  00:04:23,370
highest risk of accepting this offer.

58

00:04:23,370  -->  00:04:30,150
We know from their previous behavior from the previous behavior of customers similar to them that they

59

00:04:30,150  -->  00:04:36,330
have a 90 percent chance or an 80 percent chance of purchasing this product and we will go for them

60

00:04:36,330  -->  00:04:36,910
first.

61

00:04:36,930  -->  00:04:42,030
We will put them at the top of our list of people who would contact then when we contact that they would

62

00:04:42,030  -->  00:04:44,780
contact not 20000 but 40000.

63

00:04:44,850  -->  00:04:50,340
Our response rate will be higher than 4000 which we get in the random scenario.

64

00:04:50,990  -->  00:04:56,800
If we if our model is really good then by the time we're at around around 60 thousand so more than just

65

00:04:56,810  -->  00:05:04,910
over half of our total customer base we are really getting to that 10000 mark so we know that 10000

66

00:05:04,900  -->  00:05:06,850
people will respond in total.

67

00:05:06,860  -->  00:05:13,330
There's no way we can get above that because that's just the response rate if we contact everybody it'll

68

00:05:13,330  -->  00:05:15,520
be 10000 but we're getting very close already.

69

00:05:15,520  -->  00:05:20,770
So even at 60000 we're already at nine and a half thousand respondents or purchases.

70

00:05:20,880  -->  00:05:22,600
We we could actually stop here.

71

00:05:22,610  -->  00:05:24,400
We've already pretty much contacted everyone.

72

00:05:24,560  -->  00:05:30,980
But if we want to contact more if we send it out to 80000 we're getting even closer to 10000 responses

73

00:05:31,000  -->  00:05:31,090
.

74

00:05:31,250  -->  00:05:36,870
And if we contact 100000 we will still be back at our 10000 responses.

75

00:05:37,030  -->  00:05:41,300
So now let's draw a line through these crosses.

76

00:05:41,360  -->  00:05:47,520
So what do you see this line here is called the cumulative accuracy profile of your model.

77

00:05:47,890  -->  00:05:54,590
And as you can imagine the better your model the larger will be the the area under the slides so the

78

00:05:54,580  -->  00:05:59,990
area between the red and the blue lines it will increase as your model gets better.

79

00:05:59,990  -->  00:06:05,230
And if your model is worse then this red line will be closer to the blue line so it'll be closer to

80

00:06:05,240  -->  00:06:06,510
random.

81

00:06:06,610  -->  00:06:12,240
The next step we want to do is convert these axes from absolute values to percentages.

82

00:06:12,280  -->  00:06:19,190
So for so they range from zero to 100 percent and this is how the cap kirpan is normally represented

83

00:06:19,190  -->  00:06:19,940
.

84

00:06:19,940  -->  00:06:25,580
Now let's say we ran another regression model and this time we used less variables listen to variables

85

00:06:25,570  -->  00:06:32,830
or just because we had less access to independent variables or we didn't see that there a multicollinearity

86

00:06:32,830  -->  00:06:36,030
effect in a model or something else that went wrong.

87

00:06:36,050  -->  00:06:39,260
And that model because it will be worse.

88

00:06:39,400  -->  00:06:44,800
This is what its cap curve will look like and therefore by plotting the cap curves you'll be able to

89

00:06:44,810  -->  00:06:50,710
compare models to each other and understand how much gain this is also sometimes called the gain chart

90

00:06:50,930  -->  00:06:57,640
how much gain you get in each of these models compared to the random scenario or how much again you

91

00:06:57,640  -->  00:07:03,400
get additional gain you get from switching from one model to the next or from the green one to the red

92

00:07:03,400  -->  00:07:08,470
one for instance you're improving your hit ratio and therefore you're improving your return on investment

93

00:07:08,480  -->  00:07:08,880
.

94

00:07:08,890  -->  00:07:11,900
So therefore the read model is better.

95

00:07:11,930  -->  00:07:14,650
And this is how we are going to be assessing models.

96

00:07:14,660  -->  00:07:21,200
So let's label them the blue line is a random selection process like a monkey could do that you just

97

00:07:21,190  -->  00:07:27,700
pick out random sample and you send the letter or you just send it to everybody and you get 100 percent

98

00:07:27,740  -->  00:07:29,450
of respondents.

99

00:07:29,440  -->  00:07:31,530
The green line is a poor model.

100

00:07:31,610  -->  00:07:37,990
So it's it's a model is better than random but it's still not as good as the red one the red one is

101

00:07:38,000  -->  00:07:45,200
a good model as you can see here or around the 50 percent mark we're getting just over 80 percent response's

102

00:07:45,190  -->  00:07:47,110
that's considered a good model.

103

00:07:47,240  -->  00:07:53,290
And there's one more line that you can think of here and it's this line.

104

00:07:53,650  -->  00:07:55,790
This line is the ideal line.

105

00:07:56,200  -->  00:08:05,410
And this is what would happen if you had a crystal ball if you could predict exactly who is going to

106

00:08:05,410  -->  00:08:07,640
purchase and contact those people.

107

00:08:07,630  -->  00:08:09,140
This is what it would look like.

108

00:08:09,130  -->  00:08:09,500
Why.

109

00:08:09,500  -->  00:08:18,100
Well because if you look at that the place where that spline occurs you'll see that it's exactly 10

110

00:08:18,110  -->  00:08:20,380
percent and 10 percent as you remember.

111

00:08:20,440  -->  00:08:24,210
We know that only 10 percent of our customers ever purchase.

112

00:08:24,230  -->  00:08:31,790
So basically you're saying that on the horizontal axis I'm going to take 10 percent and each and every

113

00:08:31,780  -->  00:08:36,290
single one of those customers I pick and that 10 percent they are going to be those that purchase.

114

00:08:36,320  -->  00:08:42,960
That means I will go right straight to 100 percent with this last scenario.

115

00:08:42,990  -->  00:08:45,710
This actually took me a while to get my head around.

116

00:08:45,880  -->  00:08:51,820
When I first heard about it because I never understood why the spline at the top why does it break like

117

00:08:51,830  -->  00:08:52,100
that.

118

00:08:52,220  -->  00:08:57,280
But that's exactly the reason because you you mad you can imagine that you have a crystal ball and your

119

00:08:57,280  -->  00:09:05,330
contact in the first 10 percent or however many in your specific business scenario customers ever purchase

120

00:09:05,330  -->  00:09:10,870
you contact them right away and then it's just flat from there because it doesn't matter how many more

121

00:09:10,880  -->  00:09:12,180
you contact they're not going to purchase.

122

00:09:12,180  -->  00:09:14,660
That's just the reality of things.

123

00:09:14,950  -->  00:09:20,660
And that is the curves that you have on a cap curve if you ever see a model that goes under the blue

124

00:09:20,650  -->  00:09:21,190
line.

125

00:09:21,380  -->  00:09:22,630
I didn't even draw one here.

126

00:09:22,630  -->  00:09:31,600
But if that happens that's a very bad model is basically doing you a disservice if it's if you see the

127

00:09:31,610  -->  00:09:36,020
curve on the blue line and we'll talk about model deterioration further in the course when you're talking

128

00:09:36,010  -->  00:09:38,240
about maintaining your models.

129

00:09:38,330  -->  00:09:43,630
So that's it for the cap curve for the introduction of Kepcher will be using the cap curve very actively

130

00:09:43,630  -->  00:09:45,860
in this section to assess our model.

131

00:09:45,980  -->  00:09:51,580
And in fact we've actually built two of them and one for a model and one for our test data so that will

132

00:09:51,590  -->  00:09:53,530
be very interesting to compare.

133

00:09:53,540  -->  00:10:00,320
One last thing I wanted to mention is and note that we have the cap which is a cumulative accuracy profile

134

00:10:00,590  -->  00:10:04,140
and we have a rock which is a receiver operating characteristic.

135

00:10:04,340  -->  00:10:12,560
A lot of people get these things confused and I myself included I used to get it confused I even tried

136

00:10:12,560  -->  00:10:20,050
proving one time a colleague of mine who knew this stuff really well at the time when I was just learning

137

00:10:20,060  -->  00:10:26,380
it that she was wrong because that was a funny experience but they're not the same thing.

138

00:10:26,380  -->  00:10:31,540
So cumulative accuracy profiles when we talked about receiver operating characteristics we won't be

139

00:10:31,550  -->  00:10:33,580
covering this course.

140

00:10:33,620  -->  00:10:37,000
It'll be in my advanced course on statistics.

141

00:10:37,070  -->  00:10:42,320
It's very similar it looks similar and that's why a lot of people get confused and actually I think

142

00:10:42,670  -->  00:10:46,100
the other reason is that the rock curve is in Wikipedia.

143

00:10:46,100  -->  00:10:51,070
There's an article for their occur but there isn't one in English for the cumulative accuracy profile

144

00:10:51,200  -->  00:10:51,540
.

145

00:10:51,760  -->  00:11:00,170
So it's quite hard to find information on the cap curve just by searching in Google so maybe you'll

146

00:11:00,160  -->  00:11:04,510
be the first person to write say the article on the cap curve.

147

00:11:04,510  -->  00:11:07,020
Who knows maybe.

148

00:11:07,250  -->  00:11:13,550
Anyway I look forward to seeing the next tutorial and where we will be working with the cap curve.

149

00:11:13,930  -->  00:11:15,690
And until then happy analyzing
