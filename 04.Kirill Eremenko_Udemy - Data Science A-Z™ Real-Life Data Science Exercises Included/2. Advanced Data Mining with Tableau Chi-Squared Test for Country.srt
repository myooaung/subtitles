00:00:01,350  -->  00:00:07,490
Hello this is the solution to the tutorial about the chi squared test.

2

00:00:07,740  -->  00:00:15,660
And remember we had some homework we had to look at these variables over here so for geography we had

3

00:00:15,660  -->  00:00:18,150
observed values and we need to run a square test.

4

00:00:18,210  -->  00:00:21,250
So let's go ahead and do that.

5

00:00:21,400  -->  00:00:24,100
And the show going to get rid of these.

6

00:00:24,330  -->  00:00:26,000
Going to add a new column here.

7

00:00:26,040  -->  00:00:29,050
This is our template for Cascade test.

8

00:00:29,160  -->  00:00:37,380
So let's give these names France Germany and Spain.

9

00:00:38,450  -->  00:00:42,770
Ok and now I'm just going to copy the values from our test.

10

00:00:42,780  -->  00:00:45,750
So here actually I want to get rid of those as well.

11

00:00:45,780  -->  00:00:52,620
I'm going to copy the values from our PowerPoint and I'm just going to copy the formats

12

00:00:55,290  -->  00:00:59,090
and now I just want to make sure that these are OK.

13

00:00:59,880  -->  00:01:06,230
See that's not OK because it's not taking everything so I need all plus plus plus plus.

14

00:01:06,690  -->  00:01:13,630
This is all right so I need to get these again all plus plus plus plus plus plus.

15

00:01:13,620  -->  00:01:17,550
And what do we have here plus plus.

16

00:01:17,730  -->  00:01:22,400
So in short it was faster to just recreate the table from scratch.

17

00:01:22,620  -->  00:01:26,340
Just make sure that you adding up everything you're adding a buried thing.

18

00:01:26,350  -->  00:01:27,890
10000 makes sense.

19

00:01:28,110  -->  00:01:28,460
All right.

20

00:01:28,470  -->  00:01:31,040
So this what do we have here.

21

00:01:31,140  -->  00:01:32,900
Get rid of the totals again.

22

00:01:33,060  -->  00:01:40,850
Copy these over and let's maybe we'll move this up a little bit so we have more space.

23

00:01:41,160  -->  00:01:43,740
So now let's copy our results.

24

00:01:43,740  -->  00:01:46,470
This will need to redo.

25

00:01:46,590  -->  00:01:48,250
Let's check this.

26

00:01:48,270  -->  00:01:52,750
This is called taking the correct column taking that dividing by that and multiply by that.

27

00:01:52,770  -->  00:01:54,580
That's good.

28

00:01:54,710  -->  00:02:00,030
Divide that divide by that multiply by that that's that that that's good.

29

00:02:00,030  -->  00:02:00,830
That looks good.

30

00:02:00,830  -->  00:02:06,240
So we just have to basically copy if you've locked your cells using the dollar signs then copying them

31

00:02:06,240  -->  00:02:08,190
should work fine for you.

32

00:02:08,220  -->  00:02:10,320
So I'm just going to add another row.

33

00:02:10,340  -->  00:02:16,490
All plus plus plus plus plus plus plus plus plus plus.

34

00:02:17,100  -->  00:02:21,310
And so she can see something is wrong here and something is actually wrong here.

35

00:02:21,330  -->  00:02:28,050
What it's doing now plus plus some those so that's something I should have picked up which we actually

36

00:02:28,050  -->  00:02:29,110
want those.

37

00:02:29,310  -->  00:02:33,520
And here as well we want to some these.

38

00:02:33,810  -->  00:02:39,950
All right so this one second some of those this is taking some of those has good looks good now.

39

00:02:39,960  -->  00:02:46,770
So now let's run S.H. I test actual ranges.

40

00:02:46,770  -->  00:02:48,210
This one so it doesn't matter.

41

00:02:48,210  -->  00:02:50,000
We have more rows now.

42

00:02:50,010  -->  00:02:52,680
It can as long as it's the same number.

43

00:02:52,680  -->  00:02:56,800
Same type of table in actual and expected run.

44

00:02:57,330  -->  00:03:04,410
So those are P-value very very low P-value which is good which means there's a significance level not

45

00:03:04,410  -->  00:03:05,240
random.

46

00:03:05,250  -->  00:03:09,860
So now let's go ahead and do the same thing but using this tool.

47

00:03:09,900  -->  00:03:10,460
All right.

48

00:03:10,500  -->  00:03:12,860
We all just have let's see if we can copy it like that.

49

00:03:13,050  -->  00:03:14,400
No we can't.

50

00:03:14,550  -->  00:03:14,930
OK.

51

00:03:14,970  -->  00:03:18,360
We're going to have to copy them one by one.

52

00:03:18,360  -->  00:03:20,370
There you go.

53

00:03:21,660  -->  00:03:25,190
And just one more left.

54

00:03:25,200  -->  00:03:27,780
All right so let's calculate.

55

00:03:27,840  -->  00:03:29,100
So here you got your totals.

56

00:03:29,100  -->  00:03:30,640
Just making sure it's same.

57

00:03:30,660  -->  00:03:31,800
You've got the totals here.

58

00:03:31,800  -->  00:03:33,020
Make sure it's the same.

59

00:03:33,130  -->  00:03:35,000
Now let's focus on this.

60

00:03:35,430  -->  00:03:37,500
If you look here P-value is tiny.

61

00:03:37,530  -->  00:03:39,080
Very very small.

62

00:03:39,090  -->  00:03:39,900
What does that mean.

63

00:03:39,900  -->  00:03:42,230
That means the effect is not random.

64

00:03:42,240  -->  00:03:45,060
There is some correlation.

65

00:03:45,060  -->  00:03:51,720
So basically the outcome is not independent of the country variable.

66

00:03:51,720  -->  00:03:58,530
So that's how you run a chi squared test for three categories you can run a case score just for as many

67

00:03:58,530  -->  00:04:00,170
categories as you like.

68

00:04:00,540  -->  00:04:04,440
And it's very it's the same approach every single time.

69

00:04:04,470  -->  00:04:07,330
Hope you are successful with this homework.

70

00:04:07,620  -->  00:04:12,750
And hopefully it will help you solidify your knowledge about the chi square test.

71

00:04:12,750  -->  00:04:15,560
And I look forward to seeing you back in the course.

72

00:04:15,600  -->  00:04:17,220
Until then happy analyzing
