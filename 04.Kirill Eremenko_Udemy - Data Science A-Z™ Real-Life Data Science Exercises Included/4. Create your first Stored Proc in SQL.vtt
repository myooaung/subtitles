00:00:02.520  -->  00:00:07.300
By now you have already noticed that the queries you write in Asgill are not saved anywhere.

2

00:00:07.440  -->  00:00:08.790
You can save them if you want.

3

00:00:08.790  -->  00:00:14.460
By pressing cardinal s However in that case they will simply be saved this text files on your hard drive

4

00:00:14.460  -->  00:00:14.850
.

5

00:00:14.880  -->  00:00:18.600
They will be added to your SQL Server Management Studio.

6

00:00:18.840  -->  00:00:24.690
Scripts allow us to query daughter and manipulate it similar to what we do in Excel but in Excel it's

7

00:00:24.690  -->  00:00:26.280
a bit more visual.

8

00:00:26.700  -->  00:00:28.170
However the concept is the same.

9

00:00:28.170  -->  00:00:33.670
Anyway if you think about it the manipulations you perform in Excel are also not saved anywhere.

10

00:00:33.690  -->  00:00:39.990
There is no camera recording what you're doing with your mouse and keyboard at the end of the day all

11

00:00:39.990  -->  00:00:44.850
you have is your file resolved with no traceability of how exactly you got there.

12

00:00:45.060  -->  00:00:47.910
But that's not good enough for us as data scientists.

13

00:00:47.910  -->  00:00:53.690
We want to increase the transparency or audit ability and repeatability of our code.

14

00:00:53.700  -->  00:01:00.830
That's why in this section we will create stored procedures or prox to save your DTL code search procedures

15

00:01:00.840  -->  00:01:01.900
are extremely easy.

16

00:01:01.920  -->  00:01:04.020
Let's get straight into it.

17

00:01:04.080  -->  00:01:06.540
Expand your program build the folder.

18

00:01:07.050  -->  00:01:09.870
Now open your stored procedures folder.

19

00:01:10.260  -->  00:01:14.820
Right click the stored procedures folder and select stored procedure.

20

00:01:14.820  -->  00:01:20.570
This brings up a new script with lots of overwhelming code which hopefully will trim it down first.

21

00:01:20.760  -->  00:01:29.100
Get rid of the comments at the top and replace them with familiar use Diest training go in the next

22

00:01:29.100  -->  00:01:37.870
comments section fill in your name date and for description.

23

00:01:37.890  -->  00:01:40.960
Just write a rule then put an arrow.

24

00:01:41.160  -->  00:01:42.870
Work.

25

00:01:42.870  -->  00:01:45.900
Also I like to add a fourth row here for modifications.

26

00:01:45.900  -->  00:01:49.880
Simply call it mode date and leave it empty.

27

00:01:50.280  -->  00:01:57.490
Next delete everything between the words procedure and as we won't be needing any of that replace procedure

28

00:01:57.500  -->  00:01:59.180
of simply proc cause it's shorter.

29

00:01:59.190  -->  00:02:02.030
And then just specify a name for a proc.

30

00:02:02.310  -->  00:02:06.270
Unfortunately you don't have lots of room for creativity here in this template.

31

00:02:06.270  -->  00:02:13.530
I'd advise to store all your proc said build tables with abreviation be L.D. then put an underscore

32

00:02:13.530  -->  00:02:13.730
.

33

00:02:13.860  -->  00:02:15.310
Then work.

34

00:02:15.330  -->  00:02:23.490
So w r k because we are building a work table from a table and then another underscore and then the

35

00:02:23.490  -->  00:02:31.350
same name you find in the row table between the word row and the date when the table was uploaded and

36

00:02:31.350  -->  00:02:32.250
that's it for the name.

37

00:02:32.250  -->  00:02:38.760
You don't need a date in the prox name because the date is stored inside the proc itself in the comments

38

00:02:39.120  -->  00:02:40.770
over here.

39

00:02:40.770  -->  00:02:45.930
Now let's look at everything between the words beginning and everything you put in here is called the

40

00:02:45.930  -->  00:02:47.090
body of the proc.

41

00:02:47.400  -->  00:02:52.290
We want to delete everything that is in here right now and we want to replace it with a simple select

42

00:02:52.290  -->  00:02:53.030
statement.

43

00:02:53.250  -->  00:02:56.240
We will select all rows from our row table

44

00:02:59.160  -->  00:02:59.760
and above that.

45

00:02:59.760  -->  00:03:09.960
Let's type in a comment saying this is my first proc click of 5 or the exit queued button to run the

46

00:03:09.960  -->  00:03:11.220
script.

47

00:03:11.230  -->  00:03:14.340
Now close the script window before saving anything.

48

00:03:14.670  -->  00:03:18.270
Let's refresh the stored procedures folder.

49

00:03:18.500  -->  00:03:20.210
Your proc has been created.

50

00:03:20.250  -->  00:03:23.290
Right click it and select modify.

51

00:03:23.310  -->  00:03:26.550
Here you can see that all of your code has been saved.

52

00:03:26.550  -->  00:03:27.070
There you go.

53

00:03:27.090  -->  00:03:28.950
You have created your first proc
