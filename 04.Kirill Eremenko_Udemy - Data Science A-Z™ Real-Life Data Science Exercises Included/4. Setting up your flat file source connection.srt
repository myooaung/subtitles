1

00:00:02,020  -->  00:00:05,770
In this tutorial we will set up our flat false source connection.

2

00:00:05,790  -->  00:00:11,510
The first step in this process is to take a file We're going to be uploading and place it into the uploads

3

00:00:11,520  -->  00:00:12,070
folder.

4

00:00:12,210  -->  00:00:13,650
Let's do that.

5

00:00:13,650  -->  00:00:15,060
This is our project folder.

6

00:00:15,210  -->  00:00:18,390
We have already prepared the file in the previous section of the course.

7

00:00:18,390  -->  00:00:22,140
Currently it is located in the prepared folder.

8

00:00:22,170  -->  00:00:24,310
Let's go and copy it.

9

00:00:24,420  -->  00:00:28,540
Now we need to go to the uploaded data folder here.

10

00:00:28,560  -->  00:00:32,960
We will create a subfolder with today's date as the name.

11

00:00:32,960  -->  00:00:34,720
Now paste or fall into this folder.

12

00:00:34,740  -->  00:00:38,240
This is the file that we're going to be uploaded to the database.

13

00:00:38,370  -->  00:00:46,470
Copy the folder path and go back to Sosias Now double click the flat file source box in the flood file

14

00:00:46,470  -->  00:00:47,310
connection manager.

15

00:00:47,310  -->  00:00:54,060
You need to click and you click Browse and paste to Poth you cannot see any files right now because

16

00:00:54,060  -->  00:00:57,340
by default the tool is looking for the X Files.

17

00:00:57,510  -->  00:01:01,260
Click the dropdown at the bottom of the window and select CSFB files.

18

00:01:01,380  -->  00:01:03,720
Select your file and click open.

19

00:01:03,760  -->  00:01:07,790
Now that we have found the file we will set up the flat file manager.

20

00:01:08,190  -->  00:01:11,670
First give the connection manager a recognizable name.

21

00:01:11,670  -->  00:01:18,600
I prefer to simply copy the name of the file the next change the text qualifier from none to quotation

22

00:01:18,600  -->  00:01:19,380
marks.

23

00:01:19,380  -->  00:01:24,210
This ensures that data in your CACP file is recognized correctly.

24

00:01:24,270  -->  00:01:31,110
Also it is important to make sure that the checkbox saying column names in the first row is checked

25

00:01:31,110  -->  00:01:31,560
.

26

00:01:31,560  -->  00:01:36,630
This simply means that the first row of your file contains headers and the actual data starts from the

27

00:01:36,630  -->  00:01:37,970
second row.

28

00:01:38,190  -->  00:01:39,840
It is checked by default for us.

29

00:01:39,840  -->  00:01:45,570
However in earlier versions of Visual Studio this option was not selected by default.

30

00:01:45,660  -->  00:01:48,290
We don't need any of the other controls in this window.

31

00:01:48,300  -->  00:01:52,830
Now let's click columns in the options on the left.

32

00:01:52,890  -->  00:01:54,960
Here you have a preview of your daughter.

33

00:01:54,990  -->  00:01:58,890
The beauty of using a c a c file is that it's very very simple.

34

00:01:59,040  -->  00:02:05,250
We know for sure that the row delimiter will always be the carriage return line feed sequence and the

35

00:02:05,250  -->  00:02:07,790
column delimiter will always be a comma.

36

00:02:08,160  -->  00:02:14,080
This means that we don't have to worry about these two menus and should leave them at default.

37

00:02:14,460  -->  00:02:16,030
Now preview your data.

38

00:02:16,080  -->  00:02:19,840
This is quick and easy scroll as far to the right as possible.

39

00:02:19,870  -->  00:02:21,980
You need to check for two things.

40

00:02:21,990  -->  00:02:28,140
Check number 1 make sure that the last column is the same one as in the file that you prepared and that

41

00:02:28,140  -->  00:02:30,380
there are no extra empty columns to the right.

42

00:02:30,510  -->  00:02:33,010
If you find extra columns on the right that shouldn't be there.

43

00:02:33,180  -->  00:02:38,010
That means that you see every file contained empty columns and you should revisit the previous step

44

00:02:38,220  -->  00:02:40,660
preparing your CAC file before the load.

45

00:02:40,950  -->  00:02:44,150
If those columns are not required they should be deleted.

46

00:02:44,820  -->  00:02:45,890
Check number 2.

47

00:02:45,900  -->  00:02:52,020
Now scroll down as far as you possibly can and while you're doing this look at all of the cells in the

48

00:02:52,020  -->  00:02:57,580
last column and see if they have the correct type that you would expect based on the columns name.

49

00:02:57,630  -->  00:02:59,370
In this case and number.

50

00:02:59,370  -->  00:03:03,930
This check allows you to make sure that none of the rows available in the preview got skewed because

51

00:03:03,930  -->  00:03:05,870
of a data anomaly.

52

00:03:06,450  -->  00:03:10,120
A lot of data scientists skipped this step considering it too trivial.

53

00:03:10,530  -->  00:03:12,060
However I still always do it.

54

00:03:12,060  -->  00:03:16,840
I have done hundreds of these uploads and still I perform this check.

55

00:03:16,950  -->  00:03:21,650
Finding an error this way will save you a lot of time down the track.

56

00:03:21,960  -->  00:03:26,300
If all is good then move onto that one step in the menu on the left.

57

00:03:26,310  -->  00:03:28,840
This is a vital part of your upload.

58

00:03:28,920  -->  00:03:33,370
If you wanted to here you could specify the data types for your columns.

59

00:03:33,390  -->  00:03:35,370
A lot of analysts do that right here.

60

00:03:35,370  -->  00:03:37,890
However I will show you a much better method.

61

00:03:37,980  -->  00:03:41,970
The method I will show you is way more reliable and safer.

62

00:03:41,970  -->  00:03:43,920
I won't go into all the details right now.

63

00:03:43,920  -->  00:03:48,480
You will see how the whole picture will fall into place as we progress through this part of the course

64

00:03:48,480  -->  00:03:48,930
.

65

00:03:48,930  -->  00:03:55,270
However what we will be doing here now is uploading all of our columns as text.

66

00:03:55,290  -->  00:03:58,710
It doesn't matter if it's a name or a date or a number.

67

00:03:58,710  -->  00:04:04,650
Everything will be uploaded into the database as text and then in the database we will sort it all out

68

00:04:04,650  -->  00:04:05,460
.

69

00:04:05,460  -->  00:04:11,160
If you click through the columns you will see that all of them have already been recognized by Sosias

70

00:04:11,190  -->  00:04:12,170
as text.

71

00:04:12,240  -->  00:04:15,700
This is indicated by the datatype string over here.

72

00:04:16,320  -->  00:04:18,650
That's a good start but there is one little problem.

73

00:04:18,660  -->  00:04:24,540
SSA wants to save space and therefore has only allocated 50 characters to every single data element

74

00:04:25,350  -->  00:04:27,350
that is not much at all.

75

00:04:27,350  -->  00:04:33,730
And if we have a cell that contains 51 characters then our upload will produce a truncation error.

76

00:04:34,050  -->  00:04:38,280
We need to increase memory allocation and I always said 2000 characters.

77

00:04:38,280  -->  00:04:40,470
This is the safest bet by far.

78

00:04:40,470  -->  00:04:45,020
You can still come across data that has more than 1000 characters but that's rare.

79

00:04:45,030  -->  00:04:51,240
An example of that would be if your column contains freeform text such as customer complaints or comments

80

00:04:52,260  -->  00:04:55,990
hold down the Shift key and select all of your column headers.

81

00:04:56,010  -->  00:05:01,890
Double click the current column with and replace it with 1000 and hit enter.

82

00:05:01,950  -->  00:05:07,000
Now all of your daughter elements will have 1000 characters of storage space.

83

00:05:07,070  -->  00:05:10,780
Go to preview and check your data one more time.

84

00:05:11,130  -->  00:05:13,920
Click OK click ok again.

85

00:05:14,580  -->  00:05:18,560
Now your flat file source and flood file connection manager are ready.

86

00:05:18,990  -->  00:05:21,720
By the way it is important to understand the difference between the two.

87

00:05:21,720  -->  00:05:25,430
The connection to your file is called The Connection Manager.

88

00:05:25,440  -->  00:05:26,930
You can see it here at the bottom.

89

00:05:27,090  -->  00:05:29,550
If you double click on it you will see the menu.

90

00:05:29,550  -->  00:05:34,560
We spent most of our time in now the flat file source is what you see in your diagram.

91

00:05:34,620  -->  00:05:40,030
If you open it up you will see that the flat file source uses the flat file connection manager.

92

00:05:40,050  -->  00:05:42,060
This is just how Sosias works.

93

00:05:42,060  -->  00:05:47,160
The flat file source and connection manager are separate and this means that you can use your connection

94

00:05:47,160  -->  00:05:51,630
manager in many different sources without having to recreate it.

95

00:05:51,630  -->  00:05:57,180
This is applicable to other Sosias projects and we won't be using that in our work but it's good to

96

00:05:57,180  -->  00:05:58,360
know these things.

97

00:05:58,590  -->  00:06:03,390
All right I'll flat file sources ready and you can see that the Red Arrows sign has disappeared in the

98

00:06:03,390  -->  00:06:04,070
next tutorial.

99

00:06:04,080  -->  00:06:05,940
We will set up the destination
