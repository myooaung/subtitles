00:00:00.630  -->  00:00:06.170
Today's tutorial will be split into two parts the first part is for those of you who install their skill

2

00:00:06.180  -->  00:00:10.140
server on your own on your home computer or on your work computer.

3

00:00:10.140  -->  00:00:16.320
Doesn't matter as long as you installed a school server on your own and it's your own Asgill server

4

00:00:16.320  -->  00:00:16.350
.

5

00:00:16.350  -->  00:00:18.030
You can do whatever you want with it.

6

00:00:18.300  -->  00:00:24.710
And the second part will be for those of you who are doing these exercises at work on the work school

7

00:00:24.770  -->  00:00:25.500
server.

8

00:00:25.710  -->  00:00:32.190
So let's get on with the first part here we've got our skills are which we've just installed we're connecting

9

00:00:32.190  -->  00:00:32.930
to it.

10

00:00:33.120  -->  00:00:39.810
And now if we're going to databases you will see here in the object Explorer window on the left you

11

00:00:39.810  -->  00:00:41.940
will see three different items.

12

00:00:42.060  -->  00:00:44.900
So one is a folder with system databases.

13

00:00:44.900  -->  00:00:46.610
We're not going to look at that for now.

14

00:00:46.800  -->  00:00:52.830
And then there's two more databases which are report based databases.

15

00:00:52.830  -->  00:00:54.460
So we're also not going to look at them.

16

00:00:54.540  -->  00:00:59.370
What this is showing us is that there is no actual database for us to work in at this stage.

17

00:00:59.430  -->  00:01:01.390
And right now we're going to create one.

18

00:01:01.740  -->  00:01:07.260
And if you install the SQL Server on your own it is your own instance of a skill server.

19

00:01:07.260  -->  00:01:13.360
It is very easy to create a database you just right click databases and you click new database.

20

00:01:13.600  -->  00:01:20.570
You get this one over here and you give your database a name up at the top you will call it D and D

21

00:01:20.570  -->  00:01:24.270
S training as in data science training.

22

00:01:24.330  -->  00:01:25.280
OK.

23

00:01:25.830  -->  00:01:26.670
And there we go.

24

00:01:26.670  -->  00:01:29.730
So that's our database created right there.

25

00:01:29.730  -->  00:01:35.640
So before we continue I just wanted to say that with this window the Microsoft Eskdale Server Management

26

00:01:35.640  -->  00:01:42.120
Studio we're not going into a lot of detail right now about what means what and where you can click

27

00:01:42.120  -->  00:01:47.010
and where you can click that's just because we will do that further down in the course when we're talking

28

00:01:47.010  -->  00:01:49.200
about a skill scripting right now.

29

00:01:49.200  -->  00:01:55.020
Just please follow along what I'm doing and that will allow you to assess whether or not you're a secure

30

00:01:55.020  -->  00:02:00.080
server is ready and you've got a database that you will be able to work with.

31

00:02:00.160  -->  00:02:01.610
Further down the course.

32

00:02:01.620  -->  00:02:04.330
All right so we've got this database D.S. training.

33

00:02:04.380  -->  00:02:10.390
Now if we expand it you'll see here we've got diagrams tables views and so on.

34

00:02:10.410  -->  00:02:15.900
What we're interested is in tables here this to subfolder system tables and full tables we're not going

35

00:02:15.900  -->  00:02:22.160
to touch them any tables that we create that are for our use will be in the tables folder.

36

00:02:22.170  -->  00:02:23.270
So right now it's empty.

37

00:02:23.400  -->  00:02:29.520
Let's fix that up will quickly create a table and that is just to kind of spice things up.

38

00:02:29.610  -->  00:02:34.560
And also to assess whether or not the database is working correctly.

39

00:02:34.560  -->  00:02:40.620
So to create a table we're going to go to a new query there's a button here or you can just press control

40

00:02:40.620  -->  00:02:41.790
and on your keyboard.

41

00:02:42.000  -->  00:02:48.750
This brings up a blank window and here just fill along and type what I'm typing so we're going to type

42

00:02:48.750  -->  00:02:56.930
create table test table and then bracket's normal brackets.

43

00:02:57.010  -->  00:03:07.620
And here we're going to type in Tim lines nearly done name var char 100 and then comando forget the

44

00:03:07.620  -->  00:03:09.300
combo here.

45

00:03:09.300  -->  00:03:10.520
H.

46

00:03:11.310  -->  00:03:12.040
Int.

47

00:03:12.120  -->  00:03:12.380
OK.

48

00:03:12.390  -->  00:03:16.760
So that is our first very first script in.

49

00:03:16.870  -->  00:03:24.630
SAGAL I know right now it might seem to a lot of you might seem like something completely alien.

50

00:03:24.630  -->  00:03:25.340
It's all right.

51

00:03:25.350  -->  00:03:31.980
Right now we're just testing out so just copy this script and I will show you what to do next and what

52

00:03:31.980  -->  00:03:39.360
we want to do is highlight this part of our workspace and click this execute button up at the top or

53

00:03:39.360  -->  00:03:41.290
hit F5 on your keyboard.

54

00:03:41.940  -->  00:03:48.390
Once you've executed that you should see a command successfully completed message at the bottom here

55

00:03:48.570  -->  00:03:54.090
and now if you go to tables and you're right click and you click refresh you will see your new test

56

00:03:54.090  -->  00:03:55.530
table appear here.

57

00:03:55.890  -->  00:03:56.830
So that's good.

58

00:03:56.850  -->  00:03:59.160
We've got a test table but right now it's empty.

59

00:03:59.160  -->  00:04:02.470
How about we put in this table some values.

60

00:04:02.580  -->  00:04:08.820
So we're going to write another two lines of code so just make some space and once again for long.

61

00:04:08.820  -->  00:04:20.430
So insert into test table and then in brackets we're going to say name age and we're going to insert

62

00:04:20.440  -->  00:04:26.380
values and the values are going to be mapped.

63

00:04:27.240  -->  00:04:28.650
And a couple more.

64

00:04:29.340  -->  00:04:36.330
OK so once we've tap this card once again same thing highlight the two new line of credit and click

65

00:04:36.420  -->  00:04:37.650
execute.

66

00:04:37.650  -->  00:04:38.160
There we go.

67

00:04:38.160  -->  00:04:40.620
It says that three rows have been affected.

68

00:04:40.620  -->  00:04:50.710
Now if we right click our test table and we select select top 1000 rows then what you will see here

69

00:04:50.700  -->  00:04:56.070
ignore the script that's being created for you up there at the bottom in the results pane you will see

70

00:04:56.400  -->  00:05:02.540
a table with three rows and two columns with names and ages which you have just put in.

71

00:05:02.670  -->  00:05:08.560
So if you see that then your database is working correctly and your server is set up well and well done

72

00:05:08.560  -->  00:05:08.690
.

73

00:05:08.690  -->  00:05:11.270
You're ready to proceed with the rest of the course.

74

00:05:11.280  -->  00:05:17.120
Now the second part is for those of you who are doing these exercises on your work your server.

75

00:05:17.340  -->  00:05:23.610
What I wanted to warn you about is that you might find it a bit hard to get things running.

76

00:05:24.120  -->  00:05:31.170
And the reason for that is that the infrastructure in organizations can be very complex.

77

00:05:31.170  -->  00:05:39.450
I'm going to bring up a picture right now and this is common infrastructure set up in a lot of organizations

78

00:05:39.450  -->  00:05:46.530
and doesn't matter what type of organization can be an oil refinery it can be a retail store it can

79

00:05:46.530  -->  00:05:53.760
be a bank it can be either financial situations basically any large organization is very likely to have

80

00:05:53.820  -->  00:06:03.420
this kind of set up of their infrastructure and what it's saying here is that the I.T. process is not

81

00:06:03.420  -->  00:06:08.430
simple is broken up into elements and by the way if you already know all of this if you have an I.T.

82

00:06:08.430  -->  00:06:12.630
background and feel free to skip the rest of the sectorial and move onto the next one.

83

00:06:12.630  -->  00:06:16.980
However I do understand that people taking this course come from different backgrounds.

84

00:06:17.010  -->  00:06:21.630
So I just wanted to quickly highlight what you should be prepared for.

85

00:06:22.020  -->  00:06:29.610
So once some programs or some changes in the I.T. environment are or in the whole of the I-T of the

86

00:06:29.610  -->  00:06:35.200
organization are created were originally created in the development environment so developers create

87

00:06:35.190  -->  00:06:42.960
those programs those scripts those changes those designs they create that and then it is so it is stored

88

00:06:42.960  -->  00:06:43.950
somewhere.

89

00:06:43.950  -->  00:06:52.700
Then there are many intermediary steps for these elements of code and programs to get to the test server

90

00:06:53.010  -->  00:06:53.900
where they're tested.

91

00:06:53.910  -->  00:06:59.340
And this can take weeks months or sometimes even half a year or even a year for something to get to

92

00:06:59.340  -->  00:07:01.500
the test server and then be tested.

93

00:07:01.500  -->  00:07:07.450
And then once it's tested then it moves out into the production server and the production server is

94

00:07:07.440  -->  00:07:10.650
generally the name for the server where things are live.

95

00:07:10.650  -->  00:07:13.270
So transactions are happening.

96

00:07:13.290  -->  00:07:14.550
Records are being updated.

97

00:07:14.550  -->  00:07:19.500
Customers are viewing their invoices or they're making purchases and so on.

98

00:07:19.500  -->  00:07:23.790
So before something gets to production has to go through all these steps and a why am I showing you

99

00:07:23.790  -->  00:07:24.200
this.

100

00:07:24.370  -->  00:07:30.670
Well because first of all I came across this one time myself in a very large organization.

101

00:07:31.020  -->  00:07:38.070
I needed to set up a database just similar to that kind of database wasn't for training or was just

102

00:07:38.070  -->  00:07:38.820
for data signs.

103

00:07:38.820  -->  00:07:46.760
But the reason the issue that I was faced with was that there is no in this kind of legacy type of set

104

00:07:46.760  -->  00:07:50.190
up over an organization that doesn't account for data science.

105

00:07:50.250  -->  00:07:56.760
There may not be a slot where to put your data science database should it go into production should

106

00:07:56.760  -->  00:07:59.780
be a test database should be a development database.

107

00:07:59.850  -->  00:08:03.420
Will people making business decisions be relying on it.

108

00:08:03.810  -->  00:08:05.540
If that's the case it has to be in production.

109

00:08:05.550  -->  00:08:08.680
But on the other hand you're developing things should be in development.

110

00:08:08.740  -->  00:08:19.260
So all of those problems all kind of questions might cause the person in charge of I.T. to be unsure

111

00:08:19.260  -->  00:08:23.980
where to put your database and rightly so so be prepared for that.

112

00:08:24.000  -->  00:08:29.710
And you just have to when you go to your manager or to your DBA you have to explain exactly what you

113

00:08:29.700  -->  00:08:32.070
need that you need a training database.

114

00:08:32.070  -->  00:08:38.040
In this case you won't nobody will be relying on this data for business decisions is just for your training

115

00:08:38.040  -->  00:08:38.070
.

116

00:08:38.070  -->  00:08:43.750
You need to be able to upload data you need to be able to create tables create store procedures manipulate

117

00:08:43.750  -->  00:08:45.270
data and so on.

118

00:08:45.270  -->  00:08:50.600
So basically do all these basic manipulations with data and there are two options here.

119

00:08:50.640  -->  00:08:56.880
Either they will find a way to slot in your training database into the environment and that's great

120

00:08:56.880  -->  00:08:56.910
.

121

00:08:56.910  -->  00:09:01.680
In that case they'll provide you with all the associated credentials for you to be able to log in to

122

00:09:01.680  -->  00:09:02.800
this database.

123

00:09:02.940  -->  00:09:08.760
And in that case just go ahead and create that test table that we did at the start of the tutorial and

124

00:09:08.760  -->  00:09:13.690
populated with those three rows just to make sure that the database is working well and the server is

125

00:09:13.680  -->  00:09:14.670
set up correctly.

126

00:09:14.860  -->  00:09:19.800
And the other option is that if they're not able to provide you with this training database then you

127

00:09:19.800  -->  00:09:25.680
will have to install your own instance of a SQL server whether you can do it at work.

128

00:09:25.680  -->  00:09:30.120
You once again you'll have to ask them or whether you'd have to do it on your own computer.

129

00:09:30.240  -->  00:09:33.450
And in that case just refer to the very start of this tutorial.

130

00:09:33.450  -->  00:09:34.690
So that's that.

131

00:09:34.840  -->  00:09:40.920
Just wanted to make sure you're prepared for your conversation with your DBA or your manager if you

132

00:09:40.920  -->  00:09:43.960
do decide to go down this pathway.
