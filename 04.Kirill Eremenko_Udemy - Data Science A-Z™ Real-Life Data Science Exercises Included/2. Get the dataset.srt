1

00:00:01,380  -->  00:00:03,740
This time we have two data sets.

2

00:00:03,810  -->  00:00:07,850
We've got churn modeling and churn modeling test data.

3

00:00:07,890  -->  00:00:10,120
So let's go ahead and download them.

4

00:00:10,200  -->  00:00:16,940
And once you've done a lot of them put them into a folder and let's open them up and use Excel.

5

00:00:17,520  -->  00:00:20,620
And I'm going to direct churn modeling in here.

6

00:00:20,910  -->  00:00:27,840
And if you've done the section on where the part of the course in his possession this data set will

7

00:00:27,840  -->  00:00:31,870
look extremely familiar because it's actually the same data set.

8

00:00:31,890  -->  00:00:36,330
The only difference is that the stance we file that was an Excel text file.

9

00:00:36,520  -->  00:00:39,210
And well if you haven't it doesn't matter.

10

00:00:39,210  -->  00:00:41,120
We can't will still go through it now.

11

00:00:41,480  -->  00:00:45,660
So I'll just make some space here so we can see everything and.

12

00:00:45,710  -->  00:00:46,000
OK.

13

00:00:45,990  -->  00:00:46,440
Off we go.

14

00:00:46,440  -->  00:00:49,010
So this data says it's got a few columns.

15

00:00:49,100  -->  00:00:52,310
He's got row number customer id surname.

16

00:00:52,320  -->  00:00:57,060
So what we're looking at is a data set of a bank.

17

00:00:57,540  -->  00:00:58,880
Of course it's all fictional.

18

00:00:58,890  -->  00:01:01,700
It's not a real bank but it's very realistic.

19

00:01:01,890  -->  00:01:06,740
And they hear we've got a snapshot of if you scroll down to the bottom.

20

00:01:07,050  -->  00:01:08,850
There's got to be 10000 customers.

21

00:01:08,850  -->  00:01:11,280
So 10000 rows in this data set.

22

00:01:11,940  -->  00:01:19,090
And the what the bank did is they measured some things about these customers.

23

00:01:19,200  -->  00:01:19,470
Right.

24

00:01:19,470  -->  00:01:22,380
Why did why did they undergo this whole thing and what's the challenge.

25

00:01:22,440  -->  00:01:29,550
Well the bank has been seeing unusual churn rates so churn is when people leave the company and they've

26

00:01:29,580  -->  00:01:34,920
seen customers leaving at unusually high rates and they want to understand what the problem is and they

27

00:01:34,920  -->  00:01:37,380
want to assess and address that problem.

28

00:01:37,470  -->  00:01:44,140
And that's why they've hired you to look into this data set for them and give them some insights.

29

00:01:44,220  -->  00:01:46,070
And how did this data set come to be.

30

00:01:46,170  -->  00:01:50,540
Well six months ago the bank said all right there's a big problem.

31

00:01:50,670  -->  00:01:56,910
We've got to take a sample of our customers by the way this is a sample that 10000 is a tiny number

32

00:01:56,910  -->  00:01:57,590
for this bank.

33

00:01:57,600  -->  00:02:04,380
This bank has millions of customers it operates this fictional bank operates in Europe in three countries

34

00:02:04,380  -->  00:02:10,530
France France Spain and Germany and they have lots and lots of customers so what they did is they took

35

00:02:10,530  -->  00:02:17,270
this sample of 10000 customers and they measured six months ago everything they knew about them they

36

00:02:17,300  -->  00:02:25,350
a customer id their surname credit score their geography their gender their age their 10 years so how

37

00:02:25,350  -->  00:02:31,080
long they've been with the bank the balance of the customers at that point in time the number of products

38

00:02:31,200  -->  00:02:32,580
they had at that point in time.

39

00:02:32,580  -->  00:02:37,230
So a number approaches things like how many products do they have to have a savings account have a credit

40

00:02:37,230  -->  00:02:39,930
card do they have a loan.

41

00:02:39,960  -->  00:02:44,130
How did the customer have a credit card or not so there's no yes no flag.

42

00:02:44,280  -->  00:02:46,090
Is the customer an active member.

43

00:02:46,140  -->  00:02:50,680
Another yes no flag active member can be measured differently by different organizations.

44

00:02:50,700  -->  00:02:55,470
It could be whether or not the customer logged into their online banking in the past month whether they

45

00:02:55,470  -->  00:03:03,870
did a transaction in the past two months or some other measure like that and estimated salary so the

46

00:03:03,870  -->  00:03:08,010
bank doesn't know the salary of the customers but based on the other things they know they could estimate

47

00:03:08,040  -->  00:03:11,240
a salary for that customer and that also gave you this information.

48

00:03:11,250  -->  00:03:15,060
So six months ago they measured all of these things and said All right.

49

00:03:15,060  -->  00:03:21,590
So for these 10000 are randomly selected customers are we going to just watch them so we just going

50

00:03:21,590  -->  00:03:27,300
to wait six months and six months on the track we're going to check who all those customers left and

51

00:03:27,300  -->  00:03:28,620
who are those customers state.

52

00:03:28,740  -->  00:03:31,070
And that's what this call them exited or presents here.

53

00:03:31,140  -->  00:03:35,440
It tells you whether or not the person left the bank within those six months.

54

00:03:35,460  -->  00:03:40,310
So this person over here sometime within the six months he left the bank.

55

00:03:40,320  -->  00:03:43,620
And as of a couple of days ago he's no longer with the bank.

56

00:03:43,740  -->  00:03:46,580
This person over here on the other hand is still in the bank.

57

00:03:46,580  -->  00:03:47,610
So there's a Zuri here.

58

00:03:47,640  -->  00:03:51,420
This person left the bank this person stayed and so on.

59

00:03:51,420  -->  00:03:57,690
So if you see a one that means the person is no longer the bank as that person still the bank and your

60

00:03:57,690  -->  00:04:03,540
goal is to create a job demographic segmentation model to tell the bank which of their customers are

61

00:04:03,540  -->  00:04:06,100
at highest risk of leaving.

62

00:04:06,120  -->  00:04:09,900
So we're going to talk more about your demographic segmentation in the next tutorial.

63

00:04:09,900  -->  00:04:14,900
The other thing that I wanted to look at now is the test data set that we have here.

64

00:04:14,900  -->  00:04:16,290
So what is the test data set.

65

00:04:16,290  -->  00:04:22,650
So if I copy it here you'll see that it's exactly the same type of data sets same columns but the only

66

00:04:22,650  -->  00:04:26,780
difference here is that it's different customers so you can see the phone numbers are higher.

67

00:04:26,820  -->  00:04:32,220
The customers idea these are different these different customers and there is there's only a thousand

68

00:04:32,220  -->  00:04:33,040
of them here.

69

00:04:33,270  -->  00:04:35,170
So why have we been given this data set.

70

00:04:35,280  -->  00:04:41,220
Well basically we are going to use this data set as a validation for the model we build using the other

71

00:04:41,220  -->  00:04:47,220
data set and the way this data set was constructed is that is exactly the same six months.

72

00:04:47,240  -->  00:04:50,100
So same periods of time same snapshot.

73

00:04:50,100  -->  00:04:56,790
So basically the bank just literally separated this data set from that one so you have two separate

74

00:04:56,790  -->  00:05:03,540
data sets and that will allow us to assess how much but more on that later when we get to the correct

75

00:05:03,540  -->  00:05:04,020
section.

76

00:05:04,110  -->  00:05:11,460
What I wanted to mention today is that this skill that you're going to learn in this section and upcoming

77

00:05:11,460  -->  00:05:13,370
sections is very transferable.

78

00:05:13,370  -->  00:05:15,240
It doesn't have to be for a bank.

79

00:05:15,240  -->  00:05:18,010
It doesn't have to be for churn rates.

80

00:05:18,140  -->  00:05:25,680
Demographic segmentation models can be applied to millions of scenarios so here for instance even in

81

00:05:25,680  -->  00:05:31,860
a bank the same scenario could work should the person get a loan or not.

82

00:05:31,860  -->  00:05:34,610
Should the person be approved for credit or not.

83

00:05:34,830  -->  00:05:40,730
And once again you'd have a binary outcome so based on prior experience you would know whether or not

84

00:05:40,730  -->  00:05:46,270
a person is reliable and you build a model and say which people are more likely to be reliable and which

85

00:05:46,290  -->  00:05:47,970
people are more likely to default.

86

00:05:48,120  -->  00:05:51,260
And that could govern the bank's decision on whether or not to give loans.

87

00:05:51,330  -->  00:05:57,030
This could be in terms of fraudulent transactions not even in a bank in a different financial institutions

88

00:05:57,030  -->  00:06:02,920
you could find out which transactions are more likely to be fraudulent which are less likely.

89

00:06:02,940  -->  00:06:09,420
There's lots of scenarios where you could apply a demographic segmentation and it doesn't even have

90

00:06:09,420  -->  00:06:10,690
to be your demographic.

91

00:06:10,690  -->  00:06:13,920
So we know that we're going to be using a logistic regression.

92

00:06:14,130  -->  00:06:20,370
And whenever you have a scenario when you have a binary outcome and you have lots of independent variables

93

00:06:20,640  -->  00:06:22,930
you can throw all of that into logistic regression.

94

00:06:22,950  -->  00:06:25,650
And as you'll see in this part of the course.

95

00:06:25,860  -->  00:06:31,110
Build a proper robust logistic regression and that will tell you which factors influence the outcome

96

00:06:31,110  -->  00:06:31,370
.

97

00:06:31,380  -->  00:06:36,780
So go back to our example two brushes you can have here whether or not it's a faulty toothbrush.

98

00:06:36,780  -->  00:06:43,350
And here you can have a myriad of independent variables like as we've discussed what what plastic was

99

00:06:43,350  -->  00:06:47,480
used what temperature at what temperature the to the brush was build.

100

00:06:47,520  -->  00:06:55,320
You could have what other components you added whether or not you added other components to the plastic

101

00:06:55,800  -->  00:07:03,480
or what electrics you used in the tooth brush you could have how long the tooth brush was being created

102

00:07:03,480  -->  00:07:08,790
for you could basically have anything even the humidity in the factory at the time we're making too

103

00:07:08,820  -->  00:07:08,980
much.

104

00:07:08,990  -->  00:07:12,990
So basically it doesn't have to be a customer centric organization.

105

00:07:12,990  -->  00:07:19,770
That's what I'm trying to explain here that you can apply this knowledge is going to learn in any kind

106

00:07:19,770  -->  00:07:20,280
of scenario.

107

00:07:20,280  -->  00:07:24,150
We have biner outcome and lots of independent variables.

108

00:07:24,150  -->  00:07:29,980
And on that note let's jump straight into our modeling section. I'll see you on the next tutorial.

109

00:07:30,120  -->  00:07:32,010
Until then happy analyzing
