00:00:01,210  -->  00:00:04,390
In the first tutorial we learn how to work with aliases.

2

00:00:04,440  -->  00:00:07,440
And today I'll show you how to add a reference line to a chart.

3

00:00:07,530  -->  00:00:11,420
But before we continue I wanted to show you another cool trick in a Tablo.

4

00:00:11,520  -->  00:00:16,020
So here you can see that your labels are order in a specific manner.

5

00:00:16,020  -->  00:00:22,290
First comes the label for the percentage and then the label for the actual class or the classification

6

00:00:22,290  -->  00:00:22,320
.

7

00:00:22,320  -->  00:00:28,110
So if you want to change them all you have to do is drag one on top of the other or change the order

8

00:00:28,120  -->  00:00:30,350
here in the marks pane.

9

00:00:30,420  -->  00:00:35,450
So I'm going to exit and put it above some number exited which is our table calculation.

10

00:00:35,610  -->  00:00:38,710
So now here now you can see that first we see the classification.

11

00:00:38,730  -->  00:00:39,990
And then we see the percentage.

12

00:00:39,990  -->  00:00:45,550
Personally I think this looks better for this type of analysis.

13

00:00:45,870  -->  00:00:47,580
And we'll leave it like that.

14

00:00:47,580  -->  00:00:49,810
Now I'll show you how to add a reference line.

15

00:00:49,920  -->  00:00:52,260
So why would you need to add a reference like.

16

00:00:52,260  -->  00:01:00,270
Well in order to compare your results that you see here with some benchmark and what will our benchmark

17

00:01:00,270  -->  00:01:00,630
be.

18

00:01:00,720  -->  00:01:09,380
Well how about we check how many people exited the company from this sample on average.

19

00:01:09,390  -->  00:01:17,190
So generally speaking we're far out looking at any kind of classification male female country credit

20

00:01:17,190  -->  00:01:18,030
score anything.

21

00:01:18,060  -->  00:01:24,590
We just want to see what is the percentage of people that actually left this company from the sample

22

00:01:25,110  -->  00:01:32,520
and we can create another chart so we can do a simple procedure but omits a classification however because

23

00:01:32,520  -->  00:01:38,970
Tablo so convenient and it's so easy in terms of drag and drop all we have to do here is just take a

24

00:01:38,970  -->  00:01:45,900
gender and remove it from the columns and let's just make some more space and right away you can see

25

00:01:45,990  -->  00:01:52,500
that we've got on the chart so there's no classification here and out of the whole sample there's 80

26

00:01:52,500  -->  00:01:53,520
percent that stayed.

27

00:01:53,520  -->  00:01:54,560
And 20 percent that left.

28

00:01:54,560  -->  00:02:00,570
So now we know that the exit rate is 20 percent and we can always get back to this simple way just to

29

00:02:00,750  -->  00:02:09,480
remove your classification and your chart will collapse into just the overall picture for this whole

30

00:02:09,480  -->  00:02:10,230
sample.

31

00:02:10,230  -->  00:02:13,380
So I'm going to press controls at twice now to return gender.

32

00:02:13,380  -->  00:02:16,410
But now that we know that 20 percent of people left.

33

00:02:16,440  -->  00:02:23,850
How about we add a reference line so that we can then look at look at it and compare our exit rates

34

00:02:23,850  -->  00:02:27,350
and we see four different classes to the overall exit rate.

35

00:02:27,420  -->  00:02:33,930
So we're going to right click the access and here we'll check or select Add Reference line.

36

00:02:34,590  -->  00:02:36,410
And here you've got a couple of options.

37

00:02:36,450  -->  00:02:41,200
So you can add the line you can add a band you can add a distribution you can add a box plug.

38

00:02:41,430  -->  00:02:42,570
Pretty self-explanatory.

39

00:02:42,570  -->  00:02:48,670
We're going to work with a line and we want to add the line for the entire table.

40

00:02:48,870  -->  00:02:51,140
So not per page or per cell.

41

00:02:51,330  -->  00:02:57,960
And here it might be a bit confusing because you've got the first you have to choose the value and it's

42

00:02:58,260  -->  00:03:01,110
it's a bit like nonintuitive which you've got to do here.

43

00:03:01,200  -->  00:03:06,990
Well actually you've got to change this one first here so you can either do the same over a certain

44

00:03:06,990  -->  00:03:12,120
value and this value has to be present in your worksheet.

45

00:03:12,120  -->  00:03:17,970
So that's why you only see this table calculation because that's the only measure that we have present

46

00:03:17,970  -->  00:03:21,480
in our worksheet as when you have more you'll be able to select different ones.

47

00:03:21,630  -->  00:03:26,070
But in this case we don't want some we don't want minimum maximum average median what we want is a constant

48

00:03:26,070  -->  00:03:30,830
and that's why it is a bit confusing because Carson has nothing to do with this specific value of all

49

00:03:30,840  -->  00:03:31,330
the other ones.

50

00:03:31,340  -->  00:03:36,900
Yes they work with the specific value that you choose but it's just like constant the value disappears

51

00:03:36,900  -->  00:03:37,940
and you can enter a constant.

52

00:03:37,950  -->  00:03:39,040
And that's what we need.

53

00:03:39,150  -->  00:03:42,240
So we're going to change this to zero point two.

54

00:03:42,240  -->  00:03:44,270
So that's our average.

55

00:03:44,580  -->  00:03:49,740
Here you can change the label so what will that show we can show nothing you can show the value in show

56

00:03:49,740  -->  00:03:51,570
the computation.

57

00:03:51,570  -->  00:03:56,030
So that's when you have like a computation here you can you can add a custom label.

58

00:03:56,280  -->  00:04:00,840
So in this case we don't want any label because we already have an access which tells us 20 percent

59

00:04:01,440  -->  00:04:05,870
line and so what type of line do you want Joe on the dotted line.

60

00:04:05,920  -->  00:04:08,610
Do you want a small online can change the color.

61

00:04:08,610  -->  00:04:10,810
I'm just going to leave it at the standard line.

62

00:04:10,830  -->  00:04:14,640
So for 20 percent and that's pretty much it.

63

00:04:14,640  -->  00:04:24,210
So once we click OK we've got our 20 percent line and we can see that females exit or female customers

64

00:04:24,240  -->  00:04:30,670
are more likely than customers on average overall and male customers are less liked.

65

00:04:30,720  -->  00:04:33,600
That makes sense because we only have two categories here.

66

00:04:33,600  -->  00:04:38,160
So obviously if one is greater than the other than one is going to be above average one's going to be

67

00:04:38,160  -->  00:04:44,580
below average and that is how you add a reference line to your chart and in the next tutorial we're

68

00:04:44,580  -->  00:04:48,150
going to start replicating this chart for other classifications.

69

00:04:48,150  -->  00:04:49,620
And it's going to be lots of fun.

70

00:04:49,680  -->  00:04:51,020
So I look forward to seeing you then.

71

00:04:51,030  -->  00:04:52,650
Until next time happy be analyzing
