00:00:01,330  -->  00:00:07,860
Grade so last though we talked about creating a template for prox and today I'll give you another handy

2

00:00:08,010  -->  00:00:08,500
trick.

3

00:00:08,520  -->  00:00:13,200
That is not timesaving but is disaster saving.

4

00:00:13,200  -->  00:00:17,870
I would say so this causes we're going to talk about archiving approx.

5

00:00:17,910  -->  00:00:19,790
And a very important step.

6

00:00:19,860  -->  00:00:25,320
So if let's say I'm working on transactional data and you see here that I have these converts and I've

7

00:00:25,320  -->  00:00:29,860
decided actually I don't really need these converts I want to change something in this proc.

8

00:00:29,970  -->  00:00:37,050
Well you once you've changed something you've save the proc you don't have that previous version right

9

00:00:37,050  -->  00:00:37,080
.

10

00:00:37,080  -->  00:00:41,820
So you have at least you have what you've saved which is good but you don't have the previous version

11

00:00:41,880  -->  00:00:49,350
and a good way to to archive your prox or to save it is to archive the current version as is before

12

00:00:49,350  -->  00:00:50,190
you make the change.

13

00:00:50,340  -->  00:00:51,340
So how do you do that.

14

00:00:51,450  -->  00:00:57,240
Well once you have the proc open so let's say I want to modify this proc but I want to save the version

15

00:00:57,270  -->  00:00:58,230
as it is right now.

16

00:00:58,230  -->  00:01:04,500
So first thing click modify alter so you have this code in front of you when you're in your script in

17

00:01:04,500  -->  00:01:05,790
a skill.

18

00:01:05,850  -->  00:01:14,970
Now before you do any changes before you do anything go to this proc and original that you just opened

19

00:01:15,060  -->  00:01:16,740
and changed the name.

20

00:01:16,740  -->  00:01:25,650
So at the start put in zeds it said That's what I usually put underscore b c keep b c k p and then the

21

00:01:25,650  -->  00:01:32,920
date 2000 underscore actually underscore Day 2015 0 8 10 and then underscore.

22

00:01:32,940  -->  00:01:34,650
So what does this tell me.

23

00:01:34,680  -->  00:01:36,690
First of all when they click enter.

24

00:01:36,720  -->  00:01:41,310
This means that this proc will automatically because it does with a zed who will dramatically go to

25

00:01:41,310  -->  00:01:45,640
the bottom of my of this Kema.

26

00:01:45,660  -->  00:01:50,760
So we don't we didn't talk about Skinner's reskill go to the bottom of of this folder of the stored

27

00:01:50,760  -->  00:01:51,850
procedures folder.

28

00:01:51,930  -->  00:01:54,570
And that means it won't bother me anymore it'll be at the bottom.

29

00:01:54,600  -->  00:02:00,580
I know I have at the top I have all of my templates at the bottom I have all of my other prox or all

30

00:02:00,580  -->  00:02:01,640
of the backups.

31

00:02:01,830  -->  00:02:05,300
And in the middle I have all the stuff that I'm working with.

32

00:02:05,430  -->  00:02:11,610
And once you have you know a hundred projects that you're working with It'll be very convenient that

33

00:02:11,610  -->  00:02:16,950
these backups and these templates are not in your way there at the top at the bottom and also be convenient

34

00:02:16,950  -->  00:02:19,440
that they actually have all the same structure.

35

00:02:19,440  -->  00:02:24,930
So once you if you ever want to restore something then you just go to the backups which are at the bottom

36

00:02:24,960  -->  00:02:27,050
and you look for the right date and you see.

37

00:02:27,060  -->  00:02:30,250
OK so that's that's a date when I want to restore from.

38

00:02:30,270  -->  00:02:32,620
And there is that table that I was looking for.

39

00:02:32,970  -->  00:02:40,170
And as you recall products from different projects shouldn't mix up because we'll have a separate database

40

00:02:40,170  -->  00:02:41,460
or a separate schema.

41

00:02:41,460  -->  00:02:47,430
Hopefully if you can talk your DBA into it you'll have a separate database schema for every single product

42

00:02:47,590  -->  00:02:48,650
but we get sidetracked.

43

00:02:48,750  -->  00:02:53,720
So I've backed up this proc and now this proc no longer exists.

44

00:02:53,730  -->  00:02:57,650
I can if I run this code if I execute now I'll get an error.

45

00:02:57,750  -->  00:02:58,340
Why.

46

00:02:58,530  -->  00:03:02,790
Well because I'm trying to alter an object that no longer exists.

47

00:03:02,820  -->  00:03:03,870
How do we fix that.

48

00:03:03,870  -->  00:03:04,470
Very simple.

49

00:03:04,470  -->  00:03:08,380
It just changes to create execute.

50

00:03:08,400  -->  00:03:13,070
Now you've exited it successfully So now you're very fresh here.

51

00:03:13,200  -->  00:03:18,210
You'll see that this proc is back here and I already and I have a copy as well.

52

00:03:18,210  -->  00:03:21,780
And now I will go back to my proc.

53

00:03:21,810  -->  00:03:27,660
I'll press contrails Zed to return to alter so I just reverted that operation and now I can change it

54

00:03:27,660  -->  00:03:32,920
as much as I like so if I go here and I changed convert or get rid of the convert.

55

00:03:32,930  -->  00:03:39,840
As we discussed implicit conversion works just fine for us in these cases.

56

00:03:39,840  -->  00:03:41,220
And I click execute.

57

00:03:41,360  -->  00:03:42,820
Voila everything is good.

58

00:03:43,080  -->  00:03:46,660
And now if I close this.

59

00:03:47,190  -->  00:03:47,760
If it closes.

60

00:03:47,760  -->  00:03:55,510
Now if I open up my current proc and then if I open up my backup and I put my backup to the side you

61

00:03:55,610  -->  00:04:01,680
will see that in my current proc there is no implicit explicit conversion in my backup.

62

00:04:01,680  -->  00:04:06,120
There is explicit conversion and so that's how you backup your file.

63

00:04:06,130  -->  00:04:09,590
That's my proposed approach you can come up with your own approaches.

64

00:04:09,600  -->  00:04:16,920
For instance you could press control S and save the file or instead of changing the name here before

65

00:04:16,920  -->  00:04:24,270
you change before you change the proc you could actually use or create and create the backup by by specifying

66

00:04:24,270  -->  00:04:25,330
the Zed's here.

67

00:04:25,530  -->  00:04:28,500
But I think all of that is way more tedious.

68

00:04:28,500  -->  00:04:34,200
This is the Fosse's approach that I've naturally come up with through years of my experience and I'm

69

00:04:34,200  -->  00:04:37,820
happy for you to steal it away and use it in your work.
