00:00:00.540  -->  00:00:06.990
Profession of the future in today's tutorial we will find out why data science is the place to be going

2

00:00:06.990  -->  00:00:09.870
forward in the next couple of years or even decades.

3

00:00:10.020  -->  00:00:13.520
Why this is the profession that you want to be in.

4

00:00:13.950  -->  00:00:15.680
So there's lots of dot in the world.

5

00:00:15.690  -->  00:00:19.100
And ultimately Darra is the resource that our scientists work with.

6

00:00:19.170  -->  00:00:23.100
If there's more data there's more work if there's less data there's less work so let's find out what's

7

00:00:23.100  -->  00:00:28.150
been going on with the data and what will be going on with data in the coming years.

8

00:00:28.380  -->  00:00:30.180
So let's jump straight into it.

9

00:00:30.480  -->  00:00:37.260
Since the dawn of time up until 2005 humans had created.

10

00:00:37.410  -->  00:00:41.910
Are you ready for this one hundred thirty exabytes of data.

11

00:00:42.140  -->  00:00:45.510
Well Carol this tells me absolutely nothing.

12

00:00:45.510  -->  00:00:46.170
Right.

13

00:00:46.170  -->  00:00:47.250
What is an Exabyte.

14

00:00:47.250  -->  00:00:48.610
Why is this impressive.

15

00:00:48.810  -->  00:00:49.910
Well let's start from the ground up.

16

00:00:49.920  -->  00:00:52.940
Let's start with one byte here we've got the letter A.

17

00:00:52.950  -->  00:00:56.580
It takes up exactly one byte of space.

18

00:00:56.580  -->  00:01:03.180
Now if we zoom out a thousand times then we have a page of letters now a page of letters can have between

19

00:01:03.190  -->  00:01:05.380
two thousand five thousand letters.

20

00:01:05.430  -->  00:01:09.540
So we'll say that half a page of text is about right for one kilobyte.

21

00:01:09.540  -->  00:01:13.490
Now let's zoom out another thousand times and you'll get a book.

22

00:01:13.500  -->  00:01:18.570
So a book of about 500 pages that'll take up about a megabyte.

23

00:01:18.570  -->  00:01:20.790
Now let's zoom out another thousand times.

24

00:01:20.790  -->  00:01:30.660
And what we'll get is a gigabyte and a gigabyte is sufficient to fit the whole human genome so a human

25

00:01:30.660  -->  00:01:33.140
genome once it's coded it can fit into a gigabyte.

26

00:01:33.140  -->  00:01:39.270
In fact even seven hundred and fifty megabytes should be enough to fit that but it'll say gigabyte.

27

00:01:39.270  -->  00:01:43.800
So you can fit an entire person onto a gigabyte if you think of it that way.

28

00:01:44.070  -->  00:01:50.340
But here you'll say Well Carol actually the genome of a person is not sufficient to tell you everything

29

00:01:50.340  -->  00:01:56.010
about that person a person has you know life experiences a person if different people live their lives

30

00:01:56.040  -->  00:01:56.850
differently.

31

00:01:56.850  -->  00:02:00.620
And there's lots more to a person than just the genome.

32

00:02:00.750  -->  00:02:05.880
Well then let's zoom out another thousand times and we'll get to a terabyte.

33

00:02:06.060  -->  00:02:13.080
Well if you take an HD camera and you follow a person for every single day of their life for every single

34

00:02:13.320  -->  00:02:19.530
hour minute and second and you film everything that they're doing for 70 or 80 years you can fit all

35

00:02:19.530  -->  00:02:23.640
of that material onto one terabyte.

36

00:02:23.640  -->  00:02:24.330
How about that.

37

00:02:24.330  -->  00:02:26.100
That is pretty impressive already.

38

00:02:26.100  -->  00:02:32.670
So one terabyte can fit all of your life experiences filmed through your life for every single second

39

00:02:32.670  -->  00:02:34.050
that you live.

40

00:02:34.050  -->  00:02:38.120
Now let's zoom out another thousand times and we'll get to a terabyte.

41

00:02:38.460  -->  00:02:39.680
And for a terabyte.

42

00:02:39.690  -->  00:02:41.480
I've got one of my favorite examples.

43

00:02:41.490  -->  00:02:46.950
Here's the Amazon rain forest the Amazon rain forest takes up about 1.4 billion acres.

44

00:02:46.950  -->  00:02:49.520
That's one point four billion acres of trees.

45

00:02:49.740  -->  00:02:54.480
There's about 500 trees per acre making it about 700 billion trees.

46

00:02:54.480  -->  00:02:58.770
Now if you take all of these trees and you chop them down and you turn them into paper and you fill

47

00:02:58.800  -->  00:03:06.650
that paper with letters completely on both sides of the sheet then that will amount to somewhere between

48

00:03:06.670  -->  00:03:12.050
Want to Pedda bytes of data that is pretty impressive already for a terabyte.

49

00:03:12.060  -->  00:03:15.890
How much a pair of data is actually.

50

00:03:16.230  -->  00:03:22.800
Well now if you zoom out another thousand times you will get an exabyte and Exabyte is a thousand petabytes

51

00:03:23.520  -->  00:03:25.010
going back to our example.

52

00:03:25.020  -->  00:03:32.700
Since the dawn of time until 2005 humans had created 130 exabytes of data that is a lot of data and

53

00:03:32.700  -->  00:03:40.020
this includes everything includes and written and includes spoken includes full includes songs includes

54

00:03:40.440  -->  00:03:46.750
any kind of data ever produced by humans even all the words that they ever said.

55

00:03:46.860  -->  00:03:57.630
Now by 2010 this number had grown to 1000 200 exabytes of data so it nearly increased ten fold just

56

00:03:57.630  -->  00:03:59.670
over five years.

57

00:03:59.670  -->  00:04:05.840
Then in 2015 this Dahlia's estimated at seven thousand nine hundred exabytes of data.

58

00:04:06.420  -->  00:04:12.510
And finally by 2020 it's expected to be forty thousand nine hundred exabytes of data.

59

00:04:12.780  -->  00:04:19.020
So you can see that data in the world is growing very very quickly in fact is growing exponentially

60

00:04:19.040  -->  00:04:19.390
.

61

00:04:19.740  -->  00:04:23.780
We are creating much more data by the day.

62

00:04:23.970  -->  00:04:26.190
And if you visualize it it looks something like this.

63

00:04:26.190  -->  00:04:31.550
So this is the growth of data between 2010 and 2020.

64

00:04:31.560  -->  00:04:40.170
It's a 50 fold graph of data and the source for this report is ITC's Digital Universe sponsored by EMC

65

00:04:40.170  -->  00:04:40.590
.

66

00:04:40.590  -->  00:04:46.200
Now where is the opportunity for data scientists here why is it such a lucrative profession to be in

67

00:04:46.210  -->  00:04:46.370
.

68

00:04:46.530  -->  00:04:53.150
Well if you plot computers on this chart how computers are able to cope with the data.

69

00:04:53.310  -->  00:04:56.280
Then I would expect there'd be somewhere or would here.

70

00:04:56.280  -->  00:05:02.100
So that's how machines are able to store and process and do something with this data as you can see

71

00:05:02.100  -->  00:05:08.940
there's so much more data in the world that machine than machines can actually use and make sense of

72

00:05:09.000  -->  00:05:11.670
and adds value with.

73

00:05:12.030  -->  00:05:17.160
Well now if you plot the data scientists of the world they're actually over there way below the machines

74

00:05:17.170  -->  00:05:17.350
.

75

00:05:17.700  -->  00:05:22.890
They're from here you can see that there is a massive gap between the amount of data and how much data

76

00:05:22.890  -->  00:05:28.380
scientists can process and even between the amount of data that machines can process and derive value

77

00:05:28.380  -->  00:05:29.630
from a data scientists.

78

00:05:29.700  -->  00:05:33.230
And these gaps are actually just going to grow and grow and grow of time.

79

00:05:33.540  -->  00:05:38.070
And that is why there will be a huge growing demand for scientists in the future and we can really see

80

00:05:38.070  -->  00:05:44.190
that now we can already see how data scientists are becoming very popular salaries are going up and

81

00:05:44.190  -->  00:05:50.250
through the roof especially for very qualified data scientists who know what they're doing and can add

82

00:05:50.310  -->  00:05:53.310
value can do something with all of this data in the world.

83

00:05:53.880  -->  00:06:00.000
And in fact data science has already become a degree you can take different courses on our science and

84

00:06:00.000  -->  00:06:03.770
programs in universities like Berkeley and so on.

85

00:06:03.930  -->  00:06:09.330
And in fact you're actually taking one of these courses right now so you definitely already know that

86

00:06:09.330  -->  00:06:09.770
.

87

00:06:09.990  -->  00:06:12.780
And this is why our science is the place to be.

88

00:06:13.020  -->  00:06:14.590
Dora is going to grow in the world.

89

00:06:14.850  -->  00:06:16.200
Demand is going to grow.

90

00:06:16.230  -->  00:06:21.670
And they were always be a need for people who know what to do with their daughter.

91

00:06:21.810  -->  00:06:27.870
In fact we have time data science will become like and Norm it will become a norm just like everybody

92

00:06:27.870  -->  00:06:29.820
now has to know how to use an iPad.

93

00:06:29.910  -->  00:06:36.180
Everybody in 10 years time will be expected to know some level of data signs that they will be expected

94

00:06:36.180  -->  00:06:38.670
to apply in their role.

95

00:06:38.670  -->  00:06:39.330
There you have it.

96

00:06:39.330  -->  00:06:44.520
That is why data science is a great place to be and it's not going anywhere and you definitely did the

97

00:06:44.520  -->  00:06:49.890
right thing by enrolling in this course and you'll learn tons to help you be one of the top data scientists

98

00:06:50.090  -->  00:06:53.810
that is going to take advantage of those gaps that need to be filled.

99

00:06:54.120  -->  00:06:55.950
And I look forward to seeing our next tutorial.

100

00:06:55.950  -->  00:06:57.690
Until then happy analyzing
