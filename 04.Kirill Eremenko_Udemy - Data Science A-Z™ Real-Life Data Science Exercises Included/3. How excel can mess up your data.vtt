00:00:01.470  -->  00:00:04.410
Today I'll show you the dangers of dealing with Excel.

2

00:00:04.740  -->  00:00:09.850
As always let's copy the file from the original data folder into the prepared data folder.

3

00:00:09.870  -->  00:00:13.560
The safest way to explore your file is to open it with notepad plus plus.

4

00:00:13.590  -->  00:00:14.520
Let's do that.

5

00:00:14.820  -->  00:00:18.150
First off this is not a good way to display CSV files.

6

00:00:18.150  -->  00:00:20.850
We want one row of daughter per line.

7

00:00:20.850  -->  00:00:25.090
If your file is being displayed like this then you need to toggle word wrapping.

8

00:00:25.110  -->  00:00:27.320
Go to view and unchecked word wrap.

9

00:00:27.330  -->  00:00:28.930
Much better isn't it.

10

00:00:28.950  -->  00:00:31.970
You can see that there is lots of data in this file.

11

00:00:31.980  -->  00:00:38.250
In fact over 50000 rows you can already see some data issues over here at the bottom but we'll deal

12

00:00:38.250  -->  00:00:39.660
with them later.

13

00:00:39.660  -->  00:00:41.940
Right now I would like to show you something else.

14

00:00:41.940  -->  00:00:47.040
Scroll up to the top and scroll about halfway to the right.

15

00:00:47.040  -->  00:00:48.860
Pay attention to two things.

16

00:00:49.020  -->  00:00:55.050
Do you see that all the dates have slashes and are in American format from this record in row 3.

17

00:00:55.050  -->  00:00:58.620
You can tell that the month comes first then the day and then the year.

18

00:00:58.620  -->  00:01:00.560
Let's look at the first row again.

19

00:01:00.780  -->  00:01:04.700
Here you can see that the date is 11th August 1991.

20

00:01:04.770  -->  00:01:07.900
Let's remember that 11th of August.

21

00:01:07.920  -->  00:01:11.750
The second thing I'd like you to notice is that the data set has credit card numbers by the way.

22

00:01:11.760  -->  00:01:18.570
I want to reiterate that these are fake numbers but what you can see is that all 16 digits are displayed

23

00:01:18.600  -->  00:01:20.180
in this data.

24

00:01:20.180  -->  00:01:25.950
Now let's close the file open up Excel and drug UCSC into Excel.

25

00:01:26.070  -->  00:01:33.150
Now without doing anything simply save your file and open it up again in Notepad plus plus

26

00:01:37.320  -->  00:01:39.300
scroll to the right and look at your data.

27

00:01:39.300  -->  00:01:45.780
Now you can notice the dates in row 1 and 2 are presented with dots instead of slashes.

28

00:01:45.840  -->  00:01:50.060
But the funny thing is that the data in row 3 is still present with slashes.

29

00:01:50.070  -->  00:01:54.730
Note that this might not be the same for you because this effect depends on your computer settings.

30

00:01:54.780  -->  00:01:58.920
If that is the case then just follow along what's happening on my screen.

31

00:01:58.920  -->  00:02:00.660
So what happened here.

32

00:02:00.660  -->  00:02:05.850
Excel so Datto which it recognizes a date and it decided to convert it to a format that is convenient

33

00:02:05.850  -->  00:02:07.010
for me to read.

34

00:02:07.020  -->  00:02:09.200
How does excel know which format I prefer.

35

00:02:09.330  -->  00:02:14.340
Well it simply looked at my computer's regional settings and saw that I am used to the day month year

36

00:02:14.340  -->  00:02:21.630
format with DOS and not slushes So what it did is went and changed the data for me but it did it incorrectly

37

00:02:21.630  -->  00:02:21.900
.

38

00:02:21.990  -->  00:02:26.720
As you can see the data in the first row change from 11th August to 8th of November.

39

00:02:27.000  -->  00:02:31.410
Excel thought the dates were in European format and mistook the month for the day in the day for the

40

00:02:31.410  -->  00:02:32.340
month.

41

00:02:32.340  -->  00:02:36.090
This observation is backed by the fact that the third row has remained unchanged.

42

00:02:36.090  -->  00:02:39.190
The reason is that Excel does not recognize this record as a date.

43

00:02:39.270  -->  00:02:44.030
It was looking for a day month year and since there is no month with number 27.

44

00:02:44.030  -->  00:02:48.400
Excel decided that this is not a date and left the record as is.

45

00:02:48.620  -->  00:02:52.130
In short Excel completely messed up your dates.

46

00:02:52.140  -->  00:02:53.960
Now let's look at the credit card numbers.

47

00:02:53.970  -->  00:02:54.940
Where are they.

48

00:02:55.350  -->  00:02:57.030
They aren't here anymore.

49

00:02:57.150  -->  00:03:00.870
Excel has replaced them with a scientific number format.

50

00:03:00.870  -->  00:03:06.600
As you can see we haven't even started the process yet and have already caused ourselves additional

51

00:03:06.600  -->  00:03:07.620
problems.

52

00:03:07.620  -->  00:03:12.280
Plus while the date issue causes major headache it is still reversible.

53

00:03:12.390  -->  00:03:15.400
On the other hand the credit card screw up is not.

54

00:03:15.510  -->  00:03:19.350
You cannot retrieve the full 60 digits from this format.

55

00:03:19.350  -->  00:03:25.320
Imagine the consequences for an organization which loses its customers credit card numbers especially

56

00:03:25.320  -->  00:03:27.960
if this is the only copy of the file.

57

00:03:27.960  -->  00:03:33.540
This illustrates the importance of never touching your original data files even just opening them in

58

00:03:33.540  -->  00:03:35.880
Excel can mess them up.

59

00:03:35.880  -->  00:03:37.960
Now let's close this file and delete it.

60

00:03:37.980  -->  00:03:41.260
It's useless to us because the data has been jeopardized.

61

00:03:41.310  -->  00:03:44.830
Next time I will show you a bullet proof method for daughter raggedly
