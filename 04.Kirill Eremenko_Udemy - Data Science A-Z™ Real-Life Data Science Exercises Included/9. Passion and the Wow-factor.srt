10

00:00:33,840  -->  00:00:35,640
it in a room and presenting.

11

00:00:35,790  -->  00:00:39,690
Don't think about all the things that you must remember to say you must not forget to say these things

12

00:00:39,770  -->  00:00:40,020
.

You'll get lost in the detail and you won't have that effect.

14

00:00:42,990  -->  00:00:48,480
All you have to be thinking about when you're walking out there is how you're going to connect how you're

15

00:01:02,550  -->  00:01:05,230
And it does get contagious sometimes.

20

00:01:05,340  -->  00:01:06,960
So that is what you're aiming for.

21

00:01:06,960  -->  00:01:09,660
You should like it's data science.

We're doing this is we live in.

24

00:01:17,000  -->  00:01:17,660

26

Why not share our excitement and happiness with people and they will feel that way.

27

00:01:23,860  -->  00:01:29,430
If you are presenting like very dull and serious and all the facts and you know no jokes and just just

28

00:01:29,430  -->  00:01:33,180
straight to the facts like a lot of people can do that.

29

00:01:33,210  -->  00:01:34,370
Show them your passion.

30

00:01:34,410  -->  00:01:37,740
That is the most important is the best advice they can give you.

31

00:01:37,740  -->  00:01:41,690
Let your passion for science let it out.

32

00:01:41,820  -->  00:01:46,560
Give it to people and that's number one and number two the short one.

33

00:01:46,560  -->  00:01:49,670
Smile just smile when you're talking to people.

34

00:01:49,940  -->  00:01:53,610
It dissolves them and it just creates that connection.

35

00:01:53,620  -->  00:01:58,720
You've got to smile when you're presenting even if it's not a sense that aside is fun isn't it.
