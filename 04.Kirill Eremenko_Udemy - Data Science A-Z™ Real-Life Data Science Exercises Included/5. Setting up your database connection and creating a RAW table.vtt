00:00:00.780  -->  00:00:03.760
Now we will set up the database connection first of all.

2

00:00:03.780  -->  00:00:10.020
Let's open up a skill set or a management studio connect to the server you'll be using for this training

3

00:00:10.020  -->  00:00:11.010
.

4

00:00:11.010  -->  00:00:16.950
Now locate the database you'll be using as you recall previously in this course we created a test database

5

00:00:16.950  -->  00:00:18.160
called Diest training.

6

00:00:18.210  -->  00:00:20.910
I will be using it for this tutorial.

7

00:00:20.910  -->  00:00:23.340
My database currently has one table.

8

00:00:23.340  -->  00:00:25.990
This is the test table that we created earlier.

9

00:00:26.100  -->  00:00:32.280
At this stage what we will need is the server name right Donya server name somewhere and we will use

10

00:00:32.280  -->  00:00:33.990
it just now.

11

00:00:33.990  -->  00:00:38.270
Now let's return to Visual Studio and set up the database connection.

12

00:00:38.370  -->  00:00:41.480
DoubleClick though all the D-B destination.

13

00:00:41.490  -->  00:00:48.240
I can just like previously with the Flash file source manager we will need to create a new only DB connection

14

00:00:48.240  -->  00:00:53.130
manager which we can then use in this all the D-B destination.

15

00:00:53.370  -->  00:00:54.600
So click new.

16

00:00:54.660  -->  00:01:01.800
Now we need to connect to the server and the database click new again and type in the server name.

17

00:01:01.800  -->  00:01:03.020
Click refresh.

18

00:01:03.130  -->  00:01:06.300
And now from the dropdown select your database.

19

00:01:06.300  -->  00:01:12.350
Make sure your authentication method is correct throughout this course we are using Windows authentication

20

00:01:12.690  -->  00:01:17.750
and that is probably the one you need to unless your database administrator told you otherwise.

21

00:01:18.060  -->  00:01:24.810
Click OK and click OK again as you can see it is much quicker to set up and only D-B connection manager

22

00:01:24.840  -->  00:01:30.510
then a flat file well-sourced manager and the best part is that we can use this connection manager in

23

00:01:30.530  -->  00:01:38.220
our future only D-B destinations within this SS I-S project because we will be most likely using the

24

00:01:38.220  -->  00:01:41.790
same database to store our data.

25

00:01:41.940  -->  00:01:49.130
Now you can see the db connection manager here alongside the flat file source connection manager.

26

00:01:49.860  -->  00:01:53.310
So far we have connected to the server and the bar database.

27

00:01:53.400  -->  00:01:57.730
The last step is to create a table where the data will be placed.

28

00:01:57.750  -->  00:01:58.770
There are two options here.

29

00:01:58.830  -->  00:02:04.140
You can either create a table manually from within ask your server management studio or you can do it

30

00:02:04.200  -->  00:02:05.280
from Visual Studio.

31

00:02:05.280  -->  00:02:08.550
Getting Sosias to do most of the work for you.

32

00:02:08.550  -->  00:02:13.080
If you use the first method then after creating a table unless your Server Management Studio you can

33

00:02:13.080  -->  00:02:15.320
select to hear from the dropdown menu.

34

00:02:15.400  -->  00:02:20.350
However I recommend the second approach where we create the table through visual studio.

35

00:02:20.370  -->  00:02:27.780
It is more efficient and nicely fits into our e-tail blueprint to create the table click new as it says

36

00:02:27.780  -->  00:02:31.220
is smarter and has already prepared the code for you.

37

00:02:31.230  -->  00:02:35.780
The table that will be created will have the exact columns that you need.

38

00:02:36.060  -->  00:02:40.450
But how did his sisters know what columns you need and what size they should have.

39

00:02:40.470  -->  00:02:47.160
Well I knows this because of the blue arrow that connects your flat file source and the only D-B destination

40

00:02:48.000  -->  00:02:54.270
the blue arrow is telling Sosias that this table in the database will be used to store the data coming

41

00:02:54.270  -->  00:02:57.490
from that flat file source.

42

00:02:57.510  -->  00:03:01.020
Therefore SSA knows how the table should be structured.

43

00:03:01.050  -->  00:03:07.260
This can be very handy and save you lots of time when you're dealing with large tables with hundreds

44

00:03:07.260  -->  00:03:08.940
of columns.

45

00:03:08.940  -->  00:03:11.360
Let's go back to our table creation menu.

46

00:03:11.850  -->  00:03:13.950
As you can see everything is nearly ready.

47

00:03:13.950  -->  00:03:16.860
We just need to make a few small changes.

48

00:03:16.860  -->  00:03:19.460
First of all let's change the name of our table.

49

00:03:19.620  -->  00:03:21.750
I will demonstrate a convention that I use.

50

00:03:21.870  -->  00:03:23.990
Start the table name of role.

51

00:03:24.150  -->  00:03:30.210
This will tell you whoever is viewing the database that this table contains raw data for your analysis

52

00:03:30.210  -->  00:03:30.670
.

53

00:03:30.840  -->  00:03:36.630
Then put an underscore to separate the core of the tables name here type in the table name prefer Blee

54

00:03:37.080  -->  00:03:42.120
without any spaces or hyphens to separate words or simply capitalize them.

55

00:03:42.120  -->  00:03:45.280
For us it's bank customer demo.

56

00:03:45.760  -->  00:03:51.930
Now put another underscore and enter today's date in the form at which you should be getting used to

57

00:03:51.930  -->  00:03:54.540
by year month day.

58

00:03:54.540  -->  00:04:00.120
Let me pause here for a second to explain why appending a date to your tables to your raw tables is

59

00:04:00.120  -->  00:04:01.190
so important.

60

00:04:01.200  -->  00:04:03.430
There are a couple of reasons.

61

00:04:03.510  -->  00:04:04.770
One is versioning.

62

00:04:04.770  -->  00:04:09.760
If your analysis ever needs to be refreshed with new data then it'll be very easy to distinguish between

63

00:04:09.780  -->  00:04:14.180
all the new data sets because the table names have dates.

64

00:04:14.190  -->  00:04:16.340
Another major reason is auditing.

65

00:04:16.410  -->  00:04:21.930
Through this date you will always know in which subfolder of the uploaded data folder.

66

00:04:22.020  -->  00:04:25.250
The matching says the file is sitting.

67

00:04:25.260  -->  00:04:30.160
This is important because it allows you to trace any errors back to the source.

68

00:04:30.810  -->  00:04:32.350
Back to the table creation.

69

00:04:32.460  -->  00:04:34.080
We are nearly finished here.

70

00:04:34.080  -->  00:04:35.830
Just one more thing we need to add.

71

00:04:35.830  -->  00:04:38.510
It's an extra column full of me and after.

72

00:04:38.510  -->  00:04:44.400
I will explain what this means in square brackets type in row number as one word.

73

00:04:44.400  -->  00:04:51.930
This is going to be the column name and after that type in the following row of text int identity left

74

00:04:51.930  -->  00:04:58.070
bracket one comma one right bracket and finish off throve a comma.

75

00:04:58.080  -->  00:05:03.840
The code that you have just added will insert a row number column at the start of your table.

76

00:05:03.840  -->  00:05:07.800
Make sure to do this for every table you create where SOSIAS.

77

00:05:07.830  -->  00:05:11.640
This helps if indexation especially with large data sets.

78

00:05:11.640  -->  00:05:18.270
Basically what this means is that they become more efficient and they take up less space.

79

00:05:18.270  -->  00:05:22.020
Your database administrator will thank you for it.

80

00:05:22.020  -->  00:05:24.480
By the way we won't be covering schemas in this course.

81

00:05:24.480  -->  00:05:30.270
However if you are restricted to working with a certain schema in your database then you should add

82

00:05:30.270  -->  00:05:34.030
your schema name before the table name like this.

83

00:05:34.050  -->  00:05:40.560
Simply put it in square brackets followed by a dot but I'll delete this now because we won't be needing

84

00:05:40.560  -->  00:05:42.060
it.

85

00:05:42.510  -->  00:05:43.790
Now we're going to click OK.

86

00:05:43.800  -->  00:05:45.000
However before we do that.

87

00:05:45.000  -->  00:05:50.900
Note that as soon as you click OK Sosias will create your table for you.

88

00:05:51.090  -->  00:05:51.720
All right.

89

00:05:51.720  -->  00:05:54.170
Now let's go have a look at our table.

90

00:05:54.210  -->  00:05:58.520
Right click on the tables folder and hit refresh.

91

00:05:58.620  -->  00:06:00.190
Here you can see the new table.

92

00:06:00.450  -->  00:06:06.480
Right click it and choose select top 1000 rows to get a preview of what is inside.

93

00:06:06.690  -->  00:06:12.300
The tables are empty but it has the right columns prepared including the number column which we just

94

00:06:12.330  -->  00:06:13.100
added.

95

00:06:13.530  -->  00:06:18.270
Let's go back to society and finalize the only D-B destination.

96

00:06:18.270  -->  00:06:23.390
Here you can see that the newly created table has been selected for us in the dropdown.

97

00:06:23.400  -->  00:06:25.610
Don't worry about the rest of the options on the screen.

98

00:06:25.620  -->  00:06:27.570
We won't be needing them at the bottom.

99

00:06:27.570  -->  00:06:29.180
You see a warning message.

100

00:06:29.190  -->  00:06:31.110
It is asking us to map the columns.

101

00:06:31.110  -->  00:06:35.520
Let's go ahead and do that by clicking on the mappings page.

102

00:06:35.760  -->  00:06:38.940
If you follow the steps carefully then you won't have to do anything on this page.

103

00:06:38.940  -->  00:06:42.440
The columns are already mapped for you.

104

00:06:42.570  -->  00:06:44.070
Now you can click OK.

105

00:06:44.340  -->  00:06:48.090
You're only DBI destination is ready on my screen.

106

00:06:48.090  -->  00:06:50.530
You can see that the Red Arrows sign is still there.

107

00:06:50.610  -->  00:06:53.070
If I hover over it you'll see more details.

108

00:06:53.070  -->  00:06:57.390
It says the column custom ID cannot be processed because more than one code.

109

00:06:57.390  -->  00:07:01.200
Page 1 2 5 2 and 1 2 5 1 are specified.

110

00:07:01.620  -->  00:07:04.210
You should not have this error on your machine.

111

00:07:04.260  -->  00:07:10.470
All it is saying is that Sosias is confused as to which code page should be used to upload text data

112

00:07:10.470  -->  00:07:11.480
to the database.

113

00:07:11.730  -->  00:07:15.740
This is simply because I have installed multiple languages on my machine.

114

00:07:15.750  -->  00:07:17.290
English and Russian.

115

00:07:17.370  -->  00:07:21.860
If you do encounter this error all you have to do is select the only DBI destination and in the properties

116

00:07:21.860  -->  00:07:26.990
when on the right set always use default code page to true.

117

00:07:27.090  -->  00:07:31.350
As soon as I do that the error changes into a warning and it really shouldn't bother us because we know

118

00:07:31.350  -->  00:07:32.630
what it's all about.

119

00:07:33.450  -->  00:07:35.530
And that brings us to the end of today's tutorial.

120

00:07:35.670  -->  00:07:39.780
Hope you're doing well so far and learning lots of new stuff.

121

00:07:39.780  -->  00:07:41.820
Next time we will run the upload process
