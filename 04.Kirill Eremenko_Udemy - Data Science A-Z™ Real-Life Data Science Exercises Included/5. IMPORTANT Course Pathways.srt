1

00:00:00,410  -->  00:00:06,510
Or write course pathways exciting tutorial ahead as you will see this course consists of four major

2

00:00:06,510  -->  00:00:13,160
parts results for data mining modeling daughter prep and communication and presentation.

3

00:00:13,410  -->  00:00:18,720
And you can combine these molecules into your own learning program.

4

00:00:18,720  -->  00:00:24,120
The thing is that this course has over 200 lectures and over 20 hours of content and of course it's

5

00:00:24,120  -->  00:00:26,110
very beneficial to go through everything.

6

00:00:26,280  -->  00:00:31,920
However you might want to go through it in different order or something might be an urgent requirement

7

00:00:31,920  -->  00:00:33,990
for you right now and you want to address that.

8

00:00:34,020  -->  00:00:39,900
So let's have a look at some of the template pathways that you can create using these building blocks

9

00:00:39,900  -->  00:00:40,860
.

10

00:00:40,860  -->  00:00:43,310
We're going to put the pathways on the right over here.

11

00:00:43,560  -->  00:00:49,410
And the first and most obvious pathway is the independent one where you can take any of these modules

12

00:00:49,770  -->  00:00:55,200
by itself and the course is structured in such a way that these modules are completely independent so

13

00:00:55,530  -->  00:01:01,260
you don't have to worry about missing out on some lectures that might be required in the model that

14

00:01:01,260  -->  00:01:02,310
you're taking.

15

00:01:02,310  -->  00:01:08,340
You can simply start the module and you will safely get to the end without having to worry about a thing

16

00:01:08,340  -->  00:01:08,870
.

17

00:01:08,880  -->  00:01:15,370
So if you have a pressing need to get into one of these topics right away Feel free to do that.

18

00:01:15,510  -->  00:01:20,340
You will be able to get to the knowledge you need very quickly.

19

00:01:20,460  -->  00:01:22,400
Number two the full monty.

20

00:01:22,560  -->  00:01:28,080
You just basically go through those full course as it's laid out and you'll go from visualization for

21

00:01:28,080  -->  00:01:32,210
data mining to modeling to data prep to communication presentation.

22

00:01:32,220  -->  00:01:38,010
Now the Course is structured in exactly this way because this is the most fun and engaging way to discover

23

00:01:38,010  -->  00:01:39,950
these topics.

24

00:01:39,960  -->  00:01:48,180
Option 3 is the sequential option where you take these modules in the sequence that they would come

25

00:01:48,240  -->  00:01:54,180
in a data science project so you basically start of data prep then you move onto his position for data

26

00:01:54,180  -->  00:01:57,750
mining then to modeling then to communication presentation.

27

00:01:57,750  -->  00:02:02,280
Now I had the idea of putting data prep at the very start of the course but I realized that this is

28

00:02:02,280  -->  00:02:07,320
the most tedious task and it does take the longest in any given day Innocence Project.

29

00:02:07,320  -->  00:02:13,650
So it would be a major turnoff to put it at the start of the course because it's not the most fun part

30

00:02:13,650  -->  00:02:14,640
of data science.

31

00:02:14,640  -->  00:02:21,120
So therefore we first go through viz. and then through modeling and then we go to Dapra when we already

32

00:02:21,120  -->  00:02:27,150
know what why we're sacrificing so much time what the end result of our data prep will be.

33

00:02:27,150  -->  00:02:33,270
However having said that if you feel that you would like to sort of data prep please feel free and go

34

00:02:33,270  -->  00:02:34,460
ahead and do that.

35

00:02:34,470  -->  00:02:38,280
Just be warned that data prep will take quite a long time.

36

00:02:38,280  -->  00:02:41,660
It's the biggest module of this course.

37

00:02:41,790  -->  00:02:50,040
Number for the Explorer here you start viz. for data mining and then you proceed directly to communication

38

00:02:50,040  -->  00:02:51,450
and presentation.

39

00:02:51,450  -->  00:02:56,640
The prerequisite here is that you have to be sure that Eudora is clean and it's ready to be analyzed

40

00:02:57,000  -->  00:03:01,310
and also through this pathway you won't be creating any models or forecasts.

41

00:03:01,410  -->  00:03:07,620
So basically you'll be skipping the part where you create a long term solution for the problem that

42

00:03:07,620  -->  00:03:08,600
you've identified.

43

00:03:08,600  -->  00:03:13,880
Nevertheless these insights will be very agile and you'll be able to communicate them properly to the

44

00:03:14,250  -->  00:03:18,400
key decision makers and take it from there.

45

00:03:18,510  -->  00:03:20,570
Partho m. 5 is called the modeler.

46

00:03:20,670  -->  00:03:29,820
So this pathway is for people who are tasked in their daily jobs to create models and deploy them.

47

00:03:29,820  -->  00:03:35,340
So once you already have knowledge of what goes into the model for instance you might be working a bank

48

00:03:35,340  -->  00:03:38,610
and you're in know how your credit scoring model works.

49

00:03:38,640  -->  00:03:44,340
So all you need to do is prepare the data load into a database and then build the model for that credit

50

00:03:44,340  -->  00:03:47,580
scoring system so you don't need to do any investigations.

51

00:03:47,580  -->  00:03:49,350
You don't need to communicate it later on.

52

00:03:49,440  -->  00:03:55,620
You just need to build it and deploy it and then maintain it assess it and see how it goes in a year

53

00:03:55,620  -->  00:03:57,380
or so and deploy the next one and so on.

54

00:03:57,570  -->  00:04:02,610
And that's that is quite a frequent type of role.

55

00:04:02,700  -->  00:04:06,540
And this might be very useful to some people.

56

00:04:06,540  -->  00:04:08,990
Number six the senior.

57

00:04:09,060  -->  00:04:15,180
So here I mean senior data scientist and basically these are the lucky people that have somebody else

58

00:04:15,180  -->  00:04:16,820
doing their data prep for them.

59

00:04:16,950  -->  00:04:19,400
And of course you have to trust these people and rely on them.

60

00:04:19,440  -->  00:04:24,000
But if you're sure that your daughter prep has been done and your daughter is clean then you can totally

61

00:04:24,000  -->  00:04:29,610
skip the data prep part and just do the fun bits which is the visualization for data mining modeling

62

00:04:29,700  -->  00:04:31,880
and communication and presentation.

63

00:04:32,580  -->  00:04:36,030
And finally number seven reporting services.

64

00:04:36,150  -->  00:04:41,580
So I've done quite a lot of work of reporting services or business intelligence units of organizations

65

00:04:41,970  -->  00:04:48,000
and I've seen what the work they do and it really fits in well with what we discuss in these two parts

66

00:04:48,000  -->  00:04:48,320
.

67

00:04:48,330  -->  00:04:54,750
So if you in your role are the data custodian in the organization or you work closely with the data

68

00:04:54,750  -->  00:05:03,540
custodian you find yourself creating reports and preparing the data to be stored in warehouses and working

69

00:05:03,810  -->  00:05:08,450
with sequel and Microsoft Visual Studio and essays and things like that.

70

00:05:08,610  -->  00:05:13,800
Then you might be interested in this pathway because here we totally talk exactly about that how to

71

00:05:13,800  -->  00:05:19,020
store the data how to clean and how to prepare it and also then you can move on straight to the communication

72

00:05:19,020  -->  00:05:19,050
.

73

00:05:19,050  -->  00:05:27,390
So basically this pathway doesn't imply any kind of analysis or data mining or modeling is just getting

74

00:05:27,390  -->  00:05:32,490
the data putting it into the right place and then presenting it to the right people.

75

00:05:32,760  -->  00:05:35,590
So those are the pathways for this course.

76

00:05:35,730  -->  00:05:38,190
Once again this is not an exhaustive list.

77

00:05:38,190  -->  00:05:45,180
You can come up with your own totally unique pathway that will suit your needs but otherwise I hope

78

00:05:45,180  -->  00:05:46,010
you enjoy the course.

79

00:05:46,050  -->  00:05:49,360
And I look forward to seeing you within these modules.

80

00:05:49,490  -->  00:05:51,390
And until next time happy analyzing
