00:00:00,450  -->  00:00:06,480
In this tutorial we will talk about folder structure for your Dotson's project and I will show you the

2

00:00:06,480  -->  00:00:12,180
tried and tested method that I use folder structure is important for many reasons.

3

00:00:12,180  -->  00:00:17,430
For instance if you have a smartphone a structure then you will know exactly where things are located

4

00:00:17,730  -->  00:00:19,850
and your efficiency will go up.

5

00:00:19,890  -->  00:00:25,370
Also good for the structure will allow you to quickly audit any data errors that you might find.

6

00:00:25,710  -->  00:00:29,260
Let's assume that this is your folder for Alderson's project.

7

00:00:29,280  -->  00:00:30,640
Let's open it up.

8

00:00:30,690  -->  00:00:34,110
Inside you will see that I have already created a template.

9

00:00:34,110  -->  00:00:36,150
Ignore the exclamation mark at the start.

10

00:00:36,180  -->  00:00:41,230
It's there simply so that the template is always at the top of the folder.

11

00:00:41,220  -->  00:00:46,530
You'll notice that the name of the template folder starts with a date in a specific format and then

12

00:00:46,530  -->  00:00:50,120
the project name the date is when you commence this project.

13

00:00:50,250  -->  00:00:52,900
Once the date is set it can be changed.

14

00:00:52,950  -->  00:00:58,230
Not that it is important to set the date in this exact format because in that way your folders will

15

00:00:58,320  -->  00:01:02,470
automatically sorted by chronological order when you sort them by name.

16

00:01:02,940  -->  00:01:04,850
Let's click into the template.

17

00:01:04,890  -->  00:01:11,370
Inside you will see the following six folders original data prepared data uploaded daughter analysis

18

00:01:11,400  -->  00:01:14,890
insights and final Let's go through them one by one.

19

00:01:14,940  -->  00:01:18,930
The first folder is for storing data extracted from other systems.

20

00:01:18,960  -->  00:01:24,660
You can only add data to this folder and you should never under no circumstances modify any data stored

21

00:01:24,690  -->  00:01:26,610
in this folder.

22

00:01:26,610  -->  00:01:31,800
The second folder is for any modifications you may make to the raw data.

23

00:01:31,800  -->  00:01:38,160
This includes cleaning the data which will look at further in the course folder 3 is for uploading data

24

00:01:38,160  -->  00:01:38,280
.

25

00:01:38,280  -->  00:01:41,250
Think of it as the temporary stop for your data.

26

00:01:41,430  -->  00:01:47,400
Once you are ready to upload a file inside this folder you create a subfolder with just the date of

27

00:01:47,400  -->  00:01:52,830
the upload for the name and from within that folder you upload the data.

28

00:01:52,860  -->  00:01:55,960
We will see all of this in action in the next section.

29

00:01:56,300  -->  00:02:03,450
The analysis folder is for any code scripts etc that you create during the course of your analysis and

30

00:02:03,450  -->  00:02:07,260
the insights folder is for any preliminary results.

31

00:02:07,260  -->  00:02:12,020
Finally the final folder stores your draft and file reports.

32

00:02:12,360  -->  00:02:14,310
This brings us to the end of today's tutorial.

33

00:02:14,310  -->  00:02:19,740
Feel free to copy this for the structure template as we will start using it already in the next tutorial

34

00:02:19,750  -->  00:02:20,280
