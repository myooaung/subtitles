00:00:00.330  -->  00:00:05.910
Hello and welcome back in the previous tutorial we talked in theory about the cumulative accuracy profile

2

00:00:05.910  -->  00:00:06.250
.

3

00:00:06.270  -->  00:00:08.460
Today we're actually going to practice it.

4

00:00:08.460  -->  00:00:13.920
We're going to build our first cap curve for our model is going to be an exciting tutorial and you will

5

00:00:13.920  -->  00:00:20.070
learn a very important technique that you'll be able to take away and apply in your future work as a

6

00:00:20.070  -->  00:00:21.300
data scientist.

7

00:00:21.330  -->  00:00:24.810
The cap curve is important because it allows you to access models.

8

00:00:24.810  -->  00:00:28.130
It allows you to compare models side by side and choose the best one.

9

00:00:28.350  -->  00:00:32.250
And it also allows you to assess how models deteriorate over time.

10

00:00:32.250  -->  00:00:36.820
All those three are very important elements of the work of a data scientist.

11

00:00:37.020  -->  00:00:38.190
So let's get straight into it.

12

00:00:38.190  -->  00:00:39.480
I've got the data set.

13

00:00:39.480  -->  00:00:45.420
Load it up into Grettel here and I've already created the dummy variables and I've created the derived

14

00:00:46.020  -->  00:00:48.590
log of balance variable.

15

00:00:48.660  -->  00:00:56.760
So actually transformation of ballads and I've actually even prepared the model according to the file

16

00:00:56.760  -->  00:01:02.880
that we've saved so I totally understand that this is not the best way to save models in a text file

17

00:01:03.370  -->  00:01:03.910
.

18

00:01:03.990  -->  00:01:08.610
And tools like other tools like our SPSS SAS and so on they'll definitely allow you to save your model

19

00:01:08.610  -->  00:01:13.320
for future use and I'm sure there's a way to do an Grettel I'm just more familiar with this approach

20

00:01:13.340  -->  00:01:13.500
.

21

00:01:13.650  -->  00:01:21.840
So what we've done here is just basically copied the regressors the same ones that we had in our model

22

00:01:21.840  -->  00:01:26.880
previously we have copied them into the new model that we're going to run just now and I'm going to

23

00:01:26.970  -->  00:01:28.130
run this.

24

00:01:28.890  -->  00:01:37.200
And here you can see is the coefficients we just have to check that they're the same so just check some

25

00:01:37.200  -->  00:01:38.380
random ones.

26

00:01:38.790  -->  00:01:40.680
And then the r squared.

27

00:01:40.680  -->  00:01:41.880
So basically everything is the same.

28

00:01:41.880  -->  00:01:42.240
Good.

29

00:01:42.240  -->  00:01:43.680
We can close this file now.

30

00:01:44.040  -->  00:01:45.200
So the models run.

31

00:01:45.480  -->  00:01:49.650
And now what we need is the prediction we want the probabilities.

32

00:01:49.650  -->  00:01:55.800
So we can build the cap curve in order to get probabilities we we're going to go to analysis for costs

33

00:01:55.840  -->  00:01:56.220
.

34

00:01:56.340  -->  00:01:59.650
We're going to forecast anything we're just running in for the same data.

35

00:01:59.940  -->  00:02:01.230
And there it is.

36

00:02:01.560  -->  00:02:04.810
So that's our exited the actual value of the prediction.

37

00:02:04.980  -->  00:02:12.180
We're going to save this value so the prediction by default it selects the exited hats its name but

38

00:02:12.450  -->  00:02:20.780
that's not exactly correct the correct name is years be had because it's a probability and forwork the

39

00:02:20.790  -->  00:02:26.800
descriptions for cost of exited probability to be completely correct.

40

00:02:26.800  -->  00:02:27.720
Okay.

41

00:02:27.990  -->  00:02:29.330
And we can close that.

42

00:02:29.370  -->  00:02:30.970
We'll leave the model for now.

43

00:02:31.290  -->  00:02:37.170
So here we've got to be had variable and now we want to export it so we'll go to file export data.

44

00:02:37.260  -->  00:02:43.990
We want Roe number there we want exited and we want p hat and that's all we want.

45

00:02:44.340  -->  00:02:45.980
Okay okay.

46

00:02:46.050  -->  00:02:48.810
Now select the folder I'm going to go to All right.

47

00:02:48.810  -->  00:02:55.000
My daughter I'm just going to call it churn modeling for cost save.

48

00:02:55.230  -->  00:02:55.630
OK.

49

00:02:55.650  -->  00:03:00.060
Now we can move away from Grettel and go here.

50

00:03:00.060  -->  00:03:05.130
So there it is generally for cost and not going to bring up Excel and this is where the fund will start

51

00:03:05.140  -->  00:03:05.650
.

52

00:03:06.150  -->  00:03:06.920
Okay.

53

00:03:06.960  -->  00:03:10.240
So we're keeping on rolling into here.

54

00:03:10.710  -->  00:03:11.660
I'm going to zoom in.

55

00:03:11.700  -->  00:03:17.460
First thing that we want to do is right away save it as an excellent X so we don't lose anything like

56

00:03:17.460  -->  00:03:20.150
colors and stuff like that that we're going to be adding.

57

00:03:20.160  -->  00:03:20.460
All right.

58

00:03:20.460  -->  00:03:21.150
Good.

59

00:03:21.210  -->  00:03:25.040
Second thing second most important thing is like I put the filters on.

60

00:03:25.170  -->  00:03:31.520
Now we want to filter by p hat and we were sold by largest to smallest take the filters off.

61

00:03:31.680  -->  00:03:33.220
So why did we do that.

62

00:03:33.240  -->  00:03:37.680
Well because remember that scenario and I'm going to bring up this image because we've been using it

63

00:03:37.680  -->  00:03:46.260
quite a lot remember here what we did is we said for the cap curve and just logically if we have a model

64

00:03:46.260  -->  00:03:53.100
that tells us that these people these people are the most likely to take up the offer because look at

65

00:03:53.100  -->  00:03:58.080
the probability 93 percent chance 92 percent chance if they're the most likely to take up the offer

66

00:03:58.080  -->  00:04:02.500
then we should contact them first so this is as over here in the first batch.

67

00:04:02.530  -->  00:04:08.050
We're going to have the most likely people and as we get further away the likelihood is going to decrease

68

00:04:08.060  -->  00:04:08.080
.

69

00:04:08.100  -->  00:04:10.430
But we want to get the bang for the buck.

70

00:04:10.440  -->  00:04:16.080
So we want to make sure that we reach out to the people that are most interested in this offer.

71

00:04:16.140  -->  00:04:24.450
By the way this is not just a like business focused very mercantile approach that we don't care about

72

00:04:24.450  -->  00:04:25.140
people's feelings.

73

00:04:25.140  -->  00:04:26.710
No in reality.

74

00:04:26.730  -->  00:04:31.650
Like why would you want to reach out to people who don't care about your product or who have other better

75

00:04:31.650  -->  00:04:32.100
things to do.

76

00:04:32.100  -->  00:04:37.150
You want to get to the people who want your product so you're also taking care of the customer it's

77

00:04:37.150  -->  00:04:38.990
a it's a win win for everybody.

78

00:04:39.000  -->  00:04:42.560
So here that's why we've ordered it by probability.

79

00:04:42.570  -->  00:04:45.170
We want to get to these people first.

80

00:04:45.210  -->  00:04:50.590
They are the most likely to take up our offer and they are the most interested in that offer.

81

00:04:51.120  -->  00:04:57.240
So once again where we're trying to create this right now this this is random this and we know how to

82

00:04:57.240  -->  00:04:57.920
do it.

83

00:04:57.940  -->  00:04:59.390
Anybody can do that.

84

00:04:59.400  -->  00:04:59.910
OK.

85

00:05:00.120  -->  00:05:05.580
So let's add some rose then here I'm just going to put stats because we're going to type in some stats

86

00:05:05.580  -->  00:05:06.050
.

87

00:05:06.090  -->  00:05:09.900
First thing we want is we want total exited.

88

00:05:10.140  -->  00:05:17.340
So I want to count how many people exited in total is going to be the sum right of this column over

89

00:05:17.340  -->  00:05:21.020
here or basically of all the ones in this call.

90

00:05:21.150  -->  00:05:32.080
So if I just do some Then I get 2037 people left the bank then total records the school records this

91

00:05:32.080  -->  00:05:34.670
one let's make some space.

92

00:05:34.780  -->  00:05:36.550
This one is going to be count.

93

00:05:36.880  -->  00:05:43.750
And you can count exited or you can count the number of rows so let's count the number of rows and then

94

00:05:44.200  -->  00:05:46.080
we're going to have an exit ratio.

95

00:05:46.330  -->  00:05:52.540
So that is all going back to the Kepcher just now so total exit a divide we're told number records and

96

00:05:52.570  -->  00:05:54.190
I'm going back to the cap curve.

97

00:05:54.220  -->  00:05:56.550
Where is it.

98

00:05:56.650  -->  00:06:04.260
There is so total total exit ratio here 20 percent is remember that 10 percent that we're talking about

99

00:06:04.270  -->  00:06:10.150
in the cap curve that the total number of people that will ever take your offer or in this case the

100

00:06:10.150  -->  00:06:16.210
total of people that will ever leave the bank is 20 percent or that time there was 10 percent.

101

00:06:16.210  -->  00:06:22.030
So here we are going to change this to a percentage so it looks better.

102

00:06:22.840  -->  00:06:25.340
Okay good.

103

00:06:25.870  -->  00:06:27.120
That's that part done.

104

00:06:27.130  -->  00:06:29.780
Now what we want is a few extra columns right.

105

00:06:30.040  -->  00:06:32.000
Maybe let's take out one room.

106

00:06:32.140  -->  00:06:36.060
We'll start off a call for just total select total select.

107

00:06:36.220  -->  00:06:45.070
So if I select people one by one this column will tell me how much I'm selecting So 1 2 3 and so on

108

00:06:45.070  -->  00:06:45.100
.

109

00:06:45.100  -->  00:06:49.940
So if I continue this down as you can see just telling me how many how I selected.

110

00:06:49.960  -->  00:06:54.970
So far if I'm selecting from the top to the bottom I like the 10 of us like to the level of like the

111

00:06:54.970  -->  00:06:55.840
12 and so on.

112

00:06:56.020  -->  00:07:04.300
So here we want a percentage total select percent once this divided by the total records.

113

00:07:04.300  -->  00:07:06.430
Don't forget to press a forward to look at him.

114

00:07:06.720  -->  00:07:07.310
OK.

115

00:07:07.440  -->  00:07:11.330
Let's save it there so as you can see it goes up to 100 percent right.

116

00:07:11.420  -->  00:07:15.200
That that should make total sense total select toll's like percent.

117

00:07:15.230  -->  00:07:16.330
Next we want to.

118

00:07:16.420  -->  00:07:21.550
Well let's call these two columns in a nice soft gray.

119

00:07:22.570  -->  00:07:23.630
OK.

120

00:07:24.370  -->  00:07:25.240
There we go.

121

00:07:25.240  -->  00:07:30.580
The next one is what if we select a random So right now what we want to do is want to build this blue

122

00:07:30.580  -->  00:07:31.270
line.

123

00:07:31.270  -->  00:07:32.170
How can we built this.

124

00:07:32.200  -->  00:07:41.130
Well let's start selecting at random random select right by the way you can copy what I'm doing.

125

00:07:41.210  -->  00:07:46.990
It's a good exercise but I will also give you this template in the next Tauriel I think.

126

00:07:46.990  -->  00:07:52.900
So you'll get this template so don't worry if you're not following what I'm doing on your computer.

127

00:07:52.990  -->  00:07:55.900
Random select what do we want to do.

128

00:07:55.900  -->  00:07:57.130
We want to select at random.

129

00:07:57.130  -->  00:08:03.480
So we're saying this is a number of people that we've selected So if say we select a random 10 people

130

00:08:03.480  -->  00:08:04.780
random five people.

131

00:08:04.780  -->  00:08:12.450
How many of them are going to exit what's like statistically is going to be five times right.

132

00:08:12.490  -->  00:08:15.140
The exit ratio and the exit ratio in.

133

00:08:15.370  -->  00:08:17.870
So we can copy this call there.

134

00:08:18.150  -->  00:08:18.620
Right.

135

00:08:18.640  -->  00:08:21.340
And go to the bottom go to the Topkapi.

136

00:08:21.520  -->  00:08:28.960
And so you can see that 10 people so two will exit if we select if we select 50 people 10 will exit

137

00:08:28.960  -->  00:08:34.130
if we select 100 people 20 will X it should make sense right at the bottom.

138

00:08:34.130  -->  00:08:39.580
Here we have two thousand and three sound because we've got to 100 percent we've selected all of them

139

00:08:39.580  -->  00:08:39.630
.

140

00:08:39.640  -->  00:08:48.610
And so twenty point thirty seven percent have exited a random select and let's do random will random

141

00:08:49.300  -->  00:08:51.690
select percent.

142

00:08:52.090  -->  00:09:00.810
Right so this one is going to be just how many we selected divided by the total number of exited.

143

00:09:00.820  -->  00:09:03.310
Once again we need to lock it in by pressing a 4.

144

00:09:03.310  -->  00:09:07.870
So as you can see is going to come up here like that.

145

00:09:07.870  -->  00:09:09.050
We get to 100 percent.

146

00:09:09.190  -->  00:09:15.370
So let's just go over this one more time random select is out of the people we've selected So if we

147

00:09:15.370  -->  00:09:20.010
select this number of people how many are statistically going to exit.

148

00:09:20.350  -->  00:09:25.450
If we select 100 people how many statistically are going to exit and then random select percent is the

149

00:09:25.450  -->  00:09:27.800
percentage of the total.

150

00:09:27.820  -->  00:09:31.170
So I'm going to call this in a light blue.

151

00:09:31.620  -->  00:09:38.770
And why am I colluding in the blue because the color of this line is blue and that's basically what

152

00:09:38.770  -->  00:09:42.610
we constructed we're saying as we select more people.

153

00:09:42.610  -->  00:09:44.490
Right.

154

00:09:44.500  -->  00:09:53.470
So these gray over here let's move somewhere lower where there is you know whole numbers or even higher

155

00:09:53.470  -->  00:09:53.920
.

156

00:09:53.920  -->  00:09:55.210
There we go somewhere.

157

00:09:55.390  -->  00:09:58.450
Somewhere here I guess.

158

00:09:58.450  -->  00:10:06.370
So this this line this number over here is the bottom line over here or in percentage terms that's the

159

00:10:06.370  -->  00:10:09.820
percentage of 33 percent that's how many we've selected.

160

00:10:09.910  -->  00:10:15.090
And the blue is how many of them actually in this case purchased in our case exit.

161

00:10:15.100  -->  00:10:21.040
So if we select thirty three point seventy four people percent then obviously thirty three point seventy

162

00:10:21.040  -->  00:10:26.380
four of the people that will actually eventually exit will be selected as well because it's a random

163

00:10:26.380  -->  00:10:27.200
selection.

164

00:10:27.220  -->  00:10:30.280
So this number will always be equal to that number.

165

00:10:30.580  -->  00:10:31.810
A random select.

166

00:10:31.840  -->  00:10:35.550
And finally we want to model select.

167

00:10:36.040  -->  00:10:41.430
So if we're ordering by probability how many are we actually getting.

168

00:10:41.440  -->  00:10:44.400
How many of the Xers or turners are we kidding.

169

00:10:44.740  -->  00:10:47.470
Well we need to look at this called exited.

170

00:10:47.950  -->  00:10:51.670
And here we need to add this value.

171

00:10:51.670  -->  00:10:56.410
So I'm just going to copy and as you can see let's go through this a bit.

172

00:10:56.470  -->  00:11:02.100
So if we select 10 people we're going to hit 7 chanters right.

173

00:11:02.410  -->  00:11:05.980
If we're going to you're going to if we select 20 people we're going to hit 14 turners.

174

00:11:06.130  -->  00:11:08.400
And the way you can see it from here is that.

175

00:11:08.520  -->  00:11:10.420
So this person didn't actually leave.

176

00:11:10.690  -->  00:11:14.460
And according to a model we did need to select them so all model made a mistake there.

177

00:11:14.470  -->  00:11:15.940
It's not the best person.

178

00:11:15.970  -->  00:11:19.560
But then this one did leave and we selected him good didn't leave.

179

00:11:19.570  -->  00:11:23.920
So that one did leave did leave did leave did leave and didn't leave.

180

00:11:23.920  -->  00:11:24.950
So that's a zero.

181

00:11:25.000  -->  00:11:28.750
But what we're comparing is this is we're creating a red line here.

182

00:11:28.900  -->  00:11:33.120
So this line is being compared to the random select order here.

183

00:11:33.130  -->  00:11:38.920
So as you can see by the time you get to 10 people the random select has only select two people.

184

00:11:38.980  -->  00:11:41.720
We have already identified seven people correctly.

185

00:11:41.800  -->  00:11:42.430
Right.

186

00:11:42.460  -->  00:11:47.590
If we get to that say we get to 60 people random select only gets 12 people.

187

00:11:47.590  -->  00:11:49.380
We are ready on 39.

188

00:11:49.450  -->  00:11:51.370
So let's bring up the curve again.

189

00:11:51.400  -->  00:11:53.680
So as you can see we are taking off.

190

00:11:53.680  -->  00:11:56.940
We are moving away from the round and the random is going slowly.

191

00:11:57.180  -->  00:11:59.750
It's going in line with the total percent contacted.

192

00:11:59.870  -->  00:12:06.040
So it's just a straight line whereas we are overtaking we're going faster we're finding these people

193

00:12:06.130  -->  00:12:06.550
better.

194

00:12:06.550  -->  00:12:08.140
Our model is performing.

195

00:12:08.140  -->  00:12:09.790
So is there another one hundred.

196

00:12:09.790  -->  00:12:14.800
So here a hundred people were selected.

197

00:12:15.510  -->  00:12:18.690
If we take a random hundred people then of them.

198

00:12:18.700  -->  00:12:22.410
Twenty point thirty seven we'll be lever's.

199

00:12:22.480  -->  00:12:29.860
But if we select these 100 people according to our model then of them 70 we'll have left or we will

200

00:12:29.860  -->  00:12:31.930
select correctly 70 turners.

201

00:12:31.930  -->  00:12:37.310
So that is like more than three times the performance of a random select.

202

00:12:37.420  -->  00:12:39.440
And that is exactly what we're after.

203

00:12:39.490  -->  00:12:46.940
So that's moral select and this is going to be moral select percent.

204

00:12:46.960  -->  00:12:47.480
All right.

205

00:12:47.560  -->  00:12:51.790
Now we want a percentage of the total.

206

00:12:51.850  -->  00:12:56.180
That left Don't forget to lock it in.

207

00:12:57.340  -->  00:12:59.840
This thing I'm doing I'll do it again.

208

00:13:00.130  -->  00:13:04.540
If you're not aware what I'm doing is I'm just copying it I'm going to call him so that I can go to

209

00:13:04.540  -->  00:13:11.650
the bottom of carnival down and then from here I'm going to control shift and then so from here I can

210

00:13:11.650  -->  00:13:16.750
go shift and so like many but if I get consulship it goes to the top and then I just press enter.

211

00:13:16.900  -->  00:13:20.350
So that is the model Slyke percent.

212

00:13:20.520  -->  00:13:27.220
Let's color it in a nice salmon kind of red that are following the here.

213

00:13:27.250  -->  00:13:28.090
OK good.

214

00:13:28.330  -->  00:13:36.960
And now let's take this this and this will format and we'll format it as a percentage.

215

00:13:37.630  -->  00:13:38.460
OK.

216

00:13:38.920  -->  00:13:43.140
So this is how this is the red line.

217

00:13:43.150  -->  00:13:44.080
This is the blue line.

218

00:13:44.080  -->  00:13:46.660
This is the horizontal axis.

219

00:13:46.660  -->  00:13:51.740
And you can see that the red line is by far overtaking the blue line right.

220

00:13:51.980  -->  00:13:55.670
7 So you see how fast this is increasing how slow this is increasing.

221

00:13:55.960  -->  00:13:58.270
I can here and press page down and even faster.

222

00:13:58.420  -->  00:14:05.110
So by the time we've selected 12 percent of random with the model of sector 33 and without further ado

223

00:14:05.110  -->  00:14:07.180
let's introduce the cap curve.

224

00:14:07.230  -->  00:14:08.520
All you have to do from here.

225

00:14:08.650  -->  00:14:13.120
And you can do the same thing in your template so the template will take you up to the stage just like

226

00:14:13.120  -->  00:14:13.800
this.

227

00:14:13.870  -->  00:14:22.510
This and this and then you go to insert up at the top here you select line and you select this first

228

00:14:22.510  -->  00:14:23.160
one.

229

00:14:24.010  -->  00:14:25.540
And there you go.

230

00:14:25.540  -->  00:14:31.350
One thing I will change though is a will change the name of this just to total Whoops not.

231

00:14:31.470  -->  00:14:33.570
Alan.

232

00:14:34.330  -->  00:14:37.030
All right then get rid of this.

233

00:14:37.030  -->  00:14:37.670
We don't need it.

234

00:14:37.750  -->  00:14:39.530
And there is your cap curve.

235

00:14:40.240  -->  00:14:46.990
So that's how you created in Excel and in the next tutorial we will analyze this Kepcher
