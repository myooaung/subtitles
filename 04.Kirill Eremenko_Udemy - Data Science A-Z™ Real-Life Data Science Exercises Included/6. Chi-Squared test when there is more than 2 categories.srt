1

00:00:00,800  -->  00:00:02,910
Right how did you go off that challenge.

2

00:00:02,910  -->  00:00:04,990
Here's what I got Here's my result.

3

00:00:05,040  -->  00:00:11,890
And as you can see the valleys very small so there is a statistically significant difference.

4

00:00:11,940  -->  00:00:17,850
And today we're going to finish up with the chi squared and after today's tutorial we'll definitely

5

00:00:17,850  -->  00:00:19,530
get back to the fun stuff.

6

00:00:19,530  -->  00:00:20,640
There is Alsatians.

7

00:00:20,790  -->  00:00:25,800
However we do need to discuss one more thing in terms of statistical significance and that is what to

8

00:00:25,800  -->  00:00:29,660
do when you have more than two categories in your variable.

9

00:00:29,790  -->  00:00:31,970
And let's get straight into it.

10

00:00:31,980  -->  00:00:35,160
I've got we've got a variable here which is country right.

11

00:00:35,160  -->  00:00:40,910
So how about we create a we start a statistical test for country.

12

00:00:40,920  -->  00:00:45,600
So I'm going to copy this tab over here just as we did previously.

13

00:00:45,630  -->  00:00:50,300
I'll rename it to country actuals.

14

00:00:50,820  -->  00:01:00,930
And now I'm going to take a country where is the geography replace gender and let's make some room and

15

00:01:00,960  -->  00:01:02,860
get rid of the label.

16

00:01:03,120  -->  00:01:03,560
And there we go.

17

00:01:03,560  -->  00:01:04,920
So we've got the actuals here.

18

00:01:04,920  -->  00:01:06,000
So I'm going to show you two ways.

19

00:01:06,000  -->  00:01:13,680
First I'm going to show you the proper way and then I'm going to show you my tricky quick way that I

20

00:01:13,800  -->  00:01:15,390
like to use sometimes.

21

00:01:15,390  -->  00:01:22,470
So to start off with the proper way you need to run a square test for a larger table you can't just

22

00:01:22,470  -->  00:01:28,430
run it for two categories that you need to run and for all three categories.

23

00:01:28,440  -->  00:01:32,160
And for that there's a different website which is B.

24

00:01:32,250  -->  00:01:37,520
S S A R A stats dot net slash new CSIR HMO.

25

00:01:37,860  -->  00:01:44,640
And what we can do here is input the values into here we don't even need the actual totals for each

26

00:01:44,640  -->  00:01:50,880
category we just need the numbers in the blue and orange squares by the way there is a quick way to

27

00:01:51,480  -->  00:01:53,400
look at this data as a table.

28

00:01:53,400  -->  00:02:00,180
So if you just go to show me and you click table and then you transpose it and then you make some more

29

00:02:00,180  -->  00:02:06,390
space then you pretty much have the table ready so that where you can make a mistake when you're copying

30

00:02:06,390  -->  00:02:07,960
your values.

31

00:02:08,220  -->  00:02:09,900
So let's zoom in on that.

32

00:02:10,140  -->  00:02:20,430
And then we go for 4 8 10 1 6 9 5 8 1 4 and 2 0 6 4 4 1 3.

33

00:02:20,790  -->  00:02:28,200
So calculate and this chi square test has been run for three categories now.

34

00:02:28,320  -->  00:02:31,150
And as you can see there's the P-value it's very small.

35

00:02:31,200  -->  00:02:37,950
And once again that means that there is a statistical significance meaning that when you go to the overall

36

00:02:38,520  -->  00:02:44,070
population rather than look at sample when you go to the overall population you will also see an effect

37

00:02:44,070  -->  00:02:49,620
similar to this you'll see that people who reside in Germany are more likely to leave the bank than

38

00:02:49,620  -->  00:02:51,980
people who reside in Spain or France.

39

00:02:52,170  -->  00:02:54,570
So that's how you should do it properly.

40

00:02:54,810  -->  00:03:00,560
But as you can imagine as you get more categories it gets harder to put that table.

41

00:03:00,630  -->  00:03:05,220
And moreover this specific tool only has a limitation of five by five right.

42

00:03:05,250  -->  00:03:09,990
And you don't want to sit there and just input data all the time especially when you can see we can

43

00:03:09,990  -->  00:03:12,290
already see that there is a difference.

44

00:03:12,300  -->  00:03:13,530
You can see it here.

45

00:03:13,710  -->  00:03:21,840
So why should you waste your valuable time and in put this dotted just to validate something you already

46

00:03:21,840  -->  00:03:22,040
know.

47

00:03:22,040  -->  00:03:22,970
You do need to validate.

48

00:03:22,970  -->  00:03:23,940
But is there a quick away.

49

00:03:24,150  -->  00:03:31,610
So I offer you my approach that I kind of like a lot and let's have a look at it in a visual manner

50

00:03:31,620  -->  00:03:33,140
that'll make a lot of sense.

51

00:03:33,150  -->  00:03:36,130
So here's our countries.

52

00:03:36,150  -->  00:03:39,870
So France Germany and Spain.

53

00:03:39,900  -->  00:03:40,550
Right.

54

00:03:40,560  -->  00:03:50,700
What are we trying to do is compare these rates of living or these chances of people leaving the bank

55

00:03:51,360  -->  00:03:53,110
for different geographies and what to say.

56

00:03:53,160  -->  00:03:57,480
Is this a statistically significant results or will this result be the same for the overall population

57

00:03:57,480  -->  00:03:57,840
.

58

00:03:57,840  -->  00:04:04,590
Right now we're comparing all of them so we're saying is in general the country you reside in an important

59

00:04:04,590  -->  00:04:05,690
variable.

60

00:04:06,300  -->  00:04:10,040
So my suggestion here is why do we need compare all of them.

61

00:04:10,050  -->  00:04:11,640
Why do we need to compare all three.

62

00:04:11,640  -->  00:04:17,150
How do we just separate one of them like we forget about this part.

63

00:04:17,150  -->  00:04:24,120
Forget about the popular or the people from the sample size that live in Spain and just compare France

64

00:04:24,120  -->  00:04:24,870
Germany.

65

00:04:24,900  -->  00:04:25,820
Right.

66

00:04:25,950  -->  00:04:31,080
What if we find a significant difference there is between the two these two categories then that will

67

00:04:31,080  -->  00:04:34,630
mean that overall there is a significant impact.

68

00:04:34,620  -->  00:04:43,710
So basically we're saying that if Germany and Germany are leaving more have a higher chance of living

69

00:04:43,710  -->  00:04:48,390
and people in France than by adding people from Spain it won't change it's still going to have a higher

70

00:04:48,390  -->  00:04:50,610
chance of living than people in France.

71

00:04:50,610  -->  00:04:54,320
Maybe something there will be a different relationship to people from Spain.

72

00:04:54,420  -->  00:04:58,770
But we don't really care about that right now what we're saying is that there is a statistically significant

73

00:04:58,770  -->  00:05:05,860
difference for this specific variable and we can extrapolate it onto the whole population.

74

00:05:06,030  -->  00:05:11,530
And in a way what you the way you can confirm that this logic is true is.

75

00:05:11,670  -->  00:05:14,580
Think of it as this is your test right.

76

00:05:14,610  -->  00:05:20,450
You had people from France people from Germany and people from Spain participate in your test.

77

00:05:20,490  -->  00:05:26,130
Now imagine you had decide designed your test differently imagine you had designed a test in a way that

78

00:05:26,130  -->  00:05:30,050
you only looked at people from France and people from Germany.

79

00:05:30,060  -->  00:05:35,080
You didn't look at people from France from Spain at all and you looked at exactly the same people.

80

00:05:35,100  -->  00:05:37,610
So do you think the result would have changed.

81

00:05:37,800  -->  00:05:42,410
Well obviously not because these people are not related in any way.

82

00:05:42,630  -->  00:05:48,810
And that's that's how your test is constructed that there is no interdependencies so the decisions of

83

00:05:48,810  -->  00:05:53,510
these people to leave or stay if the bank does not affected by the decisions of these people.

84

00:05:54,180  -->  00:06:00,150
And so therefore you can totally separate your categories so you can if you have many categories within

85

00:06:00,150  -->  00:06:05,940
one variable like here country you can take any subset of those categories and compare them between

86

00:06:05,940  -->  00:06:07,660
each other using a chi squared test.

87

00:06:07,860  -->  00:06:09,900
And that is totally totally fine.

88

00:06:10,050  -->  00:06:13,710
So let's go back to our worksheet.

89

00:06:13,830  -->  00:06:18,200
So here you can see that between Spain and France is probably not a significant difference right.

90

00:06:18,210  -->  00:06:25,050
So why would you ever run a quick test between this and this right to prove something instead let's

91

00:06:25,050  -->  00:06:30,000
run a quick test between France and Germany and prove that there is a similarly significant difference

92

00:06:30,000  -->  00:06:30,880
between them.

93

00:06:31,230  -->  00:06:36,810
And that will be sufficient for us to say that geography as a variable is an important variable.

94

00:06:36,810  -->  00:06:41,740
It does play an important role in the decision of people to stay or leave the bank.

95

00:06:41,880  -->  00:06:43,660
And that's my handy trick.

96

00:06:43,860  -->  00:06:46,860
So that's our country of.

97

00:06:47,120  -->  00:06:50,660
We've already done the test for country actually right.

98

00:06:50,670  -->  00:06:56,670
So obviously if we run this test now for France and Germany we will also get a statistically significant

99

00:06:56,670  -->  00:07:00,220
result and I'll leave that up to you if you'd like to check that.

100

00:07:00,360  -->  00:07:02,700
That's totally fine.

101

00:07:02,700  -->  00:07:08,820
The other thing I wanted to show you here is that if we all go to age you'll see that there's a lot

102

00:07:08,820  -->  00:07:15,380
more categories here and would be a very painful exercise to run a quick test for all of them.

103

00:07:15,540  -->  00:07:20,460
However you can use this as practice and pick out the categories where you think there is a statistically

104

00:07:20,460  -->  00:07:22,000
significant difference.

105

00:07:22,500  -->  00:07:23,240
I'll give you a hint.

106

00:07:23,260  -->  00:07:32,210
Maybe a 50 and 55 or 25 and 35 something got any to that where you can see there's it looks like there's

107

00:07:32,220  -->  00:07:35,270
a difference and just run a quick test for those two.

108

00:07:35,490  -->  00:07:41,560
And that way you will have sufficient evidence to say that age is an important variable.

109

00:07:41,850  -->  00:07:49,890
And so that's how we validate the insights that we derive from this visual improvisation of our statistical

110

00:07:49,890  -->  00:07:50,550
tests.

111

00:07:50,670  -->  00:07:52,180
As you can see it's not that hard.

112

00:07:52,230  -->  00:07:59,020
And in combination those two methods complement each other you can quickly get insights using Tablo

113

00:07:59,030  -->  00:07:59,110
.

114

00:07:59,220  -->  00:08:05,320
And then where you do suspect a statistically significant difference you can quickly validate it using

115

00:08:05,330  -->  00:08:08,940
a squared test and that's all for today's tutorial in the next one.

116

00:08:08,940  -->  00:08:13,640
We'll get back to creating some more cool visuals and I'll look for see you next time.

117

00:08:13,650  -->  00:08:15,190
Until then happy analyzing
