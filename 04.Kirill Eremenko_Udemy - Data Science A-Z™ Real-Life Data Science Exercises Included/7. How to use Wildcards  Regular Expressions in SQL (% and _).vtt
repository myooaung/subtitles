00:00:00.480  -->  00:00:07.110
Today we'll talk about wild cards wild cards basically are another name for regular expressions and

2

00:00:07.110  -->  00:00:15.420
regular expressions allow you to look for strings which contain certain substrings or words or text

3

00:00:15.420  -->  00:00:20.310
or letters or other things that you are looking for in that string.

4

00:00:20.310  -->  00:00:25.680
So you don't have to specify an exact string and you can match lots of different strings that fit your

5

00:00:25.680  -->  00:00:26.840
certain criteria.

6

00:00:27.030  -->  00:00:32.290
So let's have a look at that on an example and it will make more sense as we go along.

7

00:00:32.520  -->  00:00:37.320
This time we're going to work with the other table that we have which is list of orders so let's get

8

00:00:37.320  -->  00:00:47.360
rid of all of this and we'll type in select star from list of orders.

9

00:00:47.670  -->  00:00:54.210
And if we select everything we just execute that now you will see that we've got Order ID order date

10

00:00:54.240  -->  00:00:55.940
Customer Name country.

11

00:00:56.220  -->  00:01:07.210
And so for instance let's say we're interested in any order ID that has us at the start.

12

00:01:07.230  -->  00:01:09.750
So any order ID that starts with.

13

00:01:09.760  -->  00:01:12.560
Yes that's the ones that we want to bring up.

14

00:01:12.570  -->  00:01:13.760
So how do we do that.

15

00:01:13.770  -->  00:01:19.330
Well in this case we will type in where as we're used to then Order ID.

16

00:01:19.360  -->  00:01:22.770
So square brackets Order ID.

17

00:01:22.950  -->  00:01:27.420
And this is one of the second Sinatras where you need square brackets because there's a space in the

18

00:01:27.420  -->  00:01:28.790
name of your column.

19

00:01:29.430  -->  00:01:36.540
And now we're going to say like so we can use equals in this case because we're using a wildcard we

20

00:01:36.540  -->  00:01:40.120
need to use the other option which is like.

21

00:01:40.320  -->  00:01:44.210
And here we will compare to wild cards so we want.

22

00:01:44.220  -->  00:01:45.620
I was trying to start off.

23

00:01:45.630  -->  00:01:46.590
Yes.

24

00:01:46.950  -->  00:01:54.390
And then after Yes we don't mind how many characters they are what they are we just want to make sure

25

00:01:54.390  -->  00:01:56.920
that the string size vs and to do that.

26

00:01:56.990  -->  00:02:00.090
After Yes here we just need to type in a percentage sign.

27

00:02:00.090  -->  00:02:06.090
So the percentage side is a wild card for any number of characters.

28

00:02:06.180  -->  00:02:13.340
And now if we execute this you will notice that only the rows that have an order ID starting with S

29

00:02:13.470  -->  00:02:15.480
have been returned.

30

00:02:15.480  -->  00:02:18.520
Similarly we can do the same thing for the orders.

31

00:02:18.560  -->  00:02:21.020
That's right.

32

00:02:22.200  -->  00:02:23.700
And if we run that now.

33

00:02:23.700  -->  00:02:26.740
So I just clicked a five on my keyboard.

34

00:02:26.790  -->  00:02:31.580
If we were that now we have only the orders that start with T.

35

00:02:31.650  -->  00:02:33.690
So that's one of the wildcards that you'll be using.

36

00:02:33.690  -->  00:02:38.030
You can put the percentage sign at the start in the middle at the end of your string.

37

00:02:38.250  -->  00:02:45.960
Let's have a look at another example let's say we want all of the countries that have a letter E inside

38

00:02:46.140  -->  00:02:47.870
of the name of the country.

39

00:02:47.970  -->  00:02:52.240
So let's type in here percentage.

40

00:02:52.410  -->  00:02:57.770
So we don't we don't care how many symbols they are before that.

41

00:02:57.960  -->  00:02:59.110
Then we need an e.

42

00:02:59.190  -->  00:03:03.350
And then another percentage so we don't care how many symbols are after the Super exit.

43

00:03:03.420  -->  00:03:10.350
That now you will see here that only countries with a letter E inside their name have been brought up

44

00:03:10.530  -->  00:03:10.790
in this.

45

00:03:10.830  -->  00:03:14.130
And it doesn't really matter if that is at the very end.

46

00:03:14.310  -->  00:03:15.130
That's OK.

47

00:03:15.360  -->  00:03:17.460
So that's how you use the percentage sign.

48

00:03:17.490  -->  00:03:21.690
Now I'll show you one more wild card that you might be interested in.

49

00:03:21.690  -->  00:03:28.020
I never use it in my work but there might be a case when you might sometime need to use it.

50

00:03:28.020  -->  00:03:32.470
The wildcard is an underscore and the underscore stands for exactly one character.

51

00:03:32.610  -->  00:03:40.590
For instance let's look for all the people all the customers whose second letter in their name is and

52

00:03:41.400  -->  00:03:42.820
a for instance.

53

00:03:42.900  -->  00:03:51.720
So here we're going to change this to and like and then we will change this as underscore E and then

54

00:03:51.720  -->  00:03:52.340
a percentage.

55

00:03:52.350  -->  00:03:57.990
So we want to make sure there's one character then there's an E and then there is however many characters

56

00:03:57.990  -->  00:03:59.260
we don't really mind.

57

00:03:59.300  -->  00:04:02.550
So if we execute that you will see that there's Peter here.

58

00:04:02.580  -->  00:04:09.710
Herbert can all of these names their second letter in this string in the name is an E.

59

00:04:09.870  -->  00:04:12.050
And that's exactly what we were after.

60

00:04:12.060  -->  00:04:13.990
So there you go that's how you use wild cards.

61

00:04:14.010  -->  00:04:16.110
You can only use them with strings.

62

00:04:16.110  -->  00:04:22.830
Make sure use the like operator because if that equals then it won't work equal sign takes this stuff

63

00:04:22.830  -->  00:04:28.090
literally and it doesn't look for wild cards it looks for exactly this string underscore percentage

64

00:04:28.090  -->  00:04:28.480
.

65

00:04:28.530  -->  00:04:36.930
So make sure use the like when you're working with wild wild cards and it allows you to search for elements

66

00:04:36.930  -->  00:04:37.510
of strings
