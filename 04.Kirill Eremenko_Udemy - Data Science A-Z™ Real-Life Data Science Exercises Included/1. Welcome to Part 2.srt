00:00:02,800  -->  00:00:04,850
Is

2

00:00:07,290  -->  00:00:12,300
welcome to the modeling part of the course you're about to embark upon a journey which is interesting

3

00:00:12,390  -->  00:00:18,510
and challenging which will take you from not knowing anything about stats to be able to build a full

4

00:00:18,510  -->  00:00:24,450
fledged statistical model and to add that we're talking about building them all assessing them while

5

00:00:24,750  -->  00:00:31,360
testing the model deriving insights from them all and even maintaining a model post delivery.

6

00:00:31,380  -->  00:00:36,550
This section has over 50 lectures and we'll feel like a separate course in itself.

7

00:00:36,750  -->  00:00:43,020
And that is why I wanted to take some time to make sure that our expectations are set before you commit

8

00:00:43,110  -->  00:00:44,010
to this journey.

9

00:00:44,280  -->  00:00:49,900
So let's go over some key goals that we want to cover off in this part of the course.

10

00:00:50,160  -->  00:00:57,240
Keypoint number one there is a huge tendency these days to associate data science with our programming

11

00:00:57,600  -->  00:00:58,440
and programming.

12

00:00:58,530  -->  00:00:59,970
This quarter is not like that.

13

00:01:00,240  -->  00:01:04,440
My goal is not to teach you our programming or Python programming.

14

00:01:04,440  -->  00:01:10,620
My goal is to teach you how to be a scientist how to think like a data scientist how to create models

15

00:01:10,920  -->  00:01:15,470
and what tools you use whether it's SPSS SAS or Python.

16

00:01:15,600  -->  00:01:21,240
You can use any tool later on after you have learned the fundamentals of creating a model.

17

00:01:21,330  -->  00:01:25,350
And so with that in mind we won't be going through our programming.

18

00:01:25,350  -->  00:01:30,600
I won't be teaching you how to program an R R has a very steep learning curve and it could take a whole

19

00:01:30,600  -->  00:01:33,380
separate course to teach you how to program it.

20

00:01:33,540  -->  00:01:37,030
And I don't want to get bogged down in all of the coding.

21

00:01:37,050  -->  00:01:43,580
I would rather focus on the actual modeling part of the things and explain the intrinsics of moment

22

00:01:43,580  -->  00:01:47,490
to you because I personally believe that that is way more valuable.

23

00:01:47,520  -->  00:01:52,980
And with that in mind we're going to be using a visual software package which is called Grettel it's

24

00:01:52,980  -->  00:01:59,170
free and able to download it and stole it and that will allow us to get rid of that whole part.

25

00:01:59,170  -->  00:02:05,850
We have to think about coding and understand it and you know like learn a lot of stuff about our in

26

00:02:05,850  -->  00:02:07,320
order to get to the end result.

27

00:02:07,380  -->  00:02:11,330
We can just actually focus on the motorway.

28

00:02:11,550  -->  00:02:17,340
Point number two as mentioned before our end goal is to be able to build a full fledged statistical

29

00:02:17,340  -->  00:02:18,040
model.

30

00:02:18,060  -->  00:02:22,500
However I don't want to just give you a set of mechanical steps that need to fold to get to the end

31

00:02:22,500  -->  00:02:23,070
result.

32

00:02:23,250  -->  00:02:27,890
I want to help you understand what exactly is going on when you're running these small.

33

00:02:28,200  -->  00:02:32,040
And that's why I will be focusing quite a bit on intuitional things.

34

00:02:32,070  -->  00:02:34,430
We'll talk about the intuitional logistic regression.

35

00:02:34,470  -->  00:02:39,530
We'll talk about intuitional multicollinearity and quite a few other aspects.

36

00:02:39,780  -->  00:02:45,120
So by the end of this part of the course you should not only be able to create the model but be able

37

00:02:45,120  -->  00:02:50,760
to intrinsically understand what is going on in the background when you're running.

38

00:02:51,630  -->  00:02:57,300
And finally in order to get to our end goal step by step I have broken down this part of the course

39

00:02:57,360  -->  00:02:58,860
into logical sections.

40

00:02:59,160  -->  00:03:01,180
First we will have a stat's refresh.

41

00:03:01,530  -->  00:03:04,830
Then we will talk about the simple linear regression.

42

00:03:05,040  -->  00:03:10,650
Then we will move onto the multiple linear regression after that we will talk about the logistic regression

43

00:03:11,070  -->  00:03:18,000
and then we will build our geo demographic segmentation model and after we've built it we will learn

44

00:03:18,000  -->  00:03:24,570
how to test and assess our model then we will learn how to derive insights from our model then we will

45

00:03:24,570  -->  00:03:31,110
talk about how we can maintain our model post-delivery and fight any kind of deterioration that might

46

00:03:31,110  -->  00:03:31,990
be going on.

47

00:03:32,190  -->  00:03:38,190
And finally at the very end of this part of the course I will give you some extra tips tricks and hacks

48

00:03:38,190  -->  00:03:43,170
that you can take away to really improve your modeling.

49

00:03:43,170  -->  00:03:46,260
So that's what we're going to be talking about in this part of the course.

50

00:03:46,320  -->  00:03:52,790
I really hope you enjoy this journey and go through it all the way with me and I look forward to seeing

51

00:03:52,830  -->  00:03:53,540
in the first section
