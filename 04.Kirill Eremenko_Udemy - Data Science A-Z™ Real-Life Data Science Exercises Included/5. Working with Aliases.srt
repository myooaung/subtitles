1

00:00:00,700  -->  00:00:07,540
And the previous tutorial we stopped after we made this visual AB test and we have the results here

2

00:00:07,540  -->  00:00:07,560
.

3

00:00:07,570  -->  00:00:12,620
So I really hope that it was quite clear what exactly we did.

4

00:00:12,630  -->  00:00:17,170
We have now percentages of the total males that left the company.

5

00:00:17,160  -->  00:00:22,500
So those are the orange and the percentages of total females that left the company 25 percent.

6

00:00:22,500  -->  00:00:25,260
Also an orange and so not just comparing them visually.

7

00:00:25,380  -->  00:00:32,580
You can say that females are more likely to leave the company than males all other things held equal

8

00:00:32,580  -->  00:00:32,770
.

9

00:00:32,780  -->  00:00:40,590
However do bear in mind that once again this is not a full fledged statistical AB test.

10

00:00:40,590  -->  00:00:46,270
We didn't check for statistical significance and but it does give you some insights into the data.

11

00:00:46,440  -->  00:00:49,830
So today what we're going to do is we're going to learn how to work with alias's.

12

00:00:50,040  -->  00:00:55,630
But before we proceed Let's quickly fix up the format of this tab.

13

00:00:55,650  -->  00:01:01,620
So we're just going to right click somewhere not on the data and we'll click Format and we'll change

14

00:01:01,620  -->  00:01:02,730
this to 12.

15

00:01:02,730  -->  00:01:04,860
So 12 overall.

16

00:01:04,980  -->  00:01:11,730
Now the beauty of using Tablo for data mining rather than visualization is that you don't have to always

17

00:01:11,790  -->  00:01:17,340
make things look great because you're not going to be presenting every single chart that you're creating

18

00:01:17,330  -->  00:01:17,510
.

19

00:01:17,550  -->  00:01:22,320
For instance I'm not going to change this header over here like if I was going to put in a report I

20

00:01:22,320  -->  00:01:23,080
would change it.

21

00:01:23,340  -->  00:01:30,790
And but in this case it's just for our sake so I'm not going to rename the y axis over here.

22

00:01:30,990  -->  00:01:33,510
So now what I want to do is I want to rename the sheet.

23

00:01:33,510  -->  00:01:40,140
So here we'll call it gender and now working with alias's.

24

00:01:40,170  -->  00:01:48,070
So here you can see that we've got exited 0 and 1 meaning 0 is people who didn't exit and one is orange

25

00:01:48,070  -->  00:01:48,120
.

26

00:01:48,120  -->  00:01:54,690
People who did X and now even for our sake let alone when we put this into our if we decide to put this

27

00:01:54,690  -->  00:01:57,510
specific charge into report this is a bit.

28

00:01:57,900  -->  00:02:00,990
It's not quite it's not that obvious So why is it a one way a zero.

29

00:02:00,990  -->  00:02:02,880
People don't think in binary terms.

30

00:02:02,880  -->  00:02:04,560
People think in words.

31

00:02:04,620  -->  00:02:09,150
So how about we change these and give them some aliases.

32

00:02:09,150  -->  00:02:11,750
So one way is to create a calculated field.

33

00:02:11,880  -->  00:02:19,050
Another way is to actually change your dimension or your column you know changing in the data set.

34

00:02:19,050  -->  00:02:24,180
We want to change it in Tablo because we know that for every single child we create we want this to

35

00:02:24,180  -->  00:02:27,990
actually say words rather than numbers we're never going to use the numbers we're never going to add

36

00:02:27,990  -->  00:02:29,500
them up or do anything with them.

37

00:02:29,730  -->  00:02:37,380
So we're going to right click this exited colon and we'll go to alias's over here.

38

00:02:38,250  -->  00:02:44,720
And so now in alias's you can specify what alias to use for certain values.

39

00:02:44,790  -->  00:02:54,180
So let's say if our value is 0 then we want to say stage right that person state and the value is what

40

00:02:54,190  -->  00:02:56,770
we want to say that that person exited.

41

00:02:57,170  -->  00:02:57,850
OK.

42

00:02:58,110  -->  00:03:04,710
And so right away you can see that the values changed over here in the color legend and they're going

43

00:03:04,710  -->  00:03:09,720
to be like that through out every worksheet that recreates is going to be much more convenient for us

44

00:03:09,730  -->  00:03:09,950
.

45

00:03:10,110  -->  00:03:18,360
And now because we have these aliases we can even drag them this column onto our label as well.

46

00:03:18,360  -->  00:03:20,390
So here you can see it's much better now.

47

00:03:20,400  -->  00:03:27,810
People don't have to look at the code legends to understand which state which people exited so you can

48

00:03:27,810  -->  00:03:33,540
do it either way if you feel that this is sufficient for you then go ahead with that if you want to

49

00:03:33,540  -->  00:03:38,770
present and perhaps you want to make it more clear what exactly is going on.

50

00:03:38,820  -->  00:03:43,710
Then I would put exited in here.

51

00:03:43,710  -->  00:03:47,000
Of course you have to make sure that it fits and we'll see that.

52

00:03:47,130  -->  00:03:50,200
We'll talk about that later when we're creating more of these.

53

00:03:50,250  -->  00:03:55,530
So that's how you work with alias's hope that was useful and I hope you do find ways to use aliases

54

00:03:55,620  -->  00:03:56,810
in your work.

55

00:03:56,810  -->  00:04:01,690
They can really make life easier and make your presentations more legible.

56

00:04:01,950  -->  00:04:03,290
And I look for it scenics them.

57

00:04:03,360  -->  00:04:04,890
Until then happy analyzing
