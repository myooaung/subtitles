1

00:00:01,620  -->  00:00:05,170
Too quickly recap last time we found two anomalies.

2

00:00:05,220  -->  00:00:09,490
First of all in row 81 all of the columns got skewed to the left.

3

00:00:09,630  -->  00:00:18,840
You can see here that there's nothing after email address inclusive and in row 96 all the columns got

4

00:00:18,840  -->  00:00:20,060
skewed the opposite way.

5

00:00:20,060  -->  00:00:28,320
Everything moved to the right after a certain point over here and there therefore this last record is

6

00:00:28,320  -->  00:00:30,170
now in its own column.

7

00:00:30,270  -->  00:00:36,420
So we're going to investigate that today and we're going to start with 96 because it's the easier one

8

00:00:36,420  -->  00:00:36,910
.

9

00:00:37,200  -->  00:00:39,600
Let's scroll and see where this happened.

10

00:00:39,600  -->  00:00:42,190
Where did the column start skewing to the right.

11

00:00:42,270  -->  00:00:44,200
For now everything is good good.

12

00:00:44,220  -->  00:00:45,780
And then over here you can see.

13

00:00:45,780  -->  00:00:46,350
Thank you.

14

00:00:46,350  -->  00:00:53,790
Great experience and then the e-mail is skewed so that means once again this comment got split into

15

00:00:53,790  -->  00:00:54,340
two.

16

00:00:54,630  -->  00:00:59,910
And there was something wrong with the text qualifier as you can see one quotation mark here so let's

17

00:00:59,910  -->  00:01:05,190
go into our file and investigate this further.

18

00:01:05,190  -->  00:01:10,560
Now we need to open up our project folder and we're not going to touch the file in our uploaded data

19

00:01:10,590  -->  00:01:15,190
folder because as of now our upload has failed and we're going to have to replace this file.

20

00:01:15,270  -->  00:01:20,970
We're going to go back and we're going to move to our prepared data folder.

21

00:01:20,970  -->  00:01:24,530
So here we're going to open this up in Notepad plus plus.

22

00:01:24,540  -->  00:01:28,800
And at the same time what we're going to do is we're going to open up the original data folder but we're

23

00:01:28,800  -->  00:01:37,080
not going to obviously open the file that we have here we are going to copy it once again we will paste

24

00:01:37,080  -->  00:01:39,720
it here.

25

00:01:39,720  -->  00:01:40,710
We don't want to replace.

26

00:01:40,710  -->  00:01:43,760
We want to copy but give it a different name.

27

00:01:43,770  -->  00:01:49,310
And so he will say original so we know what we're dealing with.

28

00:01:50,110  -->  00:01:50,380
OK.

29

00:01:50,400  -->  00:01:54,850
So now we will open this one up as well.

30

00:01:54,990  -->  00:02:02,010
And so let's have a look to look at the both files at the same time you need to right click on the original

31

00:02:02,010  -->  00:02:05,940
or one of them and select move to other view.

32

00:02:05,940  -->  00:02:10,070
Now you've got the original at the bottom and you've got the prepared file at the top.

33

00:02:10,200  -->  00:02:12,900
And we also want to synchronize with the scrolling.

34

00:02:12,900  -->  00:02:17,850
So if I want to scroll this follow this file to scroll as well so maybe let's increase the size here

35

00:02:17,850  -->  00:02:21,060
a bit so that the same size.

36

00:02:21,060  -->  00:02:22,170
That's about right.

37

00:02:22,230  -->  00:02:28,200
And we want to synchronize the scrolling so you go to View syncro nice vertical scrolling and maybe

38

00:02:28,200  -->  00:02:32,470
horizontals or so now when I scroll one file the other one scrolls as well.

39

00:02:32,580  -->  00:02:36,790
And that way it's very easy to navigate and find any changes.

40

00:02:36,870  -->  00:02:38,700
And that's exactly what you want to have a look at.

41

00:02:38,700  -->  00:02:43,650
I want to show you what happened in the prepared file and I want to show you what it looked like in

42

00:02:43,650  -->  00:02:46,750
the original file because it's always good to revert to the original.

43

00:02:46,800  -->  00:02:49,090
You can already see some differences for instance.

44

00:02:49,140  -->  00:02:52,290
There are quotation marks here and there are no quotation marks here.

45

00:02:52,470  -->  00:02:55,020
Well the reason for that is very simple.

46

00:02:55,410  -->  00:03:02,280
In the original file there were quotation marks because this is a CACP file and you had to qualify this

47

00:03:02,280  -->  00:03:03,100
text delimiter.

48

00:03:03,120  -->  00:03:10,170
Therefore saying that this is actually a comma inside the dollar or the dollar amount and therefore

49

00:03:10,170  -->  00:03:15,820
you need these quotation marks to tell in your program that's dealing with this file that this comma

50

00:03:15,840  -->  00:03:18,260
is not a delimiter.

51

00:03:18,300  -->  00:03:22,830
And then when we did we did in Excel is we removed the commas as you remember and the dollar signs and

52

00:03:22,830  -->  00:03:27,300
since there's no Colmar anymore here there's no need for the quotation marks and therefore Excel did

53

00:03:27,300  -->  00:03:29,790
not place any quotation marks.

54

00:03:29,790  -->  00:03:34,960
So nullus scroll down to row number 96 and have a look at what is going on over there.

55

00:03:35,160  -->  00:03:36,900
So there is a row number 96.

56

00:03:36,890  -->  00:03:37,740
There it is.

57

00:03:38,010  -->  00:03:43,290
And we want to find out why the rows are the columns shifted to the right.

58

00:03:43,290  -->  00:03:46,780
We already know that that happened somewhere around the Calment area.

59

00:03:46,860  -->  00:03:50,270
So there is a common here.

60

00:03:50,750  -->  00:03:52,230
This is in the prepared file.

61

00:03:52,230  -->  00:03:57,800
The one that we manipulated in Excel and this is our home cell.

62

00:03:57,870  -->  00:04:02,350
That same comment in or feedback in the original file.

63

00:04:02,370  -->  00:04:04,650
So here you can see several things.

64

00:04:04,650  -->  00:04:10,690
First of all here there's a lot of quotation marks and here is one quotation mark.

65

00:04:10,800  -->  00:04:12,600
And here there's is an extra mark his nothing.

66

00:04:12,600  -->  00:04:18,220
So right away you can see that there was corruption in the original file it was it was corrupted.

67

00:04:18,660  -->  00:04:24,330
It was supposed to be two quotation marks or one here one here and somehow it so happened that the quotation

68

00:04:24,330  -->  00:04:26,150
mark disappeared from the start.

69

00:04:26,370  -->  00:04:32,340
And therefore now we're seeing these errors which you're seeing here in the prepared file is the result

70

00:04:32,400  -->  00:04:37,350
of all manipulations in Excel of course they were inadvertent we didn't want we didn't specifically

71

00:04:37,900  -->  00:04:46,880
target this call cell but this Excel has its own as you realize by now Excel has a life of its own and

72

00:04:46,890  -->  00:04:47,630
does its own thing.

73

00:04:47,640  -->  00:04:54,030
So when excel saw this single quotation mark in it couldn't obviously understand that this is a whole

74

00:04:54,030  -->  00:04:59,050
phrase and it should be fixed so this quotation mark has has to be returned.

75

00:04:59,130  -->  00:05:01,920
Instead what it did is it decided OK.

76

00:05:01,920  -->  00:05:04,400
So there's is a quotation mark here.

77

00:05:04,540  -->  00:05:14,190
And so therefore this part is one one piece of text or one element with a quotation mark so a quotation

78

00:05:14,190  -->  00:05:17,120
mark is not a standard symbol that you see in text.

79

00:05:17,130  -->  00:05:18,790
Usually I use quotation marks.

80

00:05:18,790  -->  00:05:20,070
This is Excel thinking.

81

00:05:20,070  -->  00:05:25,100
Usually I use quotation marks too as text qualifiers.

82

00:05:25,200  -->  00:05:28,050
So what I need to do is this is what Excel did.

83

00:05:28,080  -->  00:05:28,880
It went OK.

84

00:05:28,890  -->  00:05:35,700
I'm going to take this text which is kind of anomalous and looks like it might be an error in here and

85

00:05:35,700  -->  00:05:37,350
I'm going to qualify it.

86

00:05:37,500  -->  00:05:43,750
So I'm going to put another set of text qualifiers around this text like that there.

87

00:05:43,800  -->  00:05:45,050
So meaning that's OK.

88

00:05:45,060  -->  00:05:50,790
This is one block of text including this quotation mark and that's how it should be treated.

89

00:05:50,910  -->  00:05:52,860
But now you can see that there's three over here.

90

00:05:52,880  -->  00:05:53,670
What does that mean.

91

00:05:53,670  -->  00:06:01,080
Well in reality what happens is if you want to unqualified a quotation mark within a text you need to

92

00:06:01,080  -->  00:06:03,180
put another quotation mark before it.

93

00:06:03,180  -->  00:06:09,480
So basically what happened is AAVSO Excel did that put all of this text into quotation marks it said

94

00:06:09,690  -->  00:06:13,680
well actually the user obviously wanted a quotation mark within this text.

95

00:06:13,680  -->  00:06:19,140
So I'm going to unqualified so and it put another quotation mark before and therefore you go now you

96

00:06:19,140  -->  00:06:22,810
have to these quotation marks on the sides.

97

00:06:22,880  -->  00:06:24,910
Qualifying the whole phrase.

98

00:06:25,050  -->  00:06:27,700
Then you've got the phrase with the quotation mark.

99

00:06:27,750  -->  00:06:31,530
But in order for the quotation mark to be displayed it has to be unqualified to have another quotation

100

00:06:31,530  -->  00:06:32,410
mark.

101

00:06:32,560  -->  00:06:36,890
It can be a bit confusing but that is how SEUS view files work.

102

00:06:36,930  -->  00:06:37,950
And those are the rules.

103

00:06:37,950  -->  00:06:40,260
And that is what is exactly what Excel did.

104

00:06:40,620  -->  00:06:42,330
And so I'm just going to return that.

105

00:06:42,330  -->  00:06:51,780
So we don't have this have this file modified at all here so what Excel essentially did is it made this

106

00:06:52,320  -->  00:06:54,520
modification to this part of the text.

107

00:06:54,570  -->  00:06:59,670
That's what you see here and it's doesn't need any quotation marks here because there's no Como's there's

108

00:06:59,670  -->  00:07:04,920
no quotation marks that are part of the text and therefore Excel just left it as it is.

109

00:07:04,920  -->  00:07:10,560
And now we see this as a separate data element a separate column and then this as a separate column

110

00:07:10,590  -->  00:07:12,290
and therefore everything is skewed.

111

00:07:12,420  -->  00:07:21,130
So you see South Africa here South Africa and then this goes in line with the comments or this column

112

00:07:21,150  -->  00:07:28,080
over here where the feedback goes normally and then this text or whatever is inside the quotation marks

113

00:07:28,090  -->  00:07:32,930
this bit here goes where the email is supposed to go normally.

114

00:07:33,210  -->  00:07:35,840
So that's what happened over here.

115

00:07:35,910  -->  00:07:37,550
We're going to correct this now.

116

00:07:37,770  -->  00:07:40,680
I'll just show you how to correct anomalies in a text files.

117

00:07:40,710  -->  00:07:41,850
Good exercise.

118

00:07:41,850  -->  00:07:47,990
So what we want to do we know exactly what is supposed to be in this speech is supposed to be here.

119

00:07:47,990  -->  00:07:53,190
So we want to take this quotation mark and we want to move it to the start of the text and then we know

120

00:07:53,190  -->  00:07:54,630
that there shouldn't be a quotation mark.

121

00:07:54,630  -->  00:08:00,690
Therefore we should delete this quotation mark along with the qualifying symbol.

122

00:08:00,960  -->  00:08:03,810
Another way of thinking about this is let's return that back.

123

00:08:04,050  -->  00:08:08,300
Another way of thinking about this is let's start off with undo whatever excelled at.

124

00:08:08,300  -->  00:08:12,060
So we're going to remove this quotation mark and we're going to remove this quotation mark and then

125

00:08:12,060  -->  00:08:16,270
we're going to remove this unqualified quotation mark of Excel.

126

00:08:16,500  -->  00:08:21,840
And so now you have the same result as you see here as in the original file and now we know how to fix

127

00:08:21,840  -->  00:08:24,760
the corruption we just need to put a quotation mark at the start over here.

128

00:08:25,110  -->  00:08:30,120
And therefore now this is all one phrase and will be treated as the feedback with the comment and will

129

00:08:30,120  -->  00:08:30,920
go here.

130

00:08:30,990  -->  00:08:36,690
And then the rest of the data will be aligned as great.

131

00:08:36,840  -->  00:08:39,480
That is how we fix up row number 96.

132

00:08:39,480  -->  00:08:45,510
By the way it's number 97 here because of the headers so in reality this is number 96 or record number

133

00:08:45,510  -->  00:08:46,740
number six.

134

00:08:46,740  -->  00:08:50,850
Now let's move up to record number 81 and see what we can do there.

135

00:08:50,850  -->  00:08:55,950
This one's a bit more interesting so we've got everyone over here.

136

00:08:55,950  -->  00:08:57,800
We've got 81 over here.

137

00:08:57,870  -->  00:08:58,710
What's going on.

138

00:08:58,710  -->  00:09:01,800
Let's move to the Calment or.

139

00:09:01,860  -->  00:09:09,090
Well first of all we can go to our society's package and have a look here just to make sure we know

140

00:09:09,090  -->  00:09:11,210
exactly where this is happening the era.

141

00:09:11,340  -->  00:09:16,710
So if we scroll this is 81 at the top we scroll scroll scroll and then we see that feedback and after

142

00:09:16,710  -->  00:09:22,350
that everything cuts off and inside feedback you've got this phrase nothing to complain about will recommend

143

00:09:22,350  -->  00:09:22,890
to my friends.

144

00:09:22,890  -->  00:09:23,610
Thanks.

145

00:09:23,640  -->  00:09:27,610
And then there's a comma there's a number and there is more.

146

00:09:27,660  -->  00:09:28,540
There's more numbers.

147

00:09:28,540  -->  00:09:31,800
Numbers number numbers and commas and so on.

148

00:09:31,800  -->  00:09:40,650
So basically everything there is supposed to be here in these columns and more is now inside this one

149

00:09:40,650  -->  00:09:41,660
column.

150

00:09:41,700  -->  00:09:44,520
So it kind of ate up all of the columns on the right.

151

00:09:44,730  -->  00:09:46,730
Let's see how that could have happened.

152

00:09:47,280  -->  00:09:50,760
So now we're in our row 81.

153

00:09:50,970  -->  00:09:53,500
Let's scroll to the right so we're here.

154

00:09:53,920  -->  00:09:55,650
And so what do we see.

155

00:09:55,660  -->  00:09:57,090
Nothing to complain about.

156

00:09:57,100  -->  00:10:00,260
This is the modified file the Excel one.

157

00:10:00,370  -->  00:10:01,550
Nothing to complain about.

158

00:10:01,600  -->  00:10:06,820
Then some more text and then has got some.

159

00:10:06,850  -->  00:10:14,230
One two three four more columns and then has got empty columns as got the quotation marks and then it's

160

00:10:14,230  -->  00:10:20,440
got a more quotation marks so a very interesting situation what happened here to understand better what

161

00:10:20,440  -->  00:10:20,790
happened.

162

00:10:20,800  -->  00:10:26,530
Always good to look at the original file once again don't open the original file copy it and then open

163

00:10:26,530  -->  00:10:28,330
it just to be safe.

164

00:10:28,330  -->  00:10:29,650
So here let's have a look.

165

00:10:29,640  -->  00:10:32,830
So you've got a quotation mark in the original file.

166

00:10:32,830  -->  00:10:36,220
Then you've got a comma will recommend to my friends.

167

00:10:36,220  -->  00:10:40,810
Thanks and then you've got another comment so the rest of the kind of information is starting over here

168

00:10:40,820  -->  00:10:41,020
.

169

00:10:41,080  -->  00:10:47,620
What happened there why why is the rest of the information starting here why is whereas this other quotation

170

00:10:47,620  -->  00:10:53,110
marks so you can see right away that this record is also corrupted because it is supposed to have a

171

00:10:53,110  -->  00:10:56,160
quotation mark on the end in the previous scenario.

172

00:10:56,170  -->  00:11:01,060
We lost the quotation mark at the start here you lost the British market then and this is much more

173

00:11:01,570  -->  00:11:06,870
dangerous what happens here is once a quotation mark is lost on the end.

174

00:11:06,880  -->  00:11:12,000
Excel thinks that everything after the quotation marks is still part of this record so it's expects

175

00:11:12,250  -->  00:11:19,630
that actually not excel SOSIAS will think that everything from there onwards will be part of this whole

176

00:11:19,620  -->  00:11:21,890
same text so it will expect a new crash.

177

00:11:21,920  -->  00:11:23,710
Will just keep going.

178

00:11:23,730  -->  00:11:29,250
I think that the cell keeps going and going and going until the next partition mark which can even be

179

00:11:29,250  -->  00:11:30,350
on the next line.

180

00:11:30,390  -->  00:11:36,730
So here another thing you can see is that the original file in this role was actually corrupted quite

181

00:11:36,730  -->  00:11:37,280
a lot.

182

00:11:37,500  -->  00:11:44,850
What happened is this Calment forget about the quotation mark there is should be a quotation mark here

183

00:11:45,190  -->  00:11:48,900
but irrespective of that we're expecting some more information.

184

00:11:48,910  -->  00:11:54,970
So off to the commons we we know we've got to have an email so just like here we've got an email address

185

00:11:55,240  -->  00:11:59,280
and then after that email address it should be like a log in or something like that than a password

186

00:11:59,290  -->  00:12:02,520
and then the type of browser the person is using and none of that is here.

187

00:12:02,520  -->  00:12:08,660
So here we only have 1 2 3 4 columns which look like columns from the very end.

188

00:12:08,670  -->  00:12:12,010
So here you've got these geographical coordinates.

189

00:12:12,010  -->  00:12:15,340
Then you've got some hash code and then you've got some.

190

00:12:15,340  -->  00:12:20,560
I don't at all like meters this is the height of the person because that's inches and if you go to the

191

00:12:20,560  -->  00:12:22,130
top of your file.

192

00:12:22,140  -->  00:12:24,410
This is the height in meters.

193

00:12:24,550  -->  00:12:29,220
So here you've got those four Combs from the end.

194

00:12:29,260  -->  00:12:32,630
Then here you're supposed to have like a lot more columns.

195

00:12:33,010  -->  00:12:39,570
But instead what this file has is has these empty columns so every time you have a column or after column

196

00:12:39,580  -->  00:12:41,380
column that means that there's nothing in that column.

197

00:12:41,380  -->  00:12:47,670
So basically Urooj in the original file the last four columns got shifted over here and everything after

198

00:12:47,680  -->  00:12:48,490
that got deleted.

199

00:12:48,490  -->  00:12:54,370
So it looks like there was a huge mess up and these two issues are not related all they don't.

200

00:12:54,550  -->  00:12:59,620
They're not supposed to be related so when there's no quotation mark here on there not necessarily all

201

00:12:59,620  -->  00:13:04,340
the other columns officer it gets destroyed.

202

00:13:04,360  -->  00:13:10,270
This is just an anomaly that happened here specifically so you will find situations further down the

203

00:13:10,270  -->  00:13:16,210
track where you still have this question mark at the start and there are no quotation marks at the end

204

00:13:16,240  -->  00:13:18,910
and the other columns are still alive so they are still there.

205

00:13:18,900  -->  00:13:21,350
In this case those like major corruption.

206

00:13:21,390  -->  00:13:27,220
This is one of those anomalies that you can't really fix you've got excluded from the file and reported

207

00:13:27,220  -->  00:13:29,000
or investigated separately.

208

00:13:29,260  -->  00:13:30,940
But now let's look at what happened over here.

209

00:13:30,940  -->  00:13:35,860
So here we've got in the prepared file.

210

00:13:35,920  -->  00:13:38,410
That's after all manipulations with Excel.

211

00:13:38,500  -->  00:13:40,730
You've got that quotation mark.

212

00:13:40,750  -->  00:13:42,190
Excel kept it.

213

00:13:42,190  -->  00:13:44,640
And then what happens is you've got the text.

214

00:13:45,010  -->  00:13:50,600
Then you've got your 3 or 4 anomalies so the columns disappear just like here so they're not there.

215

00:13:50,740  -->  00:13:51,850
That's fine.

216

00:13:51,850  -->  00:13:56,180
Then you've got your empty columns just the same amount as over here and there.

217

00:13:56,200  -->  00:13:58,930
What Excel did after that.

218

00:13:58,930  -->  00:14:01,480
Is it actually put a quotation mark for you.

219

00:14:01,480  -->  00:14:08,620
Because Excel you might imagine what excelsis excelsis this and then it's expecting more columns.

220

00:14:08,620  -->  00:14:12,310
So right now there's no qualifying symbol so for Excel.

221

00:14:12,310  -->  00:14:15,280
This all of this once once you open it up in Excel.

222

00:14:15,280  -->  00:14:20,890
All of this is actually one huge cell and then it's expecting more columns.

223

00:14:21,280  -->  00:14:23,920
And so what Excel did is it kind of.

224

00:14:23,950  -->  00:14:25,430
It's quite smart in this way.

225

00:14:25,480  -->  00:14:30,300
It helps you prevent an even bigger mistake or bigger data error.

226

00:14:30,630  -->  00:14:36,610
Here what happens is it put a quotation mark after the end and then it puts these actual empty columns

227

00:14:36,610  -->  00:14:45,330
so filled the rest of the gaps with empty columns for you so that your file has a consistent structure

228

00:14:45,340  -->  00:14:47,680
so every single row has the same number of columns.

229

00:14:47,690  -->  00:14:53,400
That's just how Excel works and works with tables you can have a table where there's not enough columns

230

00:14:53,830  -->  00:14:55,680
so that is what it did.

231

00:14:55,810  -->  00:15:01,990
If you were to try and upload the original file before our manipulations in Excel so if all this magical

232

00:15:01,990  -->  00:15:09,550
benefit that Excel happened to give us which we didn't even know about right for if we filed this if

233

00:15:09,550  -->  00:15:15,220
you tried to upload this file what will happen is you've got this opening quotation mark right.

234

00:15:15,220  -->  00:15:19,780
This is very interesting actually that you got the opening quotation mark and then it keeps going.

235

00:15:19,780  -->  00:15:25,360
So this is all one cell as I'm highlighting this is all one cell for Sosias the Sosias were to look

236

00:15:25,360  -->  00:15:26,160
at this file.

237

00:15:26,160  -->  00:15:27,480
This is all one cell.

238

00:15:27,490  -->  00:15:32,830
This is still one cell with lots of coma's which are qualified because of quotation marks or qualified

239

00:15:32,830  -->  00:15:33,400
symbol.

240

00:15:33,430  -->  00:15:40,530
It gets to the end for SSA as even this carriage return line feed symbol over here it still qualified

241

00:15:40,540  -->  00:15:44,580
so it's within the quotation marks so as Assayas would continue on it would say.

242

00:15:44,590  -->  00:15:47,810
OK so this is still part of that same column.

243

00:15:47,990  -->  00:15:52,920
OK and then it gets to the quotation mark and then it says or writes so that is where I sell ends.

244

00:15:52,960  -->  00:15:59,350
So all of this information would be actually sitting in this one cell over here and then the best part

245

00:15:59,350  -->  00:16:01,420
is then this would be the next cell.

246

00:16:01,410  -->  00:16:03,730
This would be the next cell up to here.

247

00:16:03,730  -->  00:16:09,090
Remember that issue that you discussed so that's a quotation mark at the end it doesn't really for a

248

00:16:09,090  -->  00:16:09,530
sucess.

249

00:16:09,530  -->  00:16:10,570
It doesn't really do much.

250

00:16:10,570  -->  00:16:15,550
It's like the quotation mark has to be at the start of the column to be an opening qualifier so that

251

00:16:15,550  -->  00:16:16,290
would be the next cell.

252

00:16:16,300  -->  00:16:17,510
This is still in.

253

00:16:17,590  -->  00:16:22,600
This is still in row 81 so a row 82 would be completely gobbled up by row 81.

254

00:16:22,600  -->  00:16:24,180
This would be the next cell and so on.

255

00:16:24,190  -->  00:16:32,690
So a huge huge huge mess up until Sosias gets to the end of this row where this carriage return line

256

00:16:33,070  -->  00:16:38,410
feed symbol is not qualified and therefore it will recognize 83 as a separate row.

257

00:16:38,400  -->  00:16:44,860
So basically what would have happened is these two rows would have been combined into one and only normal

258

00:16:44,880  -->  00:16:46,800
upload would continue from royalty 3.

259

00:16:46,840  -->  00:16:49,950
So even if was not knowing it.

260

00:16:50,020  -->  00:16:52,120
Excel actually did us a favor.

261

00:16:52,120  -->  00:16:59,050
Here it protected the rest of our file from continuous corruption by placing this quotation mark here

262

00:16:59,050  -->  00:17:02,350
and stopping from the rest of the rows being.

263

00:17:02,760  -->  00:17:06,200
Or the next draw being gobbled up into this row.

264

00:17:06,280  -->  00:17:09,130
So even though we have 1 corruption in row 8 you want.

265

00:17:09,120  -->  00:17:15,840
It has been stopped so this has been quite a quite a long tutorial but I hope you understand these things

266

00:17:15,850  -->  00:17:23,490
because as a data scientist you will be dealing quite a lot with C S V files and comma separated and

267

00:17:23,870  -->  00:17:25,940
tabulated files and so on.

268

00:17:26,080  -->  00:17:31,840
You will need to know what Tex qualifiers are and this is a great great example of how they work and

269

00:17:31,840  -->  00:17:36,840
how corruption can really damage your the integrity of your file.

270

00:17:36,850  -->  00:17:40,760
So what are we going to do here is we're not going to.

271

00:17:41,020  -->  00:17:41,470
We're not.

272

00:17:41,470  -->  00:17:46,780
We're not going to do any modifications to this slide because obviously we don't have this data we don't

273

00:17:46,870  -->  00:17:48,390
know how to return it.

274

00:17:48,390  -->  00:17:55,480
The only thing we can do is exclude it completely from our analysis and not uploaded and but we definitely

275

00:17:55,470  -->  00:18:01,430
have to still keep it for all records and I'll show you how to do that in the next tutorial.
