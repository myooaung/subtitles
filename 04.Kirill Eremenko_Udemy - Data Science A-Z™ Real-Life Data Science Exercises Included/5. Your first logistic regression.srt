00:00:00,440  -->  00:00:06,060
In the previous tutorial we had quite a lot of theory about logistic regression and even though we were

2

00:00:06,060  -->  00:00:12,290
talking about intuition of the logistic regression we had to look at a few formals anyway.

3

00:00:12,420  -->  00:00:16,070
So today it's time to make up for that with some practice.

4

00:00:16,290  -->  00:00:20,700
And finally today we're going to build our very first logistic regression.

5

00:00:20,700  -->  00:00:22,120
I hope you're excited.

6

00:00:22,620  -->  00:00:27,320
So here I've got Grinnel opened up and a very loaded the data set which is e-mail offer.

7

00:00:27,360  -->  00:00:35,190
And I have even created two dummy variables for the gender categorical independent variables so please

8

00:00:35,190  -->  00:00:36,720
go ahead and do that.

9

00:00:36,990  -->  00:00:42,570
And once you've done that we will start creating the model in order to create a logistic regression

10

00:00:42,570  -->  00:00:50,910
model you need to go to model and then go to limited dependent variable and then go to logit and then

11

00:00:50,910  -->  00:00:52,590
go to binary.

12

00:00:52,770  -->  00:00:59,640
And so here you need to take your binary dependent variable into and put it into the dependent variable

13

00:01:00,930  -->  00:01:06,680
option and also that set as default because you'll need to rerun this model in a bit.

14

00:01:06,810  -->  00:01:09,560
And we're just going to run the model with one variable.

15

00:01:09,560  -->  00:01:12,830
We're only going to use age so we won't worry about gender at this stage.

16

00:01:13,110  -->  00:01:19,290
And before you click ok make sure to change show slopes that mean to show p values because we are used

17

00:01:19,290  -->  00:01:21,960
to using p values and we'll continue doing that.

18

00:01:21,990  -->  00:01:23,210
So click OK.

19

00:01:23,400  -->  00:01:24,690
And there you go that's your model.

20

00:01:24,690  -->  00:01:25,440
It's been run.

21

00:01:25,440  -->  00:01:27,980
It's ready as you can see it's very similar.

22

00:01:27,990  -->  00:01:34,740
So here you've got your Similar to go just to the linear regression here you've got two variables there

23

00:01:34,750  -->  00:01:36,930
are efficient and p values.

24

00:01:36,930  -->  00:01:43,650
Here you've got some stats about the model as how it's running how it's been fitted and so on and some

25

00:01:43,830  -->  00:01:48,330
additional information at the bottom which we won't worry about right now but we will get back to it

26

00:01:48,330  -->  00:01:50,010
after we're more comfortable.

27

00:01:50,010  -->  00:01:58,950
The confusion matrix Now what I would like us to do is to look at the graph the charts of the logistic

28

00:01:58,950  -->  00:02:02,740
regression which we spoke in-depth about in the previous detail.

29

00:02:02,760  -->  00:02:09,820
So just go to graphs and then go to fitted actual plot and select the one which is against age.

30

00:02:10,260  -->  00:02:13,910
And here you can see the logistic regression graph.

31

00:02:14,070  -->  00:02:16,160
It's exactly the one we talked about previously.

32

00:02:16,230  -->  00:02:23,100
So vaguely at the bottom at the top you can see the actual observations there be imploded in red and

33

00:02:23,100  -->  00:02:29,510
in blue you can see the chart for the logistic regression or the life logistic regression.

34

00:02:29,520  -->  00:02:31,860
So let's take a random age here.

35

00:02:31,860  -->  00:02:36,430
So for instance for age 39 which is over here you've got some verbals.

36

00:02:36,460  -->  00:02:40,670
You've got a variable over here you go to a red line and you go red line over there so some people did

37

00:02:40,680  -->  00:02:42,750
take up the offer some people didn't.

38

00:02:43,140  -->  00:02:48,510
But according to our model anybody who's at age 39 their probability of taking up the offer is about

39

00:02:48,510  -->  00:02:49,690
30 percent.

40

00:02:49,710  -->  00:02:54,060
So it kind of makes sense right even if the probability is 30 percent.

41

00:02:54,060  -->  00:02:59,040
Some people most people probably won't take up the offer without probability but some people still will

42

00:02:59,050  -->  00:03:02,170
and that gives credit to our moral.

43

00:03:02,340  -->  00:03:07,330
All right so now we're going to close that up and we're going to move this model to the side and will

44

00:03:07,370  -->  00:03:11,130
run a new model with the second variable included.

45

00:03:11,130  -->  00:03:18,110
So let's go ahead and do that model limited dependent variables logit binary.

46

00:03:18,510  -->  00:03:23,640
And here just add in your new variable in this case you can add male or female.

47

00:03:23,640  -->  00:03:24,810
Doesn't really matter.

48

00:03:24,810  -->  00:03:29,840
We're going to add male and then just click OK and here we'll look at the chart.

49

00:03:29,850  -->  00:03:31,230
But we'll do that later.

50

00:03:31,260  -->  00:03:34,410
For now let's look at something else.

51

00:03:34,410  -->  00:03:36,160
Let's go to analysis.

52

00:03:36,180  -->  00:03:39,110
Go for costs I referred for causing anything.

53

00:03:39,120  -->  00:03:43,240
Let's just run the model and see what the results will be.

54

00:03:43,620  -->  00:03:52,860
So here what you get is a table which includes your actual took action or didn't take action variable

55

00:03:52,860  -->  00:03:58,020
or dependent variable so you know what the result was and you have the prediction for the same person

56

00:03:58,490  -->  00:04:02,210
here it only has the wrong numbers or doesn't have the gender or age.

57

00:04:02,400  -->  00:04:09,000
And that's not very convenient So what are we going to do is we're going to save this new variable by

58

00:04:09,000  -->  00:04:12,780
creating the plus up over here and right away gives it a name.

59

00:04:12,780  -->  00:04:19,980
So the name is quite funny in this case it's as took a hat and that's just just a because it abbreviated

60

00:04:19,980  -->  00:04:23,850
or shortened our variable.

61

00:04:23,850  -->  00:04:26,280
The name of the variable took action.

62

00:04:26,280  -->  00:04:28,760
So we're going to say took action underscore that.

63

00:04:29,010  -->  00:04:32,100
And as you recall this is exactly what we were talking about previously.

64

00:04:32,210  -->  00:04:34,080
Hat means prediction.

65

00:04:34,080  -->  00:04:38,870
So this is OUR a white hat that we looked at in the previous tutorial.

66

00:04:38,910  -->  00:04:44,330
So if we click OK now we can close this and leave the mall open just move to the side.

67

00:04:44,880  -->  00:04:47,280
You can see that a new variable has been added to the data.

68

00:04:47,340  -->  00:04:53,400
Took action underscore hat and now we can have a look at all of them together so just highlight the

69

00:04:53,400  -->  00:04:54,550
variables.

70

00:04:54,780  -->  00:04:57,530
And as you can see the dummies won't be highlighted that way.

71

00:04:57,550  -->  00:05:03,260
Well if you keep this closed so the dummies are not highlighted which is good.

72

00:05:03,570  -->  00:05:08,890
And we go to you or no let's go to Dora display values.

73

00:05:08,910  -->  00:05:12,890
So here now you can see more information.

74

00:05:12,890  -->  00:05:17,650
You can see the age the gender of the person and whether or not they took action and took action.

75

00:05:17,670  -->  00:05:21,500
So let's have a look at a couple of examples here and why we're doing this well.

76

00:05:21,750  -->  00:05:26,190
I'd like you to be a bit more prepared for the next tutorial when we're talking about false positives

77

00:05:26,280  -->  00:05:27,380
and false negatives.

78

00:05:27,380  -->  00:05:33,110
And if we look at this now it will make more sense what we're talking about in the next toilet.

79

00:05:33,180  -->  00:05:40,710
So age this person the first row person the first row was 38 female.

80

00:05:40,710  -->  00:05:42,420
They didn't take up action.

81

00:05:42,450  -->  00:05:46,560
And what our model actually predicted for them is a 1 percent chance of taking action.

82

00:05:46,620  -->  00:05:47,160
So that's good.

83

00:05:47,160  -->  00:05:52,560
So basically means that our model is in line with not taking action.

84

00:05:52,560  -->  00:05:59,210
Next person 32 female didn't take up action and particular very low value which is good.

85

00:05:59,220  -->  00:06:03,270
Next person 46 male took action.

86

00:06:03,270  -->  00:06:03,850
Yes.

87

00:06:03,870  -->  00:06:07,650
And our model predicted a ninety nine point nine percent chance of taking action.

88

00:06:07,650  -->  00:06:08,670
Great.

89

00:06:08,700  -->  00:06:12,150
Next person 34 male didn't take action.

90

00:06:12,150  -->  00:06:16,410
Our model predicted a 2.7 percent chance good so so far so good.

91

00:06:16,440  -->  00:06:19,980
Next person for the male did not take action.

92

00:06:20,010  -->  00:06:24,600
But our model predicted an 85 percent chance of them taking action.

93

00:06:24,600  -->  00:06:35,670
So here you can see that our model made an error if we applied that logic where we derive though why

94

00:06:35,670  -->  00:06:41,610
had value so this is the probability of we derived the Y had value so that 1 or 0 and we use the 50

95

00:06:41,610  -->  00:06:43,200
percent line for us.

96

00:06:43,200  -->  00:06:48,980
This would mean that the person is predicted to take action but in reality they didn't take action.

97

00:06:48,990  -->  00:06:54,010
There is a zero here meaning that they ignore the offer.

98

00:06:54,030  -->  00:06:59,010
So this is an example of when a logistic regression makes an error and that's fine.

99

00:06:59,010  -->  00:07:00,200
This is normal.

100

00:07:00,420  -->  00:07:06,160
No model in the world will always predict 100 percent correctly once in a while errors will be made

101

00:07:06,160  -->  00:07:06,180
.

102

00:07:06,180  -->  00:07:10,770
It's about controlling users and making sure there isn't too many of them and we'll talk about errors

103

00:07:11,010  -->  00:07:12,870
a bit more in the next tutorial.

104

00:07:13,020  -->  00:07:16,950
So that's what I wanted to show you over here.

105

00:07:17,100  -->  00:07:21,090
That's pretty much it's for this tutorial.

106

00:07:21,090  -->  00:07:28,050
The last thing I want to show you was the chart for the model with two variables.

107

00:07:28,050  -->  00:07:30,720
So let's go ahead and look at it now.

108

00:07:31,040  -->  00:07:37,660
I go to graphs and I got fitted versus actual plot and I plot against age.

109

00:07:38,370  -->  00:07:40,400
What you'll see here is a bit of a different picture.

110

00:07:40,410  -->  00:07:47,600
And you see here two of the sigmoid functions or two of the logistic regression curves.

111

00:07:47,940  -->  00:07:54,550
And the question is question of the day is why is there two occurs and I'll let you think about that

112

00:07:54,780  -->  00:07:55,260
on your own.

113

00:07:55,260  -->  00:08:01,260
So it's a little challenge for you to figure out why there is two curves on this chart and I look for

114

00:08:01,370  -->  00:08:02,220
the next time.

115

00:08:02,250  -->  00:08:03,590
Until then happy analyzing
