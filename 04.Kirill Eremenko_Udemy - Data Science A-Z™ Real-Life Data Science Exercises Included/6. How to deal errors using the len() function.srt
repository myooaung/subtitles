1

00:00:01,050  -->  00:00:05,320
Previously on House of Cards you saw how to deal with the numeric error.

2

00:00:05,580  -->  00:00:06,990
I'm joking.

3

00:00:07,200  -->  00:00:13,560
We pray it previously we in our course Brucey you know a science course we learned how to deal with

4

00:00:14,340  -->  00:00:16,140
errors where a

5

00:00:18,480  -->  00:00:26,710
supposedly numerical value is not conforming with the format of an American value and we use the ISM

6

00:00:26,910  -->  00:00:33,700
function to figure out what it is and we found that in our balance column we had a lot of whoops where

7

00:00:33,790  -->  00:00:34,980
is the balance column.

8

00:00:35,010  -->  00:00:37,110
We had a lot of anomalies.

9

00:00:37,140  -->  00:00:45,330
So 10 anomalies and then used in the metric function in its inverse version where it is equal to want

10

00:00:45,330  -->  00:00:52,290
to exclude these rows from our insert and now we're faced of another era where a string of binary data

11

00:00:52,290  -->  00:00:53,670
would be truncated.

12

00:00:53,730  -->  00:01:00,040
So something is getting cut off and I'll show you a quick trick to that.

13

00:01:00,090  -->  00:01:01,470
That'll fix this error right away.

14

00:01:01,470  -->  00:01:07,410
I'm just going to take this and I'm going to replace it with 10 and let's let's do this again so we'll

15

00:01:07,440  -->  00:01:08,770
recreate the table.

16

00:01:09,040  -->  00:01:13,060
And so now we're saying in the zip code you can have up to 10 characters.

17

00:01:13,230  -->  00:01:13,980
Interesting.

18

00:01:13,980  -->  00:01:15,120
What's going to happen.

19

00:01:15,150  -->  00:01:19,000
We don't really need to truncated because there's nothing in there anyway.

20

00:01:19,740  -->  00:01:22,750
So now we execute.

21

00:01:23,150  -->  00:01:24,640
Ha ha.

22

00:01:24,710  -->  00:01:26,810
And now we have a different area.

23

00:01:26,940  -->  00:01:33,470
Carroll has put in so many errors into this one single file right.

24

00:01:33,510  -->  00:01:37,300
But anyway what's what we achieved is we got rid of that era.

25

00:01:37,320  -->  00:01:38,460
What does that tell us.

26

00:01:38,640  -->  00:01:45,060
That tells us that in the zip code there was a value at least one value that was longer than seven characters

27

00:01:45,420  -->  00:01:47,640
and it was being truncated.

28

00:01:47,640  -->  00:01:52,710
And so what happened is our quality assurance mechanism worked.

29

00:01:52,710  -->  00:02:00,120
We put in seven here to prevent anything beyond certain characters to be being inserted into this table

30

00:02:00,810  -->  00:02:04,180
because we know that the zip code has to be 7 and if it's more than 7 then it's an error.

31

00:02:04,380  -->  00:02:12,810
And it did error out so we called an error that way and now it's up to us to get rid of the error and

32

00:02:12,810  -->  00:02:13,630
not insert it.

33

00:02:13,650  -->  00:02:15,770
So we'll execute that.

34

00:02:16,080  -->  00:02:18,170
And here I'll show a different approach.

35

00:02:18,180  -->  00:02:24,460
So selects are from the same table.

36

00:02:24,960  -->  00:02:29,170
Where and what is all culms zipcode.

37

00:02:29,160  -->  00:02:30,570
And we know that it's a text column right.

38

00:02:30,570  -->  00:02:38,120
So how we look at it's length right length is greater than 7.

39

00:02:38,130  -->  00:02:40,540
So let's see what we pick up that way.

40

00:02:41,110  -->  00:02:43,650
Aha there's two rows.

41

00:02:43,920  -->  00:02:49,200
You see this zipcode there's an X or symbol is a W on the end and there's this SuperCoach there's a

42

00:02:49,200  -->  00:02:54,750
one on the end and I'm actually using that analysis.

43

00:02:54,810  -->  00:02:57,970
I'm guess I'm doing analysis liberally very liberally.

44

00:02:58,050  -->  00:03:03,360
You can't really say that this is the symbol that's not supposed to be there that you're the one.

45

00:03:03,510  -->  00:03:09,750
Maybe somebody put an extra five in the middle or the KS and supposed to be all the C's and supposed

46

00:03:09,750  -->  00:03:11,460
to be there and everything is double up.

47

00:03:11,470  -->  00:03:18,120
Maybe this is completely wrong value that's not even related to zip code so if you if you are thinking

48

00:03:18,120  -->  00:03:22,500
of fixing this manually because the rest of the roll looks good right you think you are fixing this

49

00:03:22,500  -->  00:03:26,190
man by just removing one letter from the end.

50

00:03:26,190  -->  00:03:33,070
I would think again I would seriously consider taking this data back to where it came from because there's

51

00:03:33,090  -->  00:03:38,120
obviously an error or at least excluding this column from analysis if you don't need it.

52

00:03:38,490  -->  00:03:44,730
So always be careful with manually fixing things because then the responsibility is on you that you're

53

00:03:44,730  -->  00:03:48,380
100 percent sure that that is the correct way to fix it anyway.

54

00:03:48,510  -->  00:03:48,980
Going back.

55

00:03:48,990  -->  00:03:51,900
So that's how we exclude these columns.

56

00:03:51,900  -->  00:03:52,330
These are all.

57

00:03:52,330  -->  00:03:58,620
So how about now we take this filter.

58

00:03:58,620  -->  00:04:06,780
So we'll take Len zipcode Greg and so on we added into our filters and then zip code regrind 7.

59

00:04:06,780  -->  00:04:09,900
So here we're going to have to say how many rows were excluded.

60

00:04:10,680  -->  00:04:16,520
And you intuitively you want to put two rows here right two rows excluded.

61

00:04:16,890  -->  00:04:18,680
However that might not be the case.

62

00:04:18,750  -->  00:04:20,430
And let me explain why.

63

00:04:20,430  -->  00:04:23,380
Because we're really excluding some rows here.

64

00:04:23,860  -->  00:04:26,220
And what if one of the rows are excluded.

65

00:04:26,220  -->  00:04:31,020
Here is also That's the row here.

66

00:04:31,050  -->  00:04:32,030
One of the rows here.

67

00:04:32,160  -->  00:04:37,160
So in that way you if you put in two rows here then you're double counting.

68

00:04:37,170  -->  00:04:40,310
You've excluded it here and then as if you excluded here.

69

00:04:40,320  -->  00:04:42,000
But it doesn't even get to this stage.

70

00:04:42,000  -->  00:04:46,020
So these filters work you know like one up to the other.

71

00:04:46,020  -->  00:04:52,260
So remember that the total of the rows you excluded Plus the rows affected should give you the total

72

00:04:52,350  -->  00:04:54,930
of the rows in Europhile and that is important.

73

00:04:54,930  -->  00:04:58,450
That is your quality assurance check so don't rush this.

74

00:04:58,870  -->  00:05:04,170
Let's just what we do what you need to do is the proper way of doing it is you obviously truncate table

75

00:05:04,170  -->  00:05:09,000
insert and you execute well.

76

00:05:09,030  -->  00:05:15,500
Here you can't you can't tell because because nothing has been inserted.

77

00:05:15,510  -->  00:05:22,110
Normally what you do is you add subtract the difference of how you go to insert in this case and then

78

00:05:22,270  -->  00:05:24,860
you go to insert in this case and you would see how many rows.

79

00:05:25,110  -->  00:05:27,060
But obviously in this case you can't do that.

80

00:05:27,060  -->  00:05:32,480
So the only other option we have is we have to check so we can see that balance here is OK.

81

00:05:32,490  -->  00:05:41,650
So in this case we can say that two two rows have been excluded.

82

00:05:41,760  -->  00:05:45,520
The other way you would do it is you would you look at this file right so you would say.

83

00:05:45,810  -->  00:05:52,410
All right all of this part I would say I would first apply this filter I would say all right where is

84

00:05:52,410  -->  00:05:55,760
numeric is equal to 1.

85

00:05:55,890  -->  00:05:56,160
Right.

86

00:05:56,160  -->  00:06:01,720
So that excludes those 10 rows and then apply this filter.

87

00:06:01,860  -->  00:06:08,100
So and then let's see how many of the remaining actually are nonconforming with the format of the zipcode

88

00:06:08,130  -->  00:06:09,020
and it's still true.

89

00:06:09,030  -->  00:06:09,330
OK.

90

00:06:09,330  -->  00:06:14,680
So in that case you can say there are two rows and probably less Let's keep doing it this way.

91

00:06:14,710  -->  00:06:24,670
So next next time next time when we build something the next filter we will add onto this and then add

92

00:06:24,680  -->  00:06:25,800
on again again again.

93

00:06:25,830  -->  00:06:29,100
So that way we'll have the correct number of rows are excluding.

94

00:06:29,580  -->  00:06:34,530
All right so that's how you deal with nonconformity of rolls.

95

00:06:34,560  -->  00:06:40,290
So teks columns that are turning into tech Skolem's that are staying text columns but they have to have

96

00:06:40,290  -->  00:06:42,480
a certain format so they have to have seven symbols.

97

00:06:42,480  -->  00:06:46,840
For example we will learn how to investigate zip code even further.

98

00:06:46,860  -->  00:06:52,220
And you know special CRN formats of accommodation further down the track in this section.

99

00:06:52,380  -->  00:06:56,040
But for now we're faced with string or binary data would be truncated.

100

00:06:56,040  -->  00:07:00,930
Well that's that's basically this error because we said is greater than 7.

101

00:07:01,050  -->  00:07:03,450
You have to always do the opposite.

102

00:07:03,450  -->  00:07:05,080
Is less or equal to.

103

00:07:05,070  -->  00:07:06,460
And don't forget the equal.

104

00:07:06,510  -->  00:07:10,520
So the opposite of greater is less or equal to 7.

105

00:07:10,530  -->  00:07:12,290
So we want to keep only these rows.

106

00:07:12,300  -->  00:07:15,080
So let's do that again.

107

00:07:15,520  -->  00:07:18,890
Drumroll and execute.

108

00:07:19,110  -->  00:07:20,960
All right there we go.

109

00:07:20,960  -->  00:07:27,600
So now we have a new era conversion failed when converting and date and or time from character string

110

00:07:27,610  -->  00:07:28,080
.

111

00:07:28,530  -->  00:07:30,450
So that's a datum issue.

112

00:07:30,930  -->  00:07:36,300
We will look at this area in the next tutorial and I'll look forward to seeing you there.
