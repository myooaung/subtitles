00:00:02.160  -->  00:00:03.320
Hello and welcome back.

2

00:00:03.360  -->  00:00:09.540
And today we're talking about types of joins now joins operations that are performed on tables in relational

3

00:00:09.540  -->  00:00:10.650
databases.

4

00:00:10.650  -->  00:00:14.200
So you would perform them in a secure realm.

5

00:00:14.220  -->  00:00:23.070
Microsoft QOL and Oracle and my skill in many different platforms where the data is stored in a structured

6

00:00:23.280  -->  00:00:23.940
format.

7

00:00:24.090  -->  00:00:29.550
So let's have a look at some Joines and understand how exactly they work to start off with.

8

00:00:29.550  -->  00:00:32.770
Let's assume that we have two tables table A and Table B.

9

00:00:32.970  -->  00:00:36.370
And in our example table A will have the following rows.

10

00:00:36.390  -->  00:00:37.980
It's got three columns.

11

00:00:37.980  -->  00:00:43.550
Customer gender and age and is basically a table that is describing our customers.

12

00:00:43.560  -->  00:00:44.940
So we've got five customers.

13

00:00:44.940  -->  00:00:51.200
Adam Benjamin Jack Nick and Susan we've got their genders listed and their ages.

14

00:00:51.210  -->  00:00:57.360
Now if we go to Table B it's a table of employees of a certain store of our store basically.

15

00:00:57.360  -->  00:01:01.010
So it's got the employee name the title and the wage.

16

00:01:01.080  -->  00:01:06.750
And so what are we going to try and do and we're going to try and find out which of our customers are

17

00:01:06.840  -->  00:01:15.420
also our employees so basically where where do we have matching rows in these two tables and how are

18

00:01:15.430  -->  00:01:17.040
we going to do that.

19

00:01:17.040  -->  00:01:21.630
Well basically if we look at the tables we can see right away that Jack and Susan both appear in the

20

00:01:21.630  -->  00:01:24.420
customer and in the employee tables.

21

00:01:24.420  -->  00:01:30.990
So how do we do this from an upscale perspective or basically from a jointing perspective.

22

00:01:31.080  -->  00:01:37.360
Well if we start off with an inner join then let's have a look at how it will work.

23

00:01:37.380  -->  00:01:44.250
An inner join will take the two tables and it will look at only their intersect.

24

00:01:44.250  -->  00:01:51.790
So basically if we're joining our tables on customer equals employee then and it's an inner join.

25

00:01:51.790  -->  00:01:55.170
Then the remaining rows will only be the matching rows.

26

00:01:55.170  -->  00:02:01.950
So in this case Jack is matched with Jack and Susan is matched with Susan because we're just looking

27

00:02:01.950  -->  00:02:06.560
at the customer column in the left table and at the Embley you call them the right table.

28

00:02:06.570  -->  00:02:12.990
So once at Matching is done the rest of the rows which haven't matched are discarded and the remaining

29

00:02:12.990  -->  00:02:14.060
table looks like this.

30

00:02:14.070  -->  00:02:19.280
So it only has those rows that match and kind of glues them together and that's it.

31

00:02:19.290  -->  00:02:24.360
That's what's the result of an inner join on these two tables would look like.

32

00:02:24.360  -->  00:02:26.280
Now let's have a look at the left join.

33

00:02:26.280  -->  00:02:28.050
So there's a few different types of joins.

34

00:02:28.050  -->  00:02:32.640
Now we're going to proceed to the next one was called a left outer join and uncharted can also be called

35

00:02:32.640  -->  00:02:33.460
the left join.

36

00:02:33.570  -->  00:02:38.280
So Elif joined basically says that the primary table is the one on the left.

37

00:02:38.280  -->  00:02:44.010
Once again we're joining on the first column of the first table customer equals to the first column

38

00:02:44.010  -->  00:02:45.660
or the second table.

39

00:02:45.660  -->  00:02:46.980
Ours is in play.

40

00:02:46.980  -->  00:02:54.600
And since the Left table is a primary one rose cannot be discarded from the left table rows will only

41

00:02:54.600  -->  00:02:59.090
be discarded from the non-primary table so here Jack is matched with Jack.

42

00:02:59.090  -->  00:03:01.080
Susan is matched with Susan again.

43

00:03:01.080  -->  00:03:05.920
And then the rest of the rows in the second table are discarded because they didn't have a match.

44

00:03:06.090  -->  00:03:11.730
And so the resulting table will look like this where there was a match the rows are glued together.

45

00:03:11.880  -->  00:03:19.620
And where there was no match the associated columns left blank or some in the SPL.

46

00:03:19.620  -->  00:03:22.240
Basically those columns will be nolde.

47

00:03:22.260  -->  00:03:24.520
So let's just keep them blank for now.

48

00:03:24.930  -->  00:03:26.500
That's whole left join works.

49

00:03:26.700  -->  00:03:33.240
And basically the main idea here is that the table on the left of the join is considered to be the primary

50

00:03:33.240  -->  00:03:36.690
table and therefore rows cannot be discarded from the table.

51

00:03:36.690  -->  00:03:42.630
Now let's have a look at a right join a right join works in a very similar way but on this in this case

52

00:03:42.630  -->  00:03:45.120
the table on the right is the primary table.

53

00:03:45.120  -->  00:03:46.800
So once again Jack is matched to Jack.

54

00:03:46.800  -->  00:03:53.980
Susan is much to Susan and the rest of the rows in the left table are discarded because it is the secondary

55

00:03:54.000  -->  00:03:57.210
table it's not the primary rows in the primary table.

56

00:03:57.240  -->  00:03:59.310
On the other hand cannot be discarded.

57

00:03:59.310  -->  00:04:02.960
So the final result here is a table which looks like this.

58

00:04:02.970  -->  00:04:07.830
Once again the two sets of columns have been glued together and where there was no match on the left

59

00:04:08.360  -->  00:04:11.810
and the values in the columns are left blank or Lord.

60

00:04:12.090  -->  00:04:14.870
And finally let's have a look at a full outer join.

61

00:04:14.880  -->  00:04:20.370
So in a full outer join we'll looking at the union of the two tables or better probably unions is not

62

00:04:20.370  -->  00:04:21.080
the right word.

63

00:04:21.090  -->  00:04:27.600
We're looking at all of the rows in the two tables and that's why you see those those two circles in

64

00:04:27.600  -->  00:04:31.600
the Venn diagram up at the top of full the yellow.

65

00:04:31.830  -->  00:04:37.280
And that means that we cannot discard or the join will not discard any of the rows in any of the two

66

00:04:37.280  -->  00:04:38.600
tables.

67

00:04:38.640  -->  00:04:41.700
Once again we're looking for matches So Jack is matched with Jack.

68

00:04:41.700  -->  00:04:43.400
Susan is Mashrafe Susan.

69

00:04:43.410  -->  00:04:47.850
And then what happens is no rows are discarded and the tables are glued together.

70

00:04:47.850  -->  00:04:49.950
And that is what the final result looks like.

71

00:04:49.950  -->  00:04:56.250
So on the right there is blank spaces where there was no match to the table on the left and on the left

72

00:04:56.250  -->  00:04:59.520
there is blank spaces where there was no match to the table on the right.

73

00:04:59.520  -->  00:05:05.290
So once again I'll just go back to the previous slide and here you will see the two table separately

74

00:05:06.270  -->  00:05:08.320
and now off to the join.

75

00:05:08.370  -->  00:05:11.460
This is what the final table will look like.

76

00:05:11.460  -->  00:05:14.450
So that's how a full outer join works.

77

00:05:14.550  -->  00:05:18.810
And now let's just quickly recap on the types of drawings that we discussed.

78

00:05:18.810  -->  00:05:25.830
So we had a look at four different joins the inner join which only looks at the matching rows.

79

00:05:26.130  -->  00:05:32.790
The Left join which keeps the left the table on the left as a primary table the right join which keeps

80

00:05:32.790  -->  00:05:38.880
the table in the right as the primary table and the full join or the full outer join which does not

81

00:05:38.880  -->  00:05:39.340
discard.

82

00:05:39.390  -->  00:05:41.080
And euros from any of the tables.

83

00:05:41.370  -->  00:05:48.390
So in your work you're probably going to be using inner joins and left joins mostly and that is because

84

00:05:48.390  -->  00:05:55.020
right joins are rarely used simply because are-I join is the same as a left join just the tables you

85

00:05:55.020  -->  00:05:57.330
just have to switch the tables around.

86

00:05:57.330  -->  00:06:00.960
So put the one on the right on the left and the one that was on the left on the right and you'll get

87

00:06:00.960  -->  00:06:02.160
a left join again.

88

00:06:02.230  -->  00:06:06.110
So most of the time all personnel use inner joins and left joins.

89

00:06:06.180  -->  00:06:11.490
Sometimes you'll rarely find that people do require full joins for the task at hand.

90

00:06:11.490  -->  00:06:12.810
So those were the type of joins.

91

00:06:12.810  -->  00:06:17.040
And that brings us to the conclusion of today's tutorial and I'll see you next time
