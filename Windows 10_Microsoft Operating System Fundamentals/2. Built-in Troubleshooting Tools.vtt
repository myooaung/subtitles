1
00:00:00.364 --> 00:00:03.811
Built-in Troubleshooting Tools.

2
00:00:03.811 --> 00:00:06.360
I'm going to run through a number of interface screenshots

3
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.403
and talk on top of them for a moment.

4
00:00:08.403 --> 00:00:11.837
Then we'll turn our attention to a demo so that you can see

5
00:00:11.837 --> 00:00:13.855
how to apply this theoretical knowledge.

6
00:00:13.855 --> 00:00:17.059
The troubleshooting system has been in Windows for several versions,

7
00:00:17.059 --> 00:00:19.488
I know I say that a lot over the course of the training,

8
00:00:19.488 --> 00:00:23.528
but I want you to see the difference between what's new and what's not new.

9
00:00:23.528 --> 00:00:25.077
The troubleshooting system in Windows 10,

10
00:00:25.077 --> 00:00:26.110
as you can see,

11
00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:29.245
you can find through the Update and Security Settings

12
00:00:29.245 --> 00:00:31.212
app under the Troubleshoot tab,

13
00:00:31.212 --> 00:00:33.405
and there's a number of these troubleshooters that

14
00:00:33.405 --> 00:00:36.951
you can just pick from the list on, Internet Connections,

15
00:00:36.951 --> 00:00:39.215
Audio, Printer, Windows Update problems,

16
00:00:39.215 --> 00:00:41.144
Blue Screen, Bluetooth, etc.

17
00:00:41.144 --> 00:00:44.185
You'll often find that the Windows Error Reporting subsystem

18
00:00:44.185 --> 00:00:46.877
will sometimes invoke or offer a selective,

19
00:00:46.877 --> 00:00:52.074
a specific, I should say, troubleshooter if you have a specific failure happen.

20
00:00:52.074 --> 00:00:53.703
If you have printer failures,

21
00:00:53.703 --> 00:00:56.535
you might have Windows 10 recommend automatically that

22
00:00:56.535 --> 00:00:58.726
you run the printer troubleshooter.

23
00:00:58.726 --> 00:01:00.066
These are pretty cool.

24
00:01:00.066 --> 00:01:02.410
They're best experienced live and in person.

25
00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.718
The idea here is that you don't necessarily have to open a support

26
00:01:05.718 --> 00:01:09.494
ticket with Microsoft or bring your computer to your nearest

27
00:01:09.494 --> 00:01:11.862
authorized repair shop or mom-and-pop repair shop,

28
00:01:11.862 --> 00:01:14.957
as the case may be, to have your system looked at.

29
00:01:14.957 --> 00:01:17.984
You may very well be able to resolve problems on your own.

30
00:01:17.984 --> 00:01:19.426
If you're an IT professional,

31
00:01:19.426 --> 00:01:22.242
the ability to troubleshoot Windows 10 systems

32
00:01:22.242 --> 00:01:25.166
efficiently is an awfully valuable skill,

33
00:01:25.166 --> 00:01:29.191
and you can become your fellow employees' best friend by

34
00:01:29.191 --> 00:01:31.655
helping them restore productivity.

35
00:01:31.655 --> 00:01:33.671
I mentioned Windows Error Reporting.

36
00:01:33.671 --> 00:01:35.686
This runs as a service.

37
00:01:35.686 --> 00:01:39.020
You see in this screenshot I'm creating a variable called e

38
00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.840
that grabs a reference to the service,

39
00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.746
its name is WerSvc for Windows Error Reporting Service,

40
00:01:45.746 --> 00:01:50.177
and then if I pipeline the e variable to Format-List *,

41
00:01:50.177 --> 00:01:51.323
I've shown you this before,

42
00:01:51.323 --> 00:01:54.199
this is a way in PowerShell to get a run of all

43
00:01:54.199 --> 00:01:55.658
available properties for an object.

44
00:01:55.658 --> 00:01:56.517
That's really it.

45
00:01:56.517 --> 00:01:59.953
I want to inject little bits of PowerShell as we go along,

46
00:01:59.953 --> 00:02:04.353
because I want it to be very near the top of your list to be

47
00:02:04.353 --> 00:02:06.095
comfortable and proficient in PowerShell,

48
00:02:06.095 --> 00:02:09.511
because you're not going to be a Windows 10 professional

49
00:02:09.511 --> 00:02:12.208
power user unless you can do this automation.

50
00:02:12.208 --> 00:02:15.181
What I want to draw your attention to is the startup type.

51
00:02:15.181 --> 00:02:15.919
It's manual.

52
00:02:15.919 --> 00:02:19.612
The default status of the WER service is triggered Start,

53
00:02:19.612 --> 00:02:24.927
which means that it will remain silent unless it's triggered into action by

54
00:02:24.927 --> 00:02:29.283
a failure in some subsystem on your Windows 10 computer,

55
00:02:29.283 --> 00:02:33.511
and then it will write verbose messages that you can retrieve.

56
00:02:33.511 --> 00:02:36.920
Well, how can you retrieve those results, you might ask?

57
00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.793
This is done through the classic Control Panel under

58
00:02:39.793 --> 00:02:41.745
Security and Maintenance Problem Reports.

59
00:02:41.745 --> 00:02:44.809
This is a pretty robust interface where,

60
00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:46.145
depending upon what happened,

61
00:02:46.145 --> 00:02:49.928
whether it was a Windows Update installation problem or a

62
00:02:49.928 --> 00:02:52.596
process just crashed or stopped working,

63
00:02:52.596 --> 00:02:55.884
you can view detailed information on that problem,

64
00:02:55.884 --> 00:02:59.895
and you can send report information to the vendor if

65
00:02:59.895 --> 00:03:01.867
you're working with them specifically.

66
00:03:01.867 --> 00:03:04.443
I'll show you this in more detail in the demo.

67
00:03:04.443 --> 00:03:06.793
Here I just want to get you familiar with the feature

68
00:03:06.793 --> 00:03:09.564
and how to find it in Windows 10.

69
00:03:09.564 --> 00:03:15.043
The Feedback Hub is found in Settings under Privacy, Feedback & Diagnostics.

70
00:03:15.043 --> 00:03:19.012
You can be selective on how much data you send to Microsoft.

71
00:03:19.012 --> 00:03:21.377
When Microsoft released Windows 10,

72
00:03:21.377 --> 00:03:25.907
they received some backlash from some areas of the public who

73
00:03:25.907 --> 00:03:29.997
thought that Microsoft was assuming too much in terms of what kind

74
00:03:29.997 --> 00:03:32.499
of anonymized data you want to send back.

75
00:03:32.499 --> 00:03:34.319
It's what called telemetry data.

76
00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:37.649
The idea is, Microsoft can take this anonymized data,

77
00:03:37.649 --> 00:03:41.168
they don't care about your browsing habits or what

78
00:03:41.168 --> 00:03:44.554
applications you install necessarily, all that's your business,

79
00:03:44.554 --> 00:03:48.217
but when a crash occurs, it's nice to be able,

80
00:03:48.217 --> 00:03:48.949
Microsoft developers,

81
00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:53.872
it's nice for them to be able to look at these logs from real live customers,

82
00:03:53.872 --> 00:03:57.896
and that can turn into bug reports and fixes and improve the

83
00:03:57.896 --> 00:04:00.903
quality of your Windows and application experience.

84
00:04:00.903 --> 00:04:04.802
That having been said, you do have the ability to control your privacy,

85
00:04:04.802 --> 00:04:09.980
in fact, look at that huge list across Location services,

86
00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:11.166
Microphone, Speech, Account,

87
00:04:11.166 --> 00:04:15.391
you can really be granular in the degree to which you're willing

88
00:04:15.391 --> 00:04:18.038
to participate in this feedback gathering.

89
00:04:18.038 --> 00:04:21.648
Check the exercise files, because I saw a news item just today,

90
00:04:21.648 --> 00:04:24.284
I'm recording this video in January 2018,

91
00:04:24.284 --> 00:04:28.388
where Microsoft is planning to add a feature to Windows 10 that

92
00:04:28.388 --> 00:04:32.105
allows you to see specifically and exactly the data that goes

93
00:04:32.105 --> 00:04:34.228
to Microsoft before you send it.

94
00:04:34.228 --> 00:04:38.011
Very nice, I admire Microsoft for their transparency.

95
00:04:38.011 --> 00:04:41.486
The Event Viewer, again, I'm going to sound like a broken record,

96
00:04:41.486 --> 00:04:44.169
but it's been around forever pretty much,

97
00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:47.665
predominantly in the NT line of business Windows versions,

98
00:04:47.665 --> 00:04:52.578
but Event Viewer has even been in consumer Windows for a long time,

99
00:04:52.578 --> 00:04:56.736
and this is where the system, which is Windows itself,

100
00:04:56.736 --> 00:04:59.249
can write entries, informational entries,

101
00:04:59.249 --> 00:05:03.019
warning entries, error entries, on what's happening on the machine.

102
00:05:03.019 --> 00:05:06.645
The Event Viewer is a way to figure out what's happening on a system,

103
00:05:06.645 --> 00:05:09.449
so it's a go-to troubleshooting source.

104
00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:15.257
One common beginner issue is I can find that such and so errors are occurring,

105
00:05:15.257 --> 00:05:17.544
and they're referencing a specific Event ID,

106
00:05:17.544 --> 00:05:20.710
what does that Event ID actually mean, that's the question.

107
00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:23.894
The good news is that just about all Event IDs,

108
00:05:23.894 --> 00:05:33.000
at least as far as Windows code base is concerned, have been documented, so they're just as nearby as a quick web search.
