1
00:00:01,909 --> 00:00:02,873
In this demonstration,

2
00:00:02,873 --> 00:00:07,988
we'll focus on the Windows 10 desktop environment specifically the Start menu,

3
00:00:07,988 --> 00:00:10,181
the taskbar, and the notifications area.

4
00:00:10,181 --> 00:00:13,390
You can open the Start menu in a number of different ways,

5
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:15,384
of course, left-clicking it with the mouse,

6
00:00:15,384 --> 00:00:17,906
you can also press the Start button on your keyboard,

7
00:00:17,906 --> 00:00:20,845
that's the button a couple to the left of your Space

8
00:00:20,845 --> 00:00:22,661
bar that looks like the Windows flag.

9
00:00:22,661 --> 00:00:25,475
Now I showed you a screenshot of this so I don't

10
00:00:25,475 --> 00:00:27,149
need to give a full explanation.

11
00:00:27,149 --> 00:00:30,105
I'll just get right to some of the useful shortcuts.

12
00:00:30,105 --> 00:00:34,960
Notice that we can expand or contract the left side of the Start menu

13
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,275
that gives you access to your user account settings.

14
00:00:38,275 --> 00:00:41,350
If you click your user account, you can change your settings,

15
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:45,126
lock the computer, or sign out potentially as a different user.

16
00:00:45,126 --> 00:00:48,076
We have File Explorer which we'll look at shortly,

17
00:00:48,076 --> 00:00:52,703
Settings we cover in the next module, and then Power allows you to sleep,

18
00:00:52,703 --> 00:00:54,297
shutdown, or restart the system.

19
00:00:54,297 --> 00:00:56,506
I'm going to collapse that left side.

20
00:00:56,506 --> 00:01:00,011
The middle part gives you a scrollable list that's alphabetized

21
00:01:00,011 --> 00:01:02,304
that has all of your different programs in it.

22
00:01:02,304 --> 00:01:04,950
Now there is different things you can do with these programs.

23
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:06,385
What do I mean by that?

24
00:01:06,385 --> 00:01:09,386
Well I'd like to encourage you that I know I'm going to eventually

25
00:01:09,386 --> 00:01:11,515
sound like a broken record album saying this,

26
00:01:11,515 --> 00:01:15,350
but I want to encourage you to get into the habit of

27
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:18,204
right-clicking everything in Windows 10 because you're going to

28
00:01:18,204 --> 00:01:21,584
find that there is almost always a context sensitive shortcut menu

29
00:01:21,584 --> 00:01:24,503
from which you can do advanced options.

30
00:01:24,503 --> 00:01:27,261
So Google Chrome, if this is something that I use a lot,

31
00:01:27,261 --> 00:01:31,291
I may want to pin it to start and notice that when I pin it to start,

32
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:33,371
it shows up on the third side,

33
00:01:33,371 --> 00:01:37,064
the right side of our apps which give you your tiles.

34
00:01:37,064 --> 00:01:40,574
Now sometimes I'll post static icons like Chrome,

35
00:01:40,574 --> 00:01:43,982
but things really light up once you get into more

36
00:01:43,982 --> 00:01:45,789
dynamic applications like weather, for instance.

37
00:01:45,789 --> 00:01:48,714
Now you probably think well what just happened there Tim.

38
00:01:48,714 --> 00:01:50,629
Now let me start over again.

39
00:01:50,629 --> 00:01:53,720
Press the Windows flag and just simply start to type.

40
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:57,362
I find that I very rarely have to scroll through those programs.

41
00:01:57,362 --> 00:01:59,656
If I know any part of the name,

42
00:01:59,656 --> 00:02:02,810
I can simply start to type and I'm off and running.

43
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:05,510
If I right-click Weather, I can pin it to the Start menu,

44
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:09,505
I can pin it to the taskbar, and then there is some social media options,

45
00:02:09,505 --> 00:02:10,990
and I can even uninstall it.

46
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:14,987
Well I'm going to pin it to Start, and then if I reopen the Start menu,

47
00:02:14,987 --> 00:02:17,140
I now have the weather icon.

48
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:19,517
Now I need to actually, let me right-click,

49
00:02:19,517 --> 00:02:23,059
you can resize it into different sizes, right-click again,

50
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:26,658
go to More, Turn Live Tile on.

51
00:02:26,658 --> 00:02:27,439
Ah-ha, once again,

52
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:31,186
this is something that you may not get to if you don't have

53
00:02:31,186 --> 00:02:33,829
the habit of right-clicking on everything.

54
00:02:33,829 --> 00:02:34,756
If I turn it on,

55
00:02:34,756 --> 00:02:36,609
then it's going to actually try to connect to the

56
00:02:36,609 --> 00:02:37,912
internet and display the weather.

57
00:02:37,912 --> 00:02:40,414
Now I'm going to left-click to open the application

58
00:02:40,414 --> 00:02:42,784
because I haven't actually set it yet.

59
00:02:42,784 --> 00:02:45,716
I'm going to set it where I live in Nashville,

60
00:02:45,716 --> 00:02:48,859
Tennessee and click Start, and here is my current temperature.

61
00:02:48,859 --> 00:02:51,521
Yes, it's November and it's 61 and sunny,

62
00:02:51,521 --> 00:02:55,325
and yes, I've very grateful for that, thank you very much.

63
00:02:55,325 --> 00:02:58,569
We close that application and come back to Start and there we go.

64
00:02:58,569 --> 00:03:03,768
So this is a good example of the live tile and notice that you can group these.

65
00:03:03,768 --> 00:03:06,166
Now notice if you hover above a live tile,

66
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:10,814
you can create a group and actually place multiple tiles in that group.

67
00:03:10,814 --> 00:03:14,131
You see that I've gotten rid of the other tiles that I have on this screen,

68
00:03:14,131 --> 00:03:18,495
once again, you can do that by right-clicking and selecting Unpin from Start.

69
00:03:18,495 --> 00:03:21,725
If you're wondering how to get to Start menu options,

70
00:03:21,725 --> 00:03:24,318
it's as easy as opening settings.

71
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:27,415
I'll come back down to the lower left corner of the Start

72
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:29,309
menu and open the settings application.

73
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:33,327
In the Find a setting, I'll type Start menu and press Enter.

74
00:03:33,327 --> 00:03:36,159
This gives us a whole bunch of specific options,

75
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:40,512
choosing which folders appear on Start, whether you want to do the full screen,

76
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:43,085
Start, I mentioned that to you earlier actually.

77
00:03:43,085 --> 00:03:47,091
I'll go to Start settings and let's see if there's anything that jumps out.

78
00:03:47,091 --> 00:03:48,040
Well like I said,

79
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:51,057
here's Use Start full screen and the other ones look like just

80
00:03:51,057 --> 00:03:54,607
whether you want to show the apps list on or off,

81
00:03:54,607 --> 00:03:57,123
if you want recently added apps to be highlighted,

82
00:03:57,123 --> 00:04:02,443
if you want recently opened items in jump lists on the start or on the taskbar.

83
00:04:02,443 --> 00:04:06,037
Speaking of which, this preference pane for Start is pretty handy,

84
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:09,546
it's part of the personalization settings group and you'll notice that

85
00:04:09,546 --> 00:04:12,566
you can adjust things like the desktop background,

86
00:04:12,566 --> 00:04:15,891
the color scheme, what you have on the Lock screen,

87
00:04:15,891 --> 00:04:18,084
Start, and then of course, there's Taskbar.

88
00:04:18,084 --> 00:04:21,717
Taskbar has options like whether you want to hide the taskbar,

89
00:04:21,717 --> 00:04:23,585
I've never been a fan of that honestly.

90
00:04:23,585 --> 00:04:26,517
You notice that there is separate options for hiding the

91
00:04:26,517 --> 00:04:28,635
taskbar in desktop or tablet mode.

92
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:31,842
We'll talk about continuum a little later on in the course.

93
00:04:31,842 --> 00:04:35,516
That's where if you're using a two-in-one device like a Surface Pro tablet,

94
00:04:35,516 --> 00:04:38,674
you can get a slightly different UI depending upon

95
00:04:38,674 --> 00:04:40,944
whether the keyboard is attached or not.

96
00:04:40,944 --> 00:04:41,885
Now notice this,

97
00:04:41,885 --> 00:04:45,963
it says replace command prompt with Windows PowerShell in the menu when I

98
00:04:45,963 --> 00:04:49,128
right-click the Start button or press Windows key+X.

99
00:04:49,128 --> 00:04:53,000
That's a pretty useful preference come to think of it and I'm glad that

100
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,239
reminded me of it because this is definitely a power user thing.

101
00:04:56,239 --> 00:04:59,199
It's one thing to open the honest-to-goodness Start menu,

102
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,342
I'll do that occasionally if I can't remember a program's name

103
00:05:02,342 --> 00:05:04,881
or if I'm not sure the program is installed.

104
00:05:04,881 --> 00:05:06,372
Oftentimes, as I said before,

105
00:05:06,372 --> 00:05:10,406
I'll use the Windows key and just start to type to get answers,

106
00:05:10,406 --> 00:05:15,020
and you'll notice that those results come back not only with local resources,

107
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:19,005
but sometimes resources in the Windows store or on the web.

108
00:05:19,005 --> 00:05:19,656
But anyway,

109
00:05:19,656 --> 00:05:23,520
where I was going with this suggestion was right-clicking the Start menu,

110
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,767
this is really cool.

111
00:05:24,767 --> 00:05:29,612
This is what I call the Power User's Start menu and it gives you one-click

112
00:05:29,612 --> 00:05:32,573
access to all of your most important administrative options.

113
00:05:32,573 --> 00:05:37,415
We'll be getting into a lot of these administrative tools like Event Viewer,

114
00:05:37,415 --> 00:05:39,928
System, Power Options as we go along,

115
00:05:39,928 --> 00:05:44,423
but this is just a gradual unfolding and I don't want to overwhelm us too early.

116
00:05:44,423 --> 00:05:47,663
Some of you who have worked with earlier versions of

117
00:05:47,663 --> 00:05:50,226
Windows wonders where the old Run box went.

118
00:05:50,226 --> 00:05:52,681
Notice that you can get to it, like I said,

119
00:05:52,681 --> 00:05:54,867
by right-clicking the Start button and selecting R.

120
00:05:54,867 --> 00:06:00,223
This is useful if you want to open up a command if you know its name,

121
00:06:00,223 --> 00:06:01,863
for instance, like ncpa.

122
00:06:01,863 --> 00:06:05,117
cpl is a file name that I'll always remember.

123
00:06:05,117 --> 00:06:08,009
That's a shortcut way to open up the network

124
00:06:08,009 --> 00:06:10,418
connections available on that computer.

125
00:06:10,418 --> 00:06:13,726
Now the keyboard shortcut is Windows key+X.

126
00:06:13,726 --> 00:06:24,000
Windows key+X will give you this and it also has the ability to sign out, sleep, shut down, or restart, so that's a useful tip like I said.
