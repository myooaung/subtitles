00:00:01.802 --> 00:00:04.996
What this course is all about.

2
00:00:04.996 --> 00:00:07.988
Let's review the intended audiences for this course because I want

3
00:00:07.988 --> 00:00:10.446
to make sure that you're in the right place.

4
00:00:10.446 --> 00:00:11.359
First of all,

5
00:00:11.359 --> 00:00:15.326
we have those who work in the information technology field full time,

6
00:00:15.326 --> 00:00:16.143
IT professionals.

7
00:00:16.143 --> 00:00:20.023
The job roles associated with this role could be anything

8
00:00:20.023 --> 00:00:23.792
from a technical support desk person, a desktop support engineer,

9
00:00:23.792 --> 00:00:28.150
it could be an installation engineer or a systems administrator,

10
00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:29.258
or technically,

11
00:00:29.258 --> 00:00:32.556
anybody whose full-time work involves information

12
00:00:32.556 --> 00:00:35.805
technology mainly from the infrastructure side.

13
00:00:35.805 --> 00:00:39.527
I don't want to leave out developers because application developers,

14
00:00:39.527 --> 00:00:40.719
also called programmers,

15
00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:45.891
oftentimes I've found in my experience may be missing some of the power user,

16
00:00:45.891 --> 00:00:49.502
end user skills, and I submit that by learning those skills,

17
00:00:49.502 --> 00:00:52.363
this can help your work as a programmer greatly.

18
00:00:52.363 --> 00:00:55.791
Information workers are business professionals whose line of

19
00:00:55.791 --> 00:00:58.752
business may not have anything to do with IT,

20
00:00:58.752 --> 00:00:59.385
but nonetheless,

21
00:00:59.385 --> 00:01:04.125
having Windows 10 expertise will allow you to do your job much more efficiently.

22
00:01:04.125 --> 00:01:07.401
Students, you could be a secondary school student,

23
00:01:07.401 --> 00:01:10.091
a professional school student, university student,

24
00:01:10.091 --> 00:01:14.001
whatever the case may be where computer literacy is on the menu.

25
00:01:14.001 --> 00:01:17.729
And then finally, there is the residential or home PC user.

26
00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.479
These could be people who are interested in learning more about

27
00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:24.493
Windows at a deeper level than what you might find elsewhere in say a

28
00:01:24.493 --> 00:01:29.272
typical end user book or training course.

29
00:01:29.272 --> 00:01:33.165
I've aligned all of the content in this course to a

30
00:01:33.165 --> 00:01:34.227
Microsoft certification exam.

31
00:01:34.227 --> 00:01:40.231
That exam idea is 98-349 and its title is Windows Operating System Fundamentals.

32
00:01:40.231 --> 00:01:44.842
Now this certification is called the MTA for Microsoft Technology Associate

33
00:01:44.842 --> 00:01:49.446
and it's a line of entry-level certifications that are targeted at those

34
00:01:49.446 --> 00:01:52.765
with little to no previous experience with IT.

35
00:01:52.765 --> 00:01:56.217
Thus, if you're a student and you're looking to get into the IT field,

36
00:01:56.217 --> 00:01:59.152
this is a great first step in that direction,

37
00:01:59.152 --> 00:02:01.541
and by passing this single certification exam,

38
00:02:01.541 --> 00:02:04.733
you'll have an honest to goodness Microsoft credential that

39
00:02:04.733 --> 00:02:08.669
you can put on your LinkedIn profile, advertise on your resume,

40
00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:09.073
etc.

41
00:02:09.073 --> 00:02:10.286
Now at Pluralsight,

42
00:02:10.286 --> 00:02:15.137
we no longer officially title our courses to map to the Microsoft exams.

43
00:02:15.137 --> 00:02:19.241
That can make it a little bit difficult sometimes to find training,

44
00:02:19.241 --> 00:02:22.220
so I'm glad that you're watching this first module and you're

45
00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.028
seeing this information on your screen now.

46
00:02:24.028 --> 00:02:27.889
The reason for this is that we find that Microsoft in particular,

47
00:02:27.889 --> 00:02:31.479
their technology has evolved so quickly that Microsoft Learning,

48
00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:34.104
the group who makes the certification exams,

49
00:02:34.104 --> 00:02:36.825
are always having to chase their own tail,

50
00:02:36.825 --> 00:02:41.205
so by updating our training almost continuously becomes kind of unworkable.

51
00:02:41.205 --> 00:02:44.876
So instead, we map to career skills, and in this course,

52
00:02:44.876 --> 00:02:48.862
it just so happens that the career skills I'm targeting

53
00:02:48.862 --> 00:02:51.421
align perfectly with that MTA exam.

54
00:02:51.421 --> 00:02:53.766
Now if you are interested in passing this exam,

55
00:02:53.766 --> 00:02:57.619
I'd suggest first of all that you head over to the Microsoft Learning website.

56
00:02:57.619 --> 00:03:02.180
I have a short URL in this slide, timw.

57
00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.687
info/mta.

58
00:03:02.687 --> 00:03:05.609
The final module of this course is going to be a

59
00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:07.578
detailed breakdown of this exam, so don't worry,

60
00:03:07.578 --> 00:03:10.155
don't think well are you just throwing me to the wolves,

61
00:03:10.155 --> 00:03:10.389
Tim.

62
00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:11.325
No not at all.

63
00:03:11.325 --> 00:03:13.260
By the time you reach that last module,

64
00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.297
you'll have all the subject matter mastered and you'll be ready to really

65
00:03:17.297 --> 00:03:21.933
drill in and pass the test if that is one of your goals.

66
00:03:21.933 --> 00:03:26.580
I'm going to throw in a number of historical perspective slides in order to

67
00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.884
put us in a historical context with Microsoft Windows.

68
00:03:30.884 --> 00:03:36.470
This screenshot is from Windows version 1 way back when in November 1985.

69
00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.966
It's easy to laugh at this, but at the time,

70
00:03:38.966 --> 00:03:41.826
it was very novel to have a graphical user interface.

71
00:03:41.826 --> 00:03:44.892
Back in those days, it was all command line,

72
00:03:44.892 --> 00:03:48.863
the Microsoft Disk Operating System or MS-DOS as it was known.

73
00:03:48.863 --> 00:03:52.449
So to be able to use a mouse and intuitively click around,

74
00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:55.488
yes, Apple had the Macintosh at roughly the same time,

75
00:03:55.488 --> 00:03:57.915
but this was a big deal at the time.

76
00:03:57.915 --> 00:04:00.400
And if you run Windows 1 now, believe it or not,

77
00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:06.220
you can set up a virtual machine that runs MS-DOS and Windows 1.

78
00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.668
01.

79
00:04:06.668 --> 00:04:16.000
It's very clunky indeed and very primitive, but I want to put that in perspective as we study Windows 10 in this course.
