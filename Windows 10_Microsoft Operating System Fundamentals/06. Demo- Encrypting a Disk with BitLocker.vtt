00:00:01.418 --> 00:00:04.936
In this next demo, we'll work with BitLocker in EFS.

2
00:00:04.936 --> 00:00:06.830
It's challenging, to say the least,

3
00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.337
to cover so much ground in just the space of a single,

4
00:00:10.337 --> 00:00:12.413
short demo, but I'll do my very best.

5
00:00:12.413 --> 00:00:15.162
Let's do a search from the Start menu for BitLocker,

6
00:00:15.162 --> 00:00:19.323
and it brings up an entry called Manage BitLocker in Control Panel.

7
00:00:19.323 --> 00:00:23.060
And of course, this is the old school classic Control Panel.

8
00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.225
And as long as your system supports BitLocker Drive Encryption,

9
00:00:26.225 --> 00:00:29.675
you can use it to protect not only your system drive,

10
00:00:29.675 --> 00:00:30.929
but any other drives.

11
00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:31.900
D and F,

12
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.486
my data drive and my ReFS file that I created in the previous demo

13
00:00:36.486 --> 00:00:38.745
are considered removeable for whatever reason,

14
00:00:38.745 --> 00:00:41.308
and there we use BitLocker To Go,

15
00:00:41.308 --> 00:00:45.604
which is largely the same thing as using traditional BitLocker Disk Encryption.

16
00:00:45.604 --> 00:00:49.344
Now this system does not have a TPM in it.

17
00:00:49.344 --> 00:00:51.903
We can verify that a couple different ways.

18
00:00:51.903 --> 00:00:54.138
We can type tpm.

19
00:00:54.138 --> 00:00:58.607
msc to open the Trusted Platform Module console,

20
00:00:58.607 --> 00:01:01.558
and it says Compatible TPM cannot be found.

21
00:01:01.558 --> 00:01:03.744
So if I want to continue to use BitLocker,

22
00:01:03.744 --> 00:01:06.958
I'm going to have to do a little hack here in Group Policy.

23
00:01:06.958 --> 00:01:11.416
Now I'm going to be working with Group Policy locally on the system.

24
00:01:11.416 --> 00:01:13.659
From Run, I'll do gpedit.

25
00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:14.108
msc.

26
00:01:14.108 --> 00:01:16.276
That opens the Local Group Policy Editor.

27
00:01:16.276 --> 00:01:20.710
In the editor, I want to go to Local Computer Policy,

28
00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.435
Computer Configuration, Administrative Templates,

29
00:01:23.435 --> 00:01:26.088
Windows Components, BitLocker Drive Encryption,

30
00:01:26.088 --> 00:01:30.132
and then if we're going to operate on operating system drives,

31
00:01:30.132 --> 00:01:33.375
we'll go to the Operating System Drives option.

32
00:01:33.375 --> 00:01:35.537
I'm going to sort these settings alphabetically,

33
00:01:35.537 --> 00:01:41.330
and I want the Require additional authentication at startup group policy option.

34
00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.541
I am going to open this up, we're going to enable the policy,

35
00:01:44.541 --> 00:01:49.066
and we're going to make sure Allow BitLocker without a compatible TPM

36
00:01:49.066 --> 00:01:53.620
requires a password or a startup key or a USB flash drive.

37
00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.404
And then if we do that, we can configure policies.

38
00:01:56.404 --> 00:01:59.133
I mean, if your system did have a TPM chip,

39
00:01:59.133 --> 00:02:01.464
you'd want to obviously leave that unchecked,

40
00:02:01.464 --> 00:02:05.180
and you can allow or require the TPM used,

41
00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.612
and then choose any additional authentication methods if you want to.

42
00:02:09.612 --> 00:02:12.869
I'm going to hack this, so I'm going to not allow TPM,

43
00:02:12.869 --> 00:02:17.355
and I'm just going to leave the other ones at Allow as opposed to Require.

44
00:02:17.355 --> 00:02:20.249
A startup PIN is a personal identification number.

45
00:02:20.249 --> 00:02:23.845
A startup key is a specially formatted USB dongle.

46
00:02:23.845 --> 00:02:25.875
You could just use a USB flash drive.

47
00:02:25.875 --> 00:02:29.443
And then there's an option to require both the startup key and PIN.

48
00:02:29.443 --> 00:02:31.776
I'm going to OK out of Group Policy,

49
00:02:31.776 --> 00:02:35.236
and then in order to make sure that I've applied the policy,

50
00:02:35.236 --> 00:02:37.584
let me open up an elevated PowerShell console,

51
00:02:37.584 --> 00:02:40.865
and let me do an Invoke-GPUdate on my localhost.

52
00:02:40.865 --> 00:02:45.801
So now I can step through the process of turning on BitLocker.

53
00:02:45.801 --> 00:02:49.739
It's first going to do a check, and then after it passes the check,

54
00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:52.504
it asked how do you want to unlock the drive at startup?

55
00:02:52.504 --> 00:02:54.908
Then you choose how you want to unlock the drive,

56
00:02:54.908 --> 00:02:58.711
either inserting a USB dongle or entering a password.

57
00:02:58.711 --> 00:03:00.935
I'll enter the password, confirm it, click Next,

58
00:03:00.935 --> 00:03:03.689
and then you have to back up your recovery key.

59
00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:05.871
I'm going to save it to a file.

60
00:03:05.871 --> 00:03:08.639
And I have a mounted disk here somewhere, don't I?

61
00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:11.612
Well, just for now, I'm going to put it on drive F.

62
00:03:11.612 --> 00:03:14.501
And it can't be in the root directory of removeable drives,

63
00:03:14.501 --> 00:03:17.307
so I'm going to create a folder called bl for BitLocker,

64
00:03:17.307 --> 00:03:18.328
save it in there.

65
00:03:18.328 --> 00:03:21.747
Now this is obviously a very, very sensitive file.

66
00:03:21.747 --> 00:03:25.622
Anybody who gets that file will be able to unlock the

67
00:03:25.622 --> 00:03:27.587
disk by supplying that recovery key.

68
00:03:27.587 --> 00:03:28.848
See what I mean?

69
00:03:28.848 --> 00:03:33.874
The options are to encrypt used space only or to encrypt the entire drive.

70
00:03:33.874 --> 00:03:35.891
I'm just going to choose the first option here.

71
00:03:35.891 --> 00:03:39.425
And you have some additional options for encryption mode.

72
00:03:39.425 --> 00:03:40.860
I'll leave that at the default.

73
00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.658
Are you ready to encrypt this drive, run the system check,

74
00:03:43.658 --> 00:03:46.465
and it's going to require a restart to do that.

75
00:03:46.465 --> 00:03:54.000
So because we have more work to do here, I'm going to pause that, and I'm going to go right into EFS.
