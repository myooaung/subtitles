1
00:00:01,975 --> 00:00:02,834
Offline Files.

2
00:00:02,834 --> 00:00:08,810
The Offline Files use case is a user takes her work laptop home and

3
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:11,312
wants to continue working network-based files,

4
00:00:11,312 --> 00:00:14,790
and let me say, in the absence of a virtual private network,

5
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:15,659
or VPN connection.

6
00:00:15,659 --> 00:00:16,542
Is this possible?

7
00:00:16,542 --> 00:00:17,132
Well, sure.

8
00:00:17,132 --> 00:00:20,374
Offline Files has been around for a long, long time.

9
00:00:20,374 --> 00:00:21,949
It relies upon caching.

10
00:00:21,949 --> 00:00:26,277
A user connects through, say, a mapped drive letter to network-based files.

11
00:00:26,277 --> 00:00:30,256
He or she goes home and can still get in work on those files when

12
00:00:30,256 --> 00:00:32,632
they're not connected to the corporate network.

13
00:00:32,632 --> 00:00:35,227
When they plug into the corporate network the next day,

14
00:00:35,227 --> 00:00:38,822
a synchronization takes place, the server copies are updated,

15
00:00:38,822 --> 00:00:40,309
and you're back in business.

16
00:00:40,309 --> 00:00:42,689
That's the general use case for Offline Files.

17
00:00:42,689 --> 00:00:46,879
It's meant to be a convenient method to access network-based

18
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:48,598
resources when you're not in the network.

19
00:00:48,598 --> 00:00:52,222
And I'm going to explain the rest of it through a demo.

20
00:00:52,222 --> 00:00:53,333
In this brief demo,

21
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:58,908
I want to show you how Offline Files work in Windows Server 2016 and Windows 10.

22
00:00:58,908 --> 00:01:02,296
We're on a Windows Server 2016 server here,

23
00:01:02,296 --> 00:01:04,658
and I've created a folder called reports that

24
00:01:04,658 --> 00:01:07,053
contains a bunch of sample text files.

25
00:01:07,053 --> 00:01:10,425
And I've already shared this resource out on the network.

26
00:01:10,425 --> 00:01:12,678
Let me right-click the folder, go to Properties,

27
00:01:12,678 --> 00:01:15,319
go to Sharing, go to Advanced Sharing, go to Caching,

28
00:01:15,319 --> 00:01:17,386
I know it's a lot of clicking,

29
00:01:17,386 --> 00:01:20,420
but this brings you to the Offline Settings dialog.

30
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:21,622
And you see, by default,

31
00:01:21,622 --> 00:01:24,595
only the files and programs that users specify are available offline.

32
00:01:24,595 --> 00:01:28,741
And in my experience in the business world, that almost never happens.

33
00:01:28,741 --> 00:01:32,809
Users have no idea what offline files are, and they don't care.

34
00:01:32,809 --> 00:01:35,276
But if you want to allow this capability,

35
00:01:35,276 --> 00:01:39,699
you can choose All files and programs that users open from the

36
00:01:39,699 --> 00:01:41,904
shared folder are automatically available offline,

37
00:01:41,904 --> 00:01:45,145
and you can optimize that cache for performance.

38
00:01:45,145 --> 00:01:48,304
So you selectively enable offline files on the server,

39
00:01:48,304 --> 00:01:52,409
and then on the client, let's switch over to my Windows 10 client,

40
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:55,630
we can just do a search for offline files.

41
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:57,878
And that's not bringing us anywhere.

42
00:01:57,878 --> 00:02:00,126
How about if we do Cortana?

43
00:02:00,126 --> 00:02:03,289
That does give us a match here for Manage,

44
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:05,797
I should say, offline files in Control Panel.

45
00:02:05,797 --> 00:02:09,344
Okay, so this takes us to the old school Control Panel.

46
00:02:09,344 --> 00:02:12,597
You can enable or disable offline files here.

47
00:02:12,597 --> 00:02:16,076
Then you can open a tool called Sync Center that we'll take a look at.

48
00:02:16,076 --> 00:02:19,658
I'll open it right now and then minimize it just to keep it down there,

49
00:02:19,658 --> 00:02:22,872
and then you can view your offline files cache.

50
00:02:22,872 --> 00:02:23,150
Cool.

51
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:25,373
So I'm all ready now as a user.

52
00:02:25,373 --> 00:02:29,735
We can pretend that, say, I'm a laptop user, and I'm connecting to the network.

53
00:02:29,735 --> 00:02:31,259
Now how do you do that?

54
00:02:31,259 --> 00:02:31,513
Well,

55
00:02:31,513 --> 00:02:34,343
one fast way as an administrator is to use what's

56
00:02:34,343 --> 00:02:37,131
called universal naming convention, or UNC paths.

57
00:02:37,131 --> 00:02:39,415
Once again, I'll right-click Start, go to Run.

58
00:02:39,415 --> 00:02:42,011
Instead of a drive letter, we can do \\,

59
00:02:42,011 --> 00:02:45,028
and then if we know the name of the server,

60
00:02:45,028 --> 00:02:47,358
which I do, dc1, I'll type that.

61
00:02:47,358 --> 00:02:48,974
I'm in a domain,

62
00:02:48,974 --> 00:02:54,108
so I can establish a connection to shared resources that I have access to,

63
00:02:54,108 --> 00:02:56,807
and I do have access to this reports share.

64
00:02:56,807 --> 00:03:01,172
I can open these files directly from here and work on them all day long.

65
00:03:01,172 --> 00:03:02,460
I opened up that one.

66
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:04,005
I opened up this one, fine,

67
00:03:04,005 --> 00:03:08,992
or I could make the folder available on my system to show up as a drive letter.

68
00:03:08,992 --> 00:03:11,927
That's what's called a mapped network drive.

69
00:03:11,927 --> 00:03:15,560
You see I have drive Z mapped to my vmware-host.

70
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:19,243
Then I have my local drives that we've been working with thus far.

71
00:03:19,243 --> 00:03:22,567
Let me step back in File Explorer a couple steps.

72
00:03:22,567 --> 00:03:24,150
We right-click the shared folder.

73
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:26,684
We can come down to Map network drive.

74
00:03:26,684 --> 00:03:28,373
You can choose a drive letter.

75
00:03:28,373 --> 00:03:32,452
If this folder's called reports, why don't I see if I can get drive R.

76
00:03:32,452 --> 00:03:33,253
Yep, I can.

77
00:03:33,253 --> 00:03:36,727
Reconnect at sign-in, connect using different credentials.

78
00:03:36,727 --> 00:03:38,843
Nope, this is fine, so I'll click Finish.

79
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:42,263
And now I have this resource permanently mapped as drive R,

80
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:47,478
and I can get to I all day long in that way from this PC.

81
00:03:47,478 --> 00:03:48,860
Here it is, see?

82
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:50,945
Now I've opened a couple of those files.

83
00:03:50,945 --> 00:03:53,029
Let me open one more for good measure.

84
00:03:53,029 --> 00:03:56,939
I don't know why I'm having a problem opening up a doc file here,

85
00:03:56,939 --> 00:04:00,520
but anyway, let me open this Series Guidelines one more time,

86
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:00,845
okay.

87
00:04:00,845 --> 00:04:05,059
So I've done some file opening, and let's cut the connection to the network,

88
00:04:05,059 --> 00:04:07,928
and let's look at our offline cache.

89
00:04:07,928 --> 00:04:09,705
Certainly, if we're not connected to the network,

90
00:04:09,705 --> 00:04:12,509
we're not going to have access to that hard drive anymore.

91
00:04:12,509 --> 00:04:15,621
This is going to involve some user training by the way.

92
00:04:15,621 --> 00:04:17,974
If we open the Offline Files Control Panel,

93
00:04:17,974 --> 00:04:21,564
View your offline files, we can see that I have trainer,

94
00:04:21,564 --> 00:04:24,979
we can see Mapped network Drives, we have Offline Files Folder,

95
00:04:24,979 --> 00:04:27,801
and we can browse into Computers, dc1, reports,

96
00:04:27,801 --> 00:04:32,213
and then here are some of the files that I opened.

97
00:04:32,213 --> 00:04:34,618
Anything I do to these files offline,

98
00:04:34,618 --> 00:04:38,735
those changes are going to be synced back to the server

99
00:04:38,735 --> 00:04:41,202
when I'm reconnected to the domain.

100
00:04:41,202 --> 00:04:44,878
Windows 10 includes a new tool called Sync Center.

101
00:04:44,878 --> 00:04:48,720
It's available only, unfortunately, through the classic Control Panel,

102
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,877
as you see here, Sync Center.

103
00:04:50,877 --> 00:04:54,113
And we have what's called a sync partnership happening.

104
00:04:54,113 --> 00:04:57,176
The purpose of Sync Center is to give the user,

105
00:04:57,176 --> 00:05:01,641
the end user, and potentially the administrator or the help desk person,

106
00:05:01,641 --> 00:05:04,169
whomever, some more visibility in what's happening.

107
00:05:04,169 --> 00:05:07,570
For instance, it says network files available offline,

108
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:10,707
and you can force a synchronization event.

109
00:05:10,707 --> 00:05:12,986
This is basically a troubleshooting step.

110
00:05:12,986 --> 00:05:14,917
The synchronization should happen automatically,

111
00:05:14,917 --> 00:05:18,870
but we can force a synchronization if we need to.

112
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:23,058
And this also is important from a troubleshooting standpoint because

113
00:05:23,058 --> 00:05:28,951
what if you and your colleague have both worked with the same file

114
00:05:28,951 --> 00:05:31,285
while you were disconnected from the network,

115
00:05:31,285 --> 00:05:33,851
and you both attempted to sync at the same time?

116
00:05:33,851 --> 00:05:34,878
You see what I mean?

117
00:05:34,878 --> 00:05:38,165
This may be a case where an administrator may need

118
00:05:38,165 --> 00:05:40,137
to be brought into the equation.

119
00:05:40,137 --> 00:05:43,886
So that's a little bit on Offline Files and Sync Center.

120
00:05:43,886 --> 00:05:46,785
The takeaway here is that you need to manage these

121
00:05:46,785 --> 00:05:56,000
using the old school Control Panel, and this will, in all likelihood, involve some end user training to get this going.
