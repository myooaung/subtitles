1
00:00:02,172 --> 00:00:05,834
Alright, in this demo we'll look at Resource Monitor and Performance Monitor.

2
00:00:05,834 --> 00:00:09,386
We mentioned in the previous demo that Reliability Monitor is a great

3
00:00:09,386 --> 00:00:13,114
way to look at your system's behavior over time.

4
00:00:13,114 --> 00:00:14,868
Resource Monitor is an extension really,

5
00:00:14,868 --> 00:00:18,856
at least I consider it to be an extension of Task Manager.

6
00:00:18,856 --> 00:00:22,122
So let's open up Start and type resource monitor,

7
00:00:22,122 --> 00:00:25,860
and that comes up as a Desktop app here that runs in a

8
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:27,694
traditional Microsoft management console.

9
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:31,806
Now if I collapse CPU, you see at the top level here on the Overview page,

10
00:00:31,806 --> 00:00:37,275
we have a panel devoted to each of the four major subsystems of a computer.

11
00:00:37,275 --> 00:00:39,461
The processor, the hard drive, the network,

12
00:00:39,461 --> 00:00:40,086
and memory,

13
00:00:40,086 --> 00:00:43,748
and we can see what's called a heatmap that shows the

14
00:00:43,748 --> 00:00:47,390
average usage on those metrics, and then the peak.

15
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:52,908
So our CPU, at least my CPU, has hit 100% maximum frequency,

16
00:00:52,908 --> 00:00:56,871
my disk has had 2-3% Highest Active Time,

17
00:00:56,871 --> 00:00:59,315
that's not bad, very low Network Utilization,

18
00:00:59,315 --> 00:01:02,238
and about half of my Physical Memory is used.

19
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:05,786
Well let's expand one of these and we can see what's going on.

20
00:01:05,786 --> 00:01:09,897
We're going to get a list of processes that are in a couple different states,

21
00:01:09,897 --> 00:01:12,536
Running processes and ones that are sleeping,

22
00:01:12,536 --> 00:01:13,323
or Suspended.

23
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:16,865
Now let me quick sort by a couple criteria.

24
00:01:16,865 --> 00:01:21,792
Let's do Average CPU, and we have this MSMPEng.

25
00:01:21,792 --> 00:01:25,119
We can select that process and then right-click it to

26
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:29,208
end the process and the process tree, analyze the wait chain,

27
00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:35,388
in other words, are there other processes or actions that this one is blocking.

28
00:01:35,388 --> 00:01:39,963
We can search online, and it looks like it's going to hit up Edge, bing.

29
00:01:39,963 --> 00:01:46,011
com, and just search for that executable image name, MsMpEng.

30
00:01:46,011 --> 00:01:49,808
exe, and we see here that it's a component in Windows Defender.

31
00:01:49,808 --> 00:01:51,361
Okay, no big surprise there.

32
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:57,115
And you notice that we can go per subsystem here, CPU, Memory, Disk, Network.

33
00:01:57,115 --> 00:02:00,254
Again, I'll do a quick sort, and when we select an image here,

34
00:02:00,254 --> 00:02:02,309
notice that sometimes the view changes.

35
00:02:02,309 --> 00:02:06,118
For instance, on the CPU page, we've selected MsMpEng,

36
00:02:06,118 --> 00:02:11,165
and its associated service is in this case the Defender service.

37
00:02:11,165 --> 00:02:14,593
And notice that right from here, you can Stop the service,

38
00:02:14,593 --> 00:02:16,495
Restart it, or do a Search Online.

39
00:02:16,495 --> 00:02:17,527
That's really useful.

40
00:02:17,527 --> 00:02:21,520
Let me deselect that, and now I've selected the SearchIndexer process.

41
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,785
This is an important process that indexes all of the files and folders on

42
00:02:26,785 --> 00:02:29,297
your system so that you can find them conveniently.

43
00:02:29,297 --> 00:02:33,492
It looks like its associated service is Windows Search, again no surprise.

44
00:02:33,492 --> 00:02:34,405
And then under Handles,

45
00:02:34,405 --> 00:02:37,536
let me collapse these other ones that I don't need right now,

46
00:02:37,536 --> 00:02:40,766
it shows you specifically what that process is doing,

47
00:02:40,766 --> 00:02:44,822
what kind of activity it's performing, is it a file event?

48
00:02:44,822 --> 00:02:47,643
Is it some kind of trace event that could be logged?

49
00:02:47,643 --> 00:02:52,110
Where in the registry is that SearchIndexer process accessing?

50
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:56,577
Now of course this is a huge amount of resources that SearchIndexer

51
00:02:56,577 --> 00:02:59,311
is touching because it's such a pervasive service,

52
00:02:59,311 --> 00:03:04,285
so much so that I know some people who disable it in Windows Client.

53
00:03:04,285 --> 00:03:05,400
I don't recommend that.

54
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,443
I would never do that myself because I rely upon Windows Search so heavily.

55
00:03:09,443 --> 00:03:14,084
So like I said, the theme goes on here, and it actually will keep,

56
00:03:14,084 --> 00:03:16,251
Resource Monitor will keep your selection,

57
00:03:16,251 --> 00:03:19,371
so you can then go to each subsystem individually.

58
00:03:19,371 --> 00:03:23,944
In this case, it's showing how much RAM SearchIndexer is using,

59
00:03:23,944 --> 00:03:26,200
and it's actually using quite a bit.

60
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,167
I'm not surprised.

61
00:03:27,167 --> 00:03:30,818
Search does in fact exert a pretty good hold on the system.

62
00:03:30,818 --> 00:03:33,207
And we have disk and network.

63
00:03:33,207 --> 00:03:35,596
Let me select OneDrive for instance,

64
00:03:35,596 --> 00:03:38,265
and we can drill down and look and see what kind of

65
00:03:38,265 --> 00:03:40,346
network activity that process is doing.

66
00:03:40,346 --> 00:03:42,800
In my system it's very quiet.

67
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,637
What TCP connections are involved.

68
00:03:44,637 --> 00:03:47,208
Notice that the remote port is 443.

69
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:50,781
That means that OneDrive is completely firewall friendly.

70
00:03:50,781 --> 00:03:53,100
You know that SSL/TLS uses TCP 443,

71
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:57,433
but this can be a good spot to look at a suspicious

72
00:03:57,433 --> 00:03:59,956
process and its associated TCP connections.

73
00:03:59,956 --> 00:04:00,263
Frankly,

74
00:04:00,263 --> 00:04:03,022
I don't normally think of Reliability Monitor as a

75
00:04:03,022 --> 00:04:04,803
troubleshooting tool as far as malware,

76
00:04:04,803 --> 00:04:08,290
but it actually could be very helpful for that indeed.

77
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:09,995
So that's Reliability Monitor.

78
00:04:09,995 --> 00:04:11,549
Before we look at Performance Monitor,

79
00:04:11,549 --> 00:04:15,503
I want to go out to the Sysinternals live page,

80
00:04:15,503 --> 00:04:16,216
live.

81
00:04:16,216 --> 00:04:16,930
sysinternals.

82
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:17,643
com.

83
00:04:17,643 --> 00:04:20,397
We've looked at a few of these tools thus far,

84
00:04:20,397 --> 00:04:22,746
we've look at, in particular, auto runs,

85
00:04:22,746 --> 00:04:26,964
and I did show you Process Explorer, but I want to bring that back.

86
00:04:26,964 --> 00:04:28,073
I want to re-download it.

87
00:04:28,073 --> 00:04:33,513
I'm going to bring down Process Explorer 64, that's the 64-bit version.

88
00:04:33,513 --> 00:04:37,230
I'm going to save it to my desktop, I'm going to open it as an administrator,

89
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:42,128
we'll confirm that, and this is an alternative to using Resource Monitor.

90
00:04:42,128 --> 00:04:45,290
It does have a learning curve associated with it though.

91
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:47,449
I like it because it's hoverable.

92
00:04:47,449 --> 00:04:52,786
Notice that these service hosts are oftentimes difficult to figure out which

93
00:04:52,786 --> 00:04:56,327
services each service host process is actually hosting,

94
00:04:56,327 --> 00:04:59,172
but here nothing is left to the imagination.

95
00:04:59,172 --> 00:05:00,349
It tells you exactly.

96
00:05:00,349 --> 00:05:02,410
And this one I'm hovering over now,

97
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:05,061
it looks like all it's doing is Plug and Play.

98
00:05:05,061 --> 00:05:09,991
This next one looks like it has quite a bit going on, DCOM, System Event Broker.

99
00:05:09,991 --> 00:05:15,031
You can look at these processes and focus them on a particular CPU core,

100
00:05:15,031 --> 00:05:17,477
that's what called processor affinity.

101
00:05:17,477 --> 00:05:19,922
You can Kill, Restart, Suspend the process.

102
00:05:19,922 --> 00:05:24,163
You can go to Properties, and again, this is another course unto itself.

103
00:05:24,163 --> 00:05:29,667
As far as looking at the Performance metrics for that process, it's all here.

104
00:05:29,667 --> 00:05:32,860
The threads, the TCP ports, the strings,

105
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:36,185
it's all here in Sysinternals Process Explorer.

106
00:05:36,185 --> 00:05:39,611
I wanted to double underline that tool.

107
00:05:39,611 --> 00:05:41,873
My colleague and friend, Sami Laiho,

108
00:05:41,873 --> 00:05:44,405
does Sysinternals training for us at Pluralsight,

109
00:05:44,405 --> 00:05:47,638
so you can remediate those skills if they need remediation.

110
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:50,987
Final thing we're going to do is Performance Monitor, or PerfMon.

111
00:05:50,987 --> 00:05:57,435
I'm going to open Run and type PerfMon, one of many ways to open this tool.

112
00:05:57,435 --> 00:06:02,421
Performance Monitor has a live view, that's the Performance Monitor as such,

113
00:06:02,421 --> 00:06:06,693
and then there's Data Collector Sets where you can run a

114
00:06:06,693 --> 00:06:10,027
Performance Monitor trace and save the results.

115
00:06:10,027 --> 00:06:12,928
What you're seeing on screen here are live results that

116
00:06:12,928 --> 00:06:14,782
will go away when you're finished.

117
00:06:14,782 --> 00:06:17,643
And it shows you percent processor time by default,

118
00:06:17,643 --> 00:06:21,490
and you know that it's been that way since before the turn of the century,

119
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:25,362
since the late '90s, even I dare say mid '90s.

120
00:06:25,362 --> 00:06:27,795
Performance Monitor has been around and percent

121
00:06:27,795 --> 00:06:30,096
processor time has always been the default.

122
00:06:30,096 --> 00:06:31,983
Now in the interest of time,

123
00:06:31,983 --> 00:06:35,303
we can't really deep dive on this as much as I want to,

124
00:06:35,303 --> 00:06:37,863
but we have plenty of deep training in our library.

125
00:06:37,863 --> 00:06:39,848
And what I want to say is,

126
00:06:39,848 --> 00:06:43,981
Performance Monitor first of all focuses on the local computer,

127
00:06:43,981 --> 00:06:47,065
but you can absolutely browse and hit a remote box.

128
00:06:47,065 --> 00:06:50,475
You do that here, this is one spot to do it in the Add Counters.

129
00:06:50,475 --> 00:06:54,649
These counters refer to metrics that you can load in.

130
00:06:54,649 --> 00:06:59,368
The specific counters are rolled up under what are called objects.

131
00:06:59,368 --> 00:07:02,103
So we have this Processor object,

132
00:07:02,103 --> 00:07:05,078
and then underneath that Processor object class,

133
00:07:05,078 --> 00:07:07,164
we have all sorts of instances.

134
00:07:07,164 --> 00:07:12,459
So for CPU, for instance, you could look at just CPU 0,

135
00:07:12,459 --> 00:07:17,947
CPO 1, CPU 1 rather, or across All instances or Total.

136
00:07:17,947 --> 00:07:21,417
And the specific objects you see here are going to depend

137
00:07:21,417 --> 00:07:23,138
upon what software you have installed.

138
00:07:23,138 --> 00:07:25,071
There's a whole bunch of these, hundreds,

139
00:07:25,071 --> 00:07:26,859
that are just natively in Windows,

140
00:07:26,859 --> 00:07:30,592
but then as you install additional software that reads

141
00:07:30,592 --> 00:07:34,722
into the Performance Monitor system, I have SQL Server installed,

142
00:07:34,722 --> 00:07:38,850
so you'll see I can load up counters for SQL Server here all day long.

143
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:41,171
Then there's some SMB, did you see that?

144
00:07:41,171 --> 00:07:45,592
SMB Server Shares, Server Sessions, you load up your counters,

145
00:07:45,592 --> 00:07:47,788
and they'll show up as different colored lines,

146
00:07:47,788 --> 00:07:49,435
but you can change the view.

147
00:07:49,435 --> 00:07:51,273
There's three different ways to show the view.

148
00:07:51,273 --> 00:07:55,834
You can open and look at a Histogram bar, or you could look at a report.

149
00:07:55,834 --> 00:07:58,248
Being colorblind, this is what I like to see here,

150
00:07:58,248 --> 00:08:01,347
and each time it updates, it presents some new data.

151
00:08:01,347 --> 00:08:03,836
So Performance Monitor is cool for that.

152
00:08:03,836 --> 00:08:08,372
Performance Monitor is also cool because it allows you to view logged data,

153
00:08:08,372 --> 00:08:12,285
and you can view that logged data from a saved log file.

154
00:08:12,285 --> 00:08:14,359
Where do you get the log file?

155
00:08:14,359 --> 00:08:15,841
That's under Data Collector Sets.

156
00:08:15,841 --> 00:08:18,507
This is where you can set a Performance Monitor

157
00:08:18,507 --> 00:08:20,350
trace to happen locally or remotely.

158
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:21,942
These DCSs, as they're called,

159
00:08:21,942 --> 00:08:24,036
you have a bucket for any that you create from scratch,

160
00:08:24,036 --> 00:08:26,486
and then there's some that are here by default.

161
00:08:26,486 --> 00:08:32,309
There's one called System Diagnostics and one called System Performance.

162
00:08:32,309 --> 00:08:34,511
If I double left-click the Performance Counter,

163
00:08:34,511 --> 00:08:40,549
we can see which counters have been added into this System Diagnostics DCS.

164
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:43,333
And at first blush you think, well that's not a whole lot.

165
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:47,516
It looks like we're going to grab counters on Process,

166
00:08:47,516 --> 00:08:49,007
PhysicalDisk, Processor, Memory, System,

167
00:08:49,007 --> 00:08:51,957
but if you're familiar with what the star means,

168
00:08:51,957 --> 00:08:55,115
that means all Processes, all PhysicalDisks,

169
00:08:55,115 --> 00:08:56,167
all processors.

170
00:08:56,167 --> 00:08:58,703
It's going to be an enormous amount of data.

171
00:08:58,703 --> 00:09:03,495
So when you run a DCS, or Data Collector Set, you want to put bounds on it.

172
00:09:03,495 --> 00:09:05,096
When you look at the properties of one,

173
00:09:05,096 --> 00:09:08,738
one of the things you can do is create a schedule if you want it to recur,

174
00:09:08,738 --> 00:09:11,769
and you also want to make sure to set a stop condition.

175
00:09:11,769 --> 00:09:15,022
You can have it stop after a certain amount of time,

176
00:09:15,022 --> 00:09:20,577
and then you could even have a task happen when the data collector sets stops.

177
00:09:20,577 --> 00:09:23,734
A notification task, a PowerShell script, whatever.

178
00:09:23,734 --> 00:09:27,409
Long story short, Performance Monitor is super useful,

179
00:09:27,409 --> 00:09:31,873
but the main caveat is which counters best suit the

180
00:09:31,873 --> 00:09:34,070
need that you're working with?

181
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:36,354
Are you doing troubleshooting, and if so, what kind?

182
00:09:36,354 --> 00:09:38,933
Are you doing performance tuning and optimization?

183
00:09:38,933 --> 00:09:40,085
If so, what kind?

184
00:09:40,085 --> 00:09:42,388
With all of those counters to choose from,

185
00:09:42,388 --> 00:09:46,580
you're going to need some guidance on the highest

186
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:48,443
impact Performance Monitor counters.

187
00:09:48,443 --> 00:09:52,180
Check the exercise files because I give you some heads-up links on that.

188
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:56,398
Your goal is that you want to choose enough counters to give you a good,

189
00:09:56,398 --> 00:09:59,896
well-rounded baseline picture of what's happening on the target system,

190
00:09:59,896 --> 00:10:03,477
but you don't want to bring back too much data because then

191
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:05,901
the signal to noise ratio gets too big,

192
00:10:05,901 --> 00:10:14,000
and you just don't have --- it's too difficult really to look for trends and to spot problems.
