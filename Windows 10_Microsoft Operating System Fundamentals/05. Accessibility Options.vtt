00:00:01.578 --> 00:00:04.568
Special Purpose Settings.

2
00:00:04.568 --> 00:00:05.370
As you know,

3
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.042
this module is about configuring a system and you now

4
00:00:08.042 --> 00:00:10.759
know that we have the Control Panel,

5
00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:15.354
which is a graphical front-end to what happens under the hood in the Registry,

6
00:00:15.354 --> 00:00:19.306
and I wanted to just give special notice to certain Control Panels

7
00:00:19.306 --> 00:00:22.733
that may not be something you use very often,

8
00:00:22.733 --> 00:00:27.036
but they can be very helpful to particular populations of users.

9
00:00:27.036 --> 00:00:31.833
We're seeing here in Windows 95 Microsoft began in this OS version to

10
00:00:31.833 --> 00:00:35.614
start to give accessibility options to the end user,

11
00:00:35.614 --> 00:00:39.050
the ability to give users who have maybe motor problems with their

12
00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.687
fingers the ability to more carefully or to have more time let's

13
00:00:43.687 --> 00:00:45.736
say to press keys on the keyboard,

14
00:00:45.736 --> 00:00:48.674
maybe they have the display show up in a higher

15
00:00:48.674 --> 00:00:51.198
contrast to make the mouse pointer larger.

16
00:00:51.198 --> 00:00:55.252
All of these accessibility options have been tweaked and tuned over the

17
00:00:55.252 --> 00:00:59.625
years from 95 all the way to Windows 10 and it's really nice that

18
00:00:59.625 --> 00:01:03.223
Microsoft cares about their users to that point.

19
00:01:03.223 --> 00:01:07.211
This is a screenshot from the Windows 10 Accessibility Helper screen.

20
00:01:07.211 --> 00:01:10.902
You know by now that we have a separation of duties between the

21
00:01:10.902 --> 00:01:15.012
classic Control Panel items and the settings in Windows 10 and

22
00:01:15.012 --> 00:01:17.348
how that can be kind of confusing.

23
00:01:17.348 --> 00:01:17.675
Similarly,

24
00:01:17.675 --> 00:01:21.940
we have the accessibility options split across the two interfaces as well.

25
00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.702
The ease of access center is a one-stop shop where you can

26
00:01:25.702 --> 00:01:29.680
customize all sorts of options for people who have various

27
00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.719
physical challenges with their computer.

28
00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:33.120
In the settings app,

29
00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.813
we have the other options under ease of access and this shows you

30
00:01:37.813 --> 00:01:41.278
specifically being able to turn animations on or off.

31
00:01:41.278 --> 00:01:43.737
Whether or not you want to show the Windows background,

32
00:01:43.737 --> 00:01:47.706
I myself am quite colorblind and I have a difficult time if the Windows

33
00:01:47.706 --> 00:01:49.960
background is a super like a kaleidoscope pattern,

34
00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.102
I'm really not going to be able to see anything that's

35
00:01:53.102 --> 00:01:55.148
going in the desktop in that case.

36
00:01:55.148 --> 00:01:58.770
Likewise, I've worn glasses since I was 7 years old or so,

37
00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:06.000
so cursor thickness is just generally something that I'll want to boost a bit to make it easier to see.
