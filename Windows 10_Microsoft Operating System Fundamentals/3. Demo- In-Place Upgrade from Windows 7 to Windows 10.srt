1
00:00:02,572 --> 00:00:05,576
Okay, here we are on a Windows 7 desktop computer.

2
00:00:05,576 --> 00:00:09,373
You see on the taskbar I have Microsoft Office installed.

3
00:00:09,373 --> 00:00:10,807
That's a Microsoft application,

4
00:00:10,807 --> 00:00:13,637
so I'm not particularly concerned about it working.

5
00:00:13,637 --> 00:00:16,749
You'll see I have some freeware or shareware installed.

6
00:00:16,749 --> 00:00:20,138
I have Auslogics Disk Defrag, and I've got WinZip,

7
00:00:20,138 --> 00:00:22,490
so I've installed some software to simulate,

8
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:26,943
in a weak way, what a typical home or business system might look like.

9
00:00:26,943 --> 00:00:30,633
Windows Explorer, we'll go into documents, and I have some ping files.

10
00:00:30,633 --> 00:00:32,902
So this is just to set the stage.

11
00:00:32,902 --> 00:00:35,496
Our goal is to upgrade to Windows 10.

12
00:00:35,496 --> 00:00:39,395
We know that Windows 7 can be directly upgraded to Windows 10,

13
00:00:39,395 --> 00:00:42,652
so we have a few different ways of doing that.

14
00:00:42,652 --> 00:00:45,512
We used to have the Windows update free upgrade approach,

15
00:00:45,512 --> 00:00:46,875
but that window has passed.

16
00:00:46,875 --> 00:00:48,782
So a couple things you can do,

17
00:00:48,782 --> 00:00:51,567
you can download the media creation tool for Windows 10.

18
00:00:51,567 --> 00:00:52,681
That's a fee download.

19
00:00:52,681 --> 00:00:55,744
Check the exercise files for the link if you want it.

20
00:00:55,744 --> 00:01:00,132
You also can procure a physical DVD or the Windows 10

21
00:01:00,132 --> 00:01:03,101
media or an electronic version, and ISO image file.

22
00:01:03,101 --> 00:01:06,935
If I go to my computer you see I actually have one

23
00:01:06,935 --> 00:01:08,701
mounted in this virtual machine.

24
00:01:08,701 --> 00:01:13,369
If I right-click it I can fire off AutoPlay to kick off the upgrade,

25
00:01:13,369 --> 00:01:16,909
but I suggest strongly that you disable AutoPlay.

26
00:01:16,909 --> 00:01:19,137
There's a number of security reasons for that,

27
00:01:19,137 --> 00:01:22,895
not the least of which if you're given an infected USB

28
00:01:22,895 --> 00:01:26,635
stick and you have AutoPlay enabled, then any executable code,

29
00:01:26,635 --> 00:01:28,354
boom, you're done, you see?

30
00:01:28,354 --> 00:01:32,112
I don't like AutoPlay anymore, but if we just open it you see we have a setup.

31
00:01:32,112 --> 00:01:32,760
exe file.

32
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,084
Cool.

33
00:01:33,084 --> 00:01:36,156
Well, we need to know some things, first of all,

34
00:01:36,156 --> 00:01:38,295
and by things what are we talking about?

35
00:01:38,295 --> 00:01:40,702
Well how about what edition we're currently running.

36
00:01:40,702 --> 00:01:44,224
Let me open the Start menu here, go over to Computer,

37
00:01:44,224 --> 00:01:48,604
right-click, go to Properties, and we see that I'm running Windows 7 Pro.

38
00:01:48,604 --> 00:01:52,011
So that means I'm going to have some problems if I'm using

39
00:01:52,011 --> 00:01:55,214
Windows 10 or if I want to use Windows 10 Home I'm going to

40
00:01:55,214 --> 00:01:57,849
want to go to at least Windows 10 Pro.

41
00:01:57,849 --> 00:02:02,006
The ISO I have is, in fact, Windows 10 Professional edition.

42
00:02:02,006 --> 00:02:04,578
The Media Creation Tool, if you download that,

43
00:02:04,578 --> 00:02:07,438
that's going to automagically determine which edition

44
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:10,754
matches the one that you currently have.

45
00:02:10,754 --> 00:02:14,184
Now if we decided afterwards that we didn't want to do Pro,

46
00:02:14,184 --> 00:02:18,001
but we wanted to move up to Enterprise you can always do that.

47
00:02:18,001 --> 00:02:21,787
Now as I started the Media Creation Tool it looks like I've got a problem here.

48
00:02:21,787 --> 00:02:24,297
We weren't able to download all the files.

49
00:02:24,297 --> 00:02:26,667
I'll bet I have a network connection problem,

50
00:02:26,667 --> 00:02:31,376
and sure enough, if I hover over my networking icon it says,

51
00:02:31,376 --> 00:02:32,649
No internet access.

52
00:02:32,649 --> 00:02:34,304
So I'm going to pause the video.

53
00:02:34,304 --> 00:02:36,195
This is a good learning example for us.

54
00:02:36,195 --> 00:02:40,585
We want to sort this stuff out before we kick off the upgrade.

55
00:02:40,585 --> 00:02:42,386
Okay, that's fine, and if you're wondering,

56
00:02:42,386 --> 00:02:44,682
Tim, how did you resolve that networking problem?

57
00:02:44,682 --> 00:02:49,872
Let me ask you instead to search the Pluralsight library in the CompTIA A+

58
00:02:49,872 --> 00:02:52,737
or the Network+ training and look for troubleshooting,

59
00:02:52,737 --> 00:02:54,827
and I'll teach you all about it there,

60
00:02:54,827 --> 00:02:58,701
but if I hover over the icon we see that we now have internet access.

61
00:02:58,701 --> 00:03:02,474
Why is internet access required for the Media Creation Tool?

62
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:06,920
Well, this Media Creation Tool executable is actually quite tiny.

63
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:10,700
What this will do is actually download the ISO disk

64
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,212
image from Microsoft directly.

65
00:03:12,212 --> 00:03:13,297
You see what I mean?

66
00:03:13,297 --> 00:03:15,299
You have to accept the end user license agreement,

67
00:03:15,299 --> 00:03:19,403
which I will do, and then after a few moments we're asked what you want to do.

68
00:03:19,403 --> 00:03:22,839
Do you want to do an upgrade or do you want to create installation media,

69
00:03:22,839 --> 00:03:27,575
USB flash, DVD, or just a straight ahead ISO for another PC?

70
00:03:27,575 --> 00:03:31,111
If I choose Upgrade this PC now it's going to download,

71
00:03:31,111 --> 00:03:32,928
which is going to take a while,

72
00:03:32,928 --> 00:03:35,385
it's going to perform some preliminary compatibility checks,

73
00:03:35,385 --> 00:03:37,704
and then it's going to continue.

74
00:03:37,704 --> 00:03:39,133
I'm going to bomb out of this.

75
00:03:39,133 --> 00:03:41,802
I wanted to show you at least a couple different ways

76
00:03:41,802 --> 00:03:43,883
to perform this in-place upgrade.

77
00:03:43,883 --> 00:03:47,862
If you have access to the DVD for Windows 10 or the ISO

78
00:03:47,862 --> 00:03:50,571
image you can just simply kick off set up.

79
00:03:50,571 --> 00:03:53,315
Now we're going to talk about user Account Control

80
00:03:53,315 --> 00:03:55,279
in greater detail in a moment.

81
00:03:55,279 --> 00:03:58,366
Because I'm logged on to the system as an administrator,

82
00:03:58,366 --> 00:04:01,307
and you absolutely do need to be logged on to your system as

83
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:05,834
an administrator to perform an upgrade, I hope that almost goes without saying.

84
00:04:05,834 --> 00:04:09,451
That User Account Control is asking, are you sure you want to do this?

85
00:04:09,451 --> 00:04:13,675
And I have to explicitly answer yes to kick off that process.

86
00:04:13,675 --> 00:04:18,395
Now I'll talk more about some pre-flight checks after this demo,

87
00:04:18,395 --> 00:04:20,402
and I have a reason for doing it that way,

88
00:04:20,402 --> 00:04:22,954
but one of the things to check besides the editions,

89
00:04:22,954 --> 00:04:25,684
besides whether you're logged on as an administrator,

90
00:04:25,684 --> 00:04:30,171
make sure your system is fully up to date with Windows Update.

91
00:04:30,171 --> 00:04:33,563
This is a Windows 7 box that's completely up to date.

92
00:04:33,563 --> 00:04:33,991
Nonetheless,

93
00:04:33,991 --> 00:04:37,838
notice that the Windows 10 setup from the ISO

94
00:04:37,838 --> 00:04:40,382
volunteers to download and install updates,

95
00:04:40,382 --> 00:04:41,652
and that's recommended.

96
00:04:41,652 --> 00:04:45,344
I know I did that, so I can bypass this in this window.

97
00:04:45,344 --> 00:04:47,263
Another thing that you'll want to do is make sure that

98
00:04:47,263 --> 00:04:49,305
your anti-malware scanner is turned off.

99
00:04:49,305 --> 00:04:52,378
An upgrade is much different from just installing,

100
00:04:52,378 --> 00:04:54,873
say, Microsoft office on your system.

101
00:04:54,873 --> 00:04:58,317
Here you're modifying the system files and the boot files.

102
00:04:58,317 --> 00:05:02,556
Now if you're running a Windows anti-malware client it's less important.

103
00:05:02,556 --> 00:05:03,988
I have defender, for instance.

104
00:05:03,988 --> 00:05:07,979
So if I start Windows Defender on this machine and go to Tools,

105
00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:09,679
and then go to Options,

106
00:05:09,679 --> 00:05:15,077
I can turn off automatic scanning and real-time protection and disable it.

107
00:05:15,077 --> 00:05:17,825
Perhaps even go into Services and turn off the service,

108
00:05:17,825 --> 00:05:18,959
but like I said,

109
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:21,736
because it's a Microsoft product it's aware of what's

110
00:05:21,736 --> 00:05:25,320
going on here in the execution world, so I'll click Next.

111
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:25,629
Again,

112
00:05:25,629 --> 00:05:28,410
we have the preliminary check that takes place that

113
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:30,159
gives us some user friendly text.

114
00:05:30,159 --> 00:05:33,932
And again, I have to laugh how friendly and conversational the interface is.

115
00:05:33,932 --> 00:05:37,985
If you date back, like I do, to several versions of Windows,

116
00:05:37,985 --> 00:05:40,652
back in Windows NT days for instance,

117
00:05:40,652 --> 00:05:45,018
it was a user interface that even the strongest

118
00:05:45,018 --> 00:05:47,443
propeller head would find objectionable.

119
00:05:47,443 --> 00:05:51,384
Okay, now this Windows 10 DVD has multiple editions on it.

120
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:55,002
Looks like it has Education, Enterprise, and Pro.

121
00:05:55,002 --> 00:05:58,673
Want to make sure that I'm in the correct region, English US.

122
00:05:58,673 --> 00:06:02,041
En is code for a European version.

123
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:05,656
The European versions have all the base features,

124
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:09,294
but they don't have Windows Media Player and other stuff.

125
00:06:09,294 --> 00:06:10,888
There's some legal reasons for that.

126
00:06:10,888 --> 00:06:14,333
Now because we know that I'm running Windows 7 Pro I'm going

127
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:17,097
to do a direct upgrade to Windows 10 Pro,

128
00:06:17,097 --> 00:06:19,453
so I'll select that image from the list,

129
00:06:19,453 --> 00:06:20,337
and click Next.

130
00:06:20,337 --> 00:06:22,495
Again, we're asked about license terms.

131
00:06:22,495 --> 00:06:24,539
Depending upon how your licensing works,

132
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:28,820
by the way, and that's another whole subject that's really beyond our scope,

133
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:32,879
we can reuse the existing key for the previous version,

134
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:37,262
and activate Windows 10 automatically over the web or you'll

135
00:06:37,262 --> 00:06:39,788
have to have a Windows 10 activation key,

136
00:06:39,788 --> 00:06:44,067
a valid one, ready to supply in order to activate Windows 10.

137
00:06:44,067 --> 00:06:47,890
The set up routine has given us a driver warning here saying that

138
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:51,010
this video driver is not compatible with Windows 10,

139
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:54,770
and we have to confirm that incompatibility before we go along,

140
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:56,763
and that's fine in this case.

141
00:06:56,763 --> 00:06:58,620
It's nice that you get those flags,

142
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:02,319
but in an enterprise business if you're going to do this across dozens

143
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,928
or hundreds of machines you want to make sure to test all this before

144
00:07:06,928 --> 00:07:09,031
you're actually upgrading a user's computer.

145
00:07:09,031 --> 00:07:13,521
We're ready to install, and notice that it says, keep personal files and apps.

146
00:07:13,521 --> 00:07:14,936
This is an in-place upgrade.

147
00:07:14,936 --> 00:07:19,970
If we click Change what to keep we can choose to keep personal files and apps,

148
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:23,992
that's the default setting, just the files and nuke the applications,

149
00:07:23,992 --> 00:07:26,746
or nothing, which is almost a clean installation,

150
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:29,436
except you still get to keep your user account.

151
00:07:29,436 --> 00:07:31,883
I'm going to go back, accept the terms,

152
00:07:31,883 --> 00:07:35,329
make sure that keep personal files and apps is selected,

153
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:36,861
and we'll go Next.

154
00:07:36,861 --> 00:07:37,159
Okay,

155
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:39,837
once we're happy with our settings we can click

156
00:07:39,837 --> 00:07:41,964
Install to initiate the upgrade process.

157
00:07:41,964 --> 00:07:45,334
We're warned that the PC will restart several times,

158
00:07:45,334 --> 00:07:47,748
and the process might take a while.

159
00:07:47,748 --> 00:07:51,814
Now it's been several minutes, and we're 39% of the way there thus far.

160
00:07:51,814 --> 00:07:54,302
We haven't had a restart yet, but I'm expecting it.

161
00:07:54,302 --> 00:07:59,455
I'm just sipping my coffee and eating some cheddar rice cakes.

162
00:07:59,455 --> 00:08:03,427
Pardon the weird resolution, but we're coming back from a restart.

163
00:08:03,427 --> 00:08:07,527
I think Windows 10 is attempting to figure out the proper resolution.

164
00:08:07,527 --> 00:08:12,296
Actually, we saw that there was that error regarding the video driver earlier.

165
00:08:12,296 --> 00:08:12,602
Hmm.

166
00:08:12,602 --> 00:08:13,826
We'll keep monitoring it.

167
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:16,783
After a couple more restarts and updates we're here.

168
00:08:16,783 --> 00:08:19,397
We're working with low resolution of course,

169
00:08:19,397 --> 00:08:22,717
that's why you're seeing the black at the side of your display,

170
00:08:22,717 --> 00:08:24,568
but we can correct that quickly enough.

171
00:08:24,568 --> 00:08:29,272
I'm going to click Next to verify that I want to logon as my current account.

172
00:08:29,272 --> 00:08:30,922
We'll accept the license agreement,

173
00:08:30,922 --> 00:08:34,782
and we're now given what I guess you could call a mini setup

174
00:08:34,782 --> 00:08:36,957
wizard that's asking us a number of questions,

175
00:08:36,957 --> 00:08:41,679
how much we want to opt in to things like location identification,

176
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:45,887
Cortana and speech recognition allowing anonymous

177
00:08:45,887 --> 00:08:49,093
diagnostics being sent to Microsoft to help them,

178
00:08:49,093 --> 00:08:49,894
relevant ads.

179
00:08:49,894 --> 00:08:51,503
I'm certainly going to turn that off.

180
00:08:51,503 --> 00:08:55,176
I don't like ads at all, but I'll leave the others on for now,

181
00:08:55,176 --> 00:08:56,610
and I will use Cortana.

182
00:08:56,610 --> 00:09:00,458
Remember, we saw this earlier in the course that Cortana is really great,

183
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:04,636
but first you have to give her, I hate to use her,

184
00:09:04,636 --> 00:09:06,144
give it proper permissions.

185
00:09:06,144 --> 00:09:09,407
We have the ability to choose default applications

186
00:09:09,407 --> 00:09:13,154
here for media and web browser.

187
00:09:13,154 --> 00:09:18,367
I'll click Next, and lastly we're presented with the Windows 10 log on screen.

188
00:09:18,367 --> 00:09:20,690
I'll provide my password and authenticate.

189
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:24,203
We're notified that some updates are here for our PC.

190
00:09:24,203 --> 00:09:28,301
Okay, so we're going to have to sit through a run of Windows Update,

191
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:30,653
this time for Windows 10.

192
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:32,936
Alright, and finally we have a desktop.

193
00:09:32,936 --> 00:09:35,930
Now the in-place upgrade made a couple changes.

194
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:41,134
One is that it replaced the Pluralsight desktop wallpaper that I had

195
00:09:41,134 --> 00:09:44,663
previously with this that's the default Windows 10 wallpaper.

196
00:09:44,663 --> 00:09:49,396
As far as preserving my applications the short cuts are certainly still there.

197
00:09:49,396 --> 00:09:53,516
I had opened up Auslogics disk defrag in Windows 7.

198
00:09:53,516 --> 00:09:54,820
Let's open it now.

199
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:59,240
The User Account Control dialog is Windows 10 as opposed to Windows 7,

200
00:09:59,240 --> 00:09:59,612
obviously.

201
00:09:59,612 --> 00:10:00,727
There it is.

202
00:10:00,727 --> 00:10:05,102
That's fine, and then Windows Explorer or File Explorer,

203
00:10:05,102 --> 00:10:06,370
as it's called nowadays.

204
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:07,639
We'll go to Documents.

205
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:10,268
There's those ping files that I had before.

206
00:10:10,268 --> 00:10:11,833
So there you have it.

207
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:14,650
An in-place upgrade from Windows 7 to Windows 10.

208
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:18,865
Pretty painless, but of course, I have a relatively simple system.

209
00:10:18,865 --> 00:10:23,557
The more highly customized your system is with hardware and software the

210
00:10:23,557 --> 00:10:30,000
more potential for something going wrong there is. So due diligence is your watch word okay?
