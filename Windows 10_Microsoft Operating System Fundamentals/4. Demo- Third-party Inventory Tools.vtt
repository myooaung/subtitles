00:00:01.446 --> 00:00:04.006
I'm going to close this demo by showing you some

2
00:00:04.006 --> 00:00:06.905
third-party tools that are useful in this space.

3
00:00:06.905 --> 00:00:08.496
One is Piriform Speccy.

4
00:00:08.496 --> 00:00:11.808
This is a piece of freeware that in a nice,

5
00:00:11.808 --> 00:00:15.542
graphical way, shows you what's going on in terms of your hardware,

6
00:00:15.542 --> 00:00:18.585
your RAM, your usage, your graphics card,

7
00:00:18.585 --> 00:00:21.014
your storage subsystem, your audio.

8
00:00:21.014 --> 00:00:26.401
It's a nice way to get pretty interactive output as a sanity check

9
00:00:26.401 --> 00:00:28.514
when you're looking for hardware on a machine.

10
00:00:28.514 --> 00:00:31.588
I'm sure you could get that to run as a standalone

11
00:00:31.588 --> 00:00:33.692
program that you could put on, say,

12
00:00:33.692 --> 00:00:36.856
a USB stick that you keep in your technician toolkit.

13
00:00:36.856 --> 00:00:41.223
Another tool that's been around for a long time is CPU-Z,

14
00:00:41.223 --> 00:00:46.738
that's C-P-U -Z, and this gets really deep into inspecting your motherboard,

15
00:00:46.738 --> 00:00:49.871
telling you all about your installed processor,

16
00:00:49.871 --> 00:00:52.699
its caches, motherboard metadata, memory,

17
00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:56.564
graphics, even some performance benchmarking information.

18
00:00:56.564 --> 00:00:58.199
Really nice tool.

19
00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.015
One more tool is Sysinternals Process Explorer.

20
00:01:02.015 --> 00:01:04.250
What I've done is downloaded the executable.

21
00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:10.256
It's just a standalone executable called Proc, P-r-o-c, exp64.

22
00:01:10.256 --> 00:01:10.923
exe.

23
00:01:10.923 --> 00:01:12.694
I also downloaded sigcheck64.

24
00:01:12.694 --> 00:01:16.236
exe and kept them in the same location,

25
00:01:16.236 --> 00:01:20.037
and the great benefit there is that we can load up our Process Explorer.

26
00:01:20.037 --> 00:01:24.120
If you've never seen this before, this is like Task Manager on steroids.

27
00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.215
You can bring out some additional columns, verify image signatures.

28
00:01:28.215 --> 00:01:31.757
It can actually check whether the code's been digitally signed.

29
00:01:31.757 --> 00:01:34.192
This shows all your running processes by the way,

30
00:01:34.192 --> 00:01:37.776
and whether or not they've been signed could be indicative of

31
00:01:37.776 --> 00:01:40.444
malware versus software that you can trust,

32
00:01:40.444 --> 00:01:43.237
and you can also display virus totals.

33
00:01:43.237 --> 00:01:46.686
VirusTotal, what happens is, if you choose that,

34
00:01:46.686 --> 00:01:49.193
let's see, Options VirusTotal, Submit,

35
00:01:49.193 --> 00:01:53.257
it'll send hashes for unknown executable processes,

36
00:01:53.257 --> 00:01:55.810
and if it recognizes the hash,

37
00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.118
compares it against 60-odd different malware scanners and tells

38
00:01:59.118 --> 00:02:02.300
you if it raises an alarm with any of them.

39
00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.413
And fortunately, you see 0 for all of these entries,

40
00:02:05.413 --> 00:02:07.034
which makes me feel pretty darn good.

41
00:02:07.034 --> 00:02:09.912
But we can go very far down the rabbit hole with this.

42
00:02:09.912 --> 00:02:12.700
I thought it was apropos in our discussion of inventorying

43
00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.035
hardware and software in Windows 10 because this leaves

44
00:02:17.035 --> 00:02:21.165
absolutely nothing to the imagination, and you can get very deep.

45
00:02:21.165 --> 00:02:23.605
If for instance, you run an inventory,

46
00:02:23.605 --> 00:02:28.061
you detect some software that's nonstandard or that you didn't expect,

47
00:02:28.061 --> 00:02:30.212
so-called a shadow IT installation,

48
00:02:30.212 --> 00:02:40.000
and then with something like Process Explorer you can dig in and find out exactly what that executable is doing on your system.
