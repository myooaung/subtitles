1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:05,412
In this demonstration, we'll look at System Restore in Windows 10,

2
00:00:05,412 --> 00:00:09,302
and I have us here at the Microsoft Development Network or MSDN website.

3
00:00:09,302 --> 00:00:11,729
I gave you the URL in the exercise files.

4
00:00:11,729 --> 00:00:16,743
Remember I mentioned that System Restore technically looks at file extensions.

5
00:00:16,743 --> 00:00:20,652
A file extension, you might recall, is normally a three letter,

6
00:00:20,652 --> 00:00:21,949
an alphanumeric string,

7
00:00:21,949 --> 00:00:26,276
a three-character suffix to files that serve as an association

8
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:29,741
point between that file type and an application.

9
00:00:29,741 --> 00:00:34,013
Oftentimes files can be handled by multiple applications, like HTML files.

10
00:00:34,013 --> 00:00:36,892
But anyway, this is a pretty comprehensive list,

11
00:00:36,892 --> 00:00:40,153
a lot of executable code here that gets picked up,

12
00:00:40,153 --> 00:00:43,803
a lot of files with extensions that might be unfamiliar to you,

13
00:00:43,803 --> 00:00:45,700
it's a pretty big list, but anyway,

14
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:47,636
I just wanted to show you that for completeness.

15
00:00:47,636 --> 00:00:51,396
The end user experience to System Restore, let's get this show on the road.

16
00:00:51,396 --> 00:00:55,962
I'm going to do a Windows key + Q to open up Cortana and type system restore.

17
00:00:55,962 --> 00:01:01,113
It wants to open up the Create a restore point in the classic Control Panel.

18
00:01:01,113 --> 00:01:06,358
This technically opens the System Control Panel to the System Protection tab.

19
00:01:06,358 --> 00:01:10,809
Now the System Restore button will actually start the System Restore wizard.

20
00:01:10,809 --> 00:01:15,005
Down below, though, you first have to make sure that you're protecting a disk.

21
00:01:15,005 --> 00:01:19,181
Normally for System Restore this is going to be your system disk, your C drive.

22
00:01:19,181 --> 00:01:22,536
You can toggle protection from off to on just by

23
00:01:22,536 --> 00:01:25,271
selecting the volume and clicking configure.

24
00:01:25,271 --> 00:01:29,803
I have my system drive already turned on, so I'll click Configure.

25
00:01:29,803 --> 00:01:33,358
This is where you can turn System Protection on or off and adjust

26
00:01:33,358 --> 00:01:36,623
the disk space used for those restore points.

27
00:01:36,623 --> 00:01:40,424
Now in some troubleshooting cases, when a machine has been compromised,

28
00:01:40,424 --> 00:01:42,430
say, with malware for a long time,

29
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:45,557
you might just want to delete all previously created restore

30
00:01:45,557 --> 00:01:48,548
points for the drive and then start over.

31
00:01:48,548 --> 00:01:51,514
In my case, I'm allocating about 2.

32
00:01:51,514 --> 00:01:56,332
5 GB max usage for the system restore points on that volume.

33
00:01:56,332 --> 00:01:59,694
You can manually create a restore point here by clicking Create.

34
00:01:59,694 --> 00:02:01,234
It asks you to give it a name.

35
00:02:01,234 --> 00:02:03,241
I'll call this PreWinZip.

36
00:02:03,241 --> 00:02:07,254
Now there's a reason why I'm saying PreWinZip.

37
00:02:07,254 --> 00:02:09,318
It says Creating a restore point.

38
00:02:09,318 --> 00:02:11,038
So it's snapshotting the system,

39
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,333
remember it's monitoring a whole bunch of extensions,

40
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:15,939
it's not picking up any user files.

41
00:02:15,939 --> 00:02:18,994
The restore point was created successfully, awesome.

42
00:02:18,994 --> 00:02:21,252
What I'm going to do is go out to Edge,

43
00:02:21,252 --> 00:02:23,689
and I'm going to download the WINZIP extraction utility.

44
00:02:23,689 --> 00:02:27,860
I'm going to run it in place, quickly get this application installed,

45
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:30,162
let me close out of System Restore.

46
00:02:30,162 --> 00:02:31,143
I'll be darned,

47
00:02:31,143 --> 00:02:34,856
it looks like the smart screen filter is not allowing this

48
00:02:34,856 --> 00:02:39,270
installation to complete because it says the file contains a

49
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:41,337
virus or potentially unwanted software.

50
00:02:41,337 --> 00:02:45,135
That's one of the problems that you find with freeware and shareware,

51
00:02:45,135 --> 00:02:49,413
is that oftentimes in order to make money the software vendor will

52
00:02:49,413 --> 00:02:53,245
include or inject money-making software in there.

53
00:02:53,245 --> 00:02:55,500
I mean, I don't know anymore details about this,

54
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,670
I'm not knocking WINZIP specifically, but you saw what just happened,

55
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:00,182
and I'm glad it happened,

56
00:03:00,182 --> 00:03:04,831
because it looks like we have some WINZIP remnants in our system.

57
00:03:04,831 --> 00:03:06,690
there's a shortcut created on our desktop,

58
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:11,184
and this would be a good case where we want to rollback using System Restore.

59
00:03:11,184 --> 00:03:15,314
So, again, I'll use win key + Q, system restore Enter,

60
00:03:15,314 --> 00:03:18,360
and this time I'll launch the System Restore tool,

61
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,960
and let's step through here.

62
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,463
It gives us a list of restore points.

63
00:03:22,463 --> 00:03:26,130
I have my PreWinZip one that was a manually created one.

64
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:30,352
Notice that an automatic restore point took place a coulee days ago,

65
00:03:30,352 --> 00:03:32,426
that was snapshotted by the system.

66
00:03:32,426 --> 00:03:35,342
I'm going to, actually this is kind of cool,

67
00:03:35,342 --> 00:03:37,569
Scan for affected programs, let's click that.

68
00:03:37,569 --> 00:03:40,769
This is a good sanity check before just blindly rushing

69
00:03:40,769 --> 00:03:43,211
forth with a System Restore restore,

70
00:03:43,211 --> 00:03:49,061
and it hasn't detected any possible breakages if we remove any files.

71
00:03:49,061 --> 00:03:52,098
Programs and drivers that will be deleted, None detected.

72
00:03:52,098 --> 00:03:56,439
Well, didn't, was it more than just that shortcut that WinZip gave us?

73
00:03:56,439 --> 00:03:59,072
Maybe not, maybe it was just the desktop app.

74
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,725
Let me run a little test here.

75
00:04:00,725 --> 00:04:02,889
I'm going to create a text file called text.

76
00:04:02,889 --> 00:04:03,163
txt,

77
00:04:03,163 --> 00:04:07,102
and I'm going to put some junk text in here just to prove and

78
00:04:07,102 --> 00:04:11,266
demonstrate that we're not going to lose any user data here.

79
00:04:11,266 --> 00:04:14,493
Let's select PreWinZip and actually I just realized,

80
00:04:14,493 --> 00:04:18,569
I want to show you, I'm sorry about all of the actuallies here.

81
00:04:18,569 --> 00:04:20,245
What I'm thinking as I'm going through here,

82
00:04:20,245 --> 00:04:23,530
I don't use a script as an instructor because I think my training

83
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:25,758
is much more effective when it's spontaneous,

84
00:04:25,758 --> 00:04:29,623
but I realized there's three days between this initial restore point,

85
00:04:29,623 --> 00:04:34,084
and wonder if there's been anything that will show up in the affected programs

86
00:04:34,084 --> 00:04:38,490
and drivers list if we choose to go back in time 2 days,

87
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:40,553
instead of just 2 minutes.

88
00:04:40,553 --> 00:04:43,903
Nope, this has been a pretty quiet system, I must admit.

89
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:48,925
So, anyway, we'll select PreWinZip and click Next, and Finish.

90
00:04:48,925 --> 00:04:50,643
It tells us that once started you can't interrupt it,

91
00:04:50,643 --> 00:04:52,552
are you sure you want to do that?

92
00:04:52,552 --> 00:04:53,469
I'll say Yes.

93
00:04:53,469 --> 00:04:54,996
Preparing to restore your system.

94
00:04:54,996 --> 00:04:56,754
It's going to force a restart here,

95
00:04:56,754 --> 00:05:00,243
so I'll let that take place and we'll log in together.

96
00:05:00,243 --> 00:05:02,407
System Restore is initializing, okay.

97
00:05:02,407 --> 00:05:06,018
Okay, we've restarted, time to log onto the system.

98
00:05:06,018 --> 00:05:07,622
System Restore completed successfully.

99
00:05:07,622 --> 00:05:11,729
The system has been restored to this particular date and time.

100
00:05:11,729 --> 00:05:13,832
Your documents have not been affected.

101
00:05:13,832 --> 00:05:15,247
Right, so that text.

102
00:05:15,247 --> 00:05:17,369
txt file is still here untouched,

103
00:05:17,369 --> 00:05:23,075
but that stub loader that we saw from WINZIP is conspicuously absent.

104
00:05:23,075 --> 00:05:25,219
Now the good thing about System Restore is,

105
00:05:25,219 --> 00:05:29,485
as long as you take a restore point before you roll back any restores,

106
00:05:29,485 --> 00:05:32,461
you can move forward in time as well.

107
00:05:32,461 --> 00:05:36,797
You would Start + Q, System Restore, step through the wizard again,

108
00:05:36,797 --> 00:05:40,199
and actually even better than that it looks like the wizard

109
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:42,851
detected that we just ran a System Restore,

110
00:05:42,851 --> 00:05:51,000
and we can undo it directly or we can choose a different restore point. Very handy indeed.
