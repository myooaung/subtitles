00:00:00.563 --> 00:00:01.021
Okay,

2
00:00:01.021 --> 00:00:05.146
in this demonstration we're going to tour the Microsoft

3
00:00:05.146 --> 00:00:07.280
learning site so you can get your grounding.

4
00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.845
Now I recommended you looking at my MVA class on

5
00:00:10.845 --> 00:00:12.649
preparing for Microsoft certification.

6
00:00:12.649 --> 00:00:14.832
That advice still stands.

7
00:00:14.832 --> 00:00:18.687
However, you should have the site microsoft.

8
00:00:18.687 --> 00:00:19.788
com/learning bookmarked.

9
00:00:19.788 --> 00:00:21.023
This takes you to this site,

10
00:00:21.023 --> 00:00:24.765
and if it doesn't look exactly the way that it appears on my recorded screen,

11
00:00:24.765 --> 00:00:28.585
don't worry about it, Microsoft, like most big businesses,

12
00:00:28.585 --> 00:00:30.684
periodically refreshes their website.

13
00:00:30.684 --> 00:00:32.080
The main structure, though,

14
00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.612
of the learning toolbar is pretty consistent over time.

15
00:00:35.612 --> 00:00:39.445
I want to focus under Certifications & exams,

16
00:00:39.445 --> 00:00:42.215
specifically, they're divided into categories.

17
00:00:42.215 --> 00:00:43.009
There's an About,

18
00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:46.800
where you can get to the exam policies and the frequently asked questions.

19
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.849
That's particularly important for you to go to.

20
00:00:49.849 --> 00:00:54.077
And then we have a number of cloud platform and infrastructure certifications,

21
00:00:54.077 --> 00:00:56.692
Mobility, Data management, Productivity,

22
00:00:56.692 --> 00:00:58.000
App building.

23
00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.103
Under Certification types,

24
00:00:59.103 --> 00:01:03.942
this is where you can get to those credentials that we had talked about.

25
00:01:03.942 --> 00:01:07.662
For IT pros that would be MTA, MTSA, and MCSE.

26
00:01:07.662 --> 00:01:12.682
Let's go to MTA, because that's our scope under consideration,

27
00:01:12.682 --> 00:01:17.764
and while that's loading I'm going to pop open an additional tab and do a

28
00:01:17.764 --> 00:01:22.561
search for exam 98-349 Windows Operating System Fundamentals.

29
00:01:22.561 --> 00:01:25.835
Apologies if I sometimes call it Essentials.

30
00:01:25.835 --> 00:01:28.965
The reason I want to have the exam page open in a separate tab

31
00:01:28.965 --> 00:01:31.130
is so I don't forget to tell you about it.

32
00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.232
Back at the Microsoft Learning page, when you go into the,

33
00:01:34.232 --> 00:01:38.875
what did we do, we went down under Certification types,

34
00:01:38.875 --> 00:01:43.708
MTA, it shows that as of this recording we have MTAs in Database,

35
00:01:43.708 --> 00:01:48.024
Developer, and IT Infrastructure, and you can click through to explore them.

36
00:01:48.024 --> 00:01:49.600
And that's all well and good,

37
00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.882
but as I said earlier in the slide section of this module,

38
00:01:52.882 --> 00:01:56.697
it can be a little slippery to learn the status about 98-349,

39
00:01:56.697 --> 00:02:01.014
it's difficult to find it on the Microsoft Learning site,

40
00:02:01.014 --> 00:02:03.338
so what I tend to do is, as you saw me do,

41
00:02:03.338 --> 00:02:05.401
do a search for the exam number, 98-349,

42
00:02:05.401 --> 00:02:08.685
and then it brings you to the Learning page.

43
00:02:08.685 --> 00:02:13.185
Now what's cool about the blueprint is that it answers most of your questions.

44
00:02:13.185 --> 00:02:15.303
I receive questions from students every day,

45
00:02:15.303 --> 00:02:18.247
can you tell me what's covered on such and so exam.

46
00:02:18.247 --> 00:02:21.286
Well, of course I'm not going to break my non-disclosure agreement,

47
00:02:21.286 --> 00:02:22.795
or NDA, with Microsoft,

48
00:02:22.795 --> 00:02:28.475
but if you go to the blueprint page for the certification in question,

49
00:02:28.475 --> 00:02:29.818
it'll leave nothing to the imagination.

50
00:02:29.818 --> 00:02:35.394
Here we can see all of the languages that Microsoft has localized the exam in.

51
00:02:35.394 --> 00:02:37.235
There is a schedule link right here.

52
00:02:37.235 --> 00:02:40.032
Now notice that this says Schedule with Certiport.

53
00:02:40.032 --> 00:02:42.008
That's an important distinction.

54
00:02:42.008 --> 00:02:43.647
Most exams use Pearson VUE.

55
00:02:43.647 --> 00:02:50.005
For instance, let me look up a Microsoft Windows Server 2016 exam 70-744,

56
00:02:50.005 --> 00:02:56.730
this is a security exam in the MCSA/MCSE tracks.

57
00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.105
I'll select the link, let's load it up.

58
00:02:59.105 --> 00:03:01.372
Okay, notice it just says Schedule exam,

59
00:03:01.372 --> 00:03:02.991
and when you click that,

60
00:03:02.991 --> 00:03:06.660
it's actually going to eventually click out to pearsonvue.

61
00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.664
com, which is the official Microsoft partner for scheduling these exams.

62
00:03:11.664 --> 00:03:15.849
And if you've taken previous Microsoft exams, you already know that.

63
00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:18.586
Well I don't actually want to schedule it so I'm going to stop it,

64
00:03:18.586 --> 00:03:23.259
but Certiport is the vendor that Microsoft uses for simulation

65
00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:26.586
exams like the Microsoft Office Specialist test.

66
00:03:26.586 --> 00:03:29.426
So what that should tell you is that in addition to

67
00:03:29.426 --> 00:03:31.097
the typical multiple choice items,

68
00:03:31.097 --> 00:03:35.821
you can expect to see simulation items on your 98-349 test,

69
00:03:35.821 --> 00:03:39.595
ad that underscores the Cert Triangle,

70
00:03:39.595 --> 00:03:43.739
where you're flexing not only your theoretical knowledge of Windows 10,

71
00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:45.537
but your actual hands-on experience.

72
00:03:45.537 --> 00:03:49.643
There's no way around it, you need to demonstrate your competency.

73
00:03:49.643 --> 00:03:52.092
So those are the major touch points there.

74
00:03:52.092 --> 00:03:54.439
The last thing I'll do is come down here,

75
00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:56.003
and on every exam blueprint page,

76
00:03:56.003 --> 00:03:59.152
the most important section is the Skills measured.

77
00:03:59.152 --> 00:04:04.010
And as we saw, there's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 objective domains,

78
00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.822
and when you expand them they contain specific categories and skills.

79
00:04:08.822 --> 00:04:13.224
You want to make sure before you sit for any Microsoft certification exam,

80
00:04:13.224 --> 00:04:16.459
that you've gone through every one of these line items,

81
00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:18.235
and every element in every line,

82
00:04:18.235 --> 00:04:22.545
and make sure that you understand it and know how to use that technology.

83
00:04:22.545 --> 00:04:26.380
If you come down under Skills measured, Preparation options,

84
00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:31.319
Practice test, Take a Microsoft Official Practice Test for 98-349,

85
00:04:31.319 --> 00:04:33.576
that's going to click out to measureup.

86
00:04:33.576 --> 00:04:33.898
com.

87
00:04:33.898 --> 00:04:38.270
Specifically, Pearson VUE has a subsite called mindhub,

88
00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:42.772
and they partner with measureup to offer certification exams.

89
00:04:42.772 --> 00:04:44.175
Here it is right here.

90
00:04:44.175 --> 00:04:47.275
This gives you that third part of the certification triangle.

91
00:04:47.275 --> 00:04:49.410
You've got the theoretical knowledge,

92
00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.683
you've got the hands-on practical experience,

93
00:04:51.683 --> 00:05:04.000
and then by using a legitimate practice exam product like this, this gets you into the mind-frame of taking a computer-based certification test.
