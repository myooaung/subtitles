00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:04.100
Managing Hardware.

2
00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.236
The first aspect I want to cover with managing hardware,

3
00:00:07.236 --> 00:00:10.518
keeping in mind that this is not a PC hardware course,

4
00:00:10.518 --> 00:00:12.675
we're focused on the Windows 10 operating system,

5
00:00:12.675 --> 00:00:15.991
is that you should be aware of what the Windows 10

6
00:00:15.991 --> 00:00:18.228
Driver Store is and where it's located.

7
00:00:18.228 --> 00:00:21.162
We've talked a little bit in the past here and there about the fact

8
00:00:21.162 --> 00:00:23.913
that normally with hardware it's Plug and Play,

9
00:00:23.913 --> 00:00:26.846
that is, you install or plug in the hardware,

10
00:00:26.846 --> 00:00:30.909
and Windows will identify the device and pull a driver on its own,

11
00:00:30.909 --> 00:00:35.455
then going forward you can use Windows Update to keep those drivers up to date.

12
00:00:35.455 --> 00:00:39.251
In that first case where Windows gives you a driver on its own behalf,

13
00:00:39.251 --> 00:00:41.731
where exactly is it pulling those drivers?

14
00:00:41.731 --> 00:00:44.303
It's pulling them from the Windows 10 Driver Store,

15
00:00:44.303 --> 00:00:45.160
and by default,

16
00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.917
this is a repository located in the path

17
00:00:47.917 --> 00:00:48.948
C:/Windows/System32/DriverStore/FileRepository,

18
00:00:48.948 --> 00:00:54.077
and there's a whole bunch of folders,

19
00:00:54.077 --> 00:00:57.099
and many of those folders contain class drivers that

20
00:00:57.099 --> 00:00:59.674
fit multiple pieces of hardware.

21
00:00:59.674 --> 00:01:03.280
So it's not necessarily a one-to-one relation.

22
00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.006
In the enterprise, it's very possible, and it actually happens every workday,

23
00:01:07.006 --> 00:01:10.973
that if you have specific manufacturer drivers that you want to

24
00:01:10.973 --> 00:01:13.967
use and make available to Windows Plug and Play,

25
00:01:13.967 --> 00:01:17.230
you can stage those in the Windows 10 Driver Store

26
00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:19.172
on the machines that you manage.

27
00:01:19.172 --> 00:01:21.067
Failing that, as I said,

28
00:01:21.067 --> 00:01:29.000
Windows Update can also be used to pull current drivers directly from the internet.
