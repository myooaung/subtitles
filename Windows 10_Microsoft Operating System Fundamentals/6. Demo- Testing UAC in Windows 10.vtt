00:00:01.597 --> 00:00:03.989
In this demonstration we'll have a look at User Account

2
00:00:03.989 --> 00:00:06.180
Control or UAC security and adjusting it.

3
00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.758
I'm going to open up Start, and open up old fashioned control panel,

4
00:00:10.758 --> 00:00:13.281
and we'll open up Windows Defender Firewall.

5
00:00:13.281 --> 00:00:17.899
Remember that an action can either require administrative elevation or not.

6
00:00:17.899 --> 00:00:19.353
Note the shield here.

7
00:00:19.353 --> 00:00:20.444
Use recommended settings.

8
00:00:20.444 --> 00:00:21.903
When I click that,

9
00:00:21.903 --> 00:00:24.456
depending upon whether it's a Microsoft application

10
00:00:24.456 --> 00:00:25.945
or a third-party application,

11
00:00:25.945 --> 00:00:29.176
you're either prompted for confirmation or it just goes through.

12
00:00:29.176 --> 00:00:32.361
Let me open up the Start menu and find an application,

13
00:00:32.361 --> 00:00:33.702
a third-party application.

14
00:00:33.702 --> 00:00:36.384
How about the FileZilla FTP Client.

15
00:00:36.384 --> 00:00:38.680
The lack of a shield means that this will work just

16
00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.264
fine under standard user permissions, but if you need to manually elevate,

17
00:00:43.264 --> 00:00:48.077
if you know that it's going to require administrative level access,

18
00:00:48.077 --> 00:00:52.014
you can right-click and either choose Run as administrator

19
00:00:52.014 --> 00:00:54.850
directly from the shortcut menu or if you're in the start

20
00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.759
menu you'll have to go to More, Run as administrator,

21
00:00:57.759 --> 00:01:02.218
and here we're seeing the User Account Control secure desktop environment,

22
00:01:02.218 --> 00:01:05.271
and we're being prompted to confirm that,

23
00:01:05.271 --> 00:01:08.062
yes, this is what we want to do.

24
00:01:08.062 --> 00:01:10.208
I want you to get into the habit of reading this.

25
00:01:10.208 --> 00:01:13.061
Do you want to allow this app to make changes to your device?

26
00:01:13.061 --> 00:01:13.982
That's potential changes.

27
00:01:13.982 --> 00:01:17.781
I also want you to notice and verify the name of the program.

28
00:01:17.781 --> 00:01:20.370
First of all, see if the code has been signed,

29
00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:24.016
and second of all that it's a verified publisher.

30
00:01:24.016 --> 00:01:26.132
This is a really good software practice.

31
00:01:26.132 --> 00:01:29.162
If a piece of software has not been digitally signed,

32
00:01:29.162 --> 00:01:33.215
then there's really no easy way to tell whether it's been modified.

33
00:01:33.215 --> 00:01:37.769
Of course, the Windows Defender SmartScreen is one way to help in that,

34
00:01:37.769 --> 00:01:40.492
but digitally signed software is certainly the way to go.

35
00:01:40.492 --> 00:01:45.525
If we click No it's not going to start the program, and if we click Yes it will.

36
00:01:45.525 --> 00:01:48.399
Now UAC settings are managed a couple different places.

37
00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:52.946
If we just do a search for UAC in Cortana or Start there's

38
00:01:52.946 --> 00:01:55.010
Change User Account Control settings.

39
00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:56.926
It's a simple user interface.

40
00:01:56.926 --> 00:02:00.056
Notice that it slides down from Never notify,

41
00:02:00.056 --> 00:02:03.189
that is not recommended, you're, in effect,

42
00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:06.047
disabling UAC there, up to Always notify.

43
00:02:06.047 --> 00:02:08.496
The default is right about here.

44
00:02:08.496 --> 00:02:12.314
Notify me only when apps try to make changes to my computer.

45
00:02:12.314 --> 00:02:15.353
Don't notify me when I make changes to Windows settings.

46
00:02:15.353 --> 00:02:15.701
Well,

47
00:02:15.701 --> 00:02:20.208
I recommend keeping it up to Always notify because it's going to keep

48
00:02:20.208 --> 00:02:23.262
you more engaged in what's happening on your system.

49
00:02:23.262 --> 00:02:29.331
Notice that to change the setting itself requires UAC administrative elevation.

50
00:02:29.331 --> 00:02:31.556
The other place to go is Group Policy.

51
00:02:31.556 --> 00:02:35.357
In Local Group Policy you can open that from a command

52
00:02:35.357 --> 00:02:38.769
line or the Run box by typing gpedit.

53
00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:43.536
msc or in a domain environment you can open the Group Policy Management Console,

54
00:02:43.536 --> 00:02:47.318
and in Group Policy you go under Computer Configuration,

55
00:02:47.318 --> 00:02:50.025
Windows Settings, Security Settings, Security Options,

56
00:02:50.025 --> 00:02:55.446
and there's a whole lot of options here that start with User Account Control,

57
00:02:55.446 --> 00:02:57.751
and it looks like one's actually disabled,

58
00:02:57.751 --> 00:03:00.807
and then we have a couple other that are,

59
00:03:00.807 --> 00:03:02.607
actually a few are disabled.

60
00:03:02.607 --> 00:03:04.965
Hmm, well let's check out this first one.

61
00:03:04.965 --> 00:03:08.946
User Account Control: Allow UIAccess applications to prompt for

62
00:03:08.946 --> 00:03:11.758
elevation without using the secure desktop.

63
00:03:11.758 --> 00:03:13.889
I'm not sure why that's disabled.

64
00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:18.388
The default mode, though, is what's called Admin Approval Mode,

65
00:03:18.388 --> 00:03:20.016
where administrators, that is,

66
00:03:20.016 --> 00:03:23.361
members of the local administrators group on your Windows 10 box,

67
00:03:23.361 --> 00:03:25.710
are prompted to say yes or no,

68
00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:29.087
but they're not required to put in their credentials.

69
00:03:29.087 --> 00:03:33.627
This particular policy allows you to force the prompt of

70
00:03:33.627 --> 00:03:35.881
credentials or elevate without prompting.

71
00:03:35.881 --> 00:03:38.246
So I mean, there's a lot of granularity here,

72
00:03:38.246 --> 00:03:40.997
and this gets a little heavy into systems administration land,

73
00:03:40.997 --> 00:03:43.293
so I'm going to leave it at that,

74
00:03:43.293 --> 00:03:47.677
but group policy is where as a network --- as a systems administrator rather,

75
00:03:47.677 --> 00:03:51.605
you can centralize UAC behavior across your domain.

76
00:03:51.605 --> 00:03:53.990
Now let me, again, open up my User menu,

77
00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:57.591
I'm going to sign out, and I'm going to sign on as a domain user.

78
00:03:57.591 --> 00:03:59.551
So let me go down to Other user.

79
00:03:59.551 --> 00:04:00.776
I'm going to sign on.

80
00:04:00.776 --> 00:04:04.748
First of all, let me make sure I have an ordinary user account created.

81
00:04:04.748 --> 00:04:06.865
Let's switch back to my domain controller.

82
00:04:06.865 --> 00:04:11.964
Once again, this is my Windows 26 --- Windows Server 2016 box.

83
00:04:11.964 --> 00:04:13.698
I'm going to create a quick user here.

84
00:04:13.698 --> 00:04:15.215
It's nice for you to see this.

85
00:04:15.215 --> 00:04:20.148
I'm not going to explain every step because it's not necessary for our purposes.

86
00:04:20.148 --> 00:04:22.097
I'm going to create an account called Liz.

87
00:04:22.097 --> 00:04:26.925
I'm just going to set her password, and not force her to change it at next logon,

88
00:04:26.925 --> 00:04:28.028
and create the account.

89
00:04:28.028 --> 00:04:31.252
Now if I double left-click and navigate to the Member Of

90
00:04:31.252 --> 00:04:35.169
tab she's a member of Domain Users, and the way Active Directory works,

91
00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:36.029
it's really cool.

92
00:04:36.029 --> 00:04:36.795
By default,

93
00:04:36.795 --> 00:04:40.986
anybody in Domain Users will automatically be a part of the

94
00:04:40.986 --> 00:04:43.513
Users local group on their desktop machine.

95
00:04:43.513 --> 00:04:44.271
It's really cool.

96
00:04:44.271 --> 00:04:46.040
I can actually show that to you.

97
00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.778
So, once again, let's rinse and repeat.

98
00:04:48.778 --> 00:04:51.907
We're going to do a logon of Liz.

99
00:04:51.907 --> 00:04:53.826
I'm going to pause while this stuff happens.

100
00:04:53.826 --> 00:04:55.626
You don't want to see this again.

101
00:04:55.626 --> 00:04:58.651
Okay, so we're logged on as the domain user, Liz.

102
00:04:58.651 --> 00:05:01.544
Now she's not an administrator, so if I come over here,

103
00:05:01.544 --> 00:05:04.569
and I open Control Panel again, old school Control Panel,

104
00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:07.858
I'm going to change the view to small icons,

105
00:05:07.858 --> 00:05:10.819
and we'll open Windows Defender Firewall again.

106
00:05:10.819 --> 00:05:14.564
You'll see most everything has the User Account Control flag,

107
00:05:14.564 --> 00:05:16.809
like to turn the firewall off, for instance,

108
00:05:16.809 --> 00:05:20.590
and if I click a UAC protected item we get the secure desktop,

109
00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:23.925
and this time we're actually prompted to actually supply credentials,

110
00:05:23.925 --> 00:05:27.848
and if Liz doesn't know those credentials she can only answer no,

111
00:05:27.848 --> 00:05:32.599
but if I happen to be by I can come in and do my trainer account

112
00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:34.824
that I know does have administrative permissions,

113
00:05:34.824 --> 00:05:38.438
and then it will allow me to come in, okay?

114
00:05:38.438 --> 00:05:41.334
And just to finish my earlier point about the

115
00:05:41.334 --> 00:05:43.424
convenience of the Active Directory domain,

116
00:05:43.424 --> 00:05:47.302
let me do a search for the Computer Management console again.

117
00:05:47.302 --> 00:05:50.525
She should be able to open that as a standard user.

118
00:05:50.525 --> 00:05:53.195
Yep, she is, and if I go to Groups here,

119
00:05:53.195 --> 00:05:57.969
and come down to Users, look who belongs to the Users group automatically,

120
00:05:57.969 --> 00:06:01.113
Domain Users, and I'll show you the same thing,

121
00:06:01.113 --> 00:06:04.268
the built-in Administrators group in Windows Client will

122
00:06:04.268 --> 00:06:07.316
automatically have the Domain Admins group.

123
00:06:07.316 --> 00:06:15.000
Those happened when we joined this workstation to the company. pri domain.
