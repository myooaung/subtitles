00:00:01.953 --> 00:00:04.827
Windows 10 Upgrade Paths.

2
00:00:04.827 --> 00:00:08.891
An ideal operating system upgrade is going to be one in which all applications,

3
00:00:08.891 --> 00:00:11.743
data, and user preferences are maintained.

4
00:00:11.743 --> 00:00:16.176
We just came out of a demo in which I upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10,

5
00:00:16.176 --> 00:00:20.141
so you saw the bits in action, and you saw how the process works.

6
00:00:20.141 --> 00:00:23.221
We're now going to look in retrospect, in a way,

7
00:00:23.221 --> 00:00:26.034
and look at best practices for that process,

8
00:00:26.034 --> 00:00:31.190
how upgrade happens in the enterprise, and we'll also look at migration.

9
00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:33.759
The Windows 10 Upgrade Paths here.

10
00:00:33.759 --> 00:00:37.185
Now this is taken from the Microsoft literature.

11
00:00:37.185 --> 00:00:40.197
The URL for this is in your exercise files,

12
00:00:40.197 --> 00:00:44.626
and this simple table shows it's part of a fuller table that's at the

13
00:00:44.626 --> 00:00:47.472
Microsoft website that shows you different Windows 8.

14
00:00:47.472 --> 00:00:51.842
1 editions and whether you can do a full in-place upgrade

15
00:00:51.842 --> 00:00:54.968
migrating all personal data settings and applications,

16
00:00:54.968 --> 00:00:58.344
and normally the way it works is that corresponding

17
00:00:58.344 --> 00:01:02.455
versions work just fine together, so you would expect that Windows 8.

18
00:01:02.455 --> 00:01:05.742
1 Pro can upgrade to Windows 10 Pro just fine,

19
00:01:05.742 --> 00:01:09.774
and you'll notice that you can move up the SKU ladder,

20
00:01:09.774 --> 00:01:14.320
though maybe your business is growing, and right now you're users have Windows 8.

21
00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.422
1 Pro, but you want them to wind up with Enterprise.

22
00:01:17.422 --> 00:01:22.502
The theme here that I want to drill into your mind is to do your due diligence,

23
00:01:22.502 --> 00:01:24.346
if you don't mind the alliteration.

24
00:01:24.346 --> 00:01:27.719
Do your homework, and make sure that your upgrade path is supported.

25
00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:33.111
That term supported is important because supported means that you can file a

26
00:01:33.111 --> 00:01:36.340
support ticket with Microsoft and they'll actually help you.

27
00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:37.511
Long story short,

28
00:01:37.511 --> 00:01:41.999
a direct in-place upgrade is possible for Windows 7 and Windows 8.

29
00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:42.340
1.

30
00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.728
Now what if you're running Windows XP?

31
00:01:44.728 --> 00:01:46.360
I don't know if you know this,

32
00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.414
but Windows XP is officially a completely dead operating system.

33
00:01:49.414 --> 00:01:52.594
It's out of support, it's gone, but nonetheless,

34
00:01:52.594 --> 00:01:55.728
I'm always somewhat surprised to go in businesses and

35
00:01:55.728 --> 00:01:57.336
see that they're still running it.

36
00:01:57.336 --> 00:02:00.490
This is very dangerous because Microsoft is not updating

37
00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.860
or issuing Windows updates for XP, so if for no other reason,

38
00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.373
for security sake you need to get on at least Windows 7.

39
00:02:08.373 --> 00:02:13.208
In that case, you would go from XP to 7 or XP to 8.

40
00:02:13.208 --> 00:02:17.255
1, and then you could do an in-place upgrade to Windows 10.

41
00:02:17.255 --> 00:02:21.425
Also remember that the Windows 10 Education and S editions are

42
00:02:21.425 --> 00:02:24.717
specialized versions of Enterprise edition.

43
00:02:24.717 --> 00:02:28.190
Enterprise is where you get everything but the kitchen sink.

44
00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.454
It's intended for business; medium business,

45
00:02:31.454 --> 00:02:35.811
large business specifically, and it's purchased on a subscription basis,

46
00:02:35.811 --> 00:02:39.699
so the actual way you get an Enterprise license differs

47
00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:42.321
from how you would with home or even pro.

48
00:02:42.321 --> 00:02:42.879
For instance,

49
00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:46.930
you're not going to be able to go into your local electronics store

50
00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.645
and purchase a boxed DVD of Enterprise Edition.

51
00:02:50.645 --> 00:02:51.496
Here's another table.

52
00:02:51.496 --> 00:02:55.497
Let's just take a quick look and see if this makes sense here.

53
00:02:55.497 --> 00:02:58.989
This deals with how you would get a license.

54
00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:02.955
There's various ways that you can license your Windows 10 edition.

55
00:03:02.955 --> 00:03:05.899
Now if I were recording this training for you a year ago,

56
00:03:05.899 --> 00:03:07.950
closer to the release of Windows 10,

57
00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.036
you would be able to get a free in-place upgrade through Windows

58
00:03:12.036 --> 00:03:14.952
update of a qualifying version of Windows,

59
00:03:14.952 --> 00:03:16.774
namely Windows 7 or Windows 8.

60
00:03:16.774 --> 00:03:17.077
1.

61
00:03:17.077 --> 00:03:20.070
You would actually be prompted in the notification area,

62
00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.560
would you like to upgrade to Windows?

63
00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:23.849
That period has passed,

64
00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:27.531
so now it's going to be a question of purchasing a

65
00:03:27.531 --> 00:03:29.487
license from the Microsoft store.

66
00:03:29.487 --> 00:03:32.431
This could be the electronic store on your computer or you

67
00:03:32.431 --> 00:03:35.118
could go do a bricks and mortar Microsoft store if you

68
00:03:35.118 --> 00:03:36.552
have one in your local mall.

69
00:03:36.552 --> 00:03:40.490
This is going to be mainly for the consumer and small business environment,

70
00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:49.000
and any kind of medium to large business you'll likely have a licensing agreement directly with Microsoft.
