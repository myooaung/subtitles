1
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:04,379
In this demonstration, we'll work with network printing,

2
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:08,700
and I'm going to do the back-end work here in Windows Server 2016.

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:13,648
Now the Print Management app is available on Windows 10, you can install it.

4
00:00:13,648 --> 00:00:14,267
In fact,

5
00:00:14,267 --> 00:00:17,491
you can get all of the Windows Server 2016 management

6
00:00:17,491 --> 00:00:20,864
tools on the client by downloading what's called the

7
00:00:20,864 --> 00:00:23,095
Remote Server Administration Tools, or RSAT tools,

8
00:00:23,095 --> 00:00:27,301
but I'm going to do this natively on my Windows Server machine.

9
00:00:27,301 --> 00:00:29,900
I'm going to open Start and type print management,

10
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:33,306
and you can see right here, Print Management Desktop app.

11
00:00:33,306 --> 00:00:35,941
It's an old school Microsoft Management console,

12
00:00:35,941 --> 00:00:38,979
and you'll notice it has some sections here.

13
00:00:38,979 --> 00:00:41,406
We've got Print Management, and if we right-click this,

14
00:00:41,406 --> 00:00:43,346
we can go to Add/Remove Servers.

15
00:00:43,346 --> 00:00:45,932
Now dc1 is my local box.

16
00:00:45,932 --> 00:00:49,316
The idea here is that you can actually load in all of your

17
00:00:49,316 --> 00:00:50,989
organizational print server devices,

18
00:00:50,989 --> 00:00:54,562
these would be Windows Server machines that are hosting

19
00:00:54,562 --> 00:00:59,392
at least one network print queue, and manage them all in a single interface.

20
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:03,512
The Print Management console is a must-use utility if you're

21
00:01:03,512 --> 00:01:06,014
doing network printing in a Windows context,

22
00:01:06,014 --> 00:01:09,333
in particular in the context of an Active Directory domain.

23
00:01:09,333 --> 00:01:12,793
The filters are useful when you have a lot of print

24
00:01:12,793 --> 00:01:16,720
servers and a lot of printers, you can create custom view filters,

25
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,785
but I just have a single print server,

26
00:01:18,785 --> 00:01:22,259
so I'm going to open it up and you can see there

27
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:24,130
are separate buckets for drivers, forms,

28
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:26,302
which are essentially paper types,

29
00:01:26,302 --> 00:01:29,776
paper sizes that are supported by those printers.

30
00:01:29,776 --> 00:01:32,880
The drivers is going to be for any print devices

31
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,742
that are installed on this system.

32
00:01:34,742 --> 00:01:37,367
It gives you the specific driver version,

33
00:01:37,367 --> 00:01:39,991
it doesn't tell you type 4 necessarily.

34
00:01:39,991 --> 00:01:41,220
Then we have printers,

35
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:44,684
and on this server I just have the Microsoft Print to

36
00:01:44,684 --> 00:01:46,782
PDF and the XPS Document Writer.

37
00:01:46,782 --> 00:01:48,966
I'm going to create a synthetic, or fake,

38
00:01:48,966 --> 00:01:51,289
printer by right-clicking here and choosing Add Printer.

39
00:01:51,289 --> 00:01:55,198
We can either search the network or add what's called a TCP/IP port.

40
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:57,002
That's what I'm going to do.

41
00:01:57,002 --> 00:02:00,004
This is going to be a TCP-based printer,

42
00:02:00,004 --> 00:02:02,670
its IP address is going to be,

43
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:06,613
I'm not even sure what this machine's IP address is.

44
00:02:06,613 --> 00:02:12,305
Let me open an elevated PowerShell console really quickly and type ipconfig, 10.

45
00:02:12,305 --> 00:02:12,743
0.

46
00:02:12,743 --> 00:02:13,181
0.

47
00:02:13,181 --> 00:02:13,619
1.

48
00:02:13,619 --> 00:02:16,006
So my fake printer will be 10.

49
00:02:16,006 --> 00:02:16,346
0.

50
00:02:16,346 --> 00:02:16,687
0.

51
00:02:16,687 --> 00:02:17,028
100,

52
00:02:17,028 --> 00:02:20,698
and I'm going to deselect Auto detect because there is no

53
00:02:20,698 --> 00:02:23,620
printer that's on the network at that IP address.

54
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,123
Now what it would have in the real world,

55
00:02:25,123 --> 00:02:26,725
or what I would have I should say,

56
00:02:26,725 --> 00:02:30,025
is that I would have the device out plugged into a

57
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:31,671
switch and available on the network,

58
00:02:31,671 --> 00:02:34,377
and I would ensure that it gets this IP address,

59
00:02:34,377 --> 00:02:36,918
either by statically assigning it on the printer using

60
00:02:36,918 --> 00:02:38,359
the printer's physical interface,

61
00:02:38,359 --> 00:02:44,684
or I could create what's called an IP address reservation on my DHCP server,

62
00:02:44,684 --> 00:02:46,842
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol.

63
00:02:46,842 --> 00:02:49,325
It stills tries to detect, even if you tell it not to,

64
00:02:49,325 --> 00:02:50,926
and of course it's going to fail.

65
00:02:50,926 --> 00:02:53,130
Of course it wasn't able to find that device,

66
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:57,244
so we can override it by specifying a particular standalone

67
00:02:57,244 --> 00:03:00,510
Print Server or just a Generic Network Card.

68
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:03,425
Next, we're asked to identify a printer driver,

69
00:03:03,425 --> 00:03:07,807
and the only option that's available in this case is to install a new driver,

70
00:03:07,807 --> 00:03:09,269
and we'll do so manually.

71
00:03:09,269 --> 00:03:12,121
This dialog's been around for a long, long time.

72
00:03:12,121 --> 00:03:14,721
Now you'll notice that these are generic Class Drivers.

73
00:03:14,721 --> 00:03:16,852
It says so right in the definition.

74
00:03:16,852 --> 00:03:18,679
If you check the exercise files,

75
00:03:18,679 --> 00:03:22,238
I point you out to some documentation where you can store

76
00:03:22,238 --> 00:03:26,407
manufacturer's device-specific drivers in the driver store

77
00:03:26,407 --> 00:03:28,244
where Windows can get to them.

78
00:03:28,244 --> 00:03:32,463
But in this case, I'm just going to choose, at random, a Color LaserJet.

79
00:03:32,463 --> 00:03:36,249
If you have a device driver already on your server,

80
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:38,983
that's what the Have Disk option is all about.

81
00:03:38,983 --> 00:03:42,991
And again, that dialog box is so old it's amazing that it's still around.

82
00:03:42,991 --> 00:03:45,016
I'm going to call this laserjet1,

83
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:48,762
and you can actually share it directly from here,

84
00:03:48,762 --> 00:03:54,257
which I'll do, Laserjet1, and I'll say Second floor lobby,

85
00:03:54,257 --> 00:03:58,863
click Next, and then Next, and of course we can't print a test page,

86
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:01,375
so I'll leave that alone, and we'll click Finish.

87
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:03,255
So now we have a new shared printer here.

88
00:04:03,255 --> 00:04:04,597
What can we do with it?

89
00:04:04,597 --> 00:04:07,495
Well if we right-click that printer we can look at its queue,

90
00:04:07,495 --> 00:04:09,828
same dialog we looked at in the previous demo.

91
00:04:09,828 --> 00:04:10,967
We can manage sharing,

92
00:04:10,967 --> 00:04:14,350
which will bring you to the Sharing tab of its Properties sheet,

93
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:16,221
but if you want to get specific,

94
00:04:16,221 --> 00:04:21,018
you'll want to go to the Security tab and set NTFS-level permissions.

95
00:04:21,018 --> 00:04:22,876
Notice that these permissions are different from

96
00:04:22,876 --> 00:04:26,200
what we saw with files and folders, and that's as it should be.

97
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,952
You've got Print, that's the baseline permission,

98
00:04:28,952 --> 00:04:31,911
Mange this printer, Manage the document queue,

99
00:04:31,911 --> 00:04:33,246
or Special permissions.

100
00:04:33,246 --> 00:04:36,030
Your ordinary users should always have just Print.

101
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:39,226
If there's a brave soul who volunteers to manage the printer,

102
00:04:39,226 --> 00:04:40,678
the print queue, that's awesome.

103
00:04:40,678 --> 00:04:44,988
You can him, or her, or their group and allow for that permission as well.

104
00:04:44,988 --> 00:04:47,805
Now as far as deployment goes, check this out.

105
00:04:47,805 --> 00:04:51,064
You can directly from Print Management, Deploy with Group Policy.

106
00:04:51,064 --> 00:04:54,267
Now I'm not going to step through this whole wizard because we

107
00:04:54,267 --> 00:04:56,588
haven't formally treated the subject of Group Policy,

108
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:57,929
but suffice to say,

109
00:04:57,929 --> 00:05:02,621
this wizard will allow you to either create an existing Group Policy Object,

110
00:05:02,621 --> 00:05:05,906
or GPO, that includes this printer definition in it,

111
00:05:05,906 --> 00:05:08,899
or you could add it to an existing GPO,

112
00:05:08,899 --> 00:05:12,753
and then scope the Group Policy to hit only the users and

113
00:05:12,753 --> 00:05:15,263
computers that need access to that printer.

114
00:05:15,263 --> 00:05:16,358
Isn't that convenient?

115
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:18,888
During the next GPO refresh for your users,

116
00:05:18,888 --> 00:05:20,900
which normally be within 90 minutes,

117
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:23,885
they'll receive a new printer in their printer

118
00:05:23,885 --> 00:05:26,434
folder of this network print queue.

119
00:05:26,434 --> 00:05:27,785
Just easy peasy.

120
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:29,734
Now if you do need to manually intervene,

121
00:05:29,734 --> 00:05:35,728
what we can do on the client side is again open up that printer's wizard again,

122
00:05:35,728 --> 00:05:39,891
Printers and scanners, and go to The printer that I want isn't listed,

123
00:05:39,891 --> 00:05:42,733
this is just one of several ways to do it,

124
00:05:42,733 --> 00:05:46,831
please understand that, and we can Select a shared printer by name,

125
00:05:46,831 --> 00:05:51,216
\dc1, and then it actually fills in the print queues through auto complete.

126
00:05:51,216 --> 00:05:55,882
I'll just choose laserjet1 from the list, click Next, it's going to connect.

127
00:05:55,882 --> 00:05:58,296
Now depending upon what type driver this is,

128
00:05:58,296 --> 00:06:04,074
if it's type 3 or type 4, we'll either be downloading the driver from the server,

129
00:06:04,074 --> 00:06:08,675
or just installing it locally from this computer's driver store,

130
00:06:08,675 --> 00:06:13,209
or potentially through Windows Update, and this is a class driver actually.

131
00:06:13,209 --> 00:06:15,201
I just saw a notice of that.

132
00:06:15,201 --> 00:06:18,046
So now I have this connection to this shared printer.

133
00:06:18,046 --> 00:06:20,971
I shouldn't be able to manage it unless I'm an administrator.

134
00:06:20,971 --> 00:06:24,277
Come to think of it, my currently logged-on user,

135
00:06:24,277 --> 00:06:27,173
who is, expand the Start menu here, trainer,

136
00:06:27,173 --> 00:06:29,334
is in fact a domain administrator.

137
00:06:29,334 --> 00:06:33,032
So I do have full permissions on this network printer.

138
00:06:33,032 --> 00:06:35,254
And if I wanted to remove the connection,

139
00:06:35,254 --> 00:06:41,000
I can simply click Remove device, and without any confirmation, it's gone.
