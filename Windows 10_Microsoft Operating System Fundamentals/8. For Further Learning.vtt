For further learning in the Pluralsight library,

2
00:00:04.072 --> 00:00:08.089
you really can't go wrong by looking at Bruce Mackenzie-Low's stuff.

3
00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:12.417
He's a popular conference speaker and his work for Pluralsight is really great.

4
00:00:12.417 --> 00:00:15.976
He has a course called Windows Performance Monitoring Fundamentals.

5
00:00:15.976 --> 00:00:19.702
It's a 4-hour course, but I submit every minute is worthwhile.

6
00:00:19.702 --> 00:00:21.889
We also have Mike Pfeiffer's course,

7
00:00:21.889 --> 00:00:23.888
Maintaining and Monitoring Windows Server 2016.

8
00:00:23.888 --> 00:00:26.001
He covers all the tools we do,

9
00:00:26.001 --> 00:00:30.114
and the reason I point you to Mike's course is that I find as a student,

10
00:00:30.114 --> 00:00:33.005
sometimes I might pick up something from one instructor

11
00:00:33.005 --> 00:00:34.728
that I missed from a previous instructor,

12
00:00:34.728 --> 00:00:40.000
and I want to make sure to share the love with you for your maximum learning benefit.
