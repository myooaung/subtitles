00:00:01.946 --> 00:00:05.464
Having a local printer is all well and good until somebody puts an eye out,

2
00:00:05.464 --> 00:00:08.097
oh no, wait a minute, no.

3
00:00:08.097 --> 00:00:09.414
Let me rephrase.

4
00:00:09.414 --> 00:00:11.873
Having a local printer is fine if it's just your printer,

5
00:00:11.873 --> 00:00:14.400
but in a shared workgroup environment at work,

6
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.412
you're likely to share a bigger print device that offers more

7
00:00:18.412 --> 00:00:21.861
functionality and is generally more expensive than what the business

8
00:00:21.861 --> 00:00:24.195
can afford to give each user individually.

9
00:00:24.195 --> 00:00:27.047
It's frankly a waste to give each user their own printer when

10
00:00:27.047 --> 00:00:29.683
we can take advantage of network printing.

11
00:00:29.683 --> 00:00:32.284
First though, beginning in Windows 8,

12
00:00:32.284 --> 00:00:36.342
Microsoft invented a new driver specification call the V4 driver model.

13
00:00:36.342 --> 00:00:38.378
Now, at the end of this module,

14
00:00:38.378 --> 00:00:40.903
I'll point you to a related course in the Pluralsight

15
00:00:40.903 --> 00:00:43.801
library that has much better coverage on printer drivers

16
00:00:43.801 --> 00:00:46.644
and their history and operations, but for our purposes,

17
00:00:46.644 --> 00:00:51.213
I want you to know that this V4 driver model that's used in Windows 8,

18
00:00:51.213 --> 00:00:51.542
8.

19
00:00:51.542 --> 00:00:57.915
1, and 10 has some huge advantages over previous older printer driver models.

20
00:00:57.915 --> 00:00:59.695
Number one, in a network environment,

21
00:00:59.695 --> 00:01:02.257
the server doesn't send the driver to the client.

22
00:01:02.257 --> 00:01:06.588
The way it always has been historically is that the user goes to print,

23
00:01:06.588 --> 00:01:09.631
and if the client device, for whatever reason,

24
00:01:09.631 --> 00:01:12.299
doesn't have the driver for that network printer,

25
00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.444
it gets downloaded from the server.

26
00:01:14.444 --> 00:01:18.644
Well that can have many possible things that can go wrong.

27
00:01:18.644 --> 00:01:22.437
It's inefficient, especially for wide-area network connections.

28
00:01:22.437 --> 00:01:27.451
With V4 Driver Model, you have driver delivery not coming from the server,

29
00:01:27.451 --> 00:01:33.606
but either coming natively on each Windows 10 device using its driver store,

30
00:01:33.606 --> 00:01:37.412
or alternatively downloading the drivers from Windows Update.

31
00:01:37.412 --> 00:01:40.927
Now if you're wondering what W-S-U-S, or WSUS is,

32
00:01:40.927 --> 00:01:43.728
that's essentially a business version of Windows Update.

33
00:01:43.728 --> 00:01:45.897
We'll talk about that in due time.

34
00:01:45.897 --> 00:01:49.699
We also have with the V4 driver model the ability to get robust

35
00:01:49.699 --> 00:01:53.386
support for different printers with a single driver instead of the

36
00:01:53.386 --> 00:01:56.011
problem of having what we used to have,

37
00:01:56.011 --> 00:02:00.098
each print server would have multiple copies of the same driver,

38
00:02:00.098 --> 00:02:04.741
one for certain operating systems, one for another set of operating systems,

39
00:02:04.741 --> 00:02:07.938
one for 32-bit hardware, another for 64-bit hardware.

40
00:02:07.938 --> 00:02:12.976
We now have a one-to-many relationship as long as the printer manufacturer

41
00:02:12.976 --> 00:02:16.266
develops their driver to correspond to the V4 standard.

42
00:02:16.266 --> 00:02:19.271
The driver files are also smaller, or made more efficient.

43
00:02:19.271 --> 00:02:21.899
That's about all you need to know for a V4.

44
00:02:21.899 --> 00:02:23.046
Know that in general,

45
00:02:23.046 --> 00:02:26.566
as long as your client computers are running at least Windows 8 and

46
00:02:26.566 --> 00:02:35.000
your servers are running at least Windows Server 2012, you want to ensure that all of your print drivers are V4.
