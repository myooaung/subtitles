1
00:00:01,935 --> 00:00:06,361
Finally, we have Windows Mobility Center.

2
00:00:06,361 --> 00:00:10,541
The historical perspective here is around 2006 or so,

3
00:00:10,541 --> 00:00:13,544
Microsoft gave us the Vista operating system and there were

4
00:00:13,544 --> 00:00:15,979
quite a few advancements in that version,

5
00:00:15,979 --> 00:00:18,913
one of which was the Windows Mobility Center.

6
00:00:18,913 --> 00:00:21,178
By this time, in information technology,

7
00:00:21,178 --> 00:00:25,898
Microsoft saw that many of their customers were beginning to rely upon their

8
00:00:25,898 --> 00:00:29,446
laptop computers for business use or even not for business use,

9
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:34,283
maybe just for every day use out and about in different environments.

10
00:00:34,283 --> 00:00:37,267
So what Microsoft has done is give us this tool

11
00:00:37,267 --> 00:00:39,899
that looks like a bunch of tiles, doesn't it,

12
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:43,690
in fact, this one shows six tiles with room for two more.

13
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:47,487
This is actually an extensible application and you may find

14
00:00:47,487 --> 00:00:49,533
that your original equipment manufacturer,

15
00:00:49,533 --> 00:00:53,706
OEM, for instance, if it's a Dell laptop or an HP laptop,

16
00:00:53,706 --> 00:00:56,476
they may have extra items tucked into mobility center,

17
00:00:56,476 --> 00:01:00,049
so it's going to depend upon the make and model of your

18
00:01:00,049 --> 00:01:02,430
PC and how Windows 10 was installed.

19
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:06,055
The mobility center options really haven't changed all that much all the

20
00:01:06,055 --> 00:01:08,584
way up to Windows 10 as you'll see in the next demo,

21
00:01:08,584 --> 00:01:12,274
but basically, you can mute the volume very easily and quickly,

22
00:01:12,274 --> 00:01:15,766
you can check your battery status and change your power profile,

23
00:01:15,766 --> 00:01:18,834
this can be useful if you have to be on the battery for a while.

24
00:01:18,834 --> 00:01:20,861
You can adjust your Wi-Fi connectivity,

25
00:01:20,861 --> 00:01:24,513
you can connect to an external display and work with a projector,

26
00:01:24,513 --> 00:01:27,506
now that's something I do all the time being a trainer.

27
00:01:27,506 --> 00:01:31,647
And then Sync Center is an opportunity for you to force a sync if

28
00:01:31,647 --> 00:01:33,991
you're using a feature called offline files.

29
00:01:33,991 --> 00:01:37,640
Offline files is a business-oriented feature where you can take

30
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:41,504
files that you normally access across the network and have copies of

31
00:01:41,504 --> 00:01:45,059
them available locally on your laptop that you can access even when

32
00:01:45,059 --> 00:01:47,704
you're away from your business.

33
00:01:47,704 --> 00:01:49,824
Now what if you don't have a laptop,

34
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:52,843
but you still want to use that Mobility Center because it

35
00:01:52,843 --> 00:01:56,867
does have some pretty cool options, the ability to easily mute the volume,

36
00:01:56,867 --> 00:01:57,518
for instance.

37
00:01:57,518 --> 00:02:00,688
The bottom line is that Registry that we've been dealing with stores a

38
00:02:00,688 --> 00:02:06,597
whole lot of data about your computer including a sub repository called

39
00:02:06,597 --> 00:02:10,030
the common information model or SIM repository.

40
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:13,433
That's also sometimes called Windows Management Instrumentation,

41
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:17,043
or WMI repo, but all we need to know about that,

42
00:02:17,043 --> 00:02:18,027
SIM or WMI,

43
00:02:18,027 --> 00:02:21,349
is that Windows can tell whether you're running on a desktop or a

44
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:24,715
laptop computer based on that SIM repository data,

45
00:02:24,715 --> 00:02:27,905
and if Windows detects that you're on a laptop,

46
00:02:27,905 --> 00:02:29,190
you'll get Mobility Center.

47
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:32,269
If Windows detects that you're on a desktop computer,

48
00:02:32,269 --> 00:02:35,238
you won't, but we can tap in to the Registry,

49
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:37,553
specifically going into HKey Current User,

50
00:02:37,553 --> 00:02:41,071
Software, Microsoft, Mobile PC Mobility Center.

51
00:02:41,071 --> 00:02:43,556
We may need to create one or more of those subkeys,

52
00:02:43,556 --> 00:02:44,838
by the way, for instance,

53
00:02:44,838 --> 00:02:48,163
you might not have a mobile PC or a Mobility Center

54
00:02:48,163 --> 00:02:51,252
subkey so you would add those, one inside the other,

55
00:02:51,252 --> 00:02:53,497
and then inside the Mobility Center subkey,

56
00:02:53,497 --> 00:02:59,958
you would create a new D word or double word value called run on desktop.

57
00:02:59,958 --> 00:03:02,131
Now when you're creating new values in the Registry,

58
00:03:02,131 --> 00:03:04,420
you're going to want to watch your case,

59
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:07,544
your upper and lowercase, and you're definitely going to watch spaces,

60
00:03:07,544 --> 00:03:11,719
there is no spaces here, and you want to get the data type correct as well.

61
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:15,668
And then depending upon whether you have the value either deleted,

62
00:03:15,668 --> 00:03:19,464
which is disabled, or if you set it to one,

63
00:03:19,464 --> 00:03:28,000
that would enable Windows Mobility Center even on a desktop computer. There you have it, some Registry work in action.
