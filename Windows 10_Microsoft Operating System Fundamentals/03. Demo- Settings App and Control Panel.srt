1
00:00:02,528 --> 00:00:02,770
Okay,

2
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:05,680
I'd mentioned to you that I have a story to tell with

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,018
regard to Control Panel and settings.

4
00:00:08,018 --> 00:00:09,408
That's absolutely true.

5
00:00:09,408 --> 00:00:13,566
Let me begin that story just in Windows 10 land where we are right now.

6
00:00:13,566 --> 00:00:17,076
This is a Windows 10 enterprise edition machine that I'm using

7
00:00:17,076 --> 00:00:20,935
for this course that there are various entry points into the

8
00:00:20,935 --> 00:00:23,577
settings/Control Panel system, in other words,

9
00:00:23,577 --> 00:00:25,779
how you configure your system.

10
00:00:25,779 --> 00:00:26,712
In the previous module,

11
00:00:26,712 --> 00:00:30,776
I instructed you to get in the habit of right-clicking everything on the screen.

12
00:00:30,776 --> 00:00:34,149
For instance, if you right-click an empty area of the desktop,

13
00:00:34,149 --> 00:00:37,710
we have some options regarding display settings and personalize,

14
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:40,122
and if we hit Personalize,

15
00:00:40,122 --> 00:00:44,789
it takes you into settings specifically into personalization.

16
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:48,284
If you right-click and go to Display settings in the shortcut menu,

17
00:00:48,284 --> 00:00:52,223
it takes you into settings once again under System,

18
00:00:52,223 --> 00:00:52,661
Display.

19
00:00:52,661 --> 00:00:56,515
So those are ways to dive directly into what you're looking at,

20
00:00:56,515 --> 00:00:58,200
and again, the same rule applies,

21
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,396
right-click an empty area of the task bar and select

22
00:01:01,396 --> 00:01:04,041
task bar settings and there you go.

23
00:01:04,041 --> 00:01:07,067
Now to look at the settings application from the root level,

24
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,733
I could've actually done it from there come to think of it.

25
00:01:09,733 --> 00:01:11,289
Let me try that one more time.

26
00:01:11,289 --> 00:01:13,289
I'll right-click the empty area of the taskbar,

27
00:01:13,289 --> 00:01:14,618
select Taskbar settings,

28
00:01:14,618 --> 00:01:19,891
and then I'll click Home to go to the Windows Settings home page.

29
00:01:19,891 --> 00:01:24,063
I'll close that and come back to Start because another way to do

30
00:01:24,063 --> 00:01:26,755
the same thing is to click the settings gear,

31
00:01:26,755 --> 00:01:28,052
there you have it.

32
00:01:28,052 --> 00:01:29,673
Yet another thing to do.

33
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:33,205
I hope that you're enjoying the notification system in Windows 10,

34
00:01:33,205 --> 00:01:35,953
if you left-click the notifications icon,

35
00:01:35,953 --> 00:01:38,701
you'll find All settings right here.

36
00:01:38,701 --> 00:01:42,412
In addition to specific options, as I've said before,

37
00:01:42,412 --> 00:01:44,857
that open up specific settings areas.

38
00:01:44,857 --> 00:01:48,883
So all of this deals with the new Windows 10

39
00:01:48,883 --> 00:01:50,886
settings app and this is the home page.

40
00:01:50,886 --> 00:01:53,703
It looks kind of like a web page, doesn't it,

41
00:01:53,703 --> 00:01:55,834
and everything is hyperlinked, which again,

42
00:01:55,834 --> 00:01:56,899
is very webby.

43
00:01:56,899 --> 00:02:00,166
You see we have these options grouped by category.

44
00:02:00,166 --> 00:02:04,074
Now of course, we don't have the time or scope to go through every single option,

45
00:02:04,074 --> 00:02:04,405
instead,

46
00:02:04,405 --> 00:02:08,522
I'm giving you the power user skills such that you know how to

47
00:02:08,522 --> 00:02:11,972
navigate it and then how to determine where to find settings is

48
00:02:11,972 --> 00:02:14,407
going to be part of your practice actually.

49
00:02:14,407 --> 00:02:15,432
To that point though,

50
00:02:15,432 --> 00:02:17,902
check the exercise files because I have some documentation

51
00:02:17,902 --> 00:02:22,016
links that give you a ready reference and description of

52
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:23,302
every possible Windows setting.

53
00:02:23,302 --> 00:02:27,287
Now instead of trying to figure out which category you're going for,

54
00:02:27,287 --> 00:02:30,856
you can always come right up here to find a setting.

55
00:02:30,856 --> 00:02:33,488
What if you wanted to change the screen saver.

56
00:02:33,488 --> 00:02:37,883
You can start to type and one of the options should be what you're looking for.

57
00:02:37,883 --> 00:02:41,159
Here we have turn the lock screen slideshow on or off,

58
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:44,676
change screen saver, turn screen saver on or off.

59
00:02:44,676 --> 00:02:45,889
And looked what happened here.

60
00:02:45,889 --> 00:02:49,115
Here's a good example of that story I have to tell.

61
00:02:49,115 --> 00:02:52,115
Microsoft and specifically the Windows client product

62
00:02:52,115 --> 00:02:55,719
groups are slowly transitioning, and I do mean slowly,

63
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:58,840
transitioning the Windows settings from what historically

64
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,565
has been in the Control Panel applet.

65
00:03:01,565 --> 00:03:05,071
I'll put up a floating screenshot on the screen now so

66
00:03:05,071 --> 00:03:06,776
you can see what I'm talking about.

67
00:03:06,776 --> 00:03:11,259
What you're looking at now is the Control Panel collection in Windows 7 and

68
00:03:11,259 --> 00:03:15,957
that motif has been around all the way back to Windows 3.

69
00:03:15,957 --> 00:03:16,740
1, okay.

70
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:20,831
So it's been many years and I dare say most Windows users are

71
00:03:20,831 --> 00:03:23,690
accustomed to the traditional Control Panel.

72
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:26,193
Slowly as I said, beginning with Windows 8.

73
00:03:26,193 --> 00:03:30,197
1 that we've seen a migration of configuration settings going

74
00:03:30,197 --> 00:03:35,186
into this interface here where you can drill into categories

75
00:03:35,186 --> 00:03:38,728
and then they're nicely documented, they're nicely hyperlinked,

76
00:03:38,728 --> 00:03:41,383
I mean, they're fine, it's really nice.

77
00:03:41,383 --> 00:03:41,885
But yes,

78
00:03:41,885 --> 00:03:44,647
it's going to cause some confusion and it has when you

79
00:03:44,647 --> 00:03:47,181
suddenly get this old-fashioned interface here.

80
00:03:47,181 --> 00:03:51,297
This screen saver dialog has been like this for many, many years.

81
00:03:51,297 --> 00:03:52,901
You might be wondering, okay Tim,

82
00:03:52,901 --> 00:03:55,820
how do I know whether a particular configuration setting is

83
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:58,963
in the old Control Panel or in the new.

84
00:03:58,963 --> 00:04:02,991
Well I would suggest that you start with the new and then chances are

85
00:04:02,991 --> 00:04:06,659
good that you'll be clicked out to the old as need be.

86
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:08,702
I believe power might be an example.

87
00:04:08,702 --> 00:04:10,753
Yeah, in fact, if you've typed power,

88
00:04:10,753 --> 00:04:13,757
notice that you can see a difference in the icons.

89
00:04:13,757 --> 00:04:17,629
You can see these I think they're blue icons that

90
00:04:17,629 --> 00:04:20,900
should represent settings options, and sure enough they do.

91
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:24,379
It looks like this one brings us into power and sleep options.

92
00:04:24,379 --> 00:04:28,878
You notice that each category has subcategories and the current one you're

93
00:04:28,878 --> 00:04:32,117
on is highlighted and then you can use the controls here.

94
00:04:32,117 --> 00:04:33,657
Now let me test your knowledge.

95
00:04:33,657 --> 00:04:37,478
If I make changes here and say that I want the screen to

96
00:04:37,478 --> 00:04:40,503
turn off or sleep after say 45 minutes,

97
00:04:40,503 --> 00:04:42,962
where is that change actually being stored.

98
00:04:42,962 --> 00:04:43,726
Do you remember?

99
00:04:43,726 --> 00:04:46,695
I hope that you're saying the Registry because that answer is correct.

100
00:04:46,695 --> 00:04:50,718
Let me come back and get to where I was where I typed power and you

101
00:04:50,718 --> 00:04:55,271
notice that Edit power plan and Choose a power plan have what to my

102
00:04:55,271 --> 00:04:58,068
mind looks like an old-fashioned icon, and sure enough,

103
00:04:58,068 --> 00:05:01,330
it does in fact take us to the old Control Panel.

104
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:04,739
Again, this dialog has been a part of Windows for a long time.

105
00:05:04,739 --> 00:05:07,807
Notice that you can use the breadcrumb navigation to come

106
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:11,490
back to the home page of Control Panel, and if you been here,

107
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:12,878
done that, bought the T-shirt,

108
00:05:12,878 --> 00:05:16,824
you know that you can display them by category or you can display

109
00:05:16,824 --> 00:05:19,919
them by individual icons either large or small.

110
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,854
I have the latest and greatest updates applied to

111
00:05:22,854 --> 00:05:24,599
this Windows 10 virtual machine,

112
00:05:24,599 --> 00:05:28,815
so it looks like we have settings instead of Control Panel.

113
00:05:28,815 --> 00:05:31,230
It used to be not too long ago actually,

114
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:33,902
that I could right-click the Start button to get to

115
00:05:33,902 --> 00:05:37,233
the old-fashioned Control Panel, but it looks like that's been changed.

116
00:05:37,233 --> 00:05:42,037
This speaks to the fact that the Windows client product groups are

117
00:05:42,037 --> 00:05:47,064
really intent upon changing things kind of rapidly over time as opposed

118
00:05:47,064 --> 00:05:49,773
to waiting 2-3 years to see major changes,

119
00:05:49,773 --> 00:05:52,985
you can expect twice a year at the least to see some of

120
00:05:52,985 --> 00:06:01,000
these changes and they can be frustrated, frustrating I should say, but overall, I think they're a pretty good thing.
