00:00:02.068 --> 00:00:04.616
One way to control app startup is through Task Manager,

2
00:00:04.616 --> 00:00:07.726
Task Manager is a really useful tool.

3
00:00:07.726 --> 00:00:10.801
You can use the Ctrl+Shift+Esc key combination; that's

4
00:00:10.801 --> 00:00:13.077
been around for a long time in Windows.

5
00:00:13.077 --> 00:00:17.066
You can right-click the taskbar and choose Open Task Manager.

6
00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:20.585
From a command prompt you can type taskmgr.

7
00:00:20.585 --> 00:00:21.025
exe.

8
00:00:21.025 --> 00:00:23.151
This is where you go to look at running programs,

9
00:00:23.151 --> 00:00:25.290
but you see all those tabs across the top?

10
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:26.835
You can do so much more.

11
00:00:26.835 --> 00:00:30.839
Microsoft keeps adding more and more functionality to Task Manager,

12
00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:33.800
and in Windows 10 we have a Startup tab that lists not

13
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.171
only your auto-start applications, but also their impact on performance.

14
00:00:38.171 --> 00:00:43.021
You want to keep auto-start programs to only ones you need and use

15
00:00:43.021 --> 00:00:45.744
because they can and will sap your system performance.

16
00:00:45.744 --> 00:00:47.998
They're running all the time in the background,

17
00:00:47.998 --> 00:00:51.079
and if it's a vulnerable application or a questionable

18
00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:54.733
application in terms of reputation you could have an

19
00:00:54.733 --> 00:00:59.408
expanded attack surface on your system, even though that's not what you want.

20
00:00:59.408 --> 00:01:02.912
Now I think that any PC technician needs to have the Sys

21
00:01:02.912 --> 00:01:05.228
Internal Tools in his or her tool belt.

22
00:01:05.228 --> 00:01:06.963
This is a screenshot of AutoRuns.

23
00:01:06.963 --> 00:01:09.604
If you're not familiar with it get familiar with it.

24
00:01:09.604 --> 00:01:12.228
I'm going to do a brief demo on it momentarily.

25
00:01:12.228 --> 00:01:14.015
This leaves nothing to the imagination.

26
00:01:14.015 --> 00:01:17.549
If there's a process or an application or a service that's set

27
00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.879
to auto-start you're going to see it here.

28
00:01:19.879 --> 00:01:22.820
You can disable these entries, you can delete the entries,

29
00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.174
you can investigate them.

30
00:01:24.174 --> 00:01:28.323
This is critical because a malware infected system almost always is

31
00:01:28.323 --> 00:01:31.711
going to put hooks in your systems auto-start.

32
00:01:31.711 --> 00:01:34.633
Quick trivia question based on our previous modules,

33
00:01:34.633 --> 00:01:40.062
where is app auto-start information stored fundamentally on a Windows system?

34
00:01:40.062 --> 00:01:41.308
What do you think?

35
00:01:41.308 --> 00:01:43.178
The answer is the registry, remember,

36
00:01:43.178 --> 00:01:47.909
and this tool will actually point to where in the registry that data is stored.

37
00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.117
as a matter of fact, it's very small on the screen,

38
00:01:50.117 --> 00:01:54.604
but the very first AutoRun entry is an HK local machine system path.

39
00:01:54.604 --> 00:01:59.131
Now I want to warn you, though, don't be too aggressive in deleting auto-starts.

40
00:01:59.131 --> 00:02:01.141
Have an idea of why it's there.

41
00:02:01.141 --> 00:02:04.212
For instance, it might be too small on your screen to see,

42
00:02:04.212 --> 00:02:07.103
but the very first entry I have on this screenshot is cmd.

43
00:02:07.103 --> 00:02:09.061
exe, and you might think, whoa,

44
00:02:09.061 --> 00:02:12.055
what's a command prompt running on my system at auto-start.

45
00:02:12.055 --> 00:02:13.495
I'm going to delete that.

46
00:02:13.495 --> 00:02:14.161
Be careful.

47
00:02:14.161 --> 00:02:17.292
I generated this screenshot while I was troubleshooting a system,

48
00:02:17.292 --> 00:02:19.639
and if you look, again, it might be too small,

49
00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:22.445
but that HK local machine system registry path goes

50
00:02:22.445 --> 00:02:28.136
out to SafeBoot\AlternateShell, so I'm actually booting in a diagnostic mode.

51
00:02:28.136 --> 00:02:30.158
I don't want to mess up that command shell.

52
00:02:30.158 --> 00:02:31.491
That's internal to Windows.

53
00:02:31.491 --> 00:02:34.435
I'm going to use my normal operating system controls

54
00:02:34.435 --> 00:02:35.660
when I'm finished troubleshooting,

55
00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:43.000
and the next time I do a normal startup that entry is going to disappear from the list automatically.
