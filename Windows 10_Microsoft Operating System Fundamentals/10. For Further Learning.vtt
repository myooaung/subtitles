00:00:01.679 --> 00:00:04.145
For further learning in the Pluralsight library I would

2
00:00:04.145 --> 00:00:06.481
recommend you hit Mike Halsey's course,

3
00:00:06.481 --> 00:00:08.716
Windows Virus and Malware Troubleshooting.

4
00:00:08.716 --> 00:00:13.216
Mike is a really skilled trainer and a seasoned IT pro,

5
00:00:13.216 --> 00:00:16.164
so that's going to be some excellent real-world guidance.

6
00:00:16.164 --> 00:00:19.999
MVP, by the way, stands for Most Valuable Professional.

7
00:00:19.999 --> 00:00:24.027
It's a Microsoft award program that Microsoft gives out to community

8
00:00:24.027 --> 00:00:27.120
members that they feel make a substantial impact.

9
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:31.102
Also, there's Glenn Weadock's Windows Server 2016 Security Hardening,

10
00:00:31.102 --> 00:00:33.570
and I submit that it's good for you as you're working and

11
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.962
building your Windows 10 expertise to constantly compare and

12
00:00:36.962 --> 00:00:38.832
contrast with the server experience,

13
00:00:38.832 --> 00:00:41.871
especially if you're going into IT and you have

14
00:00:41.871 --> 00:00:49.000
aspirations for systems administration, you need to know client and server sides equally well.
