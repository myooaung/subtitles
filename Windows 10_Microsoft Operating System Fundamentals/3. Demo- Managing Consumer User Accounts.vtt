00:00:02.178 --> 00:00:05.405
Okay, let's work with user accounts in Windows 10.

2
00:00:05.405 --> 00:00:08.131
This is a Windows 10 Enterprise edition desktop,

3
00:00:08.131 --> 00:00:10.628
so it's obviously a business class OS.

4
00:00:10.628 --> 00:00:12.140
That having been said,

5
00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:17.377
this'll be quite obvious to you in just a moment that the general GUI in

6
00:00:17.377 --> 00:00:19.656
the Settings application is very consumer friendly.

7
00:00:19.656 --> 00:00:22.603
So I'll open up Cortana and type user accounts,

8
00:00:22.603 --> 00:00:27.349
and we get Add, edit, or remove other people in System Settings.

9
00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:31.465
Now this particular Family and other people category under

10
00:00:31.465 --> 00:00:33.978
Settings has the options that we need,

11
00:00:33.978 --> 00:00:38.062
not only to add additional user accounts to a Windows 10 box,

12
00:00:38.062 --> 00:00:40.758
but also to modify your own account properties,

13
00:00:40.758 --> 00:00:42.781
but it brought us here to Family and other people,

14
00:00:42.781 --> 00:00:46.639
and this is what I meant that it's very consumer friendly language.

15
00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:48.838
Add a family member, for instance,

16
00:00:48.838 --> 00:00:51.371
and it's defaulting there to Microsoft account,

17
00:00:51.371 --> 00:00:52.772
which as I said,

18
00:00:52.772 --> 00:00:57.395
is one of those potential points of confusion for many Windows 10 customers,

19
00:00:57.395 --> 00:01:00.929
and in a business context may not be what you want at all.

20
00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:02.229
I'm going to close that out.

21
00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:04.823
My internet connection has been kind of spotty here.

22
00:01:04.823 --> 00:01:07.919
I want to focus on the currently logged on user,

23
00:01:07.919 --> 00:01:12.238
and just the differences between the local account and the Microsoft account.

24
00:01:12.238 --> 00:01:15.021
You remember earlier in the course when we did a

25
00:01:15.021 --> 00:01:16.565
fresh installation of Windows 10,

26
00:01:16.565 --> 00:01:20.463
one of the preliminary questions that Windows asks is if you

27
00:01:20.463 --> 00:01:23.270
want a local account or a Microsoft account.

28
00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.266
I much prefer to go with a local account that's not in

29
00:01:27.266 --> 00:01:30.628
any way reliant upon the internet, and then as you see here,

30
00:01:30.628 --> 00:01:33.329
again, I'm under Settings, Your info.

31
00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.301
You can attach your Microsoft account to your local

32
00:01:37.301 --> 00:01:39.411
account after the fact this way.

33
00:01:39.411 --> 00:01:42.967
Notice that you can also create your picture by browsing to an

34
00:01:42.967 --> 00:01:45.888
image file or using your webcam to snap a pic,

35
00:01:45.888 --> 00:01:49.093
but if we click Sign in with a Microsoft account again,

36
00:01:49.093 --> 00:01:50.257
it's spinning around here,

37
00:01:50.257 --> 00:01:53.579
but it's going to eventually ask for Microsoft account credentials,

38
00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.304
and if you're wondering how to create a Microsoft account,

39
00:01:57.304 --> 00:01:58.450
they're absolutely free,

40
00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.720
I've included some documentation in the exercise

41
00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.997
files for you to take a look at.

42
00:02:02.997 --> 00:02:06.424
Now as far as other related accounts, like SaaS accounts,

43
00:02:06.424 --> 00:02:07.893
Software as a Service accounts,

44
00:02:07.893 --> 00:02:11.238
that's what Email and app accounts allows you to do.

45
00:02:11.238 --> 00:02:12.425
So, for instance,

46
00:02:12.425 --> 00:02:16.992
I have a Comcast email Id that's connected to my Outlook email client,

47
00:02:16.992 --> 00:02:22.479
and if I go to Add an account it has built-in support for G docs,

48
00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:26.409
Google docs, Yahoo, Apple iCloud, or just generic email accounts.

49
00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:30.426
So this is where you can stage mail accounts for view within,

50
00:02:30.426 --> 00:02:33.611
well, if you have Office Suite you have Outlook,

51
00:02:33.611 --> 00:02:37.112
otherwise, you could use the built-in Windows 10 mail app.

52
00:02:37.112 --> 00:02:39.004
Sign-in options just gives you,

53
00:02:39.004 --> 00:02:42.382
depending upon the edition of Windows that you have,

54
00:02:42.382 --> 00:02:47.578
whether you can require a sign-in after the machine goes to a screen saver,

55
00:02:47.578 --> 00:02:50.580
whether you want to use Windows Hello biometrics.

56
00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.129
You can change your password.

57
00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:55.228
There is other ways to do authentication with local accounts.

58
00:02:55.228 --> 00:02:58.440
You can do a PIN, that's a Personal Identification Number.

59
00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.876
You can do a picture password, which is kind of fun.

60
00:03:01.876 --> 00:03:02.172
Again,

61
00:03:02.172 --> 00:03:05.792
I'd encourage you to play with those options and check the exercise

62
00:03:05.792 --> 00:03:08.810
files because I have some help for you there.

63
00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.531
Access work and school is where you can attach an

64
00:03:12.531 --> 00:03:13.937
Azure Active Directory account.

65
00:03:13.937 --> 00:03:16.655
So if we click Connect here, once again,

66
00:03:16.655 --> 00:03:18.784
it's spinning back to that Microsoft account.

67
00:03:18.784 --> 00:03:21.278
It's trying to get back to that logon screen.

68
00:03:21.278 --> 00:03:26.334
Work or school accounts is a friendly way to refer to an Azure AD account.

69
00:03:26.334 --> 00:03:31.786
So if your business is using Office 365 one way that you might want to attach

70
00:03:31.786 --> 00:03:36.387
to that Office 365 credential is to attach it right here.

71
00:03:36.387 --> 00:03:38.808
So that's a quick tour of the Settings app.

72
00:03:38.808 --> 00:03:42.584
I'm not a really big fan of it because it's not very direct,

73
00:03:42.584 --> 00:03:46.136
and it's a little difficult to find, to be perfectly honest with you.

74
00:03:46.136 --> 00:03:49.299
Now if you're running a business SKU of Windows 10 you can

75
00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:56.000
manage your local accounts much more cleanly through the computer management console.
