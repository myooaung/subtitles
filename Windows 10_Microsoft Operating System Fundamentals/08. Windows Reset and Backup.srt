1
00:00:00,353 --> 00:00:03,765
Windows Backup.

2
00:00:03,765 --> 00:00:04,101
Now,

3
00:00:04,101 --> 00:00:08,129
we have quit a bit to untangle here with the notion of

4
00:00:08,129 --> 00:00:10,276
an honest to goodness backup program.

5
00:00:10,276 --> 00:00:13,265
If you've used traditional backup solutions in Windows,

6
00:00:13,265 --> 00:00:16,985
you know that you can backup files and folders and

7
00:00:16,985 --> 00:00:18,698
set that backup on a schedule.

8
00:00:18,698 --> 00:00:21,816
You can back up to another hard drive, a network location,

9
00:00:21,816 --> 00:00:24,599
the cloud, whatever it is that you want to do,

10
00:00:24,599 --> 00:00:26,027
and that capability exists.

11
00:00:26,027 --> 00:00:29,167
You can also create a system image backup which

12
00:00:29,167 --> 00:00:32,009
backs up your entire disk volume, like your C drive,

13
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:33,113
your entire environment,

14
00:00:33,113 --> 00:00:37,697
such that you can restore that system image to put your entire system

15
00:00:37,697 --> 00:00:40,978
truly back in time to when you created that image.

16
00:00:40,978 --> 00:00:44,806
I used to do that as a general practice on my home computers.

17
00:00:44,806 --> 00:00:48,007
I would install all my applications, get everything up to date,

18
00:00:48,007 --> 00:00:51,202
and then snapshot a golden image that I could roll back to

19
00:00:51,202 --> 00:00:53,376
if something went wrong in the future.

20
00:00:53,376 --> 00:00:58,527
This shows the Settings dialog, and it shows the reset option, Reset this PC.

21
00:00:58,527 --> 00:01:00,793
If you're going to sell your Windows 10 device,

22
00:01:00,793 --> 00:01:04,667
you'll want to make sure that your system is reset to a pristine

23
00:01:04,667 --> 00:01:07,508
environment with all of your personal data being gone.

24
00:01:07,508 --> 00:01:10,886
You certainly never want to hand off a computer to somebody

25
00:01:10,886 --> 00:01:13,547
that still has remnants of your work on it.

26
00:01:13,547 --> 00:01:16,671
The Reset functionality actually does two things.

27
00:01:16,671 --> 00:01:19,418
In previous versions, like Windows 8 and 8.

28
00:01:19,418 --> 00:01:21,478
1, you could reset or refresh.

29
00:01:21,478 --> 00:01:23,309
Now it's all under one heading here.

30
00:01:23,309 --> 00:01:27,909
You have a choice when you go down the reset path to either keep your files,

31
00:01:27,909 --> 00:01:30,696
which is essentially you're just reinstalling the operating system,

32
00:01:30,696 --> 00:01:35,303
or you're doing a true reset where you're deleting all of your personal data.

33
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:37,293
As far as the Backup and Restore program,

34
00:01:37,293 --> 00:01:39,627
like I said, this is a screenshot from it,

35
00:01:39,627 --> 00:01:41,873
we'll walk through the process in a demo.

36
00:01:41,873 --> 00:01:45,918
The product is actually called Windows 7 Backup and Restore.

37
00:01:45,918 --> 00:01:48,963
This speaks to the fact that as of Windows 8, 8.

38
00:01:48,963 --> 00:01:49,794
1, and 10,

39
00:01:49,794 --> 00:01:52,454
Microsoft is really looking at File History as the

40
00:01:52,454 --> 00:01:54,546
way to backup files and folders,

41
00:01:54,546 --> 00:01:58,667
but you can still use Windows Backup proper as you see

42
00:01:58,667 --> 00:02:00,479
here to backup entire disk volumes,

43
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:04,788
you can do a system image backup of your C drive,

44
00:02:04,788 --> 00:02:07,916
you can backup individual files, individual volumes.

45
00:02:07,916 --> 00:02:15,000
It's a pretty flexible tool. And it comes with the operating system, there's no additional cost.
