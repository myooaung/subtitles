1
00:00:01,694 --> 00:00:05,700
In this demonstration, we'll work with file systems,

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,435
and specifically I'm going to walk through how to initialize a new disk,

3
00:00:09,435 --> 00:00:12,692
create partitions, format them, so forth.

4
00:00:12,692 --> 00:00:15,365
We do this through the Disk Management Console.

5
00:00:15,365 --> 00:00:17,319
Couple different ways to do that.

6
00:00:17,319 --> 00:00:20,251
We can just do a search for disk management.

7
00:00:20,251 --> 00:00:25,798
That brings us to Control panel, Create and format hard disk partitions.

8
00:00:25,798 --> 00:00:26,446
Huh, weird.

9
00:00:26,446 --> 00:00:28,715
Yeah, it's one way to do it.

10
00:00:28,715 --> 00:00:30,425
Another way, my favorite way,

11
00:00:30,425 --> 00:00:36,212
is to get to a run prompt or a command prompt and type diskmgmt.

12
00:00:36,212 --> 00:00:36,625
msc.

13
00:00:36,625 --> 00:00:39,671
That's the specific file name for the Disk

14
00:00:39,671 --> 00:00:41,194
Management Microsoft Management Console.

15
00:00:41,194 --> 00:00:43,699
I have it open here, so I'll close out of the Run box.

16
00:00:43,699 --> 00:00:47,510
Now, because I mounted a new, uninitialized disk,

17
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:50,990
we're prompted right off the top, do you want to initialize it?

18
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:52,838
I'm actually going to cross out of that,

19
00:00:52,838 --> 00:00:56,669
or X out of that, and we'll maximize our Disk Management interface.

20
00:00:56,669 --> 00:00:59,114
Up on the top, we have a list of volumes.

21
00:00:59,114 --> 00:01:01,227
Remember, a volume is a formatted partition,

22
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:05,249
and a volume does not necessarily mean that you're

23
00:01:05,249 --> 00:01:08,493
occupying all space on a physical device.

24
00:01:08,493 --> 00:01:13,480
This machine has one, two, three fixed disks,

25
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,926
internal disks, and one optical drive,

26
00:01:15,926 --> 00:01:18,924
on which it looks like I have a DVD mounted.

27
00:01:18,924 --> 00:01:20,317
Its volume label is right there.

28
00:01:20,317 --> 00:01:22,888
I happen to know that's the Windows 10 Professional DVD.

29
00:01:22,888 --> 00:01:25,725
We can see up on top in the summary,

30
00:01:25,725 --> 00:01:28,730
we see what kind of file systems we're using.

31
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:33,250
It looks NTFS, except for the DVD that uses the UDF file system.

32
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:35,722
The status, let me stretch this out.

33
00:01:35,722 --> 00:01:36,066
Actually,

34
00:01:36,066 --> 00:01:39,511
I'll double left-click the right side of each of these

35
00:01:39,511 --> 00:01:41,230
column headers to autosize them.

36
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:43,259
They're all healthy, and that's good,

37
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:47,286
but you see on my Disk 0 I have my System Reserved partition.

38
00:01:47,286 --> 00:01:48,358
That's 500 MB.

39
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:50,860
Windows creates that for its own use.

40
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:55,412
My boot volume is my drive C, NTFS, as you can see.

41
00:01:55,412 --> 00:01:59,408
And then I have a Recovery Partition for my recovery environment that also,

42
00:01:59,408 --> 00:02:02,891
neither it nor the System Reserved have a drive letter

43
00:02:02,891 --> 00:02:05,192
because we don't need to interact with them.

44
00:02:05,192 --> 00:02:07,423
I have a D drive that's called DATA.

45
00:02:07,423 --> 00:02:08,419
That's using NTFS.

46
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:12,019
I have a new uninitialized disk that I've told you about

47
00:02:12,019 --> 00:02:14,527
that we saw the pop-up for a moment ago.

48
00:02:14,527 --> 00:02:16,197
And then we have our DVD.

49
00:02:16,197 --> 00:02:19,611
If we open up File Explorer, and we navigate to This PC,

50
00:02:19,611 --> 00:02:21,938
there's our C drive, there's our D drive,

51
00:02:21,938 --> 00:02:23,654
and there's our optical disk.

52
00:02:23,654 --> 00:02:25,371
To initialize a new disk,

53
00:02:25,371 --> 00:02:30,345
we'll right-click its header and choose Initialize Disk from the shortcut menu.

54
00:02:30,345 --> 00:02:35,003
Normally, for most purposes, MBR or Master Boot Record is fine.

55
00:02:35,003 --> 00:02:38,971
GPT is a newer partition management format.

56
00:02:38,971 --> 00:02:40,858
I'm going to leave MBR here.

57
00:02:40,858 --> 00:02:45,362
And once the disk is marked Online, we can start to carve it up.

58
00:02:45,362 --> 00:02:48,321
Now this is a 60 GB unallocated space block.

59
00:02:48,321 --> 00:02:52,231
If I right-click and choose New Simple Volume, it kicks off the wizard.

60
00:02:52,231 --> 00:02:54,275
We can step through this.

61
00:02:54,275 --> 00:02:58,773
I'm going to create a 20 GB by specifying 20000 MB.

62
00:02:58,773 --> 00:03:03,471
Next, assign the following letter, it picks up the next available one by default,

63
00:03:03,471 --> 00:03:06,913
that's fine, and then here's where we format that volume.

64
00:03:06,913 --> 00:03:11,727
In this case, it's giving us the choice of only FAT32 or NTFS,

65
00:03:11,727 --> 00:03:15,402
not ReFs, which we would see in Windows Server systems.

66
00:03:15,402 --> 00:03:19,794
The Allocation unit size, default is normally fine to let Windows choose.

67
00:03:19,794 --> 00:03:23,601
This is the size of the clusters that'll be used on that system.

68
00:03:23,601 --> 00:03:24,591
Normally it's 4K.

69
00:03:24,591 --> 00:03:28,223
And then for Volume label, we can always change that later.

70
00:03:28,223 --> 00:03:34,389
I'll call it DATA2, just for now, and we can enable compression right here,

71
00:03:34,389 --> 00:03:36,081
or we can do it later.

72
00:03:36,081 --> 00:03:38,900
That again is a feature of the NTFS file system.

73
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,557
Didn't take long at all for that to work,

74
00:03:40,557 --> 00:03:42,168
and if I click the notification balloon,

75
00:03:42,168 --> 00:03:47,793
I can open the folder and I can start to store data on this drive all day long.

76
00:03:47,793 --> 00:03:51,461
Now you can do things in here that are kind of cool.

77
00:03:51,461 --> 00:03:53,824
You can extend volume, shrink volumes.

78
00:03:53,824 --> 00:03:55,475
Of course, you can delete it.

79
00:03:55,475 --> 00:03:57,127
You can change the drive letter.

80
00:03:57,127 --> 00:03:58,864
If we're not happy with F,

81
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:01,956
we can change it to another available one in the alphabet.

82
00:04:01,956 --> 00:04:04,800
I have to do that from time to time on systems.

83
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,340
But basically,

84
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:08,038
the distinction between the top and the bottom is the

85
00:04:08,038 --> 00:04:10,967
top is a summary view and down here,

86
00:04:10,967 --> 00:04:14,806
the graphical map allows you to work directly on each volume.

87
00:04:14,806 --> 00:04:18,291
And then as far as making changes go in the future,

88
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:21,816
if we needed this to use a different file system for whatever reason,

89
00:04:21,816 --> 00:04:23,979
we could right-click and go to Format,

90
00:04:23,979 --> 00:04:27,649
and you have an opportunity to choose another file system.

91
00:04:27,649 --> 00:04:28,319
There's REFS.

92
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:31,671
We can change the volume label if we want to.

93
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:35,284
I'll call it REFSVOL and perform a quick format.

94
00:04:35,284 --> 00:04:37,729
Of course, if I had any data on this disk,

95
00:04:37,729 --> 00:04:38,952
it's going to be gone,

96
00:04:38,952 --> 00:04:43,383
so you want to be extraordinarily careful when you're performing a format.

97
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:45,136
And that is an administrative action.

98
00:04:45,136 --> 00:04:51,000
I'm logged onto the system as a member of the local administrators group, as you would expect.
