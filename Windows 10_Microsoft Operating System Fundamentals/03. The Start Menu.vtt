00:00:02.293 --> 00:00:05.983
We'll start with the Start menu.

2
00:00:05.983 --> 00:00:11.091
The historical perspective here is Windows 8 released in August 2012.

3
00:00:11.091 --> 00:00:16.303
If you have previous experience with earlier Windows versions say Windows 95,

4
00:00:16.303 --> 00:00:21.057
Windows 98, Windows NT, those operating systems,

5
00:00:21.057 --> 00:00:24.907
you're used to the Start menu and what Microsoft did with Windows

6
00:00:24.907 --> 00:00:28.437
8 was a dramatic departure where they replaced the Start menu

7
00:00:28.437 --> 00:00:30.455
with what's called the Start screen.

8
00:00:30.455 --> 00:00:36.170
This was quite a failure, and so that's why Windows 8 quickly became Windows 8.

9
00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.996
1 where Microsoft started to walk back on the idea of losing the Start menu.

10
00:00:40.996 --> 00:00:42.232
Nowadays in Windows 10,

11
00:00:42.232 --> 00:00:45.559
we finally have the Start menu back much to everyone's joy,

12
00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:49.071
but what they've done, and by they, I mean the Windows development teams,

13
00:00:49.071 --> 00:00:52.735
is that they've given us a hybrid of some of the best of both worlds.

14
00:00:52.735 --> 00:00:53.645
What do I mean?

15
00:00:53.645 --> 00:00:56.555
Well first of all, if you click the Microsoft flag icon,

16
00:00:56.555 --> 00:01:00.353
that is your equivalent of your Start button as it's existed since

17
00:01:00.353 --> 00:01:03.265
Windows 95 and you'll notice that next door to it,

18
00:01:03.265 --> 00:01:04.788
there is ask me anything.

19
00:01:04.788 --> 00:01:07.980
This refers to the ability to just type to search for

20
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:09.492
the results that you're looking for.

21
00:01:09.492 --> 00:01:13.574
Honestly, I very rarely go through the Start menu to click icons.

22
00:01:13.574 --> 00:01:16.400
I'll tend to just hit the Start key on my keyboard

23
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.974
which will open the Start menu,

24
00:01:17.974 --> 00:01:21.250
type what I'm looking for and press Enter or maybe use the

25
00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.729
arrow keys to find the specific program.

26
00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.684
Cortana is a feature that we'll look at shortly.

27
00:01:26.684 --> 00:01:30.143
This allows you even to add voice commands to your Windows navigation.

28
00:01:30.143 --> 00:01:34.196
Now you'll notice that we have at the bottom of the Windows 10 Start menu

29
00:01:34.196 --> 00:01:37.161
some fixed items that allow you to adjust your settings,

30
00:01:37.161 --> 00:01:40.596
that's your preferences, File Explorer to browse your files,

31
00:01:40.596 --> 00:01:43.934
Power to sleep the computer, restart it,

32
00:01:43.934 --> 00:01:44.888
or shutdown.

33
00:01:44.888 --> 00:01:47.948
And then of course, we have an arrangement of program icons.

34
00:01:47.948 --> 00:01:50.021
You'll notice that there is some intelligence built

35
00:01:50.021 --> 00:01:52.329
into the Windows 10 Start menu, by default,

36
00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:55.192
your most used programs show up on the top.

37
00:01:55.192 --> 00:01:59.974
You can always click your customizable avatar to get to your account settings,

38
00:01:59.974 --> 00:02:01.625
and then drumroll please,

39
00:02:01.625 --> 00:02:05.816
we have this customizable Start screen area over on the right.

40
00:02:05.816 --> 00:02:09.979
Now it is possible to configure Windows 10 to use the Windows 8

41
00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.274
Start screen if you actually are one of those three or four people

42
00:02:13.274 --> 00:02:15.163
on the face of the earth who liked it.

43
00:02:15.163 --> 00:02:18.647
Check the exercise files because I give you a tutorial link there.

44
00:02:18.647 --> 00:02:24.019
But I've come to like this idea, this notion of what are called live tiles.

45
00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:26.856
Instead of a static icon of a program,

46
00:02:26.856 --> 00:02:29.273
you actually have the tile perform dynamically.

47
00:02:29.273 --> 00:02:33.089
So I'm pointing to a sports app and notice that it's

48
00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:35.553
actually giving me live sports headlines.

49
00:02:35.553 --> 00:02:38.539
Similarly, if I have a news app or a weather app,

50
00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:41.418
those live tiles will actually display useful information.

51
00:02:41.418 --> 00:02:45.862
In addition, of course, you can click the tile to enter the program itself,

52
00:02:45.862 --> 00:02:50.509
but one of the beauties of live tiles is that they will give you feedback

53
00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:53.910
that's useful without even necessarily opening the application.

54
00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.792
Just by way of history,

55
00:02:55.792 --> 00:03:00.187
the idea behind the Windows 8 Start screen and that notion of live

56
00:03:00.187 --> 00:03:03.886
tiles was part of Microsoft's push to create a single unified

57
00:03:03.886 --> 00:03:07.515
Windows experience across all devices, laptop,

58
00:03:07.515 --> 00:03:08.477
desktop, phone,

59
00:03:08.477 --> 00:03:13.114
there is a Windows phone 10 that's basically a dead operating system now,

60
00:03:13.114 --> 00:03:14.880
but it was an attempt.

61
00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.914
There is the tablet version originally Windows 8.

62
00:03:17.914 --> 00:03:22.153
1 for tablets was called Windows RT, that eventually got scrapped.

63
00:03:22.153 --> 00:03:25.605
We still have this move toward a unified Windows interface.

64
00:03:25.605 --> 00:03:30.392
For instance, if you use the XBOX 1 or the XBOX 1X,

65
00:03:30.392 --> 00:03:39.000
you'll find that the tile system there behaves quite similarly to how Windows 10 does for us here on the desktop.
