00:00:01.876 --> 00:00:06.425
Windows 10 Installation Prerequisites.

2
00:00:06.425 --> 00:00:09.818
Your first task in installing Windows 10 is choosing which

3
00:00:09.818 --> 00:00:12.362
edition is relevant for your use case.

4
00:00:12.362 --> 00:00:16.308
Historically, Windows has been a bit, how can I describe this,

5
00:00:16.308 --> 00:00:19.038
complex, in terms of all the various editions.

6
00:00:19.038 --> 00:00:24.341
My mind goes back to Windows 7, for instance, that had so many editions.

7
00:00:24.341 --> 00:00:26.794
The Windows Client development team have done some

8
00:00:26.794 --> 00:00:29.017
good work in trying to streamline it.

9
00:00:29.017 --> 00:00:33.205
Basically, we've got Windows 10 Home edition that's targeted at the consumer,

10
00:00:33.205 --> 00:00:38.362
this is not a business user, the consumer who uses laptop computers,

11
00:00:38.362 --> 00:00:40.509
desktop computers, so-called two-in-one devices,

12
00:00:40.509 --> 00:00:44.480
which would be like a Surface Pro tablet let's say.

13
00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.965
There is also heavy integration between Windows 10 Home and multimedia apps,

14
00:00:48.965 --> 00:00:49.588
for instance,

15
00:00:49.588 --> 00:00:53.209
the ability to integrate seamlessly with the XBOX 1 or

16
00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:56.087
XBOX 1x consoles for streaming media.

17
00:00:56.087 --> 00:00:59.647
On the business side of the equation, there is Windows 10 Pro,

18
00:00:59.647 --> 00:01:00.897
short for Professional.

19
00:01:00.897 --> 00:01:04.271
This includes business features like BitLocker drive encryption,

20
00:01:04.271 --> 00:01:07.282
Windows Update for Business, and Domain join.

21
00:01:07.282 --> 00:01:10.966
The bottom line is although the code base is essentially the same,

22
00:01:10.966 --> 00:01:14.711
these features are unlocked or locked depending upon your edition.

23
00:01:14.711 --> 00:01:17.621
We're going to cover upgrade scenarios in a future module,

24
00:01:17.621 --> 00:01:21.823
so here we're dealing only with a new initial installation of Windows.

25
00:01:21.823 --> 00:01:25.993
Windows 10 Home is not going to have any of the business specific features.

26
00:01:25.993 --> 00:01:26.558
Remote Desktop,

27
00:01:26.558 --> 00:01:29.665
a lot of those cool things that we've examined in the

28
00:01:29.665 --> 00:01:32.298
past are business only scenarios, and of course,

29
00:01:32.298 --> 00:01:35.609
you can expect to see a price difference between the

30
00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:37.939
home and pro versions for that reason.

31
00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:40.464
Client Hyper-V, I guess, would be another example.

32
00:01:40.464 --> 00:01:42.463
If you don't know what Windows Update for Business is,

33
00:01:42.463 --> 00:01:46.318
this is a way to centralize the process of updating multiple

34
00:01:46.318 --> 00:01:50.231
Windows computers and domain join refers to the Windows Client

35
00:01:50.231 --> 00:01:54.672
computer's ability to interact with an Active Directory domain

36
00:01:54.672 --> 00:01:56.889
managed by Windows Server.

37
00:01:56.889 --> 00:02:00.705
Now there is some more business or organizational editions

38
00:02:00.705 --> 00:02:02.692
available in the Windows 10 portfolio.

39
00:02:02.692 --> 00:02:03.317
In business,

40
00:02:03.317 --> 00:02:07.089
it's commonly going to be a question of do you need the

41
00:02:07.089 --> 00:02:08.985
pro edition or the enterprise edition.

42
00:02:08.985 --> 00:02:12.815
The enterprise edition has its own side of complexities.

43
00:02:12.815 --> 00:02:16.260
There are two versions, they're called stock keeping units or SKUs,

44
00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.717
E3 and E5, each has their own set of features,

45
00:02:19.717 --> 00:02:24.180
E5 has all of the E3 features plus some additional ones like

46
00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.312
Windows Defender advanced threat protection,

47
00:02:26.312 --> 00:02:28.188
Device Guard, Credential Guard.

48
00:02:28.188 --> 00:02:31.217
The specifics of what those features are beyond our scope,

49
00:02:31.217 --> 00:02:33.011
suffice it to say,

50
00:02:33.011 --> 00:02:37.649
these are very advanced threat intelligence and security tools that are

51
00:02:37.649 --> 00:02:41.632
used for businesses that have really high stakes intellectual property

52
00:02:41.632 --> 00:02:47.016
where you want to control these desktop computers strictly to avoid stuff

53
00:02:47.016 --> 00:02:49.664
like data leakage and malware infection.

54
00:02:49.664 --> 00:02:52.998
Of course, everybody wants those goals, but in a business,

55
00:02:52.998 --> 00:02:54.034
it becomes more important.

56
00:02:54.034 --> 00:02:55.328
I think you would agree.

57
00:02:55.328 --> 00:02:58.292
Now the reason why I put SaaS in parentheses,

58
00:02:58.292 --> 00:03:00.863
that stands for Software as a Service,

59
00:03:00.863 --> 00:03:03.788
is that enterprise edition historically isn't bought,

60
00:03:03.788 --> 00:03:05.629
in fact, you can't buy it in a store,

61
00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:08.785
you have to work through a Microsoft reseller or you have to

62
00:03:08.785 --> 00:03:11.036
work with Microsoft themselves to buy this.

63
00:03:11.036 --> 00:03:15.510
And it's sold by a subscription basis or a volume license key basis.

64
00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.925
You're probably accustomed to purchasing single use software or

65
00:03:18.925 --> 00:03:23.307
single user licensed software where you pay a price for a

66
00:03:23.307 --> 00:03:27.424
single unlock key for a single installation of a single product

67
00:03:27.424 --> 00:03:29.247
on say a single computer.

68
00:03:29.247 --> 00:03:30.259
Well with enterprise,

69
00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:34.207
you have to deploy dozens or hundreds or thousands of operating systems,

70
00:03:34.207 --> 00:03:37.514
you're going to want to look for a more streamlined

71
00:03:37.514 --> 00:03:39.936
way to take care of activation.

72
00:03:39.936 --> 00:03:42.177
All of that is part of the enterprise SKU.

73
00:03:42.177 --> 00:03:43.223
Now like I said,

74
00:03:43.223 --> 00:03:45.839
there is a price difference and there is a licensing

75
00:03:45.839 --> 00:03:47.165
difference between pro and enterprise.

76
00:03:47.165 --> 00:03:49.728
That's something that the business leaders need to determine

77
00:03:49.728 --> 00:03:52.470
in the light of how many users you have,

78
00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.154
how big your organization is,

79
00:03:54.154 --> 00:03:57.988
and what your emphasis is on centralized management and security.

80
00:03:57.988 --> 00:04:02.892
Windows 10 Education is basically Windows 10 Enterprise with a different

81
00:04:02.892 --> 00:04:05.791
licensing and pricing scheme for educational institutions.

82
00:04:05.791 --> 00:04:08.207
You go to a university, for instance,

83
00:04:08.207 --> 00:04:12.384
you may get a deal on Windows 10 and that helps the university because they use,

84
00:04:12.384 --> 00:04:13.503
in this case,

85
00:04:13.503 --> 00:04:16.961
they would be using Active Directory and Centralized Management

86
00:04:16.961 --> 00:04:21.813
tools to deliver updates and help you protect your computer as it

87
00:04:21.813 --> 00:04:23.455
interacts with university resources.

88
00:04:23.455 --> 00:04:27.592
There is Windows 10 Pro Education which is a less expensive way to go

89
00:04:27.592 --> 00:04:30.655
and this feature set is analogous to Windows 10 Pro.

90
00:04:30.655 --> 00:04:34.278
Now there is a couple other highly specialized Windows 10 editions,

91
00:04:34.278 --> 00:04:37.715
one is the so-called Internet of Things or IoT edition.

92
00:04:37.715 --> 00:04:41.925
The IoT versions are super specialized, they're meant for the consumer side,

93
00:04:41.925 --> 00:04:45.147
the maker community if you've ever used the raspberry pie,

94
00:04:45.147 --> 00:04:48.305
the $35-$45 computer, the little tiny little computer,

95
00:04:48.305 --> 00:04:51.870
and also for businesses that do IoT,

96
00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:56.948
IoT refers to network capable devices in business and in home.

97
00:04:56.948 --> 00:05:00.523
It could be a security camera, it could be a refrigerator at your home,

98
00:05:00.523 --> 00:05:04.323
anything that has some computing power in it and the potential to

99
00:05:04.323 --> 00:05:06.463
connect to the internet is technically IoT.

100
00:05:06.463 --> 00:05:06.779
Well,

101
00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:13.000
there is a very small compact version of Windows 10 intended for those environments.
