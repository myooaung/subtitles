00:00:00.044 --> 00:00:04.270
In summary, well I submit to you that networking,

2
00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:07.916
the ability to do Ethernet networking, wired and Wi-Fi,

3
00:00:07.916 --> 00:00:09.684
is an evergreen skill set.

4
00:00:09.684 --> 00:00:12.426
It's one that you'll use throughout your entire career,

5
00:00:12.426 --> 00:00:14.763
regardless of whether you're in academia,

6
00:00:14.763 --> 00:00:16.710
whether you're in corporate business,

7
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.136
whether you're working with mom and pop shops,

8
00:00:19.136 --> 00:00:23.690
networking is ubiquitous, it truly is, because the internet is ubiquitous,

9
00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:27.352
and the need for systems to work together directly in a

10
00:00:27.352 --> 00:00:29.636
private setting is also just as ubiquitous.

11
00:00:29.636 --> 00:00:30.286
So, therefore,

12
00:00:30.286 --> 00:00:33.233
knowing how to configure and troubleshoot Windows 10

13
00:00:33.233 --> 00:00:36.208
networking is an eternally valuable skill for you.

14
00:00:36.208 --> 00:00:40.611
Make sure to invest proper time to understand not only how to go

15
00:00:40.611 --> 00:00:42.862
through the step-by-steps for their own sake,

16
00:00:42.862 --> 00:00:46.237
but what the underlying and background theory is.

17
00:00:46.237 --> 00:00:50.276
Make sure that your understanding of network is broad and deep, okay?

18
00:00:50.276 --> 00:00:54.367
For homework, I would encourage you to do some research on IPv6.

19
00:00:54.367 --> 00:00:57.855
For many reasons, not the least of which that IPv4,

20
00:00:57.855 --> 00:01:01.032
the public address space has been depleted,

21
00:01:01.032 --> 00:01:07.116
IPv6 is slowly becoming the de facto networking protocol for the internet,

22
00:01:07.116 --> 00:01:09.000
and eventually even on-premises.

23
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.061
But there's reasons why it's so slow,

24
00:01:11.061 --> 00:01:13.750
the address format being a big barrier to entry.

25
00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.242
Check the exercise files for a couple introductory links on that,

26
00:01:17.242 --> 00:01:21.953
but you definitely want to get comfortable with IPv6 sooner rather than later.

27
00:01:21.953 --> 00:01:24.093
Alrighty, well, that ends this module.

28
00:01:24.093 --> 00:01:25.519
Thanks for your participation.

29
00:01:25.519 --> 00:01:29.444
And in the next module, we're really winding things up in this course series,

30
00:01:29.444 --> 00:01:35.000
aren't we, we'll look at Windows 10 Backup and Recovery. Happy studying.
