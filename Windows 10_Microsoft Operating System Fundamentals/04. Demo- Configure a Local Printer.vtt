1
00:00:02.324 --> 00:00:04.997
Let's work with local printing and Windows 10.

2
00:00:04.997 --> 00:00:07.334
To start, we'll come over to the Start menu,

3
00:00:07.334 --> 00:00:08.113
I'll type printer,

4
00:00:08.113 --> 00:00:12.359
and we see under system settings there is a Printers and scanners heading.

5
00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:13.925
So let's maximize the view here.

6
00:00:13.925 --> 00:00:17.466
We see some that just come along for the ride by default.

7
00:00:17.466 --> 00:00:20.809
The Fax software printer, there's the Print to PDF,

8
00:00:20.809 --> 00:00:26.052
and Microsoft still has a virtual printer for its XPS Document Writer.

9
00:00:26.052 --> 00:00:27.827
To add a new printer or scanner,

10
00:00:27.827 --> 00:00:30.909
you really shouldn't have to use this wizard because the truth of

11
00:00:30.909 --> 00:00:33.936
the matter is as soon as you plug in the printer,

12
00:00:33.936 --> 00:00:37.644
Windows should recognize it and load the appropriate driver.

13
00:00:37.644 --> 00:00:40.165
Nonetheless, let me show you the process.

14
00:00:40.165 --> 00:00:43.289
When you click Add, it's going to perform a port search.

15
00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:45.577
Because I don't have a local printer available,

16
00:00:45.577 --> 00:00:48.709
I have one of two choices, plug a printer in,

17
00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:52.721
or print device I should say in, or go down this path,

18
00:00:52.721 --> 00:00:55.001
The printer that I want isn't listed.

19
00:00:55.001 --> 00:00:58.645
And this is interesting here because we can go out to a shared print

20
00:00:58.645 --> 00:01:02.356
queue by name using Universal Naming Convention syntax.

21
00:01:02.356 --> 00:01:06.858
So if the print server is named dc1, I would do \\dc1,

22
00:01:06.858 --> 00:01:10.605
and let's say that that printer's advertised as

23
00:01:10.605 --> 00:01:13.972
office1floor for the first floor office printer,

24
00:01:13.972 --> 00:01:16.581
we can just be done with that.

25
00:01:16.581 --> 00:01:17.997
If we're using Internet Printing Protocol,

26
00:01:17.997 --> 00:01:20.440
then it's going to be a little different yet.

27
00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.653
We would have an HTTP or an HTTPS path of the server,

28
00:01:24.653 --> 00:01:27.768
printer, subdirectory, and then the printer name.

29
00:01:27.768 --> 00:01:31.280
The Browse capability allows us to go out over the network; it

30
00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.506
actually opens up File Explorer to the Network node.

31
00:01:34.506 --> 00:01:37.443
Now this is going to depend upon how your network is set up.

32
00:01:37.443 --> 00:01:39.308
If you've got strong firewalling for instance,

33
00:01:39.308 --> 00:01:41.024
or if you have network discovery turned off,

34
00:01:41.024 --> 00:01:43.890
then that's not going to be a very effective way to do it.

35
00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.829
I find myself that using Universal Naming Conventions is the best way to go.

36
00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.234
If we were going to host a shared printer here on this machine

37
00:01:53.234 --> 00:01:56.496
and we wanted to advertise it over TCP/IP,

38
00:01:56.496 --> 00:02:00.611
we would choose Add a printer using a TCP/IP address or hostname.

39
00:02:00.611 --> 00:02:04.449
There's an option for Bluetooth, wireless, or network discoverable printer.

40
00:02:04.449 --> 00:02:07.623
There's Add a local or network printer with manual settings,

41
00:02:07.623 --> 00:02:11.850
I'll choose that, and in that case, you have to choose a Printer Port,

42
00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.421
and that gets into some really old school hardware,

43
00:02:14.421 --> 00:02:17.919
like the Printer Ports are called Line Printing Ports,

44
00:02:17.919 --> 00:02:18.359
LPT.

45
00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:20.436
The old-school Serial Port is here.

46
00:02:20.436 --> 00:02:22.514
It's quite obvious, to me anyway,

47
00:02:22.514 --> 00:02:25.470
that this Add printer wizard is really meant to be run

48
00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.082
only in a troubleshooting context,

49
00:02:27.082 --> 00:02:31.515
or potentially if you want to connect to a network printer.

50
00:02:31.515 --> 00:02:34.056
But in my experience as a systems administrator,

51
00:02:34.056 --> 00:02:37.446
I configure all network printing on the server side because I

52
00:02:37.446 --> 00:02:41.039
certainly don't want to inconvenience my users and have them

53
00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:43.017
clicking around and getting frustrated.

54
00:02:43.017 --> 00:02:44.287
Do you see what I mean?

55
00:02:44.287 --> 00:02:46.880
I'm actually going to minimize this on this virtual machine,

56
00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.602
and then bring from another machine that same dialog box that

57
00:02:51.602 --> 00:02:54.290
does have a connection to a local printer.

58
00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.370
On this particular machine, notice that I have Adobe Acrobat installed.

59
00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.902
So I have the Adobe PDF printer, I have a live,

60
00:03:02.902 --> 00:03:06.636
an actual HP Officejet Pro connected physically via USB.

61
00:03:06.636 --> 00:03:11.458
Some other software may include a software printer like TechSmith Snagit.

62
00:03:11.458 --> 00:03:16.536
Their screen capture software also gives you a print-to-file capability.

63
00:03:16.536 --> 00:03:20.697
Looks like Microsoft OneNote 2016 does the same thing.

64
00:03:20.697 --> 00:03:22.735
But let me select this physical print device,

65
00:03:22.735 --> 00:03:25.488
and notice that we can Open the queue, Manage,

66
00:03:25.488 --> 00:03:26.967
or Remove the device.

67
00:03:26.967 --> 00:03:30.942
It looks like there's a Windows Store app that's also available.

68
00:03:30.942 --> 00:03:34.401
We could click that link to investigate that if we want to.

69
00:03:34.401 --> 00:03:35.751
If we click Open queue,

70
00:03:35.751 --> 00:03:39.319
then that brings up a dialog box that's been around for a long,

71
00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:40.171
long, long time.

72
00:03:40.171 --> 00:03:45.402
This queue dialog, I just can't tell you how many years this has been around.

73
00:03:45.402 --> 00:03:48.682
So if you've used this, then you already know all about it.

74
00:03:48.682 --> 00:03:52.991
The Printer menu where you can adjust whether it's your default printer or not.

75
00:03:52.991 --> 00:03:55.786
You can go to Printing Preferences, and again,

76
00:03:55.786 --> 00:03:59.357
this is going to determine whether you have a class driver or

77
00:03:59.357 --> 00:04:01.736
whether you have just the device-specific driver,

78
00:04:01.736 --> 00:04:07.307
but it's going to give you options over which tray you're using,

79
00:04:07.307 --> 00:04:09.051
duplexing, collation staples,

80
00:04:09.051 --> 00:04:13.624
all that up to the level at which your printer supports those features.

81
00:04:13.624 --> 00:04:17.392
Just for grins, I brought up an instance of Microsoft Word.

82
00:04:17.392 --> 00:04:20.027
I'm going to go back stage and go to Print here.

83
00:04:20.027 --> 00:04:24.057
In the client experience for printing we can choose which printer want to use.

84
00:04:24.057 --> 00:04:28.466
I'm going to choose my HP, and then if we go to Printer Properties again,

85
00:04:28.466 --> 00:04:32.319
it brings us to the driver and the driver software for that device,

86
00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:33.616
and if I click Print,

87
00:04:33.616 --> 00:04:37.374
we're going to see it show up in the queue and I'm going to

88
00:04:37.374 --> 00:04:38.797
immediately right-click and Pause it.

89
00:04:38.797 --> 00:04:41.745
You might hear some noise in the background as I record.

90
00:04:41.745 --> 00:04:44.894
That is that Officejet Pro springing into action.

91
00:04:44.894 --> 00:04:47.778
I wanted to make sure to pause it as quickly as possible,

92
00:04:47.778 --> 00:04:51.265
I still might not have stopped it in time actually,

93
00:04:51.265 --> 00:04:54.164
but when documents get stuck here in the queue,

94
00:04:54.164 --> 00:04:56.325
this is a good place to troubleshoot.

95
00:04:56.325 --> 00:05:00.756
When you right-click, you can Resume or Restart or Cancel a print job.

96
00:05:00.756 --> 00:05:04.586
You can Pause Printing for the entire queue or just an

97
00:05:04.586 --> 00:05:06.142
individual document within the queue.

98
00:05:06.142 --> 00:05:08.559
I'm going to actually Cancel All Documents here.

99
00:05:08.559 --> 00:05:11.373
And it says, are you sure you want to cancel all documents?

100
00:05:11.373 --> 00:05:13.045
I'm going to answer Yes.

101
00:05:13.045 --> 00:05:16.389
And now it says Deleting - Paused - print job.

102
00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:19.759
That's really all there is to the local printing experience.

103
00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:22.574
It doesn't get more complicated than that really,

104
00:05:22.574 --> 00:05:24.693
and you've probably been there, done that,

105
00:05:24.693 --> 00:05:25.491
bought the t-shirt.

106
00:05:25.491 --> 00:05:29.392
It's predominately about troubleshooting when things go wrong.

107
00:05:29.392 --> 00:05:31.513
Sorry about that background noise.

108
00:05:31.513 --> 00:05:34.483
That is that print device going crazy.

109
00:05:34.483 --> 00:05:36.945
Just for grins to see what else the driver gives us,

110
00:05:36.945 --> 00:05:38.150
if we click Manage here,

111
00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:42.034
it takes us to a separate page where we can Print a test page,

112
00:05:42.034 --> 00:05:45.783
Run a troubleshooting wizard, look at the Printer properties.

113
00:05:45.783 --> 00:05:47.982
The Printer properties is actually pretty useful.

114
00:05:47.982 --> 00:05:50.259
Let me click that and show you.

115
00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:54.660
If we go over to Sharing, there's a button for Additional Drivers,

116
00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:57.927
and it'll list what driver is currently installed.

117
00:05:57.927 --> 00:06:00.910
And it looks like I have some updating to do on this machine.

118
00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:03.537
It's a Type 3 - User Mode driver.

119
00:06:03.537 --> 00:06:04.851
It's not type 4.

120
00:06:04.851 --> 00:06:06.304
So actually after I stop recording,

121
00:06:06.304 --> 00:06:10.466
I'm going to go ahead and visit the HP site and make sure

122
00:06:10.466 --> 00:06:12.933
I'm downloading the latest and greatest.

123
00:06:12.933 --> 00:06:15.401
Now it says that the app is actually installed.

124
00:06:15.401 --> 00:06:16.341
I didn't know that.

125
00:06:16.341 --> 00:06:17.987
I'm learning this right along with you.

126
00:06:17.987 --> 00:06:19.800
I'll click Open printer app,

127
00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:23.501
and this is the trusted Windows Store app that evidently

128
00:06:23.501 --> 00:06:25.906
came down through an update process,

129
00:06:25.906 --> 00:06:29.634
and so presumably I not only can manage all aspects of

130
00:06:29.634 --> 00:06:31.597
this device from this dedicated app,

131
00:06:31.597 --> 00:06:35.830
but I can also get to settings and more robust metadata.

132
00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:39.018
So I guess that's another nod in the direction of the

133
00:06:39.018 --> 00:06:48.000
importance of going for the device-specific drivers, in particular, the drivers that are published by the vendor itself.
