1
00:00:00,361 --> 00:00:01,538
In this demo,

2
00:00:01,538 --> 00:00:06,466
we'll look at the so-called Windows 7 Backup and Recovery tools in Windows 10.

3
00:00:06,466 --> 00:00:10,186
To do that, I'm going to open a Run prompt and open Control,

4
00:00:10,186 --> 00:00:14,569
because this is a tool that exists in the legacy or classic Control Panel.

5
00:00:14,569 --> 00:00:18,991
If I type backup, it brings us to Backup and Restore Windows 7.

6
00:00:18,991 --> 00:00:22,853
Remember that this has the Windows 7 to remind us that

7
00:00:22,853 --> 00:00:26,712
File History is the current gen backup, but it's not exactly.

8
00:00:26,712 --> 00:00:30,944
The Backup and Restore for Windows 7 allows you to do file and

9
00:00:30,944 --> 00:00:33,649
folder backup as well as system image backup,

10
00:00:33,649 --> 00:00:35,348
you see what I mean?

11
00:00:35,348 --> 00:00:38,315
Now this Windows backup hasn't been set up yet on this computer,

12
00:00:38,315 --> 00:00:41,509
so we have a user account control to set it up,

13
00:00:41,509 --> 00:00:44,020
and let's actually step through this wizard together.

14
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:45,895
First we're asked where you want to save.

15
00:00:45,895 --> 00:00:50,275
You can go out onto the network or you would choose a disk volume,

16
00:00:50,275 --> 00:00:53,543
either a fixed volume or removable storage that has

17
00:00:53,543 --> 00:00:56,394
enough space on it to store your data.

18
00:00:56,394 --> 00:00:57,474
I'm going to choose Drive F.

19
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:58,735
What do you want to back up?

20
00:00:58,735 --> 00:01:02,922
You can either let Windows choose, or you can take control of the process.

21
00:01:02,922 --> 00:01:04,939
I'm going to choose Let me choose.

22
00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:06,957
If you choose Include a system image,

23
00:01:06,957 --> 00:01:10,536
it's going to snapshot both the System Reserved partition that

24
00:01:10,536 --> 00:01:13,119
contains your boot files and your C drive,

25
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:14,411
which is your system.

26
00:01:14,411 --> 00:01:17,174
This is going to give your entire environment back

27
00:01:17,174 --> 00:01:18,709
snapshotted as of this moment.

28
00:01:18,709 --> 00:01:22,603
Alternatively, you can pick out volumes manually as you see here.

29
00:01:22,603 --> 00:01:24,727
Specifically, you can go into data files,

30
00:01:24,727 --> 00:01:28,338
you can go into your libraries, data for newly created users,

31
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:30,128
step through it that way.

32
00:01:30,128 --> 00:01:31,558
Save settings and run backup,

33
00:01:31,558 --> 00:01:34,951
that's going to go ahead and take off and run that backup,

34
00:01:34,951 --> 00:01:36,056
as you see here.

35
00:01:36,056 --> 00:01:36,884
We have metadata.

36
00:01:36,884 --> 00:01:38,319
Here is the backup target,

37
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:41,856
here is backup in terms of whether you've created a schedule.

38
00:01:41,856 --> 00:01:44,341
I've just selected the defaults here.

39
00:01:44,341 --> 00:01:48,276
So it's grabbing a system image, it's grabbing file system data separately,

40
00:01:48,276 --> 00:01:52,657
storing it on Drive F, and the default setting is that every Sunday at 7:00 P.

41
00:01:52,657 --> 00:01:55,251
M my local time it's going to rerun the backup.

42
00:01:55,251 --> 00:01:58,274
We can change that schedule right here, as you see.

43
00:01:58,274 --> 00:02:01,213
I'm going to switch over to another machine that already has

44
00:02:01,213 --> 00:02:03,626
had these backups going on for a while.

45
00:02:03,626 --> 00:02:07,085
So if I reinvoke the Control Panel and type backup,

46
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:11,378
Restore data files or computer from backup (Windows 7).

47
00:02:11,378 --> 00:02:14,198
Again, it takes us to the Backup and Restore wizard.

48
00:02:14,198 --> 00:02:19,576
You can look at your last backup results that says that the backup completed,

49
00:02:19,576 --> 00:02:20,980
but some files were skipped,

50
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:25,882
and it looks like it had a problem backing up my contents due to a WAIT error,

51
00:02:25,882 --> 00:02:29,690
so that would be something to check out and test if I wanted to.

52
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:33,773
We can change the backup job settings by invoking the Windows

53
00:02:33,773 --> 00:02:37,487
Backup tool separately and examining the properties of whatever

54
00:02:37,487 --> 00:02:39,685
backup job parameters I had set,

55
00:02:39,685 --> 00:02:42,695
and by doing this it'll allow us to customize the

56
00:02:42,695 --> 00:02:44,802
schedule if we want to create one.

57
00:02:44,802 --> 00:02:47,576
I'm going to cancel, we don't need to actually do that.

58
00:02:47,576 --> 00:02:49,896
So that's the long story short.

59
00:02:49,896 --> 00:02:53,778
The legacy Backup and Restore, it's good for creating system images,

60
00:02:53,778 --> 00:02:56,424
also good for picking out files and folders,

61
00:02:56,424 --> 00:03:00,959
even though Microsoft wants us to use File History as much as possible.

62
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,391
As far as the Restore workflow,

63
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:05,807
you see that again in the Backup and Restore Windows 7 Control Panel.

64
00:03:05,807 --> 00:03:08,919
We have that you can restore your files that were

65
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:11,933
backed up to the current location, Restore my Files.

66
00:03:11,933 --> 00:03:16,010
It looks like on the system I must not have done a file and folder backup,

67
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:18,306
but instead just did a system image backup,

68
00:03:18,306 --> 00:03:22,443
but if I had backed up individual files and folders I can select them,

69
00:03:22,443 --> 00:03:27,798
sort of like you can select a system restore point that matches your timeframe,

70
00:03:27,798 --> 00:03:31,434
and it's going to put those files back in their original location.

71
00:03:31,434 --> 00:03:33,604
So be careful about that option.

72
00:03:33,604 --> 00:03:37,331
The common criticism I've heard and what I've experienced in practice,

73
00:03:37,331 --> 00:03:40,222
is that this utility is fairly, not inflexible,

74
00:03:40,222 --> 00:03:44,857
but it's less flexible than many shareware products out there,

75
00:03:44,857 --> 00:03:45,975
for that matter.

76
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:49,065
There's independent software vendors like CloudBerry Lab who

77
00:03:49,065 --> 00:03:52,266
make fine backup tools that are very expensive,

78
00:03:52,266 --> 00:03:53,232
if not freeware,

79
00:03:53,232 --> 00:03:57,139
that allow you to schedule file and folder backups that run really well.

80
00:03:57,139 --> 00:03:59,659
You can back up to the cloud and so forth.

81
00:03:59,659 --> 00:04:03,525
As you can see, this Backup and Restore surface is showing its age,

82
00:04:03,525 --> 00:04:06,169
and I suspect it's going the way of the Dodo.

83
00:04:06,169 --> 00:04:09,285
If you're wondering, Tim, how do I restore a system restore image,

84
00:04:09,285 --> 00:04:11,974
well in that case we're going to need to reboot the

85
00:04:11,974 --> 00:04:18,000
system into the recovery environment, and we're actually going to do that in the next module.
