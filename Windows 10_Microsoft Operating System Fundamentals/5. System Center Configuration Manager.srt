00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:06,128
What I'm showing you here are various manual methods for inventorying

2
00:00:06,128 --> 00:00:08,615
the software and hardware on a Windows 10 machine,

3
00:00:08,615 --> 00:00:12,402
but in an enterprise where you may be responsible for dozens,

4
00:00:12,402 --> 00:00:16,042
hundreds, thousands, or tens of thousands of systems,

5
00:00:16,042 --> 00:00:19,197
it's obviously impossible, not to say impractical,

6
00:00:19,197 --> 00:00:21,390
to do these manual tasks.

7
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:24,377
When you get to enterprise-level configuration management,

8
00:00:24,377 --> 00:00:28,393
that's where tools like good old System Center Configuration Manager,

9
00:00:28,393 --> 00:00:31,343
which I've mentioned a lot in this course thus far,

10
00:00:31,343 --> 00:00:32,676
can automate that aggregation,

11
00:00:32,676 --> 00:00:37,544
and you can generate reports across all your workstations on any hardware.

12
00:00:37,544 --> 00:00:40,631
Show me machines that have such and so a network card,

13
00:00:40,631 --> 00:00:43,781
show me machines that are running this version of Windows,

14
00:00:43,781 --> 00:00:45,278
but in this context here,

15
00:00:45,278 --> 00:00:48,360
this is perfect to get you started because you have to

16
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,959
learn to --- what's that old saying?

17
00:00:49,959 --> 00:00:57,000
You have to learn to crawl before you can walk, and you have to walk before you can run.
