00:00:02.297 --> 00:00:03.714
Now let's look at the task bar.

2
00:00:03.714 --> 00:00:07.505
By the way, if you're thinking, Tim, aren't you going to show us any of this?

3
00:00:07.505 --> 00:00:08.296
I absolutely am.

4
00:00:08.296 --> 00:00:10.985
In each module, I'll have two to four demos.

5
00:00:10.985 --> 00:00:12.683
In this module, I have two.

6
00:00:12.683 --> 00:00:14.663
What I'm doing is chunking them up.

7
00:00:14.663 --> 00:00:17.368
So I'll go through some features and then we'll do a

8
00:00:17.368 --> 00:00:21.468
demo and cover those features, okay.

9
00:00:21.468 --> 00:00:25.218
For historical perspective, the first Windows version that had a task bar,

10
00:00:25.218 --> 00:00:26.346
and if you don't know,

11
00:00:26.346 --> 00:00:30.022
the task bar is that horizontal band at the bottom of the screen,

12
00:00:30.022 --> 00:00:33.014
was in Windows 95 released in August 1995,

13
00:00:33.014 --> 00:00:34.188
and as you can see,

14
00:00:34.188 --> 00:00:39.638
it provided a convenient way to switch among open applications and open windows.

15
00:00:39.638 --> 00:00:42.150
The Windows 10 taskbar is basically the same,

16
00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.595
but it has some really nifty enhancements,

17
00:00:44.595 --> 00:00:47.924
for instance, your running applications have a little,

18
00:00:47.924 --> 00:00:50.323
I think it's dark blue, but I'm color blind,

19
00:00:50.323 --> 00:00:51.714
so don't trust my color,

20
00:00:51.714 --> 00:00:56.382
but notice that the edge icon in this screenshot has a thin line below it,

21
00:00:56.382 --> 00:00:58.445
that's to denote that it's a running app.

22
00:00:58.445 --> 00:01:02.117
And by default, when you hover your mouse over an app on the taskbar,

23
00:01:02.117 --> 00:01:04.978
you get a little preview window and that's a live preview.

24
00:01:04.978 --> 00:01:07.224
If you're running a YouTube video, you can actually,

25
00:01:07.224 --> 00:01:11.065
if you want to, watch the video via that little peak thumbnail.

26
00:01:11.065 --> 00:01:14.182
Another thing you can do is right-click an icon on the taskbar,

27
00:01:14.182 --> 00:01:17.105
this opens what's called the jump list and the options

28
00:01:17.105 --> 00:01:19.796
you see here will be context sensitive.

29
00:01:19.796 --> 00:01:20.703
For instance,

30
00:01:20.703 --> 00:01:23.971
I'm right-clicking Windows PowerShell here and notice that I can

31
00:01:23.971 --> 00:01:27.910
open a PowerShell console as an administrator or I can open up

32
00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.212
the graphical PowerShell editor, the ISE.

33
00:01:30.212 --> 00:01:30.501
Again,

34
00:01:30.501 --> 00:01:32.810
you're going to have different options based on

35
00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.407
different applications how they're written.

36
00:01:34.407 --> 00:01:37.228
If you right-click an empty area of the taskbar,

37
00:01:37.228 --> 00:01:39.231
you get a whole bunch of options.

38
00:01:39.231 --> 00:01:43.829
This is where you can turn on or turn off the different toolbars,

39
00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.516
Cortana functionality, whether you see her or not,

40
00:01:46.516 --> 00:01:47.872
you can adjust windows,

41
00:01:47.872 --> 00:01:53.319
you can lock or unlock the taskbar which allows you to either resize it or not,

42
00:01:53.319 --> 00:02:00.000
and importantly, you can get down to your taskbar specific settings, which I'll show you in our demo.
