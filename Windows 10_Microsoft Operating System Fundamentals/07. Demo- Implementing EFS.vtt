00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.604
Encrypting File System refers to the ability to encrypt individual files.

2
00:00:05.604 --> 00:00:08.381
So I have a folder here called my files,

3
00:00:08.381 --> 00:00:11.445
and I have a Work Journal file that is a secret

4
00:00:11.445 --> 00:00:13.918
document where only I should read it.

5
00:00:13.918 --> 00:00:16.548
Now we can use NTFS security, that's true,

6
00:00:16.548 --> 00:00:19.100
and we'll learn more about that in the next module,

7
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.173
but if you really want to be serious about your file level security,

8
00:00:23.173 --> 00:00:25.009
we can right-click and go to Properties,

9
00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:28.222
and then on the Advanced properties on the General page,

10
00:00:28.222 --> 00:00:31.263
we can choose Encrypt contents to secure data.

11
00:00:31.263 --> 00:00:32.399
Click OK, OK,

12
00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.942
and it says you're encrypting a file that's in an unencrypted folder.

13
00:00:36.942 --> 00:00:38.781
If this file is modified,

14
00:00:38.781 --> 00:00:42.092
the editing software might store a temporary unencrypted copy.

15
00:00:42.092 --> 00:00:44.625
So let's actually encrypt the entire folder.

16
00:00:44.625 --> 00:00:47.921
You see now that the folder has a lock on it,

17
00:00:47.921 --> 00:00:51.704
and the document itself, it used to be they would turn green.

18
00:00:51.704 --> 00:00:55.181
I'm colorblind, so I have no idea what color that is.

19
00:00:55.181 --> 00:00:57.643
Let me go to View Extra large icons.

20
00:00:57.643 --> 00:01:00.770
I guess now, it looks like it displays with a lock on it.

21
00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:01.273
That's fine.

22
00:01:01.273 --> 00:01:04.546
What I'm actually going to do here is go to my D drive,

23
00:01:04.546 --> 00:01:09.638
that's an NTFS volume, and I'm going to move this to a new destination.

24
00:01:09.638 --> 00:01:11.402
The question now is going to be,

25
00:01:11.402 --> 00:01:14.829
is that file still protected if I log on as another user?

26
00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:17.297
So let me choose the User menu.

27
00:01:17.297 --> 00:01:23.384
Let me sign out, and I'm going to login in as Liz, another user in my company.

28
00:01:23.384 --> 00:01:24.100
pri domain.

29
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.485
Let's complete her process here.

30
00:01:25.485 --> 00:01:29.114
All right, we're logged in, so now let's open up File Explorer,

31
00:01:29.114 --> 00:01:31.818
go to drive D, there's the myfiles folder.

32
00:01:31.818 --> 00:01:33.654
And when I double left-click Work Journal,

33
00:01:33.654 --> 00:01:36.590
it says you do not have permission to open this file.

34
00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.119
See the owner of the file or an administrator to obtain permission.

35
00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:43.557
And if we adjust the view to extra large icons,

36
00:01:43.557 --> 00:01:46.433
we can see that that file is encrypted.

37
00:01:46.433 --> 00:01:48.956
If we go to Properties and go to Details,

38
00:01:48.956 --> 00:01:52.245
we can see that the owner is the Tim account,

39
00:01:52.245 --> 00:01:52.688
DEVBOX\Tim.

40
00:01:52.688 --> 00:01:58.012
So now we'll sign out as Liz Noto; I'll sign back in as myself,

41
00:01:58.012 --> 00:02:03.007
and this time, I'll open up Run and just do the path directly to d:\my files,

42
00:02:03.007 --> 00:02:05.326
and I have access to that file.

43
00:02:05.326 --> 00:02:08.337
Now that EFS is transparent-file level encryption.

44
00:02:08.337 --> 00:02:12.427
It can be a little scary in terms of how easy it is to do that,

45
00:02:12.427 --> 00:02:15.815
but what's going on under the hood is that my Tim user has

46
00:02:15.815 --> 00:02:17.880
a certificate that allows that to work.

47
00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.092
Let's again go back to Run, and I'm going to open up certmgr.

48
00:02:22.092 --> 00:02:22.436
msc.

49
00:02:22.436 --> 00:02:26.205
If you're thinking, Tim, what's with all these msc's in file names?

50
00:02:26.205 --> 00:02:27.402
Should you know them?

51
00:02:27.402 --> 00:02:28.547
You want to know what?

52
00:02:28.547 --> 00:02:28.776
Yes,

53
00:02:28.776 --> 00:02:32.421
you should because it's going to save you a heck of a lot of time when

54
00:02:32.421 --> 00:02:34.460
you're doing this kind of work for your customers.

55
00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.803
It's always faster to do something command line than click

56
00:02:37.803 --> 00:02:40.035
through a whole bunch of different windows,

57
00:02:40.035 --> 00:02:40.347
really.

58
00:02:40.347 --> 00:02:42.364
So I'm looking at the certificate,

59
00:02:42.364 --> 00:02:46.330
the digital certificate store of my currently logged-on user,

60
00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.089
and in the Personal store, we have a container called Certificates.

61
00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:52.481
And if you look at Intended Purpose,

62
00:02:52.481 --> 00:02:55.214
we have an Encrypting File System certificate here.

63
00:02:55.214 --> 00:02:56.190
If this gets deleted,

64
00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.137
I'm not going to be able to work with my encrypted files anymore forever,

65
00:03:00.137 --> 00:03:03.431
and unless I'm in a domain environment where there's

66
00:03:03.431 --> 00:03:06.186
at least one data recovery agent, I'm hosed.

67
00:03:06.186 --> 00:03:10.149
So you want to make a backup of your files, big time.

68
00:03:10.149 --> 00:03:11.779
How do you do that?

69
00:03:11.779 --> 00:03:15.040
Well, you right-click the file, go to All Tasks, Export.

70
00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.745
And we step through the wizard.

71
00:03:16.745 --> 00:03:21.268
We want to export the entire certificate, public and private key parts.

72
00:03:21.268 --> 00:03:23.346
I'll leave the default format.

73
00:03:23.346 --> 00:03:27.115
Definitely encrypt it with a password, with a strong password.

74
00:03:27.115 --> 00:03:29.348
It's just like the BitLocker encryption key.

75
00:03:29.348 --> 00:03:30.934
This is super-sensitive information here.

76
00:03:30.934 --> 00:03:33.443
And then where are you going to store it?

77
00:03:33.443 --> 00:03:34.829
I'll go to my drive D.

78
00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:36.468
I'll put it on the root there,

79
00:03:36.468 --> 00:03:39.011
but obviously I want to take it off the computer

80
00:03:39.011 --> 00:03:42.056
and keep it in a secure location.

81
00:03:42.056 --> 00:03:45.641
So that's backing up the encrypting file system key.

82
00:03:45.641 --> 00:03:48.509
Let's finish this discussion with our BitLocker.

83
00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:51.761
Let's go open up the BitLocker Control Panel again,

84
00:03:51.761 --> 00:03:53.984
and it's asking for a restart.

85
00:03:53.984 --> 00:03:58.487
Yep, so let's restart the computer using PowerShell, restart-computer -force.

86
00:03:58.487 --> 00:04:02.150
And let's encrypt this drive.

87
00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.582
Now if you're using a startup password to unlock the drive,

88
00:04:05.582 --> 00:04:07.867
this is the screen that you see.

89
00:04:07.867 --> 00:04:09.499
If you're using just TPM,

90
00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:12.755
then as long as you're logging onto the computer that can access the TPM,

91
00:04:12.755 --> 00:04:14.544
the system will start normally.

92
00:04:14.544 --> 00:04:18.485
But this is certainly another layer of protection that you can add.

93
00:04:18.485 --> 00:04:23.611
Notice it says Press Enter to continue or Press Esc for BitLocker recovery.

94
00:04:23.611 --> 00:04:27.482
If you press Esc, we go into the Windows recovery environment,

95
00:04:27.482 --> 00:04:30.469
and in that recovery environment, you'll need to type,

96
00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:34.009
hand type the recovery key that you will have backed up,

97
00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:38.251
potentially printed off, stored in a safe or in your MBAM environment,

98
00:04:38.251 --> 00:04:43.000
if you're using BitLocker Administration. You can retrieve it that way.
