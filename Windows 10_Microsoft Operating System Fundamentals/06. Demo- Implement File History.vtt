00:00:00.247 --> 00:00:05.431
Okay, in this demonstration we'll look at File History and OneDrive.

2
00:00:05.431 --> 00:00:10.498
I've become a fan of Windows key + Q and just typing what I want in Cortana.

3
00:00:10.498 --> 00:00:15.162
I'll type file history, and it wants to open up File History from Control Panel,

4
00:00:15.162 --> 00:00:16.006
now that's interesting.

5
00:00:16.006 --> 00:00:18.821
And this actually brings us not to what I wanted.

6
00:00:18.821 --> 00:00:22.118
This brings us to the Restore or Recovery interface.

7
00:00:22.118 --> 00:00:23.730
Okay, let's try this again.

8
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.275
Let me just hit the Start button and type file history.

9
00:00:27.275 --> 00:00:32.225
That, again, wants to open the File History Control Panel to restore files,

10
00:00:32.225 --> 00:00:34.915
but that assumes that we've already got the feature enabled.

11
00:00:34.915 --> 00:00:39.961
We want, in the Settings app Backup settings, at least that's one way to do it.

12
00:00:39.961 --> 00:00:43.566
File History is a little bit gnarly in terms of you can enable it

13
00:00:43.566 --> 00:00:47.032
in both Control Panel and in the Settings app.

14
00:00:47.032 --> 00:00:48.569
Let me show you what I mean.

15
00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:50.546
I'll put the Settings app over on one side,

16
00:00:50.546 --> 00:00:52.859
and now I'll right-click Start, go to Run,

17
00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:55.765
and type control to open the classic Control Panel,

18
00:00:55.765 --> 00:00:59.416
and I'm going to search in there for file history,

19
00:00:59.416 --> 00:01:01.484
and we see a File History entry right here,

20
00:01:01.484 --> 00:01:04.406
so there's two separate interfaces for the same thing.

21
00:01:04.406 --> 00:01:07.473
Now if File History is turned off, you can turn it on.

22
00:01:07.473 --> 00:01:10.480
Let me actually switch to another machine that does

23
00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.487
not have File History turned on.

24
00:01:12.487 --> 00:01:16.976
This time I'll type backup to go directly to the Backup Settings setting.

25
00:01:16.976 --> 00:01:22.167
You add a drive that serves as a repository for your File History.

26
00:01:22.167 --> 00:01:27.698
So this is normally a large capacity USB external drive that you plan to

27
00:01:27.698 --> 00:01:29.973
permanently connect to your Windows 10 workstation,

28
00:01:29.973 --> 00:01:33.671
again, to repeat what I had going on in my other machine,

29
00:01:33.671 --> 00:01:36.442
we'll also open up the classic Control Panel and

30
00:01:36.442 --> 00:01:38.598
look at File History as well here.

31
00:01:38.598 --> 00:01:40.217
So File History is off.

32
00:01:40.217 --> 00:01:45.091
If we turn it on, it automatically chooses the biggest disk on my system.

33
00:01:45.091 --> 00:01:48.899
I do have an F drive called Drive F here.

34
00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.043
If we go to Add a drive, it searches,

35
00:01:51.043 --> 00:01:54.139
and we're going to actually need to refresh the view here.

36
00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:59.079
Let me go back Home, and go back to Backup settings, and it should refresh.

37
00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:01.311
Yep, it's gone from Off to On.

38
00:02:01.311 --> 00:02:04.800
If we go to More options here, it tells us what we've got going on.

39
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.870
We can do a backup right now, we can backup from every 10 minutes to daily,

40
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:12.122
the hour is the default, keep my backups forever,

41
00:02:12.122 --> 00:02:16.348
and then it gives us a list of folders that are monitored,

42
00:02:16.348 --> 00:02:19.147
including OneDrive, the Desktop folder, Downloads,

43
00:02:19.147 --> 00:02:23.044
Contacts, it grabs your library data as well.

44
00:02:23.044 --> 00:02:25.106
You can explicitly exclude folders,

45
00:02:25.106 --> 00:02:29.925
you can stop using this drive and point File History to another drive if,

46
00:02:29.925 --> 00:02:31.834
for instance, you're running out of space.

47
00:02:31.834 --> 00:02:34.050
There's actually more going on in Settings than

48
00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.253
there is here in old Control Panel,

49
00:02:36.253 --> 00:02:40.339
so let's just focus specifically here on the Settings experience,

50
00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:42.224
let me go above.

51
00:02:42.224 --> 00:02:46.999
You can always manually add additional folders to be included in file backup,

52
00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:51.601
and then, as I said, you can run backups either automatically on a schedule,

53
00:02:51.601 --> 00:02:54.413
or you could do it ad hoc as you saw here.

54
00:02:54.413 --> 00:02:58.613
I have been running File History on this other machine for a little while now,

55
00:02:58.613 --> 00:03:03.272
so the idea is if we lose a file we can get it back.

56
00:03:03.272 --> 00:03:06.709
So, for instance, let me go into my Downloads folder,

57
00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:10.525
sort my files by name, and let's just take this App1.

58
00:03:10.525 --> 00:03:13.912
publishsetttings file and I'm going to delete it and actually

59
00:03:13.912 --> 00:03:16.809
empty the Recycle bin so that file is gone,

60
00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:17.131
right?

61
00:03:17.131 --> 00:03:19.879
Well as long as I have File History running,

62
00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:24.705
I can start key Q, file history, Restore your files with File History,

63
00:03:24.705 --> 00:03:28.650
and the Restore interface is strictly old Control Panel.

64
00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.681
If you've ever used Apple Time Machine,

65
00:03:31.681 --> 00:03:35.166
this isn't as glitzy an interface as Time Machine,

66
00:03:35.166 --> 00:03:36.779
but it's better than nothing.

67
00:03:36.779 --> 00:03:39.036
Now notice it'll say x of y.

68
00:03:39.036 --> 00:03:41.989
Depending up on how many snapshots it's taken,

69
00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:45.752
you can move back and forth here through those different snapshots,

70
00:03:45.752 --> 00:03:48.997
and it gives you a run of all of your locations.

71
00:03:48.997 --> 00:03:51.331
I have, let's see it would be Downloads wouldn't it,

72
00:03:51.331 --> 00:03:54.700
so let's browse into Downloads, and there's the App1.

73
00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:55.590
publishsettings file.

74
00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.525
Now this is as of two days ago, so again,

75
00:03:58.525 --> 00:04:02.548
you might want to be more robust in how often File History checks,

76
00:04:02.548 --> 00:04:03.518
but you know,

77
00:04:03.518 --> 00:04:09.325
even to get the file back as of two days ago is a pretty big win it seems to me.

78
00:04:09.325 --> 00:04:11.803
If I right-click, I can preview the file.

79
00:04:11.803 --> 00:04:13.333
In some cases, it can preview.

80
00:04:13.333 --> 00:04:16.319
This is an xml format file, so it's a little non-standard.

81
00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:21.513
We can open it up here, and we can save off a copy of it.

82
00:04:21.513 --> 00:04:23.400
Maybe I'll peel it off into the desktop.

83
00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.706
This is good not only for recovery purposes,

84
00:04:25.706 --> 00:04:27.487
but also for versioning,

85
00:04:27.487 --> 00:04:32.440
if you want to compare an earlier version of a file with a current one,

86
00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:32.985
you see?

87
00:04:32.985 --> 00:04:35.864
Let me step back, let me select this file,

88
00:04:35.864 --> 00:04:38.300
and then click Restore to original location,

89
00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.646
and it automatically opened up my Downloads folder,

90
00:04:41.646 --> 00:04:42.977
and there's the file.

91
00:04:42.977 --> 00:04:47.423
So as you can see, File History is largely a set it and forget it operation,

92
00:04:47.423 --> 00:04:50.000
it's pretty awesome. Now here's my OneDrive.
