1
00:00:02,752 --> 00:00:06,229
Windows 10 Post-Installation Tasks.

2
00:00:06,229 --> 00:00:09,716
Now I mentioned that you'll need to choose your edition when you

3
00:00:09,716 --> 00:00:12,068
install Windows and you may not have had a choice,

4
00:00:12,068 --> 00:00:12,773
like I said,

5
00:00:12,773 --> 00:00:15,937
your original equipment manufacturer may have given you Windows 10

6
00:00:15,937 --> 00:00:20,203
Home and then later you realize that you want to do some homework from

7
00:00:20,203 --> 00:00:22,228
work and you need a professional edition,

8
00:00:22,228 --> 00:00:23,674
how do you do that?

9
00:00:23,674 --> 00:00:26,933
Well, it's nice that we have this anytime upgrade feature.

10
00:00:26,933 --> 00:00:28,973
Again, we talk about upgrade later in the course,

11
00:00:28,973 --> 00:00:30,998
so I don't want to spill too much now,

12
00:00:30,998 --> 00:00:33,950
but I'll show you in the demo how to change the product

13
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:36,971
key and unlock different edition levels.

14
00:00:36,971 --> 00:00:38,970
Common point of confusion for many,

15
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:42,389
even those in IT is understanding Windows 10 versions,

16
00:00:42,389 --> 00:00:44,283
builds, and update branches.

17
00:00:44,283 --> 00:00:47,609
Here's the deal, you look on the left side of the screen,

18
00:00:47,609 --> 00:00:49,504
there are various servicing options.

19
00:00:49,504 --> 00:00:51,398
This is used in business.

20
00:00:51,398 --> 00:00:52,772
For a consumer user,

21
00:00:52,772 --> 00:00:56,566
they're just going to use Windows update normally and you're off and running.

22
00:00:56,566 --> 00:01:00,891
All I want to say about that is that when you're working with your friends,

23
00:01:00,891 --> 00:01:02,676
colleagues, family, your customers,

24
00:01:02,676 --> 00:01:07,549
make sure to encourage them to always keep Windows update on and functioning.

25
00:01:07,549 --> 00:01:09,362
So much devastating malware,

26
00:01:09,362 --> 00:01:13,247
ransomware comes to mind comes through unpatched operating systems.

27
00:01:13,247 --> 00:01:17,091
I know that some people are resistant to doing updates.

28
00:01:17,091 --> 00:01:19,338
Consumer customers of mine, for instance,

29
00:01:19,338 --> 00:01:22,251
their main complaint is I don't want to install an update

30
00:01:22,251 --> 00:01:24,609
that's going to change how I do my work.

31
00:01:24,609 --> 00:01:25,653
In the business world,

32
00:01:25,653 --> 00:01:29,033
administrators tend to resist update sometimes because they're

33
00:01:29,033 --> 00:01:31,786
afraid of a failure of regression testing,

34
00:01:31,786 --> 00:01:32,951
in other words,

35
00:01:32,951 --> 00:01:36,046
this update may break line of business services that

36
00:01:36,046 --> 00:01:37,974
are working just fine right now.

37
00:01:37,974 --> 00:01:38,582
Thank you.

38
00:01:38,582 --> 00:01:40,406
That's another discussion for another time,

39
00:01:40,406 --> 00:01:43,285
but what I want you to know is that Microsoft when

40
00:01:43,285 --> 00:01:46,218
they deployed Windows 10 to us, when they gave it to us,

41
00:01:46,218 --> 00:01:48,969
there were a number of update branches that you could

42
00:01:48,969 --> 00:01:51,751
associate with for a lack of a better term.

43
00:01:51,751 --> 00:01:54,029
The Windows inside our channel is still around today

44
00:01:54,029 --> 00:01:56,088
and this is for those brave souls,

45
00:01:56,088 --> 00:02:00,405
both business and consumer customers who want to evaluate the latest

46
00:02:00,405 --> 00:02:04,647
and greatest non-release versions of Windows 10 and the tradeoff

47
00:02:04,647 --> 00:02:07,976
there is that you're asked to give feedback to Microsoft and it helps

48
00:02:07,976 --> 00:02:09,567
them build the product better.

49
00:02:09,567 --> 00:02:12,508
You see in the first column, all of these things,

50
00:02:12,508 --> 00:02:16,879
long-term servicing branch, current branch for business is really confusing.

51
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:22,621
Fortunately now, we have basically three ways to update or service Windows 10.

52
00:02:22,621 --> 00:02:26,811
In business, there is the Windows insider, which is not for production use.

53
00:02:26,811 --> 00:02:29,145
You would do that only in your testing environment.

54
00:02:29,145 --> 00:02:33,207
Semi-annual or targeted is the most common one and this is what customers,

55
00:02:33,207 --> 00:02:37,769
what consumer customers have on their systems where Microsoft does

56
00:02:37,769 --> 00:02:41,526
monthly patches second Tuesday of every month,

57
00:02:41,526 --> 00:02:43,814
so-called Patch Tuesday, but twice a month,

58
00:02:43,814 --> 00:02:47,329
you can expect in the Spring and in the Fall,

59
00:02:47,329 --> 00:02:49,586
Microsoft will release a big update.

60
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:52,922
The Fall updates, for instance, are normally called the creator's updates,

61
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:55,669
at least they have for the last year or so.

62
00:02:55,669 --> 00:03:00,405
And this allows IT administrators to budget time and testing resources

63
00:03:00,405 --> 00:03:03,770
before they update all of the computers on their network.

64
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:07,990
The other way to go is the long-term servicing branch that you see down

65
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:10,749
at the bottom and that's for specialized devices.

66
00:03:10,749 --> 00:03:14,347
That's not for ordinary desktop or laptop computers.

67
00:03:14,347 --> 00:03:17,596
This is where you really could hose up something important

68
00:03:17,596 --> 00:03:21,851
like a medical device by updating and then having a bug or

69
00:03:21,851 --> 00:03:23,653
a problem rear its head.

70
00:03:23,653 --> 00:03:28,448
So it allows you to get away with updating as infrequently as possible.

71
00:03:28,448 --> 00:03:31,813
So just looking at that row there, the semi-annual channel row,

72
00:03:31,813 --> 00:03:35,992
notice the version number, 1709, that actually is meaningful.

73
00:03:35,992 --> 00:03:42,434
That means September 2017, the 17 is 2017, 9 is September.

74
00:03:42,434 --> 00:03:48,221
So the previous big update this year, 2017, was in March 1703.

75
00:03:48,221 --> 00:03:49,848
So that's the version,

76
00:03:49,848 --> 00:03:54,260
that number will tell you how up-to-date your Windows 10 is.

77
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:57,735
The OS builds are less important for most people.

78
00:03:57,735 --> 00:04:01,248
This is the specific detailed release that you're running.

79
00:04:01,248 --> 00:04:07,000
That might be useful if you're doing troubleshooting and you've asked Microsoft for support.
