1
00:00:00,509 --> 00:00:04,811
Now let's look at work and school accounts.

2
00:00:04,811 --> 00:00:06,585
Work accounts, school account,

3
00:00:06,585 --> 00:00:10,358
and organizational account are all aliases for an

4
00:00:10,358 --> 00:00:12,432
Azure Active Directory account.

5
00:00:12,432 --> 00:00:15,510
To formally define an Azure Active directory is

6
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,112
Microsoft's cloud information store.

7
00:00:17,112 --> 00:00:20,566
Now if you have experience managing on-premises Active Directory,

8
00:00:20,566 --> 00:00:24,696
you wonder if this is the same thing, the answer to that is no,

9
00:00:24,696 --> 00:00:25,680
not at all.

10
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,301
There is not parity between true local forests and

11
00:00:29,301 --> 00:00:32,272
domain Active Directory and Azure AD.

12
00:00:32,272 --> 00:00:36,189
Azure AD is a much simplified account store, okay.

13
00:00:36,189 --> 00:00:41,565
Office 365 actually uses Azure Active Directory for its identity management,

14
00:00:41,565 --> 00:00:44,346
and Microsoft Azure natively uses it.

15
00:00:44,346 --> 00:00:49,182
It's a great flexible store for use in authentication

16
00:00:49,182 --> 00:00:51,701
scenarios with cloud-based applications,

17
00:00:51,701 --> 00:00:54,529
as I've said earlier.

18
00:00:54,529 --> 00:00:59,094
Here is the UI for connecting to an Azure AD account.

19
00:00:59,094 --> 00:01:02,324
As you saw in the first demo, the user experience is still in flux.

20
00:01:02,324 --> 00:01:04,520
Microsoft is gradually, very slowly,

21
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:08,233
migrating the classic Control Panel applets into the Settings app,

22
00:01:08,233 --> 00:01:12,020
but as it is it's very messy with user management,

23
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:14,525
ping-ponging between those two experiences,

24
00:01:14,525 --> 00:01:17,273
and I daresay it's messy even here,

25
00:01:17,273 --> 00:01:22,178
attaching to your Microsoft account and certainly authenticating to Azure AD.

26
00:01:22,178 --> 00:01:25,531
But in settings you go under Accounts, Access work or school,

27
00:01:25,531 --> 00:01:29,697
and you can connect to an Azure AD environment there.

28
00:01:29,697 --> 00:01:31,480
Now what benefits does this give you?

29
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,754
It gives you a few.

30
00:01:32,754 --> 00:01:38,625
One is administrators can use Microsoft Intune to manage the device.

31
00:01:38,625 --> 00:01:40,927
This is good for businesses,

32
00:01:40,927 --> 00:01:45,108
predominantly smaller businesses that don't have the money or the human

33
00:01:45,108 --> 00:01:47,711
resource capital to maintain an on-premises domain.

34
00:01:47,711 --> 00:01:51,437
They can still do device management using Intune,

35
00:01:51,437 --> 00:01:54,464
and to do that you're going to need to actually

36
00:01:54,464 --> 00:01:56,790
register and then join an Azure AD domain.

37
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:00,369
I'll show you that workflow in the next demo, as a matter of fact.

38
00:02:00,369 --> 00:02:02,293
I don't want to get too deeply into this,

39
00:02:02,293 --> 00:02:05,462
because we get beyond the scope of this course strictly speaking,

40
00:02:05,462 --> 00:02:07,334
but that's the main reason.

41
00:02:07,334 --> 00:02:09,955
It's called mobile device management, or MDM.

42
00:02:09,955 --> 00:02:13,141
I'm not a great fan of that term with Windows 10 because,

43
00:02:13,141 --> 00:02:13,406
yeah,

44
00:02:13,406 --> 00:02:16,491
I guess we could consider a Windows 10 phone and

45
00:02:16,491 --> 00:02:18,562
Windows 10 based tablet mobile devices,

46
00:02:18,562 --> 00:02:22,342
but if it's a desktop computer it's not particular mobile,

47
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:25,912
but those desktop computers can be managed right alongside

48
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:29,978
phones and tablets using Microsoft Intune.

49
00:02:29,978 --> 00:02:33,704
Now you may be wondering what is the guidance from the Microsoft

50
00:02:33,704 --> 00:02:35,810
Windows team with these different accounts.

51
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:40,330
Here's the deal, Microsoft accounts are predominantly aimed at the consumer,

52
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:43,114
not for business, for the aforementioned reasons.

53
00:02:43,114 --> 00:02:43,969
In business,

54
00:02:43,969 --> 00:02:48,156
Microsoft suggests that you continue to use Active Directory domain

55
00:02:48,156 --> 00:02:51,616
accounts as your source of authority for your users,

56
00:02:51,616 --> 00:02:53,625
and your baseline for management.

57
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:54,027
However,

58
00:02:54,027 --> 00:02:58,606
you might consider setting up a synchronization between your on-premises Active

59
00:02:58,606 --> 00:03:04,078
Directory to an Azure AD tenant in the Microsoft cloud to facilitate single

60
00:03:04,078 --> 00:03:07,525
sign-on with SaaS apps like Office 365 and others,

61
00:03:07,525 --> 00:03:15,000
and also potentially for integration with Microsoft Intune mobile device management, etc.
