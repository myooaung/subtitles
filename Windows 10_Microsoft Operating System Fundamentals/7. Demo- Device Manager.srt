00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:03,214
In this demonstration,

2
00:00:03,214 --> 00:00:06,081
I'm going to show you Device Manager and the basics

3
00:00:06,081 --> 00:00:07,420
of hardware device management.

4
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:10,978
I'm going to open Start and type device manager.

5
00:00:10,978 --> 00:00:14,591
This is a classic Control Panel utility,

6
00:00:14,591 --> 00:00:19,250
and the interface is exactly the same as it's been ever since Windows 95.

7
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:22,992
We have all detected hardware, and in the case of undetected hardware,

8
00:00:22,992 --> 00:00:25,211
it will show up at the bottom of the list.

9
00:00:25,211 --> 00:00:28,306
And the idea here is you can expand the appropriate

10
00:00:28,306 --> 00:00:30,312
sections to see what's going on,

11
00:00:30,312 --> 00:00:33,185
double left-click an entry to determine whether the

12
00:00:33,185 --> 00:00:35,118
device is in a problem state,

13
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:39,617
although there'll be icons that represent an exclamation mark or question mark,

14
00:00:39,617 --> 00:00:42,731
there'll be --- or an X for that matter,

15
00:00:42,731 --> 00:00:45,857
it'll show the state directly in the Device Manager tree.

16
00:00:45,857 --> 00:00:49,064
You can inspect the specific driver that's being used here.

17
00:00:49,064 --> 00:00:52,478
Go to Driver Details, it gives you the actual file name.

18
00:00:52,478 --> 00:00:56,490
You can update the driver for a device, search automatically,

19
00:00:56,490 --> 00:01:01,516
or browser your computer if you've downloaded the driver manually.

20
00:01:01,516 --> 00:01:03,893
This is something that you'll use on a fairly regular

21
00:01:03,893 --> 00:01:05,793
basis if you're doing PC support.

22
00:01:05,793 --> 00:01:06,585
With troubleshooting,

23
00:01:06,585 --> 00:01:10,161
sometimes it's a good idea to disable a device that

24
00:01:10,161 --> 00:01:13,402
you suspect is causing problems, you can do that from here,

25
00:01:13,402 --> 00:01:16,084
and then restart and use the system for a while,

26
00:01:16,084 --> 00:01:17,747
and if the problem doesn't recur,

27
00:01:17,747 --> 00:01:22,052
you can be pretty confident that the problem is related to that disabled device.

28
00:01:22,052 --> 00:01:25,352
So there's not much more to say about Device Manager.

29
00:01:25,352 --> 00:01:26,933
It is what it is.

30
00:01:26,933 --> 00:01:31,868
It's a handy tool that also shows up in your Computer

31
00:01:31,868 --> 00:01:34,298
Management administrative tool, compmgmt.

32
00:01:34,298 --> 00:01:34,906
msc.

33
00:01:34,906 --> 00:01:40,138
This in Windows 10 is a really nice rollup of several handy dandy tools

34
00:01:40,138 --> 00:01:44,046
including the Task Scheduler for automatic tasks.

35
00:01:44,046 --> 00:01:47,727
A lot of your Automatic Maintenance tasks actually will show up here.

36
00:01:47,727 --> 00:01:50,258
If you look in the Task Scheduler library,

37
00:01:50,258 --> 00:01:53,277
we have Device Manager right here as I said,

38
00:01:53,277 --> 00:01:57,343
we have the Service Control Manager, which we've looked at earlier,

39
00:01:57,343 --> 00:01:59,255
and we have Disk Management.

40
00:01:59,255 --> 00:02:01,464
And for that matter, we have Local Users and Groups.

41
00:02:01,464 --> 00:02:06,161
So we've used quite a few of these MMC consoles over the course of time.

42
00:02:06,161 --> 00:02:08,359
If you feel that computer management is something that

43
00:02:08,359 --> 00:02:10,266
you'll be returning to for a while,

44
00:02:10,266 --> 00:02:14,423
perhaps you can pin it to your Start menu and make it easier to find.

45
00:02:14,423 --> 00:02:16,027
Let me come back to PowerShell,

46
00:02:16,027 --> 00:02:20,642
and I'm going to show you a command line tool called driverquery,

47
00:02:20,642 --> 00:02:22,073
and let's do /?

48
00:02:22,073 --> 00:02:24,220
in order to see its help.

49
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:27,996
This is simply a scriptable command line method for

50
00:02:27,996 --> 00:02:30,355
displaying a list of installed device drivers.

51
00:02:30,355 --> 00:02:31,731
It's as simple as that.

52
00:02:31,731 --> 00:02:35,900
And we have a similar syntax here that we saw in the

53
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,468
previous demo with the systeminfo.

54
00:02:37,468 --> 00:02:38,050
exe tool.

55
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:41,178
So as you saw, if you watched the previous demo,

56
00:02:41,178 --> 00:02:45,886
I kind of bombed that demo because I'm not familiar with these switches.

57
00:02:45,886 --> 00:02:47,528
I don't use them an awful lot.

58
00:02:47,528 --> 00:02:51,503
And quite honestly, thanks to PowerShell, you don't have to memorize this.

59
00:02:51,503 --> 00:02:52,036
You know,

60
00:02:52,036 --> 00:02:54,701
if you're not convinced that PowerShell is really the way

61
00:02:54,701 --> 00:02:56,466
to go for administrative automation,

62
00:02:56,466 --> 00:03:00,515
let me just say that PowerShell has a consistent syntax that

63
00:03:00,515 --> 00:03:03,661
once you learn the basic rules of the language,

64
00:03:03,661 --> 00:03:06,320
you can apply it to any domain at all,

65
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,334
whether it's configuration management or whatever.

66
00:03:09,334 --> 00:03:10,078
By contrast,

67
00:03:10,078 --> 00:03:14,995
these old command line tools all have their own unique sets of parameters.

68
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:19,258
In this case, it's just coincidence that we have some repetition,

69
00:03:19,258 --> 00:03:22,349
some of the parameters are the same as systeminfo.

70
00:03:22,349 --> 00:03:25,425
exe, but just as likely, they're totally different.

71
00:03:25,425 --> 00:03:28,581
So you wind up having to learn separate parameter sets,

72
00:03:28,581 --> 00:03:30,856
many of which are unintuitive, per tool.

73
00:03:30,856 --> 00:03:33,513
It's just not a scalable way to work.

74
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:35,656
Let me run driverquery with no other parameters,

75
00:03:35,656 --> 00:03:37,953
and you can see if we do that,

76
00:03:37,953 --> 00:03:41,749
it just gives us an alphabetized list of drivers that are

77
00:03:41,749 --> 00:03:44,984
available from the driver store on this machine.

78
00:03:44,984 --> 00:03:47,913
And you'll notice you'll see different categories,

79
00:03:47,913 --> 00:03:51,835
File System drivers, that are relevant to the user equation,

80
00:03:51,835 --> 00:03:53,740
what the user's interfacing with.

81
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:56,781
Many of these drivers operate at the Kernel mode,

82
00:03:56,781 --> 00:04:01,611
which is where the operating system has permission to interact with the driver,

83
00:04:01,611 --> 00:04:02,895
but the user doesn't.

84
00:04:02,895 --> 00:04:06,696
There's a fundamental boundary line between what's called Kernel space,

85
00:04:06,696 --> 00:04:09,984
or protected operating system space, and user mode,

86
00:04:09,984 --> 00:04:18,000
which is where the end user can get involved. Just thought I'd give you that little bit of trivia, FYI.
