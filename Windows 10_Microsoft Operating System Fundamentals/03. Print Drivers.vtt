00:00:01.229 --> 00:00:04.301
I mentioned that I have a bit more to say about the driver.

2
00:00:04.301 --> 00:00:08.055
The driver is the software layer between the hardware and the operating system.

3
00:00:08.055 --> 00:00:11.233
It also presents you, the user, with a user interface.

4
00:00:11.233 --> 00:00:12.651
When you install a printer,

5
00:00:12.651 --> 00:00:16.213
normally you just plug it in if it's a local USB printer,

6
00:00:16.213 --> 00:00:19.582
and Windows 10, through the process of Plug and Play,

7
00:00:19.582 --> 00:00:22.317
will determine if it has an appropriate driver.

8
00:00:22.317 --> 00:00:25.771
Sometimes though, that driver may not be exactly what you like.

9
00:00:25.771 --> 00:00:29.366
The print class driver is more or less a generic driver

10
00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:31.428
that can fit many different models.

11
00:00:31.428 --> 00:00:33.949
For instance, in the screenshot you see,

12
00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:37.933
this is a class driver that Plug and Play in Windows 10 handed out,

13
00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:42.914
and notice that the title bar says Xerox WorkCentre 5800 Series.

14
00:00:42.914 --> 00:00:48.543
So this class driver will work with many in that WorkCentre 5800 series.

15
00:00:48.543 --> 00:00:50.680
The problem here is that while it will be functional,

16
00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.014
you'll be able to send basic print jobs,

17
00:00:53.014 --> 00:00:56.333
a lot of advanced capabilities that the print device may

18
00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:58.863
have don't show up in the class driver.

19
00:00:58.863 --> 00:01:00.662
So especially if you have, say,

20
00:01:00.662 --> 00:01:04.058
a multi-function print device that can do more than just print,

21
00:01:04.058 --> 00:01:07.252
you'll want to make sure to use a model-specific driver.

22
00:01:07.252 --> 00:01:08.057
For instance,

23
00:01:08.057 --> 00:01:13.301
this screenshot represents the user interface of the Xerox driver that Xerox

24
00:01:13.301 --> 00:01:17.189
makes themselves for a specific WorkCentre 5800 Series device,

25
00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.605
and not only do you have a much more robust user interface,

26
00:01:20.605 --> 00:01:25.132
but you can customize the behavior of the print device to a much better degree.

27
00:01:25.132 --> 00:01:29.738
Now, whether you have to go to vendor's website and download their driver,

28
00:01:29.738 --> 00:01:34.550
or just let Windows give you one, it may be a bit of trial and error.

29
00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:39.048
Some vendors will make sure that Microsoft always has the latest and

30
00:01:39.048 --> 00:01:41.751
greatest copies of their model-specific drivers.

31
00:01:41.751 --> 00:01:45.942
In that case, you can just let plug and play and Windows Update work their magic,

32
00:01:45.942 --> 00:01:48.885
but if you are seeing class drivers come from Windows

33
00:01:48.885 --> 00:01:50.739
and you want more functionality,

34
00:01:50.739 --> 00:01:58.000
you'll need to manually intervene and download the current drivers from the vendor's website.
