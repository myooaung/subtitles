1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,222
This is where we get our user profiles,

2
00:00:04,222 --> 00:00:07,081
and I'm holding down my control key while I'm mouse

3
00:00:07,081 --> 00:00:08,753
rolling to get bigger icons here.

4
00:00:08,753 --> 00:00:12,011
Each user of a system will get his or her own folder.

5
00:00:12,011 --> 00:00:15,299
I'm logged on as Tim, so I'm going to go in the Tim folder.

6
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:16,226
By default,

7
00:00:16,226 --> 00:00:19,933
only that user has permission and administrators have

8
00:00:19,933 --> 00:00:21,702
permissions to the users folder.

9
00:00:21,702 --> 00:00:25,511
You can always customize permissions, but that goes beyond our scope.

10
00:00:25,511 --> 00:00:28,607
The idea here is that my personal settings here,

11
00:00:28,607 --> 00:00:30,454
my preferences, my desktop wallpaper,

12
00:00:30,454 --> 00:00:33,929
any custom sounds I've attached will show up here.

13
00:00:33,929 --> 00:00:38,009
Certainly, my documents show up here, our searches get saved here,

14
00:00:38,009 --> 00:00:40,306
my Start menu shortcuts, and of course,

15
00:00:40,306 --> 00:00:44,108
you can add whatever you want yourself to your home folder.

16
00:00:44,108 --> 00:00:47,777
Down below, we see a bunch of things called ntuser.

17
00:00:47,777 --> 00:00:50,350
These deal with what's called the Windows Registry that

18
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:52,330
we'll learn more about in a little bit.

19
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:56,962
But for now, just suffice it to say that each user gets their own profile folder.

20
00:00:56,962 --> 00:00:59,331
If multiple users are sharing a computer,

21
00:00:59,331 --> 00:01:02,459
then they will not be able to access each other's folder

22
00:01:02,459 --> 00:01:05,268
without an administrator granting special permissions and

23
00:01:05,268 --> 00:01:06,611
that's to preserve privacy.

24
00:01:06,611 --> 00:01:09,447
Note also that in a network environment where users

25
00:01:09,447 --> 00:01:11,062
go from computer to computer,

26
00:01:11,062 --> 00:01:14,719
I've found that's not as common nowadays as it used to be.

27
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:18,711
You can have your profiles also copied up to a network folder

28
00:01:18,711 --> 00:01:22,537
location and they will be roamed with the user.

29
00:01:22,537 --> 00:01:25,427
So if you log onto another computer at your business campus,

30
00:01:25,427 --> 00:01:29,407
you'll download your settings from the server and they will be

31
00:01:29,407 --> 00:01:32,821
populated in your C Users profile subfolder.

32
00:01:32,821 --> 00:01:36,950
The final thing I want to mention here is how does Windows get the defaults,

33
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:40,662
like if I create a new user account now and log on as that person,

34
00:01:40,662 --> 00:01:43,366
I'm going to see a default environment.

35
00:01:43,366 --> 00:01:47,406
Well what happens is we have a special folder called default user and

36
00:01:47,406 --> 00:01:50,456
notice that because I'm logged on as an ordinary user,

37
00:01:50,456 --> 00:01:52,849
I get that access is denied message.

38
00:01:52,849 --> 00:01:56,381
The default profile is the template that defines the

39
00:01:56,381 --> 00:01:58,658
starting environment for all users.

40
00:01:58,658 --> 00:02:02,700
Now that's useful for IT administrators because for businesses that

41
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,935
have policies where users need to see say the corporate desktop and

42
00:02:06,935 --> 00:02:08,584
have their environment standardized,

43
00:02:08,584 --> 00:02:12,093
then what the administrators will do is customize the

44
00:02:12,093 --> 00:02:20,000
default profile and then any new user will pick up a copy of all of those settings by default.
