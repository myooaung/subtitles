00:00:00.323 --> 00:00:02.695
For the last demo of this course,

2
00:00:02.695 --> 00:00:08.836
I want to give you some tips and tricks for navigating the Pluralsight site.

3
00:00:08.836 --> 00:00:11.588
Notice that I am on a full-fidelity computer here,

4
00:00:11.588 --> 00:00:14.137
not using one of the Pluralsight mobile applications.

5
00:00:14.137 --> 00:00:18.125
I would recommend you use the full fidelity site in order to get

6
00:00:18.125 --> 00:00:21.309
access to all the goodies that I'm about to show you.

7
00:00:21.309 --> 00:00:25.172
So let's say, for instance, you're interested in CompTIA A+.

8
00:00:25.172 --> 00:00:29.825
I'm just picking on this, because I know it's a very popular learning track.

9
00:00:29.825 --> 00:00:32.320
The fact that I taught it is significant to me,

10
00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.499
but it's probably not significant to other people.

11
00:00:34.499 --> 00:00:37.518
But you'll notice here that when we you do a search,

12
00:00:37.518 --> 00:00:41.675
we have All results, and then we can filter the view on just Courses,

13
00:00:41.675 --> 00:00:44.498
and then we can filter on Paths.

14
00:00:44.498 --> 00:00:48.828
The MTA exam is just a single exam, so there's not a path for it,

15
00:00:48.828 --> 00:00:53.035
but a more comprehensive certification like CompTIA A+ that

16
00:00:53.035 --> 00:00:55.751
actually requires you to take two exams,

17
00:00:55.751 --> 00:00:59.125
we actually have a learning path designed for it.

18
00:00:59.125 --> 00:01:01.905
And the path, if you're an enterprise customer,

19
00:01:01.905 --> 00:01:03.378
has some additional goodies,

20
00:01:03.378 --> 00:01:07.261
like being able to access the Transcender practice exams,

21
00:01:07.261 --> 00:01:10.965
and also to take advantage of mentoring services.

22
00:01:10.965 --> 00:01:15.021
Let me just dip into hardware for CompTIA A+.

23
00:01:15.021 --> 00:01:16.620
This is a specific course.

24
00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.511
A common question I receive from students is how do I

25
00:01:20.511 --> 00:01:22.989
get access to the exercise files?

26
00:01:22.989 --> 00:01:26.124
Well, in the web player, let me scroll down a little bit,

27
00:01:26.124 --> 00:01:30.461
instead of the Table of contents, you can come on over to Exercise files,

28
00:01:30.461 --> 00:01:35.375
and for this course there will be a single Download exercise files link.

29
00:01:35.375 --> 00:01:39.821
What that is is a zip file that contains a couple different things.

30
00:01:39.821 --> 00:01:43.613
Now this is for my A+ hardware course that has 15 modules.

31
00:01:43.613 --> 00:01:46.547
The MTA course that you're finishing has 20 modules,

32
00:01:46.547 --> 00:01:51.389
so you'll have 20 PDFs that reference my slide decks from each module,

33
00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:54.382
and you'll also have an exercise files folder.

34
00:01:54.382 --> 00:01:59.198
Normally, but not always, they contain a single file called demos.

35
00:01:59.198 --> 00:02:01.817
txt, and what I do with my demos.

36
00:02:01.817 --> 00:02:05.378
txt file is I put hyperlinks that reference everything I

37
00:02:05.378 --> 00:02:08.596
discuss and teach in that particular module.

38
00:02:08.596 --> 00:02:12.237
So this saves you from having to worry about taking notes.

39
00:02:12.237 --> 00:02:16.365
That having been said, notes are absolutely available in our courses.

40
00:02:16.365 --> 00:02:19.536
You've probably noticed, if you go over to Table of contents,

41
00:02:19.536 --> 00:02:23.402
and you fire up a video, let me pause the playback here,

42
00:02:23.402 --> 00:02:26.102
we can come over to the right-hand side,

43
00:02:26.102 --> 00:02:27.835
and there's a Notes area.

44
00:02:27.835 --> 00:02:31.243
Add your note, and this could be supplemental info,

45
00:02:31.243 --> 00:02:35.908
good to know information, make sure to study this subject particularly hard.

46
00:02:35.908 --> 00:02:40.799
You can make those notes, and each time you press Enter it's a save operation.

47
00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:44.196
Final thing I want to show you here is the Discussion.

48
00:02:44.196 --> 00:02:48.690
You can communicate with me at any time via email or through my Twitter,

49
00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:49.004
TechTrainerTim.

50
00:02:49.004 --> 00:02:52.460
I give you my email at the end of this module,

51
00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.239
but there's the Discussion tab as well.

52
00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.867
I don't remember what we use for our identity,

53
00:02:56.867 --> 00:03:01.203
I think it's discuss based on this icon that's showing up on the screen,

54
00:03:01.203 --> 00:03:04.758
but you create a free discuss account, if you don't already have one,

55
00:03:04.758 --> 00:03:06.921
and you can leave questions, comments, concerns,

56
00:03:06.921 --> 00:03:07.919
and curiosities.

57
00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:12.755
Generally, I have so many courses, I've taught maybe 50 or more courses,

58
00:03:12.755 --> 00:03:15.419
so it's difficult for me to monitor those myself,

59
00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:17.592
so honestly the discussion is fine,

60
00:03:17.592 --> 00:03:20.176
but you might want to send me an email instead.

61
00:03:20.176 --> 00:03:22.502
This is my personal email that you see up here.

62
00:03:22.502 --> 00:03:26.475
I'm fine with you having it, though, timothywarner316@gmail.

63
00:03:26.475 --> 00:03:26.972
com.

64
00:03:26.972 --> 00:03:29.950
My work email is timothy-warner@Pluralsight.

65
00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.000
com. I'm happy to make your acquaintance.
