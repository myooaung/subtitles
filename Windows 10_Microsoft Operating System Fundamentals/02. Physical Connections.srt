00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,227
First we'll examine network connectivity options in Windows 10.

2
00:00:06,227 --> 00:00:07,649
Before I do the demo,

3
00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:12,620
I wanted to go through a user interface tour to show you some of the major

4
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:15,901
touch points in configuring network connectivity in Windows 10.

5
00:00:15,901 --> 00:00:20,883
One option is to click the appropriate network icon in the notification area.

6
00:00:20,883 --> 00:00:24,808
What you see here is the icon that Microsoft uses

7
00:00:24,808 --> 00:00:26,797
for a wired ethernet connection.

8
00:00:26,797 --> 00:00:30,566
There's also a similar one that looks like Wi-Fi

9
00:00:30,566 --> 00:00:32,660
radio waves for Wi-Fi connections.

10
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:35,921
So if you click the ethernet or Wi-Fi link,

11
00:00:35,921 --> 00:00:38,756
you'll get a notification pop-up, like you see here,

12
00:00:38,756 --> 00:00:42,448
that gives you a list of available networks that you're either connected to,

13
00:00:42,448 --> 00:00:45,574
or can connect to, in the case of Wi-Fi.

14
00:00:45,574 --> 00:00:50,018
That's one way to get to your physical network connectivity in Windows 10.

15
00:00:50,018 --> 00:00:52,653
If you need to do some more profound configuration,

16
00:00:52,653 --> 00:00:56,437
no surprise, we can go to the Windows 10 Settings application.

17
00:00:56,437 --> 00:00:56,749
Specifically,

18
00:00:56,749 --> 00:01:00,512
under Network and Internet we have Status that gives you just a

19
00:01:00,512 --> 00:01:03,418
general run of what your current network connection is.

20
00:01:03,418 --> 00:01:06,322
Now you'll see below Status there's an Ethernet entry.

21
00:01:06,322 --> 00:01:09,954
Some other entries may show up in this list if you have

22
00:01:09,954 --> 00:01:11,720
other physical network connectivity means,

23
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,107
namely,

24
00:01:12,107 --> 00:01:16,899
if you have a Wi-Fi adapter in your computer you'll have an entry

25
00:01:16,899 --> 00:01:19,329
in this settings list for Wi-Fi connections.

26
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:22,676
You should see in the right side of this page several features that

27
00:01:22,676 --> 00:01:25,505
by now you should have good familiarity with,

28
00:01:25,505 --> 00:01:28,075
particularly the HomeGroup and Windows Firewall.

29
00:01:28,075 --> 00:01:30,522
VPN, or virtual private network,

30
00:01:30,522 --> 00:01:34,531
refers to creating a secure connection over the public internet,

31
00:01:34,531 --> 00:01:36,205
which is anything but secure,

32
00:01:36,205 --> 00:01:40,306
such that you can work as if you are local to your business,

33
00:01:40,306 --> 00:01:42,888
but you may be in a remote location, home,

34
00:01:42,888 --> 00:01:46,152
hotel, remote office, whatever the case may be.

35
00:01:46,152 --> 00:01:49,944
The VPN connections, or as I sometimes call them,

36
00:01:49,944 --> 00:01:53,346
connectoids, are stored and configured under this setting.

37
00:01:53,346 --> 00:01:56,413
Because I've been with Windows since the very beginning,

38
00:01:56,413 --> 00:01:58,609
I reflexively type ncpa.

39
00:01:58,609 --> 00:02:03,676
cpl to open the Network Connections window that you see in the background.

40
00:02:03,676 --> 00:02:06,379
This is going to have an icon that represents every

41
00:02:06,379 --> 00:02:10,122
physical connection you have, in some case,

42
00:02:10,122 --> 00:02:10,900
virtual network connections.

43
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,455
What do I mean by that?

44
00:02:12,455 --> 00:02:15,677
Well, the text is probably too small for you to see on your screen,

45
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:19,126
but there's an entry called vEthernet Default Switch.

46
00:02:19,126 --> 00:02:23,374
That is a virtual network interface that is managed by Hyper-V.

47
00:02:23,374 --> 00:02:27,684
The other three entries are, in fact, physical cards I have on my system.

48
00:02:27,684 --> 00:02:29,368
You can rename those connections.

49
00:02:29,368 --> 00:02:32,817
I have two connections on this machine that I'm using,

50
00:02:32,817 --> 00:02:35,676
one for internal connectivity and one for external.

51
00:02:35,676 --> 00:02:38,286
When you look at the properties of an Ethernet connection,

52
00:02:38,286 --> 00:02:39,474
you have, well, the property sheet.

53
00:02:39,474 --> 00:02:42,246
I'm going to go through this in more detail in the demo,

54
00:02:42,246 --> 00:02:44,804
but if you're not familiar with this workflow then

55
00:02:44,804 --> 00:02:46,861
you've got some remediation to do,

56
00:02:46,861 --> 00:02:51,505
because for our purposes here we have to assume a baseline

57
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:53,946
familiarity with Ethernet and TCP/IP.

58
00:02:53,946 --> 00:02:54,480
As usual,

59
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,153
at the end of this module I'll give you some

60
00:02:57,153 --> 00:03:05,000
Pluralsight course links if you do realize, hey, I need some more general purpose grounding in networking.
