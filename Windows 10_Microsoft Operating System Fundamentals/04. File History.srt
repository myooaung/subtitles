1
00:00:00,846 --> 00:00:04,393
File History.

2
00:00:04,393 --> 00:00:07,817
Now the first thing I want you to know about the Windows 10

3
00:00:07,817 --> 00:00:11,343
File History feature is that it's intended by Microsoft as a

4
00:00:11,343 --> 00:00:12,773
replacement for Windows Backup.

5
00:00:12,773 --> 00:00:16,604
Both Windows Client and Windows Server have shipped with built-in

6
00:00:16,604 --> 00:00:19,533
backup utilities since the beginning of Windows,

7
00:00:19,533 --> 00:00:24,787
but now that we're in Windows 10 land, and cloud storage is so ubiquitous,

8
00:00:24,787 --> 00:00:27,053
we have alternatives for traditional backup.

9
00:00:27,053 --> 00:00:29,354
Now that, quite honestly, what I just said,

10
00:00:29,354 --> 00:00:33,338
don't put much stock in that, because if you've done work with cloud storage,

11
00:00:33,338 --> 00:00:36,687
you know that a cloud storage provider's aim is to

12
00:00:36,687 --> 00:00:39,011
provide high availability for your data,

13
00:00:39,011 --> 00:00:40,119
and not recoverability.

14
00:00:40,119 --> 00:00:44,091
Please don't lull yourself into a false sense of security thinking,

15
00:00:44,091 --> 00:00:46,805
oh, well my data is automatically backed up.

16
00:00:46,805 --> 00:00:49,581
You want to be double and triple checking that to

17
00:00:49,581 --> 00:00:51,524
make sure that that is the case.

18
00:00:51,524 --> 00:00:54,362
If you don't have Windows Backup set up on a schedule,

19
00:00:54,362 --> 00:00:56,503
then you're not backing up your system.

20
00:00:56,503 --> 00:00:59,237
File History is analogous to Apple Time Machine.

21
00:00:59,237 --> 00:01:04,180
If you use Mac OS, it's a way to create a data repository,

22
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:07,403
normally an external drive, a plugin USB drive,

23
00:01:07,403 --> 00:01:09,668
and then automatically over time Windows,

24
00:01:09,668 --> 00:01:12,485
or Apple in the case of Time Machine,

25
00:01:12,485 --> 00:01:17,736
will target your user profile folders and just automatically back up

26
00:01:17,736 --> 00:01:20,898
your files periodically to that external storage.

27
00:01:20,898 --> 00:01:24,323
And that means if you make deletions in your profile folders,

28
00:01:24,323 --> 00:01:27,154
if you clear out your Downloads folder, for instance,

29
00:01:27,154 --> 00:01:28,355
and then realize hours,

30
00:01:28,355 --> 00:01:31,705
days or weeks later that you needed a file that was in there,

31
00:01:31,705 --> 00:01:33,210
you do have a fallback mechanism,

32
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:37,095
and you should be able to pluck the file from your File History archive.

33
00:01:37,095 --> 00:01:39,615
It's actually a really good product, however,

34
00:01:39,615 --> 00:01:42,956
as of this recording in January 2018,

35
00:01:42,956 --> 00:01:47,541
the status of File History is still a little shaky.

36
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:48,442
Over 2017,

37
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:53,141
Microsoft for a period of time actually marked File History for deprecation.

38
00:01:53,141 --> 00:01:57,284
Deprecation means that Microsoft isn't formally developing the product anymore,

39
00:01:57,284 --> 00:01:59,824
and it's subject to complete removal in a future

40
00:01:59,824 --> 00:02:01,431
version of the operating system.

41
00:02:01,431 --> 00:02:05,086
Now I think Microsoft got quite a bit of blowback from

42
00:02:05,086 --> 00:02:07,193
customers who rely upon File History,

43
00:02:07,193 --> 00:02:11,587
and it's still with us as of the Fall 2017 creators update,

44
00:02:11,587 --> 00:02:13,779
but I just wanted to make you aware of that,

45
00:02:13,779 --> 00:02:16,121
and to stay on the forefront of that news.

46
00:02:16,121 --> 00:02:17,678
If it does become deprecated,

47
00:02:17,678 --> 00:02:23,302
you'll have to look for another automatic file backup solution for your system.

48
00:02:23,302 --> 00:02:25,569
What the conventional wisdom is,

49
00:02:25,569 --> 00:02:29,691
the reason why Microsoft did mark File History as being deprecated,

50
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:33,409
at least for a time, until mysteriously suddenly bringing it back,

51
00:02:33,409 --> 00:02:37,839
is that the notion is Microsoft wants to roll File

52
00:02:37,839 --> 00:02:39,839
History capabilities into OneDrive.

53
00:02:39,839 --> 00:02:42,981
That hasn't happened yet, though, so again,

54
00:02:42,981 --> 00:02:44,777
as of early 2018,

55
00:02:44,777 --> 00:02:49,517
File History certainly has a good place in the Windows 10 users toolbox.

56
00:02:49,517 --> 00:02:52,495
OneDrive, I want to be really clear about this as well,

57
00:02:52,495 --> 00:02:56,092
is for file synchronization, and not file backup right now.

58
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:56,499
In fact,

59
00:02:56,499 --> 00:02:59,147
a little bit later in this module we're going to look at how

60
00:02:59,147 --> 00:03:01,397
to retrieve previous versions of a file,

61
00:03:01,397 --> 00:03:04,619
or how to retrieve a file from the Recycle Bin,

62
00:03:04,619 --> 00:03:13,000
but there's no backup that happens in OneDrive. If you delete a file and then delete it from the Recycle Bin, it's gone forever,
