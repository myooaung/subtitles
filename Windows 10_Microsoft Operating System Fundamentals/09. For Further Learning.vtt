For further learning in the Pluralsight library,

2
00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:09.283
we first have Glenn and Mark's 70-697 course: Configure Networking.

3
00:00:09.283 --> 00:00:13.798
There's great content here on Ethernet and TCP/IP in a Windows 10 context,

4
00:00:13.798 --> 00:00:17.504
and they're able to devote an entire course to this subject matter,

5
00:00:17.504 --> 00:00:19.684
and so it's very worth your time.

6
00:00:19.684 --> 00:00:23.423
My own course, Networking for CompTIA A+ would be a good idea.

7
00:00:23.423 --> 00:00:27.044
This is vendor neutral grounding, so I'm looking at Windows,

8
00:00:27.044 --> 00:00:29.106
Mac OS, and Linux environments.

9
00:00:29.106 --> 00:00:32.719
I'd also have you check out my colleague Ross Bagurdes and I,

10
00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:36.210
we did a learning track on CompTIA Network+,

11
00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.955
that's vendor neutral networking,

12
00:00:37.955 --> 00:00:47.000
so actually there's quite a bit of networking in both the CompTIA A+ and the Network+ that is good remedial information for you.
