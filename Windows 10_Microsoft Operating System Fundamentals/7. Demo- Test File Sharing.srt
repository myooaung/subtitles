1
00:00:01,826 --> 00:00:06,626
So let's click OK here and Close and come back to our Windows 10 workstation.

2
00:00:06,626 --> 00:00:10,867
I'm going to log on as someone who I know is only a member of domain users.

3
00:00:10,867 --> 00:00:16,900
So let me open up the Start menu, come down to my user control, and do Sign out.

4
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:19,917
And I'm going to sign in as Liz.

5
00:00:19,917 --> 00:00:23,586
I'm going to choose Other user, Liz, authenticate as her,

6
00:00:23,586 --> 00:00:27,018
get her desktop, and we can browse to the server.

7
00:00:27,018 --> 00:00:28,326
The server name is dc1.

8
00:00:28,326 --> 00:00:31,204
There's plenty of ways that we can get to that server.

9
00:00:31,204 --> 00:00:34,876
One direct way that you'll use as a systems administrator all

10
00:00:34,876 --> 00:00:37,678
the time is universal naming convention,

11
00:00:37,678 --> 00:00:39,812
backslash, backslash, server name.

12
00:00:39,812 --> 00:00:44,284
That'll make a network connection across the domain to that controller.

13
00:00:44,284 --> 00:00:46,228
So here we have the reports folder.

14
00:00:46,228 --> 00:00:47,339
In a previous module,

15
00:00:47,339 --> 00:00:51,845
I showed you that you can map a network drive by adding this shared

16
00:00:51,845 --> 00:00:55,331
folder as a local or logical drive letter on this system,

17
00:00:55,331 --> 00:00:58,488
but for now, I'm just going to browse into the folder.

18
00:00:58,488 --> 00:01:00,551
And let's open up a DOC file,

19
00:01:00,551 --> 00:01:05,859
and I'll choose More apps and choose to open it up in WordPad.

20
00:01:05,859 --> 00:01:08,867
I don't have the Office Suite installed for this user.

21
00:01:08,867 --> 00:01:11,814
Yikes, looks like we have some encoding problems.

22
00:01:11,814 --> 00:01:13,772
Never mind the man behind the curtain.

23
00:01:13,772 --> 00:01:17,157
What I'm trying to do is test the limits of Liz's permissions.

24
00:01:17,157 --> 00:01:21,154
So what we're going to do is choose a part of the document,

25
00:01:21,154 --> 00:01:25,651
randomly, it doesn't matter, delete it, and then see if we can make the change.

26
00:01:25,651 --> 00:01:26,194
Now, actually,

27
00:01:26,194 --> 00:01:28,603
let's do one more sanity check before we do that

28
00:01:28,603 --> 00:01:30,515
because if we come back to the server,

29
00:01:30,515 --> 00:01:33,039
look at the properties of the folder again,

30
00:01:33,039 --> 00:01:36,474
remember right-click, Properties, go to Security.

31
00:01:36,474 --> 00:01:40,386
We want to be absolutely sure that domain users only have read.

32
00:01:40,386 --> 00:01:43,389
Now if you were, rewind your video and check it again.

33
00:01:43,389 --> 00:01:46,072
You might notice that originally, I cut them down to read,

34
00:01:46,072 --> 00:01:48,018
but I still had write enabled.

35
00:01:48,018 --> 00:01:52,063
This is the view list of the access control list.

36
00:01:52,063 --> 00:01:54,683
We want to go to Edit to actually make changes.

37
00:01:54,683 --> 00:01:56,496
And if you scroll through the list here,

38
00:01:56,496 --> 00:01:59,833
it's very easy if you want to just give read access,

39
00:01:59,833 --> 00:02:02,022
to leave that write enabled.

40
00:02:02,022 --> 00:02:07,337
So I actually deselected that and saved that change and then OK'd out.

41
00:02:07,337 --> 00:02:09,915
Now behind the scenes where you don't see where I

42
00:02:09,915 --> 00:02:11,700
stopped the recording and fixed things,

43
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:15,509
I had to log Liz Noto off and log her back on.

44
00:02:15,509 --> 00:02:18,382
That's an important point for you to remember in the field.

45
00:02:18,382 --> 00:02:20,568
When you make changes to access control lists,

46
00:02:20,568 --> 00:02:23,198
the user will have to refresh his or her token.

47
00:02:23,198 --> 00:02:27,206
They don't have to restart, but they have to log off and log back on again.

48
00:02:27,206 --> 00:02:31,164
So after I made that change and after I logged Liz back on,

49
00:02:31,164 --> 00:02:34,572
reconnected to the reports folder, opened up this file,

50
00:02:34,572 --> 00:02:40,105
I'm going to make a change, click Save, and we see what we should see,

51
00:02:40,105 --> 00:02:41,488
an access denied message.

52
00:02:41,488 --> 00:02:45,031
So I want to finish this demo by again coming back to the

53
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:46,885
shared folder properties Security tab.

54
00:02:46,885 --> 00:02:51,236
We go to Edit to make changes to the existing DACL.

55
00:02:51,236 --> 00:02:56,795
If we go to Advanced, this unlocks a bigger interface where we can see four tabs,

56
00:02:56,795 --> 00:02:59,644
Permissions, Share, Auditing, and Effective Access.

57
00:02:59,644 --> 00:03:02,795
Now there's a lot more here than we have time to go over.

58
00:03:02,795 --> 00:03:04,593
If you're having problems with inheritance,

59
00:03:04,593 --> 00:03:07,416
you can come to, say, the subfolder level,

60
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:09,184
open this advanced view,

61
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:14,652
and you can see explicitly which security principles have been given which

62
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:18,169
access level and where the inheritance has taken place.

63
00:03:18,169 --> 00:03:19,614
You see what I mean?

64
00:03:19,614 --> 00:03:22,215
Now because I made changes to the domain users,

65
00:03:22,215 --> 00:03:24,585
notice that it says Inherited from None,

66
00:03:24,585 --> 00:03:28,395
because I made an override of that permissions inheritance.

67
00:03:28,395 --> 00:03:33,503
This SYSTEM, trainer, and administrator's identities I did not add.

68
00:03:33,503 --> 00:03:36,747
Those were all inherited from the parent object.

69
00:03:36,747 --> 00:03:38,952
And if we look at the path here,

70
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:43,378
the parent object of reports is going to be my desktop folder,

71
00:03:43,378 --> 00:03:44,877
which is C:\\Users\trainer\Desktop.

72
00:03:44,877 --> 00:03:48,311
Ultimately, it all comes to the root of the volume,

73
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:52,609
which is drive C, so that's where you can make adjustments,

74
00:03:52,609 --> 00:03:54,697
and disable inheritance, and replace.

75
00:03:54,697 --> 00:03:57,176
Those are important troubleshooting steps.

76
00:03:57,176 --> 00:04:01,454
But what I want to do is take us over to Effective Access because this is

77
00:04:01,454 --> 00:04:05,079
where you can test what level of access a user has.

78
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:07,705
And what you do is you select a user.

79
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:08,872
I'll select Liz Noto.

80
00:04:08,872 --> 00:04:11,797
I'll check her name to resolve it, bring it in.

81
00:04:11,797 --> 00:04:14,447
To include additional group memberships besides the

82
00:04:14,447 --> 00:04:17,519
one that she's already a member of, you can do that.

83
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,971
I'm not going to do that.

84
00:04:18,971 --> 00:04:22,151
You can actually add permissions to computers as well,

85
00:04:22,151 --> 00:04:25,731
so you have the ability to look for her computer.

86
00:04:25,731 --> 00:04:28,260
I happen to know it's called ps1.

87
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,071
At least I think it's called ps1.

88
00:04:30,071 --> 00:04:33,416
Let me go to Object Types and make sure we're looking at computers.

89
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:34,181
Yes, we are.

90
00:04:34,181 --> 00:04:35,967
And we are looking at the domain.

91
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:39,107
Oh, it's not ps1; it's devbox; that's right.

92
00:04:39,107 --> 00:04:41,944
So let me check that name and resolve that.

93
00:04:41,944 --> 00:04:44,266
And then if we go to View effective access,

94
00:04:44,266 --> 00:04:47,230
it gives us a run of specifically what she has.

95
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:51,800
And in this case, it looks like any changes to effective access,

96
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,972
the full control, for instance,

97
00:04:53,972 --> 00:04:58,473
that comes from the shared folder is being limited by the NTFS file permissions.

98
00:04:58,473 --> 00:05:02,505
She is able to list the folder and read the data and the file attributes,

99
00:05:02,505 --> 00:05:03,964
but that's all.

100
00:05:03,964 --> 00:05:12,000
She's got explicit read permission. This is a very useful tool that you'll use all the time in practice.
