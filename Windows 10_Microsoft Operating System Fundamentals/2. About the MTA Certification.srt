00:00:00,689 --> 00:00:04,363
About the MTA certification.

2
00:00:04,363 --> 00:00:08,313
The Microsoft certification hierarchy functions like this.

3
00:00:08,313 --> 00:00:12,401
We have at the entry level the Microsoft Technology Associate,

4
00:00:12,401 --> 00:00:13,627
or MTA, credential.

5
00:00:13,627 --> 00:00:15,986
What the hallmark of this credential is,

6
00:00:15,986 --> 00:00:19,656
is that no prior experience in information technology is required,

7
00:00:19,656 --> 00:00:24,862
so it's a perfect starter certification for those who want to get into IT,

8
00:00:24,862 --> 00:00:26,651
either right out of school,

9
00:00:26,651 --> 00:00:29,804
or perhaps you're what's called a career changer who is coming

10
00:00:29,804 --> 00:00:32,809
into information technology from another field.

11
00:00:32,809 --> 00:00:36,705
There are a number of MTA certifications that each focus on

12
00:00:36,705 --> 00:00:40,341
different elementary aspects of IT: networking,

13
00:00:40,341 --> 00:00:42,716
cloud computing, databases, development,

14
00:00:42,716 --> 00:00:46,362
and this one, of course, is operating system fundamentals.

15
00:00:46,362 --> 00:00:50,543
The mid tier is what's called the Microsoft Certified Solutions Associate.

16
00:00:50,543 --> 00:00:56,075
I'm speaking most particularly of the IT pro or the IT

17
00:00:56,075 --> 00:00:59,158
operations job role as opposed to the developer.

18
00:00:59,158 --> 00:01:02,211
There are a whole suite of developer certifications that

19
00:01:02,211 --> 00:01:04,490
we won't talk about in this module.

20
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:09,537
The MCSA is a really nice mid-tier credential that demonstrates your

21
00:01:09,537 --> 00:01:13,919
competency with a particular Microsoft product or product family.

22
00:01:13,919 --> 00:01:14,778
For instance,

23
00:01:14,778 --> 00:01:18,642
Windows Server is a very popular candidate for MCSA

24
00:01:18,642 --> 00:01:22,420
certifications for those who may have begun with an MTA.

25
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:24,606
The top tier credential is the MCSE.

26
00:01:24,606 --> 00:01:28,556
This credential has been around as long as I have been in IT.

27
00:01:28,556 --> 00:01:30,347
I became an MCSE in 1998,

28
00:01:30,347 --> 00:01:37,257
but in those days MCSE stood for Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer.

29
00:01:37,257 --> 00:01:40,131
Those four letters carry quite a bit of industry clout,

30
00:01:40,131 --> 00:01:42,680
so they're retained even today in 2018,

31
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:47,329
but notice that it's now Solutions Expert instead of Systems Engineer.

32
00:01:47,329 --> 00:01:48,140
Once again,

33
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:51,385
you can attain your MCSA in several different

34
00:01:51,385 --> 00:01:54,969
Microsoft enterprise server products, like cloud platform,

35
00:01:54,969 --> 00:01:58,517
Windows Server, and SharePoint Server.

36
00:01:58,517 --> 00:02:02,837
Some analogous certifications to the MTA would be,

37
00:02:02,837 --> 00:02:05,645
for instance, certifications by CompTIA.

38
00:02:05,645 --> 00:02:08,887
CompTIA Is a vendor-neutral industry consortium.

39
00:02:08,887 --> 00:02:10,334
Microsoft belongs to CompTIA,

40
00:02:10,334 --> 00:02:14,771
as do most of the other major vendors in this space.

41
00:02:14,771 --> 00:02:18,930
The A+ deals with computer hardware of all types,

42
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,391
and also operating system support.

43
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:25,636
Network + is a vendor-neutral approach to Ethernet networking.

44
00:02:25,636 --> 00:02:29,562
Those two certifications taken together give you an incredibly

45
00:02:29,562 --> 00:02:33,833
well-rounded validation of entry-level IT skills.

46
00:02:33,833 --> 00:02:34,738
MTA, same thing,

47
00:02:34,738 --> 00:02:38,424
but of course the scope with the Microsoft MTA Operating System

48
00:02:38,424 --> 00:02:42,800
Essentials is the Windows 10 operating system in particular.

49
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,330
Another, I want to say competing,

50
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:47,181
but I don't really mean it in a competing sense,

51
00:02:47,181 --> 00:02:52,110
an analogous certification to the MTA would be the Cisco certification,

52
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:55,295
Cisco Certified Entry Networking Technician,

53
00:02:55,295 --> 00:02:56,569
or CCENT.

54
00:02:56,569 --> 00:03:00,384
Now, of course, the bent there is on Cisco routers and switches,

55
00:03:00,384 --> 00:03:03,574
but CCENT does its best to be vendor neutral,

56
00:03:03,574 --> 00:03:08,403
because really when we're talking about fundamentals of Ethernet and TCP/IP,

57
00:03:08,403 --> 00:03:11,897
those are absolutely cross-platform technologies.

58
00:03:11,897 --> 00:03:15,317
Okay, so you have the lay of the land, in general, high-level view.

59
00:03:15,317 --> 00:03:18,500
You have vendor-specific certifications like Microsoft,

60
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,983
Apple, and Cisco,

61
00:03:19,983 --> 00:03:24,273
and you have vendor-neutral certifications like CompTIA and ISC2.

62
00:03:24,273 --> 00:03:31,000
If you're thinking ISC what Tim? Check the exercise files, because I give you some supplemental links.
