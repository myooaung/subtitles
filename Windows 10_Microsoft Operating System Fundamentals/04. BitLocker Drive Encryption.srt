1
00:00:00,667 --> 00:00:04,048
BitLocker Drive Encryption.

2
00:00:04,048 --> 00:00:07,760
The BitLocker use case is simply this: A person steals the

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:11,553
hard drive from a workstation or server with the intention

4
00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:13,112
of accessing privileged data.

5
00:00:13,112 --> 00:00:15,219
You never want that to happen in business.

6
00:00:15,219 --> 00:00:18,506
Nowadays, employees walk around with company-issued laptops.

7
00:00:18,506 --> 00:00:21,763
Someone leaves theirs behind on a bus or on a train or

8
00:00:21,763 --> 00:00:23,731
in an airport and it gets stolen,

9
00:00:23,731 --> 00:00:26,615
what's going to happen when the person starts the computer?

10
00:00:26,615 --> 00:00:29,323
Well, if you have the drive, the C drive,

11
00:00:29,323 --> 00:00:32,711
locked with BitLocker, you'll need to provide some kind of authentication.

12
00:00:32,711 --> 00:00:34,763
And if you can't provide that authentication,

13
00:00:34,763 --> 00:00:36,586
you're not going to unlock the drive.

14
00:00:36,586 --> 00:00:37,670
It's as simple as that.

15
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:40,614
Even if you were to take the hard drive out of that computer,

16
00:00:40,614 --> 00:00:44,458
put it in, say, a USB enclosure, and attempt to mount it as an external drive,

17
00:00:44,458 --> 00:00:48,090
still, unless you have the proper unlock authentication key,

18
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:50,846
you're not going to get that data.

19
00:00:50,846 --> 00:00:55,110
It's a whole disk, BitLocker is a whole disk drive encryption technology.

20
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:56,597
Now options here, first of all,

21
00:00:56,597 --> 00:01:00,329
you're going to get the best mileage out of BitLocker if your system

22
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:03,635
motherboard has a little chip called a Trusted Platform Module,

23
00:01:03,635 --> 00:01:04,286
or TPM.

24
00:01:04,286 --> 00:01:06,943
So if you're shopping for a new laptop,

25
00:01:06,943 --> 00:01:09,957
make sure that that laptop supports TPM V1.

26
00:01:09,957 --> 00:01:11,087
2 or later.

27
00:01:11,087 --> 00:01:15,495
The importance of that is that that TPM allow you to do pre-boot integrity.

28
00:01:15,495 --> 00:01:20,124
This is Secure Boot where all of your boot files are digitally signed and

29
00:01:20,124 --> 00:01:23,620
verified and vetted against the Trusted Platform Module.

30
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:26,869
So if someone were to put a keylogger or try to install

31
00:01:26,869 --> 00:01:29,094
a boot sector virus on your system,

32
00:01:29,094 --> 00:01:31,566
that would violate the Secure Boot environment,

33
00:01:31,566 --> 00:01:32,846
and the system would not start up.

34
00:01:32,846 --> 00:01:33,760
You see what I mean?

35
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,639
That's good security.

36
00:01:34,639 --> 00:01:37,568
Another thing that TPM does is it stores the keys

37
00:01:37,568 --> 00:01:41,474
for BitLocker Drive Encryption, so if a disk is removed from the motherboard,

38
00:01:41,474 --> 00:01:44,616
it no longer has access to the TPM.

39
00:01:44,616 --> 00:01:45,935
It's not going to boot.

40
00:01:45,935 --> 00:01:48,464
Now if you're thinking, woah, well, what about a failsafe?

41
00:01:48,464 --> 00:01:52,661
What if the motherboard dies, and I need to take the disk to another computer?

42
00:01:52,661 --> 00:01:53,006
Well,

43
00:01:53,006 --> 00:01:57,197
you can add additional or alternate layers of authentication like a

44
00:01:57,197 --> 00:02:00,434
password or a personal identification number as well.

45
00:02:00,434 --> 00:02:05,331
You can even use a USB-based dongle as a substitute for the TPM.

46
00:02:05,331 --> 00:02:09,120
So as I said, other protections include a USB startup key,

47
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,517
a PIN, unlock password.

48
00:02:10,517 --> 00:02:13,870
BitLocker can be used to protect not only your system volume

49
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,987
or your OS volume or your boot volume,

50
00:02:15,987 --> 00:02:18,894
you can think of your C drive in all of those ways,

51
00:02:18,894 --> 00:02:20,213
but also your data volume.

52
00:02:20,213 --> 00:02:22,587
So you can fully protect your system this way.

53
00:02:22,587 --> 00:02:26,243
BitLocker To Go allows you to use BitLocker encryption on

54
00:02:26,243 --> 00:02:29,811
removable disks and USB flash media.

55
00:02:29,811 --> 00:02:32,518
Now we don't need to get really down in the weeds as far

56
00:02:32,518 --> 00:02:34,216
as how BitLocker works technically.

57
00:02:34,216 --> 00:02:38,063
You can learn that by searching the Pluralsight library.

58
00:02:38,063 --> 00:02:39,419
But for now, for our purposes,

59
00:02:39,419 --> 00:02:42,832
I want you to understand that we can manage BitLocker directly in

60
00:02:42,832 --> 00:02:45,695
Windows 10 through the graphical user interface,

61
00:02:45,695 --> 00:02:47,060
no surprise there.

62
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:50,095
From a systems administration Active Directory standpoint,

63
00:02:50,095 --> 00:02:53,888
there's Group Policy management, we can use good old PowerShell.

64
00:02:53,888 --> 00:02:58,348
There are two command line tools, manage-bde and repair-bde,

65
00:02:58,348 --> 00:03:00,336
that you can call from an elevated command prompt.

66
00:03:00,336 --> 00:03:02,581
And then we have something called MBAM.

67
00:03:02,581 --> 00:03:04,825
Now what the heck does MBAM mean?

68
00:03:04,825 --> 00:03:07,452
When I say that, it reminds me of the Flintstones.

69
00:03:07,452 --> 00:03:08,394
Remember them?

70
00:03:08,394 --> 00:03:08,866
Bamm-Bamm.

71
00:03:08,866 --> 00:03:12,164
MBAM stands for BitLocker Administration and Monitoring.

72
00:03:12,164 --> 00:03:15,615
Now this is a tool that's available as part of the

73
00:03:15,615 --> 00:03:17,949
Microsoft Desktop Optimization pack, or MDOP,

74
00:03:17,949 --> 00:03:18,376
M-D-O-P.

75
00:03:18,376 --> 00:03:21,448
Check the exercise files for info on that.

76
00:03:21,448 --> 00:03:24,573
It's not free; you have to be a Software Assurance

77
00:03:24,573 --> 00:03:26,018
license holder with Microsoft.

78
00:03:26,018 --> 00:03:30,561
There's a couple other ways to be legally qualified to get this tool.

79
00:03:30,561 --> 00:03:33,826
But this, if you're using BitLocker in business,

80
00:03:33,826 --> 00:03:37,524
is very, very useful, if not required.

81
00:03:37,524 --> 00:03:39,796
The MBAM console, as you see here, is web-based,

82
00:03:39,796 --> 00:03:42,825
so you can get to it theoretically from anywhere in

83
00:03:42,825 --> 00:03:45,475
your network or using a VPN remotely.

84
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:48,953
And this is going to solve problems like your employee has

85
00:03:48,953 --> 00:03:51,107
BitLocker set to boot with a startup password,

86
00:03:51,107 --> 00:03:55,379
and they can't for the life of themselves remember what the password is.

87
00:03:55,379 --> 00:03:59,537
Or they're using only TPM, and the motherboard on their system is fried,

88
00:03:59,537 --> 00:04:02,665
and you need to supply the drive recovery key,

89
00:04:02,665 --> 00:04:07,596
which is essentially the super-unlock password to get access to that disk.

90
00:04:07,596 --> 00:04:11,534
Well, MBAM allows you to support those drive recovery options,

91
00:04:11,534 --> 00:04:16,259
as well as manage the TPMs on enrolled workstations in your

92
00:04:16,259 --> 00:04:24,000
environment and servers on your environment. Super-useful tool for businesses that are using BitLocker.
