1
00:00:01,865 --> 00:00:05,684
Windows Defender SmartScreen.

2
00:00:05,684 --> 00:00:06,175
Specifically,

3
00:00:06,175 --> 00:00:11,140
Windows Defender is the anti-malware client that's built-in to Windows 10.

4
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:13,430
It's a very robust product now.

5
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:15,943
SmartScreen is a component of it.

6
00:00:15,943 --> 00:00:19,421
Specifically, the defender family in Windows 10 is called,

7
00:00:19,421 --> 00:00:21,944
well it's put under the parent application,

8
00:00:21,944 --> 00:00:25,479
Windows Defender Security Center, and what SmartScreen does,

9
00:00:25,479 --> 00:00:29,924
it's a live check against applications and files that you

10
00:00:29,924 --> 00:00:32,886
attempt to download from the internet through,

11
00:00:32,886 --> 00:00:37,158
say, Microsoft Edge, and compares those against known bad versions.

12
00:00:37,158 --> 00:00:41,624
So a SmartScreen is screening your file downloads and your

13
00:00:41,624 --> 00:00:44,365
application launches against its own database.

14
00:00:44,365 --> 00:00:47,594
So this is going to require an internet connection to work,

15
00:00:47,594 --> 00:00:50,591
obviously, and it's going to require that you turn this on,

16
00:00:50,591 --> 00:00:54,532
and that you're okay with your files, you download file attempts,

17
00:00:54,532 --> 00:00:57,862
and your application starts to be sent to Microsoft.

18
00:00:57,862 --> 00:01:02,302
What's sent is only a hash, not any more information than that.

19
00:01:02,302 --> 00:01:06,593
So maybe you're downloading WinZip, but you're not downloading it from winzip.

20
00:01:06,593 --> 00:01:10,742
com, which is the official company site that owns that product.

21
00:01:10,742 --> 00:01:13,762
It could be that you're downloading it from a rogue website that's

22
00:01:13,762 --> 00:01:17,547
modified the WinZip installer to contain malware.

23
00:01:17,547 --> 00:01:20,889
Well when you run a hashing algorithm, that is you apply,

24
00:01:20,889 --> 00:01:24,182
say, a file, a binary file like the WinZip installer,

25
00:01:24,182 --> 00:01:28,248
to an algorithm like MD5 it comes out with a certain result,

26
00:01:28,248 --> 00:01:31,147
a hash let's call it, an alpha numeric string.

27
00:01:31,147 --> 00:01:35,753
If you change one bit of that file and rerun the hash algorithm it's going

28
00:01:35,753 --> 00:01:39,430
to have a totally different hash value or digest value,

29
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:43,593
so these hash functions are useful to detect changes.

30
00:01:43,593 --> 00:01:46,699
What will happen is you go to download the rogue WinZip,

31
00:01:46,699 --> 00:01:50,887
SmartScreen Database Online knows what the correct hash value should be,

32
00:01:50,887 --> 00:01:53,396
if it differs you're going to get flagged and say,

33
00:01:53,396 --> 00:01:54,378
wait a minute now.

34
00:01:54,378 --> 00:01:56,586
This file does not match what it's supposed to.

35
00:01:56,586 --> 00:01:57,216
Once again,

36
00:01:57,216 --> 00:02:00,365
we have that issue of end-user training and helping them

37
00:02:00,365 --> 00:02:02,990
not be numb to these kind of responses,

38
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:07,019
and there's also additional tools in the Windows Defender family,

39
00:02:07,019 --> 00:02:11,681
particularly up in Office 365 where you can actually take

40
00:02:11,681 --> 00:02:14,823
auto-remediation steps when SmartScreen flags something as

41
00:02:14,823 --> 00:02:16,455
a possible security hazard,

42
00:02:16,455 --> 00:02:20,158
but for our purposes today in Windows 10 we have

43
00:02:20,158 --> 00:02:23,706
SmartScreen running in Edge to protect your device against

44
00:02:23,706 --> 00:02:26,165
malicious website visits and downloads.

45
00:02:26,165 --> 00:02:28,822
SmartScreen also runs behind the scenes in Windows Store

46
00:02:28,822 --> 00:02:30,979
to check content used by your app.

47
00:02:30,979 --> 00:02:34,574
So if you download or purchase a Windows Store app and it

48
00:02:34,574 --> 00:02:37,562
wants to go out onto the internet to fetch a file

49
00:02:37,562 --> 00:02:45,000
SmartScreen will capture that request, and once again, warn you if there's something that you might want to be concerned with.
