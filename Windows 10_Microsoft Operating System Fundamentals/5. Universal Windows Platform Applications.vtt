1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.893
So it was for those reasons and more that Microsoft decided

2
00:00:04.893 --> 00:00:08.027
to change its main application format.

3
00:00:08.027 --> 00:00:09.150
Instead of.

4
00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:10.833
exe we have.

5
00:00:10.833 --> 00:00:11.394
app.

6
00:00:11.394 --> 00:00:17.881
I want to turn our attention now to the Universal Windows Platform or UWP.

7
00:00:17.881 --> 00:00:19.681
First, a brief history lesson.

8
00:00:19.681 --> 00:00:23.882
In Windows 8 Microsoft gave us these new apps that ran in

9
00:00:23.882 --> 00:00:26.234
a full screen with no window chrome,

10
00:00:26.234 --> 00:00:29.401
and by window chrome I'm talking about the minimize,

11
00:00:29.401 --> 00:00:33.531
maximize, and close buttons or even menus or toolbar buttons.

12
00:00:33.531 --> 00:00:36.704
Very different and jarring interface for many.

13
00:00:36.704 --> 00:00:39.600
Did not go over in the public very well actually.

14
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.065
They were called metro apps for a while,

15
00:00:42.065 --> 00:00:44.447
they were called universal apps for a while.

16
00:00:44.447 --> 00:00:47.031
Now they're called UWP apps, at least for now.

17
00:00:47.031 --> 00:00:51.104
Some of the underlying ideas is that Microsoft wanted a

18
00:00:51.104 --> 00:00:55.565
universal platform for applications, not just apps that Microsoft develops,

19
00:00:55.565 --> 00:00:57.065
but third-party developers as well,

20
00:00:57.065 --> 00:01:01.051
such that if you fire up the same app on your PC,

21
00:01:01.051 --> 00:01:03.431
on you Xbox, on your phone,

22
00:01:03.431 --> 00:01:07.581
on your surface tablet you get the exact same

23
00:01:07.581 --> 00:01:09.632
interface with full inter-compatibility.

24
00:01:09.632 --> 00:01:13.427
Microsoft had a variant version of Windows 8 for a while called

25
00:01:13.427 --> 00:01:16.277
Windows RT that was optimized for tablets.

26
00:01:16.277 --> 00:01:19.306
That operating system is long gone now though.

27
00:01:19.306 --> 00:01:22.273
As I said, a lot of customer backlash to Windows 8.

28
00:01:22.273 --> 00:01:25.535
Losing the Start menu is probably number one.

29
00:01:25.535 --> 00:01:30.253
The confusion about universal or metro apps probably number two, but Windows 8.

30
00:01:30.253 --> 00:01:33.672
1 gave us a more consistent app store interface,

31
00:01:33.672 --> 00:01:36.149
as well as the ability to sideload apps.

32
00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:40.630
Sideload is kind of a slang term that refers to making these

33
00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.027
UWP apps visible in the Windows App Store,

34
00:01:44.027 --> 00:01:47.400
but only visible to you and/or those in your business,

35
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.074
you see?

36
00:01:48.074 --> 00:01:51.224
In the previous module I told you that the higher level,

37
00:01:51.224 --> 00:01:54.355
the business SKUs of Windows 10 allow you to do

38
00:01:54.355 --> 00:01:57.271
sideloading and have your own custom app store.

39
00:01:57.271 --> 00:02:01.673
That's important from a business perspective because you want to control

40
00:02:01.673 --> 00:02:05.819
even what UWP apps your users can install on their systems.

41
00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:09.451
Today on Windows 10 we, again, have the Windows App Store.

42
00:02:09.451 --> 00:02:12.369
The store has undergone several name changes as well,

43
00:02:12.369 --> 00:02:15.482
and these Windows Store Apps are called either that,

44
00:02:15.482 --> 00:02:19.587
Windows Store Apps or Trusted Windows Store Apps.

45
00:02:19.587 --> 00:02:24.448
Developers will call them UWP apps in general.

46
00:02:24.448 --> 00:02:26.212
Some elements of these UWP apps,

47
00:02:26.212 --> 00:02:31.148
what you're seeing now is a screenshot from a Windows 8 era metro style app,

48
00:02:31.148 --> 00:02:34.837
and this is the weather app obviously, and it's very jarring,

49
00:02:34.837 --> 00:02:35.813
as I said,

50
00:02:35.813 --> 00:02:38.146
to someone who's used to traditional apps because

51
00:02:38.146 --> 00:02:40.187
where do you get the close button?

52
00:02:40.187 --> 00:02:43.712
Where do you get back to your desktop?

53
00:02:43.712 --> 00:02:45.475
It's quite unintuitive, honestly.

54
00:02:45.475 --> 00:02:49.302
Now in Windows 10 these apps they have the same general feel.

55
00:02:49.302 --> 00:02:51.911
They're very graphically intensive in multimedia,

56
00:02:51.911 --> 00:02:55.968
but you'll notice that they can run in a window that has the minimize,

57
00:02:55.968 --> 00:02:57.579
maximize, and close button.

58
00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:00.302
There are additional user interface elements,

59
00:03:00.302 --> 00:03:02.740
the gear icon to get you into settings.

60
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.664
A search control in weather would be useful if you want to look up

61
00:03:06.664 --> 00:03:09.403
another ZIP code or city and look at its weather,

62
00:03:09.403 --> 00:03:13.835
so Microsoft is maintaining a lot of what makes the UWP apps cool,

63
00:03:13.835 --> 00:03:15.239
namely a live,

64
00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:18.221
immersive experience while also giving us the

65
00:03:18.221 --> 00:03:20.439
concession of a familiar user interface.

66
00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:24.623
We saw earlier in this training how you can customize the Windows 10 Start menu,

67
00:03:24.623 --> 00:03:28.288
and it's a hybrid menu where you can have your traditional desktop

68
00:03:28.288 --> 00:03:30.969
applications at the left in the normal display,

69
00:03:30.969 --> 00:03:33.999
and then at the right you have your UWP apps,

70
00:03:33.999 --> 00:03:36.313
and those are what are called live tiles.

71
00:03:36.313 --> 00:03:39.961
So if you have the weather app every time you open the Start menu you can

72
00:03:39.961 --> 00:03:43.481
see the weather snapshot for whatever your target city is.

73
00:03:43.481 --> 00:03:46.813
If you have the stock prices app in the Start menu

74
00:03:46.813 --> 00:03:50.336
you can easily glance it there, so it's meant to give you live,

75
00:03:50.336 --> 00:03:51.411
dynamic data as well.

76
00:03:51.411 --> 00:03:55.857
I want to say one more thing about UWP apps before we do our demo,

77
00:03:55.857 --> 00:03:59.420
and that is besides the universality of these apps,

78
00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.539
one other element that Microsoft puts into these is

79
00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:05.828
the idea of sandboxed security.

80
00:04:05.828 --> 00:04:09.192
Remember I told you that desktop apps generally don't have that.

81
00:04:09.192 --> 00:04:12.978
These trusted Windows apps are heavily constrained on your system.

82
00:04:12.978 --> 00:04:16.564
They're not allowed to go outside of their sandbox by default,

83
00:04:16.564 --> 00:04:20.895
and if they do request that access you have to explicitly allow it,

84
00:04:20.895 --> 00:04:21.561
you see?

85
00:04:21.561 --> 00:04:23.515
And then I guess the final thing, but wait,

86
00:04:23.515 --> 00:04:23.950
there's more,

87
00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:29.216
is that the way you develop or program these UWP apps is fundamentally

88
00:04:29.216 --> 00:04:32.074
different from how you do traditional desktop apps.

89
00:04:32.074 --> 00:04:33.101
In other words,

90
00:04:33.101 --> 00:04:36.453
you might have noticed that the interface almost looks like a web page,

91
00:04:36.453 --> 00:04:41.281
and as a matter of fact, you can build UWP apps with JavaScript.

92
00:04:41.281 --> 00:04:44.508
So if you're a web developer and you're accustomed to this kind of

93
00:04:44.508 --> 00:04:55.000
thing you don't have to necessarily learn C# and Win32 desktop app development in order to create these UWP apps.
