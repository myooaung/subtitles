00:00:01.168 --> 00:00:03.329
Local Storage.

2
00:00:03.329 --> 00:00:07.314
There's two chief distinctions, or ground-level distinctions,

3
00:00:07.314 --> 00:00:09.741
when it comes to fixed-disk storage.

4
00:00:09.741 --> 00:00:10.550
That is,

5
00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:13.827
the persistent storage that's permanently mounted inside

6
00:00:13.827 --> 00:00:19.454
your laptop or desktop PC chassis, or potentially your tablet device or phone.

7
00:00:19.454 --> 00:00:23.021
We have first the hard disk drive, also called HDD.

8
00:00:23.021 --> 00:00:26.696
Now the HDD has been around since the beginning of computing.

9
00:00:26.696 --> 00:00:32.391
This is a mechanical disk device, and as such, it's generally unreliable.

10
00:00:32.391 --> 00:00:35.440
You want to be careful after an HDD's been around

11
00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.182
more than say three/four years,

12
00:00:37.182 --> 00:00:42.146
and be a little suspect about its capacity to store data reliably.

13
00:00:42.146 --> 00:00:44.372
It always reminds me of the old jukeboxes.

14
00:00:44.372 --> 00:00:48.012
If you remember those, if you're old enough to remember the jukebox,

15
00:00:48.012 --> 00:00:49.958
where you had a stack of platters,

16
00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:54.174
and then you could press a button and then this mechanical apparition

17
00:00:54.174 --> 00:00:58.225
would retrieve the appropriate 45 or 33 and a third,

18
00:00:58.225 --> 00:01:02.228
or 78 rpm vinyl record, and then bring the needle over,

19
00:01:02.228 --> 00:01:05.809
and it was relatively clunky, but we had a good time.

20
00:01:05.809 --> 00:01:07.334
That's how HDDs work.

21
00:01:07.334 --> 00:01:10.385
They're slower, they're less expensive than the alternative.

22
00:01:10.385 --> 00:01:12.419
And what's the alternative, Tim?

23
00:01:12.419 --> 00:01:15.267
That would be solid-state disks, or SSDs.

24
00:01:15.267 --> 00:01:17.032
The advantages here are speed.

25
00:01:17.032 --> 00:01:18.796
We have no moving parts.

26
00:01:18.796 --> 00:01:20.765
We use flash memory technology,

27
00:01:20.765 --> 00:01:24.308
which is going to give you much faster performance.

28
00:01:24.308 --> 00:01:25.928
You have greater shock absorbency.

29
00:01:25.928 --> 00:01:30.858
If you drop an HDD on the ground and any of those platters go out of alignment,

30
00:01:30.858 --> 00:01:33.284
or if the read/write head goes out of alignment,

31
00:01:33.284 --> 00:01:34.395
you're in big trouble.

32
00:01:34.395 --> 00:01:38.171
SSD is much more friendly to those kind of insults.

33
00:01:38.171 --> 00:01:42.493
Now SSD storage, as you would imagine, is more expensive than HDD storage,

34
00:01:42.493 --> 00:01:47.130
but the prices have really come down significantly over the years.

35
00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.366
Now if there's an issue with SSD,

36
00:01:49.366 --> 00:01:54.064
it would be that the flash memory has a fixed number of read/write operations

37
00:01:54.064 --> 00:01:58.658
before you reach what's called the mean time before failure,

38
00:01:58.658 --> 00:01:59.720
or MTBF.

39
00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.146
That introduces the concept of disk maintenance,

40
00:02:02.146 --> 00:02:06.196
which is largely what we're discussing in this module.

41
00:02:06.196 --> 00:02:10.583
I want to buzz through some of the storage interfaces used with fixed disk,

42
00:02:10.583 --> 00:02:15.317
and potentially sometimes external disk storage that works with Windows 10.

43
00:02:15.317 --> 00:02:18.724
We have the Serial ATA standard, the cable looks like this.

44
00:02:18.724 --> 00:02:23.370
They're much better than the old IDE, integrated drive electronics,

45
00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.540
ribbon cables that we had back in the bad old days.

46
00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.068
Now this isn't a CompTIA A+ or hardware course,

47
00:02:29.068 --> 00:02:32.669
so I'm going to tread pretty quickly on this section.

48
00:02:32.669 --> 00:02:35.305
We have SCSI, Serial Attached SCSI,

49
00:02:35.305 --> 00:02:39.227
this form factor is normally used with server disk drives.

50
00:02:39.227 --> 00:02:40.869
Sometimes in Windows 10,

51
00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:45.407
you might have a high-performance workstation that requires the greater

52
00:02:45.407 --> 00:02:49.990
input/output operations that SAS and SCSI disks can give you.

53
00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:53.980
ISCSI is actually a network storage protocol that allows you to

54
00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.143
connect to remote physical storage as if it's local.

55
00:02:57.143 --> 00:03:02.539
And then IEEE 1394 is the specification for what's called FireWire.

56
00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:05.232
Now this is used mostly for external disks,

57
00:03:05.232 --> 00:03:09.101
and to that point, it's largely gone the way of the dodo.

58
00:03:09.101 --> 00:03:12.855
In general, if you have need to connect to FireWire storage nowadays,

59
00:03:12.855 --> 00:03:16.316
you're going to need to purchase an adapter card to

60
00:03:16.316 --> 00:03:18.227
give you the appropriate port.

61
00:03:18.227 --> 00:03:22.565
Nowadays on the outside of a case you're going to have one or more of the USB,

62
00:03:22.565 --> 00:03:27.605
maybe a USB-type C port, and inside a desktop PC anyway,

63
00:03:27.605 --> 00:03:32.157
you're almost guaranteed to see SATA, or Serial Attached SCSI,

64
00:03:32.157 --> 00:03:35.092
depending upon the class of the machine.

65
00:03:35.092 --> 00:03:39.694
Speaking of USB, that's obviously a universal interface for storage,

66
00:03:39.694 --> 00:03:41.605
among many other peripherals.

67
00:03:41.605 --> 00:03:45.380
What you may not be familiar with though is the InfiniBand standard.

68
00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.662
This is used exclusively in business,

69
00:03:47.662 --> 00:03:53.033
and even more exclusively in business enterprises to provide super

70
00:03:53.033 --> 00:03:55.809
high-speed interconnections between servers.

71
00:03:55.809 --> 00:03:58.471
Normally it would be an integrated system,

72
00:03:58.471 --> 00:04:01.120
like Microsoft has what's called Azure STAT.

73
00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.000
It's essentially a black box,

74
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.298
it's a rack device that consists of hyper-converged

75
00:04:06.298 --> 00:04:10.290
systems where you have your servers, and your storage,

76
00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:14.630
and your switches, all together in an integrated rack appliance.

77
00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:17.911
Oracle has sold rack-mounted solutions themselves,

78
00:04:17.911 --> 00:04:23.667
and when you have that kind of density of servers that require super,

79
00:04:23.667 --> 00:04:28.595
super high-speed interconnections, they will generally rely upon InfiniBand,

80
00:04:28.595 --> 00:04:32.507
and then the InfiniBand switch will connect to an Ethernet

81
00:04:32.507 --> 00:04:36.159
switch that gives the servers in that appliance the ability to

82
00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:43.000
connect to the rest of your network, and then of course, ultimately the internet.
