00:00:00,531 --> 00:00:01,826
For further learning,

2
00:00:01,826 --> 00:00:05,759
check out in the Pluralsight library my course Windows

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:08,163
Operating Systems for CompTIA A+.

4
00:00:08,163 --> 00:00:10,868
Specifically take a look at the module Common Maintenance

5
00:00:10,868 --> 00:00:14,100
Procedures where I go into Backup and Recovery there.

6
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,966
There is also Heather Fitzpatrick's OneDrive for Business.

7
00:00:16,966 --> 00:00:19,019
Check out her module Managing Documents,

8
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:27,000
because she gets into versioning at a much greater depth then we do, the Recycle bin, etc.
