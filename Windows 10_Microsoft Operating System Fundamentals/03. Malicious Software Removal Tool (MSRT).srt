1
00:00:01,825 --> 00:00:07,639
Now let's look at the Malicious Software Removal Tool or MSRT for short.

2
00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:11,365
The historical perspective here is that Microsoft has had some

3
00:00:11,365 --> 00:00:14,060
built-in utilities since pretty much the beginning,

4
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:16,607
but back in, say, the Windows 3.

5
00:00:16,607 --> 00:00:20,354
1 days when Windows really began taking off as a graphical

6
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:23,471
operating system there was a company called Norton,

7
00:00:23,471 --> 00:00:25,344
and they had the Norton Utilities.

8
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:27,457
Actually, the Norton Utilities predate Windows,

9
00:00:27,457 --> 00:00:32,244
and the original versions of Norton Utilities would work on MS-DOS,

10
00:00:32,244 --> 00:00:35,342
that was Microsoft's command line operating system

11
00:00:35,342 --> 00:00:40,115
before they developed Windows, and this is an old version of Norton Utilities.

12
00:00:40,115 --> 00:00:44,740
Norton became Symantec, and the products have been broken out since,

13
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:48,798
but the idea was that Norton Utilities gave you much more control

14
00:00:48,798 --> 00:00:51,548
over your system's security and file system,

15
00:00:51,548 --> 00:00:55,546
as opposed to just using inbox utilities with Windows.

16
00:00:55,546 --> 00:00:57,533
Disk Doctor, for instance,

17
00:00:57,533 --> 00:01:01,166
typically could do a better job of repairing and optimizing your hard

18
00:01:01,166 --> 00:01:04,575
disk than could the Windows own Check Disk tool,

19
00:01:04,575 --> 00:01:07,204
for instance, an old MS-DOS utility.

20
00:01:07,204 --> 00:01:11,450
Norton Antivirus wasn't the first antivirus or antimalware client,

21
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:15,810
but it was among the first industry standard ones.

22
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:16,527
Now then,

23
00:01:16,527 --> 00:01:21,415
MSRT is a mysterious tool for many because you normally never interact with it,

24
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:25,005
but you do see it when you're inspecting your Windows updates.

25
00:01:25,005 --> 00:01:26,825
You'll see it flash across the screen,

26
00:01:26,825 --> 00:01:30,455
and you'll notice that you get a new one every month.

27
00:01:30,455 --> 00:01:31,282
That's true.

28
00:01:31,282 --> 00:01:32,938
This is on-demand software,

29
00:01:32,938 --> 00:01:36,108
and by on-demand I shouldn't really have used those words on this slide.

30
00:01:36,108 --> 00:01:38,225
You can run MSRT interactively, in fact,

31
00:01:38,225 --> 00:01:40,711
I'll do so in our first demo today,

32
00:01:40,711 --> 00:01:45,509
but normally what happens is each time you run Windows Update once a

33
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:48,778
month you have that month's version of the MSRT,

34
00:01:48,778 --> 00:01:53,442
and it downloads and runs silently in the background and fixes any

35
00:01:53,442 --> 00:01:56,580
problems without you knowing any differently,

36
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:57,103
okay?

37
00:01:57,103 --> 00:01:59,548
Patch Tuesday is the second Tuesday of the month.

38
00:01:59,548 --> 00:02:03,512
That's the normal release date for Microsoft updates.

39
00:02:03,512 --> 00:02:04,545
Now, of course,

40
00:02:04,545 --> 00:02:07,686
depending upon what vulnerabilities are found in the wild

41
00:02:07,686 --> 00:02:09,611
Microsoft may release out-of-band updates,

42
00:02:09,611 --> 00:02:12,767
but that is meant to be a dependable,

43
00:02:12,767 --> 00:02:17,079
once per month day that systems administrators can plan for because

44
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:20,850
in an enterprise environment you don't want to just blindly push

45
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:23,249
Windows updates to all of your endpoints.

46
00:02:23,249 --> 00:02:26,922
You want to make sure to test them first on some development boxes

47
00:02:26,922 --> 00:02:30,032
to make sure that the updates don't inadvertently break

48
00:02:30,032 --> 00:02:32,329
functionality that your users need each day,

49
00:02:32,329 --> 00:02:32,977
you see?

50
00:02:32,977 --> 00:02:38,301
So MSRT comes down automatically, and it's meant to fix specific vulnerabilities.

51
00:02:38,301 --> 00:02:41,862
If you've ever heard of the term Zero-Day Vulnerability or

52
00:02:41,862 --> 00:02:44,774
O-Day Vulnerability that is a software bug,

53
00:02:44,774 --> 00:02:48,090
in most cases, a weakness in, say, Windows,

54
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:51,507
the Windows code, that no remediation exists for yet,

55
00:02:51,507 --> 00:02:52,267
you see?

56
00:02:52,267 --> 00:02:55,639
So Zero-Days are particularly nasty infections.

57
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:59,648
MSRT is meant to address an already infected system.

58
00:02:59,648 --> 00:03:02,466
It's not an antimalware program in itself,

59
00:03:02,466 --> 00:03:04,077
and as I said,

60
00:03:04,077 --> 00:03:07,093
you can start the tool by just opening a command prompt or

61
00:03:07,093 --> 00:03:14,000
a PowerShell prompt or the run dialog, and typing mrt. I'll show you that momentarily.
