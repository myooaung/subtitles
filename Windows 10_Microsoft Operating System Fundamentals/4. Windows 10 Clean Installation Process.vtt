00:00:02.244 --> 00:00:06.111
Windows 10 Clean Installation.

2
00:00:06.111 --> 00:00:08.120
The perspective here is kind of funny in a way.

3
00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.220
If you've been in IT for a long time like I have,

4
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:15.818
then this screen should bring back some nostalgia and probably some pain.

5
00:00:15.818 --> 00:00:21.707
Back in the 90s when Windows NT server and Windows NT Workstation were the

6
00:00:21.707 --> 00:00:24.871
business versions of Windows at that time and Windows 95,

7
00:00:24.871 --> 00:00:26.938
Windows 98 were the consumer versions,

8
00:00:26.938 --> 00:00:29.499
in order to install those operating systems,

9
00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:32.855
you normally had one to three floppy disks.

10
00:00:32.855 --> 00:00:34.012
Anybody remember those?

11
00:00:34.012 --> 00:00:38.421
And this was because it wasn't assumed that everybody had a

12
00:00:38.421 --> 00:00:43.224
current generation optical drive or CD drive at that time or DVD

13
00:00:43.224 --> 00:00:45.158
drive a bit later on their computer.

14
00:00:45.158 --> 00:00:47.887
So you would start the computer using old school floppies,

15
00:00:47.887 --> 00:00:52.111
and those floppies don't hold much data so you had a text-based interface

16
00:00:52.111 --> 00:00:55.718
like you see here where you use the keyboard to navigate.

17
00:00:55.718 --> 00:00:57.238
It bootstraps the operating system,

18
00:00:57.238 --> 00:01:00.068
it gives you the opportunity to load some device

19
00:01:00.068 --> 00:01:03.752
drivers maybe for your CD drive, maybe for your hard disk.

20
00:01:03.752 --> 00:01:06.829
At that time there was far less standardization with hardware.

21
00:01:06.829 --> 00:01:09.280
It's good that we don't have to do that nowadays.

22
00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.191
The installation of Windows 10 is just crazy easy how streamlined it is.

23
00:01:14.191 --> 00:01:16.892
Now how does this installation work in the real world.

24
00:01:16.892 --> 00:01:20.458
Most consumers I dare say never have to do an installation

25
00:01:20.458 --> 00:01:23.122
or a reinstallation because their OEM,

26
00:01:23.122 --> 00:01:25.876
their original equipment manufacturer has already

27
00:01:25.876 --> 00:01:29.620
done the installation for them, and when you pick up your PC,

28
00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.014
it's pretty much ready to go out of the box.

29
00:01:32.014 --> 00:01:33.719
In the business world though,

30
00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:38.095
Operating System Deployment or OSD is a pretty big deal because you need

31
00:01:38.095 --> 00:01:44.261
to deploy sometimes like I said on mass a lot of desktops and you want

32
00:01:44.261 --> 00:01:46.666
that centralized control and standardization.

33
00:01:46.666 --> 00:01:47.111
Normally,

34
00:01:47.111 --> 00:01:50.669
these business installations of Windows are certainly not

35
00:01:50.669 --> 00:01:54.429
using a DVD disk and putting it physically in any computer

36
00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:56.470
or even using a USB drive.

37
00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.863
You can, in fact, install Windows 10 from a USB.

38
00:01:59.863 --> 00:02:03.573
There is a Media Creator tool that Microsoft makes freely available.

39
00:02:03.573 --> 00:02:06.285
Check the exercise files if you're interested in that.

40
00:02:06.285 --> 00:02:07.086
But in business,

41
00:02:07.086 --> 00:02:09.488
we're doing this over the network over our high

42
00:02:09.488 --> 00:02:12.022
speed ethernet local area network, or LAN.

43
00:02:12.022 --> 00:02:17.634
This gives us scale and consistency, and then as far as features,

44
00:02:17.634 --> 00:02:18.698
Microsoft features,

45
00:02:18.698 --> 00:02:22.668
there is a huge thriving third-party space in operating system deployment,

46
00:02:22.668 --> 00:02:26.032
but Windows deployment services is built into Windows Server,

47
00:02:26.032 --> 00:02:27.677
that's one way to go.

48
00:02:27.677 --> 00:02:30.514
Microsoft Deployment Toolkit kind of puts WDS on steroids,

49
00:02:30.514 --> 00:02:33.495
it gives you a heck of a lot more capabilities,

50
00:02:33.495 --> 00:02:35.035
that's also a free download.

51
00:02:35.035 --> 00:02:37.520
What's not free are the System Center tools,

52
00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.133
this is a whole suite of server utilities that Microsoft makes.

53
00:02:41.133 --> 00:02:43.786
System Center Configuration Manager, or SCCM,

54
00:02:43.786 --> 00:02:48.413
allows you to do a fully automated hands-off operating system

55
00:02:48.413 --> 00:02:52.846
deployments where by the time the user logs onto their system,

56
00:02:52.846 --> 00:02:56.750
it's already standardized for all of your network security policies,

57
00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.940
it's already potentially updated with patches and it's got firewall and

58
00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:10.000
all of the line of business apps all ready to go. That's how business is done nowadays and installing Windows in the real world.
