1
00:00:02,352 --> 00:00:04,746
In this demonstration we'll take a look at service accounts,

2
00:00:04,746 --> 00:00:07,914
as well as the Malicious Software Removal Tool.

3
00:00:07,914 --> 00:00:11,042
I'm going to right-click my Start button and go to Run.

4
00:00:11,042 --> 00:00:13,218
This is one of my favorite techniques.

5
00:00:13,218 --> 00:00:15,765
If you know the command line or, specifically,

6
00:00:15,765 --> 00:00:19,434
the file name or the executable name that you're interested in

7
00:00:19,434 --> 00:00:22,163
you can often save yourself a lot of clicking.

8
00:00:22,163 --> 00:00:25,877
I mean, it's true that we've also been using the Cortana search,

9
00:00:25,877 --> 00:00:29,154
as well as the Windows search just by typing.

10
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:32,915
Maybe this is a remnant of the fact that I'm so accustomed to

11
00:00:32,915 --> 00:00:36,349
using the Windows key R key combination typing,

12
00:00:36,349 --> 00:00:37,750
for instance, services.

13
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:42,783
msc to open the Service Control Manager Graphical User Interface.

14
00:00:42,783 --> 00:00:45,829
So here we have an alphabetical list of all of the services

15
00:00:45,829 --> 00:00:48,449
that are currently registered on this machine.

16
00:00:48,449 --> 00:00:52,158
When you're doing performance tuning and least privilege stuff it's

17
00:00:52,158 --> 00:00:55,127
often useful to aggregate all of the running services,

18
00:00:55,127 --> 00:00:58,509
so I'll click the Status column a couple times to put

19
00:00:58,509 --> 00:00:59,837
all the running services together,

20
00:00:59,837 --> 00:01:03,556
and then you can audit them one by one to make sure that the

21
00:01:03,556 --> 00:01:05,682
ones that you want to run are running.

22
00:01:05,682 --> 00:01:08,959
I have some third-party software installed on this machine,

23
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:13,053
so you see Netwrix Auditor has a whole bunch of services here.

24
00:01:13,053 --> 00:01:15,535
I'm not sure I'm particularly happy with that.

25
00:01:15,535 --> 00:01:17,476
Let me double left-click the Core Service,

26
00:01:17,476 --> 00:01:20,110
and you'll notice that you can stop, start,

27
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:23,022
pause, or resume services through this control.

28
00:01:23,022 --> 00:01:25,226
You can change the Startup type.

29
00:01:25,226 --> 00:01:26,696
There's Automatic (Delayed Start).

30
00:01:26,696 --> 00:01:30,684
That's useful for services that take longer than normal to start.

31
00:01:30,684 --> 00:01:33,474
Then there's Automatic, Manual, and Disabled.

32
00:01:33,474 --> 00:01:37,213
Sometimes you'll set a service to Manual expecting that it will

33
00:01:37,213 --> 00:01:39,492
be stopped unless you explicitly start it,

34
00:01:39,492 --> 00:01:43,264
but sometimes if it's a service that Windows needs or if you

35
00:01:43,264 --> 00:01:46,513
start an application that requires that service it'll start

36
00:01:46,513 --> 00:01:50,047
automatically at that time, which is fine in many cases.

37
00:01:50,047 --> 00:01:51,328
Be careful with disabling.

38
00:01:51,328 --> 00:01:53,683
That can break functionality on your system,

39
00:01:53,683 --> 00:01:57,601
but you can reduce attack surface and increase performance by

40
00:01:57,601 --> 00:02:00,563
disabling services that you know you don't need.

41
00:02:00,563 --> 00:02:03,055
I'm going to manually set this to Manual,

42
00:02:03,055 --> 00:02:06,755
and I'm going to stop it because I want to show you that you can also,

43
00:02:06,755 --> 00:02:11,252
let me actually do an alphabetical sort now and come down to Netwrix.

44
00:02:11,252 --> 00:02:12,128
Here we go.

45
00:02:12,128 --> 00:02:15,046
Core Service, it's set for Manual, and it's not running.

46
00:02:15,046 --> 00:02:19,470
You can right-click and do a Start or Restart or something else.

47
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:21,452
Now in some cases there's dependencies,

48
00:02:21,452 --> 00:02:26,657
and you won't be able to start or stop a service because of its dependencies.

49
00:02:26,657 --> 00:02:27,568
In this case,

50
00:02:27,568 --> 00:02:31,773
it looks like the Netwrix Core Service depends upon Remote Procedure Call,

51
00:02:31,773 --> 00:02:34,713
and then specifically a couple subservices,

52
00:02:34,713 --> 00:02:36,840
so it's important to take a look at that.

53
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,077
Whoops,

54
00:02:37,077 --> 00:02:39,507
I shouldn't have closed that out so quickly because

55
00:02:39,507 --> 00:02:41,514
I also want to show you this.

56
00:02:41,514 --> 00:02:45,209
Looks like Netwrix, because it's a network capable application,

57
00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:47,576
defaults to use the Network Service identity.

58
00:02:47,576 --> 00:02:49,209
Now I did not add this.

59
00:02:49,209 --> 00:02:51,115
I didn't do anything with the password.

60
00:02:51,115 --> 00:02:53,978
This happened as a handshake between Netwrix and

61
00:02:53,978 --> 00:02:55,990
Windows as I installed the software.

62
00:02:55,990 --> 00:03:00,621
Probably run into problems if I flip that down to Local System account.

63
00:03:00,621 --> 00:03:01,898
Finally, there's recovery.

64
00:03:01,898 --> 00:03:05,800
When you're troubleshooting it can sometimes be helpful to attempt

65
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,962
to restart the service automatically on failure.

66
00:03:08,962 --> 00:03:12,762
Sometimes specifically on web servers I'll set this for the Internet

67
00:03:12,762 --> 00:03:16,186
Information Services service that if there's a failure restart the

68
00:03:16,186 --> 00:03:20,445
service because if this is an important website that your customers

69
00:03:20,445 --> 00:03:24,654
and your users use a transient failure the service just glitching and

70
00:03:24,654 --> 00:03:29,238
stopping for a moment, you'll want to auto-remediate that wherever possible.

71
00:03:29,238 --> 00:03:31,202
Now coming down to the W's.

72
00:03:31,202 --> 00:03:34,148
Here we have a number of Windows Defender services.

73
00:03:34,148 --> 00:03:36,177
There's the Advanced Threat Protection.

74
00:03:36,177 --> 00:03:40,758
This is the client software that is only necessary if you're onboarding the

75
00:03:40,758 --> 00:03:45,131
machine to an Office 365 based instance of Defender ATP.

76
00:03:45,131 --> 00:03:48,363
There's the Antivirus Network Inspection Service,

77
00:03:48,363 --> 00:03:52,447
the Antivirus Core, the Firewall, Security Center.

78
00:03:52,447 --> 00:03:54,455
Make sure that those are all running,

79
00:03:54,455 --> 00:03:57,756
and it looks like the Network Inspection is set to manual,

80
00:03:57,756 --> 00:04:01,327
and it will only kick in when network connectivity is active.

81
00:04:01,327 --> 00:04:05,878
Let me open this up and just for grins let's take a look.

82
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:08,372
It's running under the Local System context,

83
00:04:08,372 --> 00:04:17,000
and notice that it's not letting us override that. That's a good thing, I think, because Windows Defender is protecting our system.
