Hi there, welcome to Pluralsight.

2
00:00:02.378 --> 00:00:04.757
My name is Tim Warner.

3
00:00:04.757 --> 00:00:09.117
This module is entitled Windows 10 Backup and Recovery.

4
00:00:09.117 --> 00:00:12.578
We have a lot to cover in this module, because frankly,

5
00:00:12.578 --> 00:00:15.107
backup and recovery is a crucially important topic,

6
00:00:15.107 --> 00:00:19.238
whether you're a consumer or a business user of Windows 10.

7
00:00:19.238 --> 00:00:22.698
We're going to go through built-in tools like System Restore,

8
00:00:22.698 --> 00:00:23.278
File History,

9
00:00:23.278 --> 00:00:27.269
we'll look at how to recover files from OneDrive and OneDrive for Business,

10
00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.416
we'll look at Windows Backup, and then finish with Recovery Drive.

11
00:00:31.416 --> 00:00:34.310
A lot of options for backing up.

12
00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:38.000
I also want to frame our discussion and the critical importance of,

13
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
well, backing up your data. Let's get started.
