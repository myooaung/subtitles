00:00:01.752 --> 00:00:03.627
In summary, what have we learned in this training?

2
00:00:03.627 --> 00:00:06.604
Well, least privilege security is no joke.

3
00:00:06.604 --> 00:00:08.750
I mean, years, and years, and years ago,

4
00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:11.926
say Windows NT in the 90's and early, early 2000's,

5
00:00:11.926 --> 00:00:16.149
a lot of the OS level security was open by default,

6
00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:18.924
and it was up to the administrator to constrain.

7
00:00:18.924 --> 00:00:21.072
Now, fortunately, it's pretty much the opposite,

8
00:00:21.072 --> 00:00:23.062
where much is locked down by default,

9
00:00:23.062 --> 00:00:26.013
and that's the way it should be for least privilege security,

10
00:00:26.013 --> 00:00:30.515
and then you make judicious exceptions based on your use case.

11
00:00:30.515 --> 00:00:35.073
Specifically, ransomware has been devastating in 2017 in particular,

12
00:00:35.073 --> 00:00:37.828
and the notion of Ransomware as a Service means that you don't have

13
00:00:37.828 --> 00:00:41.136
to be a programmer to launch devastating attacks,

14
00:00:41.136 --> 00:00:44.718
and ransomware normally comes in through malicious or phishing email,

15
00:00:44.718 --> 00:00:46.450
and of course malicious code,

16
00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:51.287
and potential vulnerabilities in the SMB file sharing stack in Windows,

17
00:00:51.287 --> 00:00:56.180
so you need to have your antivirus and antimalware up-to-date and on point,

18
00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.737
so it can capture those kind of problems before they actually hit.

19
00:00:59.737 --> 00:01:03.960
No Windows device should be without either antimalware or firewall,

20
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.978
and as I've said earlier, I've had great luck relying upon the Microsoft tools,

21
00:01:08.978 --> 00:01:12.949
the Windows Defender Firewall, and the Windows Defender Antimalware Client.

22
00:01:12.949 --> 00:01:14.922
Just leave them enabled.

23
00:01:14.922 --> 00:01:15.685
That's what I say.

24
00:01:15.685 --> 00:01:18.868
In the next module we'll turn our attention to Windows 10 File Systems,

25
00:01:18.868 --> 00:01:22.425
as well as we'll inject some security, yet again,

26
00:01:22.425 --> 00:01:25.394
by examining various data encryption methods.

27
00:01:25.394 --> 00:01:28.000
Thanks for hanging in. I'll see you then.
