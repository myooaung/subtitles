1
00:00:01,844 --> 00:00:02,814
In this demonstration,

2
00:00:02,814 --> 00:00:06,583
we'll start with Cortana and how it integrates with Microsoft Edge.

3
00:00:06,583 --> 00:00:09,735
So getting started in my Windows 10 machine,

4
00:00:09,735 --> 00:00:13,567
Cortana is enabled by default and if you've noticed thus far that

5
00:00:13,567 --> 00:00:16,221
your taskbar looks a bit different from mine,

6
00:00:16,221 --> 00:00:19,458
I intentionally hid some items to make things more compact.

7
00:00:19,458 --> 00:00:23,737
If we right-click an empty area of the taskbar and come up to Cortana,

8
00:00:23,737 --> 00:00:27,371
you notice that you can hide or show Cortana by selecting

9
00:00:27,371 --> 00:00:31,241
Cortana hidden yes or no and then you can choose,

10
00:00:31,241 --> 00:00:34,528
I'm going to unselect hidden there, and come back again,

11
00:00:34,528 --> 00:00:38,614
you can show just the Cortana icon which looks like a little

12
00:00:38,614 --> 00:00:41,473
circle or right-click Cortana show the search box,

13
00:00:41,473 --> 00:00:46,122
type here to search and you can actually use your microphone

14
00:00:46,122 --> 00:00:49,085
for what's called Hey Cortana functionality.

15
00:00:49,085 --> 00:00:51,653
If you click in that search box, once again,

16
00:00:51,653 --> 00:00:54,932
depending upon how you have Cortana set up,

17
00:00:54,932 --> 00:01:00,935
you could simply speak or type Nashville weather let's say and you'll notice

18
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:04,043
that the results show up immediately over on the right.

19
00:01:04,043 --> 00:01:07,342
It looks like it's giving us from Bing which is Microsoft's own

20
00:01:07,342 --> 00:01:10,370
search engine current conditions in Nashville,

21
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:10,875
TN.

22
00:01:10,875 --> 00:01:13,071
Let me right-click, come up to Cortana,

23
00:01:13,071 --> 00:01:16,202
and just show the icon because I want to step you

24
00:01:16,202 --> 00:01:17,451
through how to configure Cortana.

25
00:01:17,451 --> 00:01:19,298
So we'll open the icon up,

26
00:01:19,298 --> 00:01:22,659
it gets basically the same interface that we saw before.

27
00:01:22,659 --> 00:01:27,021
Notice that you can filter specifically on various filters like apps,

28
00:01:27,021 --> 00:01:31,684
documents, and web, and then there is this Cortana can do much more.

29
00:01:31,684 --> 00:01:35,552
If you open that and you haven't yet consented to Cortana data collection,

30
00:01:35,552 --> 00:01:36,841
you're asked to do so,

31
00:01:36,841 --> 00:01:40,301
and the way that you need to do that first is by

32
00:01:40,301 --> 00:01:42,162
signing in with your Microsoft account.

33
00:01:42,162 --> 00:01:44,062
I trust you have a Microsoft account.

34
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:47,363
If you don't, I'd suggest you create one, they're free to create.

35
00:01:47,363 --> 00:01:52,113
I give you some links in the exercise files to get you started with that.

36
00:01:52,113 --> 00:01:54,085
I'm going to click Sign in.

37
00:01:54,085 --> 00:01:57,551
I've already used a particular account and I'm going to

38
00:01:57,551 --> 00:01:59,793
reuse and associate with Cortana now.

39
00:01:59,793 --> 00:02:02,015
Now if we open the bottom drop-down,

40
00:02:02,015 --> 00:02:05,442
we're asked would we like Cortana to work across devices.

41
00:02:05,442 --> 00:02:06,203
Remember earlier,

42
00:02:06,203 --> 00:02:11,461
I mentioned that the Edge browser is intended to be a unified interface

43
00:02:11,461 --> 00:02:15,202
across different devices and one of the benefits actually of your

44
00:02:15,202 --> 00:02:18,399
Microsoft account and signing into Windows 10 with your Microsoft account

45
00:02:18,399 --> 00:02:23,409
is that you can share many of your preferences and settings and even

46
00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:26,404
applications across computers, so your home computer,

47
00:02:26,404 --> 00:02:27,629
your work computer,

48
00:02:27,629 --> 00:02:31,542
all these machines can enjoy the same search results

49
00:02:31,542 --> 00:02:33,060
and environment thanks to this.

50
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,440
And what this is asking us here is would we like

51
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,648
Cortana to work on our mobile device, and as you see,

52
00:02:39,648 --> 00:02:44,519
we have links for the Google Play and the Apple iOS App store.

53
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:49,583
So yes, Cortana can and does work in mobile environments as well.

54
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:51,920
I'm going to select not now here and it looks like

55
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,144
Cortana wants to give us some news here.

56
00:02:54,144 --> 00:02:55,095
And again, specifically,

57
00:02:55,095 --> 00:02:59,815
all of the data that Cortana gives you over time is going to be

58
00:02:59,815 --> 00:03:03,013
customized based on the information you give to her.

59
00:03:03,013 --> 00:03:05,708
For instance, Get traffic updates for your commute,

60
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:07,828
I need your work address to do that.

61
00:03:07,828 --> 00:03:10,203
And then in order to specify that,

62
00:03:10,203 --> 00:03:13,353
we need to customize the data collection for Cortana.

63
00:03:13,353 --> 00:03:17,809
So we'll click Settings here and we're taken into the settings app

64
00:03:17,809 --> 00:03:21,152
that I introduced you to in the previous module.

65
00:03:21,152 --> 00:03:24,773
It looks like I have location services turned off on this

66
00:03:24,773 --> 00:03:28,697
device so I would turn that on as one option.

67
00:03:28,697 --> 00:03:33,279
This would allow Microsoft and Cortana to understand where I am in the world,

68
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:39,026
and then I can set a default location if I want to that Cortana will use if

69
00:03:39,026 --> 00:03:42,365
it's unable to determine what my current location is.

70
00:03:42,365 --> 00:03:45,590
Okay, I'm going to answer yes to this question,

71
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:48,595
it looks like the maps application is opened up.

72
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:49,659
As you see here,

73
00:03:49,659 --> 00:03:53,198
you can just step through the wizard to specify your default location.

74
00:03:53,198 --> 00:03:55,105
If you're concerned about security,

75
00:03:55,105 --> 00:03:58,424
notice that you can at any time clear the location history.

76
00:03:58,424 --> 00:04:01,657
You may have a laptop computer that you travel with and you may have

77
00:04:01,657 --> 00:04:05,256
quite a few locations associated with Cortana.

78
00:04:05,256 --> 00:04:07,457
Again, that can be a great convenience.

79
00:04:07,457 --> 00:04:10,363
I, myself, go to the Microsoft campus in Redmond,

80
00:04:10,363 --> 00:04:14,954
Washington a lot and it's really nice that Cortana functions and gives me

81
00:04:14,954 --> 00:04:18,784
personalized results for my searches and what I do there.

82
00:04:18,784 --> 00:04:21,642
And then when I'm home here in Nashville, it's the same thing.

83
00:04:21,642 --> 00:04:23,233
Now if we come back home,

84
00:04:23,233 --> 00:04:27,537
you'll notice that the root level of the settings app actually has an

85
00:04:27,537 --> 00:04:31,149
entire category related to Cortana so let's select that.

86
00:04:31,149 --> 00:04:35,495
Now you can calibrate your microphone and have Cortana respond to your

87
00:04:35,495 --> 00:04:38,467
voice by checking the status of your microphone.

88
00:04:38,467 --> 00:04:41,188
I don't have a mic on this computer so I can't do that.

89
00:04:41,188 --> 00:04:44,522
And then once you've associated your microphone that Windows

90
00:04:44,522 --> 00:04:47,254
knows that you have one and that it's working,

91
00:04:47,254 --> 00:04:50,083
you can let Cortana respond to hey Cortana.

92
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:54,144
This allows Cortana literally at any point in time

93
00:04:54,144 --> 00:04:58,131
you can say hey Cortana and it, she, I use she,

94
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:58,493
personification,

95
00:04:58,493 --> 00:05:03,152
but it will respond to your query and again check the exercise files if

96
00:05:03,152 --> 00:05:06,587
you're wondering the kind of things that you can have her do,

97
00:05:06,587 --> 00:05:11,436
set reminders, open applications, perform a web search,

98
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:12,042
etc.

99
00:05:12,042 --> 00:05:13,254
Let's see anything else.

100
00:05:13,254 --> 00:05:15,679
Use Cortana even when your device is locked.

101
00:05:15,679 --> 00:05:19,699
Let Cortana access additional data including calendar,

102
00:05:19,699 --> 00:05:23,227
email, messages, and power BI data when your data is locked,

103
00:05:23,227 --> 00:05:25,662
what language you want Cortana to use.

104
00:05:25,662 --> 00:05:28,884
It's defaulting to my home region, English United States.

105
00:05:28,884 --> 00:05:34,084
Now if you plan to use that hey Cortana feature or if you just prefer to

106
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:37,355
be able to use your voice from the context of search,

107
00:05:37,355 --> 00:05:41,528
you're going to want to train or have Cortana train to learn your voice.

108
00:05:41,528 --> 00:05:44,407
Let me close out of settings and open Cortana again.

109
00:05:44,407 --> 00:05:47,773
I mentioned in the slides portion of this lesson that

110
00:05:47,773 --> 00:05:50,109
Cortana has what's called a notebook.

111
00:05:50,109 --> 00:05:54,004
Let me expand this left part here and you notice that there is a devices

112
00:05:54,004 --> 00:05:59,246
option where you can again calibrate your microphone and looks like there is

113
00:05:59,246 --> 00:06:01,859
an advertisement to buy a Microsoft Cortana speaker.

114
00:06:01,859 --> 00:06:03,585
Huh, I learn something new every day.

115
00:06:03,585 --> 00:06:05,065
I'm learning this along with you.

116
00:06:05,065 --> 00:06:07,746
Although, frankly by the time you're watching this lesson,

117
00:06:07,746 --> 00:06:10,089
you may already own a Cortana speaker.

118
00:06:10,089 --> 00:06:10,759
I don't.

119
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:13,530
I'm actually learning of its existence right now.

120
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:13,950
Oh yes.

121
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,629
I think I've seen the news on this.

122
00:06:15,629 --> 00:06:19,588
Harman/Kardon has a product called Invoke that uses Cortana.

123
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:21,863
That would compete directly with, for instance,

124
00:06:21,863 --> 00:06:25,160
that Google Home appliance or Amazon's Echo device.

125
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:29,552
But anyway, come back to Cortana and if we go to the Notebook option,

126
00:06:29,552 --> 00:06:32,806
this is where you get your Cortana specific configuration info,

127
00:06:32,806 --> 00:06:36,957
and depending upon how generous you are with your data,

128
00:06:36,957 --> 00:06:40,340
you can have Cortana call you by a particular name,

129
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:42,938
know your favorite geographic locations,

130
00:06:42,938 --> 00:06:46,524
lists and reminders that you instruct her to create,

131
00:06:46,524 --> 00:06:47,876
link to music accounts.

132
00:06:47,876 --> 00:06:49,426
I, myself, use Spotify.

133
00:06:49,426 --> 00:06:52,574
This is particularly very helpful to me actually

134
00:06:52,574 --> 00:06:55,621
because I use Spotify every single day.

135
00:06:55,621 --> 00:06:59,298
So I'm making a note to myself that after I finish recording this demo,

136
00:06:59,298 --> 00:07:04,125
I'm going to configure this integration so I can more easily control Spotify.

137
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:07,621
Skills is something that Cortana has recently added that I

138
00:07:07,621 --> 00:07:09,569
should say Microsoft has recently added.

139
00:07:09,569 --> 00:07:10,507
I have a,

140
00:07:10,507 --> 00:07:14,674
well my wife and I should say technically have an Amazon Echo device

141
00:07:14,674 --> 00:07:18,046
at home and Alexa is the name of that assistant,

142
00:07:18,046 --> 00:07:21,527
and skills are cool because they're third-party plugins that extend

143
00:07:21,527 --> 00:07:25,652
the functionality of the device and it looks like we've got skills

144
00:07:25,652 --> 00:07:27,851
coming to Cortana platform as well.

145
00:07:27,851 --> 00:07:30,029
To configure the voice training, go into Notebook,

146
00:07:30,029 --> 00:07:33,091
and as long as you have a microphone that's enabled,

147
00:07:33,091 --> 00:07:36,733
you can enable hey Cortana and there'll be a settings option here.

148
00:07:36,733 --> 00:07:39,105
I don't have it because, as I've said before,

149
00:07:39,105 --> 00:07:41,809
I don't have a microphone available in this virtual machine,

150
00:07:41,809 --> 00:07:45,843
but in the Settings Panel, you'll be able to run a voice training,

151
00:07:45,843 --> 00:07:46,420
in fact,

152
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:50,105
I'll put an overlay on this demo so you can see what it

153
00:07:50,105 --> 00:07:53,802
looks like at lest on your screen, and by training Cortana on your voice,

154
00:07:53,802 --> 00:07:56,342
you can teach her not only to pronounce your name,

155
00:07:56,342 --> 00:07:59,826
but also to be able to respond better to the commands that you give.

156
00:07:59,826 --> 00:08:01,053
Pretty cool, isn't it.

157
00:08:01,053 --> 00:08:04,624
Now I mentioned the Edge, the Edge browser integrates with Cortana,

158
00:08:04,624 --> 00:08:08,352
that's certainly true, and what that means is you can,

159
00:08:08,352 --> 00:08:13,215
for instance, find a word of phrase that's interesting like here is CGI,

160
00:08:13,215 --> 00:08:16,205
whoops, you can select a word or phrase.

161
00:08:16,205 --> 00:08:19,977
I know CGI in this context refers to a business name,

162
00:08:19,977 --> 00:08:22,474
but CGI also is a technical term.

163
00:08:22,474 --> 00:08:27,145
You can right-click to ask Cortana about that and Cortana brings up a pane

164
00:08:27,145 --> 00:08:30,908
that you can open as you see here that will define the word,

165
00:08:30,908 --> 00:08:33,628
give you additional information depending upon what

166
00:08:33,628 --> 00:08:35,145
it is that you're looking for.

167
00:08:35,145 --> 00:08:35,903
Isn't that cool?

168
00:08:35,903 --> 00:08:37,141
And then it says here,

169
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:39,864
it asks us to start a wizard to create a more

170
00:08:39,864 --> 00:08:42,656
personalized experience and it looks like here,

171
00:08:42,656 --> 00:08:46,193
okay, let Cortana collect and use your browsing history.

172
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:48,263
So the pattern you've seen here, I hope,

173
00:08:48,263 --> 00:08:51,654
is that as you begin to use Cortana in different contexts,

174
00:08:51,654 --> 00:08:55,888
you'll be prompted to consent to that type of data collection.

175
00:08:55,888 --> 00:08:58,461
So there is voice level data collection,

176
00:08:58,461 --> 00:09:01,082
there is the email and context integration,

177
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:02,988
contacts I should say, integration,

178
00:09:02,988 --> 00:09:06,661
and then in Edge when you're integrating with Cortana,

179
00:09:06,661 --> 00:09:15,000
it's a similar thing where you're asked to allow to share your browsing history in Edge with Microsoft.
