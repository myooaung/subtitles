1
00:00:01,338 --> 00:00:03,607
Windows Updates.

2
00:00:03,607 --> 00:00:06,859
The first thing I want to do here is differentiate the three

3
00:00:06,859 --> 00:00:09,323
types of update that Microsoft publishes.

4
00:00:09,323 --> 00:00:11,726
Now these are code fixes.

5
00:00:11,726 --> 00:00:15,927
They could be bug fixes that fix just performance-related

6
00:00:15,927 --> 00:00:18,096
code flaws in the Windows code base.

7
00:00:18,096 --> 00:00:21,121
Most often they have to do with some kind of security

8
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:22,724
vulnerability that's been published,

9
00:00:22,724 --> 00:00:28,079
but we have feature updates at this point coming out twice a year,

10
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:30,597
the creator's updates, spring and fall.

11
00:00:30,597 --> 00:00:33,927
Those are formally called by Microsoft feature updates,

12
00:00:33,927 --> 00:00:39,014
and this is basically the equivalent, if not a bit more than the equivalent,

13
00:00:39,014 --> 00:00:43,155
of the service pack that used to be the standard with Windows Client,

14
00:00:43,155 --> 00:00:45,617
and even Windows Server over time.

15
00:00:45,617 --> 00:00:48,224
You would have the base operating system,

16
00:00:48,224 --> 00:00:52,653
the generally available, or GA copy, and then in a year or so,

17
00:00:52,653 --> 00:00:55,179
whenever Microsoft had enough updates rolled up together,

18
00:00:55,179 --> 00:00:58,482
and maybe some new features that have come through the pike,

19
00:00:58,482 --> 00:01:00,884
they would be added to a service pack.

20
00:01:00,884 --> 00:01:03,011
Well now in Windows, Windows Client,

21
00:01:03,011 --> 00:01:07,056
we have these semi-annual big releases that add new functionality,

22
00:01:07,056 --> 00:01:12,035
as well as rolling up changes that you might not have picked up

23
00:01:12,035 --> 00:01:13,965
through the ordinary Windows Update process.

24
00:01:13,965 --> 00:01:17,080
Quality updates are the normal Windows updates that are

25
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,928
delivered the second Tuesday of every month,

26
00:01:19,928 --> 00:01:22,947
what we systems administrators call Patch Tuesday.

27
00:01:22,947 --> 00:01:27,009
And the reason Microsoft does these quality updates on a schedule is

28
00:01:27,009 --> 00:01:31,338
to give configuration managers an opportunity to plan ahead because

29
00:01:31,338 --> 00:01:35,638
doubtless they'll want to test these updates on some lab systems to

30
00:01:35,638 --> 00:01:39,817
make sure that an update doesn't inadvertently break functionality

31
00:01:39,817 --> 00:01:41,401
elsewhere on the system.

32
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:44,676
Non-deferrable updates are updates that you have no choice

33
00:01:44,676 --> 00:01:46,772
but to receive when Microsoft sends them,

34
00:01:46,772 --> 00:01:51,492
and those are things like definition updates for Windows Defender.

35
00:01:51,492 --> 00:01:54,837
I mentioned earlier when we covered antimalware that it's

36
00:01:54,837 --> 00:01:57,887
utterly crucial that you A) have an antimalware product

37
00:01:57,887 --> 00:02:00,143
installed on your system at all times,

38
00:02:00,143 --> 00:02:04,253
and B) you ensure to update its definition so that the software

39
00:02:04,253 --> 00:02:06,838
can remediate against the latest threats.

40
00:02:06,838 --> 00:02:09,505
The same thing happens with Windows Update.

41
00:02:09,505 --> 00:02:12,535
If you're not regularly applying updates from Microsoft,

42
00:02:12,535 --> 00:02:17,090
then you may be leaving vulnerabilities open that could result in

43
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:27,000
catastrophic data loss in the case of ransomware, and/or the possibility of things like identity theft and financial loss.
