00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.576
Okay,

2
00:00:00.576 --> 00:00:04.611
in this demonstration we'll work with TCP/IP

3
00:00:04.611 --> 00:00:06.410
network configuration in Windows 10.

4
00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:11.278
As I mentioned, or as I started in the slide portion a few minutes ago,

5
00:00:11.278 --> 00:00:15.354
down here in your notification area you can hover over your

6
00:00:15.354 --> 00:00:19.695
Wi-Fi and/or your wired icons to get a very terse summary of

7
00:00:19.695 --> 00:00:23.177
your network connection names, and whether or not you have internet access.

8
00:00:23.177 --> 00:00:27.526
If you left-click, it brings up a menu where you can make a selection,

9
00:00:27.526 --> 00:00:30.031
and if you make a selection like I just did,

10
00:00:30.031 --> 00:00:34.147
it takes us into Network & Internet, Ethernet or Wi-Fi,

11
00:00:34.147 --> 00:00:36.024
depending upon what you have going.

12
00:00:36.024 --> 00:00:37.786
I'm going to minimize the settings window,

13
00:00:37.786 --> 00:00:42.011
though, because you can use Windows R or right-click the Start button,

14
00:00:42.011 --> 00:00:42.435
Run.

15
00:00:42.435 --> 00:00:43.001
Ncpa.

16
00:00:43.001 --> 00:00:48.660
cpl, that's the filename for the Network Connections Control Panel,

17
00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.628
and it's a muscle memory thing that many students have

18
00:00:51.628 --> 00:00:56.052
thanked me for turning them onto, so I wanted to make sure you had that info.

19
00:00:56.052 --> 00:01:00.348
And if you double left-click a connection like my internal Ethernet connection,

20
00:01:00.348 --> 00:01:02.723
it says No network access at all.

21
00:01:02.723 --> 00:01:05.661
We can see down below activity, Sent and Received,

22
00:01:05.661 --> 00:01:08.670
the link speed, how long it's been enabled or disabled.

23
00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.013
You can disable a network connection here.

24
00:01:11.013 --> 00:01:13.357
Notice that that has the UAC shield.

25
00:01:13.357 --> 00:01:18.661
You can also right-click the connection to disable it, get its status, etc.

26
00:01:18.661 --> 00:01:19.408
But, anyway,

27
00:01:19.408 --> 00:01:23.891
on the Status details page this gives you a text run of

28
00:01:23.891 --> 00:01:26.780
information like your IP address configuration,

29
00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.806
the physical address of the network interface,

30
00:01:29.806 --> 00:01:32.971
the so-called media access control, or MAC address.

31
00:01:32.971 --> 00:01:34.467
If you want to make changes, though,

32
00:01:34.467 --> 00:01:37.435
what you'll want to get in the habit of is right-clicking

33
00:01:37.435 --> 00:01:39.643
on the icon and selecting Properties.

34
00:01:39.643 --> 00:01:43.073
This brings up a Properties sheet that really hasn't changed in many,

35
00:01:43.073 --> 00:01:44.035
many, many years.

36
00:01:44.035 --> 00:01:48.285
You can configure the network interface up above and the protocols down below.

37
00:01:48.285 --> 00:01:50.307
Now there's lots of components here.

38
00:01:50.307 --> 00:01:53.462
There's the Client component, that always needs to be on,

39
00:01:53.462 --> 00:01:56.966
File and Printer Sharing needs to be on in a business environment,

40
00:01:56.966 --> 00:01:59.358
Quality of Service, or QoS Packet Scheduler,

41
00:01:59.358 --> 00:02:02.121
we can get into a discussion on that at another time.

42
00:02:02.121 --> 00:02:06.693
The main thing I want to show you are the entries for TCP/IP v4 and v6.

43
00:02:06.693 --> 00:02:09.068
We're going to focus on v4.

44
00:02:09.068 --> 00:02:10.823
If we double left-click that,

45
00:02:10.823 --> 00:02:14.485
it brings out the specific Properties sheet for that component.

46
00:02:14.485 --> 00:02:17.986
So walking it back, we have our Ethernet adapter,

47
00:02:17.986 --> 00:02:23.246
we have the TCP/IPv4 enabled, and then we have the Properties for it.

48
00:02:23.246 --> 00:02:27.273
And the options are to use DHCP automatic address assignment,

49
00:02:27.273 --> 00:02:30.185
or static, and you'll notice that I've done static here.

50
00:02:30.185 --> 00:02:32.775
The downside to static is that human error,

51
00:02:32.775 --> 00:02:35.142
I could mistype something and cause problems.

52
00:02:35.142 --> 00:02:40.382
The upside is that I know that this machine will always be at 10.

53
00:02:40.382 --> 00:02:40.798
0.

54
00:02:40.798 --> 00:02:41.214
0.

55
00:02:41.214 --> 00:02:41.630
2/24.

56
00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.795
I've also pointed to a specific DNS server in my environment.

57
00:02:45.795 --> 00:02:47.188
I don't need a router.

58
00:02:47.188 --> 00:02:52.648
This is a single subnet network, so that's why default gateway is empty, okay?

59
00:02:52.648 --> 00:02:56.018
So those are the basics of configuring TCP/IP.

60
00:02:56.018 --> 00:02:58.003
Let me right-click my External.

61
00:02:58.003 --> 00:03:08.000
I believe this one is DHCP, so I'll double left-click TCP v4. Yep, sure enough, obtain an IP address automatically.
