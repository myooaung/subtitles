1
00:00:00,476 --> 00:00:06,379
Okay, it's time for us to examine diagnostic startup in Windows.

2
00:00:06,379 --> 00:00:09,116
Remember I mentioned there are several ways to do it.

3
00:00:09,116 --> 00:00:11,754
As long as you can do it from within Windows,

4
00:00:11,754 --> 00:00:14,936
the easiest way I've found is to open the Start button,

5
00:00:14,936 --> 00:00:17,444
click the Power button, hold down Shift,

6
00:00:17,444 --> 00:00:20,894
remember, hold down Shift, not Ctrl, not Option,

7
00:00:20,894 --> 00:00:24,145
but Shift, and with your Shift key held down,

8
00:00:24,145 --> 00:00:24,827
click Restart.

9
00:00:24,827 --> 00:00:26,907
That's going to force a restart of the system,

10
00:00:26,907 --> 00:00:29,464
and it'll reboot into the Windows Recovery Environment,

11
00:00:29,464 --> 00:00:31,506
which you see right here.

12
00:00:31,506 --> 00:00:31,722
Now,

13
00:00:31,722 --> 00:00:35,747
these screens are a review of what I showed you in the slides just a moment ago,

14
00:00:35,747 --> 00:00:38,045
so we can proceed right to the details.

15
00:00:38,045 --> 00:00:39,372
Let's go to Troubleshoot.

16
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:42,359
We're asked to Reset or go to Advanced options.

17
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:43,513
I want Advanced options.

18
00:00:43,513 --> 00:00:45,244
Let's test some of these out.

19
00:00:45,244 --> 00:00:46,674
We go to System Restore,

20
00:00:46,674 --> 00:00:50,423
it's going to restart the computer again using 640 x 480 resolution,

21
00:00:50,423 --> 00:00:52,169
at least to begin with,

22
00:00:52,169 --> 00:00:56,648
so that's why the display might look a little wonky in your viewer.

23
00:00:56,648 --> 00:00:57,885
It asks us to authenticate,

24
00:00:57,885 --> 00:01:01,123
and I'm going to authenticate with my local administrator account,

25
00:01:01,123 --> 00:01:03,633
supply my password, press Enter.

26
00:01:03,633 --> 00:01:07,783
And because Windows RE is really a stripped-down version of Windows,

27
00:01:07,783 --> 00:01:12,270
I do have access to the mouse, and we do have this graphical environment,

28
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:12,911
don't we?

29
00:01:12,911 --> 00:01:16,776
And then we can see all of the restore points available on the system,

30
00:01:16,776 --> 00:01:18,536
and we can work our way from there.

31
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:21,920
I'm going to cancel out, and now we're asked again to choose an option.

32
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,982
We can do a regular boot into Windows 10 or go the troubleshoot route.

33
00:01:25,982 --> 00:01:27,903
We're going to go back to Advanced option.

34
00:01:27,903 --> 00:01:32,914
System Image Recovery assumes that you used the Windows 7 tools to do an image,

35
00:01:32,914 --> 00:01:36,043
and I did, in fact, create a system image backup.

36
00:01:36,043 --> 00:01:39,546
It's stored on my F drive, and that's the latest one,

37
00:01:39,546 --> 00:01:43,354
but if you have more than one or one in an alternate

38
00:01:43,354 --> 00:01:45,571
location that Windows can't see right now,

39
00:01:45,571 --> 00:01:47,484
we could choose select a system image.

40
00:01:47,484 --> 00:01:48,851
And if I click Next,

41
00:01:48,851 --> 00:01:51,849
we have the ability to inject custom drivers if we know

42
00:01:51,849 --> 00:01:53,943
that they're not included in that image.

43
00:01:53,943 --> 00:01:55,493
If we go to Advanced,

44
00:01:55,493 --> 00:01:59,221
Automatically restart this computer after the restore is complete,

45
00:01:59,221 --> 00:02:02,333
Automatically check the integrity of the disks.

46
00:02:02,333 --> 00:02:04,021
So we're not going to go any further,

47
00:02:04,021 --> 00:02:07,132
but this is going to set the entire system back in time

48
00:02:07,132 --> 00:02:09,746
to the point at which this was taken,

49
00:02:09,746 --> 00:02:17,067
and it tells us the most recently available is on January 23 at 9:27 AM.

50
00:02:17,067 --> 00:02:19,542
Well that's two days ago, I don't want to do that.

51
00:02:19,542 --> 00:02:22,032
So I'll cancel again, we'll go back to Troubleshoot,

52
00:02:22,032 --> 00:02:25,320
go back to Advanced options, and we have Startup Repair,

53
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,986
Fix problems that keep Windows from loading.

54
00:02:27,986 --> 00:02:32,548
This is going to run a low-level diagnostic and attempt a repair.

55
00:02:32,548 --> 00:02:35,550
As you can see right on your screen, the system restarts,

56
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:38,051
comes back again, 640 x 480 resolution.

57
00:02:38,051 --> 00:02:41,799
I don't think it's going to find anything to fix,

58
00:02:41,799 --> 00:02:44,206
because my system is behaving okay.

59
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:47,440
So it's asking me to log back onto the system.

60
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,002
No problem, I'll re-authenticate.

61
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:52,679
And now we'll go back into diagnostic startup one more time,

62
00:02:52,679 --> 00:02:55,940
but this time we'll do it through the Settings application.

63
00:02:55,940 --> 00:03:00,516
In Windows Settings, I'll type restart and choose advanced startup options.

64
00:03:00,516 --> 00:03:03,530
This brings us to Update & Security Recovery,

65
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:06,795
and under Advanced startup we'll click Restart now.

66
00:03:06,795 --> 00:03:09,042
Again, those assume that we're already in Windows.

67
00:03:09,042 --> 00:03:13,219
You may be in a troubleshooting situation where Windows won't start.

68
00:03:13,219 --> 00:03:13,997
In that case,

69
00:03:13,997 --> 00:03:18,630
you'll want to do a similar action by using your Recovery Drive USB stick,

70
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:21,181
the Windows 10 installation media,

71
00:03:21,181 --> 00:03:24,727
or another method that you're using in your corporation.

72
00:03:24,727 --> 00:03:27,770
Let's come back in Windows RE to Troubleshoot,

73
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:31,927
Advanced options, and our final stop on this journey is Startup Settings,

74
00:03:31,927 --> 00:03:34,383
Restart to change these Windows options,

75
00:03:34,383 --> 00:03:37,398
we'll restart, and here is the Advanced options menu.

76
00:03:37,398 --> 00:03:39,578
And notice that there are three Safe Mode options.

77
00:03:39,578 --> 00:03:42,208
Why would you want to do Safe Mode with networking?

78
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:42,560
Well,

79
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,079
one thing you might want to do is you're doing

80
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:47,548
low-level troubleshooting on the system,

81
00:03:47,548 --> 00:03:51,065
and you want to make sure that minimal drivers are installed,

82
00:03:51,065 --> 00:03:55,153
minimum services are started, but you still need networking access,

83
00:03:55,153 --> 00:03:58,081
maybe to retrieve files from a local server,

84
00:03:58,081 --> 00:04:00,310
download definition files from the internet,

85
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:01,425
and so forth.

86
00:04:01,425 --> 00:04:03,861
If your system may be infected with malware,

87
00:04:03,861 --> 00:04:07,374
don't choose that option because you don't want your system

88
00:04:07,374 --> 00:04:10,051
communicating with the LAN or the internet.

89
00:04:10,051 --> 00:04:14,025
I'm going to choose 4, which is regular garden variety Safe Mode,

90
00:04:14,025 --> 00:04:17,447
and I'll authenticate using my local administrator account.

91
00:04:17,447 --> 00:04:21,035
And, as I already showed you, we have our Safe Mode banners,

92
00:04:21,035 --> 00:04:23,056
actually you're not seeing the taskbar,

93
00:04:23,056 --> 00:04:25,702
it's being cut off in the screen recording,

94
00:04:25,702 --> 00:04:26,952
I apologize about that.

95
00:04:26,952 --> 00:04:30,107
Let me open the Run box and type services.

96
00:04:30,107 --> 00:04:30,534
msc.

97
00:04:30,534 --> 00:04:36,763
And if we sort by status, we see that very few services are running,

98
00:04:36,763 --> 00:04:41,171
just the bare-bones what Windows needs to get running.

99
00:04:41,171 --> 00:04:44,119
Anything else is not loaded, so this is great.

100
00:04:44,119 --> 00:04:47,499
If you have a service that was set to automatic startup,

101
00:04:47,499 --> 00:04:50,702
and it was causing your system to crash,

102
00:04:50,702 --> 00:04:55,005
hang, or otherwise malfunction, this is your opportunity to come into that,

103
00:04:55,005 --> 00:04:57,030
and perhaps set it to Disabled,

104
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:00,447
and make sure that it won't start the next time you start your system.

105
00:05:00,447 --> 00:05:03,595
It allows you to come in to Add/Remove programs.

106
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:07,098
If you have software that's giving you problems or Windows

107
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:09,485
Updates that are giving you problems that are preventing

108
00:05:09,485 --> 00:05:12,535
you from getting into Windows, you can come in and uninstall those.

109
00:05:12,535 --> 00:05:17,461
And then if we just do a normal restart by using the power button restart,

110
00:05:17,461 --> 00:05:20,162
the next startup will be normal boot,

111
00:05:20,162 --> 00:05:28,000
and we'll be able to log into Windows normally, and hopefully everything is all fine and all ducky.
