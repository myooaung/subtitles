00:00:00,507 --> 00:00:03,831
For further learning in the Pluralsight library,

2
00:00:03,831 --> 00:00:06,783
start by looking at Mike Halsey's course,

3
00:00:06,783 --> 00:00:08,888
Providing Troubleshooting Support for Windows Users.

4
00:00:08,888 --> 00:00:12,470
I like his course because he injects a lot of soft skills.

5
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:16,450
The ability to know technical troubleshooting in Windows is great,

6
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:19,987
but also the ability to put the people you're helping at ease.

7
00:00:19,987 --> 00:00:22,761
They're likely afraid that they did something wrong and

8
00:00:22,761 --> 00:00:26,037
their system is hopelessly broken, they may have lost files.

9
00:00:26,037 --> 00:00:26,927
Soft skills, really,

10
00:00:26,927 --> 00:00:31,032
will go so much farther in your career if you have good

11
00:00:31,032 --> 00:00:32,737
interpersonal communication skills.

12
00:00:32,737 --> 00:00:36,383
There's also Mike's course Troubleshooting Difficult Problems in Windows.

13
00:00:36,383 --> 00:00:38,697
He gets into the deep waters pretty quickly,

14
00:00:38,697 --> 00:00:41,744
it's very intense, but the course is really good for you,

15
00:00:41,744 --> 00:00:44,157
because, again, regardless of what you're doing with Windows 10,

16
00:00:44,157 --> 00:00:46,985
you've got to be at least somewhat interested in technical

17
00:00:46,985 --> 00:00:49,120
stuff to be studying this course anyway.

18
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,322
This is going to be a good course for you to broaden and

19
00:00:52,322 --> 00:00:53,753
deepen your troubleshooting skills.

20
00:00:53,753 --> 00:00:55,879
You might want to look at troubleshooting courses,

21
00:00:55,879 --> 00:00:57,548
just do a search at Pluralsight.

22
00:00:57,548 --> 00:00:57,890
com,

23
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:06,000
because we have a lot of excellent training on developing a good system troubleshooting methodology.
