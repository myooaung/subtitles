00:00:02.107 --> 00:00:04.741
In this module, we're going to look at hardware management.

2
00:00:04.741 --> 00:00:08.478
You might have wondered, Tim, aren't you going to discuss Device Manager?

3
00:00:08.478 --> 00:00:11.388
Actually I am, but not until the second demo.

4
00:00:11.388 --> 00:00:13.223
For now I want to start with system information,

5
00:00:13.223 --> 00:00:17.017
and the way that I normally get to that is to right-click the Start button,

6
00:00:17.017 --> 00:00:19.053
go to Run, and type msinfo32.

7
00:00:19.053 --> 00:00:22.665
It's one of those muscle memory things for me.

8
00:00:22.665 --> 00:00:25.094
The System Information tool hasn't changed much over

9
00:00:25.094 --> 00:00:28.578
the years to be honest with you, and that's a good thing I think.

10
00:00:28.578 --> 00:00:32.061
What we have is a System Summary by default that has

11
00:00:32.061 --> 00:00:33.882
all sorts of good juicy information,

12
00:00:33.882 --> 00:00:36.658
a lot of which would be a little challenging to

13
00:00:36.658 --> 00:00:38.458
find otherwise within Windows 10.

14
00:00:38.458 --> 00:00:39.178
For example,

15
00:00:39.178 --> 00:00:43.103
how do you know whether your motherboard is using

16
00:00:43.103 --> 00:00:46.085
UEFI firmware or the legacy BIOS?

17
00:00:46.085 --> 00:00:49.454
Well it can tell us right here in the BIOS Mode property.

18
00:00:49.454 --> 00:00:51.656
Well we're leaving nothing to the imagination.

19
00:00:51.656 --> 00:00:56.032
Actually, instead of going to winver and the System Control Panel,

20
00:00:56.032 --> 00:00:59.677
we can see here the OS Name and edition and the Version.

21
00:00:59.677 --> 00:01:04.512
This is giving us the dot version, not the friendly 1709.

22
00:01:04.512 --> 00:01:07.525
We get an inventory of our time and date settings,

23
00:01:07.525 --> 00:01:12.746
the amount of physical memory we have, where our virtual memory file is,

24
00:01:12.746 --> 00:01:18.062
some bits on TPM status, whether you have a trusted platform module or not,

25
00:01:18.062 --> 00:01:20.833
and that's all just in the System Summary.

26
00:01:20.833 --> 00:01:22.738
Notice that we have Hardware Resources.

27
00:01:22.738 --> 00:01:26.730
There was a time, many years ago in earlier versions of Windows,

28
00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.402
where if you were, for instance, installing a new card,

29
00:01:30.402 --> 00:01:33.099
maybe an ISA or a PCI card,

30
00:01:33.099 --> 00:01:37.647
ISA is a bus architecture that's long since gone the way of the dodo,

31
00:01:37.647 --> 00:01:40.272
where you would actually have to worry about things

32
00:01:40.272 --> 00:01:43.471
like interrupt request values, memory and I/O addresses,

33
00:01:43.471 --> 00:01:46.523
and make sure that there's no conflicts.

34
00:01:46.523 --> 00:01:50.873
I haven't had to intervene at that level with hardware for many years,

35
00:01:50.873 --> 00:01:52.939
and I think that's a good thing.

36
00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:55.386
Components is broken down by subsystem, Display,

37
00:01:55.386 --> 00:01:59.273
Sound, Input, Network, as you can see here.

38
00:01:59.273 --> 00:02:02.753
You'll see references to specific drivers and versions.

39
00:02:02.753 --> 00:02:06.644
In the case of Display, you can see what our display Resolution is.

40
00:02:06.644 --> 00:02:11.187
Here as I said is which driver is currently being used, along with its version.

41
00:02:11.187 --> 00:02:13.830
And then we get from hardware into software where

42
00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.294
we get a run of System Drivers, Environment Variables,

43
00:02:18.294 --> 00:02:21.249
Network Connections, even Running Tasks,

44
00:02:21.249 --> 00:02:25.620
as of the snapshot when this report was generated.

45
00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.176
Now if those are some things,

46
00:02:27.176 --> 00:02:30.999
those are some categories that I don't remember in earlier versions of Windows.

47
00:02:30.999 --> 00:02:34.604
So we know that Microsoft is actively developing this tool.

48
00:02:34.604 --> 00:02:37.000
You'll notice that in the Find,

49
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.858
we can do a quick filter on any keyword or process name.

50
00:02:41.858 --> 00:02:44.751
There is so much data in System Information.

51
00:02:44.751 --> 00:02:46.163
Now check this out.

52
00:02:46.163 --> 00:02:47.575
This is incredibly cool.

53
00:02:47.575 --> 00:02:51.508
It's one thing to be able to look at system information on your local computer,

54
00:02:51.508 --> 00:02:55.388
but you can also, depending upon how your network is set up,

55
00:02:55.388 --> 00:02:59.528
open the View menu and connect to a remote machine on your network.

56
00:02:59.528 --> 00:03:02.942
In an Active Directory domain environment, this is pretty easy.

57
00:03:02.942 --> 00:03:08.156
I'm going to choose dc1, which is a domain controller running on this network,

58
00:03:08.156 --> 00:03:12.241
and of course there's many reasons and factors why the

59
00:03:12.241 --> 00:03:14.610
communication might not take place.

60
00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.927
Firewall might be the most common one.

61
00:03:17.927 --> 00:03:22.832
So know that that capacity exists for remote administration, that's nice.

62
00:03:22.832 --> 00:03:26.439
Something else I want you to see is that we can save our

63
00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:29.480
system information to an NFO file, N-F-O.

64
00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.638
This is devbox, and I'll save it on my desktop.

65
00:03:33.638 --> 00:03:37.757
And notice it's going through everything and putting it in a special

66
00:03:37.757 --> 00:03:41.422
format file that can be parsed by system information.

67
00:03:41.422 --> 00:03:45.336
So the idea here is if on a remote machine you're unable to

68
00:03:45.336 --> 00:03:47.944
connect to it directly over the network,

69
00:03:47.944 --> 00:03:52.402
you could instruct the user or whoever is operating that local computer,

70
00:03:52.402 --> 00:03:55.795
to generate an NFO file and get it to you,

71
00:03:55.795 --> 00:03:59.933
and you can load it into your installation of System Information.

72
00:03:59.933 --> 00:04:03.242
Now to do that, we would just do File, Open,

73
00:04:03.242 --> 00:04:05.614
select the NFO file, and there it is.

74
00:04:05.614 --> 00:04:09.882
So now it's showing us that we're seeing a System Summary from an NFO file.

75
00:04:09.882 --> 00:04:13.835
Let me close that file to come back to the local machine.

76
00:04:13.835 --> 00:04:17.048
Something else we can do is export this list.

77
00:04:17.048 --> 00:04:21.146
Now, this is going to come out as a comma-separated value list.

78
00:04:21.146 --> 00:04:22.914
So if I do report.

79
00:04:22.914 --> 00:04:25.037
csv, save it to my desktop,

80
00:04:25.037 --> 00:04:30.723
again it's going to drag through the entire list of tracked components here.

81
00:04:30.723 --> 00:04:34.216
In case you're wondering what that delimited file looks like,

82
00:04:34.216 --> 00:04:36.985
here you see it loaded into Excel,

83
00:04:36.985 --> 00:04:41.995
and it's just a great big list of two columns divided into sections.

84
00:04:41.995 --> 00:04:45.306
Okay, so that's the bottom line with System Information.

85
00:04:45.306 --> 00:04:48.958
There's a command line version of that by the way.

86
00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:52.206
Let me open up an elevated PowerShell console.

87
00:04:52.206 --> 00:04:54.065
It's called systeminfo.

88
00:04:54.065 --> 00:05:00.694
And if you run systeminfo space /?, that gives you the syntax help.

89
00:05:00.694 --> 00:05:02.986
And there's some useful options here.

90
00:05:02.986 --> 00:05:09.382
Being able to generate the result in different formats, table, list, or CSV.

91
00:05:09.382 --> 00:05:13.520
You can specify a remote system, and even alternate credentials.

92
00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.072
So systeminfo /S would be the local machine,

93
00:05:17.072 --> 00:05:22.355
devbox, and if I want to create a CSV file with no headers,

94
00:05:22.355 --> 00:05:29.105
it shows us some output on the screen, but also let me do a dir *.

95
00:05:29.105 --> 00:05:29.564
csv.

96
00:05:29.564 --> 00:05:33.742
Huh, it didn't give me a file in that output.

97
00:05:33.742 --> 00:05:37.627
There's some more info that I probably need to look into that,

98
00:05:37.627 --> 00:05:39.633
but anyway, you get the idea.

99
00:05:39.633 --> 00:05:41.836
The beautiful thing about the systeminfo.

100
00:05:41.836 --> 00:05:44.867
exe command is that this is scriptable.

101
00:05:44.867 --> 00:05:49.161
So if you don't have the money or expertise or time to implement a

102
00:05:49.161 --> 00:05:51.702
configuration management platform like System Center,

103
00:05:51.702 --> 00:05:56.080
you could use PowerShell to run systeminfo against N number

104
00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:03.000
of remote machines and generate reports for each one of them in any format that you want.
