1
00:00:04.957 --> 00:00:07.960
we can get this, it's a Microsoft Store app,

2
00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:12.526
and the idea here is you can file questions with Microsoft,

3
00:00:12.526 --> 00:00:16.312
giving them feedback, just your opinion on certain features,

4
00:00:16.312 --> 00:00:20.207
or ask questions and interact with some of the product teams directly.

5
00:00:20.207 --> 00:00:21.876
Now that's pretty cool, isn't it?

6
00:00:21.876 --> 00:00:25.225
Notice that in order to use this you're going to need to authenticate,

7
00:00:25.225 --> 00:00:28.856
and you might remember a couple of modules ago in the

8
00:00:28.856 --> 00:00:32.260
user setting I added a couple accounts, my Microsoft account,

9
00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.948
and also a work and school account so I can easily integrate

10
00:00:35.948 --> 00:00:39.070
those with just a click of the button, that's convenient,

11
00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:39.785
isn't it?

12
00:00:39.785 --> 00:00:42.420
This is going to redraw the Feedback Hub page.

13
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.833
We have to agree to the privacy statement.

14
00:00:44.833 --> 00:00:48.347
If we open the navigation menu here, we have Home,

15
00:00:48.347 --> 00:00:50.994
Feedback, Announcements, Quests, and User profile.

16
00:00:50.994 --> 00:00:55.506
This is a good way to interact with the Windows 10 product team,

17
00:00:55.506 --> 00:00:56.552
and also other users.

18
00:00:56.552 --> 00:01:00.994
It has a bit of a learning curve to it, but it's not too bad.

19
00:01:00.994 --> 00:01:04.071
If you're familiar with discussion forums and posts online,

20
00:01:04.071 --> 00:01:05.625
then you know all about it.

21
00:01:05.625 --> 00:01:08.887
It looks like we'll have to adjust our privacy settings.

22
00:01:08.887 --> 00:01:13.515
I clicked the Feedback navigation link here, and it says we'll need to allow.

23
00:01:13.515 --> 00:01:16.749
This reminds me a little bit of when we did Cortana towards

24
00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:21.093
the beginning of the course we had to give Cortana certain

25
00:01:21.093 --> 00:01:23.082
permissions in order to do any work,

26
00:01:23.082 --> 00:01:28.458
and it looks like to take advantage of the Feedback Hub we're under Settings,

27
00:01:28.458 --> 00:01:30.860
Privacy, Feedback & Diagnostics.

28
00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.877
We have to turn on the setting, Windows will collect minimum diagnostic data,

29
00:01:34.877 --> 00:01:38.065
and then Windows should ask for my feedback.

30
00:01:38.065 --> 00:01:41.827
You can put that from Never all the way up to Automatic.

31
00:01:41.827 --> 00:01:44.073
And just to click through here,

32
00:01:44.073 --> 00:01:47.576
the privacy settings allows you to customize diagnostic

33
00:01:47.576 --> 00:01:51.728
settings at the application level whether or not you want apps

34
00:01:51.728 --> 00:01:54.091
to be allowed to run in the background,

35
00:01:54.091 --> 00:01:57.758
whether automatic file downloads are allowed or blocked,

36
00:01:57.758 --> 00:01:58.216
etc.

37
00:01:58.216 --> 00:02:01.087
So that'll allow us to get deeper into the Feedback Hub.

38
00:02:01.087 --> 00:02:04.103
The last stop on this little trolley ride through built-in

39
00:02:04.103 --> 00:02:06.806
troubleshooting tools in Windows 10 is Event Viewer.

40
00:02:06.806 --> 00:02:11.883
I'm going to open up the Run prompt and type eventvwr.

41
00:02:11.883 --> 00:02:12.345
msc.

42
00:02:12.345 --> 00:02:14.122
That's a fast way to open it up.

43
00:02:14.122 --> 00:02:14.566
Of course,

44
00:02:14.566 --> 00:02:19.097
you can go through the Start menu and just type Event Viewer just as well.

45
00:02:19.097 --> 00:02:21.439
I normally turn off the right pane.

46
00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:24.603
Notice that the Microsoft Management Console has controls for

47
00:02:24.603 --> 00:02:27.888
turning the left and right panes on or off.

48
00:02:27.888 --> 00:02:31.045
I don't like the right pane because it robs screen real estate,

49
00:02:31.045 --> 00:02:36.333
and quite honestly, you can get to all those commands by right-clicking anyway.

50
00:02:36.333 --> 00:02:38.131
Now there is a lot to Event Viewer.

51
00:02:38.131 --> 00:02:40.985
I suggest you look for Event Viewer content in the

52
00:02:40.985 --> 00:02:43.620
Pluralsight library to get a full rundown,

53
00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.594
but the bottom line here is that you can pick a log.

54
00:02:45.594 --> 00:02:47.152
There's a lot of logs.

55
00:02:47.152 --> 00:02:49.820
The most common ones with Windows are Application,

56
00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.765
Security, Setup, and System,

57
00:02:51.765 --> 00:02:54.909
but depending upon what software you have installed

58
00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:56.408
there will be additional logs.

59
00:02:56.408 --> 00:02:59.757
I have a third-party product called Netwrix Auditor installed,

60
00:02:59.757 --> 00:03:02.501
and it creates its own log to track events.

61
00:03:02.501 --> 00:03:05.288
I have SQL Server and Microsoft Office, but again,

62
00:03:05.288 --> 00:03:09.467
to get back just to the operating system events you can sort these

63
00:03:09.467 --> 00:03:12.385
lists by clicking the column heading to see,

64
00:03:12.385 --> 00:03:14.710
for instance, the most recent events.

65
00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:17.871
When you look at the actions of the event down here,

66
00:03:17.871 --> 00:03:20.302
there's a Datils pane, which is a summary,

67
00:03:20.302 --> 00:03:23.503
and then we have, depending upon what the event is,

68
00:03:23.503 --> 00:03:24.478
more details available.

69
00:03:24.478 --> 00:03:29.197
Now, the number of events I have on this system is over 4, 000.

70
00:03:29.197 --> 00:03:31.350
That's very difficult to parse through.

71
00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.950
If you're looking for a particular event ID,

72
00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:36.352
for instance, you'll want to do a search,

73
00:03:36.352 --> 00:03:39.112
so you can filter the current log looking only,

74
00:03:39.112 --> 00:03:40.545
for instance, for errors,

75
00:03:40.545 --> 00:03:45.098
and instead of all Event IDs you can pass in a range or

76
00:03:45.098 --> 00:03:47.503
a specific one separated by a comma.

77
00:03:47.503 --> 00:03:50.013
I'll just leave the filter on Error.

78
00:03:50.013 --> 00:03:53.789
And by using the error system, and then running finds,

79
00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:57.040
you should be able to get much closer.

80
00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:03.490
In this case it looks like I filtered over 4, 300 entries down to 375.

81
00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:05.592
This is a skill that you develop in time.

82
00:04:05.592 --> 00:04:09.540
It's just one of those learning curve things that you'll need to build.

83
00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.053
Event Viewer MMC is cool,

84
00:04:11.053 --> 00:04:13.900
because you can right-click the node and connect to

85
00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.721
another computer in your environment,

86
00:04:15.721 --> 00:04:18.344
the idea here being from your administrative workstation

87
00:04:18.344 --> 00:04:22.056
you can reach out and touch the event log of managed

88
00:04:22.056 --> 00:04:24.146
servers or other desktop devices,

89
00:04:24.146 --> 00:04:29.283
as long as you have administrator privileges on those remote machines.

90
00:04:29.283 --> 00:04:32.591
Remember, I want you to think in terns of remote management,

91
00:04:32.591 --> 00:04:35.002
because all but the smallest environments should be

92
00:04:35.002 --> 00:04:42.000
organized in either a peer-to-peer network or an honest to goodness Active Directory domain.
