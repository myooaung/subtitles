00:00:01.769 --> 00:00:06.065
Now let's finish up with the migration scenario.

2
00:00:06.065 --> 00:00:09.452
The migration use case is you're moving or your customer is

3
00:00:09.452 --> 00:00:12.455
moving from one piece of hardware to another,

4
00:00:12.455 --> 00:00:12.840
okay?

5
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.929
In-place upgrade you're assuming the same machine.

6
00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.287
The migration case is maybe in business you're on a three 3 year lease

7
00:00:19.287 --> 00:00:22.623
cycle and it's time for a new fleet of computers,

8
00:00:22.623 --> 00:00:26.950
so those computers may already have Windows 10 pre-installed and ready to go.

9
00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:32.544
Now how do you get user preferences and their document data to that new machine?

10
00:00:32.544 --> 00:00:34.068
Now the preferences bit is important.

11
00:00:34.068 --> 00:00:36.107
It's one thing to give them their documents,

12
00:00:36.107 --> 00:00:39.819
and that's fine, it's another to give them the applications that they expect,

13
00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:40.865
that's fine too,

14
00:00:40.865 --> 00:00:44.299
but you're users are going to complain if the new

15
00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:46.843
environment differs from their old one, and obviously,

16
00:00:46.843 --> 00:00:50.105
if you're going from like 7 to 10 there's going to be a

17
00:00:50.105 --> 00:00:52.753
significant learning curve there right out of the gate.

18
00:00:52.753 --> 00:00:57.027
If the user has his or her preferred desktop wallpaper and

19
00:00:57.027 --> 00:01:00.123
mouse pointer size and Windows settings that migration's going

20
00:01:00.123 --> 00:01:02.469
to be much easier for them to handle.

21
00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:06.165
Microsoft, as I said earlier, has a number of migration tools.

22
00:01:06.165 --> 00:01:09.345
Now they used to have, Microsoft that is,

23
00:01:09.345 --> 00:01:13.292
they sold a cross-over USB cable called the Windows Easy

24
00:01:13.292 --> 00:01:16.035
Transfer cable with a funny acronym name,

25
00:01:16.035 --> 00:01:16.427
WET.

26
00:01:16.427 --> 00:01:18.451
That's not supported in Windows 10.

27
00:01:18.451 --> 00:01:23.537
In prior versions of Windows you could do a migration on a PC by PC basis

28
00:01:23.537 --> 00:01:26.472
by connecting them on that double headed USB cable,

29
00:01:26.472 --> 00:01:31.108
and you would run the Windows Easy Transfer application built-in to Windows,

30
00:01:31.108 --> 00:01:33.540
previous versions that is, to transfer,

31
00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.392
do a live transfer of the settings from one machine to the other,

32
00:01:37.392 --> 00:01:40.004
and when I say settings I'm talking about the full

33
00:01:40.004 --> 00:01:43.435
user environment; their preferences, their application settings,

34
00:01:43.435 --> 00:01:45.020
and their files.

35
00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.087
In Windows 10 Microsoft is partnered with the company LapLink.

36
00:01:49.087 --> 00:01:51.390
LapLink has been around for a long, long time,

37
00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.808
and they have a product called PCmover Express,

38
00:01:53.808 --> 00:01:56.463
and they even have their own cable.

39
00:01:56.463 --> 00:01:59.136
If you're familiar with network cables you'll recognize

40
00:01:59.136 --> 00:02:01.759
that as an Ethernet crossover cable.

41
00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:05.621
Now Microsoft was offering heavy discounts on this tool.

42
00:02:05.621 --> 00:02:08.101
You're going to have to go to the site and check for

43
00:02:08.101 --> 00:02:11.093
yourself as of when you're watching this movie to see what

44
00:02:11.093 --> 00:02:13.295
kind of deal you can get on it.

45
00:02:13.295 --> 00:02:15.506
It's not as clean as Windows Easy Transfer,

46
00:02:15.506 --> 00:02:19.017
especially in terms of the cable issue, but it is what it is.

47
00:02:19.017 --> 00:02:21.431
PCmover is the name of the product.

48
00:02:21.431 --> 00:02:24.659
USMT is a collection of command line tools that

49
00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:26.916
stands for User State Migration Tools.

50
00:02:26.916 --> 00:02:29.390
The two tools are ScanState and LoadState.

51
00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.585
ScanState you run on the source computer,

52
00:02:31.585 --> 00:02:34.467
and it copies off all of the user environment,

53
00:02:34.467 --> 00:02:39.367
preferably to a network location, and then you run LoadState on the new computer,

54
00:02:39.367 --> 00:02:42.996
and download those settings and applications to the new system.

55
00:02:42.996 --> 00:02:44.086
This is scriptable.

56
00:02:44.086 --> 00:02:44.649
In fact,

57
00:02:44.649 --> 00:02:47.465
I have friends who do this every day in configuration

58
00:02:47.465 --> 00:02:50.365
management when they're migrating systems,

59
00:02:50.365 --> 00:02:51.782
dozens, hundreds of systems,

60
00:02:51.782 --> 00:02:54.958
you need to be able to script and automate these tasks,

61
00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:59.620
otherwise, you're going to be wasting lots and lots of time unnecessarily.

62
00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.594
Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager,

63
00:03:01.594 --> 00:03:05.954
or SCCM as it's called, is an enterprised config management tool.

64
00:03:05.954 --> 00:03:08.338
You can do anything OS related.

65
00:03:08.338 --> 00:03:09.973
New operating system deployments,

66
00:03:09.973 --> 00:03:13.533
you can do in-place upgrades on multiple systems,

67
00:03:13.533 --> 00:03:15.748
you can do migrations.

68
00:03:15.748 --> 00:03:19.624
It actually ties into the USMT tools.

69
00:03:19.624 --> 00:03:21.876
The Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit,

70
00:03:21.876 --> 00:03:22.627
the ADK,

71
00:03:22.627 --> 00:03:27.621
is a free download and a big download that gives you that application

72
00:03:27.621 --> 00:03:29.935
compatibility toolkit that I told you about earlier,

73
00:03:29.935 --> 00:03:33.178
but you can also download the User State Migration Tool,

74
00:03:33.178 --> 00:03:35.967
as you see highlighted in the screenshot.

75
00:03:35.967 --> 00:03:39.908
Unfortunately, Microsoft no longer makes the USMT available separately,

76
00:03:39.908 --> 00:03:43.752
so you have to download the ADK, and it's a big download,

77
00:03:43.752 --> 00:03:44.156
6.

78
00:03:44.156 --> 00:03:48.600
7GB if you want everything, and that's the Windows 10 version,

79
00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.460
but notice the checkbox controls.

80
00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:55.120
So you can just download the USMT this way if you want to.

81
00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.863
Note that the ADK is operating system specific.

82
00:03:57.863 --> 00:04:03.427
Make sure you get the ADK for Windows 10 and not the one for, say, Windows 8.

83
00:04:03.427 --> 00:04:05.878
1 or Windows 7.

84
00:04:05.878 --> 00:04:08.629
A little more on the User State Migration Tools.

85
00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:09.930
These are command line tools,

86
00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.700
so if you're allergic to the command line I suggest you get over that,

87
00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:13.978
really.

88
00:04:13.978 --> 00:04:18.781
I say that with tough love because IT has been moving the way towards

89
00:04:18.781 --> 00:04:20.920
administrative automation for several years now.

90
00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.276
This is not PowerShell.

91
00:04:22.276 --> 00:04:25.288
This is an old-fashioned executable syntax.

92
00:04:25.288 --> 00:04:27.625
You don't need to know all the details of it,

93
00:04:27.625 --> 00:04:30.636
but basically what we're doing in this command is we're saying,

94
00:04:30.636 --> 00:04:33.955
scan the computer, and pick up all of the user data,

95
00:04:33.955 --> 00:04:38.240
put it on a network server called server in a folder called mystore,

96
00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:43.469
and then we're customizing the process by pathing out to a number of

97
00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:46.285
extensible markup language or XML config files.

98
00:04:46.285 --> 00:04:48.091
You can customize and do exclusions.

99
00:04:48.091 --> 00:04:52.298
I want a migrate these apps, but not those apps because we've already,

100
00:04:52.298 --> 00:04:54.524
say, got them installed on the target computer.

101
00:04:54.524 --> 00:04:55.805
We want to install these docs,

102
00:04:55.805 --> 00:05:00.513
but we want to exclude MP3 audio because that's not allowed in the company.

103
00:05:00.513 --> 00:05:02.035
You see what I mean?

104
00:05:02.035 --> 00:05:04.165
The v switch determines the verbosity level.

105
00:05:04.165 --> 00:05:05.765
Thirteen is maximum verbosity.

106
00:05:05.765 --> 00:05:10.044
When you're doing scripts like this you want the program to kick out,

107
00:05:10.044 --> 00:05:10.580
in general,

108
00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:13.855
you want it to kick out as much feedback as possible because

109
00:05:13.855 --> 00:05:17.761
if something goes wrong you want the verbose output to better

110
00:05:17.761 --> 00:05:22.878
isolate it and isolate it more, I was going to say more faster,

111
00:05:22.878 --> 00:05:24.265
let's just say faster.

112
00:05:24.265 --> 00:05:25.441
LoadState, as I said,

113
00:05:25.441 --> 00:05:29.141
happens on the target system where you pull down the configuration specifying,

114
00:05:29.141 --> 00:05:31.600
it looks like, all of the parameters,

115
00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:37.062
except for our verbose log file name we're calling it load.

116
00:05:37.062 --> 00:05:39.048
log instead of scan.

117
00:05:39.048 --> 00:05:42.415
Many times developers will manufacture a Graphical User

118
00:05:42.415 --> 00:05:46.093
Interface or GUI frontend for a command line tool.

119
00:05:46.093 --> 00:05:48.523
USMT GUI is one such example.

120
00:05:48.523 --> 00:05:50.405
Check the exercise files for the link.

121
00:05:50.405 --> 00:05:53.981
I just wanted to show you this that it is possible to get

122
00:05:53.981 --> 00:05:55.956
around having to know all that syntax.

123
00:05:55.956 --> 00:05:58.668
What this tool does is allow you to use controls,

124
00:05:58.668 --> 00:06:02.173
as you see, graphical controls, to determine what you want to do,

125
00:06:02.173 --> 00:06:05.101
and then it fills in the syntax for you to use,

126
00:06:05.101 --> 00:06:14.000
and even allows you to run it if you have the ScanState and LoadState tools installed on the local system.
