00:00:02.181 --> 00:00:05.269
Service accounts are managed graphically in the

2
00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:07.034
Services Microsoft Management Console.

3
00:00:07.034 --> 00:00:10.325
Of course, you can always do this through PowerShell as well,

4
00:00:10.325 --> 00:00:12.027
and you'll find that oftentimes,

5
00:00:12.027 --> 00:00:17.284
most often when you install an application that in turn installs one or more

6
00:00:17.284 --> 00:00:21.280
services they use the local system account identity by default.

7
00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.142
You'll find that in Windows there's a number of identities.

8
00:00:25.142 --> 00:00:28.373
They're called identities as opposed to user accounts to

9
00:00:28.373 --> 00:00:32.056
separate the fact that these identities do not show up in

10
00:00:32.056 --> 00:00:36.354
your Local Users and Groups lists, and that they're managed entirely by Windows.

11
00:00:36.354 --> 00:00:39.537
You don't interact with them other than specifying them

12
00:00:39.537 --> 00:00:41.749
from time to time for your services.

13
00:00:41.749 --> 00:00:45.762
There's Local Service, Local System, and Network Service.

14
00:00:45.762 --> 00:00:49.050
The two local accounts have various levels of

15
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.463
built-in privileges on the Local System,

16
00:00:51.463 --> 00:00:55.264
and Network Service allows the potential for a service to

17
00:00:55.264 --> 00:00:57.886
reach across the network or even the internet.

18
00:00:57.886 --> 00:01:00.970
Now on the right hand side of this slide I'm showing one

19
00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:06.826
of the Adobe Creative Suite services, it's called AdobeUpdateService,

20
00:01:06.826 --> 00:01:09.604
and I didn't set it to use Local System account,

21
00:01:09.604 --> 00:01:11.060
it just is defaulting there,

22
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.514
and so therefore you don't have to supply a password,

23
00:01:14.514 --> 00:01:17.546
and Local System's a fairly high privileged account.

24
00:01:17.546 --> 00:01:19.715
Sometimes, especially on server systems,

25
00:01:19.715 --> 00:01:24.065
you'll need to use a dedicated account that you create.

26
00:01:24.065 --> 00:01:27.556
Typically it would be an inactive directory domain.

27
00:01:27.556 --> 00:01:29.885
You would create a domain user account,

28
00:01:29.885 --> 00:01:32.970
and then you can specify that service account specifically.

29
00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.335
You see that This account option in this properties sheet,

30
00:01:36.335 --> 00:01:39.897
and the Browse button that allows you to browse the directory if,

31
00:01:39.897 --> 00:01:43.181
of course, you're connected to an Active Directory domain.

32
00:01:43.181 --> 00:01:43.527
Nonetheless,

33
00:01:43.527 --> 00:01:46.642
don't make the mistake of defaulting to a domain

34
00:01:46.642 --> 00:01:49.301
administrator privilege for your service accounts.

35
00:01:49.301 --> 00:01:53.097
That used to be fairly general practice because the idea was

36
00:01:53.097 --> 00:01:55.325
you've got a line of business application,

37
00:01:55.325 --> 00:01:58.879
maybe an email server, that everybody in the business relies on,

38
00:01:58.879 --> 00:02:00.848
so you need it to work.

39
00:02:00.848 --> 00:02:04.435
If you supply an administrative account as the service account the idea

40
00:02:04.435 --> 00:02:07.239
is you shouldn't run into any permission problems,

41
00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:09.420
and while that's true, in general,

42
00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.115
there's also the profound security implication that if malware were

43
00:02:13.115 --> 00:02:17.540
to hijack that account it will wreck havoc because it will have

44
00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.302
permissions up to and including all permissions granted to that

45
00:02:21.302 --> 00:02:22.911
administrative service account identity,

46
00:02:22.911 --> 00:02:23.715
you see?

47
00:02:23.715 --> 00:02:24.246
Another point,

48
00:02:24.246 --> 00:02:27.368
when you create your own service account in Active Directory make

49
00:02:27.368 --> 00:02:30.286
sure you never use that for interactive logon.

50
00:02:30.286 --> 00:02:37.000
In other words, a human should never use a service account. It's used only by processes and code.
