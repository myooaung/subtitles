First, the library.

2
00:00:04.216 --> 00:00:10.294
The library system's been around in Windows Client for quite a while.

3
00:00:10.294 --> 00:00:14.470
I think Windows 7 was when Microsoft first gave us this.

4
00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:16.453
In the File Explorer windows,

5
00:00:16.453 --> 00:00:19.016
you've probably noticed a component in the tree

6
00:00:19.016 --> 00:00:23.614
that you can turn on and turn off, I'll show you in the demo how to do that,

7
00:00:23.614 --> 00:00:25.523
that breaks it down by media type.

8
00:00:25.523 --> 00:00:29.576
These are just default libraries that you can do with what you wish,

9
00:00:29.576 --> 00:00:33.357
and you can add additional libraries to suit your business needs.

10
00:00:33.357 --> 00:00:38.208
What's confusing to many long-term Windows users is that by clicking Documents,

11
00:00:38.208 --> 00:00:41.656
it seems to take you into your Home folder,

12
00:00:41.656 --> 00:00:47.433
which is C:\\users\Username\Documents, but that's not exactly true.

13
00:00:47.433 --> 00:00:49.954
As you can see in the screenshot here,

14
00:00:49.954 --> 00:00:53.528
the Documents library actually consists of one or more locations.

15
00:00:53.528 --> 00:00:57.858
For instance, I have the OneDrive client application on this workstation,

16
00:00:57.858 --> 00:01:01.798
so it's embracing not only my Home folder documents,

17
00:01:01.798 --> 00:01:04.330
but also my OneDrive documents.

18
00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.765
So what I want to say is that the library is essentially a collection of

19
00:01:08.765 --> 00:01:14.724
virtual folder locations which can actually aggregate one or more spots on

20
00:01:14.724 --> 00:01:18.962
your local system and/or other systems on your network.

21
00:01:18.962 --> 00:01:21.769
It's a very convenient way to aggregate related files,

22
00:01:21.769 --> 00:01:24.789
and then you can take advantage of, for instance,

23
00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:27.404
the File Explorer's Search capability to quickly

24
00:01:27.404 --> 00:01:35.000
locate the documents that you need. Let's get right into a demo so I can show you how this works.
