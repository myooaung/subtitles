00:00:02.156 --> 00:00:02.879
In this demonstration,

2
00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:05.541
I want to show you some of those so-called special

3
00:00:05.541 --> 00:00:07.997
purpose Control Panel settings items.

4
00:00:07.997 --> 00:00:10.417
First, there was accessibility and one thing again,

5
00:00:10.417 --> 00:00:13.474
you can just take advantage of click search as I call

6
00:00:13.474 --> 00:00:15.585
it or you don't even need to click,

7
00:00:15.585 --> 00:00:19.770
just hit the Windows key on your keyboard and start to type accessibility,

8
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.726
it's kind of a tough word to type actually,

9
00:00:22.726 --> 00:00:26.229
and notice that there is an option to go to the

10
00:00:26.229 --> 00:00:27.746
accessibility settings Control Panel, again,

11
00:00:27.746 --> 00:00:29.213
that icon looks old school,

12
00:00:29.213 --> 00:00:34.077
and instead of it being an outline like we have in the Windows 10 settings app,

13
00:00:34.077 --> 00:00:35.946
we have the full color icon.

14
00:00:35.946 --> 00:00:39.765
And sure enough, that option takes us into the Ease of Access center,

15
00:00:39.765 --> 00:00:42.496
and again, we don't need to go through every option.

16
00:00:42.496 --> 00:00:45.659
I have in the exercise files a pointer to where you

17
00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:47.097
can learn about every option.

18
00:00:47.097 --> 00:00:51.151
My goal is to make sure you understand where to find these options and then

19
00:00:51.151 --> 00:00:55.734
it's your homework to learn how to use them and then to be aware of when to

20
00:00:55.734 --> 00:00:58.236
use them when you're helping your customers,

21
00:00:58.236 --> 00:01:00.144
relatives, friends, coworkers, employees,

22
00:01:00.144 --> 00:01:00.661
etc.

23
00:01:00.661 --> 00:01:03.245
Let's again, try that again,

24
00:01:03.245 --> 00:01:07.350
typing accessibility and there are some Ease of Access settings

25
00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.878
here that use the settings transparent icon,

26
00:01:09.878 --> 00:01:13.562
it doesn't matter which one you click basically because it's going to

27
00:01:13.562 --> 00:01:16.062
take you to the settings Ease of Access center,

28
00:01:16.062 --> 00:01:16.908
and once again,

29
00:01:16.908 --> 00:01:19.952
the way you navigate this is just choosing which category

30
00:01:19.952 --> 00:01:23.622
you want to do and then adjusting the user interface

31
00:01:23.622 --> 00:01:26.527
controls on a per service basis.

32
00:01:26.527 --> 00:01:28.791
We can change the pointer size, for instance.

33
00:01:28.791 --> 00:01:33.094
Notice that I've already selected the largest size and I've actually changed

34
00:01:33.094 --> 00:01:37.590
the pointer color from white to black to make it easier for me to see and I

35
00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.925
hope it's a little bit easier for you to see as well.

36
00:01:39.925 --> 00:01:44.099
We've got color and high contrast options for people with low vision.

37
00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:45.502
And there you have it.

38
00:01:45.502 --> 00:01:49.544
Now let's come back home and I actually used the power example a moment ago,

39
00:01:49.544 --> 00:01:50.049
didn't I,

40
00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:52.982
where if you want to search for a specific option and you

41
00:01:52.982 --> 00:01:54.758
don't want to work through the categories,

42
00:01:54.758 --> 00:01:59.053
you can go directly do not pass go, do not collect $100,

43
00:01:59.053 --> 00:02:01.042
go to the power and sleep settings.

44
00:02:01.042 --> 00:02:03.934
There's really just a couple here in the settings interface.

45
00:02:03.934 --> 00:02:06.669
If you want to go to additional power settings,

46
00:02:06.669 --> 00:02:09.175
it opens up the classic Control Panel.

47
00:02:09.175 --> 00:02:11.511
Actually, that reminds me of a learning point.

48
00:02:11.511 --> 00:02:14.163
If you read the Microsoft literature,

49
00:02:14.163 --> 00:02:19.002
what Microsoft says themselves is that you should find the majority of your

50
00:02:19.002 --> 00:02:23.341
most frequently used configuration options in the Windows 10 settings app

51
00:02:23.341 --> 00:02:26.984
and then for more advanced special case options,

52
00:02:26.984 --> 00:02:30.458
you'll go to the classic Control Panel.

53
00:02:30.458 --> 00:02:34.559
Now you can learn more about power plans by searching for

54
00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:36.934
Windows Power Plans in the Pluralsight library,

55
00:02:36.934 --> 00:02:37.601
but basically,

56
00:02:37.601 --> 00:02:41.987
a power plan is a collection of settings that relate to things

57
00:02:41.987 --> 00:02:44.855
like how long before you turn off the display,

58
00:02:44.855 --> 00:02:47.228
how long before you put the computer to sleep,

59
00:02:47.228 --> 00:02:49.481
do you want to put the hard disk to sleep,

60
00:02:49.481 --> 00:02:52.864
do you want the network to wake up the computer if you try

61
00:02:52.864 --> 00:02:55.981
to connect to the computer remotely, this kind of stuff.

62
00:02:55.981 --> 00:02:59.244
As far as display settings, again, this is almost muscle,

63
00:02:59.244 --> 00:03:01.378
it is muscle memory at this point.

64
00:03:01.378 --> 00:03:04.478
I will almost always just right-click an unoccupied portion

65
00:03:04.478 --> 00:03:08.225
of the Windows desktop and we can choose personalize if you

66
00:03:08.225 --> 00:03:10.544
want to change the look and feel,

67
00:03:10.544 --> 00:03:13.482
display settings if you want to adjust the resolution,

68
00:03:13.482 --> 00:03:15.529
color depth, this sort of thing.

69
00:03:15.529 --> 00:03:16.686
Before I go there though,

70
00:03:16.686 --> 00:03:19.335
I just want to quickly mention this that you might have

71
00:03:19.335 --> 00:03:21.877
noticed that your shortcut menu when you right-click the

72
00:03:21.877 --> 00:03:23.581
desktop looks a bit different from mine.

73
00:03:23.581 --> 00:03:27.016
What you have here are what are called shell extensions.

74
00:03:27.016 --> 00:03:30.979
Some applications allow you to add for convenience

75
00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:34.024
certain options into the shortcut menu.

76
00:03:34.024 --> 00:03:35.947
So I've installed Visual Studio code,

77
00:03:35.947 --> 00:03:38.929
this is a free text editor that Microsoft publishes.

78
00:03:38.929 --> 00:03:41.397
I could right-click a file, for instance,

79
00:03:41.397 --> 00:03:46.747
and choose Open with code to easily open the file using Visual Studio code.

80
00:03:46.747 --> 00:03:49.079
I also have installed the Get tools.

81
00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:53.174
Get is a version control system that's used by programmers and

82
00:03:53.174 --> 00:03:57.498
administrative automation people and you can open up or initialize a

83
00:03:57.498 --> 00:04:00.840
get graphical or a bash session from this location,

84
00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.929
again, through the right mouse click.

85
00:04:02.929 --> 00:04:05.557
If we go to Display settings, whoop, I guess I was wrong.

86
00:04:05.557 --> 00:04:09.265
I thought the display settings would open up the old classic interface,

87
00:04:09.265 --> 00:04:12.904
but basically, this is where you can control the resolution.

88
00:04:12.904 --> 00:04:14.491
If you have multiple displays,

89
00:04:14.491 --> 00:04:18.432
you can adjust the order in which you want your displays listed.

90
00:04:18.432 --> 00:04:21.236
I, myself, have three displays on my computer.

91
00:04:21.236 --> 00:04:22.808
They don't show on this virtual machine,

92
00:04:22.808 --> 00:04:26.106
of course, but they would on my honest to goodness computer,

93
00:04:26.106 --> 00:04:27.276
my hardware computer.

94
00:04:27.276 --> 00:04:31.990
Now the options that you see here in terms of scaling and resolution and

95
00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:36.370
color depth are wholly dependent upon your display adapter and notice that

96
00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.809
there is a link to display adapter properties,

97
00:04:38.809 --> 00:04:42.331
and sure enough, that takes us into the classic Control Panel.

98
00:04:42.331 --> 00:04:45.507
Display adapter refers to the device driver.

99
00:04:45.507 --> 00:04:49.230
This is the engine that allows Windows to more accurately

100
00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:56.000
control a particular piece of hardware. We'll talk more about that as the course goes on.
