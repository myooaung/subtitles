1
00:00:01,223 --> 00:00:03,567
Local printing.

2
00:00:03,567 --> 00:00:05,473
Now Microsoft has always been a bit persnickety,

3
00:00:05,473 --> 00:00:10,413
if you don't mind the five-dollar word, about their terminology with printing.

4
00:00:10,413 --> 00:00:11,773
In the Microsoft context,

5
00:00:11,773 --> 00:00:15,551
a print device refers to the physical device that produces output.

6
00:00:15,551 --> 00:00:20,176
This could be a laser printer, maybe in older shops a dot matrix printer,

7
00:00:20,176 --> 00:00:23,479
or commonly in the home you might find an inkjet printer,

8
00:00:23,479 --> 00:00:24,851
it's the actual device.

9
00:00:24,851 --> 00:00:28,350
The printer port can be a physical or virtual interface.

10
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:33,061
We'll cover what both of those mean upcoming later in this module.

11
00:00:33,061 --> 00:00:36,790
The printer in Microsoft nomenclature is the software

12
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:39,361
representation of a print device.

13
00:00:39,361 --> 00:00:40,271
This should make sense.

14
00:00:40,271 --> 00:00:42,898
When you go to print a document by doing a File,

15
00:00:42,898 --> 00:00:45,016
Print, you select the software printer,

16
00:00:45,016 --> 00:00:49,888
and then you go to the physical print device to retrieve the output.

17
00:00:49,888 --> 00:00:53,062
A printer driver is a piece of software that serves

18
00:00:53,062 --> 00:00:56,147
as an interface between Windows, the operating system,

19
00:00:56,147 --> 00:00:58,281
and the physical print device.

20
00:00:58,281 --> 00:01:01,547
You know that we need drivers for any hardware in Windows,

21
00:01:01,547 --> 00:01:03,118
printer driver it's no different.

22
00:01:03,118 --> 00:01:03,746
In fact,

23
00:01:03,746 --> 00:01:10,502
we have bit more to say about printer drivers and their behavior in Windows 10.

24
00:01:10,502 --> 00:01:11,352
But first though,

25
00:01:11,352 --> 00:01:14,286
let's take a trip through memory lane and examine the

26
00:01:14,286 --> 00:01:15,818
various common printer interfaces.

27
00:01:15,818 --> 00:01:18,116
When I use the term interface,

28
00:01:18,116 --> 00:01:22,144
I'm referring to a hardware interconnect between the print device on one

29
00:01:22,144 --> 00:01:26,149
side and a matching port on your computer on the other.

30
00:01:26,149 --> 00:01:28,051
If you've ever heard of the old parallel port,

31
00:01:28,051 --> 00:01:29,693
that's what you see in this picture,

32
00:01:29,693 --> 00:01:33,208
when I got into the IT industry full time in the '90s,

33
00:01:33,208 --> 00:01:35,451
that was a pretty standard interface.

34
00:01:35,451 --> 00:01:39,362
They're very slow, they're not compatible with Plug and Play.

35
00:01:39,362 --> 00:01:41,127
If you make a configuration change,

36
00:01:41,127 --> 00:01:43,608
you'll likely have to power cycle the printer,

37
00:01:43,608 --> 00:01:47,188
but you'll be surprised to see how many legacy shops,

38
00:01:47,188 --> 00:01:49,993
and when I say legacy I'm referring to a business

39
00:01:49,993 --> 00:01:51,782
that's still using hardware that's many,

40
00:01:51,782 --> 00:01:55,442
many years old, you may run across a parallel port printer nowadays,

41
00:01:55,442 --> 00:01:56,531
but to be honest,

42
00:01:56,531 --> 00:02:00,022
if you want to connect a parallel port printer to

43
00:02:00,022 --> 00:02:01,880
any current generation computer,

44
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,445
you're going to have to purchase a matching interface card

45
00:02:05,445 --> 00:02:07,877
and install it in the chassis first.

46
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:12,854
The Small Computer Systems Interface, or SCSI standard, has come a long way.

47
00:02:12,854 --> 00:02:16,481
It's generally considered faster, by all accounts than parallel,

48
00:02:16,481 --> 00:02:20,863
but parallel SCSI even has gone the way of the dodo in favor of

49
00:02:20,863 --> 00:02:22,783
faster and more reliable printer interfaces,

50
00:02:22,783 --> 00:02:25,779
like the Universal Serial Bus.

51
00:02:25,779 --> 00:02:29,785
Each successive version of USB, we're up to version 3 now,

52
00:02:29,785 --> 00:02:31,166
gets faster and more reliable,

53
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:34,313
and there are a number of form factors for those plugs.

54
00:02:34,313 --> 00:02:38,667
Now you don't have to worry about the interface plug types for this exam,

55
00:02:38,667 --> 00:02:39,897
but if you're interested,

56
00:02:39,897 --> 00:02:43,268
I would encourage you to check the Pluralsight library for

57
00:02:43,268 --> 00:02:47,649
my CompTIA A+ training because I go into great detail on how

58
00:02:47,649 --> 00:02:49,141
these various interfaces work.

59
00:02:49,141 --> 00:02:51,799
As far as wireless printing goes, you have infrared,

60
00:02:51,799 --> 00:02:57,631
which is a line-of-sight printing you see in this small picture on an old flip

61
00:02:57,631 --> 00:03:02,222
phone using infrared to print from the phone to the printer.

62
00:03:02,222 --> 00:03:06,082
The line-of-sight really weakens IR's practicality though.

63
00:03:06,082 --> 00:03:09,025
Bluetooth is a longer-range wireless technology,

64
00:03:09,025 --> 00:03:12,816
30-40 feet that does not require line of sight.

65
00:03:12,816 --> 00:03:16,474
Wi-Fi and Ethernet are by far the most common approaches.

66
00:03:16,474 --> 00:03:19,356
Well, for a true local printer it would be USB,

67
00:03:19,356 --> 00:03:22,797
and as far as wireless access goes,

68
00:03:22,797 --> 00:03:29,000
it would be traditional Wi-Fi or in a wired network context, Ethernet.
