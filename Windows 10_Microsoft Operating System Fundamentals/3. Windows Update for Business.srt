1
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:05,569
Now Windows Update for Business is not what you might think.

2
00:00:05,569 --> 00:00:08,605
In the previous module when we looked at OneDrive,

3
00:00:08,605 --> 00:00:12,440
I know for a fact that some of my students have said,

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:15,397
I always thought that OneDrive and OneDrive for Business

5
00:00:15,397 --> 00:00:17,257
were two totally separate products.

6
00:00:17,257 --> 00:00:22,086
And they are in many ways, but they're both accomplishing the same goal,

7
00:00:22,086 --> 00:00:24,372
it's just that the focus is different.

8
00:00:24,372 --> 00:00:28,547
Similarly in Windows Update, you have the Windows Update Control Panel,

9
00:00:28,547 --> 00:00:29,695
or setting technically,

10
00:00:29,695 --> 00:00:33,688
in Windows 10 that the consumer manages himself or herself,

11
00:00:33,688 --> 00:00:37,176
and Windows Update for Business is aimed towards

12
00:00:37,176 --> 00:00:39,759
centralized management of Windows Update.

13
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:43,062
Now we're going to talk about Windows Server Update services in a moment,

14
00:00:43,062 --> 00:00:44,849
that's been around for a long time,

15
00:00:44,849 --> 00:00:48,031
but what you're looking at at this slide is essentially

16
00:00:48,031 --> 00:00:50,319
a couple new Group Policy settings.

17
00:00:50,319 --> 00:00:52,784
In the local or domain Group Policy editor,

18
00:00:52,784 --> 00:00:56,422
the path is Computer Configuration, Administrative Templates,

19
00:00:56,422 --> 00:01:00,337
Windows Components, Windows Update, Windows Update for Business.

20
00:01:00,337 --> 00:01:01,432
And essentially,

21
00:01:01,432 --> 00:01:07,280
these policies allow an administrator to defer certain type of updates,

22
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,804
and also potentially opt into preview builds.

23
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:14,972
Now you certainly wouldn't want to roll pre-release Windows Client versions to

24
00:01:14,972 --> 00:01:18,732
your users who need their systems to do their work each day,

25
00:01:18,732 --> 00:01:23,937
but most configuration managers I know do belong to the Windows Insider program,

26
00:01:23,937 --> 00:01:29,823
and do have preview builds on at least a couple test or demo test dev

27
00:01:29,823 --> 00:01:34,823
workstations in order to test new functionality and see how that new version

28
00:01:34,823 --> 00:01:37,444
interoperates with your line of business software.

29
00:01:37,444 --> 00:01:40,427
You might be underwhelmed with this Windows Update for Business.

30
00:01:40,427 --> 00:01:42,947
You mean it's just a few Group Policy settings?

31
00:01:42,947 --> 00:01:47,638
How would we, for instance, schedule Windows Update across our enterprise?

32
00:01:47,638 --> 00:01:51,479
How could we approve or block certain Windows updates that

33
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:56,327
we know we want to green light or block for performance

34
00:01:56,327 --> 00:01:58,175
reasons or stability reasons?

35
00:01:58,175 --> 00:02:05,431
Well that brings us to the subject of WSUS, or as some people call it, WSUS.

36
00:02:05,431 --> 00:02:08,818
Windows Server Update Services has been around for many,

37
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:10,231
many Windows Server versions.

38
00:02:10,231 --> 00:02:14,192
Understand that this is what you install in Windows Server.

39
00:02:14,192 --> 00:02:16,494
It's a built-in server role.

40
00:02:16,494 --> 00:02:18,500
If you want to go into the Pluralsight library,

41
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,376
we have plenty of training on it,

42
00:02:20,376 --> 00:02:24,969
but what I will say is that WSUS allows an organization to take

43
00:02:24,969 --> 00:02:28,021
full control over the Windows Update lifecycle.

44
00:02:28,021 --> 00:02:31,394
As you can see, its interface here is a little bit cluttered,

45
00:02:31,394 --> 00:02:35,912
but basically you have managed computers in your Active Directory environment,

46
00:02:35,912 --> 00:02:39,220
those computers may be running different versions of Windows,

47
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:41,331
you may, in an international organization,

48
00:02:41,331 --> 00:02:45,508
may have users running non, whatever your native language is,

49
00:02:45,508 --> 00:02:47,292
other languages besides that.

50
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:52,290
And you can corral updates across many different Microsoft products,

51
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:54,924
many different product versions, and even languages,

52
00:02:54,924 --> 00:03:00,148
and run your tests and approve or block updates as you see fit.

53
00:03:00,148 --> 00:03:02,526
There's also performance advantages of this.

54
00:03:02,526 --> 00:03:06,175
Instead of 500 client devices going out over the internet and

55
00:03:06,175 --> 00:03:09,309
downloading a whole bunch of files from Microsoft's website,

56
00:03:09,309 --> 00:03:12,294
you can download them just once into your local LAN,

57
00:03:12,294 --> 00:03:14,390
stage them on your WSUS server,

58
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:19,141
and your client computers will pull from WSUS as opposed to Microsoft Update.

59
00:03:19,141 --> 00:03:20,868
Now how do they do that?

60
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:25,826
That's a little bit more of Group Policy magic, pointing your users to WSUS.

61
00:03:25,826 --> 00:03:32,000
That gets beyond our scope though. I've covered what you need to know in our context right now.
