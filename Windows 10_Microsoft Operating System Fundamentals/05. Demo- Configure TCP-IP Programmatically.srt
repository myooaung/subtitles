1
00:00:00,629 --> 00:00:06,140
Let me right-click my PowerShell icon and choose Run as Administrator.

2
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:08,668
I want to open an elevated PowerShell prompt.

3
00:00:08,668 --> 00:00:12,601
Now although this is PowerShell, and not the CMD environment,

4
00:00:12,601 --> 00:00:16,830
we still can use certain old-school executables with no problem.

5
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:21,068
So, for instance, we can use ipconfig with no other options,

6
00:00:21,068 --> 00:00:24,112
and it gives you brief results for each of your interfaces.

7
00:00:24,112 --> 00:00:27,207
I want to pay particular attention to my internal one,

8
00:00:27,207 --> 00:00:32,560
which is my business network, and we see that we have the IPv4 static assignment,

9
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,535
and a subnet address, and its default gateway,

10
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:38,791
but we're not able to see additional addresses that might be relevant,

11
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:42,644
specifically, is this machine a member of an Active Directory domain?

12
00:00:42,644 --> 00:00:45,279
Can we communicate with the Domain Name System,

13
00:00:45,279 --> 00:00:47,495
or DNS server, you see what I mean?

14
00:00:47,495 --> 00:00:49,460
So let me clear the screen with cls,

15
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:53,415
up arrow twice to bring back the ipconfig command,

16
00:00:53,415 --> 00:00:56,052
and I'm going to do /all.

17
00:00:56,052 --> 00:00:58,264
And this gives a lot more information.

18
00:00:58,264 --> 00:01:01,911
So let's go back to Internal, and see if there's anything more here.

19
00:01:01,911 --> 00:01:04,219
While we have our DNS server, that's true,

20
00:01:04,219 --> 00:01:09,461
if we were using DHCP, we would have a separate entry for DHCP.

21
00:01:09,461 --> 00:01:12,466
Here it has some DHCPv6.

22
00:01:12,466 --> 00:01:16,674
That's because IPv6 will auto-generate unique addresses.

23
00:01:16,674 --> 00:01:22,092
It functions much differently with DHCP than how IPv4 does.

24
00:01:22,092 --> 00:01:25,210
As a matter of fact, let me scroll down to my public interface,

25
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,880
and that has what I'm talking about here.

26
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:32,333
We have multiple DNS servers two of them using IPv6,

27
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:38,243
that's what the 2001:558 business is, and we have an IPv4 DHCP Server,

28
00:01:38,243 --> 00:01:42,180
and it looks like we also have a Default Gateway

29
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:45,181
that's using both IPv6 and IPv4.

30
00:01:45,181 --> 00:01:48,406
It's actually good to see so much IPv6 here,

31
00:01:48,406 --> 00:01:51,843
because it truly is the way that the internet,

32
00:01:51,843 --> 00:01:55,545
and even local area connectivity is going to go.

33
00:01:55,545 --> 00:01:58,553
It's going to be many years since we have IPv6 only.

34
00:01:58,553 --> 00:02:01,402
We're going to be running in what's called a dual stack

35
00:02:01,402 --> 00:02:02,985
configuration for the foreseeable future,

36
00:02:02,985 --> 00:02:06,407
but I'm pretty proud of my internet service provider,

37
00:02:06,407 --> 00:02:10,849
Comcast, because they've definitely embraced IPv6 quite robustly indeed.

38
00:02:10,849 --> 00:02:16,189
Now, let me cls again to clear the screen, and try some commands, like hostname.

39
00:02:16,189 --> 00:02:20,098
If this were a member of a domain, I could see that.

40
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:23,961
Actually another command that's useful for testing domain membership is whoami.

41
00:02:23,961 --> 00:02:26,397
Now you notice the syntax here,

42
00:02:26,397 --> 00:02:31,324
it's going to be computer or domain name backslash the username.

43
00:02:31,324 --> 00:02:34,704
Hostname tells me that this machine is called devbox.

44
00:02:34,704 --> 00:02:38,045
Devox\tim means that I'm logged on as a local user,

45
00:02:38,045 --> 00:02:40,644
and I'm not a member of a domain.

46
00:02:40,644 --> 00:02:45,033
Of course, I can always verify that by looking at the System Control Panel.

47
00:02:45,033 --> 00:02:48,132
Let me type control to open the classic Control Panel.

48
00:02:48,132 --> 00:02:52,116
You notice that I'm studiously avoiding that Settings app.

49
00:02:52,116 --> 00:02:57,152
Let me go to System, here we go, and we can see right here under Computer name,

50
00:02:57,152 --> 00:03:00,124
domain, and Workgroup settings, that we're in a workgroup,

51
00:03:00,124 --> 00:03:01,480
we're in a non-domain environment.

52
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:05,974
If we want to change that, we can use User Account control to do so.

53
00:03:05,974 --> 00:03:10,352
We can go to Change here, not only to edit the computer name,

54
00:03:10,352 --> 00:03:15,197
but also, as I said, to join a domain, and my domain is called company.

55
00:03:15,197 --> 00:03:15,520
pri.

56
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,628
And assuming that you have DNS connectivity to the

57
00:03:18,628 --> 00:03:20,224
domain and everything goes right,

58
00:03:20,224 --> 00:03:24,360
we're prompted for an account that has the permission to join the domain.

59
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,304
And in some environments, very few I've worked with,

60
00:03:27,304 --> 00:03:30,733
users have that ability to rejoin their computer to the domain,

61
00:03:30,733 --> 00:03:35,781
but that requires more tech skills than I would consider many end users to have.

62
00:03:35,781 --> 00:03:38,395
Let me authenticate with domain admin credentials.

63
00:03:38,395 --> 00:03:40,681
The network path was not found.

64
00:03:40,681 --> 00:03:41,994
That's a weird error.

65
00:03:41,994 --> 00:03:44,291
Well, let's do some live troubleshooting together.

66
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:47,515
Let's come back here and let me do a ping -4.

67
00:03:47,515 --> 00:03:50,678
That ensures that we're going to use IPv4.

68
00:03:50,678 --> 00:03:53,712
The name of my domain controller is dc1.

69
00:03:53,712 --> 00:03:57,352
Now ipconfig has a lot of other things involved,

70
00:03:57,352 --> 00:03:58,260
that is,

71
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:02,369
you can do things like releasing and renewing your

72
00:04:02,369 --> 00:04:05,149
IP address if you're using DHCP.

73
00:04:05,149 --> 00:04:07,539
You can also flush your DNS Cache.

74
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:10,450
DNS, if you don't know, I would assume you know,

75
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:11,414
but if you don't,

76
00:04:11,414 --> 00:04:15,162
Domain Name System is simply a directory of hostnames and IP addresses

77
00:04:15,162 --> 00:04:19,388
so that you can communicate with other machines using hostnames rather

78
00:04:19,388 --> 00:04:22,352
than having to know and type IP addresses.

79
00:04:22,352 --> 00:04:25,946
But look here, you can re-register yourself with DNS.

80
00:04:25,946 --> 00:04:27,938
Let me do that.

81
00:04:27,938 --> 00:04:31,331
Ipconfig registerdns, it'll take a moment to do this,

82
00:04:31,331 --> 00:04:33,980
my DNS server is my dc1 domain controller,

83
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:37,005
by the way, and so now let me do a ping -4,

84
00:04:37,005 --> 00:04:42,227
but this time let me try the fully-qualified name of that server,

85
00:04:42,227 --> 00:04:42,724
dc1.

86
00:04:42,724 --> 00:04:43,220
company.

87
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:43,716
pri.

88
00:04:43,716 --> 00:04:46,236
Well, I have connectivity thanks to ping.

89
00:04:46,236 --> 00:04:47,676
Ping, in Windows anyway,

90
00:04:47,676 --> 00:04:52,462
sends out four internet control message protocol ICMP echoes,

91
00:04:52,462 --> 00:04:54,792
echo requests, and the idea is that number one,

92
00:04:54,792 --> 00:04:57,807
you want to get four replies back, that's the first thing,

93
00:04:57,807 --> 00:05:01,441
and the second thing is you want to look at the time.

94
00:05:01,441 --> 00:05:04,750
I have a super-duper fast connection to dc1 because the

95
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:07,408
response time is less than 1 millisecond,

96
00:05:07,408 --> 00:05:09,981
so it's certainly not a question of latency.

97
00:05:09,981 --> 00:05:11,609
Let's try this again.

98
00:05:11,609 --> 00:05:12,423
I'll authenticate.

99
00:05:12,423 --> 00:05:15,786
This time I'm going to do company, I'm going to choose a different account.

100
00:05:15,786 --> 00:05:17,962
I guess the second or third time is the charm,

101
00:05:17,962 --> 00:05:20,804
this is what we want to see, Welcome to the company.

102
00:05:20,804 --> 00:05:21,463
pri domain,

103
00:05:21,463 --> 00:05:25,952
and we're going to have to restart in order to put this into practice.

104
00:05:25,952 --> 00:05:29,085
Alternatively, let me bring up PowerShell one more time,

105
00:05:29,085 --> 00:05:30,658
we could use Add-Computer.

106
00:05:30,658 --> 00:05:33,636
Let me run get-help against Add-Computer,

107
00:05:33,636 --> 00:05:36,051
not Get-Computer, and look at examples.

108
00:05:36,051 --> 00:05:38,540
Programmatically, this is the way to go.

109
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:42,466
And the tersest, if that's a word, command would be this one,

110
00:05:42,466 --> 00:05:45,401
Add-Computer to the specified DomainName,

111
00:05:45,401 --> 00:05:45,988
Restart.

112
00:05:45,988 --> 00:05:48,527
When you run that, you'll get the authentication prompt,

113
00:05:48,527 --> 00:05:51,265
and then the Restart flag will automatically restart

114
00:05:51,265 --> 00:05:55,205
after you've joined to the domain, but I'm going to choose Restart now,

115
00:05:55,205 --> 00:05:58,836
and then I'll show you the logon and we'll call this demo finished.

116
00:05:58,836 --> 00:06:03,348
Here we are at our logon screen, and I want to come down to Other user,

117
00:06:03,348 --> 00:06:05,376
because I'm not using my local account anymore.

118
00:06:05,376 --> 00:06:07,590
That can be a point of confusion among many now.

119
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:12,858
This Tim Warner account you see here is a local machine on this devbox machine.

120
00:06:12,858 --> 00:06:17,436
No, we want to go to Other user, and it defaults to Sign in to: COMPANY.

121
00:06:17,436 --> 00:06:19,609
Now you can override that, for instance.

122
00:06:19,609 --> 00:06:23,221
Let's say, for instance, I still wanted to log onto the local computer,

123
00:06:23,221 --> 00:06:26,083
I would have to know the computer's name,

124
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:28,657
and it's devbox, it's devbox1.

125
00:06:28,657 --> 00:06:30,765
And if I do devbox1\,

126
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:34,872
notice that it now says sign onto DEVBOX1 and I

127
00:06:34,872 --> 00:06:36,708
could specify a local credential.

128
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:40,509
Otherwise, if I'm domain-joined it's going to go to the domain by default,

129
00:06:40,509 --> 00:06:48,000
so I'm going to authenticate with my trainer account, and here we go, I've got myself a desktop.
