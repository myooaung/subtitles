1
00:00:01,799 --> 00:00:04,662
Microsoft Edge.

2
00:00:04,662 --> 00:00:08,328
Microsoft Edge is the default web browser in Windows 10.

3
00:00:08,328 --> 00:00:10,173
In the Microsoft documentation, oftentimes,

4
00:00:10,173 --> 00:00:15,390
they just refer to it as Edge, it's a marketing term more than anything else.

5
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:19,874
We contrast edge with what was previously the default browser for many,

6
00:00:19,874 --> 00:00:21,741
many years, Internet Explorer.

7
00:00:21,741 --> 00:00:25,800
This screenshot is from Internet Explorer v3 that shipped with

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,899
Windows 95 and if it looks kind of archaic,

9
00:00:28,899 --> 00:00:32,615
that's because the web was pretty archaic back in those days.

10
00:00:32,615 --> 00:00:35,514
I, myself, have used Internet Explorer since version 2,

11
00:00:35,514 --> 00:00:39,962
so I've seen the product grow as the world wide web and internet

12
00:00:39,962 --> 00:00:44,581
connectivity have grown over the past couple dozen years or so.

13
00:00:44,581 --> 00:00:49,553
I think it's instructive to compare and contrast IE with Edge because

14
00:00:49,553 --> 00:00:53,364
you're going to find that in Windows 10 IE still exists,

15
00:00:53,364 --> 00:00:57,186
even though, officially, it's a deprecated web browser.

16
00:00:57,186 --> 00:01:02,119
Internet Explorer 11 is the version that ships with Windows 10.

17
00:01:02,119 --> 00:01:05,494
I don't believe we're ever going to see a 12 because as I said,

18
00:01:05,494 --> 00:01:08,036
Microsoft has officially deprecated it.

19
00:01:08,036 --> 00:01:08,545
Basically,

20
00:01:08,545 --> 00:01:13,579
Internet Explorer 11 is included in Windows 10 for backward compatibility only.

21
00:01:13,579 --> 00:01:17,320
As I said before, the browser has been around since the mid-90s,

22
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:20,250
whereas, Microsoft Edge is a brand-new project,

23
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:23,860
officially it was forked from Internet Explorer 11 and

24
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:27,444
basically what forked means is that you take the source

25
00:01:27,444 --> 00:01:31,703
code from Internet Explorer 11, create a copy of that code base,

26
00:01:31,703 --> 00:01:35,034
and then they rearchitected the browser from Scratch.

27
00:01:35,034 --> 00:01:39,240
So Edge is not Internet Explorer 11+ so to speak,

28
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:44,679
it's a new browser that has minimal to do with or very little to do,

29
00:01:44,679 --> 00:01:47,949
to use more correct English, with Internet Explorer 11,

30
00:01:47,949 --> 00:01:50,878
other than it was originally forked from the project.

31
00:01:50,878 --> 00:01:54,653
A web browser what has what's called a rendering or layout engine,

32
00:01:54,653 --> 00:01:58,616
actually there is several engines that exist within a web browser,

33
00:01:58,616 --> 00:02:01,408
but the one that handles most of your page rendering

34
00:02:01,408 --> 00:02:03,271
and layout is called just that,

35
00:02:03,271 --> 00:02:07,445
the rendering and layout engine and Trident is the code name for the layout

36
00:02:07,445 --> 00:02:10,361
engine that's historically been in Internet Explorer.

37
00:02:10,361 --> 00:02:14,271
EdgeHTML is a brand-new rendering and layout engine in Edge.

38
00:02:14,271 --> 00:02:20,000
The idea here is that with 21st century internet and web standards becoming

39
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,593
truly standardized across different vendors and platforms,

40
00:02:23,593 --> 00:02:28,121
EdgeHTML plays much better in the current web than Trident has.

41
00:02:28,121 --> 00:02:30,749
For instance, this is a good example here.

42
00:02:30,749 --> 00:02:31,081
Historically,

43
00:02:31,081 --> 00:02:35,115
as the internet and the world wide web developed and we got

44
00:02:35,115 --> 00:02:37,807
later and later versions of Internet Explorer,

45
00:02:37,807 --> 00:02:41,919
Microsoft still took a rather proprietary tact in the way that you would

46
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:46,314
add or should I say developers would add functionality to Internet Explorer

47
00:02:46,314 --> 00:02:51,720
and how web designers could add interactivity on their sites is to create

48
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:56,939
code objects using the ActiveX technology and these code objects are called

49
00:02:56,939 --> 00:02:58,915
Browser Helper Objects, or BHOs.

50
00:02:58,915 --> 00:03:03,215
These represent a big security problem because it is executable code that

51
00:03:03,215 --> 00:03:06,233
gets downloaded to the user's computer and run locally.

52
00:03:06,233 --> 00:03:08,397
And if you know much about information security,

53
00:03:08,397 --> 00:03:11,689
you really want to control every bit of executable code

54
00:03:11,689 --> 00:03:16,218
that executes on a user's system, so those are really not desirable.

55
00:03:16,218 --> 00:03:20,292
Microsoft Edge actually does not support ActiveX Browser Helper Objects.

56
00:03:20,292 --> 00:03:20,720
Instead,

57
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:25,071
Edge uses the same model that you see in other leading web

58
00:03:25,071 --> 00:03:28,109
browsers like Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox,

59
00:03:28,109 --> 00:03:29,254
namely extensions.

60
00:03:29,254 --> 00:03:34,922
These are basically JavaScript modules that run locally on the user's computer,

61
00:03:34,922 --> 00:03:38,937
but in a much more sandboxed and secure environment and provide a

62
00:03:38,937 --> 00:03:42,615
lot of the same kind of additional functionality that you used to

63
00:03:42,615 --> 00:03:45,326
try to get with BHOs years ago.

64
00:03:45,326 --> 00:03:46,529
As I said,

65
00:03:46,529 --> 00:03:49,325
Internet Explorer started and spent most of its

66
00:03:49,325 --> 00:03:52,386
life as a proprietary technology, so as a web developer,

67
00:03:52,386 --> 00:03:55,820
you typically had to develop your websites for compatibility

68
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:59,541
with IE and pretty much all the other browsers.

69
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:02,022
Browsers like Chrome and Firefox have historically

70
00:04:02,022 --> 00:04:05,028
cleaved much more closely to web standards,

71
00:04:05,028 --> 00:04:08,735
whereas IE always historically has had its own

72
00:04:08,735 --> 00:04:10,268
little proprietary hooks thrown in.

73
00:04:10,268 --> 00:04:13,104
The great news is that in more recent years,

74
00:04:13,104 --> 00:04:15,533
specifically since Satya Nadella took over Microsoft,

75
00:04:15,533 --> 00:04:19,000
Microsoft is much more willing to embrace standards

76
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,295
and Edge is a good example of this.

77
00:04:21,295 --> 00:04:25,095
The idea with Edge is that it should play perfectly well with

78
00:04:25,095 --> 00:04:28,444
HTML5 and all the current accepted web standards.

79
00:04:28,444 --> 00:04:32,132
Another thing, Internet Explorer 11 has a slow update cycle.

80
00:04:32,132 --> 00:04:34,629
As a matter of fact, the update cycle is gone now.

81
00:04:34,629 --> 00:04:36,453
Internet Explorer 11 is deprecated,

82
00:04:36,453 --> 00:04:39,731
which means that Microsoft is no longer investing

83
00:04:39,731 --> 00:04:42,155
resources in adding new features.

84
00:04:42,155 --> 00:04:46,972
It will, Microsoft will release security updates for IE 11, but that's it.

85
00:04:46,972 --> 00:04:52,066
Now by contrast, as I said, Microsoft Edge was designed initially for two things,

86
00:04:52,066 --> 00:04:55,095
for compatibility with web standards and speed.

87
00:04:55,095 --> 00:04:57,021
Finally, on Internet Explorer 11,

88
00:04:57,021 --> 00:05:00,891
you normally would have a different experience on different devices

89
00:05:00,891 --> 00:05:03,617
if you're running Internet Explorer on Windows.

90
00:05:03,617 --> 00:05:05,835
For a while, there was IE on Mac,

91
00:05:05,835 --> 00:05:08,246
then there was the various mobile operating systems,

92
00:05:08,246 --> 00:05:11,983
Windows CE if you remember that from many years ago.

93
00:05:11,983 --> 00:05:15,466
Microsoft tried to give a generally similar feel,

94
00:05:15,466 --> 00:05:19,236
but they were different products from the ground up.

95
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:20,058
By contrast,

96
00:05:20,058 --> 00:05:23,775
Microsoft Edge to go back to the update cycle has a

97
00:05:23,775 --> 00:05:25,328
much more agile update cycle.

98
00:05:25,328 --> 00:05:28,229
This reflects current security trends where you have

99
00:05:28,229 --> 00:05:30,708
exploits being taken advantage of immediately,

100
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:32,023
in most cases,

101
00:05:32,023 --> 00:05:35,527
where Microsoft needs to respond and patch their

102
00:05:35,527 --> 00:05:38,591
software as quickly as they possible can.

103
00:05:38,591 --> 00:05:42,060
And then as far as the different experience goes,

104
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:45,083
besides speed and besides compatibility with web standards,

105
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:51,025
I'll throw in a third design goal of the Edge browser and that is to have a

106
00:05:51,025 --> 00:05:53,417
consistent behavior and experience across different devices,

107
00:05:53,417 --> 00:05:55,144
and believe it or not,

108
00:05:55,144 --> 00:06:03,000
Microsoft is even developing Edge for Apple iOS devices and Google Android devices.
