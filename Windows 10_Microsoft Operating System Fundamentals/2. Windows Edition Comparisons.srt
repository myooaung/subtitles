1
00:00:02,115 --> 00:00:02,704
Now then,

2
00:00:02,704 --> 00:00:05,874
let's run through a quick comparison of the major differentiating

3
00:00:05,874 --> 00:00:09,511
features between the different Windows 10 editions.

4
00:00:09,511 --> 00:00:10,263
First of all,

5
00:00:10,263 --> 00:00:13,305
it's important to understand that we have the home SKU that's

6
00:00:13,305 --> 00:00:17,045
intended for non-business environments where you have

7
00:00:17,045 --> 00:00:22,377
presumably less networking going on, and you still have an emphasis on security,

8
00:00:22,377 --> 00:00:26,650
but not mass enterprise level security across dozens,

9
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:30,709
hundreds, thousands, or tens of thousands of machines.

10
00:00:30,709 --> 00:00:34,266
Both home and pro give you the Cortana digital voice assistant.

11
00:00:34,266 --> 00:00:36,822
You can to Tablet mode, also called Continuum.

12
00:00:36,822 --> 00:00:39,671
We have the Edge browser, Mobile Device Management,

13
00:00:39,671 --> 00:00:45,950
which means that you can enroll Windows 10 home or pro in Microsoft Intune.

14
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:49,068
I know it's not exactly a misnomer, but a bit confusing.

15
00:00:49,068 --> 00:00:53,589
I normally think of MDM as pertaining to tablets and phones,

16
00:00:53,589 --> 00:00:57,347
but of course, Windows 10 can indeed run on a tablet computer,

17
00:00:57,347 --> 00:00:59,277
and you can, in fact,

18
00:00:59,277 --> 00:01:03,963
enroll desktop and laptop computers running 10 in Microsoft Intune as well.

19
00:01:03,963 --> 00:01:06,343
That's all under the MDM umbrella.

20
00:01:06,343 --> 00:01:11,939
Trusted Boot is a secure way to start a computer and prevent

21
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:15,336
malware from injecting itself into the boot process.

22
00:01:15,336 --> 00:01:21,091
Windows Hello is a Multifactor Authentication scheme where you can log on using

23
00:01:21,091 --> 00:01:25,289
biometrics in addition or instead of just a simple password.

24
00:01:25,289 --> 00:01:27,021
Now the pro only SKU, again,

25
00:01:27,021 --> 00:01:30,947
we're thinking more in terms of business and not necessarily just enterprise,

26
00:01:30,947 --> 00:01:36,127
500 users and above, but even the mid-market and potentially the small office,

27
00:01:36,127 --> 00:01:36,965
home office.

28
00:01:36,965 --> 00:01:39,390
You've got BitLocker whole disk encryption,

29
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:41,974
Group Policy for centralized desktop management,

30
00:01:41,974 --> 00:01:46,027
the ability to join an active directory domain services

31
00:01:46,027 --> 00:01:49,081
domain or an Azure Active Directory domain.

32
00:01:49,081 --> 00:01:52,527
Once again, the point or the theme there is centralized management.

33
00:01:52,527 --> 00:01:54,582
Remote Desktop, client-side Hyper-Virtual,

34
00:01:54,582 --> 00:01:58,310
and a more robust Windows Store experience where,

35
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:59,083
for instance,

36
00:01:59,083 --> 00:02:01,896
the administrator can control which Windows Store

37
00:02:01,896 --> 00:02:04,428
applications are available for their employees,

38
00:02:04,428 --> 00:02:07,653
and Windows Update for Business where network administrators,

39
00:02:07,653 --> 00:02:10,926
systems administrators can more granularly control how

40
00:02:10,926 --> 00:02:14,921
updates are delivered to their managed devices.

41
00:02:14,921 --> 00:02:16,823
Then we have a second layer of distinction.

42
00:02:16,823 --> 00:02:18,826
This is purely for business environments.

43
00:02:18,826 --> 00:02:23,263
You have the Windows 10 Pro verses the Windows 10 Enterprise SKUs.

44
00:02:23,263 --> 00:02:27,095
Both Pro and Enterprise offer Windows Information Protection,

45
00:02:27,095 --> 00:02:29,501
Windows Hello, Windows Store.

46
00:02:29,501 --> 00:02:32,250
We've seen some of these in the previous slide.

47
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,322
By the way,

48
00:02:33,322 --> 00:02:36,549
Windows Information Protection or WIP is the client-side component

49
00:02:36,549 --> 00:02:40,708
that's used in the system center environment or perhaps if you're

50
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:46,269
using Office 365 and Azure AD that provides data loss prevention or

51
00:02:46,269 --> 00:02:48,581
DLP protection where you have, for instance,

52
00:02:48,581 --> 00:02:52,127
business documents that may contain social security numbers,

53
00:02:52,127 --> 00:02:52,913
credit card numbers,

54
00:02:52,913 --> 00:02:56,013
and you want to make sure that your employees aren't forwarding

55
00:02:56,013 --> 00:02:59,348
those to external addresses in this kind of thing.

56
00:02:59,348 --> 00:03:02,459
Mobile Application Management is mobile device management,

57
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:05,422
but SKUed specifically towards applications.

58
00:03:05,422 --> 00:03:09,082
The Enterprise only SKUs give features like BranchCache,

59
00:03:09,082 --> 00:03:13,720
which is where you can give remote offices faster access to files by

60
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:18,155
keeping local copies or cached copies of those files in the remote office

61
00:03:18,155 --> 00:03:21,495
where the main copy exists in headquarters over,

62
00:03:21,495 --> 00:03:24,188
say, a Wide Area Network connection.

63
00:03:24,188 --> 00:03:27,373
MDOP stands for Microsoft Desktop Optimization Pack.

64
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:29,691
This has a number of enterprise tools.

65
00:03:29,691 --> 00:03:33,683
One in particular that's kind of cool is BitLocker management.

66
00:03:33,683 --> 00:03:37,986
Device and Credential Guard, ways to really lock down a system.

67
00:03:37,986 --> 00:03:42,117
Maybe your company has some kiosk PCs that public access or

68
00:03:42,117 --> 00:03:44,979
visitor or guest access is allowed on.

69
00:03:44,979 --> 00:03:47,058
Think of a hotel, that would be a good example,

70
00:03:47,058 --> 00:03:49,726
where they have a couple kiosk computers where

71
00:03:49,726 --> 00:03:52,482
customers can print their flight tickets.

72
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:52,843
Well,

73
00:03:52,843 --> 00:03:58,337
you want to be absolutely sure that only allowed code can run on those machines.

74
00:03:58,337 --> 00:04:01,043
Device Guard, Credential Guard fit into that.

75
00:04:01,043 --> 00:04:04,117
DirectAccess is a way to do virtual private networking

76
00:04:04,117 --> 00:04:06,968
without the overhead of a VPN device,

77
00:04:06,968 --> 00:04:11,303
and Cortana Management is a way to centrally manage Cortana.

78
00:04:11,303 --> 00:04:16,676
App-V and UE-V are ways to virtualize desktops or applications.

79
00:04:16,676 --> 00:04:19,817
We don't want to get too far off track here because the purpose of

80
00:04:19,817 --> 00:04:23,293
this course is specifically on the Windows 10 client.

81
00:04:23,293 --> 00:04:25,777
Those are a lot of buzzwords I just threw at you.

82
00:04:25,777 --> 00:04:28,383
Now don't expect on your exam that you're going to see

83
00:04:28,383 --> 00:04:29,771
detailed questions about any of it.

84
00:04:29,771 --> 00:04:32,265
If anything, it's just going to be a recognition thing,

85
00:04:32,265 --> 00:04:35,199
where you recognize a feature and say, oh yeah,

86
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,907
that's Enterprise only, or this over here is available in home,

87
00:04:38,907 --> 00:04:40,187
this kind of stuff.

88
00:04:40,187 --> 00:04:42,108
To sum up these two slides,

89
00:04:42,108 --> 00:04:53,000
home you have much less emphasis on centralized control. Pro and enterprise increasing and maximized emphasis on centralized control.
