1
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:07,350
Let me go to Settings to verify who I'm logged in as.

2
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:11,465
It looks like I'm logged on as just an ordinary personal user.

3
00:00:11,465 --> 00:00:12,910
There's an Auto Save tab.

4
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:16,225
Choose where you want to save your desktop documents and pictures.

5
00:00:16,225 --> 00:00:20,273
I have them set to the PC instead of OneDrive because File

6
00:00:20,273 --> 00:00:23,106
History has already taken care of those files,

7
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:25,771
so I'm glad I have that level of support.

8
00:00:25,771 --> 00:00:28,749
If we right-click OneDrive, let me open my OneDrive folder,

9
00:00:28,749 --> 00:00:33,110
and if I go into Documents, I have a Calendar 2016.

10
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:35,678
docx file that I'll delete.

11
00:00:35,678 --> 00:00:38,060
It tells us the file will be deleted from your PC,

12
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:40,562
but you may be able to restore it from the web,

13
00:00:40,562 --> 00:00:42,453
are you sure you want to do this?

14
00:00:42,453 --> 00:00:43,575
I'm going to say Yes.

15
00:00:43,575 --> 00:00:47,776
So now this is going to sync to all my devices, but let me try that again.

16
00:00:47,776 --> 00:00:51,835
Open your OneDrive folder, go to Documents, I no longer have that calendar.

17
00:00:51,835 --> 00:00:54,549
To do restores from OneDrive, as I said,

18
00:00:54,549 --> 00:00:58,327
you have to go to the web, so let's right-click and go to View Online.

19
00:00:58,327 --> 00:00:59,080
Edge appears,

20
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:04,030
and it's going to pop into either OneDrive for Business or OneDrive personal,

21
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:05,609
depending upon your account.

22
00:01:05,609 --> 00:01:06,774
I'm at OneDrive personal.

23
00:01:06,774 --> 00:01:11,703
And if I go to the Recycle bin, sure enough is see Calendar 2016.

24
00:01:11,703 --> 00:01:12,137
docx.

25
00:01:12,137 --> 00:01:16,182
I can select that file and restore it from the Recycle bin,

26
00:01:16,182 --> 00:01:20,103
and now it should show up in my files list in my Documents folder.

27
00:01:20,103 --> 00:01:21,433
Yep, here it is.

28
00:01:21,433 --> 00:01:24,450
The nice thing about OneDrive on the web is that you have

29
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:27,202
browser-based access to the major Office applications,

30
00:01:27,202 --> 00:01:29,003
in this case Word Online.

31
00:01:29,003 --> 00:01:33,040
And if I come back to my OneDrive client and open the folder,

32
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,878
go to Documents, I have my Calendar back.

33
00:01:35,878 --> 00:01:36,942
Pretty nifty, huh?

34
00:01:36,942 --> 00:01:39,597
The other thing, like I said, deals with versioning,

35
00:01:39,597 --> 00:01:42,777
and if you right-click a file in your OneDrive web

36
00:01:42,777 --> 00:01:44,744
portal and go to Version History,

37
00:01:44,744 --> 00:01:47,886
it'll show you any versions created for those files.

38
00:01:47,886 --> 00:01:50,185
I don't know if have versions for any of these.

39
00:01:50,185 --> 00:01:52,415
Not all of them have versioning enabled.

40
00:01:52,415 --> 00:01:55,838
Let me see, I did a Microsoft Virtual Academy course,

41
00:01:55,838 --> 00:01:59,021
does this have a version history, let's see.

42
00:01:59,021 --> 00:01:59,699
Now, it doesn't.

43
00:01:59,699 --> 00:02:00,602
How about this PowerPoint?

44
00:02:00,602 --> 00:02:02,390
Does that have a version history?

45
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:04,178
If it's a recognized file type,

46
00:02:04,178 --> 00:02:08,579
notice that the version browser actually pops open in a separate tab.

47
00:02:08,579 --> 00:02:09,838
You get the idea though.

48
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:11,853
If we had multiple versions of the file,

49
00:02:11,853 --> 00:02:17,704
we would be able to preview, download, save to OneDrive that particular version.

50
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:21,176
So you get the best fidelity with office documents, as you see.

51
00:02:21,176 --> 00:02:23,803
I opened up the version history for this Word file,

52
00:02:23,803 --> 00:02:26,795
and again, I just have one version, but you get the idea.

53
00:02:26,795 --> 00:02:27,706
Long story short,

54
00:02:27,706 --> 00:02:31,726
what you're going to have in your OneDrive is version history over time,

55
00:02:31,726 --> 00:02:39,000
and then the Recycle bin and the capacity to recover from it subject to retention policies.
