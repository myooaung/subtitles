00:01.530 --> 00:02.580
Hello everybody.

00:02.580 --> 00:05.030
Welcome back to this new case study.

00:05.040 --> 00:12.150
Today we're going to begin a new study on predicting the likelihood of signing a loan based on financial

00:12.150 --> 00:13.160
history.

00:13.240 --> 00:13.630
Foolish.

00:13.680 --> 00:15.520
Jump into it.

00:15.660 --> 00:20.490
Let me give you an introduction of where we're coming from when we're going to start building this model

00:21.390 --> 00:28.170
now lending companies work by analyzing the financial history of their loan applicants and they choose

00:28.560 --> 00:31.520
whether or not the applicant is risky or not too risky.

00:31.530 --> 00:38.920
And if they're not risky at all then they give them a loan and determine the terms of the law not to

00:38.930 --> 00:40.230
acquire these applicants.

00:40.230 --> 00:44.880
Companies can of course just organically wait for them to come to them through their website or mobile

00:44.880 --> 00:50.850
app or they can set up advertisement campaigns to reach out to those possible applicants.

00:50.950 --> 00:59.770
Other times lending companies partners with P2P lending marketplaces these P2P marketplaces are Web

00:59.840 --> 01:07.170
sites or companies that receive a lot of loan applications and who serve as intermediaries to link these

01:07.170 --> 01:10.390
applicants to lending companies.

01:10.380 --> 01:14.540
Now some of those examples of the marketplaces that we see in the market right now are of course lending

01:14.580 --> 01:16.760
three upstart Lending Club.

01:16.780 --> 01:22.710
And there is a lot of money more that you can find in this project we're going to assess the quality

01:22.710 --> 01:27.960
of the leads our company receives from these marketplaces by predicting whether or not they're going

01:27.960 --> 01:33.480
to reach a particular screen in our board process and we'll go into detail what all that means in a

01:33.480 --> 01:35.050
second.

01:35.070 --> 01:42.830
Now let's summarize this the market in which we're working is the set of all applicants who reached

01:42.870 --> 01:50.890
out through an intermediary marketplace so all the applicants are coming through these P2P lending marketplaces.

01:51.360 --> 01:52.860
The product itself is just a lot.

01:52.860 --> 01:58.100
There's nothing special about this is we're one of them a good loan something they are satisfied with.

01:58.110 --> 02:04.050
But in this particular project we're not all concerned with the product itself we're concerned with

02:04.050 --> 02:07.210
the quality of the applicants that we're getting.

02:07.830 --> 02:14.250
Now the exact goal of the model is to develop a model of course to predict the quality of applicants

02:14.260 --> 02:19.810
so in this case we're calling quality applicants as those who reach a particular screen.

02:19.880 --> 02:21.910
Onboarding process the application process.

02:21.930 --> 02:22.440
OK.

02:22.650 --> 02:29.430
So if her reach that particular screen then we know it's a person who's very interested in the loan

02:29.700 --> 02:31.960
and we can consider them as quality applicants.

02:32.160 --> 02:36.320
Now when you're working and Vindex and you're building models while you can define quality however you

02:36.330 --> 02:36.680
want.

02:36.690 --> 02:37.100
You can.

02:37.140 --> 02:42.060
You can define quality as applicants who get the loan applicants who pay off the loan.

02:42.060 --> 02:42.930
These are the sort.

02:42.930 --> 02:47.250
In this case we're only focused on the onboarding process so our quality our definition of quality is

02:47.250 --> 02:53.070
going to be people who reach the esign in part of our onboarding process.

02:53.070 --> 02:55.690
So let's go into a little more detail now.

02:55.750 --> 03:03.060
Now in this business challenge we're working for a finta company want to specialize on loans and it

03:03.060 --> 03:05.770
offers low HPR loans to are applicants.

03:05.790 --> 03:09.500
And of course it is based on financial habits like any lending company would do.

03:09.540 --> 03:13.830
All of them will look at your financial history and decide whether or not you are a person they can

03:13.830 --> 03:15.320
give a loan to.

03:15.580 --> 03:20.490
Now the company that you're working with has partner with AP to be lending marketplace of course like

03:20.490 --> 03:28.740
we described before and we see that the conversions the successful loans given to people coming from

03:28.740 --> 03:30.720
this marketplace are pretty satisfactory.

03:30.750 --> 03:33.060
So we're now going to focus on that part.

03:33.330 --> 03:39.530
What we're going to focus on is on the onboarding process and improve the onboarding process.

03:39.600 --> 03:45.300
So the company is giving you a task to create a model to predict whether or not the Leitz will complete

03:45.300 --> 03:49.330
the electronic signature phase of the on board and process the loan application process right.

03:49.770 --> 03:55.650
We call this action of Capelli electronic signature and it is signed.

03:55.650 --> 04:01.070
So if the user has esign then he has finished this particular step.

04:01.080 --> 04:06.270
So now the reason the company tasked with this is because they want to leverage this model put it into

04:06.270 --> 04:12.840
file which applicants all which come in applicants from these P2P marketplaces are less quality.

04:12.840 --> 04:17.350
Meaning that they are not likely to be interested enough with onboarding process.

04:17.420 --> 04:21.900
What they see when they come to us to even finalize their application.

04:22.290 --> 04:27.990
And of course this is way before we decide or not to give them a loan or what terms to give them.

04:27.990 --> 04:34.800
So let's go into a little more detail now that there is a reason why in this project we select the signing

04:34.800 --> 04:41.410
process and to understand that let me give you a quick description of how the funnel looks.

04:41.460 --> 04:50.560
And in this process of so the way this process works the way it final structure is and the following

04:51.700 --> 04:55.310
not applicants will come to this P2P marketplaces.

04:55.310 --> 05:00.760
They will give someone the information so that they can be given different suggestions or what laws

05:00.800 --> 05:02.010
makes sense for them.

05:02.110 --> 05:07.220
But before they're given those suggestions that information is processed by the marketplace and is given

05:07.220 --> 05:13.610
to lending companies like us lending then companies will sometimes bid different marketplaces and different

05:13.610 --> 05:20.750
structures but we will decide whether or not to accept this lead and what it might have real state in

05:20.750 --> 05:23.860
that list or resold that the loan applicants get.

05:24.530 --> 05:30.110
So if the loan applicant decides to click on our particular offer as compared to the other offers he

05:30.110 --> 05:36.560
has available then they arrive into our website or mobile app whatever that is and begin the actual

05:36.560 --> 05:38.240
official application process.

05:38.480 --> 05:42.500
And this is what we're trying to gauge the application process is what we're trying to do.

05:42.510 --> 05:45.750
Judge if it's effective or not.

05:46.190 --> 05:53.720
So in the application process the user gives us some extra information some redundant information as

05:53.720 --> 05:54.600
well.

05:55.040 --> 06:01.760
And they start going to screen by screen filling out different details until they reached the final

06:01.760 --> 06:08.060
step of the screen the esign interface that you sign in screen and they decide whether or not they want

06:08.060 --> 06:13.950
to finalize their application and whether or not all the information they have given is correct.

06:14.420 --> 06:20.960
So if they e-zine that means that they have been interested enough in getting that loan that they have

06:21.170 --> 06:23.510
filled out all the necessary information.

06:23.900 --> 06:32.830
Now because any of the in screens post the e-zine and screen like we are now we accept the application

06:32.870 --> 06:39.980
or what are the terms of the loan and things like that because all of those things are decided by the

06:39.980 --> 06:41.240
company itself.

06:41.720 --> 06:47.260
And they are not a real sign or whether or not the applicant is interested anymore.

06:47.350 --> 06:54.740
Now that's more of a topic of how our decision making models are structure and how we decide to give

06:54.740 --> 06:57.380
in terms how do we decide to accept a loan applicant.

06:57.380 --> 07:02.130
But that's not what we're focused on here in this project we're focusing on the onboarding process.

07:02.180 --> 07:09.260
So we only care about all the screens in which the applicant has full control and that symp all this

07:09.360 --> 07:13.790
means that the payout whether or not the applicant is interested in the loan and that culminates with

07:13.790 --> 07:15.460
the signing screen.

07:15.620 --> 07:17.860
So that's what we're going to gauge here.

07:17.900 --> 07:21.290
We're going to gauge if a user is quality.

07:21.290 --> 07:27.470
Meaning that if the user is interested enough to reach that final plus of the onboarding process.

07:27.500 --> 07:28.180
Okay.

07:28.760 --> 07:36.350
So in the next PTO I'm going to go over that data and some other fields and I'm going to give you both.

07:36.350 --> 07:43.260
It is scription of the data and we are actually going to also go in to the columns and see how that

07:43.260 --> 07:44.390
it is structured.

07:44.900 --> 07:47.920
Thank you very much for watching and see you in the next video.
