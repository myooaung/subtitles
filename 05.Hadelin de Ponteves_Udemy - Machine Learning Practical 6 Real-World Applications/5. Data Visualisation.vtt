WEBVTT

00:05.700 --> 00:06.160
All right.

00:06.160 --> 00:11.770
So let's take a look at the Jupiter notebook that we were going to basically use to develop our machine

00:11.770 --> 00:19.330
learning algorithm where we can at classify again cancer into all tumors into malignant or benign cancers.

00:19.330 --> 00:22.930
Here are just in to kind of a quick description of the problem statement.

00:22.930 --> 00:28.930
Again we have our feature sets we have certain features and kind of know what occurred are presenting

00:28.930 --> 00:34.050
the different characteristics of the cell of the nucleus that we are in out of the patient.

00:34.180 --> 00:40.870
So we have radious texture perimeter area smoothness and so on and data sets in general they are linearly

00:40.870 --> 00:41.760
separable.

00:41.850 --> 00:42.470
OK.

00:42.790 --> 00:49.120
And they have we have 569 instances and classes they are divided into two hundred and twelve malignant

00:49.300 --> 00:52.290
cases and 357 benign cases.

00:52.360 --> 00:55.360
OK so in total we're going to be five hundred and sixty nine.

00:55.360 --> 00:58.400
And again the target class we're going to be either malignant or benign.

00:58.630 --> 00:59.050
All right.

00:59.140 --> 01:03.350
You guys can download the data set if you follow that link or you can.

01:03.350 --> 01:04.670
Again are going to show you.

01:04.690 --> 01:08.060
We're going to use the Eski learn to actually load our data.

01:08.070 --> 01:08.680
All right.

01:09.070 --> 01:09.910
So let's get started.

01:09.910 --> 01:13.480
So first step is we can import all the libraries that we need.

01:13.720 --> 01:14.090
OK.

01:14.110 --> 01:23.370
So first step is going to import pandas as speedy panda so pandas mainly can be used as a library that

01:23.380 --> 01:26.170
can be used for data manipulation using data frames.

01:26.380 --> 01:29.890
It's kind of you know like kind of Excel basically for Python.

01:29.890 --> 01:30.680
All right.

01:30.760 --> 01:38.960
And the next step we're going to import some pie as umpire can be used for data statistical analysis.

01:39.100 --> 01:39.920
Right.

01:40.090 --> 01:44.150
And then moving forward we're going to import math plug lead.

01:44.240 --> 01:51.650
Matt Laclede dot PI plot as well.

01:51.840 --> 01:52.730
Okay.

01:53.040 --> 01:56.280
And then afterwards we can import what we call it Seaborn.

01:56.280 --> 01:59.210
Again map plot label can be used for data visualization.

01:59.220 --> 02:03.030
And we going to use kind of a library that we call it seaborne which is good.

02:03.030 --> 02:04.050
It's very powerful.

02:04.050 --> 02:09.420
When we do statistical data visualization I'm going to show you the power and the beauty of C-Boomer

02:10.290 --> 02:11.370
as we move forward.

02:11.640 --> 02:17.870
OK so going to import seaborne as asinus.

02:17.900 --> 02:18.440
Right.

02:18.720 --> 02:20.090
That's pretty much the first step.

02:20.090 --> 02:26.990
Let's run the cell so we once would undersell it tells us OK that means here it's loading.

02:27.240 --> 02:29.090
And we're good.

02:29.110 --> 02:31.140
OK so once you see the number that means we're good.

02:31.230 --> 02:34.550
The next step is we're going to actually lower the actual cancer data sets.

02:34.770 --> 02:39.720
So we're going to say from Skillern that data sets

02:42.290 --> 02:49.120
imports we're going to load the data called Load breast cancers are going to load underscore breasts

02:49.420 --> 02:53.380
underscore cancer cancer.

02:54.260 --> 02:55.250
That's the first step.

02:55.250 --> 03:00.160
So that window the data first and then second step we can actually kind of think an instance of that

03:00.180 --> 03:01.760
low bed low breast cancer.

03:01.760 --> 03:09.500
So going do cancer equals we're going to take simply the last breath care that breast cancer can see

03:09.500 --> 03:10.010
here.

03:10.080 --> 03:11.470
I'm just going to take an instance of it.

03:11.540 --> 03:12.640
Let's run it.

03:12.750 --> 03:14.690
Now we have our cancer information.

03:14.690 --> 03:16.290
OK that's all pretty much the data.

03:16.400 --> 03:18.280
Let's take a look at it let's view it.

03:18.600 --> 03:22.510
So again just from the cell that we showed us basically OK.

03:22.520 --> 03:26.990
So we have the data that's kind of all the numbers that we have all the features we have all the target

03:26.990 --> 03:32.460
data showing is a zero or one showing simply if the cancer is malignant or benign.

03:32.810 --> 03:36.540
And here we're just you know a bunch of like messed up information as you can see here.

03:36.680 --> 03:40.490
So let's see how can we view the data in a better better format.

03:40.490 --> 03:43.740
So if we click a that will simply create more cells.

03:43.740 --> 03:47.330
So here is just going to be creating a couple of newer cells.

03:47.330 --> 03:52.800
All right so the next step is we wanted to see OK the keys within the cancer.

03:52.840 --> 03:53.070
OK.

03:53.090 --> 03:55.640
Let's see that the kind of the titles OK.

03:55.910 --> 03:57.620
Are the keys within that dictionary.

03:57.680 --> 04:03.940
So we're going to do is going to say cancer dot keys and that will tell us pretty much what column that

04:03.950 --> 04:05.760
we have or what dictionaries do we have.

04:05.920 --> 04:12.050
So we have the data we have our target our target names which is kind of the title of the target which

04:12.050 --> 04:15.270
is simply going to be malignant or benign description.

04:15.270 --> 04:18.880
I'm going to tell us all the description of the data and then we're going to have all the feature names

04:18.890 --> 04:23.060
which is the actual feature names kind of you know radius perimeter and so on so forth.

04:23.120 --> 04:25.670
OK so let's print them know one by one.

04:25.750 --> 04:25.960
OK.

04:25.970 --> 04:31.970
So the first up we're going to print right brain cancer and then we're going to do it that we're going

04:31.970 --> 04:35.240
to select the description section described.

04:35.270 --> 04:41.640
OK let's click run and once we see here it's actually going to show you now the information that wanted

04:41.640 --> 04:42.590
to view earlier.

04:42.590 --> 04:48.050
But in a better format it's really just going to show you more of instance we have women and 69 attributes

04:48.050 --> 04:48.760
30.

04:49.130 --> 04:56.190
And if you guys can see this or the other information radius and so forth if you scroll down which would

04:56.190 --> 05:01.490
show the class malignant or benign and if you go down it will just going to show you or the min max

05:01.550 --> 05:06.230
or the values or the minimax of the values basically going to show you here all the references you know

05:06.230 --> 05:08.880
like the date 1995 and so on and so forth.

05:08.920 --> 05:09.360
OK.

05:09.570 --> 05:10.940
It's kind of a quick description.

05:10.940 --> 05:12.390
Let's do the same as well.

05:12.440 --> 05:12.700
Right.

05:12.710 --> 05:13.540
So let's get going.

05:13.580 --> 05:15.330
So let's print.

05:15.400 --> 05:22.870
Are we're going to do that we're going to print cancer but we are going to select instead our targets.

05:22.920 --> 05:23.520
OK.

05:23.610 --> 05:27.390
So we're going to have targets and we're going to run it that we're simply going to show us all the

05:27.390 --> 05:32.590
data all the information that's kind of the target class which will treat either 0 or 1.

05:32.970 --> 05:39.300
Well again we're going to do prints and we can open and thinking about cancer and then we're going to

05:39.300 --> 05:46.620
select simply the target names target underscore the names that will tell us OK either we have two classes

05:46.620 --> 05:47.570
of malignant or benign.

05:47.730 --> 05:48.300
OK.

05:48.750 --> 05:49.550
One more time.

05:49.590 --> 05:59.460
But for the feature names so let's print and then we can write cancer sorry cancer and then we are going

05:59.460 --> 06:10.660
to select simply our feature names so we can write feature underscore names that will tell us simply

06:10.670 --> 06:13.430
all the features names that we have so I mean radious infection and so on so forth.

06:13.490 --> 06:14.140
OK.

06:14.510 --> 06:15.210
All right so what.

06:15.260 --> 06:19.690
What if we wanted to look at the for example the shape of the of the data.

06:19.910 --> 06:21.120
So we could do with it right.

06:21.140 --> 06:22.430
Again cancer.

06:22.850 --> 06:29.530
And then we're going to select the actual data which is simply color and we call it data and then we

06:29.530 --> 06:33.500
could apply a method for shape that can tell us what's the shape of it.

06:33.500 --> 06:37.920
So here we have as we expected we have five hundred and sixty nine.

06:38.130 --> 06:44.470
OK gross or datasets and have three columns three columns indicating three features.

06:44.480 --> 06:45.500
Simply put.

06:45.500 --> 06:46.310
Right.

06:46.440 --> 06:51.770
So the first step is what we're going to do in order to deal with the data and a much easier way we're

06:51.770 --> 06:53.420
going to create a data frame.

06:53.540 --> 06:54.060
OK.

06:54.230 --> 07:00.050
When you say data frame it would make our life ten times easier when we seem to use Pandurs data frame

07:00.350 --> 07:01.930
to actually present the data.

07:02.120 --> 07:04.740
And let's see how can we how can we do this.

07:04.940 --> 07:09.330
So simply what we could do actually have the command right here.

07:09.530 --> 07:15.830
So we could do that we could try PD the data frame that would create a data frame out of our cancer

07:15.830 --> 07:18.140
data and the target data.

07:18.140 --> 07:24.680
So here we're going to specify cancer data and target which means that we're going to include 30 columns

07:25.160 --> 07:30.050
of all the data we have and then can add an additional column which the first column that includes a

07:30.050 --> 07:34.850
target data which is kind of you know we didn't get include all the training that has all the inputs

07:34.850 --> 07:38.560
and outputs in just in one kind of data frame.

07:38.900 --> 07:39.220
Right.

07:39.230 --> 07:44.350
And here we're going to mention columns when I specify the columns are going to specify and P-doc append.

07:44.450 --> 07:50.100
We're going to use append which is simply just to append two vectors or two columns together.

07:50.150 --> 07:54.440
So we're going to have cancel that feature names and then we have target as well.

07:54.440 --> 08:01.160
All right let's run this command that will simply create a data frame we call it the f underscore cancer.

08:01.290 --> 08:03.210
Right let's explore the data.

08:03.260 --> 08:10.490
So if we write an IDF underscore cancer OK and let's say we specify I want to look at the first couple

08:10.490 --> 08:13.310
of the titles and the first couple of rows.

08:13.370 --> 08:14.190
OK.

08:14.210 --> 08:17.840
So for a head that would actually tell us OK so here we have the radius.

08:18.020 --> 08:20.710
I mean texture I mean perimeter and so on.

08:20.750 --> 08:24.740
And if we keep going that will tell us the target as well which is pretty cool.

08:24.740 --> 08:31.880
So now we have all our 30 basically features along with the target which is along with the goal or the

08:31.880 --> 08:34.360
objective that we wanted to implement.

08:34.380 --> 08:34.990
Right.

08:35.370 --> 08:35.670
OK.

08:35.700 --> 08:41.120
What if I wanted to simply look at the f cancer as well but I don't want to look again let's create

08:41.120 --> 08:44.900
some yourselves in here and let's instead of creating the head.

08:44.910 --> 08:45.850
Let's look at the tail.

08:45.860 --> 08:48.410
Let's look at the end of it actually that makes sense.

08:48.410 --> 08:53.350
We have five hundred and sixteen hundred sixty eight and we have 31 columns again.

08:53.660 --> 08:56.240
If we scroll down here again we'll see all the data.

08:56.260 --> 08:59.350
But that's when looking at the last samples basically.

08:59.360 --> 09:00.040
All right.

09:00.410 --> 09:01.180
Okay great.

09:01.490 --> 09:03.980
That's pretty much all what we need to load the data.

09:04.010 --> 09:08.750
The next step is that we want it to actually just going to go and delete all the cells should we need

09:08.750 --> 09:10.100
them.

09:10.090 --> 09:14.130
So let's take a look at how can we visualize that they're going to do.

09:14.130 --> 09:20.570
They're going to use pair plot count plot and scatterplot to actually view all the data using the seaborne

09:20.870 --> 09:21.690
library.

09:22.010 --> 09:23.810
So first let's try the plot.

09:23.820 --> 09:28.090
I'm going to give you just know run it first just to give an idea of what you know what purpose does.

09:28.100 --> 09:29.160
It's really powerful.

09:29.240 --> 09:31.850
I'll give you one one stop shop.

09:31.850 --> 09:35.420
A quick glance at the entire data in one place.

09:35.450 --> 09:36.200
So let's get started.

09:36.190 --> 09:43.130
So we're going to do is going right as soon as that pair the pair plot and we're going to do with going

09:43.130 --> 09:46.870
rate IDF cancer that we're going to call our data free.

09:46.910 --> 09:50.870
All going to do that we're going to use simply what variables do we need.

09:50.930 --> 09:51.460
OK.

09:51.710 --> 09:52.700
So what are we going to do.

09:52.720 --> 09:56.190
They're going right VAR's which is all the variables that we want.

09:56.360 --> 09:56.770
OK.

09:56.770 --> 09:58.890
I'm not going to plot all the 30 samples.

09:58.980 --> 10:01.310
I was going to plotless say the first five for six.

10:01.500 --> 10:01.800
OK.

10:01.820 --> 10:02.750
Have them copied here.

10:02.750 --> 10:07.120
So we're going to just going into the mean radius mean textures mean area I mean primitive means smooth

10:07.130 --> 10:08.210
this.

10:08.660 --> 10:09.790
One variable that we need.

10:09.800 --> 10:14.760
Let's actually let's go unplug this first and to see what's going to happen.

10:14.860 --> 10:20.360
I can see here it's actually really powerful because I can see it just shows you like kind of a one

10:21.140 --> 10:27.770
step or the relationship between the mean radius or the value that we chose along with the mean smoothness

10:27.770 --> 10:29.690
mean perimeter of an area and so on.

10:30.080 --> 10:35.030
So the only problem is we can actually view the data and just looks fine to me but the only problem

10:35.030 --> 10:36.890
is doesn't show the target class.

10:37.010 --> 10:43.030
It doesn't show the actual decay which one of these samples is malignant and which one of them is benign.

10:43.070 --> 10:44.520
So what are we going to do instead.

10:44.520 --> 10:49.390
We can actually write in a select call here which is specify the target class.

10:49.660 --> 10:53.280
So we're gonna write H U E equals going to specify.

10:53.310 --> 10:55.450
They use the column which is.

10:56.010 --> 11:02.270
OK to simply specify that we're going to use the target column which is simply this column right here

11:02.810 --> 11:04.700
which indicates if it's 0 or 1.

11:04.790 --> 11:05.220
OK.

11:05.290 --> 11:10.170
As kind of the heat which is indicating the culture let's run this and see what's going to happen.

11:11.950 --> 11:13.150
Well actually that's pretty much it.

11:13.150 --> 11:17.020
It's way better so as you can see here it's been classified as well.

11:17.020 --> 11:17.310
So.

11:17.340 --> 11:19.280
OK the target if it's 0 or 1.

11:19.520 --> 11:23.430
So zero indicates malignant and one indicates benign.

11:23.500 --> 11:30.360
What I mean by this is the blue points in here that's the malignant case that's mean the kind of his

11:30.370 --> 11:34.940
feet severe case or like the life threatening case per se.

11:34.960 --> 11:40.180
So here you will see that the main area for instance for malignant cases a little bit more compared

11:40.180 --> 11:46.730
to the the benign cases the mean perimeter a little bit more you see that the kind of the the the the

11:46.740 --> 11:48.990
mean area here is a little bit more.

11:49.160 --> 11:51.260
You can see that even the distribution.

11:51.280 --> 11:56.550
So this is kind of a distribution that shows you the distribution of samples for the mean radius.

11:56.770 --> 12:01.870
You can see that the radius for the malignant cases actually more is actually higher.

12:01.950 --> 12:07.430
And if you refer back to the images that we had before actually let's go and view the images.

12:07.430 --> 12:16.080
So if you go back to the images you will find that the malignant cases actually make mix a little bit

12:16.860 --> 12:17.940
of sense of the tumor.

12:17.940 --> 12:19.560
This is kind of the malignant cases.

12:19.770 --> 12:23.660
You see the cells a little bit like you know like bigger per se.

12:23.970 --> 12:29.010
And these are the areas little bit bigger here it's kind of a little bit more uniform a little bit small

12:29.430 --> 12:31.060
here for the benign cases.

12:31.090 --> 12:31.720
Right.

12:32.160 --> 12:33.000
OK.

12:33.660 --> 12:36.880
The next step is that we're going to use the ascent as well.

12:37.080 --> 12:38.060
Good luck with the seaborne.

12:38.070 --> 12:39.600
Would he use the counterplot.

12:39.600 --> 12:40.300
OK.

12:40.310 --> 12:40.850
So right.

12:40.960 --> 12:41.360
Right.

12:41.370 --> 12:46.050
S and s dot count plot and are going to do.

12:46.050 --> 12:52.560
They're going to call the data frame which is again DFI underscore cancer the underscore cancer and

12:52.560 --> 12:59.850
organ and choose simply we're going to choose the targets to an account with how many samples is zero

13:00.120 --> 13:01.140
and how many samples is one.

13:01.140 --> 13:03.920
Just to give you kind of visualization we know the samples beforehand.

13:03.930 --> 13:05.680
We just want to look at Adam.

13:05.850 --> 13:06.160
Right.

13:06.210 --> 13:07.840
So we're going to do is going to have cancer.

13:07.890 --> 13:12.070
And then we're going to use simply the target colon to do with the counting.

13:12.080 --> 13:12.830
All right.

13:13.230 --> 13:13.510
OK.

13:13.530 --> 13:14.670
Let's run it.

13:15.070 --> 13:15.420
OK.

13:15.420 --> 13:16.630
This is a classic.

13:16.700 --> 13:17.010
OK.

13:17.010 --> 13:22.050
This is the only one we know that the malignant cases are down 200 samples.

13:22.080 --> 13:28.170
And the benign cases is that one hundred and fifty samples in total Csound five hundred and sixty somersaulting.

13:28.170 --> 13:28.700
OK.

13:29.000 --> 13:29.800
All right.

13:30.120 --> 13:30.930
Let's keep going.

13:30.930 --> 13:35.640
So the next step is are we going right or going to just take maybe one of these like graphs and see

13:35.640 --> 13:41.330
how can we plot it so we're going to use as an ass again seaborne but we're going to use the scatterplot.

13:41.350 --> 13:41.940
Right.

13:42.310 --> 13:49.600
So going write going right as soon as that scatter plot and we're going to do.

13:49.640 --> 13:52.950
We're going to select which what we want to plot on the x axis.

13:53.100 --> 13:58.350
We're going to plot on the y axis what Hugh we're going to be selecting and what's data free and that

13:58.350 --> 14:00.110
we need to be selecting basically.

14:00.190 --> 14:02.010
So the first step is going to write x.

14:02.040 --> 14:06.110
Let's say we're going to print let's say the mean Area mean area.

14:06.460 --> 14:07.120
OK.

14:07.440 --> 14:15.600
And we wanted to plug the Y which is going to be mean smoothness per se means smoothness and we want

14:15.600 --> 14:16.710
to applaud the hewe.

14:16.710 --> 14:24.960
We're going to be my target and we need to select what data what's the date of the meeting we just simply

14:24.960 --> 14:27.520
that we're the interface which is the underscore of cancer.

14:27.840 --> 14:29.980
All right let's run this.

14:30.020 --> 14:34.940
And that's pretty much our scatterplot which is pretty interesting to me that the main area I mean smoothness

14:34.940 --> 14:36.320
and which are the target class.

14:36.360 --> 14:37.010
Right.

14:37.490 --> 14:40.850
OK what if I wanted to select the correlation.

14:41.000 --> 14:46.600
For example I want to just just run maybe one command that can tell is TELL ME OK how these columns

14:46.600 --> 14:53.810
hold these features are correlated so what we can do is that we could use the seaborne heat map as follows

14:53.810 --> 14:54.050
suit.

14:54.050 --> 15:00.110
So it just started as an ass heat map and we're going to do that we're going to call the data frame

15:00.110 --> 15:08.430
the underscore cancer and we're going to apply a method that we call correlation which is c o w r the

15:08.440 --> 15:16.310
basic is just our simple method and simply to plot our heat map what we're going to do that we because

15:16.310 --> 15:21.560
we want it to plot as well the values or the numbers of correlation we give you the notation we can

15:21.560 --> 15:24.010
apply to activate and make it true.

15:24.360 --> 15:27.950
Let's run this and sticking.

15:27.950 --> 15:30.130
See it's little bit like messed up in here.

15:30.170 --> 15:33.890
So what we're going to do instead we're going to change the size because we are plotting so many different

15:33.890 --> 15:34.620
samples.

15:34.830 --> 15:39.280
We're going to do with going to use the figure size to actually adjust the size of the figure.

15:39.590 --> 15:42.300
So we're get to use plots that figure.

15:42.740 --> 15:51.250
And we're going to set the figure size into let's say 20 and 10 for example 20 and 10.

15:51.450 --> 15:51.880
OK.

15:52.170 --> 15:53.090
Let's run it.

15:56.480 --> 15:57.640
That's much better.

15:58.070 --> 16:01.790
So this is pretty much the overall view of the correlation of the data.

16:01.800 --> 16:03.380
So here we have our three features.

16:03.450 --> 16:10.700
We have our three features and you'll see that simply we have you know point nine nine value for example

16:10.710 --> 16:14.450
between the mean area and the mean perimeter which means that there's a very high correlation between

16:14.450 --> 16:15.500
the two.

16:15.530 --> 16:20.180
Here we have between let's say the mean radius and the mean area there is a very high correlation and

16:20.180 --> 16:25.250
so on you guys can just go through with the the coalition to give you an overview of the correlation

16:25.250 --> 16:26.420
values between the data.

16:26.420 --> 16:26.910
All right.

16:27.260 --> 16:29.420
That's all we have for the data visualization.

16:29.450 --> 16:30.550
Let me recap.

16:30.710 --> 16:35.720
So first of all we use peer flautist to plot to plot basically all the correlations or all the relationships

16:35.720 --> 16:37.900
between the different variables.

16:38.060 --> 16:44.450
And then we use counterplot to count the samples we use scatterplot just to plot specific two variables.

16:44.450 --> 16:48.770
So is this the target class and then we use the correlations to actually show me the different correlations

16:48.770 --> 16:50.130
between our features.

16:50.150 --> 16:52.580
I hope you guys enjoy that section and see in the next section.
