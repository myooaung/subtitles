00:05.880 --> 00:08.520
An unbalanced data set.

00:08.650 --> 00:11.830
So we need to apply some sampling techniques.

00:11.830 --> 00:14.360
We need to get creative on this.

00:14.590 --> 00:18.830
Let's go over first what is sampling Exactly.

00:18.850 --> 00:21.940
There are different sampling techniques we can apply.

00:22.030 --> 00:27.970
Basically we can classify those in under sampling or oversampling.

00:28.140 --> 00:33.500
Suppose we covered that composed by six mates of three females.

00:33.500 --> 00:41.730
The data set is clearly on balance if we understand all that said we could get free females and free

00:41.720 --> 00:49.990
out of the six mates we would be using the information and sometimes valuable information on the other

00:49.990 --> 00:57.610
hand if we are a sample that said we would get all the six males and we would need to duplicate their

00:57.610 --> 00:58.580
three females.

00:58.600 --> 01:06.480
So we call it balance we would be creating and accessing information if we decide to and there are some

01:06.520 --> 01:12.760
people we will need to define which information we will do in our training process.

01:12.760 --> 01:16.990
Usually we do this by just doing a random sample.

01:16.990 --> 01:20.000
But this is not always the case.

01:20.290 --> 01:28.710
The information that you have left after DNA sample should be representative of the entire data set.

01:28.900 --> 01:36.940
On the other hand if our sample we would need to create new information a possible oversampled technique

01:37.100 --> 01:46.060
is called smart and we will be using these for our problem small synthetic minority or sambal technique

01:46.750 --> 01:49.570
to get an idea of how small it works.

01:49.590 --> 01:54.340
It just create a new vector between two existing data points.

01:54.490 --> 02:02.350
For example in the picture that we're seeing your end point I created based on that by Boynes.

02:02.390 --> 02:09.070
That we know what our Something options are let's apply them to our problem to see if we can improve

02:09.260 --> 02:11.560
our performance.
