Hello and welcome back.

00:02.820 --> 00:05.450
Now we're going to go over the same problem.

00:05.880 --> 00:12.630
We're going to be using the same first part of the Jupiter notebook we used in previous years but now

00:12.630 --> 00:15.020
we're going to apply decision trees.

00:15.090 --> 00:19.540
That's another possible machine learning classification along with.

00:19.830 --> 00:28.440
Let's start by commenting our code rule then import that decision tree classifier that is already implemented

00:28.440 --> 00:31.310
for us in the psyche library.

00:32.890 --> 00:42.470
We will also create a new decision tree classifier and put that into a bio called Decision Tree.

00:42.580 --> 00:52.900
We will also trying using different methods say must be for this we need the x train y train Bibles

00:54.390 --> 00:59.170
we will need to transform the Y trend Bael into a valid input.

01:02.400 --> 01:06.880
You will see that it will only need a few seconds to fit that data set.

01:07.790 --> 01:10.960
Meanwhile we can continue with our code.

01:11.170 --> 01:16.610
We will define wiper a viable use in that part of the method on that decision tree.

01:17.650 --> 01:22.690
We will apply this to the next test buyable.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.730
We can do this to measure our performance.

01:25.760 --> 01:29.100
You know what test that this does.

01:29.260 --> 01:37.260
We will use the score Meffert that we think that will lead the X test and why test Bibles but we will

01:37.260 --> 01:39.930
also want to see our confusion matrix.

01:39.930 --> 01:41.970
This will not be enough.

01:42.180 --> 01:50.420
We just use the same code as before we will just copy and pasted and we will now get the prediction

01:50.420 --> 01:54.900
for the entire data set using the same method.

01:54.990 --> 01:59.180
We will get the expected why in abundance.

01:59.650 --> 02:03.400
And then we will create the confusion matrix with this information

02:07.980 --> 02:19.230
okay that's done we also need to validate our predictions just always and after this we can call our

02:19.230 --> 02:21.090
bloods Confucian matrix function

02:25.900 --> 02:26.420
right.

02:26.450 --> 02:27.630
It's almost done

02:30.460 --> 02:31.620
we will pass it.

02:31.740 --> 02:36.390
They can confuse my cheeks with just calculated on the expected class.

02:36.670 --> 02:43.060
It will just take a moment and we will be able to see the oversouls and it seems that we got really

02:43.070 --> 02:50.590
good results only 47 out of the almost five hundred further transactions were incorrectly label.
