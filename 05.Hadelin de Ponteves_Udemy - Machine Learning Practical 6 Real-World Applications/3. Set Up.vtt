WEBVTT

00:06.470 --> 00:07.960
We'll come back.

00:07.960 --> 00:13.930
Now we're going to prepare everything we need in our computer so we can do this exercise.

00:14.050 --> 00:21.400
Two of the main tools that we're going to be using are tons of flow uncourteous tons or flow will implement

00:21.460 --> 00:28.900
everything necessary so we can create and train our deep neural networks and girls will just make everything

00:28.930 --> 00:30.250
easier for us.

00:30.430 --> 00:37.830
So in just a few lines of code we will be able to create and train our neural network.

00:37.960 --> 00:42.880
You can download those and install them in your computer in case you haven't got that already.

00:42.880 --> 00:44.440
From this link.

00:45.700 --> 00:48.390
This is Stern's or Flo's web page.

00:48.440 --> 00:56.300
You can't just install a briefing from Kier you can install it in any operating system using the deep

00:56.390 --> 00:57.670
tools.

00:57.680 --> 00:59.800
This is also class what page.

00:59.930 --> 01:03.020
You can just install guide us from Chir.

01:03.020 --> 01:09.470
You can also use the tool to study this in any operating system that you might come.

01:09.890 --> 01:16.910
But remember that we're going to be using both machine learning and they belong in techniques many occasions

01:17.180 --> 01:18.160
those Tingley.

01:18.380 --> 01:20.250
We've just complemented each other.

01:20.450 --> 01:27.180
But in our case we will just be doing AB testing to see which mode performs best.

01:27.200 --> 01:34.470
So once we cover our double neural network we're going to just start over using machine learning.

01:34.780 --> 01:38.410
For that we're going to be using the sikat library.

01:38.570 --> 01:43.190
It is the most popular machine learning library and it is implemented in Python.

01:43.430 --> 01:46.700
You can download that from the website as well.

01:46.730 --> 01:54.320
You can just go to the installation part and use the tool once more to install it or use Anaconda in

01:54.320 --> 01:56.790
case you keep that installed as well.

01:58.230 --> 02:05.630
We're going to be using Jupiter notebooks to run our bite on code that God given in Amazon Web Services

02:05.650 --> 02:07.640
and Google Cloud platform.

02:07.720 --> 02:08.410
Sure.

02:08.520 --> 02:13.380
Or just your local machine in case you can got troubador already installed.

02:13.470 --> 02:20.640
You can go to our website you can go to the installation part and just press installing to be done notebook.

02:20.880 --> 02:26.690
There you will be able to see that you can install it once more using the tool.

02:26.700 --> 02:29.420
This is a really useful tool.

02:29.790 --> 02:35.950
You can see all of that in this you will remember that we're going to be using by some free works or

02:35.950 --> 02:40.160
Sysyphus not by done to at last.

02:40.160 --> 02:44.950
We're going to download our data set from this course resources.

02:44.980 --> 02:52.410
That's a real data set with credit card transactions that were anonymize be sure to cut that low that

02:52.450 --> 02:58.110
on a base level in whatever computer you'll use to run your code for our next beat.

02:58.110 --> 03:00.160
Yes that's it for now.

03:00.260 --> 03:02.300
On to you again in the next medievals.
