Hello.

00:01.590 --> 00:03.120
Welcome back everybody.

00:03.180 --> 00:08.430
In today's video we're going to begin with a data pre-processing part of this process and we're going

00:08.430 --> 00:10.020
to start with feature engineering.

00:10.020 --> 00:10.610
All right.

00:10.830 --> 00:13.110
So let's begin right away.

00:13.110 --> 00:16.580
First we of course import libraries in these new script again.

00:16.610 --> 00:23.170
Are there going to be Pandurs Empire which in this period we're not going to use the pipeline.

00:23.260 --> 00:26.840
SEABORNE libraries random in time.

00:26.850 --> 00:32.160
One more thing I'm going to do here is to set up a seat and you guys remember me from the previous studies

00:32.180 --> 00:32.640
there.

00:32.820 --> 00:38.400
I like to set up seeds before I do any kind of model here so I can replicate all the resource I'd done

00:38.400 --> 00:39.260
before.

00:39.660 --> 00:41.290
OK so we set up our seat.

00:41.400 --> 00:45.180
We read our data set against the financial data at CSB file.

00:45.180 --> 00:47.660
And let's begin with the engineering.

00:47.700 --> 00:53.450
So now the first step to do in the future engineering aspect is not going to be a really feature engineering.

00:53.460 --> 00:58.350
It's just going to be getting rid of the column that we found to be kind of faulty.

00:58.470 --> 01:04.050
And that was the months employee column we realized that for some reason the caller was congregating

01:04.050 --> 01:06.040
for the most part on the 0 value.

01:06.240 --> 01:11.340
So we're going to get rid of it because it's actually not an accurate representation of the data and

01:11.340 --> 01:14.040
we can move forward with a better model because of it.

01:14.430 --> 01:23.350
So we said that data file or that variable US itself minus the column that we are removing.

01:23.460 --> 01:28.420
And in this case is columns equal months employed.

01:29.040 --> 01:31.210
So we get rid of this.

01:31.290 --> 01:33.770
We run it and actually we got rid of that call.

01:33.810 --> 01:36.820
Now the next step is actually the real engineering.

01:37.080 --> 01:44.820
And to do that we have to remember that we have a column called personal account M that tells us how

01:44.820 --> 01:51.840
many months the person has had in their personal account and we have a similar call them personal accounts.

01:51.840 --> 01:58.320
Why that is how many years that person has had with that credit card that they have now this is a two

01:58.320 --> 02:00.020
part data set.

02:00.030 --> 02:05.700
So if a person has been in with that credit card for two years and two months or two years in three

02:05.700 --> 02:09.530
months then one column would say two years and they all call him say three months.

02:09.540 --> 02:10.180
OK.

02:10.470 --> 02:17.670
So in order to get a more centralized field that has to represents a time since greater account was

02:17.670 --> 02:18.510
created.

02:18.510 --> 02:24.600
We're going to combine these two columns and convert it into a Oberle month's column and how we're going

02:24.600 --> 02:24.930
to do that.

02:24.930 --> 02:26.450
Well let me show you.

02:27.230 --> 02:33.690
We first are going to decide what field to call this new column and it's going to be called just personnel

02:34.410 --> 02:37.130
count months.

02:38.040 --> 02:39.260
Okay that's all good.

02:39.540 --> 02:45.480
And this is going to be the result of the faultline is going to be the result of data set that personal

02:45.480 --> 02:56.870
account am plus the multiplication of the years times 12 because each year represents 12 months what

02:56.870 --> 03:02.800
we're going to do is we're going to multiply all of the years that a person has been in the count with.

03:02.900 --> 03:05.070
So personally I can't underscore why.

03:05.380 --> 03:08.340
And we're going to multiply by 12 that's going to give us how many months.

03:08.570 --> 03:13.760
All those years represent we add that to the Montse variable and we end up with the real set of months

03:14.150 --> 03:15.770
that we have had to look out for.

03:15.770 --> 03:16.460
OK.

03:16.490 --> 03:18.570
So we run this an excellent.

03:18.770 --> 03:19.570
It worked.

03:19.670 --> 03:24.830
And if we want to see how this looks let's take a quick look at those three fields that we just created.

03:25.160 --> 03:31.700
And let me actually copy this right here and it's going to make it easier for us to select.

03:31.700 --> 03:39.080
So the first is going to be the months the second field is going to be the year and their field is going

03:39.080 --> 03:43.200
to be that count that we created or the field that we created.

03:43.550 --> 03:46.210
So personal account months.

03:46.240 --> 03:47.520
Right.

03:48.560 --> 03:49.840
So we run this.

03:49.850 --> 03:55.760
I actually wish to run that with the head command so that we get the top W's and let's look at the results

03:55.760 --> 03:57.820
in the terminal.

03:57.830 --> 04:03.920
So here in the console we can see that for the first row the person has been with the account for two

04:03.920 --> 04:04.820
years and six months.

04:04.850 --> 04:05.560
Okay.

04:05.990 --> 04:10.820
That means that the person has been 24 months plus six which is 30 months.

04:10.820 --> 04:14.400
And this is exactly what we get on a personal or can month column.

04:14.450 --> 04:20.930
So we have that in these the convert into one to still represent how much time it has been since the

04:20.930 --> 04:22.100
personal with that count.

04:22.280 --> 04:27.460
And just to double check here and the second row we have seven years which is what eighty four months.

04:27.460 --> 04:32.760
But is 86 and is 86 months right here exactly what we expected it to be.

04:32.780 --> 04:34.250
So we have finalized our part.

04:34.250 --> 04:38.810
So before we finish all we have to do is get rid of the columns that we just utilize.

04:39.020 --> 04:45.070
So again we said the data set to itself minus the columns that we are remote.

04:45.890 --> 04:54.080
And in this case is the Mont. column that we originally had in the column and there should be it we

04:54.080 --> 04:54.860
run this.

04:54.860 --> 04:57.700
That gets removed and we're finalized with the feature engineering part.

04:58.040 --> 04:59.200
Thank you very much for watching.

04:59.200 --> 05:02.460
In the next video we're going to begin the one hiding coding aspect.

05:02.720 --> 05:07.850
And we're going to also get rid of the response variable from our dataset.

05:08.450 --> 05:10.880
Thank you for watching and see you in the next period.
