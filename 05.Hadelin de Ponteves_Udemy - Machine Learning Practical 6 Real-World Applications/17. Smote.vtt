00:00.300 --> 00:05.390
You might get the idea that something solution hard to train is not the best way to go.

00:05.430 --> 00:07.640
It seems counter intuitive.

00:07.890 --> 00:16.100
So what we're going to do is to apply some Oberth sampling techniques such as smoked.

00:16.170 --> 00:19.700
Will start with verify that we cut that ready.

00:19.860 --> 00:24.100
We can do that from the command line just from Jupiter.

00:24.480 --> 00:26.820
And we'll also import the library

00:35.330 --> 00:36.520
next week.

00:36.620 --> 00:39.530
Our X Y biofilms you see small

00:44.250 --> 00:52.540
we will use some whole mess but I'll give it us in put the x y that we already have.

00:52.570 --> 00:55.750
We just need to change from white to up.

00:55.820 --> 01:01.860
It will transform the output function to pondus.

01:01.900 --> 01:03.320
Lots of things.

01:03.380 --> 01:05.470
That is what we would need for later

01:16.370 --> 01:24.650
next we will apply the same chain just split function to split ours into train and test data it's

01:35.720 --> 01:36.340
next.

01:36.380 --> 01:44.960
We will retrain our model with then you will just copy that code before starting by transforming everything

01:44.990 --> 01:46.310
into not by a race

01:50.790 --> 01:54.480
then where we eat the National Park training in our multiple

02:04.490 --> 02:06.830
We will also Gobbi decode for blood.

02:06.830 --> 02:10.170
In the confusion matrix same must before and now.

02:10.220 --> 02:14.260
Notice how the chenge part is a lot slower.

02:14.510 --> 02:19.870
That's because we oversample our data set and we cover a lot more training that

02:25.060 --> 02:30.520
first official my tricks for our test than for the entire

02:39.880 --> 02:43.350
We were just lost soul destroying parks.

02:43.540 --> 02:44.880
But Julie copy this

03:05.930 --> 03:08.270
now just call the number on satchels.

03:08.280 --> 03:16.000
The first parts cost a lot but we only have six Sutherlands sanctions Lingala us for alderman's.

03:16.000 --> 03:25.060
Also notice how we cover absolutely no fraudulent suctions label us none Trudell and entire.

03:25.490 --> 03:28.400
We don't deal with sampling affects.

03:28.620 --> 03:36.060
We also shop only 1000 transactions that none fraudulent transactions that were labeled as fraudulent.

03:36.060 --> 03:38.010
This means we have almost none.

03:38.040 --> 03:43.410
False positives which reduces the amount of work of our fraud department.
