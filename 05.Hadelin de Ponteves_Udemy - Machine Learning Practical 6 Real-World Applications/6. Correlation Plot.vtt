00:01.110 --> 00:01.980
Hello everybody.

00:01.980 --> 00:03.090
Welcome back.

00:03.170 --> 00:09.650
They were going to see a lot to gauge the correlation of the independent variables with what was foursquare.

00:10.260 --> 00:16.340
There is only one these so that we can get a sense oh what CEOs are going to be a stronger party there

00:16.340 --> 00:19.240
is when they will get you know our model.

00:19.260 --> 00:25.170
Now this is not the exact correlation that the models are going to have but it is a very good educational

00:25.170 --> 00:29.660
step to get familiar which fields may actually impact the model.

00:30.450 --> 00:33.970
So let's run the code first.

00:34.110 --> 00:41.370
We're going to grade the correlation but which is going to come from a dataset that has all the fields

00:42.540 --> 00:48.110
because this correlation requires two independent fields that we're using to be in.

00:48.300 --> 00:54.150
So we're going to remove the categorical variables and we're going to keep the binary variables in any

00:54.240 --> 00:55.870
of my or.

00:56.050 --> 00:57.860
So let's begin with the block.

00:58.180 --> 01:01.830
First we need to create the sense that we're going to be.

01:02.140 --> 01:08.430
And this is just the original way to say minus a couple columns and the scores are of course the response

01:08.430 --> 01:20.260
variable which is charged to this and then the user identifier which we don't need as well.

01:20.340 --> 01:27.730
We're also going to get rid of the category variables which are housing payments.

01:29.550 --> 01:35.540
And finally the sign which is just Soliah or sign.

01:35.820 --> 01:40.100
So we have our chosen they sit here and you just set up a new line.

01:40.100 --> 01:45.550
This is a three and we're going to continue plodding within the same line.

01:45.750 --> 01:53.790
So luckily for us this particular Pandurs the hostile or wing functions which grew 8 8 correlational

01:53.850 --> 01:59.310
each of the columns with the argument this function and the argument to this function is going to be

01:59.660 --> 02:06.630
to say that churn the response so that we create a correlation matrix of all the independent columns.

02:06.660 --> 02:08.370
That response.

02:08.910 --> 02:10.030
The next thing is the blah.

02:10.030 --> 02:16.150
So again we use the internal functions of lab in bar which uses a BB Block.

02:16.950 --> 02:20.790
And this is going to finish the entire planning process.

02:20.790 --> 02:25.640
We just want a couple more arguments to the bar but so that is good to see.

02:25.650 --> 02:27.430
So let's give those arguments.

02:27.540 --> 02:31.290
The first one is going to be precise and simple to your size.

02:31.380 --> 02:33.180
This depends on your screen.

02:33.180 --> 02:37.630
My screen is much better with a figure such as 25:10.

02:38.250 --> 02:39.030
Great.

02:39.030 --> 02:44.630
The next step is to get the actual font size and the title.

02:44.970 --> 02:53.820
So the title is going to be the simple correlation with the responsible title so that we can tell anybody

02:53.820 --> 02:54.290
it seems.

02:54.290 --> 03:02.010
But what exactly we're showing that this is great.

03:02.250 --> 03:08.970
And then of course they say the font size font size is just going to be 20 in my case.

03:09.180 --> 03:12.500
Well actually 15:15 it is better for this.

03:12.510 --> 03:17.610
And again you guys can play with these values to make sure it matches your screen better then we're

03:17.610 --> 03:18.830
going to get a rotation.

03:18.830 --> 03:24.870
Are you 45 degrees so that we don't turn our head to the right through read the X games this way.

03:24.870 --> 03:28.920
The claim was I wrote it in a little bit and we can see just fine straight.

03:29.430 --> 03:31.350
And finally this is just my preference.

03:31.350 --> 03:32.180
I'm going to say.

03:32.420 --> 03:32.930
True.

03:33.050 --> 03:40.830
So it makes it very clear that it was so say this entire process of building these correllation plot

03:41.630 --> 03:45.700
holes shows action.

03:46.140 --> 03:48.520
So it's going to be slow.

03:48.750 --> 03:51.090
There's a few columns here that we could analyze.

03:51.090 --> 03:57.250
So let's begin with the first h h these Mubarak you know on the very left side.

03:57.390 --> 03:58.970
And what does this tell us.

03:59.250 --> 04:06.240
This player is telling us that H is negatively correlated to the response variable.

04:06.800 --> 04:15.690
AK The smaller the H it is the most likely for the response variable to be won.

04:16.080 --> 04:19.040
So the younger you are the most likely for you.

04:19.390 --> 04:20.070
OK.

04:20.440 --> 04:21.290
OK.

04:21.870 --> 04:27.780
The same we see for that posses we drolls in purchases which are the next three Revox smaller amount

04:27.780 --> 04:28.820
of deposits.

04:28.980 --> 04:32.840
The most likely churn is more among that he draws in purses.

04:32.940 --> 04:39.840
This makes a lot of sense because this means that the less activity you have the more slack you're going

04:39.840 --> 04:46.030
to turn the single price for partner is of course not the next one is take.

04:46.320 --> 04:48.710
And this one is a little bit more weird.

04:48.820 --> 04:55.220
This is telling us that if you think credit or with us you're going to be more likely to hurt.

04:55.260 --> 05:00.750
So maybe this is giving us some insights into the fact that people are not very happy with the credit

05:00.750 --> 05:03.370
card feature that we have with the Kraker product.

05:03.510 --> 05:08.550
So this could be interesting to explore further if we want to see your out while discussing our users

05:08.690 --> 05:10.110
believe that.

05:10.980 --> 05:16.620
Now since you recommend this means the least amount of recommendations you have the more likely you

05:16.620 --> 05:18.010
are to churn.

05:18.690 --> 05:24.110
So if I give you more and more recommendations you're going to be less likely.

05:24.670 --> 05:25.170
OK.

05:25.560 --> 05:30.470
So we just want to get those recommendations up so that people are a it.

05:30.910 --> 05:35.690
Now this is like and like these surprisingly seem to be both possibly correlated.

05:35.880 --> 05:38.000
So it's still a..

05:38.080 --> 05:42.390
And the size of the bar is really small so the correlations that strong so this conclusion might not

05:42.470 --> 05:46.170
help but it's still there just a little bit if you like.

05:46.260 --> 05:50.010
Or is that any of the props that we have in your wallet.

05:50.100 --> 05:50.970
Sure.

05:51.500 --> 05:53.100
OK good.

05:53.130 --> 05:54.010
Moving forward.

05:54.150 --> 06:00.600
So the obligation being meaning that the less applications you are getting the more likely.

06:00.630 --> 06:01.090
Sure.

06:01.110 --> 06:08.070
And the opposite meaning that the issues that you see in the more likely you are to say OK.

06:08.310 --> 06:14.970
That makes a lot of sense now I don't know if you have downloaded the app then you're most likely to

06:14.970 --> 06:16.400
stay with this a.

06:16.490 --> 06:21.570
You have not done though you want to keep going along.

06:21.570 --> 06:25.110
We see that the strength of the box goes down a little bit.

06:25.110 --> 06:28.370
There are not as important as some of these other fields.

06:29.430 --> 06:37.290
We see that where user and a web app user and both iOS users well are correlating with MS phosphate

06:37.300 --> 06:46.080
meaning that if you're web user and a web user or an Iowa as you say you're more likely to turn it your

06:46.080 --> 06:50.180
natural user you actually want it to say OK.

06:50.310 --> 06:51.480
Interesting.

06:52.290 --> 06:55.960
If you have registered more phones you are more likely to learn.

06:56.490 --> 07:02.340
And if you are waiting for a loan at this point you're more likely to say hey we can make assumptions

07:02.340 --> 07:03.810
on why this may be.

07:03.810 --> 07:06.720
But remember the strength of the illusion is very small.

07:06.720 --> 07:12.400
If you see here on the y axis it's only around points or 5 which is only 5 percent.

07:12.660 --> 07:15.100
So these correlations Even though are nice to see.

07:15.100 --> 07:21.530
They're not that strong but it can give us some educational insights on what really is a variable and

07:21.530 --> 07:23.930
in which way is more important.

07:24.450 --> 07:32.160
We have cancell long receipt loan reject alone for two months plus for one month of them be positively

07:32.160 --> 07:37.600
correlated meaning that if somebody performs that action they are more likely to.

07:38.060 --> 07:38.640
OK.

07:38.880 --> 07:45.570
And finally is it still correlated which could make me a little bit of sense meaning that if you have

07:45.750 --> 07:48.780
been referred by somebody you are less likely to check.

07:49.320 --> 07:49.910
OK.

07:50.100 --> 07:53.620
So this is a good insight on what may be good for our model.

07:53.670 --> 07:59.940
We see the obviously the financial activity is very important but it does also have some kind of impact

08:00.060 --> 08:02.020
on the response there.

08:02.100 --> 08:07.500
So moving forward we're going to continue with a few more additional blocks specifically the coalition

08:07.500 --> 08:08.190
meetings.

08:08.220 --> 08:10.240
So that's what we're analyzing the next week.

08:10.560 --> 08:13.990
Thank you guys very much for watching and see you next hour.
