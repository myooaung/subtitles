00:00.330 --> 00:05.450
Welcome everybody in this video we're going to take a quick look at the data where we got it from.

00:05.450 --> 00:09.930
How is it structure and how it looks in the SB file.

00:09.990 --> 00:17.120
So let's jump into it because our applications are coming through lending marketplaces that we discussed

00:17.120 --> 00:18.530
in the previous video.

00:18.660 --> 00:24.420
Then we have access to the financial data before the onboarding process even begins.

00:24.420 --> 00:30.530
This data includes personal information age time employed and other financial metrics.

00:30.540 --> 00:35.880
These are the financial metrics are often just a huge list of different features.

00:36.330 --> 00:43.170
And although in this project we're not going to be using those features we are going to be using rescored

00:43.200 --> 00:46.130
that were created based on those features.

00:46.380 --> 00:48.680
So let me give you a description.

00:48.930 --> 00:52.890
We're going to get a lot of financial data from the P2P marketplace.

00:53.440 --> 01:00.360
The data comes in that data comes in even before we decide to accept the lead and give our love an offer

01:00.360 --> 01:01.620
in the marketplace itself.

01:01.770 --> 01:06.990
Again this is before the user arrives into our on boarding process.

01:06.990 --> 01:14.970
Now our engineers in our finest team will work together on building racecourse from these financial

01:14.970 --> 01:20.210
metrics and it will be a couple of different rescore space on many different factors.

01:20.280 --> 01:25.110
It is not our job to decide what the risk scores are what they mean or how they are built.

01:25.110 --> 01:30.480
Those are more in the finance compliance and engineering teams but we're going to leverage those scores.

01:30.600 --> 01:36.210
So the data that we're going to end up with in the one that we're going to build all of our models based

01:36.210 --> 01:42.630
on is based on few financial metrics like I mentioned I said of course coming from our own engineering

01:42.630 --> 01:50.490
finance teams and also we're going to get a couple of quality scores that come from the P2P marketplace

01:50.490 --> 01:51.570
itself.

01:51.630 --> 01:57.000
So the market is going to provide us with a definition of quality scores whatever whatever they decide

01:57.000 --> 02:01.490
to score a particular lead and we're going to use that in our models.

02:01.620 --> 02:07.410
Now with all these data we're going to finally be able to build a model that can predict whether or

02:07.410 --> 02:13.910
not the user is of a quality such that can reach that particular end in screen that we want.

02:14.250 --> 02:15.750
The esign in screen.

02:16.170 --> 02:19.110
So now just take a quick look at the actual data.

02:19.130 --> 02:19.840
All right.

02:20.400 --> 02:27.780
So if we move the data around here let's zoom in a little bit here and give you a quick description

02:27.780 --> 02:29.090
of what we're seeing.

02:29.190 --> 02:37.190
So the first of course is always going to be the user identifier column and this is something I always

02:37.190 --> 02:42.350
see it the way I always square things is the first column or my data is that user identifier does in

02:42.350 --> 02:46.870
this case is a random number that is I believe 7 digits long.

02:47.120 --> 02:51.410
And it's again it's random for every single person.

02:51.560 --> 02:53.220
And we don't care much about it.

02:53.300 --> 02:55.970
Now the second column is the age column the age column.

02:55.970 --> 03:03.200
Again since most locked up begins in all of applicants have to be 18 or older to qualify.

03:03.290 --> 03:09.110
Then the age group here is going to be 18 to as high as 180 depending on how old the person the last

03:09.110 --> 03:10.180
applicant is.

03:10.190 --> 03:17.690
So based get your base get you is an indicator of how often the applicant gets paid weekly meaning every

03:17.690 --> 03:20.210
week of course by weekly every two weeks.

03:20.210 --> 03:23.570
Semi-monthly been a little bit different meaning twice a month.

03:23.750 --> 03:26.890
So it's not exactly every two weeks but it's almost there.

03:27.080 --> 03:31.010
And montri finally bean of course just once a month.

03:31.460 --> 03:36.570
Now the next column is homeowner and this has only two levels.

03:36.580 --> 03:43.700
One in zero if it's labeled as one then the user is a homeowner he's appropriate.

03:43.890 --> 03:48.320
He's the owner of the house and if it's serious I think he's probably renting the house or has some

03:48.380 --> 03:50.980
other accommodation income.

03:50.990 --> 03:53.720
Again this is the monthly income of the applicant.

03:53.750 --> 03:59.250
So this is the sum of all the paychecks they got in that particular month.

03:59.570 --> 04:02.730
And this is an estimate that comes from the P2P marketplace as well.

04:02.900 --> 04:09.200
Or this could be also a calculation based on the features that the user gave us at the beginning of

04:09.200 --> 04:12.700
the application process again in the marketplace.

04:12.770 --> 04:13.890
Now the next columns.

04:13.910 --> 04:16.020
Let me stretch it out for you a little bit.

04:17.330 --> 04:23.540
Is years employed which is a number indicating how many years the person has worked in their current

04:23.540 --> 04:30.050
job the other column is a current address year meaning that how many years the person has stay in their

04:30.050 --> 04:31.690
current age or address.

04:31.760 --> 04:36.260
So have they really been in the house or an apartment for a long period of time or not.

04:36.590 --> 04:38.830
And this column is personal account.

04:39.620 --> 04:44.650
And this means that how many months that person has had their personal account.

04:45.060 --> 04:50.410
Now these two columns right here are a combination of them.

04:50.420 --> 04:55.490
So you have personal account Y which is years and personal account which is months.

04:55.520 --> 04:55.930
OK.

04:56.120 --> 05:01.580
So the combination of these two columns means that this particular user the first user in this dataset

05:01.940 --> 05:05.890
has had their account for two years and six months.

05:06.210 --> 05:06.740
OK.

05:07.040 --> 05:12.540
So this is something that we're going to play around a little bit more during the process moving forward.

05:13.100 --> 05:22.670
Then we have the highest that call and this indicates whether or not the person has had any debt or

05:22.670 --> 05:29.170
any positive balance meaning that they owe money in the credit account or whether or not they are clean.

05:29.660 --> 05:35.450
So this relates of course to these two columns in the past these two columns are our latest credit account

05:35.870 --> 05:37.330
credit card things like that.

05:37.490 --> 05:39.530
And this is if the person has that.

05:39.740 --> 05:46.250
Now if we expand a little bit more to the right we see we're going to see a little more so first the

05:46.250 --> 05:52.340
amount requested is here the amount requested is what the user decided to apply for the loan applicant

05:53.170 --> 06:00.620
the rescore is the beginning of the set of five scores that are given to us by our finance and engineering

06:00.620 --> 06:01.830
teams.

06:02.300 --> 06:12.700
And the first risk seems to be a rescore a big number probably from Arnav a couple thousand to 100000.

06:13.070 --> 06:21.800
And this rescore evaluate whether or not the user is likely to pay the loan is likely to sign the loan

06:22.100 --> 06:23.150
and things of that sort.

06:23.150 --> 06:26.840
So these risks are now built to predict the onboarding process.

06:26.970 --> 06:32.990
They are built to predict whether or not the U.S. is going to fulfill the actual application a received

06:32.990 --> 06:37.940
loan or set the loan and whether or not they're going to pay the loan although it is not exactly related

06:37.940 --> 06:39.580
about our response.

06:39.860 --> 06:43.910
This is something that we can still leverage because there still has to be some kind of relationship

06:44.230 --> 06:50.240
within its risk course and the likelihood of reaching that is sign in screen.

06:50.240 --> 06:55.400
So we have this we have the rescore number two which seems to be a number from 0 to 1 the same from

06:55.400 --> 06:58.350
reactor number three four and five and these are different.

06:58.350 --> 07:04.640
So you can see one for example in this first row rescore number 551 is pointing to this one point forty

07:04.640 --> 07:07.400
eight point ninety and point 73.

07:07.550 --> 07:12.040
So its a very different risk course meaning that they are based on different factors.

07:12.050 --> 07:18.490
Now finally we have the two scores that are coming from the P2P marketplace.

07:18.530 --> 07:23.350
So we have the quad rescore external quad core and external quad core number two.

07:24.080 --> 07:29.760
And again the argument from Ballis from 0 to 1 and they are different scores.

07:29.760 --> 07:35.570
You can see now the last two columns are the increase in the last month so homine inquiries that user

07:35.570 --> 07:41.840
has had in the last month and this just a number based on how many times the user has had a hard check

07:41.840 --> 07:42.810
on their credit score.

07:42.890 --> 07:45.080
Also known as a hard pool.

07:45.160 --> 07:49.560
And finally we have the e-zine column which is our response variable.

07:49.570 --> 07:55.960
So one indicates that the person has completed the signing process and 0 means that the person has not

07:55.960 --> 07:58.480
completed the e-zines process.

07:58.510 --> 07:58.910
OK.

07:59.050 --> 08:04.780
So this is how they restructure will go and explore a little bit more when we get into the coding section

08:05.230 --> 08:06.420
of this project.

08:06.430 --> 08:09.920
So thank you very much for watching and see you in the next video.
