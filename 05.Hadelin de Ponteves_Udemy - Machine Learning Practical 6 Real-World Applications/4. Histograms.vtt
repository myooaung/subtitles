00:01.300 --> 00:08.370
Will come back everybody in this video we're going to begin plugging our data set in histograms to see

00:08.550 --> 00:13.730
how they're distributed and to see if there is any particular pattern that seems interesting to us.

00:13.800 --> 00:18.700
This is going to be again like any other of the other videos for educational purposes we should always

00:18.700 --> 00:20.680
be familiar with Howard Dean and looks.

00:20.880 --> 00:28.020
Luckily for everybody who likes building models in this particular case study the FDA process is going

00:28.020 --> 00:29.310
to be a little bit shorter.

00:29.310 --> 00:33.850
We're going to of course do the correlation blood the histograms and the correlation matrix.

00:34.020 --> 00:34.950
But it's going to be it.

00:35.370 --> 00:38.570
And then we're going to jump into the model immediately.

00:38.670 --> 00:41.680
So let's begin with this part the histograms.

00:41.730 --> 00:48.360
Now before we can do anything about plugging histograms we need to make sure that the columns that we

00:48.750 --> 00:55.520
offer to the histogram is actually plausible meaning that we don't care about categorical variables

00:55.570 --> 00:58.450
those have to be removed and any barabar with.

00:58.460 --> 00:59.870
And they have to be removed.

01:00.030 --> 01:03.590
Now in the previous bill we saw that there were no columns that had any.

01:03.600 --> 01:05.120
So that's a positive.

01:05.130 --> 01:09.900
So the only things left to drop out of are temporary data that we're going to give to the histogram

01:10.260 --> 01:17.520
is going to be the user variable the user identifier which we don't care about at all.

01:17.520 --> 01:24.930
The response barabar which is a sign underscore sign and the one categorical variable that we have on

01:24.930 --> 01:27.690
our dataset which is the pay schedule.

01:27.840 --> 01:29.580
So let's do that.

01:29.580 --> 01:36.210
We begin with creating a new data set that is going to have all the data columns that we actually care

01:36.670 --> 01:38.250
plugging into histograms.

01:38.430 --> 01:45.820
So we're going to drop the comp that we want with service calls and we get the names that we know.

01:46.050 --> 01:53.960
So the user identifier is labeled as and ready as we so the categorical variable is co-pays Kitchell.

01:54.150 --> 01:55.680
So that one goes out.

01:55.770 --> 02:00.270
And finally the response variable is esign good.

02:00.330 --> 02:02.160
So we run this and it works.

02:02.160 --> 02:06.570
So we have our new dataset you can see that on the wearable Explorer 2 that we have and you did us in

02:06.570 --> 02:08.750
with three less columns.

02:09.210 --> 02:11.910
So now let's plot our actual histogram.

02:11.910 --> 02:17.910
Now we're going to leverage the fact that we have done this exact same image of multiple histograms

02:17.940 --> 02:19.240
in the previous case studies.

02:19.320 --> 02:25.600
So we're going to copy the code that we learn how to do in those videos with small little changes.

02:25.650 --> 02:30.100
Now let's run over the score really quickly so you understand what's happening.

02:30.600 --> 02:33.500
The first line of the code is you in the figure size.

02:33.540 --> 02:35.600
This is the perfect figure size for my screen.

02:35.650 --> 02:41.460
I personally have a forking screen here but depending on your resolution and your screen size you may

02:41.460 --> 02:47.000
be able to play with this to fit your screen better then the next line is the title of the columns.

02:47.010 --> 02:51.360
So of the entire image which is histograms on the medical columns that's fine.

02:51.390 --> 02:53.750
We give it a font size stuff it's on your screen.

02:54.060 --> 03:01.320
And now we loop that for each of the columns we're going to create a new subplot game we're going to

03:01.320 --> 03:07.650
plot it and we're going to set the title of that plot to the particular column that that plot is representing

03:08.130 --> 03:11.520
all of the story for we're really done before and that is new here.

03:11.560 --> 03:17.700
Now I read these two lines right here because I realize that for the numbers that we're having in the

03:17.700 --> 03:24.450
the features that we're having and also any future move forward this is a good safe guard to make sure

03:24.450 --> 03:27.800
that our plots are not taken too long to display.

03:28.080 --> 03:33.120
So let me explain this in the previous videos and which we did histograms.

03:33.120 --> 03:40.310
We created the bowels parable the bus parable pretty much is a is all of the unique values here.

03:40.530 --> 03:42.670
In your column that you're trying to put.

03:43.020 --> 03:43.490
OK.

03:43.620 --> 03:50.030
So if you have a hundred years in your column then the histogram is going to support up to 100 little

03:50.040 --> 03:50.620
ticks.

03:50.730 --> 03:59.700
OK so all that makes sense now if you have a lot of lot of different numbers a big range especially

03:59.700 --> 04:02.490
for continuous variables like the rescore.

04:03.120 --> 04:07.290
So those can take a very unique value for all of the users.

04:07.530 --> 04:13.380
So in those cases you're going to end up having like dozens and dozens of different possible values

04:13.390 --> 04:21.300
here in balls and appealed to his look function is going to struggle to pretty much create a bane for

04:21.390 --> 04:22.850
all of those possible Balis.

04:22.920 --> 04:23.470
OK.

04:23.670 --> 04:28.410
And although it is going to war is going to take a long time to plot and it may even crash your system

04:28.410 --> 04:30.430
depending on how powerful your system is.

04:30.690 --> 04:34.780
So that is why I created this extra variable here called the boss parable.

04:34.990 --> 04:39.130
Well it disarrayed that the boss Birbal But this is a limit on the boss variable.

04:39.150 --> 04:45.000
So what it does is that if there is more than a hundred unique values for example in the rescore column

04:45.420 --> 04:48.570
then the number of bins are going to default to 100.

04:48.570 --> 04:54.390
That way we make sure that no histogram that is played in this big image is going to have more than

04:54.390 --> 05:00.990
one hundred bins per histogram and that is not going to struggle to plot all of these values.

05:00.990 --> 05:01.650
Okay.

05:02.030 --> 05:02.850
And that's about it.

05:02.850 --> 05:08.980
This is the only change I added to the previous histogram code that we have seen before.

05:09.030 --> 05:12.900
I also have indexed it a little bit differently but that's something that you will want to see if you're

05:12.900 --> 05:14.280
just take a look at the code.

05:14.580 --> 05:17.310
So finally we plot a histogram we can get a color.

05:17.400 --> 05:20.610
We set up a rectangle so that not the overlaps.

05:20.610 --> 05:26.190
Again this is another barabar that you can play around with to fit are screen better and let's run in

05:26.310 --> 05:27.180
and see what we get.

05:35.350 --> 05:36.380
Awesome.

05:36.550 --> 05:39.710
So we have our image of histograms here.

05:40.000 --> 05:40.750
Excellent.

05:40.750 --> 05:43.200
So now let's take a look at this histograms right here.

05:43.240 --> 05:47.320
We have the HD surround which is for the most part we really distribute it.

05:47.560 --> 05:50.560
The other histogram here we see is home owner.

05:50.770 --> 05:56.810
And since this is a binary variable we only have two bars 0 or 1 0 on the left one on the right and

05:56.810 --> 05:59.030
they are somewhat evenly distributed.

05:59.110 --> 06:01.610
So that's not the interest in there.

06:01.780 --> 06:07.180
The income while the income even though there is ups and downs there's like little built in look at

06:07.180 --> 06:08.050
things here.

06:08.050 --> 06:13.720
If we draw a line on top of these types of every of the bars are here we're going to see in kind of

06:13.720 --> 06:17.440
normal distribution that is right skewed.

06:18.130 --> 06:18.710
Okay.

06:18.850 --> 06:26.980
So the income for the most part is like average as in this two to four 4000 range but he has a long

06:26.980 --> 06:30.920
ride tail that can go up to 10000 now.

06:31.290 --> 06:33.320
So here we see months employed.

06:33.700 --> 06:37.510
This is very good and there's a reason why is this column is here.

06:37.570 --> 06:46.630
You're going to see that most of the users play on the Surak particular value and very few everywhere

06:46.720 --> 06:47.130
else.

06:47.140 --> 06:48.070
Okay.

06:48.730 --> 06:57.940
And this is where we're because they shouldn't be the case that so many people have even years of employment.

06:57.940 --> 07:03.700
Meaning that because employment is distributed by years and months and years could be two three and

07:03.700 --> 07:06.010
four and months could be again.

07:06.030 --> 07:07.060
10:59 right.

07:07.240 --> 07:15.430
So it is weird to see that a lot of users have one year exactly and they're months like exactly zero.

07:15.430 --> 07:19.890
So they have one year working at their job flat and or maybe they have two years.

07:19.900 --> 07:22.590
Again most of them ending with the Montsoreau.

07:22.710 --> 07:27.640
So they have a flat two years flat three years flat four years this doesn't seem right.

07:27.640 --> 07:28.150
OK.

07:28.330 --> 07:36.190
Because today's We can assume that the data set here in months employees is not quite accurate.

07:36.250 --> 07:38.170
So this is something good to see.

07:38.170 --> 07:40.650
So we're going to work with this in a bit.

07:40.990 --> 07:45.740
But the reason for this history is to spot things like this that really don't make any sense.

07:45.920 --> 07:46.360
OK.

07:46.600 --> 07:50.250
So your employee seems to be very noble to distribute it with the right as well.

07:50.290 --> 07:51.610
So nothing new here.

07:51.610 --> 07:57.180
The same applies for current address year personal account month and person account here.

07:57.260 --> 08:05.620
Now what also has kind no right skewed but its peak seems to be much short lived and then everything

08:05.620 --> 08:07.010
else skews to the right.

08:07.210 --> 08:09.990
But there's nothing crazy about this.

08:10.000 --> 08:15.890
Now if we move a little bit more to the right we have has that which is most of the people have debt

08:15.970 --> 08:17.380
as compared to those who do not.

08:17.480 --> 08:23.530
As we saw in the described method before we see a mother requested so most of the people request from

08:23.530 --> 08:29.560
like perhaps like 400 or 300 all the way to one thousand to fifteen hundred for the most part.

08:29.710 --> 08:32.780
And then we have a small pool of people who are requesting a lot more.

08:32.980 --> 08:40.780
Now if we look at the risk scores this are built professionally by again financial engineering teams

08:40.780 --> 08:41.820
and things of the sort.

08:42.130 --> 08:48.040
So we pay the distributions for this course to be very stable.

08:48.040 --> 08:55.840
And here we see that distribution is pretty normal looking the same for risk core 2 3 4 5 and even the

08:55.870 --> 08:59.240
external quality scores are normally distributed for the most part.

08:59.410 --> 09:02.250
Rescored 3 looks a little bit like we're.

09:02.590 --> 09:09.220
But if you again draw a line on this sparse and you traced all the lines going on top of all the bars

09:09.550 --> 09:11.890
you're going to see this going to look normal ish.

09:12.040 --> 09:12.580
Okay.

09:12.970 --> 09:21.430
So the final one that we have to explore here are the inquiries the inquiries are spiked up at the beginning

09:21.490 --> 09:22.590
and then they have a right.

09:22.600 --> 09:25.880
Well like most of the plots that we have seen which makes sense Okay.

09:26.020 --> 09:32.200
So you may have some 0 or 1 or 2 increase in the last month because you are trying to get a loan you're

09:32.200 --> 09:36.450
testing different providers to see which ones can give you the best loan.

09:36.760 --> 09:44.980
But if you have had a lot lot a lot more than you're going to be in the minority and that's because

09:44.980 --> 09:48.810
nobody wants so many Harpo's on their credit so they're going to be careful not to do that.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.620
But some people don't know better so they may just do it.

09:51.620 --> 09:55.870
Trying try and end up with a lot of inquiries anyway.

09:56.080 --> 09:57.780
So this is a good visualization.

09:57.820 --> 10:02.690
We're going to take what we learn from these histogram and move into the next steps.

10:02.740 --> 10:03.360
OK.

10:03.640 --> 10:05.920
So thank you very much for watching this video.

10:05.920 --> 10:07.830
See you guys on the next one.
