00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:03.600
[Autogenerated] So we've deployed the AB really easily,

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.170
thanks to the option that the AWS Toolkit added to the project's context menu.

3
00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:11.390
And because we're using elastic beanstalk,

4
00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:15.580
we didn't have to make a lot of difficult decisions in this case.

5
00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.550
Some of the key decisions were making sure we chose an

6
00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.110
instance type that's covered by the free tier.

7
00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:24.280
So we chose T to Micro and also because this

8
00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.200
application is accessing an RDS database.

9
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.710
We had to be sure to choose the security group for the RDS

10
00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.200
database when we're doing the configuration.

11
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.170
So we've got the tiny temporary hack in place that we have to deal with,

12
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.890
which is getting the secrets onto AWS and making sure the

13
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.670
application knows where to look for them.

14
00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.240
That's what we'll tackle in the next Majal.

15
00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:47.610
I hope you're having fun,

16
00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.340
even though I just intentionally ReNu into a tiny little wall.

17
00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.860
Here's some relevant resource is and links that I've mentioned in this module.

18
00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:05.000
I'm Julie Lierman and thanks again for watching fundamentals of building dot net applications on AWS
