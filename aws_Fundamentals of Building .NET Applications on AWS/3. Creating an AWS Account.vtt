00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.360
[Autogenerated] So now it's time to create an AWS account,

2
00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:08.600
and you can do that right from that free tier page.

3
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.490
There's a link to create a free account,

4
00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:12.780
and it'll have you walk through a series of short

5
00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.090
forms to collect your email address, create account name.

6
00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.150
Choose an account type, which in this case would be personal.

7
00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.740
Provide your contact info and, of course, that payment information.

8
00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:29.140
The payment information gets verified with $1 or one euro charged to your card,

9
00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.050
and then that's removed after you verified it,

10
00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:34.030
so it won't really cost you anything.

11
00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.730
You'll also need to verify your identity by way of a text message or an email.

12
00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.630
The last decision is to choose a support plan,

13
00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.810
and here you would choose basic, which is free.

14
00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:46.050
That's the last step,

15
00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.480
and then the next thing you'll see is a welcome to Amazon Web services.

16
00:00:50.480 --> 00:01:01.000
It should only take a few minutes for your account to be ready to use. Now we're ready to head over to Visual studio to continue working with AWS
