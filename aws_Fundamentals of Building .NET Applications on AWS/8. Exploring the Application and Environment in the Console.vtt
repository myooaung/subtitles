00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:03.060
[Autogenerated] one last thing I want to do is give you a

2
00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.640
quick look at the application and environment in the AWS

3
00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.980
management console at the services list.

4
00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.680
Elastic Beanstalk is one of my short cuts because I was recently using it.

5
00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:15.800
And once I click on it,

6
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.800
we see a list of all of the elastic Beanstalk environments.

7
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.640
Well, I only have the one anyway on the left.

8
00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.260
You can choose to view the environment list or the

9
00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.610
application list in the environment list when I click on

10
00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.540
the hyperlinked environment name.

11
00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:31.770
Net core FBI dash deaf.

12
00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:35.300
There's a quick overview, and it shows the status is healthy.

13
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.560
You can upload and deploy from here if you want,

14
00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.770
and the actions dropped down lets you manage the environments

15
00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.820
configuration or stop and start the environment,

16
00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.830
which stops and starts the application.

17
00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:49.200
Because the environment is essentially the applications server,

18
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.040
there are a lot more management tasks you can perform on the environment,

19
00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.630
and they're listed over in the menu on the left.

20
00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.520
Let's go look at the application list now.

21
00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:58.150
So again,

22
00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.880
I only have one application in the list and there's

23
00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.820
really not a lot going on here.

24
00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.000
It tells you the environment,

25
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.580
name and the URL and the actions let you do little things

26
00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.040
like manage the tags for the application.

27
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.320
Create another environment because, remember,

28
00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:22.000
you can run your application on multiple environments at the same time, and you can also swap Urals between the different environments if you need to.
