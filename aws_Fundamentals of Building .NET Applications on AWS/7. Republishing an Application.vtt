00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:04.010
[Autogenerated] But first I'll have to republish the application,

2
00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:07.140
and that's something else I wanted you to see anyway.

3
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.020
But this time, instead of the option to create a new application environment,

4
00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:15.630
I'll choose to redeploy to an existing environment

5
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.570
and all select the Net Corey P.

6
00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.660
I.

7
00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.980
Dev.

8
00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.960
Environment from the list of existing environments and

9
00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.040
then click next to go to the next page.

10
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.890
These options are being read from the Jason file that the

11
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.540
toolkit created when I published the first time,

12
00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:30.980
and I don't need to change any of them.

13
00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.030
There's only one more page, and that's the review page,

14
00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.550
so I'll just click the deploy button on there.

15
00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:41.340
Although we need to upload the application deployment package just like before.

16
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.450
This time it doesn't need to also create the environment.

17
00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:45.790
The environment already exists.

18
00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:47.940
We're just replacing some of the code.

19
00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.660
So this time the entire process only takes a couple of minutes

20
00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.550
from its initial updating status to when it's completed and the

21
00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.520
environment status is again healthy.

22
00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:03.290
Now let's try that euro again and into the weather forecast controller,

23
00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:04.840
and it's working.

24
00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:09.540
Now let's try the authors controller that has to interact with the database,

25
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.020
and there it ISS the author and book data,

26
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:22.000
and I'll scroll down so you can see that it's the correct data because there's April space book with a coming soon note in front of it.
