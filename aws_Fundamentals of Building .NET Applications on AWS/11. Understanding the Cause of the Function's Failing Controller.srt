00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:04,580
[Autogenerated] the authors controller isn't working yet because

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:09,030
we need to tell the VPC where the artist database is that the

3
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:12,120
function is allowed to access it.

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:17,120
This will involve a few steps, and the first time I did this, it was confusing.

5
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,980
Now that I've done it a few times, it doesn't seem like a big deal.

6
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:24,220
So I hope you'll trust me to help you through this first

7
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:29,060
pass and that once you've done it, you'll also think it's not a big deal,

8
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:30,000
either.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,030
Let's start with a bit of trouble shooting by looking

10
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:39,690
at the function in the tool kit, I'll open up a view into our lambda function.

11
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:43,510
The first thing you'll notice is this test function page.

12
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:45,680
When I first saw this,

13
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:51,430
I thought maybe it was a way to debug the deployed function from visual studio.

14
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:52,940
But it's not.

15
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:56,660
It's functionality isn't quite relevant to my particular function,

16
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:00,870
so I'm going to skip that and head to the logs.

17
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:03,940
Click the download button next to the log,

18
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:09,040
which pulls the log down from AWS and opens it up in note pad well

19
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,320
for me because that's my default text editor.

20
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,040
If the problem with authors controller was related to my

21
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:19,340
code and an exception had been thrown.

22
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:23,910
I would see the stack trace details in here, but this is clean.

23
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:28,140
There's a little bit of reporting from AWS about its activity and a

24
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:31,240
little bit of logging information from Kestral,

25
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,290
but no problems reported here.

26
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:37,170
So that tells me the problem is outside of my coat and

27
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:39,880
the issue is once again about a bill.

28
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:40,260
US.

29
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:45,810
Resource is needing permission to interact with each other for a function.

30
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:48,410
We saw that differently than we did for the Far Gate

31
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:51,840
Container or the elastic Beanstalk website.

32
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,640
And you can do this in the tool kit on the configuration page

33
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,270
of the function view or in the console,

34
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:02,940
and it's a lot simpler to do right in the tool kit.

35
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:06,760
Well, to be honest, if you don't mind hand coating at all,

36
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:11,060
you could even specify these details in the Serverless template file.

37
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:18,000
But I prefer taking advantage of the drop downs and check boxes that I get from the other sources
