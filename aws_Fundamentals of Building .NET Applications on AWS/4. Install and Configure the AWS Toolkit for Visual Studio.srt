00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:05,600
[Autogenerated] the toolkit for visual studio has been around for a while.

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:10,700
The latest version installs in Visual Studio 2017 and 2019.

3
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:16,070
It's also notable that there is a get hub repository for the tool kit,

4
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:19,380
but it's not for the tool kits code.

5
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:24,990
If this is, this is the place where you can raise issues with the tool kit,

6
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:29,680
you can install the toolkit right from Visual Studio's manage extensions.

7
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,050
As with any extension,

8
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:34,130
you'll have to close visual studio for the extension to install.

9
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:36,870
So I've already restarted visual studio.

10
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,020
After installing,

11
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:41,980
you'll find the AWS explore under the View menu and on

12
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:44,230
the first time you open this explorer,

13
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:47,580
or for as long as you haven't set up any credentials yet.

14
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:52,380
The getting started with AWS Toolkit window will also open up This one no

15
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:56,020
provides guidance for creating an identity and access management,

16
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:58,670
or I am user.

17
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:03,240
Your AWS account, also referred to as a root account,

18
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:07,540
is for the overall management of your account and for the billing.

19
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:10,070
But you'll do the actual work of creating and

20
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:13,270
interacting with services with an I am user,

21
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:17,440
and you can have a great number of I AM users under your account.

22
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:21,370
The instructions provide a link to the I Am user's page in the AWS

23
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:25,000
console and describes the configurations you should use.

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,580
It also helps you get this credentials onto your computer so

25
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:30,530
that the toolkit can use them as well.

26
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:33,140
So let's walk through that process.

27
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:36,180
I'll start by clicking the link to the I Am user's page.

28
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,770
You will need to be logged into your AWS account

29
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:40,420
before you can create a new user.

30
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:42,550
And if you haven't created an account yet,

31
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:46,840
you'll get a number of prompts to make sure that you're able to do that.

32
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,170
I already had some users from some previous work I've done.

33
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,180
But if yours is a brand new account,

34
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:56,040
then of course your I am users list will be empty.

35
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:00,420
Notice that on the header of the page you can see my Amazon account name,

36
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:04,690
and also there's a drop down for regions which is set to global and in fact,

37
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:07,370
global is the only option for I am user,

38
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:08,840
so I don't have to worry about that.

39
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,520
But I thought I would mention it because, of course I clicked on it.

40
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:16,570
So click add user and then I'll give the new user name

41
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:19,530
and I'm calling mine Julie Plural site.

42
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:22,850
Then, as for the guidance on that getting started page,

43
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:26,540
the next thing to do is to select programmatic access.

44
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:30,100
This will give a P eyes s decays and other development tools

45
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:33,340
like visual studio access to services.

46
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:36,890
Then go to the next page where you'll select permissions and you

47
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:40,770
can assign a user policy to the I am user again.

48
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:46,410
As per that getting started page, you can select an existing AWS policy,

49
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:48,440
so I'll click that.

50
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:52,340
And then there's a list of every single built in policy

51
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:56,250
because this I am account is on lee for demo purposes and

52
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,310
won't be used in real application.

53
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:02,860
You can just select the very 1st 1 administrator access that gives

54
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:06,430
the I am user wide open access to the services.

55
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:11,040
The getting started page suggests this or a power user policy.

56
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,510
If you prefer the 2nd 1 you can filter on Power User

57
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:16,740
and the last one on that list.

58
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:20,260
Power User access will also work for our purposes,

59
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:22,810
but I'm just gonna leave mine with the administrator,

60
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:27,180
access the next pages to assign tags and I'm just going to skip that.

61
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:30,470
Then you get a chance to review your settings and finally

62
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:35,040
click the create user button to finalize the new I am user

63
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,470
on the confirmation page.

64
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:39,360
There's a button to download a C S V file,

65
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,160
and you need that that contains the credentials that

66
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,020
you can import into visual studio.

67
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:48,210
Now that I've downloaded the CSB file, I'm done with the AWS console,

68
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:51,610
and I'll close that and return to visual studio.

69
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:54,390
The bottom of the getting started page has a form for

70
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:57,240
providing thes I am credentials,

71
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:01,670
and you can just click the import from C S V file button and select the

72
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:06,410
credentials file that you downloaded two important official studio.

73
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:10,620
Before we save enclosed, I want you to see one more thing here.

74
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:11,530
Back at the top.

75
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:15,560
There's a warning that the tool will collect analytics and by default,

76
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,280
a check box that you acknowledged it.

77
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:22,030
Unfortunately, this is opt out instead of opt in.

78
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:25,610
But if you prefer not provide this information for some reason,

79
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:27,820
you can opt out in the tool kits.

80
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,320
Options settings.

81
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,070
Finally,

82
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:33,300
saving close will save the new default profile that's

83
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:36,800
tied to the imported I am credentials,

84
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,040
and now the AWS explorers shows that it's using that default profile.

85
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,990
You can see the list of all services that the toolkit connects to on AWS.

86
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:49,940
Also notice that it's defaulting to the U S East region.

87
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:52,570
So when you expand any of these service notes,

88
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:56,820
it will only show the services in the region that selected in

89
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:59,340
the next module out of all of these services,

90
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,220
we'll be focusing on the R.

91
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:07,000
D s service. RTs stands for relational database service.
