1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:04,010
[Autogenerated] deploying the serverless application will be

2
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:06,830
like the other deployments in two parts.

3
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:11,030
The first part will be pushing the APP and settings up AWS,

4
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:14,940
which will then build up the serverless application components.

5
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:17,970
The second part will be setting up the last bits of

6
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:20,750
security similar to the other deployments,

7
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:24,120
where we need to make sure the function and connect to the

8
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:29,160
VPC where the databases remember that earlier I explained how

9
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,740
in the serverless application,

10
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:33,570
you'll have a specialized lambda function in front

11
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:36,300
of your asp dot net application.

12
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:41,290
After the toolkit sends the code and serverless template file to AWS,

13
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:44,520
AWS will build all of this infrastructure for us,

14
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,080
thanks to the details in that template pile.

15
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:52,590
And those settings are instructions to a service called Plowed Formacion,

16
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:56,080
which lets you describe what resource is air needed and

17
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:59,010
then acts on the instructions you provide.

18
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:03,290
The objects and properties described in the Jason of the Serverless

19
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:07,000
Template file is particular to cloud formation.

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,080
The tool kit has recognized that we've included Lambda

21
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,000
Function AP eyes in our project,

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,340
and there's a new option on the menu published to AWS Lambda.

23
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,060
When we start that task,

24
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:24,530
the toolkit reads some of the needed information from that AWS Lambda Tools

25
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:30,240
defaults Jason file and then asks us to provide some naming.

26
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,310
One name is for a cloud formation stack.

27
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:37,960
That's the set of a W s resource is needed by your

28
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:43,280
application and the second name, just like with the far gate deployment.

29
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,250
The tool kit will push the compiled PO'd for your

30
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:49,660
application into an s three bucket.

31
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:52,300
So we also need to provide a name for that book it.

32
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:53,350
And to be clear,

33
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:58,670
this has nothing to do with that sample s three Proxy controller.

34
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:03,040
This is just AWS using s three to stores and piles.

35
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,830
The bucket name does need to be lower case and the tool kit will be sure

36
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:13,000
to let you know that if it needs to And with that now, I can go ahead and click the publish button
