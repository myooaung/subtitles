00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:03.120
[Autogenerated] There's one last step I want to

2
00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.540
perform on my newly containerized AP I.

3
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.590
I'll add some new data so that you can see something more

4
00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:12.080
than just reading from the database.

5
00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.810
To do this,

6
00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:16.320
I'll head back to postman and I'm Hasting in the Earl

7
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.140
of the Container and notice For now, I'm still targeting a get rest method.

8
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.740
I just want to run that to be sure everything's working here, too.

9
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.340
There's no reason it shouldn't be, but it's just how I roll.

10
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.040
So yes,

11
00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.360
postman is Justus happily hitting the controller and

12
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.650
returning my data as the browser waas.

13
00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:38.990
Now I feel more comfortable doing a post toe.

14
00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:40.170
Add new data.

15
00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.940
I'll start by changing the body to a new Jason document

16
00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.670
where the author name is now Mary O Deli.

17
00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.640
And okay, she hasn't written a book yet,

18
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.280
but today she just achieved her 10th certification and

19
00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.250
it was for a WS Solutions architect.

20
00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.710
So I wanted to find a fun way to congratulate ER.

21
00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.650
There you go and then go ahead and send this request to my comptroller.

22
00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.240
Post meant displays the results,

23
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.110
which is the data along with the ideas generated by the

24
00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.470
database And if I then return to the browser and refresh

25
00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:19.210
the page again and scroll down, there's married at the bottom of my list.

26
00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.040
And, yes, you might notice a gap in the I DS.

27
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:29.000
That's because they did an experiment and then deleted it from database, so everything's as it should be.
