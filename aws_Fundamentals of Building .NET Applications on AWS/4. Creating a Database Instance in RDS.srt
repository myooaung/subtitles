1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:04,500
[Autogenerated] so let's go ahead and create a DB instance.

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,870
Begin by expanding the Amazon RDS note in the AWS Explorer.

3
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:09,180
There,

4
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:12,600
you can see the instances security groups and subject groups

5
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:16,230
related to RTs instances will be empty.

6
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:18,660
If this is your first time around the block,

7
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:23,240
right click instances and choose launch instance to create a new database.

8
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,240
Instance.

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,070
You'll need to configure the instance it's gonna be created.

10
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:29,060
And this just a few short forms.

11
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:31,970
So start by selecting the database engine.

12
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:33,720
I'll choose Sequel Server Express,

13
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:37,430
which doesn't require license If you're looking for sequel server.

14
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:38,740
Local DB.

15
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:42,910
Remember that that's just a subset of sequel server expressed,

16
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:44,800
so you'll be able to use that.

17
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,210
Next.

18
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:47,980
You need to configure the compute size for the instance,

19
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:50,180
and this is called the Instance class.

20
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:53,580
So that's compute power memory, etcetera.

21
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:57,940
Choose Micro because that's the option that's covered by the free tier.

22
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:01,580
Next, leave the storage at 20 gigs again.

23
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:03,810
That's what's covered by the free tier.

24
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:06,960
And then you can give a name to the instance letters.

25
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,510
Numbers are hyphens, Onley no spaces, and there's a 15 character limit,

26
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:12,990
so I'll just stop there.

27
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:16,240
Then you need to add credentials for logging into the server.

28
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,850
And they don't really enforce any rules for the password other than it

29
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:23,210
has to be at least eight alphanumeric characters.

30
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:28,390
In fact, I just typed 12345678 and it didn't complain.

31
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:30,490
So that's not really good password.

32
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:33,330
Instead, I'll paste in something a bit more complicated.

33
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:35,460
We'll need to do some more configuration here,

34
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,950
so don't just skip to finish on the next page.

35
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:40,080
You'll set up the network and security.

36
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:43,100
If this is a new account, you won't have any resource is yet.

37
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:46,420
So leave those defaults for creating a new VPC.

38
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:46,780
Remember,

39
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:52,510
That's virtual Private Cloud and Sub Net group and a 78 group is dedicated.

40
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:54,100
Allocation of A W.

41
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:57,750
S s network resource is you definitely want this test

42
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,730
database instance to be publicly available.

43
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:01,660
In other cases,

44
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:05,360
you'd want it private if it was on Lee going to be access from other

45
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,750
resource is with in AWS and notice down at the bottom.

46
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,120
It's also going to make sure that the VPC,

47
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,950
where my database instances going toe live will

48
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:17,550
allow my i P address to access it.

49
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:19,630
So even though he made it publicly available.

50
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:22,190
It's still totally locked down by default,

51
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:25,670
and it's up to you to configure what public resource is are

52
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:28,940
allowed in the tool kits helping me out here because it's making

53
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,860
an assumption that I will want to connect to the database from

54
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,040
visual studio on my computer.

55
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:37,810
I'm creating this database instance in the US East region,

56
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:40,910
and that's because the tool kits filtering on that region,

57
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:43,030
but that region has three zones.

58
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:47,930
You can specify which zone you want this database instance to be available on,

59
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:49,810
but I'll leave the option at the default,

60
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:53,650
which is no preference, and let AWS pick the zone.

61
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:55,780
Now let's go to the final page.

62
00:02:55,780 --> 00:03:00,740
Normally, it's a great idea to allow the default of backing up automatically.

63
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:05,040
But for this demo, I'm going to change this to no automatic backups.

64
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:10,790
And the only reason is that when the instance is first getting spun up by AWS,

65
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:13,280
it will also create that first backup,

66
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,000
which will add a little more time before the database instance is available.

67
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,640
And since this is just a demo database,

68
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,320
I don't plan to have that database around prolong anyway,

69
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,700
so I'm not gonna waste the time of the backup.

70
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,660
That's the only change on that page,

71
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:32,740
and the next and very last page is just a summary of your choices.

72
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:35,820
So I'll go ahead and click launch and right away a window

73
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:39,960
with a list of DB instances opens up and shows the

74
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,070
instance that is now being created.

75
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:45,310
And I think the most interesting thing here is that it shows the

76
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:50,100
status of this instance is creating with the yellow dot You can

77
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,790
see some of the other settings I chose.

78
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:55,710
A swell just in case you've been experimenting,

79
00:03:55,710 --> 00:04:00,230
I want to alert you to a possibly confusing error you might get if you've

80
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:03,630
exceeded the limit for VP sees on the free account,

81
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:06,940
which is five after clicking the launch button.

82
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:10,430
If there are already five V PC's and you're letting the tool kit

83
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:13,560
create a new PPC for you with this instance,

84
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,720
you'll see an air message saying Error launching DB

85
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,000
Instance db Sub Net group default Not found.

86
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,240
It's not saying Oh, you have too many VP sees,

87
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,180
which is really the problem in this particular case.

88
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:30,690
This happened to me a number of times and it was a little confusing,

89
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:32,180
so I just wanted to let you know,

90
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:36,910
in case you do get into this position while we're waiting.

91
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:41,140
Let's go to the management console to see a little bit of what's going on,

92
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:43,520
because I've done some work in the console already.

93
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,240
It shows shortcuts for some of the services I've recently accessed,

94
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:50,720
and RDS is among them, so that's an easy way to get there.

95
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,060
But you could also find RTs under the database section,

96
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,510
or just use a filter to find it quickly.

97
00:04:56,510 --> 00:05:00,540
Once you're in the RTs view, if you look in this resource is section,

98
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:05,840
you can see that it shows you're using one of 40 allowed DB instances.

99
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,630
That one is the one that's getting created right now.

100
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:11,730
Click on that to get a list of all your instances.

101
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:14,890
And even though this says thes your databases,

102
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:17,890
what it really means is it's your DB instances,

103
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:21,800
and here it shows that the status of our new instance is still creating,

104
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,880
and it will be for a few more minutes.

105
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:27,730
Remember, overall creating the database will take about 10 minutes,

106
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:29,340
so if you're following along,

107
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:33,010
you can put the video on pause for a few minutes while you're DB instance is

108
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:36,900
still getting spun up and then come back to continue exploring a bit more

109
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:46,000
about working with the instance in the tool kit and seeing just a few more bits of info about it here in the console.
