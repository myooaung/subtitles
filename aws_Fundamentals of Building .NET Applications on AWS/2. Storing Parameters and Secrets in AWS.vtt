[Autogenerated] AWS has a number of ways to store secrets

2
00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:07.310
that you can access from other AWS services.

3
00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:12.040
I'll give you a very quick explanation of the two most common ones.

4
00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:17.920
The first is a parameter store, and that's part of the AWS systems manager.

5
00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.310
The systems manager is a centralized location for performing a

6
00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.640
lot of operational tasks for your services.

7
00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.580
Parameter store is just one of the many capabilities in there,

8
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.490
and the primaries stored lets you store configuration

9
00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:34.960
information as key value pairs.

10
00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.700
It's a fairly simple solution, and it's accessible by way of a P eyes.

11
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.560
The second option is the A.

12
00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.840
W s Secrets manager.

13
00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.700
This is its own service,

14
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.410
as opposed to being under the umbrella of the systems manager.

15
00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.400
You can store secrets in there, but there are additional management features.

16
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.580
Here's a high level comparison of those two options.

17
00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.590
The first point is cost.

18
00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.590
There's no additional charge for using the parameter store.

19
00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:02.350
However,

20
00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.620
The Secrets manager has a pay as you go plan where there is a storage

21
00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.060
fee for each secret per month as well as bulk rates.

22
00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.470
If you have 10,000 or more secrets and secrets,

23
00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.340
Manager is not included in the free tier,

24
00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.100
so you do pay for every single secret.

25
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.260
I could probably stop right there because that alone is

26
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.300
enough to ensure will be using the Systems Manager parameter

27
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.610
store for our sample application.

28
00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.140
Both options are key value stores.

29
00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:39.000
Both are securely stored with encryption, but the secrets manager does have more features for managing your secrets.
