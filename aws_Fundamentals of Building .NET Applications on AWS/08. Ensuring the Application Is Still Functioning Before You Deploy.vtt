00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:03.430
[Autogenerated] because we made a lot of changes here.

2
00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:07.070
It's a good idea to make sure the application is still working.

3
00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.690
However,

4
00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:10.800
it's really important to understand that there's no way to

5
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.290
test out the serverless application functionality on your

6
00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:18.040
computer that can Onley happen on AWS.

7
00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.940
But when debugging locally,

8
00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:24.180
as explained earlier dot net Core will look for the main method,

9
00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.040
which it will find in the program dot CS file dot net Core will have no

10
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.240
clue about the innit method in the land entry point class.

11
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.080
Also, keep in mind that in this version of the APP,

12
00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.120
we didn't tell the host to skip reading from the systems

13
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.340
manager if we're in development mode,

14
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.350
that was a change we made for the docker support.

15
00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.430
So my expectation here is that the a p I will run locally it will read

16
00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:54.670
the database credentials from A W s systems manager and connect to the

17
00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.990
database in the RTs instance on AWS, then the local AP.

18
00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:04.630
I will display the results and you can see based on the controller output.

19
00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:09.440
We're seeing data that we know is Onley in our cloud database.

20
00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:17.000
Not only do we see the coming soon note on April space book, but they're soliciting for Mary our Delhi as well
