1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:03,840
<v Lecturer>So let's now allow users</v>

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,883
to upload their photos right on our website.

3
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:11,640
And so this is what we want.

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,760
When we click here, we basically want

5
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:15,915
to open a new window for which we can select

6
00:00:15,915 --> 00:00:19,370
a new image to upload and then when we click

7
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:21,380
this button and submit a form

8
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:23,990
of course then we want to upload that image

9
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:27,520
into our backend and update the user, right.

10
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,528
And so the first step into doing that

11
00:00:29,528 --> 00:00:33,400
will be to add a new input element to our html.

12
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,490
So basically to our pack template

13
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:37,850
which will then allow that file selector

14
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:39,503
to open when we click here.

15
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:43,800
So, let's go to our views

16
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:48,800
and to account and so it's this form

17
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:51,720
where we now have to add that input.

18
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:55,420
So right now we have that link here which says new photo.

19
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:58,800
But of course, it's not a link that we're going to use.

20
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,280
So this was really just a placeholder.

21
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,360
And so let's get rid of it.

22
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,063
So what we need is an input.

23
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,803
Off to type file.

24
00:01:09,955 --> 00:01:13,110
All right, so before, for the name

25
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:15,980
we had an input with the type text.

26
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:19,040
We also have input with the type of email

27
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,925
and there are also a special ones for password.

28
00:01:22,925 --> 00:01:26,210
So input for password

29
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:30,283
and so for files, there is one of course for files.

30
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:35,263
We can then specify which kind of file we actually accept.

31
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,950
And we can do something like this.

32
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:43,410
Image and then all of them.

33
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:46,210
So basically all formats get their images

34
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:49,010
so which have a mind type starting

35
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:50,823
with image are accepted here.

36
00:01:53,054 --> 00:01:55,780
Now let's also give this here a class name

37
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:59,930
so that it appears nicely formatted on our page.

38
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:03,660
And so this is the class name that I have in my css.

39
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:06,940
And now also giving it an ID so that we can

40
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:08,440
then select it in java script.

41
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,690
Add that as photo and finally just like the

42
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:15,840
other fields, we also give it a name.

43
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,420
So name of photo as well.

44
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:23,093
And of course it is photo because that's the name

45
00:02:23,093 --> 00:02:25,680
that we have in our user document

46
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,063
and it's also the field name that multer is expecting.

47
00:02:30,106 --> 00:02:34,410
So this here is upload and then we also specify

48
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:35,483
a label for it.

49
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:40,293
And we set it to four and then the ID

50
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:44,110
of the input element, all right.

51
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:45,570
So I'm not sure if you're familiar

52
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:47,890
with how that works in html

53
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:49,640
but it's also not really important.

54
00:02:51,329 --> 00:02:53,600
So the way it happens is that when we click

55
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,320
this label here, it will then actually activate

56
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,610
the input element which has the ID

57
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:00,500
that we specify here in form.

58
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,870
And so in that case that is the photo, all right.

59
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:05,343
And actually it's this label here

60
00:03:05,343 --> 00:03:09,403
which will have the text choose new photo.

61
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,950
And so when we then click the label

62
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:14,597
it will then activate this input

63
00:03:14,597 --> 00:03:16,830
which in turn will open up the window

64
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,913
from which we can select a file.

65
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:23,090
And so that's all we need to do for the input here.

66
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:26,290
Now, just like before, there are two possible ways

67
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:28,710
of sending this data to the server.

68
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:31,480
So first, without the API as we did

69
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,840
in one previous lecture.

70
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,470
We already find the action that we want to take

71
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:37,370
and also the method.

72
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:38,760
And with that the data is

73
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,180
then directly sent to the server.

74
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,130
Now if we wanted to send a file

75
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:45,440
using this method, we then would need

76
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,220
to specify another option here.

77
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,801
And that is the enc type.

78
00:03:49,801 --> 00:03:54,520
So enc type would have to be multi-part form data.

79
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:59,520
So multi-part slash form data, all right.

80
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:06,090
And so here again, we have this name multi-part.

81
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:07,948
And so as we said before, multi-part

82
00:04:07,948 --> 00:04:11,220
is always for sending files to the server.

83
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,864
And again we actually need the multer middleware

84
00:04:13,864 --> 00:04:17,164
to handle this multi-part form data, all right.

85
00:04:17,164 --> 00:04:20,650
And actually the name multer comes from multi-part.

86
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:23,317
So mult, multer, okay.

87
00:04:23,317 --> 00:04:26,830
Anyway again if we wanted to send the data

88
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:29,320
without an API, we would always have

89
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,200
to specify this enc type.

90
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,740
Otherwise the form would simply ignore the file

91
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,623
and not send it, okay.

92
00:04:35,623 --> 00:04:38,370
But as we already know, we are actually

93
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:41,780
using it with the API, right.

94
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:44,727
And so we do not need to specify this enc type

95
00:04:44,727 --> 00:04:48,630
but we will kind of have to do it programmatically.

96
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:51,382
And so let's actually do that.

97
00:04:51,382 --> 00:04:54,180
So let's now send our data, including

98
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,920
of course the photo by doing an API call

99
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,970
such as we've been doing in the last section.

100
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:04,100
And so we need to now open in our public folder

101
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:08,973
and from their js, we open up index.js.

102
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:13,560
And so right here is where we actually

103
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,010
send the data to be updated on the server.

104
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:19,260
Well we're not really sending them here

105
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:21,960
but we're selecting them from the form

106
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,790
and then passing them into update settings.

107
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:27,260
All right, but now remember how I said

108
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,590
that we kind of needed to programmatically

109
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:32,660
recreate a multi-part form data?

110
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,893
And so we need to do it like this.

111
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:46,740
Let's call it form and then new form data.

112
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:51,200
All right, and now onto that form

113
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,883
we need to keep appending new data.

114
00:05:53,883 --> 00:05:57,152
And basically one append for each

115
00:05:57,152 --> 00:05:59,143
of the data that we want to send.

116
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:04,400
So form.append and the first one is the name.

117
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,250
So we specify name here and then the value of the name.

118
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:11,000
And so that is of course this one.

119
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,363
So let's grab that, paste it here and duplicate it.

120
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:19,653
And next up is the email, okay.

121
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:24,580
Then let's get rid of this enter into update settings.

122
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:28,040
We then pass the form, okay.

123
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,560
And or a text call using axios

124
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,350
will then actually recognize this form

125
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,480
here as an object and will work

126
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,550
just the same as it did before, okay.

127
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:39,900
So here in update settings where we pass

128
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,178
in the data, which is then passed

129
00:06:42,178 --> 00:06:44,980
in here into the axios request,

130
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:47,543
we do not need to change anything.

131
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:51,810
All right, so this is equivalent

132
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:54,380
to what we had before with name and email

133
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:57,050
but now of course let's also add the photo

134
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:59,380
which is the entire reason why we now

135
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:00,580
have to do it like this.

136
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:07,590
So form.append again then the name

137
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:10,400
we want to give it is of course again, photo

138
00:07:12,093 --> 00:07:12,970
and then document

139
00:07:14,176 --> 00:07:17,860
.getelementbyid which is also photo

140
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:22,930
but now it is not .value

141
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:25,920
but instead .files, all right.

142
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,170
And these files are actually in array

143
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:30,260
and so since there's only one,

144
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:33,260
we need to select that first element in the array

145
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:34,733
and so that's zero.

146
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,810
All right, and let's actually log this form to the console

147
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:42,340
just 'til we get a quick look

148
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,870
at what this form actually is.

149
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:48,280
But in a nutshell, as I said before,

150
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:52,480
we basically recreate this multi-part form data.

151
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:55,200
And so that's actually why it's called form data

152
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:58,640
is because, well, that form data is also here

153
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:02,173
in this multi-part enc type, okay.

154
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:06,450
So, I guess that is actually enough

155
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:08,670
for us to now try this out.

156
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:10,860
So as I said, in update settings,

157
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:13,030
there's nothing that we need to change

158
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:15,320
and also the update me endpoint

159
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,630
where we are submitting this request tool

160
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:21,040
so this one has also already working

161
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:25,230
and ready to accept images and even to resize them, right.

162
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:28,319
And so let's now go ahead and try this.

163
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,050
And so let's reload this one more time.

164
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:36,031
And so let's see, and indeed we now get

165
00:08:36,031 --> 00:08:38,450
our file picker basically.

166
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:40,550
So this window where we can now select

167
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:42,370
the file and what I'm going to do

168
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:45,620
is to basically put back the original image

169
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:47,730
that we had on this user.

170
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:52,513
So that's on desktop, natours, public, image

171
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:58,700
users, and it was user 11, so this one.

172
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,050
And so that's now uploaded.

173
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:06,940
So open, save to settings, and data update is successfully.

174
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:10,180
Now it doesn't reflect here immediately.

175
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:13,280
Neither here nor up here but it should

176
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,393
so once we upload this page.

177
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:19,540
And we could indeed also do it with java script

178
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,620
but that's actually a lot of work.

179
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,740
I'd tried to do it and I did it

180
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:26,800
but then I thought that it's just too much work

181
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,630
and not worth to implement it here.

182
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:32,040
But anyway just to test if it actually worked,

183
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,320
we need to now reload the page.

184
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,840
And it did.

185
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:39,320
Here is now the new image that we just uploaded.

186
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,450
So, great.

187
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:44,210
Let's take a look at the folder itself.

188
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:46,530
If it's actually there, also, and if

189
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:48,810
it was correctly transformed.

190
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:52,030
So that's an image.

191
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:53,293
Let's reload it here.

192
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,663
And so now I'm not sure which one it is.

193
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:02,690
Ah, exactly.

194
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:07,200
So 500 times 500 and now that it's completely blurred

195
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,440
because the original image was a lot smaller.

196
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,643
But nevermind, that doesn't matter at all.

197
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:17,570
What matters is that we can now actually upload photos

198
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:19,830
right from this form.

199
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:22,480
I want that's all to take a look at our console here

200
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:27,480
at that form data that I thought that we had logged

201
00:10:27,546 --> 00:10:29,530
and it didn't appear here

202
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:32,184
because we already reloaded the page.

203
00:10:32,184 --> 00:10:36,543
But anyway, I wanted to put the other image back here.

204
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:41,820
So the one that we actually uploaded before

205
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:46,820
which is in dev-data, image, and aarav.

206
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:53,340
All right, data updated successfully.

207
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:56,760
Let's just quickly take a look at our phone data here.

208
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:00,173
Ah, but I guess we cannot really see what we have here.

209
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,223
Let's see.

210
00:11:04,045 --> 00:11:06,689
Nah, we cannot really see what we have.

211
00:11:06,689 --> 00:11:09,160
Okay, so I never took a look at this.

212
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,110
And I thought we could maybe

213
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:12,850
see the information but nevermind.

214
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:16,170
What matters is that it actually worked.

215
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:18,191
So, if we reload now, then of course

216
00:11:18,191 --> 00:11:21,940
this older image is back again.

217
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:25,000
Awesome, so once more, this application

218
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,583
is really starting to feel more and more real work like.
