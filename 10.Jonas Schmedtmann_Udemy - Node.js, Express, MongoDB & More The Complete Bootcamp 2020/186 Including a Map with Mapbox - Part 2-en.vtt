00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.163
<v ->Let's now continue building our map integration.</v>

2
00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.637
And so let's now actually head over to Mapbox.

3
00:00:11.036 --> 00:00:15.090
And so, I'm using Mapbox instead of Google Maps now

4
00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:16.710
and that's because some time ago,

5
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.260
Google Maps started to actually require

6
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.300
a credit card from you in order

7
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.220
to be able to use Google Maps.

8
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.640
And I don't think that's a good idea for a course like this

9
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.160
and, actually, I also really like Mapbox,

10
00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.723
and so, I think it's perfect for us to use in this course.

11
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.720
They also have excellent documentation

12
00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.130
that we're gonna try out in a second here.

13
00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.330
But for now, let's start and create a new account.

14
00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.623
So just hit here on start building.

15
00:00:48.208 --> 00:00:51.960
And then, of course, create your free account.

16
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.370
I already have one and so, just pause the video

17
00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.200
at this point in order to create that account.

18
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.210
And after creating your account, you should

19
00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.960
land on a page that looks something like this.

20
00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.009
Now by the time you are watching this video,

21
00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:06.820
this page here might, of course,

22
00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.430
have changed, and probably it has,

23
00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.020
but what we need to do now is to

24
00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.900
find a link which says something like this,

25
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.281
so install the maps software development kit,

26
00:01:17.281 --> 00:01:21.850
so this here, or also integrate Mapbox,

27
00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.455
which should be pretty much the same.

28
00:01:24.455 --> 00:01:29.025
So I'll click here on install the maps for JavaScript.

29
00:01:29.025 --> 00:01:30.720
And what we're gonna do here

30
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.100
is to use the Mapbox CDN

31
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.050
so the content delivery network

32
00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:36.500
and for now at least

33
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.503
not the NPM module bundler.

34
00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.500
So the first step, as it says here,

35
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.941
is to include these files here and to the had HTML file.

36
00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:51.121
And so that's where we now need that

37
00:01:51.121 --> 00:01:54.663
extend head technique that we had before.

38
00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:58.860
And so that's where we now actually need

39
00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.293
that extending the head technique.

40
00:02:02.443 --> 00:02:04.060
Here in the tour,

41
00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.690
remember how we moved this out of the head, actually.

42
00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.550
But now we still need some stuff that we

43
00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.940
need to append to the head.

44
00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.533
And so that's this script, and this style sheet as well.

45
00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:19.833
Let's quickly translate this here to pug.

46
00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.533
And the link as well,

47
00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.300
and that's actually it.

48
00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:34.663
Let's get rid of this part,

49
00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.370
and let's go back to the next step here.

50
00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.720
Next up, we need to copy this JavaScript code here,

51
00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.885
into our file.

52
00:02:45.885 --> 00:02:48.050
And to our script, of course.

53
00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.140
So right here into mapbox.js.

54
00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.860
Now you will probably not have this access token

55
00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.360
at this point,

56
00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.180
and so it either required you to already do it,

57
00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.343
or otherwise I will show you how to do it in a second.

58
00:03:02.586 --> 00:03:05.230
Let's just indent this part here.

59
00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.510
With this, we're actually already good to go.

60
00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.640
This should in fact already create a map

61
00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.090
and display it on our page.

62
00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.760
That's because the container here is set to map.

63
00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.260
And what that means is that it will put the map

64
00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.270
on an element with the ID of map.

65
00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:26.410
That's why here, in our tour, we have

66
00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.010
this element here,

67
00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.003
oh, where is that?

68
00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.760
So right here, we have an element with ID map.

69
00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.730
The reason for that is that here in Mapbox,

70
00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.390
we actually need an element with

71
00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.940
an ID that we can then specify here.

72
00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.920
And the default is map,

73
00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.750
and so that's how I called it in html.

74
00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.900
Then we also have this default style here,

75
00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.700
that we're gonna change in a second.

76
00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:54.393
For now, let's go back to our instructions here,

77
00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.720
and so it says that we're done here.

78
00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.707
But now let's actually go back to our account

79
00:04:02.707 --> 00:04:06.185
and create that token that we need

80
00:04:06.185 --> 00:04:09.650
in order to be able to actually access Mapbox.

81
00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:11.460
Please don't just copy my token,

82
00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:13.990
that's not going to work well for you.

83
00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:16.270
But instead, create your own.

84
00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:19.363
You can just create a new name for it.

85
00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.713
Let's just call it something like this.

86
00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.200
And then create token here.

87
00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.550
Then you put your password,

88
00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.640
and so, you can then use that token.

89
00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.150
So, again, I'm not sure if it already created

90
00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.860
this token for you, or if you really needed

91
00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.360
to create a new one.

92
00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.500
Anyway, it's also nice to have one token for each project,

93
00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:47.820
so that you can then restrict

94
00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.668
that token to only that project.

95
00:04:50.668 --> 00:04:54.160
I created my account here a long time ago,

96
00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.530
and so I'm not really sure, again, how that worked,

97
00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:01.073
but anyway, having that token you should now be good to go.

98
00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:07.883
In fact, this should now already display our default map.

99
00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:13.990
So let's reload, and indeed, this is our default map.

100
00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:15.960
It doesn't look really nice,

101
00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.313
well we can zoom in,

102
00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:21.620
but really, the style isn't all that nice,

103
00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:24.110
and doesn't really match our website,

104
00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:25.090
and of course,

105
00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:27.198
we also do not have our locations

106
00:05:27.198 --> 00:05:29.627
anywhere plotted to the map.

107
00:05:29.627 --> 00:05:33.700
And so let's now take care of all of that.

108
00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.914
Let's go back to Mapbox,

109
00:05:35.914 --> 00:05:38.783
and now we go into our design studio.

110
00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.900
Let's just click here on "start designing a map,"

111
00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:44.720
or again, if your website looks a

112
00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.200
bit different at this point,

113
00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:49.313
then just search for the design studio.

114
00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:53.093
Maybe it shows up somewhere here.

115
00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:57.433
So let's try that.

116
00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:04.330
Here, we can really do all kinds of stuff

117
00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:07.010
regarding designing a map.

118
00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:10.340
Actually, this is not really what I expected,

119
00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:13.670
because it's a bit too complex to change

120
00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:15.090
all of this stuff here,

121
00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:18.670
but there are some default styles,

122
00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:20.670
ah yeah, this is what I was looking for.

123
00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:23.640
Let's create new style here,

124
00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:27.790
and then from there we can kind of choose a default.

125
00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:30.483
And really what I want is this light style.

126
00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:34.560
So create, and actually I'm very happy with

127
00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.330
the way it looks out of the box.

128
00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:39.972
Now, for some reason I don't see anything here,

129
00:06:39.972 --> 00:06:43.937
okay, that's because it was zoomed into the sea.

130
00:06:43.937 --> 00:06:48.937
But anyway, let's now zoom in somewhere here,

131
00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:53.830
and I think it looks pretty nice already,

132
00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:57.407
and so let's just add a name to it here,

133
00:06:57.407 --> 00:06:58.550
and so I'm calling it

134
00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:04.968
Natour's Video Recording

135
00:07:04.968 --> 00:07:08.430
because I already have a Natour's style,

136
00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:11.724
but you of course can call it anything you want.

137
00:07:11.724 --> 00:07:16.340
Let's confirm the name here, go back,

138
00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:19.230
and then we here on share and use.

139
00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:23.393
And what we want is not share, but instead use.

140
00:07:23.393 --> 00:07:28.393
Somewhere down here, we should see our style URL,

141
00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:30.960
and so, yeah, that's the one.

142
00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:34.877
So it has to be a URL basically starting with Mapbox.

143
00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:40.630
Let's just copy it, go back,

144
00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:43.640
and then replace the style that we have here as a default,

145
00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:45.363
with the one that we just created.

146
00:07:47.699 --> 00:07:49.363
Give it a save,

147
00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:51.630
and

148
00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:56.650
yeah, that looks much better.

149
00:07:56.650 --> 00:07:59.650
And it is exactly the style that we just created.

150
00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:02.473
So we can now zoom in, zoom out,

151
00:08:02.473 --> 00:08:04.830
or actually the other way around,

152
00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:07.433
we can pan the map to wherever we want,

153
00:08:08.964 --> 00:08:13.136
and we can also define a ton of properties,

154
00:08:13.136 --> 00:08:15.123
of options to this map.

155
00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:17.810
Right now, whenever we load the map,

156
00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:19.230
it always looks the same,

157
00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:21.510
always centered here in Boston.

158
00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:24.230
But we can change that by specifying

159
00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:26.803
the center here.

160
00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:31.580
And so we need to pass in an array of two coordinates.

161
00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:34.610
Let's actually get the one from LA

162
00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:37.473
that we used before in Postman,

163
00:08:42.356 --> 00:08:43.189
So exactly this,

164
00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:51.870
but, actually, Mapbox is exactly like MongoDB,

165
00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:55.200
in aspect to first requiring a longitude,

166
00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.603
and then the latitude.

167
00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:00.020
We need to switch them here around.

168
00:09:02.925 --> 00:09:05.363
And let's take a look at what we get.

169
00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:10.083
And, well, that doesn't really take us anywhere.

170
00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:15.953
Let's also specify a zoom level here.

171
00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:18.400
Let's say four.

172
00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:19.843
Maybe that fixes it.

173
00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:29.153
And actually, that was this illusion.

174
00:09:30.221 --> 00:09:33.150
So there are different zoom levels.

175
00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:35.820
For example we can try out one here as well,

176
00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:38.760
and that should be then way more zoomed in,

177
00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:41.460
or maybe zoomed out, I'm not really sure.

178
00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:45.040
Ah, okay, so that really zooms it out all the way.

179
00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:46.943
So let's say 10 here for example,

180
00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:51.430
and as you see I really like to play around

181
00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:53.320
with this kind of stuff,

182
00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:57.360
and yeah, at 10 it's now really zoomed close.

183
00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:00.913
We can also say that we want it to not be interactive,

184
00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:04.400
and so that's very simple.

185
00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:07.683
Let's set interactive to false.

186
00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:10.610
And then basically your map is going

187
00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:13.823
to look like a simple image on your website.

188
00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:18.570
So as you see, I cannot scroll anything here,

189
00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:20.650
and I can also not pan it.

190
00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:22.955
So there's nothing I can do now.

191
00:10:22.955 --> 00:10:25.940
And these are actually just a couple of options

192
00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:26.803
that we can set.

193
00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:32.090
Let's actually go back here to Mapbox,

194
00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:36.093
and to the documentation and Mapbox JavaScript.

195
00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:42.020
Here you get all the documentation for really

196
00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:46.300
everything you can do with the JavaScript version of Mapbox.

197
00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:48.790
What I just wanted to show you is that the stuff that

198
00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:51.240
I just showed you is actually here.

199
00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:53.550
So we have the container that we specified,

200
00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:55.023
we have the style,

201
00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:57.970
and we have really a bunch of stuff.

202
00:10:57.970 --> 00:10:59.720
So interactive,

203
00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:02.750
and if you want you can of course play around

204
00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:03.873
with all of these.

205
00:11:05.192 --> 00:11:08.120
I just wanted to show you that this is how you

206
00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:11.400
can learn some more stuff about Mapbox.

207
00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:14.496
Now, we actually don't want any of this.

208
00:11:14.496 --> 00:11:17.800
Because we don't want to center the map anywhere,

209
00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:20.490
but instead we want it to automatically figure out

210
00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:24.551
the position of the map based on our tour location points.

211
00:11:24.551 --> 00:11:26.739
What we're gonna do now is basically put

212
00:11:26.739 --> 00:11:30.410
all the locations for a certain tour on the map,

213
00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:32.660
and then allow the map to basically figure out

214
00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:36.180
automatically which portion of the map it should display

215
00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:39.280
in order to fit all of these points correctly.

216
00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:41.540
The first thing that we need to do is to

217
00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:43.713
create a bound variable.

218
00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:52.060
Bounds equal a new Mapbox GL.latitutde longitude bounds.

219
00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:03.320
And we get access to this Mapbox object

220
00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:05.520
because we included the Mapbox library

221
00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:06.983
at the beginning of our page.

222
00:12:09.210 --> 00:12:10.113
Right here,

223
00:12:11.270 --> 00:12:12.883
including this script here,

224
00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:15.760
so this Mapbox library,

225
00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:18.760
this is what exposes the Mapbox GL object,

226
00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:21.193
which we can then use throughout our site.

227
00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:26.870
This bounds object here is basically the area

228
00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:29.589
that will be displayed on the map.

229
00:12:29.589 --> 00:12:32.860
We will now extend that with all the locations

230
00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:35.043
that are in our locations array.

231
00:12:35.043 --> 00:12:37.597
And this will make a bit more sense once we

232
00:12:37.597 --> 00:12:39.333
actually start using that.

233
00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:44.050
Let's now loop through all our locations

234
00:12:44.050 --> 00:12:46.203
and add a marker for each of them.

235
00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:49.750
For each,

236
00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:52.313
and let's see lock for locations,

237
00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:58.150
and so here we want to add a marker.

238
00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:00.160
And for that, we actually need to create

239
00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.053
a new html element,

240
00:13:04.228 --> 00:13:07.900
in this regard, it really is a little bit low level,

241
00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:09.780
but I find that actually really nice,

242
00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:12.230
because, like this, we have a lot of control

243
00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:15.110
over what's actually happening in our map.

244
00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:17.070
And what I'm showing you here is actually just

245
00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:19.366
a tiny fraction of all the great stuff

246
00:13:19.366 --> 00:13:22.083
that you can do with Mapbox.

247
00:13:23.525 --> 00:13:26.593
This here is just a standard JavaScript,

248
00:13:26.593 --> 00:13:28.928
and so we can use create element

249
00:13:28.928 --> 00:13:31.490
in order to create elements.

250
00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:33.040
Just as the name says,

251
00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:35.490
and here we want to create a new diff.

252
00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:38.653
And we also want to give is a class name,

253
00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:46.193
and set that to marker.

254
00:13:47.945 --> 00:13:50.170
And here it is, it's a semicolon.

255
00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:52.500
And so in the CSS we then actually

256
00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:54.313
have a class for this marker.

257
00:13:57.140 --> 00:14:00.870
Marker, here you see the background image that is specified,

258
00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:03.459
which is this green pin here.

259
00:14:03.459 --> 00:14:07.210
That pin that you're gonna see in a second on the map,

260
00:14:07.210 --> 00:14:10.110
is actually a custom image that I designed.

261
00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:13.070
It's not coming directly from Mapbox.

262
00:14:13.070 --> 00:14:16.500
Like this, you can really adjust it to your own style

263
00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:17.333
and your own brand.

264
00:14:17.333 --> 00:14:21.733
I also defined the size of the marker here,

265
00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:25.363
yeah, it's really customizable.

266
00:14:27.362 --> 00:14:32.335
Now we actually create a new marker inside of Mapbox

267
00:14:32.335 --> 00:14:37.257
by saying new Mapbox GL.marker.

268
00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:45.230
And then in there, we pass the element that we just created,

269
00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:49.503
so L, and then we also specify an anchor property.

270
00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:52.090
Which I set

271
00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:54.910
to bottom here.

272
00:14:54.910 --> 00:14:58.610
And what that means is that it's the bottom of the element,

273
00:14:58.610 --> 00:15:01.230
and so in this case the bottom of that pin,

274
00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:04.683
which is going to be located at the exact GPS location.

275
00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:07.710
We could also put it in the center,

276
00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:10.113
but I think it makes more sense that,

277
00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.690
let's open that image up again,

278
00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:16.520
I think it makes more sense that this end here

279
00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:19.110
of the image is the one that really points to the

280
00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:20.663
exact GPS location.

281
00:15:22.512 --> 00:15:26.040
That's what we do with this anchor property.

282
00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:27.680
So that is the marker,

283
00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:31.896
and now, on that, we can call a couple of methods.

284
00:15:31.896 --> 00:15:35.600
Right now, Mapbox knows nothing about the GPS coordinates

285
00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:36.635
of this marker.

286
00:15:36.635 --> 00:15:39.250
We didn't set that anywhere.

287
00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:40.580
Let's do that now,

288
00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:44.960
so set longitude, latitude, and equal to

289
00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:47.423
location.coordinates.

290
00:15:49.364 --> 00:15:54.301
Remember that this here is an array of longitude

291
00:15:54.301 --> 00:15:55.990
and latitude forced.

292
00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:59.471
That's exactly what Mapbox expects.

293
00:15:59.471 --> 00:16:02.540
Just to make sure you really understand,

294
00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:04.633
let's take a look at the tours.

295
00:16:05.719 --> 00:16:09.670
Again, each location has these coordinates property,

296
00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:12.693
and so that's where we now are reading the coordinates from.

297
00:16:13.915 --> 00:16:16.323
Location.coordinates.

298
00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:23.040
And then, finally, add to and then our map variable.

299
00:16:25.070 --> 00:16:28.850
So this map here is this map variable where we

300
00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:33.093
created our new Mapbox.map right in the beginning.

301
00:16:34.507 --> 00:16:38.320
And now, all we need to do to finish,

302
00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:40.463
is to actually extend our bounds.

303
00:16:41.490 --> 00:16:46.490
So bounds.extend and also with locations, or actually "loc",

304
00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:52.033
which is the current location.coordinates.

305
00:16:56.310 --> 00:16:59.720
This first part here actually adds the marker,

306
00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:00.950
or it creates,

307
00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:03.120
let's actually make it even more specific,

308
00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:04.310
create marker

309
00:17:08.550 --> 00:17:09.910
then add the marker

310
00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:15.540
and then here, extend the map bounds

311
00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:21.653
to include the current location.

312
00:17:22.624 --> 00:17:25.410
But that is still not enough,

313
00:17:25.410 --> 00:17:27.850
because now we also make it so that the map

314
00:17:27.850 --> 00:17:29.560
actually fits the bounds.

315
00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:34.560
So map.fit, no not find, but fit bounds,

316
00:17:39.310 --> 00:17:41.743
and then of course our bounds object.

317
00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:43.473
Whew.

318
00:17:43.473 --> 00:17:48.473
So, a lot of work just for putting some markers on the map.

319
00:17:48.530 --> 00:17:50.829
But, again, I find it really pleasant

320
00:17:50.829 --> 00:17:52.533
to work with this library.

321
00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:55.800
And let's now actually take a look

322
00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:58.450
and I'm not really sure if everything went well here.

323
00:18:00.430 --> 00:18:02.300
And actually, it didn't,

324
00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:05.264
so our maps are not really anywhere to be found,

325
00:18:05.264 --> 00:18:07.630
let's just zoom out a little bit to see if

326
00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:09.083
they are actually somewhere,

327
00:18:10.049 --> 00:18:11.253
and they are not.

328
00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:15.220
Let's take a look at our console,

329
00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:17.883
and indeed there is some kind of error.

330
00:18:18.910 --> 00:18:23.250
So lat, longitude bounds is not a constructor,

331
00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:26.150
and indeed it is the other way around.

332
00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:28.750
So again, Mapbox, just like MongoDB,

333
00:18:28.750 --> 00:18:31.350
expects coordinates to be longitude first,

334
00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:32.900
and then latitude.

335
00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:34.314
That's what we have

336
00:18:34.314 --> 00:18:36.420
here in this name,

337
00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:38.350
and so here it should be the same.

338
00:18:38.350 --> 00:18:42.813
So longitude, latitude.

339
00:18:44.616 --> 00:18:47.193
Let's try that again here.

340
00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:51.360
Ahh, now that works.

341
00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:52.900
Very nice.

342
00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:54.660
You saw that nice zoom.

343
00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:57.290
That's what the fit bounds method does.

344
00:18:57.290 --> 00:19:00.370
So it moves and zooms the map right to the bounds

345
00:19:00.370 --> 00:19:03.000
to actually fit our markers.

346
00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.180
Now, you see that we have this kind of other elements here

347
00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:08.943
overlapping our map.

348
00:19:08.943 --> 00:19:11.740
And so that's because of this design that I created

349
00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:14.470
with these edges here.

350
00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:16.490
But that's no problem because we can actually

351
00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:20.323
manually specify some padding to these bounds.

352
00:19:21.290 --> 00:19:23.860
We can pass in an object here,

353
00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:27.363
and so let's say top 200 pixels,

354
00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:32.830
bottom also 200 pixels,

355
00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:35.273
and then left and right 100 pixels.

356
00:19:42.561 --> 00:19:45.100
And we don't have to specify the pixels here,

357
00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:47.883
I guess that's just me writing so much CSS.

358
00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:52.053
Let's try that again.

359
00:19:53.635 --> 00:19:55.440
Oh, nice zoom animation,

360
00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:58.023
but that didn't really respect our settings.

361
00:19:59.110 --> 00:20:02.850
And actually, that's because this is not correct.

362
00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:05.180
So, we should instead create an object,

363
00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:08.150
and then in there we need to specify the padding property,

364
00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:09.673
which then has all of this.

365
00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:11.770
So let's do that.

366
00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:14.963
Padding.

367
00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:18.013
And now,

368
00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:20.913
cut this and put it there.

369
00:20:23.970 --> 00:20:25.113
Give it a save here.

370
00:20:27.790 --> 00:20:28.883
One more time.

371
00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:34.310
Man, something is still wrong here.

372
00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:35.840
What's that?

373
00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:39.560
Ahh, and of course this code should not be here.

374
00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:43.913
It's not in the extend, it is indeed here in fit bounds.

375
00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:47.633
So this is actually where it makes sense to be.

376
00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:57.333
Let's fix this code here, and now that makes sense.

377
00:20:59.144 --> 00:21:00.890
Of course it needs to be in the fit bounds,

378
00:21:00.890 --> 00:21:03.460
which is in the end, the function who executes

379
00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:05.750
the moving and the zooming.

380
00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:07.430
That's where the padding should be,

381
00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:10.400
and we could specify a bunch of other options.

382
00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:12.320
And again, if you're interested in that,

383
00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:14.713
just go check out the documentation.

384
00:21:15.810 --> 00:21:17.680
So a third try here,

385
00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:19.730
let's hope this time I got it right,

386
00:21:19.730 --> 00:21:23.520
ahh, and yes, that looks a lot better.

387
00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:26.980
But, there is still some stuff we can improve here,

388
00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:29.680
because right now we cannot even know

389
00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:31.670
what each of these locations is.

390
00:21:31.670 --> 00:21:35.290
And so we actually want kind of a pop-up here,

391
00:21:35.290 --> 00:21:38.373
which then displays information about the location.

392
00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:45.043
Not only the marker, but we also want to add a pop-up.

393
00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:52.630
And so that's a bit similar to actually adding the marker,

394
00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:57.133
so we say new Mapbox GL.popup.

395
00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:02.300
Then, just like before, we specify the coordinates

396
00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:03.623
of that pop-up.

397
00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:07.523
So that one right here.

398
00:22:08.610 --> 00:22:11.900
Then we also need to define the html for this pop-up,

399
00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:14.990
and I'm gonna do that now using the set html method,

400
00:22:14.990 --> 00:22:17.730
because that then will allow me to add some content

401
00:22:17.730 --> 00:22:19.950
right into that html,

402
00:22:19.950 --> 00:22:24.353
so set html, and then a template string here.

403
00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:28.030
I want this to be a paragraph,

404
00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:30.760
and the information that I want to display here is

405
00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:33.630
the day at which we're going to be at this location,

406
00:22:33.630 --> 00:22:36.250
and then the name of the location.

407
00:22:36.250 --> 00:22:39.730
So basically, I want to display the day,

408
00:22:39.730 --> 00:22:43.300
so that's why we created these day properties here,

409
00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:44.753
and then the description.

410
00:22:50.170 --> 00:22:54.520
Day, and then location, remember which is the current

411
00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:56.623
location indie for each loop,

412
00:22:57.860 --> 00:22:58.853
and then day,

413
00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:03.543
location.description.

414
00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:07.980
Give it a save here,

415
00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:10.210
that looks a lot nicer now.

416
00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:14.010
And then, just like with the other one, we also need to

417
00:23:14.010 --> 00:23:19.010
do add to, and then our map variable.

418
00:23:22.130 --> 00:23:24.380
And this will not look perfect, because we need to

419
00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:26.730
specify some options, but I still wanted to

420
00:23:26.730 --> 00:23:29.083
show you the result at this point.

421
00:23:32.070 --> 00:23:35.100
And so, you see that they actually overlap

422
00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:36.453
the markers now.

423
00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:41.083
We can actually fix that using an offset property.

424
00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:46.883
We pass that options right here into the new pop-up.

425
00:23:48.396 --> 00:23:49.770
We say

426
00:23:51.390 --> 00:23:54.940
offset of 30 pixels.

427
00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:57.081
And I also noticed that we have a bit too much

428
00:23:57.081 --> 00:23:59.840
padding at the bottom,

429
00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:04.840
so let's reduce that to 150 and do this again.

430
00:24:09.610 --> 00:24:13.190
And so, this looks pretty nice I think.

431
00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:15.750
So whoever now takes a look at our page,

432
00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:18.609
can very quickly see what kind of itinerary

433
00:24:18.609 --> 00:24:21.533
will be on this tour.

434
00:24:21.533 --> 00:24:23.740
And if there's too much information,

435
00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:26.423
we can also close up these pop-ups.

436
00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:30.700
And we could really add all kinds of stuff to this map.

437
00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:33.440
For example, we could create this lines

438
00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:35.250
here between these points,

439
00:24:35.250 --> 00:24:38.570
and join them together, like a green line here or something.

440
00:24:38.570 --> 00:24:41.096
Or we could also display the real route

441
00:24:41.096 --> 00:24:42.820
from one point to the other

442
00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:45.350
by using basically directions,

443
00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:47.610
but let's keep it simple here.

444
00:24:47.610 --> 00:24:49.990
The only thing that is left to do here for me,

445
00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:53.430
is to actually disable the zoom functionality.

446
00:24:53.430 --> 00:24:55.320
Because right now, let's say that we are

447
00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:57.230
zooming on this page,

448
00:24:57.230 --> 00:24:59.400
or actually if we're scrolling on this page,

449
00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:01.450
and so once we reach this here,

450
00:25:01.450 --> 00:25:03.740
and then keep scrolling here,

451
00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:08.740
then we scroll the map instead of the page.

452
00:25:09.034 --> 00:25:12.060
That's not a good user experience,

453
00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:13.673
and so all we need to do now

454
00:25:13.673 --> 00:25:17.110
is to basically disable the scrolling functionality

455
00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:18.410
on this map.

456
00:25:18.410 --> 00:25:22.880
We will still allow people to pan around like this,

457
00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:24.883
but zooming is going to be disabled.

458
00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:29.463
Let's go here to our map and add that.

459
00:25:30.743 --> 00:25:33.760
And we're not using interactive defaults,

460
00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:35.970
because then we could not even pan the map.

461
00:25:35.970 --> 00:25:39.317
But again, that should at least be allowed.

462
00:25:39.317 --> 00:25:43.680
The option that I'm setting here is scroll zoom false.

463
00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:49.202
And again, for all the possible options

464
00:25:49.202 --> 00:25:50.888
that you could set here,

465
00:25:50.888 --> 00:25:55.190
please just go ahead and take a look at the reference.

466
00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:58.730
And so now, when we put our mouse here and scroll,

467
00:25:58.730 --> 00:26:01.463
it doesn't change the zoom level.

468
00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:04.530
Perfect.

469
00:26:04.530 --> 00:26:09.060
We can still pan, and so I think it looks really nice now.

470
00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:12.083
Let's test this out in another one.

471
00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:14.653
Let's say here the forest hiker.

472
00:26:17.290 --> 00:26:19.450
And so, that still works.

473
00:26:19.450 --> 00:26:22.130
And these here are kind of overlapping,

474
00:26:22.130 --> 00:26:25.553
but no problem, we can always close them if we want.

475
00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:30.713
Let's take a look here for example, sea explorer.

476
00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:33.440
And if we're quick enough,

477
00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:35.231
we can even see the zoom animation

478
00:26:35.231 --> 00:26:38.100
moving the map to that location.

479
00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:39.890
Okay, perfect.

480
00:26:39.890 --> 00:26:42.680
So I hope you were able to really follow along

481
00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:46.670
this example with everything we did in Mapbox.

482
00:26:46.670 --> 00:26:49.060
Now in case that anything didn't work,

483
00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:50.330
please make sure that you're using

484
00:26:50.330 --> 00:26:51.863
a similar version to mine,

485
00:26:52.870 --> 00:26:56.500
so what I mean is a similar version of the Mapbox library.

486
00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:59.403
Which in my case here is version 0.54.

487
00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:04.363
Yours should probably not be 1.something.

488
00:27:05.250 --> 00:27:06.600
So if you're watching this video a

489
00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:10.430
long time after this recording and have a V1 here,

490
00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:14.891
then please go ahead and change that to 0.something,

491
00:27:14.891 --> 00:27:18.213
so that there are basically no breaking changes there.

492
00:27:19.242 --> 00:27:24.242
Anyway, with that, we actually wrap up our tour page,

493
00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:27.140
and so we no longer need any of this,

494
00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:30.140
the map is also there,

495
00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:34.740
and so, this part of the website is actually finished.

496
00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:35.573
Awesome.

497
00:27:35.573 --> 00:27:38.660
Congratulations for making that a reality,

498
00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:42.200
for really starting to build this beautiful website

499
00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:44.200
using all these amazing technologies

500
00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:45.663
that you've learned so far.
