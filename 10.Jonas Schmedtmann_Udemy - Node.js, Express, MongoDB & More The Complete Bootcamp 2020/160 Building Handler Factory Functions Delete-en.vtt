<v Instructor>In this video,</v>

2
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.090
we're gonna be building a handler factory function

3
00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:07.460
in order to delete review documents,

4
00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:10.640
but also documents from all the other collections,

5
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.713
all with one simple function.

6
00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.970
So, as I mentioned right at the beginning of this section,

7
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.540
adding very similar handlers to all of our controllers

8
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.010
will create a lot of duplicate code, right?

9
00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:26.880
Because all these update handlers,

10
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.580
or all these delete handlers,

11
00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.420
or all these create handlers,

12
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.640
they really all just look basically the same, right?

13
00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.070
Also, imagine that we wanted to change

14
00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.010
like some https status code or status message.

15
00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.380
Then we would have to go into each and every controller

16
00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.900
and then change all the handlers in there.

17
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.470
And so, instead of manually writing all these handlers,

18
00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.410
why not simply create a factory function

19
00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.830
that's gonna return these handlers for us?

20
00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:57.710
So, a factory function is exactly that.

21
00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.690
It's a function that returns another function,

22
00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.950
and in this case our handler function.

23
00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:06.230
So, for deleting, for creating, for updating,

24
00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:08.780
and also for reading resources.

25
00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.400
Okay and I know that this whole concept can be a bit complex

26
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.980
to wrap your head around,

27
00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:16.930
and that's the reason why I left this

28
00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.350
for the later part of this course.

29
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.460
But now, I believe that you're actually ready

30
00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.580
to implement this kinda stuff.

31
00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.900
So this kind of logic is what every advanced

32
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.800
JavaScript developer should be able to implement,

33
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.770
and so again I believe that at this point in the course

34
00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.860
you're really ready to start using advanced concept

35
00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.570
like this, all right.

36
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.510
But enough talk, let me now show you how it actually works

37
00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.860
by using the delete handler as a first example.

38
00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.540
And so actually we have one in the tour controller,

39
00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.063
and so let's go ahead and copy that one,

40
00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:52.763
so delete tour.

41
00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.490
Okay, so I copied it basically

42
00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.283
as a template for us to follow.

43
00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.770
So let's create a new file, and I'm going to do that

44
00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:03.883
in the controllers.

45
00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:05.743
All right,

46
00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:08.310
so handler...

47
00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:11.883
factory.js.

48
00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.690
And I'm doing this is the controllers folder,

49
00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.060
well because the functions that we're gonna write here

50
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.070
will basically return controllers.

51
00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:21.860
And so for me it makes a lot of sense

52
00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.010
that you put them here.

53
00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.300
So let's just copy this part here,

54
00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.640
just to keep it as a reference.

55
00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.010
So again the goal here is to basically create a function,

56
00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.580
which will then return a function

57
00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.750
that looks like this one here.

58
00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.870
But of course not only for the tour,

59
00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.670
but for every single model that we have in our application

60
00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.840
and that we might have in the future.

61
00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.270
So this function needs to be prepared for that,

62
00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.150
and so what that means is that inside the factory function,

63
00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.843
we will pass in the model, all right.

64
00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.937
So let's call this one deleteOne.

65
00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:00.960
And it's called like this, again,

66
00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.830
because this function is not only going

67
00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:04.610
to work to delete tours,

68
00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.580
but also to delete reviews and users

69
00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.630
and in the future some other documents

70
00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:10.923
that we might also have.

71
00:03:12.582 --> 00:03:14.750
So as I was saying in the beginning,

72
00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.680
we will pass the model into this function.

73
00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.930
So we pass the model and then we create a new function,

74
00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.620
and that function will right away

75
00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.438
then return our async function,

76
00:03:26.438 --> 00:03:27.271
so basically all of this or async handler function.

77
00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.310
Okay, and so now all we need to do is to actually change

78
00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.663
from the specific tool model to the more generic model.

79
00:03:43.685 --> 00:03:48.240
Then here we will also change this from tour to the document

80
00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.890
because again, we will not know what kinda document is this.

81
00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.810
So this function will not really know if it is a tour,

82
00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.963
or if it is a review, or a user.

83
00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.063
And so we need to take the tour out of all of this,

84
00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.550
and that's actually it.

85
00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:07.870
So this basically the generalization

86
00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.710
of this specific function, which worked only for tours,

87
00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:14.263
and now this new one works for every model.

88
00:04:16.586 --> 00:04:20.420
What we also need to do here is to import this catchAsync

89
00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:21.793
and also this AppError.

90
00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.290
So catchAsync...

91
00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:35.023
and I believe it's in the utilities folder.

92
00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:40.213
And then, not AppError but catchAsync.

93
00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.030
Then duplicate this here,

94
00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:51.243
AppError, and this here is uppercase.

95
00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.840
Give it a save, and we're now ready

96
00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.323
to actually test this out.

97
00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.490
So this is how it's going to work,

98
00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:05.333
first of all we need to import that handler factory.

99
00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:07.843
And so let's say,

100
00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:12.560
and I'm simply going to call it factory here.

101
00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:19.730
So require, and it's in the same folder,

102
00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:21.113
so handler factory.

103
00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:28.110
All right and so let's comment this one here out,

104
00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:29.510
or actually not all of this.

105
00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:34.343
Yeah or actually we can comment it out,

106
00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.917
and so the new exports.deletes tour will be...

107
00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:50.670
factory.deleteOne and then pass in the model,

108
00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:52.410
which is tour.

109
00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:55.053
And that's it, that's all we need to do.

110
00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.650
So just to recap very quickly here,

111
00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:01.450
so we call this deleteOne function,

112
00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:03.550
then in there we pass the model,

113
00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:06.520
and so what's going to happen is that this function

114
00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:09.433
will then right away return this handler function

115
00:06:09.433 --> 00:06:10.773
that we had before.

116
00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:15.070
Simply the specific model, which before was the tour,

117
00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:17.200
is now going to be replaced with the one

118
00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:18.923
that we passed into the function.

119
00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:23.160
And by the way this works because of JavaScript closures,

120
00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.690
which is just a fancy way of saying

121
00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:28.670
that this inner function here will get access

122
00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:30.820
to the variables of the outer function

123
00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:33.643
even after the outer has already returned.

124
00:06:34.992 --> 00:06:37.370
So calling this function here

125
00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:39.660
will then return another function,

126
00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:43.000
which will then sit here and wait until it is finally called

127
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.260
as soon as we hit the corresponding route.

128
00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.343
And so let's now try exactly that.

129
00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:50.873
So delete tour,

130
00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:54.773
okay, and let's choose a tour

131
00:06:54.773 --> 00:06:57.580
that we don't really need here for now.

132
00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:59.130
So let's say...

133
00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:01.970
now let's say here The Snow Adventurer

134
00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:03.970
'cause it also doesn't have any reviews.

135
00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:10.133
So let's send that,

136
00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:14.350
oh and now we don't have permission to preform the action,

137
00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:17.633
and that's because we're not logged in as an admin.

138
00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:20.413
So let's try that,

139
00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:25.913
and so this is the admin that we need to be logged in.

140
00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:28.740
Okay, so that's done.

141
00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:33.300
And so now this should work, and indeed it did work.

142
00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:36.300
And so that's proof that our factory function

143
00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:37.883
is really doing it's job.

144
00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:41.820
Okay 'cause if you now come back here,

145
00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:46.530
we had 10 results and so now we should only get nine,

146
00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:47.513
so perfect.

147
00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:51.510
And now the goal is to be able to use this

148
00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:53.373
in each and every single controller.

149
00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:57.230
So let's copy this here

150
00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:00.483
and go to the reviews.

151
00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:03.670
Oh and of course we need it up here,

152
00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:08.090
right in the beginning, now right,

153
00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:12.320
and so now export.deleteReview

154
00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:18.893
is equal to factory.deleteOne

155
00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:24.680
with the review model.

156
00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:26.710
And that's it, that's all we need to do

157
00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:29.890
in order to implement the delete handler.

158
00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:33.293
Now of course we also need to specify the route handler.

159
00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:39.000
Now of course we need to specify the route itself,

160
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.243
and so let's do that here as well.

161
00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:47.450
So router.route

162
00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:52.553
because here we actually need the ID parameter.

163
00:08:55.152 --> 00:09:00.053
And now delete is simply reviewController.deleteReview,

164
00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:05.970
and I'm not messing with the permission here,

165
00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:07.910
neither with authentication

166
00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:10.190
because for now I just want to make this work

167
00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:13.053
and worry about that stuff a bit later in this section.

168
00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:19.350
Okay, so let's close this stuff up here.

169
00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:23.623
So get all reviews,

170
00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:27.113
all right,

171
00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:33.430
let's save this and this one as well.

172
00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:35.890
So that now we can start with a blank sheet here

173
00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:39.710
and let's just start by getting all reviews,

174
00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:41.933
so that we can now delete one.

175
00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:46.463
And so let's delete, well just this one.

176
00:09:52.663 --> 00:09:55.830
Okay, now we also need of course this,

177
00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:03.563
and then the delete http method.

178
00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:06.900
We need no authorization at this point,

179
00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:08.840
so let's just send it.

180
00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:11.980
And indeed no content, so 204.

181
00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:14.360
And if we now get all the reviews,

182
00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:16.883
then we should be back to having just three.

183
00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:22.730
Yep, that works and so let's move on to the next one.

184
00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:26.203
Okay so reviews, reviews.

185
00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:32.220
Let's get this line of code here and now finally add it

186
00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:34.183
to the user controller as well.

187
00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:42.700
All right, and of course all of this,

188
00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:45.450
I understand it's a bit confusing now messing

189
00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:47.200
with all of these different files,

190
00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:50.190
but we just need to do it once and then we're done

191
00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:51.533
with all that confusion.

192
00:10:52.636 --> 00:10:55.033
So here we already had the export.deleteUser,

193
00:10:55.986 --> 00:11:00.845
now all we need to do is to then call our factory function,

194
00:11:00.845 --> 00:11:03.428
so deleteOne and then the user.

195
00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:09.140
Now only the administrator should later be able

196
00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:12.760
to actually delete users because remember that

197
00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:14.750
when the user deletes himself,

198
00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:17.750
then they will not actually get deleted

199
00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:20.350
but only active will be set to false.

200
00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:22.400
But the administrator on the other hand

201
00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:25.710
is really gonna be able to delete the user effectively

202
00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:26.940
from the database.

203
00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:28.550
But again, we're going to worry

204
00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:31.023
about that permission stuff a bit later.

205
00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:35.487
For now, let's check in the userRoutes

206
00:11:37.057 --> 00:11:39.210
if the route is actually implemented,

207
00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:41.560
and yeah it is down here.

208
00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:43.730
And so since we now implemented this,

209
00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:47.653
let's also test it here again also on Postman.

210
00:11:49.290 --> 00:11:50.983
So first let's save this one.

211
00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:55.360
So...

212
00:11:56.210 --> 00:11:59.373
delete review,

213
00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:07.000
and now let's simply copy this

214
00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:10.910
into yet another route.

215
00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:13.063
So delete and then one user,

216
00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:16.690
but I'm actually not really going to do it now.

217
00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:22.253
All I want is to just get some random ID.

218
00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:26.703
Or actually let's just create a new user,

219
00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:31.323
so basically sign up, and then delete that one right away.

220
00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:35.563
So hello, like this.

221
00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:43.360
Get all users, and then it's this guy here.

222
00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:46.963
And so let's delete him right away,

223
00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:51.560
so we send, we get 204 no content.

224
00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:53.833
And of course, now he should be gone.

225
00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:56.740
Now if we try to see her again,

226
00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:58.680
so basically trying to delete a user

227
00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:01.320
that is no longer there, we should get an error.

228
00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:04.673
So let's take a look, and indeed no document found

229
00:13:04.673 --> 00:13:06.330
with that ID.

230
00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:09.203
And so this means that in our factory function,

231
00:13:10.570 --> 00:13:15.550
so right here, all of this the AppError and the catchAsync,

232
00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:17.240
all of that is still intact.

233
00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:20.490
So everything still works just the same as before.

234
00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:23.283
Now so that was also important to test here.

235
00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:27.860
Let's just quickly save this here as well,

236
00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:31.660
so each and every single endpoint that we're implementing,

237
00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:33.810
I'm also adding it here into Postman

238
00:13:33.810 --> 00:13:36.890
because a bit later we will then actually be able

239
00:13:36.890 --> 00:13:39.420
to actually create some API documentation

240
00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:43.970
based on all of this that we have saved here in Postman.

241
00:13:43.970 --> 00:13:47.713
So that's yet another handy feature of this application.

242
00:13:50.253 --> 00:13:51.960
So we have delete the current user,

243
00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:54.520
and again that's different from just deleting the user

244
00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:56.800
because this one here is for administration

245
00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:59.803
and this one is for the currently logged in user,

246
00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:01.963
so very different.

247
00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:06.750
Okay, so this was our first factory function

248
00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:09.660
only for deleting and only for you to understand

249
00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:11.290
the concept itself.

250
00:14:11.290 --> 00:14:13.740
Next up, we're then gonna implement factory functions

251
00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:16.293
for updating and for creating documents.
