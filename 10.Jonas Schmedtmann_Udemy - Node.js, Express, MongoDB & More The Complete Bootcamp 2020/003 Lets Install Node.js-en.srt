1
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:03,810
<v Instructor>Before we can get started with this course,</v>

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:06,410
we actually need to install Node.js

3
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:09,020
on our local development computer.

4
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:12,270
And this process is actually exactly the same

5
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:14,370
for all operation systems.

6
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:17,210
So in this video, I will use Mac OS,

7
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:21,100
but on Windows or Linux, it's really just the same.

8
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:23,270
Now installing other technologies

9
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:25,250
like the MongoDB database,

10
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:27,290
works very differently on Windows.

11
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:30,120
And so by then, I will have one video for Mac

12
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:33,010
and one for Windows, all right?

13
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:36,683
Anyway, let's now go add and install Node.js.

14
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:42,210
So in your web browser, head over to nodejs.org,

15
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:45,310
and then on the website, you should see these two

16
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:48,440
big green buttons here to download Node.js

17
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:51,070
for your current operating system.

18
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:54,110
So up here, you should see automatically selected

19
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:56,570
the OS that you're currently running.

20
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:59,670
And if not, you can just head over here to DOWNLOADS

21
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:03,630
and then select your operation system from there, okay?

22
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:06,660
Then here, you can select which Node.js version

23
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:08,490
you would like to install.

24
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:13,120
So, right now, the long term support version is version 10,

25
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,520
and so that's actually the one

26
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,270
that I'm using in this course.

27
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:18,080
But right now, the current version,

28
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,410
so the newest one basically, is 12, okay?

29
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:23,950
But Node just recommends for most users

30
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:26,010
the Long-Term Support version

31
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:29,220
and also by the time I started recording this course,

32
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,950
version 10 was actually the current one.

33
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:35,400
And so therefore, in this course, we're using version 10

34
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,610
and so you can go ahead

35
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:39,930
and download this version now as well, all right?

36
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:42,690
Now if you're watching this video in the far future,

37
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:47,120
then another version might already be here, the LTS version.

38
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:50,640
So let's actually take a look here at the schedule.

39
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,550
And so you see that they actually have a timeline here

40
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:55,740
for all the versions in the future.

41
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,730
So right now version 10 is the active version,

42
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:02,950
but if you're like watching this video for example in 2021,

43
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:07,400
well then you should probably go with Node.js 14, okay?

44
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,540
Now, what's also important to note here

45
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:12,440
is that you should only use the even version numbers

46
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,530
for a production project.

47
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:19,530
So that's 10, 11, 14, and so on and so forth.

48
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,190
And in case you're worrying that I'm using an old version

49
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:25,790
in this course, in case you're watching this

50
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:28,050
in the far future, then let me tell you

51
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:30,520
that Node actually doesn't change that much,

52
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,230
in terms of what we're gonna do here in this course,

53
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:36,120
from one version to the other, okay?

54
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,120
So probably, you will be perfectly fine

55
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,030
by using Node 12 or Node 14.

56
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:45,110
And everything will be working in the exact same way, okay?

57
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:47,870
And only in case you run in any problem,

58
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:50,730
you can then go ahead and install Node 10

59
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:54,480
and see if your problem disappears by doing that, okay?

60
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,810
So again, don't worry all too much

61
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:59,250
about outdated versions here.

62
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:00,370
All right?

63
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:04,180
Anyway, let's now actually download this version 10 here

64
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:07,020
so that I can take you here through the process.

65
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:12,020
So once that arrives, just open it, and then as always,

66
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:15,420
just click Continue everywhere.

67
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:16,433
You must agree.

68
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:20,703
And then install it.

69
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,793
Okay.

70
00:03:23,793 --> 00:03:26,740
And with this, you should now have Node.js installed

71
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,450
on your local computer.

72
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:31,513
Now just to test it, let's close the window here.

73
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:34,120
All right.

74
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,450
And then open up your terminal, okay?

75
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:40,970
So, I'm using Terminal.app on Mac OS

76
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:43,500
and on Windows, you can use the Command Prompt

77
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,800
or the PowerShell.

78
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,560
Both work just fine, okay?

79
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,790
So in order to test if we have Node.js installed,

80
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:55,570
just write node and then -v, which stands for version.

81
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:56,760
Hit Return.

82
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,320
And so that should then give you the version number

83
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,320
of your current installation.

84
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:04,910
And in case you see an error here, then you should probably

85
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:07,670
try to reinstall Node.js.

86
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:09,890
Now, if you're taking this course,

87
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:13,530
I'm assuming that you're already familiar with the basic use

88
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:16,130
of the Terminal, or of the command line.

89
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:19,600
So you should know basic commands, like ls,

90
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,360
to take a look at all the files in a current directory.

91
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,760
On Windows, that's actually D-I-R,

92
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,250
so which stands for directory, and again,

93
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:31,320
that will give you a list of all the files or folders

94
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,580
in the current location, okay?

95
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:35,970
So in the Terminal, you're always in a location.

96
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:38,690
In my case, I'm currently in the Home folder.

97
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:40,680
And then you can basically move around

98
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,300
in your folder structure.

99
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,170
For example, if I wanted to move to my Desktop,

100
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:50,170
I could use cd Desktop, hit Return,

101
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:52,030
and now I'm in the Desktop.

102
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:53,923
Then I can go back with cd ..,

103
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:59,040
and so now I'm back here in this main folder.

104
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,280
And actually, we don't need to know much more

105
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,540
about the Terminal or the command line, okay?

106
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:08,010
So we won't use much more than what I just showed you

107
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:09,800
in this two minutes.

108
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,690
Great.

109
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:13,340
So now that you have Node.js installed

110
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:14,870
on your development computer,

111
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,500
we are ready to move on.

112
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,603
And so I hope to see you soon in the next video.
