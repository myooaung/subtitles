00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:03.310
<v Instructor>Let's now do the first part</v>

2
00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:06.860
of building the dynamic node farm website

3
00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:08.830
with just building the templates

4
00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:11.083
that will hold the actual data.

5
00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:15.590
And remember that our goal is to build this kind

6
00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:19.260
of dynamic website where we have an overview

7
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.130
where we have all the products,

8
00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.060
and then each product has its detail page

9
00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.700
just like I showed you before.

10
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.780
And this data here is of course read from the json file,

11
00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:32.660
so if we change the json file, for example,

12
00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.140
deleting one of these products then reloading this page,

13
00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.920
then that product should be gone from here.

14
00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.340
Or if we changed some of this data here or the name,

15
00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.600
well, then, that should update here on the site.

16
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.940
Again because it's a dynamic website

17
00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.073
built from the data that's in the json file.

18
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:52.830
So as I mentioned,

19
00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:55.540
the first step is to actually build these templates,

20
00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.930
one for this overview page,

21
00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.960
and one for the product detail page.

22
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.773
And we're gonna start with the detail page,

23
00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:06.540
and I'm gonna build these templates

24
00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.250
based on these data web pages that we have here

25
00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.220
in the templates folder.

26
00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.850
So let's take a look at them.

27
00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.030
So we have overview and product, and again,

28
00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.610
we're gonna start with the product.html.

29
00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.950
So we have here the product name then this image here

30
00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.923
which is actually an emoji, but that doesn't really matter.

31
00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.210
So instead of having to request the real images

32
00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.000
for all of these different products,

33
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.590
I chose to just go with emojis.

34
00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.210
That's much easier.

35
00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.860
The same actually for the style.

36
00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.040
So I have all the CSS style inlined into the html pages

37
00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.470
so that we don't have to make multiple requests

38
00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.500
to getting these different data, right?

39
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:48.450
Because actually,

40
00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.144
each different file will trigger a different request, okay?

41
00:01:53.144 --> 00:01:55.860
Remember before where we had the request

42
00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.090
for the five icon, right?

43
00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.160
So we saw one request for the root, so for the main page,

44
00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.640
and then one request for that image, and what that means

45
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.920
is that each asset,

46
00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.600
so each piece that is part of the website,

47
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.670
will get its own request,

48
00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.540
and we will then have to handle that,

49
00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:14.970
and we don't want to do that,

50
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.533
and so I simply inlined the style into these html pages.

51
00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.560
All right, so here's a bunch of style, style, style,

52
00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:29.073
and then here we have the,

53
00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.053
well, the name of the product somewhere.

54
00:02:33.053 --> 00:02:35.090
Oh yeah, here, so it's the name of the product.

55
00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.270
Here is the product image, which again is just an emoji,

56
00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.930
but it comes here from this image field.

57
00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.693
So we have this field called image.

58
00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:47.630
Right?

59
00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:51.780
Then we have where it comes from, some of the ingredients,

60
00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.257
and price, and also the description down here, okay?

61
00:02:56.257 --> 00:02:59.000
But again, all of this comes from these different fields.

62
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.310
So let's take a look at the fields we have.

63
00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:06.037
So product name, image, from, nutrients, quantity, price,

64
00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.323
whether it's organic or not, and the description.

65
00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.890
So what we're gonna do now is to basically replace

66
00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.460
all of these pieces that we want to add dynamically

67
00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:21.260
with a placeholder, and we're then later

68
00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.320
with our code replace that placeholder

69
00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.750
with the real piece of data, okay?

70
00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.700
So let's start here with the product name,

71
00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.887
and so I'm gonna go ahead and delete that

72
00:03:32.887 --> 00:03:35.330
and then put a placeholder here.

73
00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.560
And I can do anything that I want for a placeholder.

74
00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.730
I just like to go in this case with something like this.

75
00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:43.563
So...

76
00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.930
Product name, and then percentage and then the curly braces.

77
00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:53.740
So again, this could be anything that we wanted,

78
00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:55.270
but we want to find something

79
00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:57.660
that is probably not on the page

80
00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.620
so that we don't replace anything wrong

81
00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:05.120
so anything that we actually don't want to replace, okay?

82
00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.570
And I could put something like this here, okay?

83
00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:12.260
And then replace all of that, but I think, like this,

84
00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.383
it looks nice, and it's easy to recognize.

85
00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:19.550
And so all we have to do is to go ahead and

86
00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:23.630
put this all over here,

87
00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:28.050
and I'm then going to replace, of course, these names.

88
00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:29.963
So here we have the nutrients.

89
00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:35.133
Here we have the quantity.

90
00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.293
And here I have the price.

91
00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:43.673
Down here we have the price again, you see.

92
00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:48.380
And the price is just the number, okay?

93
00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:51.280
The euro sign here just stays right there

94
00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.630
because the price that we have is actually just a number.

95
00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:59.470
Let's take a look at that right here in json.

96
00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:02.840
So we have just 6.50 but not the currency.

97
00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:07.240
And actually the same here, so let's grab that

98
00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.510
and copy it here very quick, and yeah,

99
00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:12.960
actually, I forgot to replace this one,

100
00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.763
so this is the from.

101
00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:21.440
And let's actually write out from, not in uppercase,

102
00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.850
so that this text makes a bit more sense.

103
00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:28.320
So for example, from Portugal or from Spain or whatever.

104
00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:29.643
Oh, what's that here?

105
00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:35.380
Okay, I guess I just wrote in the middle of product name.

106
00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:36.363
So nutrients.

107
00:05:39.861 --> 00:05:40.694
Okay.

108
00:05:40.694 --> 00:05:44.030
Oh, and down here we have, of course, the description,

109
00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:45.320
so let's replace that as well.

110
00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:49.020
Oh, of course I need to get this one back

111
00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:50.820
and

112
00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:53.573
so description.

113
00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:58.963
Next up we have these images, so the avocado,

114
00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:03.050
and so I'm hitting a couple of command V's,

115
00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:07.060
pasting this here, and so I can edit these here

116
00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:08.363
all at the same time.

117
00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:16.660
Okay, then image and, oh, something here in the title.

118
00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:20.500
We also want to replace the image up here

119
00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.083
and the product name also.

120
00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:23.963
So.

121
00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:28.650
Product name here

122
00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:31.640
and here the image

123
00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:36.640
so that this one as well will get replaced dynamically.

124
00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.550
All right, now just one more thing

125
00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:42.563
which is a bit more complex.

126
00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:44.980
Where is it?

127
00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:46.290
All right, it's here.

128
00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:49.860
So some products are organic, and some are not.

129
00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:53.210
And so there is a class in the CSS that will get added

130
00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:58.200
to all of these elements when they are not organic, okay?

131
00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:00.430
So that is this class here.

132
00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:03.680
So when it's not organic, then it should not be displayed,

133
00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.383
so this organic badge here.

134
00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:08.930
And just to show you what I'm talking about,

135
00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:12.790
the organic badge is this thing here, okay?

136
00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:14.830
So we do not want to display that

137
00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:19.530
in case it is false in the json, so what we're gonna do here

138
00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:22.660
is to actually add another placeholder here

139
00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:25.433
or actually inside of the class,

140
00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:29.410
and so I'm gonna call this one not

141
00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:31.203
organic.

142
00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:34.280
And you will see why a bit later, okay?

143
00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:38.650
When we replace this, it will make a bit more sense to you.

144
00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:41.890
All right, so I think this one is done,

145
00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:45.313
and I simply overwrote everything that we had.

146
00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.180
So let me now just call this template

147
00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:53.110
product, okay?

148
00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:54.360
So this one is done.

149
00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:57.850
Let's move on to the next one, the overview.

150
00:07:57.850 --> 00:08:01.040
And this one is actually gonna be a bit different,

151
00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:03.053
and let me show you why that is.

152
00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:07.690
So again, we have all the SCC inlined here,

153
00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:10.510
and now we have this cards container,

154
00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:14.640
and then for each of the products, we have one card.

155
00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:19.373
So each of these cards here has this figure tag, right?

156
00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:23.050
Now we actually do not know how many

157
00:08:23.050 --> 00:08:27.280
of these cards will be here in this overview, right?

158
00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:30.200
Imagine we have 10 products in the json.

159
00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:32.660
Then we need 10 of these cards.

160
00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:34.920
But imagine that we only have one or two.

161
00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:39.340
Well then, we do not want all the 10 cards but only two.

162
00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:42.190
So how are we gonna do that?

163
00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:46.350
Well, we will actually create just another template

164
00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:49.180
where there's only one card in there,

165
00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:51.730
and we will then include one of these templates

166
00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:54.230
for each of the cards that we want,

167
00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:57.520
so each of the products in the json file.

168
00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:59.605
All right, make sense?

169
00:08:59.605 --> 00:09:02.693
So let's call this here the template overview.

170
00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:09.313
And I'm gonna go ahead and create the template card.

171
00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:18.690
So what I'm gonna do here is to now, as I mentioned,

172
00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:19.973
now it's back at the top,

173
00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:24.023
so I'm go ahead and grab one figure.

174
00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:26.153
That was too much.

175
00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:29.623
And paste it here.

176
00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:32.823
So bring this down a little bit.

177
00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:39.493
Okay, so each card now gets its own figure.

178
00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:44.280
Okay, and so now what I'm gonna do

179
00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:47.380
is to delete all of the cards from here

180
00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:53.283
and create a placeholder here as well.

181
00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:58.200
Product

182
00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:01.360
cards.

183
00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:02.430
Okay?

184
00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:04.970
So again, later on in our code,

185
00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:08.830
we will then create as many cards as we need here.

186
00:10:08.830 --> 00:10:10.890
For example, if we have five products,

187
00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:13.660
we create five cards like this.

188
00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:16.780
We will then put them together into one string

189
00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:20.090
and then replace product cards with that string

190
00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:24.320
which contains all of these different cards, all right?

191
00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:27.563
So actually, we are done with this one.

192
00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:29.703
Okay?

193
00:10:29.703 --> 00:10:31.440
Because most of the stuff happens

194
00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:34.780
inside of the template card.

195
00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:36.910
So nothing else to replace here.

196
00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:40.113
I'm just coming down here to copy this here,

197
00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:44.730
and now it's very simple for us

198
00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:48.190
to replace what we need here.

199
00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:52.373
So this here is the image, and we actually have it twice.

200
00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:56.893
Okay, that makes it look a bit nicer.

201
00:10:58.270 --> 00:11:03.227
Image, image, then here we have the product name, remember?

202
00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:07.990
Here in this place,

203
00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:12.670
we will have again the not organic placeholder,

204
00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:15.943
and again, this one will make more sense to you a bit later.

205
00:11:17.470 --> 00:11:21.143
More organic, then the quantity here.

206
00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:27.163
Then the price.

207
00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:34.070
So we need to also actually build the link here.

208
00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:36.290
So this one here, so the A element,

209
00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:39.460
in case you're not really familiar with html,

210
00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:42.093
the A element is for a link.

211
00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:47.073
So let me actually show it to you in a real working example.

212
00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:52.040
So when we hover here on this link,

213
00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:54.830
down there in the left bottom corner,

214
00:11:54.830 --> 00:11:59.000
so down here, you will see that it is slash product

215
00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.770
and then ID equals to zero.

216
00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:06.760
And this one is ID equals to one, ID equals two.

217
00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:09.480
Okay, and if we click on that, we see it actually here.

218
00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:13.440
So slash product and then ID equals to zero,

219
00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:18.440
and this ID here is exactly the ID that we have in the json.

220
00:12:19.970 --> 00:12:22.085
Okay, so this one here.

221
00:12:22.085 --> 00:12:25.900
So the avocado is one, the goat cheese has one.

222
00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:28.083
Sorry, the avocado has zero, of course.

223
00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:33.380
The broccoli has two and so on and so forth.

224
00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:36.463
And so here actually we need to build the link.

225
00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:42.113
So product, and of course, not in uppercase.

226
00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:46.370
So product, and the ID is

227
00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:51.360
ID.

228
00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:52.280
Okay?

229
00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:56.850
So then we have to replace this ID placeholder here

230
00:12:56.850 --> 00:12:58.250
with the correct number.

231
00:12:58.250 --> 00:13:02.430
So zero, one, two, three, four, five, and so on and so forth

232
00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:04.930
depending on how many products there are.

233
00:13:04.930 --> 00:13:09.510
So suppose that we have a cheese here, okay?

234
00:13:09.510 --> 00:13:11.050
Let's go back here.

235
00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:14.440
Well, then the image will be this here,

236
00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:18.463
the product name will be this, and the ID will be one.

237
00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:21.480
Okay, and so this here will then translate

238
00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:26.113
to ID equals to one and our handler here.

239
00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:30.950
So this server handler here will then take care

240
00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:35.950
of going to the right page when the product ID is one, okay?

241
00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:39.220
So that logic is not yet implemented, but of course,

242
00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:42.103
we're gonna do that in the next couple of lectures.

243
00:13:43.010 --> 00:13:47.456
So we have now the templates actually built,

244
00:13:47.456 --> 00:13:50.940
and so let's move on to the next video

245
00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:54.440
where we will actually start to fill out the templates

246
00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:57.073
and send back the final page to the browser.
