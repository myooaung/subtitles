<v ->Welcome back to yet another really exciting section,</v>

3
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:09,410
where we will finally connect a MongoDB database

4
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:11,040
with our application.

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,750
And to do so, we're gonna use the very popular

6
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:17,030
Mongoose library, which makes working with MongoDB

7
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:19,773
in Node.js, really, really easy.

8
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:23,990
So in this section, we're gonna take a deep dive

9
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:25,760
into the Mongoose library,

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,650
and really make our application

11
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:31,180
and API come to life with real data

12
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:33,640
coming from a real database.

13
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,320
So we're gonna talk about data models,

14
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,350
implement important API features,

15
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:41,010
add some data validation,

16
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:46,010
and also use the advanced MongoDB aggregation pipeline.

17
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:50,559
So, get ready now for a ton of great content coming up.
