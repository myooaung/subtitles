00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:02,310
<v Lecturer>Let's now learn</v>

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:05,453
how to serve static files with Express.

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,060
Now what do I actually mean with static files?

4
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:13,710
Well, it's the files that are sitting in our file system

5
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:16,810
that we currently cannot access using all routes.

6
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:20,160
So, for example, we have this overview.html file

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,850
here in our public folder.

8
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:25,000
But right now there's no way that we can access this

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,700
using a browser, right?

10
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,630
And the same for these image files that we have here,

11
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:32,500
or the CSS or the Javascript files.

12
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,770
So let me show that to you,

13
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:37,373
and let me actually use the browser this time.

14
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:41,060
For now I'm copying this URL here

15
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:42,700
just to show you that it's gonna work,

16
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:45,110
obviously also in the browser.

17
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:48,210
Okay, so this is our unformatted result here,

18
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:49,460
from the same route.

19
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:52,716
But let's say that we actually want to access that HTML file

20
00:00:52,716 --> 00:00:54,570
that I was just talking about.

21
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:56,700
So we can, of course, not just write

22
00:00:57,770 --> 00:00:59,943
public and then, for example,

23
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:03,670
overview.html, right?

24
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:06,197
There's no way we can access this right now.

25
00:01:06,197 --> 00:01:09,500
And that's simply because we didn't define any route

26
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,850
for this URL, right?

27
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:16,333
We do not have any handler that is associated to this route.

28
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:19,780
And so, if we actually want to access something

29
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,460
from our file system,

30
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:24,043
we need to use a built-in Express middleware.

31
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,120
So let me now show you how we can do that.

32
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:31,603
For example, after this one.

33
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:38,110
Now in this section we're actually just talking about an API

34
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:41,140
so we don't actually need to serve static files

35
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:44,660
like images or HTML, so what I just showed you.

36
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:46,590
But since this section is an introduction

37
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:48,350
to Express in general,

38
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:52,253
I also wanted to quickly show this content to you anyway.

39
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:56,360
So, as I was saying, all we have to do is

40
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:59,380
to use a simple built-in middleware

41
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:01,090
that goes like this.

42
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:05,160
Express dot static, because we wanna serve static files,

43
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,500
so this is an obvious name for that.

44
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,170
And so in here we pass the directory

45
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:12,490
from which we want to serve static files.

46
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:15,200
And in this case, I'm gonna use the public directory.

47
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,910
So this folder here where we have these HTML files, okay?

48
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:21,490
And actually let's use a template string here

49
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:26,490
so that I can go ahead and use the dirname variable,

50
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:30,470
then slash and public.

51
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:33,214
Give it a save and go back to the browser.

52
00:02:33,214 --> 00:02:37,130
Then we will be able to open this overview.html.

53
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:40,200
Now it's not going to work in this URL here.

54
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,540
It actually has to be like this.

55
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:46,290
So without the public, just /overview.html.

56
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:48,650
So let's see, and it actually works.

57
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:49,483
Okay.

58
00:02:49,483 --> 00:02:50,430
Now, why is that?

59
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:53,700
Why don't we need the public folder here in the URL?

60
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,650
Well, simply because when we open up a URL

61
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:58,780
that it can't find in any of our routes,

62
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:02,480
it will then look in that public folder that we defined.

63
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,620
And it sets that folder to the root.

64
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:08,210
Okay, so let's pretend that the root

65
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:09,730
is now our public folder.

66
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:12,740
So this here, and then the overview is in there.

67
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:15,003
And so that's why we have done access to it.

68
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:18,530
So in there we also have images, for example.

69
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:23,530
Let's say we wanna open image and then this pin here.

70
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,053
And we can do that.

71
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:27,853
So image,

72
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:33,200
pin png, and so here we go.

73
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,490
Here is the image.

74
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:38,830
Now what we can't do is this, because this is not a file.

75
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:41,060
This looks like a regular route,

76
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:44,960
and so Express actually tries to find a route handler

77
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,070
for this one, which it can't

78
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:49,100
because you didn't define anything.

79
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:49,933
All right?

80
00:03:49,933 --> 00:03:52,440
So really it just works for static files.

81
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:56,330
In which case it will, again, not go into a new route,

82
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:58,790
but simply serve that file that we specified

83
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:00,280
from the public folder,

84
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,043
or in the folder that we specified here in this middleware.

85
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:09,480
Now take a look at the console here and see all the requests

86
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,660
that were actually done when we open up that page.

87
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:15,690
Let's now clear this here just so we see all the requests

88
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:18,090
that actually just come from that overview page.

89
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:23,870
So let's write again overview.html here.

90
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,696
And these images here are broken

91
00:04:25,696 --> 00:04:28,810
and that's because this html is not supposed

92
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,720
to be served like this, all right?

93
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,320
I'm just using it now here

94
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,223
so that we get some visual feedback.

95
00:04:35,271 --> 00:04:38,423
I'm not interested at all in the content here.

96
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:42,800
Now just take a look at all the requests

97
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,950
that were done for all of the assets.

98
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,580
So as I said right in the beginning,

99
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:49,600
for each piece that is part of the website

100
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,360
our server actually gets a separate request.

101
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:55,070
And you see here that most of them get this 404.

102
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:59,260
So that's why the links are then broken on the web page,

103
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:02,270
well simply because Express cannot find them in this folder.

104
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:04,090
But again, that's not the point here.

105
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:05,650
What I just wanted to show you

106
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:07,496
is how we can serve static files

107
00:05:07,496 --> 00:05:10,806
from a folder and not from a route.

108
00:05:10,806 --> 00:05:11,950
All right.

109
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:15,840
And so that wraps up the basic introduction to Express.

110
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,300
In the next two videos we will talk

111
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,266
about something called environment variables

112
00:05:19,266 --> 00:05:22,573
and we will also set up ESlint in oral VS code.
