00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:02.490
<v Narrator>Welcome back.</v>

2
00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.300
In this lecture, we will install MongoDB on macOS.

3
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.370
Now, if you're a Windows user,

4
00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:12.200
then please mark this video as completed,

5
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.170
and move on right to the next one

6
00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:15.880
because the installation process

7
00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.380
is actually quite different on Windows

8
00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:19.523
than it is on Mac.

9
00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.350
So fire up your browser,

10
00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.070
and open MongoDB.com.

11
00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.903
Okay?

12
00:00:25.903 --> 00:00:27.600
Then, move to products.

13
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.760
And then over here, the MongoDB server.

14
00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.640
So, open that one up.

15
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.290
And so that takes us to the MongoDB download center.

16
00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.900
So the one that we want is the MongoDB community server,

17
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.260
and then of course, the current release.

18
00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.040
So not the more experimental four point one.

19
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.840
Then, your OS should automatically

20
00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.550
be selected as macOS.

21
00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.033
And then the package.

22
00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:53.960
This is the only option anyway.

23
00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.750
And so, hit download.

24
00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.440
And then wait for it to complete.

25
00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.090
Now while this is downloading,

26
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.230
notice how the website here talks about MongoDB Atlas

27
00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.530
which is Mongo's database as a service.

28
00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.820
So basically, it's running MongoDB in the Cloud on Atlas

29
00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.580
instead of running it locally.

30
00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.130
And actually, later in this section,

31
00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.390
that is exactly what we're gonna do.

32
00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.140
So we will create an Atlas account,

33
00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.810
and run our database in the Cloud.

34
00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:23.690
Okay?

35
00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.530
So in this video, we're downloading and installing

36
00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.070
the local version of MongoDB,

37
00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.310
which we will use to get familiar with the database system.

38
00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:34.780
But then, by the end of the section,

39
00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.000
we will actually transition to the hosted version,

40
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.190
and that's the one we will then use

41
00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.870
in our real application until the end of the course.

42
00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:44.703
All right.

43
00:01:44.703 --> 00:01:46.400
And with the file now downloaded,

44
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.800
let's go ahead and extract it,

45
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.220
and take a look at the content.

46
00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:52.990
And what we need here is basically

47
00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.180
these executable files here.

48
00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:56.730
And what we need to do with them

49
00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.170
is to copy them into a special binary folder

50
00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.260
that we have on our system.

51
00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:03.093
Okay?

52
00:02:03.093 --> 00:02:07.040
So let's move into our terminal and do a copy command,

53
00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.930
and we're gonna need some permissions forwarded,

54
00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:11.050
so I'm starting with sudo here.

55
00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.890
Then cp for copy.

56
00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.310
And now, I'm gonna go add and drag

57
00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.960
all of these files in here so that

58
00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.803
I don't have to write the path to them out.

59
00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.060
Okay.

60
00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.990
So that's all of the files that we're gonna copy.

61
00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.420
And we will copy them into a folder

62
00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.420
called slash usr local slash bin.

63
00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.860
Hit return on that, and just to make sure

64
00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.060
they're actually there, let's actually go there.

65
00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.203
Usr local slash bin.

66
00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.410
Take a look at the files there.

67
00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.190
And indeed, here they are.

68
00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.830
So basically these red files are the ones

69
00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.040
that we just copied there.

70
00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.060
So these aren't executable.

71
00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.260
Now since we're in this folder,

72
00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.120
you might actually see some other interesting stuff here.

73
00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.950
For example, there's nodemon command here.

74
00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.990
That is the global nodemon package

75
00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:07.340
that we actually installed before.

76
00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.860
I mean, it's not really the package itself,

77
00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.890
but it is this what allows us to run

78
00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:14.793
the nodemon command globally.

79
00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.600
Next up, we're gonna create a folder

80
00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.610
where the database can then actually store the data.

81
00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.060
And again, we're gonna need permissions for that.

82
00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.610
So mkdir to make the new directory,

83
00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:32.470
and then slash data slash db.

84
00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:33.440
Hit return.

85
00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.940
And in my case, this folder actually already exists.

86
00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.240
And so, I'm not able to create a new one.

87
00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:43.480
But in your case, I'm sure this worked just fine.

88
00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.520
Next up, we need to give some permissions

89
00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.660
in order for the database to be able

90
00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.820
to write in this folder.

91
00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.343
And so for that, again, we use sudo.

92
00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.463
Then this weird command here, chown, or whatever.

93
00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.600
And R for recursive.

94
00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:06.600
Then id minus un and slash data slash db.

95
00:04:09.881 --> 00:04:10.870
All right.

96
00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.460
So this looks a bit like black magic here,

97
00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:15.500
but again, just follow this recipe

98
00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.900
in order to just make this work.

99
00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.660
Anyway, we should now be good to go.

100
00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.480
And call mongod.

101
00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:24.763
So let's try that out.

102
00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:29.060
So let's make this window a bit bigger.

103
00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.900
And so indeed, we now have the Mongo process running here.

104
00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:33.740
Okay.

105
00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.430
So it starts up here.

106
00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.950
And then gives us all the stuff that we don't really need.

107
00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:41.720
And by the end, it tells us that it's waiting

108
00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.653
for connections on port 27017.

109
00:04:45.644 --> 00:04:46.477
Okay?

110
00:04:46.477 --> 00:04:50.030
So this here is basically like a Mongo server.

111
00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:50.863
Okay?

112
00:04:50.863 --> 00:04:54.630
So this means that MongoDB is now running in the background.

113
00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.420
But we need to now actually connect to it

114
00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:59.960
in order to create new databases,

115
00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.880
and create new collections and all that good stuff.

116
00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:03.713
Okay?

117
00:05:03.713 --> 00:05:05.120
So in this terminal window,

118
00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.730
we will leave this process running.

119
00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:10.240
So basically this MongoDB server.

120
00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.980
And we then open another tab,

121
00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:14.060
or you could open another window.

122
00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:17.710
But I just use command t to open another tab.

123
00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.340
And now, we run the Mongo shell

124
00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.630
simply by writing Mongo.

125
00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:23.463
All right.

126
00:05:23.463 --> 00:05:26.400
And we are now connected to our MongoDB server

127
00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.000
that is running on local host on the default port

128
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.650
that I just mentioned before.

129
00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:33.240
So this one.

130
00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.073
Okay.

131
00:05:34.073 --> 00:05:35.380
So we are now connected to that,

132
00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:38.130
and so let's now write db here,

133
00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:40.670
which should return the task database.

134
00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:42.250
And it did.

135
00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:43.083
So.

136
00:05:43.083 --> 00:05:45.730
We have a test database already on our computer.

137
00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:48.300
And so this means that it works.

138
00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:49.830
So, great.

139
00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:52.310
Now we could have used this Mongo shell here

140
00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:55.220
to also connect to a remote database.

141
00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:56.880
So, remember how in the beginning,

142
00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.840
I talked about the MongoDB Atlas

143
00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.600
which is basically a database running in the Cloud.

144
00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:04.430
So a remote database.

145
00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:07.630
And so here, we could use this MongoDB shell

146
00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:09.540
to also connect to that one.

147
00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:12.750
But if we simply run the mongo command like we did here,

148
00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:14.490
it will just automatically connect

149
00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:16.820
to the local MongoDB database

150
00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:18.970
that is running on local host.

151
00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:19.803
Okay.

152
00:06:19.803 --> 00:06:21.280
So that's it for this video.

153
00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:23.740
In the next one, we will then create

154
00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:26.130
our first new database, and start

155
00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:28.983
to interact a little bit more with this Mongo shell.
