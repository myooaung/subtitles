00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:02.090
<v ->Welcome back.</v>

2
00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:04.653
In this video, let's start to implement some routes

3
00:00:04.653 --> 00:00:07.023
for the users' resource.

4
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.110
So, our A-P-I will have a couple of different resources.

5
00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:14.080
The first one that we already talked about

6
00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.490
and started to implement is the tours resource.

7
00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.240
But another one will be the users' resource.

8
00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.900
So that, for example, we can create user accounts

9
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.680
and have different user roles

10
00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.003
and all that good stuff that comes with users, right?

11
00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.030
Now, of course, for now, this users' resource

12
00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:34.720
will be very similar to the tours resource.

13
00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.970
But I still want to start implementing this resource

14
00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.240
at this point because we need to move forward

15
00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.990
in the project and also because I need it

16
00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:47.460
in order to prepare for what I'm gonna teach you next, okay?

17
00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.300
So let's go ahead and move down here to our route,

18
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.290
and so what we'll do again, something very similar,

19
00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.016
to what we already have here.

20
00:00:57.016 --> 00:01:00.519
(keyboard clicking)

21
00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:02.160
So app.route,

22
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.521
and route is gonna be slash A-P-I,

23
00:01:05.521 --> 00:01:07.073
slash version one,

24
00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:09.410
and then users'.

25
00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:13.590
Okay, and then we will respond to the get request

26
00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.140
using a function, then we're going to create next called get

27
00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.940
all users.

28
00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:21.970
So you see that the structure that I'm gonna follow

29
00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.810
is very similar to the one with tours.

30
00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.710
So, when we do get or post on the route without the ID,

31
00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.440
so, just like this or just like this,

32
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.640
it means that we either want to get all the users,

33
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.100
so basically, all the objects that are part of

34
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.130
a resource, and if we use post, then we want to create

35
00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.550
a new resource on a server, okay?

36
00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.153
So, that pattern is always gonna be the same.

37
00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.740
So, create user for now.

38
00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.630
And, so, now it's giving me an error because

39
00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.460
all these functions are not defined,

40
00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.634
but don't worry about that.

41
00:01:57.634 --> 00:02:00.810
(keyboard clicking)

42
00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.120
So, A-P-I, actually, slash,

43
00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.363
so we always need to start with a slash.

44
00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:10.700
Users, and then just like before,

45
00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.730
we have to use this ID as a parameter interrupt.

46
00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.040
Okay, then, if we do get request specifying that ID,

47
00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.950
it means that we want to get one user.

48
00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.450
So, I'm just calling it get user.

49
00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:26.283
Okay?

50
00:02:26.283 --> 00:02:28.540
And there are different kind of standards here,

51
00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.920
so you could call this one, here, get one user,

52
00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.050
and this one here get all users,

53
00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.770
but I prefer to just do it like this, all right?

54
00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.233
So, we also want to respond to the patch request.

55
00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:41.993
So, update user,

56
00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.333
and then also delete.

57
00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.130
And this one is gonna be called delete user.

58
00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:55.130
Give it a save, and, so it nicely formats our code, here.

59
00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:56.190
And, so, let's go ahead

60
00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.900
and quickly create these five functions.

61
00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.020
And we're gonna do that all right away,

62
00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:02.700
because we will actually not

63
00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.500
do anything for the users at this point.

64
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.980
Okay, again I just wanted to have this implemented

65
00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.510
in order to show you something next.

66
00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.363
Okay, so, I'm going to go ahead, copy this one here.

67
00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.110
And, yeah, so, add a tier right after

68
00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.010
the last route handler from the tours.

69
00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.693
So, const get all users.

70
00:03:25.674 --> 00:03:29.330
(keyboard clicking)

71
00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:32.160
And what I will do here is to simply send back a message

72
00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.780
that this route is not yet implemented.

73
00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.290
So, response to status that I'm going to specify as 500,

74
00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.100
which means internal server error, and

75
00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.560
so, yeah, for now that's just kind of a place holder,

76
00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.050
so we still send back a adjacent object with a status,

77
00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:54.900
which in this case, when there is a 500 error code

78
00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.170
we say that it's an error, okay?

79
00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:59.913
So, what was that weird error completion,

80
00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:04.697
we simply only want error, and then message:

81
00:04:04.697 --> 00:04:08.167
(keyboard clicking)

82
00:04:08.167 --> 00:04:11.310
this route is not yet defined.

83
00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.720
All right, give this a save,

84
00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.020
and I'm going to go ahead and copy this a couple of times,

85
00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:19.763
and simply do the same for all the other ones.

86
00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.633
Okay, so, get all users, then get user,

87
00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.963
then I want create user,

88
00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.370
I want to update user

89
00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:41.470
and delete, oh where is that?

90
00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:42.653
It's nowhere here.

91
00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.300
Delete user.

92
00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:47.360
Okay.

93
00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.980
So now, there's no more error and

94
00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:53.050
let's get rid of this piece of code.

95
00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.180
And, so, if we now create a request for this

96
00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:57.330
let's see what happens.

97
00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.683
And close this one, copy this one.

98
00:05:06.766 --> 00:05:08.566
And, oh yeah, of course.

99
00:05:08.566 --> 00:05:12.566
So, I needed to change this to users, obviously.

100
00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:17.260
And so now we have our 500 internal server error here,

101
00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.210
and then this route is not yet defined.

102
00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:22.880
Let's still go ahead and save this request

103
00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.410
into a new collection.

104
00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:27.430
Actually, we want it in the same collection,

105
00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:28.643
just another folder.

106
00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.453
So let's create a folder later.

107
00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.950
So we get all users.

108
00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:36.880
Save it here.

109
00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.720
And now we can go ahead and create a folder,

110
00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.940
and not like this, but this.

111
00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:46.700
So, add folder, and so let's add one folder

112
00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:48.270
for each of the resource.

113
00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:49.233
So we have tour,

114
00:05:51.232 --> 00:05:53.290
and we have users.

115
00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:56.367
So it's gonna called just like the--

116
00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:58.220
like the resource.

117
00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:03.083
All right, for some reason I cannot select all of them.

118
00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.033
That's no problem.

119
00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:14.700
All right, so now we have them nicely organized here

120
00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:17.910
in our collection, and that's a lot nicer.

121
00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:20.680
All right, so that is how we define code

122
00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:23.200
for our second resource.

123
00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.980
All right, so this file is kind of a mess,

124
00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:28.360
so, we have all of this mixed-up together in the same file,

125
00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.564
all these routes, all these handlers, here,

126
00:06:31.564 --> 00:06:34.253
which we can also call controllers, by the way.

127
00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:40.230
Okay, and so we have all these different pieces in the same

128
00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:44.110
file and eventually we will want to fix that.

129
00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:47.280
So, in the next video, we're gonna take the first step in

130
00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:50.190
order to be able to actually separate all these different

131
00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:52.133
pieces into different files.
