00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:03.990
<v Narrator>So now that the user photo upload feature</v>

2
00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.080
is completed, let's now learn how to upload multiple files

3
00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.080
at the same time and also how

4
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.170
to process multiple images at the same time.

5
00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.430
And so in this lecture and the next one,

6
00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:18.713
we're going to be uploading and processing tour pictures.

7
00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.750
And to start let's actually remember what kind

8
00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:28.070
of images we want for our tours and also how many,

9
00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.033
and so we should take a look at our tour model here.

10
00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:37.450
And so here we have the image cover

11
00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.170
and that is actually only one image

12
00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.400
and then also we have the image field

13
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.610
which is going to be an array of images.

14
00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.390
And typically these should be at least three images

15
00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.000
because that is the amount of images that we have

16
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.950
in the tour detail page.

17
00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:53.810
Right?

18
00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.010
So again, we're going to have image cover

19
00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.290
and images as an array.

20
00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:59.410
All right.

21
00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:01.240
Now the way we're going to upload

22
00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.080
and process these images is going to be very similar

23
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.140
to what we did with the users,

24
00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.620
and so let's actually go ahead into the user controller

25
00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.444
and copy at least this initial part here

26
00:01:13.444 --> 00:01:15.820
of the multer configuration.

27
00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.620
All right, so grab that and then

28
00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.883
in the tour controller, right here at the top,

29
00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.774
lets put it right here and also

30
00:01:25.774 --> 00:01:29.293
lets also get the multer and sharp requiring.

31
00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:37.610
All right, great.

32
00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.850
And so just like before we will store

33
00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.750
the images in memory, all right,

34
00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.900
and also we only allow images to pass our filter.

35
00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.720
So in other words we only want to be able to upload images.

36
00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:52.553
All right.

37
00:01:52.553 --> 00:01:54.670
Then here we create or upload in

38
00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.060
the exact same way as before,

39
00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.180
and so now lets actually create

40
00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.420
the middleware out of this upload.

41
00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:02.780
All right.

42
00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.780
So export dot upload tour, images, then upload.

43
00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.536
And now here comes the different part,

44
00:02:14.536 --> 00:02:17.020
so something that's going to be different

45
00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.650
to what we did here in the users controller

46
00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.380
because we had upload dot single.

47
00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:25.213
Okay.

48
00:02:25.213 --> 00:02:28.110
And so that was because we only had one single field

49
00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.000
with a file that we wanted to upload

50
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.930
and so that here is the name of that field.

51
00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:33.763
Right?

52
00:02:33.763 --> 00:02:36.150
But now we actually have multiple files

53
00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.490
and in one of them we have one image

54
00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.920
and in the other one we have three images.

55
00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.537
So, how can we do that?

56
00:02:42.537 --> 00:02:47.010
Well, we're going to use upload dot fields,

57
00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.850
and so multer is actually perfectly capable

58
00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.280
of handling this kind of situations.

59
00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.570
So here we pass in an array and each

60
00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.520
of the elements is an object where we

61
00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.283
then specify the field name.

62
00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:02.420
And so the first one, remember,

63
00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.420
is image cover, and then we say that the max count is one.

64
00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.820
And so that means that we can only have

65
00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.220
one field called image cover,

66
00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.730
which is then going to be processed.

67
00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.163
All right, and then let's do the same for our images,

68
00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.210
so that is the other field in our database

69
00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:26.300
and so here we call it images as well

70
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.683
and here lets say that the max count is three.

71
00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:32.783
All right.

72
00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.350
And in case that we didn't have the image cover

73
00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:41.340
and if that only had one field which accepts multiple images

74
00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.870
or multiple files at the same time,

75
00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.483
we could have done it like this.

76
00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:51.910
So we would then use upload dot array, okay?

77
00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:53.460
And then the name of the field,

78
00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.730
and then basically the max count here as a number like this.

79
00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:01.640
All right?

80
00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:06.120
So when there's one only, then it's upload dot single,

81
00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.240
let's say image, when there is multiple with the same name,

82
00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.330
then it's upload dot array and when there's basically

83
00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:19.303
a mix of them, then it is upload dot fields.

84
00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:22.750
Okay?

85
00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.300
Now maybe this looks a bit complicated now,

86
00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.320
so lets before we move on actually replicate

87
00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.630
this kind of query in Postman, okay?

88
00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.750
And actually before we do that,

89
00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.523
we need to create a new tour.

90
00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.280
All right, and actually I will do that here

91
00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.490
in compass simply by duplicating one of

92
00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.330
the tours that we already have.

93
00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.623
So lets say here, the Sea Explorer,

94
00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.680
and now I'm duplicating it.

95
00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.780
And so here I can change what I want to have different

96
00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.743
and this one is called The Mountain Biker,

97
00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:04.263
let's say duration of five, max group size of ten,

98
00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:08.120
and then what really matters is to get rid of

99
00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:12.840
the image cover because that's what we want to update later

100
00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.453
and also the images array.

101
00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:20.300
Created at can also go and of course

102
00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:25.300
we need to change the slug, so the mountain biker.

103
00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:28.710
Okay?

104
00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:30.390
And by the way we needed to create

105
00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:34.200
a new tour like this so that we actually have the locations,

106
00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.970
the summary and description, and all that stuff,

107
00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:41.030
so that the tourist can correctly render in our website.

108
00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:44.770
All right, so lets insert it and so

109
00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:49.270
it should be somewhere here right at the end, okay.

110
00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:54.270
So let's grab the ID here and now here in Postman

111
00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:59.020
lets then update tour.

112
00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:02.960
So we pass that in here and now in our body,

113
00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:07.960
lets remember that we need to change from raw to form data.

114
00:06:08.104 --> 00:06:09.103
Okay?

115
00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:16.490
Let's close all of these here and also lets login here

116
00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:20.210
as an admin because otherwise updating

117
00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:22.010
the tour is not going to be working.

118
00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:28.070
So admin@nators.io, all right.

119
00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:35.508
And so now let's just recreate a body request here

120
00:06:35.508 --> 00:06:38.210
similar to we just specified here.

121
00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:42.070
So basically similar to what our multer upload expects,

122
00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:44.973
so one image cover and three images.

123
00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:52.060
So, image cover, which is a file, and so lets select that.

124
00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:58.630
And so here we have these new photos for tours

125
00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:02.050
and lets actually use this first one here

126
00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:05.837
as the cover image and then images,

127
00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:12.290
lets put that here to file as well,

128
00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:14.543
and then here the other three.

129
00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:19.943
And now as you see, all of them will be called images.

130
00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:29.940
Okay, and we can only have a maximum of three,

131
00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:32.070
at least only three of them are going

132
00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:34.680
to be processed by multer, all right?

133
00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:40.490
And actually here you see that we really need

134
00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:43.380
to resize this one because on our website

135
00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:46.090
all of them appear in this landscape format

136
00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:48.550
and not portrait like we have it here.

137
00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:49.383
All right?

138
00:07:49.383 --> 00:07:51.139
And so that's of course why it's necessary

139
00:07:51.139 --> 00:07:55.940
to also process these images, all right?

140
00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:58.590
And of course we can also change other stuff here,

141
00:07:58.590 --> 00:08:03.563
so lets say we want to change the price to 9-9-7, okay?

142
00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:09.690
Now, I'm not going to send this request just yet

143
00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:12.500
because we don't have any logic implemented

144
00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:15.280
to handle it at this point, right,

145
00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:17.260
because we're not really uploading it

146
00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:21.360
to the file system, but only saving it to memory.

147
00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:23.870
And so just to quickly take a look at them

148
00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:26.808
lets actually create our next middleware here,

149
00:08:26.808 --> 00:08:29.913
which is going to be the one to process these images.

150
00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:36.250
So export dot resize tour images, so request, response,

151
00:08:42.810 --> 00:08:47.810
and next, and now lets here log them to the console.

152
00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:53.840
All right, and in case we have multiple files

153
00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:58.520
it is actually on request dot files, and not just file.

154
00:08:58.520 --> 00:08:59.610
All right?

155
00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:02.460
So this here basically will produce request dot file

156
00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:07.870
while the fields and the array

157
00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:12.603
will both produce request dot files, so the plural.

158
00:09:14.215 --> 00:09:16.420
All right, so then log this to the console

159
00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:19.690
and then also lets call next here so that

160
00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:21.440
we can actually then later finish

161
00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:25.000
the request-response cycle, okay.

162
00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.730
Give it a save and now all we need

163
00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:29.700
to do in order to actually test the request is

164
00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:32.790
to add these two new middlewares to the route handler.

165
00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:37.130
All right, so tour routes and just like with the users,

166
00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:39.600
to keep it simple here, we will only allow

167
00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:41.953
uploading images on a tour update.

168
00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:48.360
So down here is where we have that patch request, all right,

169
00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:52.320
and so we already have a bunch of middlewares,

170
00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:56.180
so protect, restrict to admins and guides,

171
00:09:56.180 --> 00:10:01.180
and now lets also add tour controller dot upload tour images

172
00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:08.160
and tour controller dot resize tour images.

173
00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:13.130
So that's a really nice middleware stack right here, okay?

174
00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:16.000
And so I think that now we're ready to actually test

175
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.890
the request that we created here.

176
00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:21.830
And again of course it's not really going to do anything,

177
00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:24.500
it's not going to be saving these images anywhere

178
00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:26.780
and also not updating the database

179
00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:30.453
but for now we just want to see the result in the console.

180
00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:34.290
Well it should have actually updated the price

181
00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:37.010
so lets quickly take a look at that.

182
00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:39.790
Yeah, so the price now updated but again

183
00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:43.200
the images obviously did not, all right?

184
00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:46.810
And now here we have them in the console,

185
00:10:46.810 --> 00:10:49.843
so lets make that a little bit bigger

186
00:10:49.843 --> 00:10:53.400
and so here we have the image cover where

187
00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:56.520
we got the field name, the original name,

188
00:10:56.520 --> 00:11:00.620
and also the mimetype, okay, then you see the buffer here,

189
00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:03.230
and so this is basically a representation of

190
00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:05.240
the image in memory.

191
00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:06.810
Now it's important here to note

192
00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:10.953
is that actually even the image cover is an array, okay?

193
00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:13.590
So when we're going to retrieve

194
00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:16.480
the image from image cover we then will have

195
00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:19.660
to use the first element of this array.

196
00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:22.380
And then in the images, here it's obvious

197
00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:24.700
that we have an array and here for each of

198
00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:28.080
the images we then have an object like this.

199
00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:32.530
So with the original name, tour four, three and two,

200
00:11:32.530 --> 00:11:34.363
and then each of them as a buffer.

201
00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:40.860
All right, so everything is nicely connected

202
00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:45.353
and so all we now need to do is to basically create

203
00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:49.300
this resize tour images, because this is where

204
00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:51.290
the images will then be processed

205
00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:53.210
and also saved to disk.

206
00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:56.903
Okay, and so that is the topic of the next lecture.
