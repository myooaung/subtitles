<v ->Welcome back to one of the most important,</v>

3
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:09,500
and also most advanced sections of the entire course.

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,280
And in this one, you're gonna learn how to implement

5
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:16,163
authentication, authorization, and security.

6
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:20,100
So, authentication and authorization

7
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,230
is all about users signing up

8
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,680
and logging into or applications

9
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:27,960
and allowing them to access certain protected parts

10
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,930
of the app that are not accessible to non-logged in users.

11
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:34,930
So that's really cool,

12
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:39,430
and it makes the app seem even more real world, right?

13
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:41,830
So to implement authentication,

14
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:43,800
we're gonna use a very modern technique

15
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,800
called JSON Web Tokens,

16
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,083
which are actually perfect for the API that we're building.

17
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:53,085
And now I can't wait to show you how it all works.

18
00:00:53,085 --> 00:00:56,252
