00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:03.200
<v Instructor>All right, this is part two</v>

2
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.313
of Building the Tour Page Detail Page.

3
00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:08.820
And we left off the last video

4
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.630
after building this Quick Facts part here

5
00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:14.130
using some mixins, right?

6
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.550
And so next up it's time to build

7
00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.010
this part here of the guides.

8
00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:21.550
Now we don't know beforehand how many tour guides

9
00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.950
there actually are on each tour.

10
00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:26.150
And so just like on the overview page,

11
00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:27.930
here we need to have another loop

12
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.260
to basically loop through all the guides

13
00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.423
that are associated with a certain tour.

14
00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.220
So, let's do that.

15
00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.900
And right now we actually have these three elements.

16
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.210
So these three box, one for each guide.

17
00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.570
But as we just said, that's not how we want it to work.

18
00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.970
So let's get rid of these two and then create a loop here,

19
00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.210
which in each iteration will create a box,

20
00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.620
so an element like this.

21
00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.553
And that should be fairly easy.

22
00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:01.880
So again, we use each

23
00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.923
and then the name of the variable in the current iteration,

24
00:01:08.505 --> 00:01:11.580
in, and then the array that we want to loop through.

25
00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.933
And so that's tour.guides.

26
00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:18.230
Right?

27
00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:19.063
So,

28
00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.913
where is that?

29
00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.620
Yeah, so here is our array of guides.

30
00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.810
Which of course, in the database will then be populated

31
00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.393
with the corresponding users and not just the IDs, right?

32
00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.803
So now we need to indent all of this here.

33
00:01:38.902 --> 00:01:40.350
And so each of these guides here

34
00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.220
will basically be a user document.

35
00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.010
So let's quickly check that out in Compass

36
00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:50.560
because we don't have that kind of data in our JSON document

37
00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.390
because, of course, the population only happens

38
00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.520
behind the scenes using Mongos, right?

39
00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.600
So each of the guides is a user.

40
00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.573
And so what we want is the name and the photo.

41
00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.893
So here we want the photo, of course.

42
00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.140
Which is, in this page,

43
00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.683
at images/users and then the name of the user photo.

44
00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.850
So guide.photo.

45
00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.350
Which is here, again, the variable name

46
00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.540
in the current iteration.

47
00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.130
Then here I don't know why it says Lead guide,

48
00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.223
but let's actually put the name of the person here.

49
00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.520
So guide.name.

50
00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.713
Then here we want the guide's name again,

51
00:02:45.997 --> 00:02:46.850
.name.

52
00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.330
And then we also want the label.

53
00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:50.940
And so basically that will be

54
00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.060
Lead guide when it's lead guide

55
00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.810
and simply tour guide when it's a regular guide.

56
00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.270
Now let me show you what happens

57
00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:00.223
when we just put the role here.

58
00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.830
So remember that role is the property

59
00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.040
where we say if a user is a guide

60
00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.333
or a lead guide or even an admin.

61
00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:11.450
Okay?

62
00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.030
So, again, let's for now see what happens

63
00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.130
when we just put it like this.

64
00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.963
And with that we should be ready to actually test it.

65
00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.030
Let's give it a save.

66
00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:24.700
And here we go.

67
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.800
So we have the three photos, the names,

68
00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.440
but then here the guide role

69
00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.020
doesn't really look good, right?

70
00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:37.640
So remember how, in fact, we want to say lead guide

71
00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:38.883
and tour guide.

72
00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.270
Okay, and so now it's time to use a conditional.

73
00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:46.080
Now pug actually has conditionals built in,

74
00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.390
but they are really simple and we can't

75
00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.020
do a lot of stuff with them.

76
00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:52.240
For example, they don't even allow us

77
00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.990
to test for equality, for example.

78
00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:56.520
But, the good thing is that we can

79
00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.813
actually still use JavaScript for that.

80
00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:03.190
And so again, we use some unbuffered code for that.

81
00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.730
So with the dash syntax and then we can

82
00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:08.023
use a regular JavaScript if here.

83
00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.180
So again, as if we were just writing JavaScript.

84
00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.340
And so guide.role and now we can test and say

85
00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:19.873
if it's a lead-guide.

86
00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:24.340
Well then here we want to say

87
00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:28.753
Lead guide, okay?

88
00:04:32.309 --> 00:04:33.980
And let's put another one here

89
00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:37.320
and say if the role is just guide,

90
00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.690
well, then we want Tour guide.

91
00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:44.660
And so this is how we use a JavaScript if write inside

92
00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:48.823
of pug and then combine it with a pug output like this.

93
00:04:50.237 --> 00:04:51.320
All right?

94
00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:53.720
So, let's see.

95
00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.333
And indeed, that is much nicer.

96
00:04:58.660 --> 00:04:59.830
Okay.

97
00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:03.350
Let's get rid of this empty space here

98
00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:05.200
and move on to the next one,

99
00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.883
which is the description box.

100
00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:09.750
So first up here in the heading

101
00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:12.320
we actually also have the name of the tour.

102
00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.250
So this here is the name of the tour,

103
00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.310
and so let's create a template string,

104
00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:21.220
and in there let's put tour.name.

105
00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:25.070
I thought that would work.

106
00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:27.750
But it doesn't.

107
00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:29.250
This only works in JavaScript.

108
00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:33.040
Okay, and actually I just remembered

109
00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:38.040
that we also want to have the tour right in the main title.

110
00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:42.573
So, right here actually.

111
00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:45.983
Okay, so let's do that.

112
00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:51.873
Okay.

113
00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.500
But anyway, let's move down here

114
00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:59.010
and create these paragraphs.

115
00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:00.670
Now as you see we actually have

116
00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:04.090
two paragraphs here for this text.

117
00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:06.950
So let's just take a look at how we have it here

118
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:08.230
in the description.

119
00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:12.200
And as you see, we of course only have one big string.

120
00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:14.560
But we have it in the middle divided

121
00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.460
with these new line characters.

122
00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:17.293
All right?

123
00:06:17.293 --> 00:06:20.230
And so what we're gonna do is to split the string

124
00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:21.743
by the new line character.

125
00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:24.750
Okay?

126
00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:26.923
So that's easy, right?

127
00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:32.743
So, unbuffered code to write JavaScript.

128
00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:39.910
Paragraphs equals tour.description.split

129
00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.853
by the new line character.

130
00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:50.400
And so this will now create an array.

131
00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:52.460
So paragraphs is an array,

132
00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:55.893
where each of the element is basically one paragraph.

133
00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:57.840
Okay?

134
00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:00.130
And so now all we need to do is to loop

135
00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:03.940
through all of these paragraphs and print their content.

136
00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:06.520
So each p, let's say,

137
00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:10.280
in paragraphs will be p.description_text

138
00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:17.063
equal to the current paragraph, which is p.

139
00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:22.343
So, simple right?

140
00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:24.653
Let's check that out.

141
00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:30.160
And we cannot really see if it's different

142
00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:32.870
because I just used this blind text here.

143
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:34.760
But I can tell you that this here

144
00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:36.340
should be the correct text.

145
00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:38.630
And if we go to the forest hiker tour,

146
00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:39.880
actually here in Compass,

147
00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:43.620
so where is that?

148
00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:46.480
Right here.

149
00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:48.613
So if we go here to the description

150
00:07:49.637 --> 00:07:51.173
and try to edit that,

151
00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:58.140
so let's just add another new line character here.

152
00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:03.460
Then let's update and then we should see a new paragraph

153
00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:05.460
popping up somewhere here.

154
00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:07.090
Let's change that.

155
00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:09.143
And that didn't go so well.

156
00:08:09.143 --> 00:08:10.800
I'm not sure why.

157
00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.680
I never tried to do it,

158
00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:16.560
so what I just did was the first time that I tried it.

159
00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:19.875
So I'm not sure what went wrong here.

160
00:08:19.875 --> 00:08:23.860
Maybe we really just need to create a new line

161
00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:25.190
by hitting enter,

162
00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:28.910
but that didn't really work out either.

163
00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:30.550
So let's see if we actually have

164
00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:32.223
the new line character here.

165
00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:35.360
And maybe it's this one here.

166
00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:38.723
Well, but never mind, just trust me on this.

167
00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:43.610
And now our new line is still there,

168
00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:44.833
what's happening?

169
00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:52.463
All right, here we go, let's update it.

170
00:08:57.830 --> 00:09:01.460
All right, now our other new line that we had here before

171
00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:04.440
also kind of disappeared, but never mind.

172
00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:05.920
I guess I just shouldn't have used

173
00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:09.430
Compass in order to edit this text here.

174
00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:10.690
Okay?

175
00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:13.630
Anyway, let's now move on to the images.

176
00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:15.960
And right now we don't see them here,

177
00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:19.710
but this is how it's supposed to look like, okay?

178
00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:21.410
So we have three images here

179
00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:23.603
displaying side-by-side like this.

180
00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:28.390
And so these are actually the images that are

181
00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:31.530
somewhere here.

182
00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:33.670
So yeah, in the images field

183
00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:36.800
we have this array of these three images.

184
00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:39.160
So once more we're going to use a loop

185
00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:42.360
in order to loop through them.

186
00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:43.933
So, simple enough.

187
00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:49.890
So, each image in tour.images.

188
00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:54.423
And so for each of them we want to create this.

189
00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:58.703
So here the source.

190
00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:03.963
And that's image/tours, actually.

191
00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:10.360
And then the name of the current image,

192
00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:13.730
which is image of course.

193
00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:15.760
And then here in the alt text we have

194
00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:17.500
actually the number of the tour,

195
00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:21.700
and more importantly also here in the CSS class name.

196
00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:23.250
And so you see that the next one

197
00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:25.693
has that image two and image three.

198
00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:27.940
Okay?

199
00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:29.900
So how are we going to do that?

200
00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:32.250
Well, in a pug loop we can

201
00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:34.350
actually define a second variable.

202
00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:37.723
And that second variable is then going to be the index.

203
00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:41.280
So let's call that i, very simply.

204
00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:43.750
And so that is a zero-based index,

205
00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:46.660
which is going to be zero for the first element

206
00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:49.023
and one and two for the other two elements.

207
00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:53.233
And so let's first start by putting that there.

208
00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:02.460
So that is i, which is the index, plus 1,

209
00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:05.560
because we want this to be 1 and not zero.

210
00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:07.940
And now this part here is a bit trickier,

211
00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:11.420
because we cannot use this syntax,

212
00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:14.580
and we can also not use the other interpolation syntax

213
00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:16.330
right here in the class name.

214
00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:20.270
And so instead what we're going to do is to copy this,

215
00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:23.143
and actually define it as a class attribute.

216
00:11:25.610 --> 00:11:28.140
Okay, and so that is exactly the same.

217
00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:30.860
But here we can then use a template string

218
00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:33.363
in order to then fill that one here.

219
00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:37.393
So i + 1.

220
00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:41.990
All right, let's get rid of this.

221
00:11:46.222 --> 00:11:47.122
And let's test it.

222
00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:51.473
Whoa, something's not right here.

223
00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:57.450
So, we have our images, but they do not look correct.

224
00:11:57.450 --> 00:11:59.850
But the class name is actually right.

225
00:11:59.850 --> 00:12:02.010
And also you see it here applied.

226
00:12:02.010 --> 00:12:05.990
But for some reason it didn't find these images.

227
00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:07.940
Or actually it did.

228
00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:10.150
Down here it says that it didn't.

229
00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:12.057
Ah, but these are actually other images.

230
00:12:12.057 --> 00:12:16.460
But these are some other ones that are a bit further down.

231
00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:19.590
Anyway, what I guess is not correct here

232
00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:22.340
is that this image should be inside of this picture box,

233
00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:26.690
and so I guess something in our indentation here is wrong.

234
00:12:26.690 --> 00:12:29.681
And yeah, indeed that is.

235
00:12:29.681 --> 00:12:32.040
So you see this image is at the same level

236
00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:33.820
as this div element.

237
00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:36.613
So of course, there is a missing indentation.

238
00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:38.930
All right.

239
00:12:38.930 --> 00:12:40.530
And so that should now be fixed.

240
00:12:43.470 --> 00:12:44.973
And here we go.

241
00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:47.050
All right.

242
00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:49.973
So that, just to see that this was the problem.

243
00:12:51.316 --> 00:12:53.916
Now indeed the picture is inside of the picture box.

244
00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:56.580
So great.

245
00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:57.720
Next up is the map.

246
00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:02.170
Which remember, I'm going to leave for the next lecture,

247
00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:04.330
so that for now we can worry about

248
00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:08.140
putting the tour reviews here in this element.

249
00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:09.600
Okay.

250
00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:14.190
And so, again, we're now moving on to this part here.

251
00:13:14.190 --> 00:13:16.953
Now where are these reviews actually coming from.

252
00:13:17.810 --> 00:13:19.140
Well, remember how here

253
00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:21.390
in the viewController we did populate

254
00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:24.410
the reviews field with the actual review data.

255
00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:27.420
And so right now we have tours.reviews,

256
00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:29.766
which is an array of all the reviews.

257
00:13:29.766 --> 00:13:32.320
And so as you can probably guess,

258
00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:35.460
we are now going to create yet another loop

259
00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:37.763
right here inside this review element.

260
00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:44.640
So, each review in tour.reviews.

261
00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:52.670
And then in each of them we will have this review card.

262
00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:54.150
All right.

263
00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:56.460
Now this here is a lot of code,

264
00:13:56.460 --> 00:13:59.870
which is kind of distracting us here from our main content.

265
00:13:59.870 --> 00:14:02.943
And so let's again, actually create a mixin here.

266
00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:05.383
All right.

267
00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:07.780
So,

268
00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:09.230
let's put it here at the top.

269
00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:12.590
And you'll see why in a second.

270
00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:15.520
So reviewCard.

271
00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:20.193
And in here we pass the review itself.

272
00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:22.330
All right.

273
00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:25.330
And now we actually need to fix these indentations.

274
00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:26.870
And instead of doing it manually,

275
00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:28.370
remember, I'm going to use

276
00:14:28.370 --> 00:14:30.610
that VS Code package that we have.

277
00:14:30.610 --> 00:14:35.230
And so command shift p or control shift p on Windows

278
00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:37.193
and then Beautify pug.

279
00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:41.110
And so that fixes it.

280
00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:43.960
And so now we need to create this review here

281
00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:45.540
based on the data.

282
00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:48.790
But before we do that, let's actually call the mixin here

283
00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:50.890
in each iteration of the review.

284
00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:55.890
So +reviewCard with the current review, right?

285
00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:03.090
So, let's just take a look at what

286
00:15:03.090 --> 00:15:05.970
a review actually looks like.

287
00:15:05.970 --> 00:15:07.820
And we have the reviews here.

288
00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:10.140
But indeed, they will not be really useful

289
00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:12.773
because the user is not populated here.

290
00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:17.160
So let's actually go to a Postman

291
00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:21.830
and take a look at the final populated reviews in there.

292
00:15:21.830 --> 00:15:24.923
So let's say get review on tour.

293
00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:32.170
Because that will then be a complete review.

294
00:15:32.170 --> 00:15:35.890
So we have the review field, the rating, and then the user.

295
00:15:35.890 --> 00:15:37.370
And what we're interested in here

296
00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:40.593
is then user.name and user.photo.

297
00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:45.973
All right, and so the username will be review.user.name.

298
00:15:48.010 --> 00:15:48.843
Right?

299
00:15:51.130 --> 00:15:55.830
So review.user.name.

300
00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:58.490
And so all of this is necessary because of course

301
00:15:58.490 --> 00:16:02.340
we have now multiple datasets related to one each other

302
00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:04.050
and so with the populate function

303
00:16:04.050 --> 00:16:07.850
they are all now kind of nested one into each other.

304
00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:11.413
So let's use his name here as well.

305
00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:19.080
All right.

306
00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:20.130
And then here

307
00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:24.940
we will not use his name.

308
00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:29.790
Oh and I forgot the interpolation,

309
00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:32.683
and then here it's the photo.

310
00:16:33.554 --> 00:16:34.387
All right.

311
00:16:34.387 --> 00:16:37.063
Here it's going to be the description.

312
00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:43.113
And that's actually review.review, I believe.

313
00:16:45.390 --> 00:16:46.790
So, yeah.

314
00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:48.980
So review.review.

315
00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:52.510
And this is the easy part and the hard part next

316
00:16:52.510 --> 00:16:55.760
is going to be to display the actual rating,

317
00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:59.610
because we have to display one of these elements here

318
00:16:59.610 --> 00:17:02.730
for each of the number of stars that the review has.

319
00:17:02.730 --> 00:17:06.330
So a five-star review needs all of these five stars.

320
00:17:06.330 --> 00:17:09.130
But a four-star review only needs four of them

321
00:17:09.130 --> 00:17:12.420
and then plus that we also want a gray star.

322
00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:15.860
So basically to say four out of five, okay?

323
00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:18.993
But let's first take a look, if this is actually working.

324
00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:21.993
So everything except the rating.

325
00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:27.290
So let's reload, and indeed, here we are,

326
00:17:27.290 --> 00:17:31.680
with the users, then name, and the review text itself.

327
00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:34.190
And let's now take care of actually displaying

328
00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:36.550
the rating as well.

329
00:17:36.550 --> 00:17:38.270
So what we're gonna do here is

330
00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:40.880
to print the amount of stars in a loop.

331
00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:42.920
So there are five possible stars

332
00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:45.660
and so we loop from one to five.

333
00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:49.270
Then in each star we test if the tour rating

334
00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:52.260
is higher or equal to the current star.

335
00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:54.630
And if so, we print a green star,

336
00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:56.540
which stands for an actual star.

337
00:17:56.540 --> 00:17:58.600
And if not, it is a gray star.

338
00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:01.700
So again, which is just an inexistent star.

339
00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:06.120
For example, to show three out of five, okay?

340
00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:08.130
And that probably sounds a bit abstract,

341
00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:10.261
so let's just implement it.

342
00:18:10.261 --> 00:18:15.261
So each star in.

343
00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:17.500
And now we don't have an array yet,

344
00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:19.000
and so we simply create it.

345
00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:23.240
So 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5,

346
00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:25.003
which are all the possible stars.

347
00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:31.160
Next up, let's copy this here.

348
00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:34.380
And now the difference between a green star and a gray one

349
00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:38.210
is that the green has the active modifier here,

350
00:18:38.210 --> 00:18:40.600
and the gray one has inactive.

351
00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:44.280
And so we will change that with a template string, okay?

352
00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:47.880
And so just like before, we actually need this class name

353
00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:51.443
as a class attribute here.

354
00:18:53.850 --> 00:18:54.683
All right.

355
00:18:56.830 --> 00:18:58.470
Then this should also be here.

356
00:18:58.470 --> 00:18:59.743
Let's get rid of this.

357
00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:05.570
And so now let's do that test that we just mentioned.

358
00:19:05.570 --> 00:19:08.650
And again, the output of that will be that this year

359
00:19:08.650 --> 00:19:10.770
is either active or inactive.

360
00:19:10.770 --> 00:19:14.083
And so let's put some JavaScript right at this point.

361
00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:18.090
And so what we're going to do here

362
00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:22.130
is to test if the review.rating,

363
00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:23.930
which is where the rating is stored,

364
00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:28.483
is greater or equal than the current star.

365
00:19:30.010 --> 00:19:33.810
So basically we're writing a turnery operator here.

366
00:19:33.810 --> 00:19:37.233
And so if it is, then here we want to say,

367
00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:40.210
active,

368
00:19:40.210 --> 00:19:41.063
and if not,

369
00:19:43.450 --> 00:19:44.653
then inactive.

370
00:19:46.370 --> 00:19:49.790
And this looks kind of weird, I know.

371
00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:53.530
So let's just exemplify that with a simple example.

372
00:19:53.530 --> 00:19:58.530
So let's say that we have three stars out of five, okay?

373
00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:02.212
So in the first iteration, star is one.

374
00:20:02.212 --> 00:20:06.330
And so one is of course less than three.

375
00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:08.630
And so the first star should, of course,

376
00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:12.360
be a green one, and so that's why here we put out active,

377
00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:16.610
which will then result in reviews_star--active.

378
00:20:16.610 --> 00:20:17.443
Okay?

379
00:20:17.443 --> 00:20:20.910
Then the same thing with the second and the third star.

380
00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:23.320
So at that point we have three green stars.

381
00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:26.410
But the fourth and the fifth one should be gray.

382
00:20:26.410 --> 00:20:27.243
Okay?

383
00:20:27.243 --> 00:20:30.270
And so in the fourth iteration here star is four.

384
00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:33.580
So the test is is three greater than four?

385
00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:36.350
No it's false and so it's inactive.

386
00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:38.820
And so that will then be a gray star,

387
00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:42.683
and the same thing for the last, so the fifth star.

388
00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:47.200
All right, so let's test that.

389
00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:49.480
And actually we cannot test it here,

390
00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:51.410
because this forest hiker

391
00:20:51.410 --> 00:20:53.900
has a perfect five out of five rating

392
00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:57.390
and so all the reviews are five stars.

393
00:20:57.390 --> 00:21:00.490
And so we need to come here to all tours.

394
00:21:00.490 --> 00:21:03.970
And while this link is not really working just yet,

395
00:21:03.970 --> 00:21:07.460
so you see it only edits like this,

396
00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:08.677
this hash here.

397
00:21:08.677 --> 00:21:12.270
And so let's quickly actually go ahead and fix that.

398
00:21:12.270 --> 00:21:15.830
And that is in the header, so right here.

399
00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:17.200
But we don't want that.

400
00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:20.330
We simply want to go to our root page.

401
00:21:20.330 --> 00:21:23.123
So that's just the slash.

402
00:21:24.690 --> 00:21:25.963
So reload.

403
00:21:26.810 --> 00:21:29.340
And now down there in the link you see

404
00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:31.597
that that's exactly what we have.

405
00:21:31.597 --> 00:21:34.853
And so indeed, we get back to our overview page.

406
00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:39.220
So let's go to a page with a lower average.

407
00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:40.843
And so that's the sport lover.

408
00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:43.463
Let's see.

409
00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:46.790
And of course you see that all the data

410
00:21:46.790 --> 00:21:49.410
is now correct for this specific tour.

411
00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:52.190
So again you see this 3.9 average.

412
00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:54.430
You see all these different tour guides,

413
00:21:54.430 --> 00:21:55.823
the different pictures,

414
00:21:56.850 --> 00:21:59.110
and you see all the reviews.

415
00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:03.420
And also you see that the stars are actually working.

416
00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:05.660
So this first review is a five-star review.

417
00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:08.053
And so you see five, four, one,

418
00:22:09.570 --> 00:22:13.633
and then a bunch of four-star reviews down here.

419
00:22:15.290 --> 00:22:20.290
Okay, so, this was a bit more confusing, this part,

420
00:22:20.490 --> 00:22:24.740
but we still managed to get it work, right?

421
00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:27.030
Now one thing that I wanted to just show you

422
00:22:27.030 --> 00:22:29.420
is that we can actually also export,

423
00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:32.490
basically a mixin into its separate file.

424
00:22:32.490 --> 00:22:34.100
And so let's just copy this

425
00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:36.600
and create a new mixin here,

426
00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:37.973
or actually a new file.

427
00:22:39.410 --> 00:22:41.760
And so since we're then going to include it

428
00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:44.343
I will again prefix this with this underscore.

429
00:22:45.610 --> 00:22:49.423
And let's call it reviewCard.pug.

430
00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:52.600
Then paste it here.

431
00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:55.300
And all the indentation is still correct,

432
00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:57.923
and now all we need to do is to say,

433
00:22:59.140 --> 00:22:59.973
include

434
00:23:01.670 --> 00:23:02.670
_reviewCard.

435
00:23:03.850 --> 00:23:06.120
And so if we try that now,

436
00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:09.123
it should still work, which it does.

437
00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:12.230
All right.

438
00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:14.660
So we wrote a lot of code so far

439
00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:16.090
and we're almost done.

440
00:23:16.090 --> 00:23:20.010
All that's left to do is this call to action section.

441
00:23:20.010 --> 00:23:22.360
And here all we really need to change

442
00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:24.340
is this duration here.

443
00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:25.820
So we have this nice slogan like,

444
00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:26.653
10 days.

445
00:23:26.653 --> 00:23:27.520
1 adventure.

446
00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:29.200
Infinite memories.

447
00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:30.240
All right?

448
00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:32.890
But we actually need to replace the number of days

449
00:23:32.890 --> 00:23:35.563
so that it's correct for this particular tour.

450
00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:39.020
So let's create a template string for that.

451
00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:47.720
So tour.duration.

452
00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:52.350
And then also here we have some of the tour images, okay?

453
00:23:52.350 --> 00:23:54.650
So let's do that as well.

454
00:23:54.650 --> 00:23:59.470
So that's image.tours, or /tours and then slash

455
00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:05.200
tour.images.

456
00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:07.430
And remember that this is an array,

457
00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:11.120
and I will simply use the first and the second element.

458
00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:13.010
Or actually the second and the third

459
00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:15.150
'cause I found out that these usually

460
00:24:15.150 --> 00:24:17.223
look a bit better in the situation.

461
00:24:18.530 --> 00:24:20.980
So,

462
00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:23.103
let's copy that.

463
00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:25.833
Put that here.

464
00:24:26.961 --> 00:24:30.480
Oh and we're missing the closing bracket here.

465
00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:32.530
And let's just add some alternative text.

466
00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:34.973
Tour picture.

467
00:24:36.540 --> 00:24:37.500
All right.

468
00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:40.380
And I think that's actually it.

469
00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:42.243
So just one last try.

470
00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:46.203
You see that here it's blank right now.

471
00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:48.223
But now indeed,

472
00:24:49.075 --> 00:24:51.690
we have the same images here.

473
00:24:51.690 --> 00:24:53.313
So this should be number two.

474
00:24:54.450 --> 00:24:57.960
But still, now it says 14 days,

475
00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:00.470
and so all of that is correct now.

476
00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:01.530
Awesome.

477
00:25:01.530 --> 00:25:03.010
That's fantastic.

478
00:25:03.010 --> 00:25:04.920
That was a lot of work,

479
00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:06.610
but I think it really paid off.

480
00:25:06.610 --> 00:25:10.530
This page, I think looks absolutely fantastic.

481
00:25:10.530 --> 00:25:12.200
It's really stunning.

482
00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:14.050
And so now everything is connected.

483
00:25:14.050 --> 00:25:17.260
So on each tour we can go back to all the tours

484
00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:20.100
and take a look at all the other ones.

485
00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:21.960
Let's see the park camper.

486
00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:23.500
The park camper tour.

487
00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:24.540
All the details.

488
00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:26.593
All the different guides, images,

489
00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:32.173
their reviews, and indeed these different images.

490
00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:34.233
Great.

491
00:25:34.233 --> 00:25:38.230
So you see this blank hole here in the middle of our page.

492
00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:40.630
And so that's where the map is going to be next,

493
00:25:40.630 --> 00:25:43.500
and so let's do that, actually right now

494
00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:44.623
in the next lecture.
