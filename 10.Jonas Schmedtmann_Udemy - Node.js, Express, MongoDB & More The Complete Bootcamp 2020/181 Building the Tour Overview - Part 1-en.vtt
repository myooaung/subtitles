00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:02.170
<v Instructor>In this lecture,</v>

2
00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:05.883
we're going to start to really build the tour overview page.

3
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.170
And remember, that this is how

4
00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:11.900
the overview page looks like right now.

5
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.790
So it doesn't have any real content,

6
00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:16.860
and so that's what we're gonna add in this video.

7
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.740
So we're here in this root route, and so again,

8
00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.803
that's where the overview will be, okay?

9
00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.210
So in our view router,

10
00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.650
it is then of course this route, okay?

11
00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.650
And so the controller that is in charge

12
00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.697
of rendering this page is the getoverview controller, okay?

13
00:00:34.697 --> 00:00:37.650
And so let's first go to here,

14
00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:39.840
and lay out the steps that we're going to take

15
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.373
in order to render this page.

16
00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:44.950
So, the first thing that we need to do

17
00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:47.750
is to actually get all the tour data

18
00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:49.273
from our collection, right?

19
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.170
So get tour data

20
00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:56.010
from collection.

21
00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.310
Then second, we're going to build our template

22
00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:01.420
and we're not going to do that here

23
00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.630
in this controller function of course.

24
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.333
But, let's still write it here.

25
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.800
So, build template, and then finally render that template,

26
00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.360
using the tour data from step one.

27
00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.350
So, starting with the first step here

28
00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.930
get the tour data from the collection,

29
00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.013
that means then of course

30
00:01:25.013 --> 00:01:27.413
we first need to actually import the tour model.

31
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.030
So, that's something that we already did

32
00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.513
a lot of times before.

33
00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.340
That's actually one level up,

34
00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.673
and then in models.

35
00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:42.593
and tour model.

36
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.470
And then we're also going to need

37
00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.163
or catchAsync function,

38
00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.290
because then of course

39
00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.513
this get overview will become an asynchronous function.

40
00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:09.190
All right, so let's mark this one as async.

41
00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.120
We now also need next here in order to make

42
00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.123
the catchAsync function actually work.

43
00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.770
Okay, and so I hope that now you actually

44
00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.020
start to see the value of us having built

45
00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.850
all the api stuff and all the codes that we

46
00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.380
have did up to this point, so that all we need to do now

47
00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.680
is to really plug all these pieces together, okay?

48
00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.530
So, we already know now how to do all of this stuff.

49
00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.060
We already have our tour model working correctly.

50
00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.033
So now all of this is very easy.

51
00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:51.880
So const tours is equal to await.

52
00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.620
So again, nothing new at this point.

53
00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.423
And find, all of them basically, all right?

54
00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.700
And now what are we actually going to do

55
00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.960
with this tours data?

56
00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.510
Well, we're going to have to paste all this tour data

57
00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.700
into the template, so that in there we can actually use

58
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.610
and display it on the website, right?

59
00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.910
And so, that's actually very easy to do.

60
00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.300
All we need to do is to put it here in this object

61
00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.200
that is going to get pasted into the overview template

62
00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.770
in this case, okay?

63
00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:28.960
So, very easy, all we need to say is tours.

64
00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.050
So, that's the same as tours equals to tours

65
00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:35.910
and again you already know that starting with ES 6

66
00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.460
it's enough to do it like this.

67
00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.810
Great, so whenever there is now a request

68
00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.860
for the overview page, so basically our homepage

69
00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:49.290
of our dynamically rendered website, all the tour data

70
00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.070
will be retrieved from our database here

71
00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:55.210
and then that data will get pasted into our template.

72
00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:56.920
And so now all we need to do

73
00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.150
is to actually build that template, right?

74
00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.560
So let's move over to overview.pug.

75
00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.270
Here we can actually get rid of this h1 placeholder here.

76
00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:10.410
And, now I want to take a look actually

77
00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.683
at the static html file here again.

78
00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.320
So, that's in the public folder,

79
00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.120
and then overview.html, okay?

80
00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.370
So, we already built the header

81
00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.000
in one of the previous lectures

82
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.780
and so now it's time to build that part here.

83
00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:31.670
Now, when we first built the template,

84
00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:34.450
I actually had it wrong in my html file

85
00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:37.010
and I had section class overview,

86
00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:38.950
but in your starter file you should have had

87
00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:41.410
this main with the class main.

88
00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.430
And, so I believe in your file there's actually

89
00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.240
a small text explaining that, okay?

90
00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.050
But, anyway, we actually deleted that part

91
00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:50.720
from our base template.

92
00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.480
So, remember that,

93
00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.370
that here in the content we actually have no html.

94
00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:57.800
So that main element that in the html

95
00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.510
is right now, nowhere to be found.

96
00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:05.500
And so now we need that in our overview, okay?

97
00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:09.790
So, let's create this part of the html in the overview

98
00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:12.923
because after that we then have all these repeating cards.

99
00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:15.770
So, let's take a look at that as well

100
00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:17.380
before copying the code.

101
00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.450
So, you see that we have these cards here

102
00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:23.340
and so basically, each of these cards,

103
00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:24.990
so each of these elements here,

104
00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:27.000
is what I call one card.

105
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.813
And, so basically we're going to have nine cards.

106
00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:34.490
So, these nine cards on this overview page.

107
00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:37.560
And it's nine cards because right now we have nine tours,

108
00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.080
but of course, it could be less

109
00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.780
or more of these cards, right?

110
00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:45.540
But anyway, what's important to note here

111
00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:48.150
is that these cards actually repeat themselves

112
00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:49.890
over and over again.

113
00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:52.263
So we have this huge card element here.

114
00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.340
And so there's the first one,

115
00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:01.083
and then there are many equal repeating elements afterwards.

116
00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:02.820
Okay?

117
00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:05.920
And so, actually I went ahead and created a pug template

118
00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:07.460
for this card only,

119
00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:10.020
so that we don't have to write it manually now

120
00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.900
and waste a bunch of time doing that, all right?

121
00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:15.660
So that would just make the course unnecessary long

122
00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:18.540
and so I decided to create this template beforehand

123
00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:20.010
for us to use now.

124
00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:22.970
Now of course if you want to practice your pug skills

125
00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:26.010
a bit more, then just feel free to pause the video

126
00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:30.040
at this point and then translate all of this code into pug.

127
00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:30.873
All right?

128
00:06:30.873 --> 00:06:33.410
And when you're done, you can then come back.

129
00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:36.400
But now I will actually go ahead and use that template.

130
00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:39.680
And that's here in dev data and then templates

131
00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:43.630
and tour cards template, okay?

132
00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:46.404
And so that's the entire card for one card,

133
00:06:46.404 --> 00:06:50.333
basically translated to pug code, okay?

134
00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:52.773
So let's copy all of that,

135
00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:58.830
put it here in the overview, okay?

136
00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:01.700
And then let's keep in mind, that before that,

137
00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:05.030
we also need this main and this card container

138
00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:06.630
so let's just copy this as well.

139
00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:12.570
So just here as a reference,

140
00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:15.840
so that we can now write main main

141
00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:21.567
and in there we have a dev called card container.

142
00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:24.703
Okay?

143
00:07:24.703 --> 00:07:27.100
And then as the name says, that container

144
00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:29.533
is going to contain the card.

145
00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:33.240
So now let's indent this, because right now

146
00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:35.720
it's not really inside of the card container.

147
00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:38.490
So right now it would be inside of main

148
00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:39.930
but that's not what we want.

149
00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:42.450
And so, I select everything and hit tab.

150
00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:44.770
I hit tab again, and so now we see

151
00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:45.950
it's at the correct level.

152
00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:47.693
It's inside of the card container.

153
00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:51.820
But actually it's still not 100% correct

154
00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:52.995
because this element

155
00:07:52.995 --> 00:07:56.540
should also be inside of the card element.

156
00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:58.780
And for some reason, copying this template

157
00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:00.600
from one file to the other,

158
00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:03.050
kinda messed this code up a little bit.

159
00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:07.270
And so be careful with that when you paste the code

160
00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:08.830
around like this.

161
00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:11.490
So in our original template, it was all correct

162
00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:13.870
as you see, but then when we copied it,

163
00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:15.023
it kind of messed up.

164
00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:17.760
So, let's close that.

165
00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:19.340
We can actually also close this,

166
00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:21.800
we don't need it anymore, and in fact,

167
00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:25.030
also the base template and the tour template.

168
00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:27.580
So we're only working with the overview now.

169
00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:30.377
And so right now we have this one card here.

170
00:08:30.377 --> 00:08:33.990
And now as you see, it's also a completely static card.

171
00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:35.593
So it doesn't yet use the data

172
00:08:35.593 --> 00:08:38.750
that we pasted into the template, right?

173
00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:42.180
So it has this static image, it has all of this text here,

174
00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:44.660
and it doesn't use the variable at all.

175
00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:46.960
Okay, because that part, I actually wanted

176
00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:48.660
to do together with you.

177
00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:51.440
Because in fact that is the most important part.

178
00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:53.730
So creating all of this template like this

179
00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:56.370
is not difficult and what really matters

180
00:08:56.370 --> 00:09:00.140
is how to actually fill it up with data, okay?

181
00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:02.290
And so that's what we're going to do next.

182
00:09:02.290 --> 00:09:03.760
But for now let's take a look

183
00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:06.409
at how this looks like right now.

184
00:09:06.409 --> 00:09:09.370
Then keep in mind that we should only have one card,

185
00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:11.070
and not nine, okay?

186
00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:14.240
Because again, we have only one static card element

187
00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:15.083
at this point.

188
00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:21.690
Reload this, and that doesn't look so right.

189
00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:24.833
So, let's try to figure out what's going on here.

190
00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:28.083
So we have our main element as we created,

191
00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:31.940
then we have our card container as well.

192
00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:32.970
But then for some reason,

193
00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:34.723
there is a main in there again.

194
00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:40.180
Umm ah okay, I of course need to delete

195
00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:43.223
this original html element that we have there.

196
00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:45.563
So, let's try that again.

197
00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:50.460
And now, now that looks better, okay?

198
00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:52.020
Now the image here is still missing

199
00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:54.340
but never mind about that for now.

200
00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:55.930
What's important is that we got

201
00:09:55.930 --> 00:09:59.570
this nice looking card here, okay?

202
00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:01.360
Now, the thing is that of course we want

203
00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:04.940
to have one card for each of the tours, right?

204
00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:07.220
And so basically, what we want to do now

205
00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:10.343
is to loop through that tours array that we pasted

206
00:10:10.343 --> 00:10:13.070
into the template, right?

207
00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:14.950
So, basically this tours variable.

208
00:10:14.950 --> 00:10:17.250
And keep in mind, that this is an array

209
00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:20.400
because it contains multiple tour documents in it.

210
00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.410
And so let's now loop over this array

211
00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:26.641
and create one card for each of the tour documents, okay?

212
00:10:26.641 --> 00:10:29.420
And luckily, that's very easy to do in pug

213
00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:33.860
because basically pug comes with built in loops, okay?

214
00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:34.960
And so now we can do

215
00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:40.530
each tour in tours, okay?

216
00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:43.970
And so tours here is the variable that we pasted in

217
00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:45.460
and then in each iteration

218
00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:47.830
the current variable will be called tour.

219
00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:52.210
We could call it x or x y z or whatever

220
00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:55.790
but it makes sense to just call it tour, okay?

221
00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:58.810
And so in each iteration what comes then in there

222
00:10:58.810 --> 00:11:01.800
is what will be printed basically.

223
00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:05.363
So this again needs to be indented one more level.

224
00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:08.740
So that basically it is inside

225
00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:11.380
of this loop declaration here.

226
00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:14.753
Great, so let's see how that looks like now.

227
00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:19.380
And so we should now get nine identical cards.

228
00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:24.380
And indeed, that's exactly what happened, all right?

229
00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:25.730
Now of course this data here

230
00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:28.870
is still not created dynamically.

231
00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:30.760
And that is actually exactly what we're going

232
00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:32.373
to fix in the next video.
