1
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:03,610
<v Instructor>We just learned a lot about MVC,</v>

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:06,447
and so lets now very quickly refactor our code

3
00:00:06,447 --> 00:00:09,763
in order to fit that architecture a bit better.

4
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:15,150
And actually we already have our controller folder here,

5
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:18,120
and the tour and user controllers in them,

6
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,040
and we already have the routes

7
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,550
here in the route folder.

8
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:24,540
And so really what we need to do in this video

9
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:26,200
is to create a model folder,

10
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:29,490
and create a tour model in there.

11
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:30,896
So, let's do that.

12
00:00:30,896 --> 00:00:33,590
(clicking)

13
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:35,870
So, models and in there

14
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:40,260
the tourModel.js

15
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:42,733
Let's close out these guys,

16
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:47,500
and so let's go ahead and copy,

17
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,680
or cut actually, this schema

18
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:52,743
and this entire model declaration here,

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,293
and put it in the tour model.

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
We will also want the Mongoose importing here.

21
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:08,070
All right, and in fact,

22
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:11,063
let's get completely rid of this code.

23
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:14,290
All right, so this here was just for testing,

24
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:16,420
and we don't need it anymore.

25
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:18,610
So it has done its job,

26
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:20,110
and so all we really want to do

27
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:23,750
in this file here is to connect to the database,

28
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,360
but everything that is about the models themselves,

29
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:29,120
will always live inside of a file,

30
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,893
inside of the models folder.

31
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,640
All right, now in here eslint tells us

32
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,452
that this variable here has not been used,

33
00:01:36,452 --> 00:01:38,400
but actually we want to use it

34
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,823
because we want to export the model from this file.

35
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,150
So module.exports, and this should actually

36
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:50,530
be the only thing we export from this file,

37
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:54,590
and so we use the kind of default export with module.exports

38
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:59,340
Okay, and so this is our very simple tour model

39
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,300
that we created in our last lecture,

40
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:04,290
and now here we put it in it's own standalone file,

41
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:07,100
and then finally exported it from here.

42
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:10,670
Okay, now where do we actually need this tour.

43
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:13,290
So, in other words, where are we actually going to create

44
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:16,850
and query, and delete and update tours.

45
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:20,643
Well we're going to do so in the tourController, right?

46
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,350
So right here,

47
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:27,233
and so let's go ahead and actually import the model in here.

48
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,436
So right here at the top,

49
00:02:30,436 --> 00:02:32,540
(clicking)

50
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,583
and I'm giving it the exact same name.

51
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,720
So still tour,

52
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:42,260
and now I want to require, so the current folder,

53
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:44,250
then up one folder,

54
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:47,163
and then down into the models folder,

55
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:50,623
and in there, tour model.

56
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:55,220
Okay, now of course it's telling me

57
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,960
that I'm not using this variable,

58
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,020
but don't worry about that for now.

59
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:01,020
So, next up, I want to get rid

60
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:04,790
of this place here where we actually import

61
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:06,580
the data as a json file.

62
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,660
So, of course, we no longer need this.

63
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:10,960
This here was just for testing purposes.

64
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,080
So let's get rid of it.

65
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,770
You can also comment it out

66
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:18,540
if you want to leave it maybe as a reference for yourself.

67
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:20,903
Then just go ahead and comment it out.

68
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:24,210
Then down here we get this error

69
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:26,480
because the variable that we just deleted

70
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,280
is no longer defined,

71
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,410
and so let me comment out this piece of code here

72
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:35,363
because, again, we're gonna need something similar to this.

73
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:39,900
Okay, get tour, let's comment all

74
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:44,330
of this here out as well just so that we don't get

75
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:48,060
any errors as soon as we save this file.

76
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,240
Then here, actually, we can get rid,

77
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,400
well kind of, of all of this.

78
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,210
So we're no longer gonna use any of this.

79
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:57,010
So let me just keep this piece here.

80
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,130
So I'm gonna copy it,

81
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:01,780
delete everything else from this,

82
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,240
and put it back here.

83
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,610
We still got this error,

84
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:09,693
and so I'm commenting out this piece of code.

85
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:12,950
All right, and here we don't get any errors.

86
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:15,693
So let's just leave it like this for now, okay?

87
00:04:15,693 --> 00:04:18,210
So what I just did here was to basically

88
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:20,800
clean the code that we wrote before

89
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,040
in order to no longer depend on the data

90
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,853
that we had in the json file.

91
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:28,990
All right, so now we should have no more errors,

92
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:32,190
or actually we should in this checkID function,

93
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:33,930
and this checkID function, we,

94
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:37,070
in fact, no longer will need it, okay?

95
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:39,460
Because from now on we're gonna start working

96
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:42,930
with the IDs that are coming from MongoDB,

97
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:45,540
and Mongo itself will give us an error

98
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:48,046
if we use an invalid ID,

99
00:04:48,046 --> 00:04:50,800
and so this function that we have here

100
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,260
was actually very useful for showing you

101
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,940
how middleware actually works,

102
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:57,930
by giving you this very practical example here,

103
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,090
and later in the course, people,

104
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,830
of course, use more middleware,

105
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:02,660
but this particular function here,

106
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,450
we will no longer need it.

107
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:06,234
So, let's get rid of it,

108
00:05:06,234 --> 00:05:09,870
and also of this file system import,

109
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:13,170
again, because we're no longer using the file here.

110
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:14,450
So we still got some error here.

111
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:16,120
Let's see what's happening,

112
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,140
and it looks like it is in the

113
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:21,210
in the tour routes, okay?

114
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:22,250
And so actually that was the one

115
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:23,853
that I was gonna change next.

116
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:26,710
So the problem here is that

117
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:30,780
this tourController.checkID, of course no longer

118
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:33,077
exists because we just deleted it,

119
00:05:33,077 --> 00:05:35,780
and so let's get rid of this as well,

120
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:38,930
or actually let me just comment it out, okay?

121
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:41,000
So you keep in mind that you can use

122
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,580
this .param function here to define

123
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:47,190
parameter middleware in your own applications, okay?

124
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,820
So I don't want you to forget that,

125
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:51,060
and so just leave it here in your code

126
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,120
so that maybe later when you come back to it

127
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,270
you still know that it's there, okay?

128
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,520
So now I saved it,

129
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,120
and so we're back on track here.

130
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,860
So everything is back to working,

131
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:04,800
and our code is now sufficiently well refactored

132
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,880
so that in the next video we can actually start

133
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,343
implementing the correct functions in our API.

134
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,450
So basically, getting all tours,

135
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:18,120
creating tours, deleting tours, and updating tours.

136
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,420
So, one by one, we will start

137
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,380
implementing these controller functions,

138
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:24,040
or handler functions if you prefer that,

139
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,743
starting in the next video.
