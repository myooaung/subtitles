00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:02.870
<v Instructor>So in this video, we're gonna use</v>

2
00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:07.100
the power of Pug to create a really nice email template

3
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.893
and then send a welcome email based on that template.

4
00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.710
And that template is welcome.pug here.

5
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.410
Okay, now just as before, I already have a template

6
00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.973
here in dev-data templates.

7
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.240
So email template and so it's all of this code here

8
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.990
with the CSS also in lined.

9
00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:34.403
So a ton of CSS.

10
00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.563
So let's copy all of that here into welcome.pug.

11
00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.200
Okay, and here up in the bottom, you'll see this note

12
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.850
where I say that it actually adapted this email template

13
00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.053
from this one.

14
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.483
So let's very quickly open that.

15
00:00:54.511 --> 00:00:55.344
All right.

16
00:00:55.344 --> 00:00:58.813
And so our email is going to look a bit like this one.

17
00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:03.590
Now, of course, I adapted the design a bit to our brand.

18
00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.430
So for this button here,

19
00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.783
I used our green color, for example.

20
00:01:09.848 --> 00:01:13.600
But kind of what I used is this HTML template.

21
00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.820
Then I actually converted that HTML using this tool.

22
00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.763
So HTML to Pug.

23
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.950
So again, let's take a quick look at that.

24
00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.260
And so basically what this allows you to do

25
00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.030
is to paste some HTML in here

26
00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.660
then click Convert and it will output the Pug code for you.

27
00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.170
So that can be very handy when you try to convert

28
00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.263
some existing pages that you already have an HTML to Pug.

29
00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:47.810
Anyway, when we're building an HTML email,

30
00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.350
we always need to inline all the styles.

31
00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.290
And so that's why you have this ton of CSS

32
00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:55.240
right here inside this file.

33
00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.000
But, of course, this makes this file a bit noisy

34
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.213
and so let's grab all of that and export it.

35
00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.810
All right, so, yeah.

36
00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:05.703
So that's it.

37
00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:07.443
So cut it,

38
00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.720
and here create a new file,

39
00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.520
and then, just as before, with files that I'm gonna include,

40
00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.827
I use the underscore then style.pug.

41
00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.710
So paste that here.

42
00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.450
And now we need to also adjust all this insetting here

43
00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.210
and so again, Command + Shift + P

44
00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:32.820
or probably on Windows, Ctrl + Shift + P.

45
00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.823
And then just write pug for beautify pug.

46
00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.053
And so that makes our code nice.

47
00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:41.623
Close that one up here,

48
00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:43.973
and now include_style.

49
00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.730
Okay, and now you see all of these codes down here,

50
00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.750
which looks really confusing and that's actually the reason

51
00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.400
why I copied this template from that GitHub repo

52
00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.680
that I showed you before.

53
00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.160
So there's a lot of tables going on

54
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.080
and that's because many email clients

55
00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.410
actually only understand tables for formatting.

56
00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.800
So we have all these stuff here that's not really meaningful

57
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.350
with table rows inside of tables inside of tables.

58
00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:16.600
Am I right?

59
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.720
But what matters here is this content area here.

60
00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.440
And so this is the part of the template

61
00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.340
where we're gonna put all our content.

62
00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.370
Now, the thing is that we, of course,

63
00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.370
will have many different templates.

64
00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:30.600
In the case of this project,

65
00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.930
we will actually only create two ourselves

66
00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.410
but there might be many emails for many situations

67
00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:39.610
and so, of course, we will need a way of reusing

68
00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:42.840
all of these code that is outside of this content.

69
00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.200
So, basically, all of these here should be reusable,

70
00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.050
and actually, that's exactly what we did before

71
00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:50.853
with our base template here.

72
00:03:52.352 --> 00:03:53.185
All right.

73
00:03:53.185 --> 00:03:56.450
So we put everything that is reusable for all the templates

74
00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.540
inside of this base, then we have our block there

75
00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.150
and all the other templates,

76
00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.200
then simply extend this block.

77
00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.280
And so that is exactly what we will do now.

78
00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:12.240
So let's actually go ahead and cut all of these from here,

79
00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.517
create a new template called baseEmail,

80
00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.623
and then put that here.

81
00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.550
And now, for the content itself, of course,

82
00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.100
we remove that from the base.

83
00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:31.773
So cut that one from here,

84
00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.550
and here let's create then a block

85
00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.423
called content, again.

86
00:04:39.101 --> 00:04:39.934
All right.

87
00:04:39.934 --> 00:04:43.900
And so now here, in our welcome template,

88
00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.600
we then put that content

89
00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:49.883
inside that content block.

90
00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:51.870
Okay.

91
00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.750
And now just to finish, we then need to say

92
00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.190
that it extends, so that this template here

93
00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:00.187
extends the baseEmail.

94
00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.470
Let's format this again with this command

95
00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:10.670
and that's beautiful.

96
00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:11.503
Great.

97
00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:14.830
Now, here in our base template,

98
00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:18.620
we actually have now the subject as the title.

99
00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:20.780
And so that is the reason why I passed that

100
00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:23.023
into the template.

101
00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:27.030
So that is right here, remember?

102
00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:29.829
So into the template, we passed the subject,

103
00:05:29.829 --> 00:05:32.140
the URL and the firstName.

104
00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:35.980
And so let's now go ahead and use this in our template.

105
00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:39.470
And so the subject we already used here in the base

106
00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:42.120
but that's actually it for this file

107
00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.363
so we're not going to touch it again.

108
00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:48.540
And so now here is our real template.

109
00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:53.540
So we have here the name and so let's actually replace that

110
00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:55.893
with the first name variable.

111
00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:03.840
So firstName here, then we have all these nice texts here.

112
00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:07.550
So, welcome to the family, all that stuff.

113
00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:10.150
And then down here we have that green button

114
00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:13.370
that I talked about when I showed you the template on GitHub

115
00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:17.220
and so on that button, we say upload user photo.

116
00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:22.043
And so here we need to specify that URL that we passed in.

117
00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:31.380
All right, so it's called URL, right.

118
00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:35.290
And so, now we put that on this button here

119
00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:36.720
and that's actually it.

120
00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.440
All of the rest here is just static content

121
00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:43.130
that we do not need to change at all, all right?

122
00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:47.470
So this welcome template here will now get used

123
00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:49.790
whenever we call sendWelcome.

124
00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:53.130
And so let's now actually go ahead and do that.

125
00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:57.190
So from where do we want to send the welcome email?

126
00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:00.540
Well, that is in the authController

127
00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:03.800
and to, I believe there's a sign up function

128
00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:05.663
or register or something like that,

129
00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:08.430
and it's right here.

130
00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:10.240
So this sign up.

131
00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:13.130
And so into this, we need to import the email

132
00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:14.093
and then use it.

133
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.760
And, actually, already we have sendEmail,

134
00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:21.990
but now remember that is called Email,

135
00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:24.533
so with a capital E like this.

136
00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:29.980
Now we used that variable before somewhere down here,

137
00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:30.973
so let's go there.

138
00:07:33.438 --> 00:07:35.750
All right, and so this code here at this point

139
00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:39.520
is no longer working but we will fix that in the next video.

140
00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:41.440
So for now, let's just comment it out

141
00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:45.983
so that it doesn't do any damage.

142
00:07:48.409 --> 00:07:51.960
But anyway, let's now use this email class right here.

143
00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:04.060
So new Email, and then remember first up is the user

144
00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:08.700
and actually VS code knows that and shows that here

145
00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:12.890
and so user is the newUser that we have up here

146
00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:19.803
and then the URL that we're gonna create here in a second.

147
00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:27.150
So const url equals, let's put it to zero, for now.

148
00:08:30.315 --> 00:08:32.565
Okay, and then sendWelcome.

149
00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:39.050
And now all we need to do is to actually await

150
00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:40.783
this sendWelcome function.

151
00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:45.980
All right, so we do that, that we only move on here

152
00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:49.923
to the next step after the email has actually been sent.

153
00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:52.910
And we can do that, of course,

154
00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:57.233
because sendWelcome is an async function, remember that.

155
00:08:58.100 --> 00:08:59.750
And so when we actually use it,

156
00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:02.163
we then wait until it finishes.

157
00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:05.960
All right, and so this is all we need to do

158
00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:08.170
in order to send emails now,

159
00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:12.270
but we still need to specify our URL here.

160
00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:15.110
Now, what URL do we actually want here?

161
00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:17.200
Well, remember that here on the button,

162
00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:20.910
it says Upload_user_photo, right?

163
00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:22.540
And so basically, we want to point

164
00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:24.603
to that user account page.

165
00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:29.600
So, basically, right here.

166
00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:33.833
So for now, let's copy it, but we will then change it.

167
00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:37.100
And we could leave it like this

168
00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:39.640
but then it would only work in development

169
00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:42.510
and not production, 'cause, of course,

170
00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:45.720
this here does not exist when we're in production.

171
00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:49.140
And so instead of basically hard coding it like this,

172
00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:51.373
we will get this data from the request.

173
00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:56.830
So basically, we will get what protocol we're using,

174
00:09:56.830 --> 00:10:01.830
if we're using HTTP or HTTPS, and then also this host.

175
00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:06.920
Okay, and both of that we can get from the request.

176
00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:09.350
So let's replace all of these here

177
00:10:11.237 --> 00:10:12.830
and make this a template string

178
00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:18.590
and then we can say request.protocol

179
00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.193
then colon, slash, slash,

180
00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:30.580
and then request.get.

181
00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:32.710
So we need to use this getter function

182
00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:35.653
and what we want to get is the host.

183
00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:38.670
And so when we're in development,

184
00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:41.750
then, of course, this here will be the local host

185
00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:43.263
on port 3000.

186
00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:47.790
Okay so let's just console it

187
00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:52.703
just to make sure.

188
00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:57.460
Okay, and now, let's actually then test it.

189
00:10:57.460 --> 00:11:00.723
And all we need to do for that is to just create a new user.

190
00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:04.543
So let's do that here in Postman.

191
00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:07.943
So Sign Up,

192
00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:13.860
and now in our Body, let's create a new name,

193
00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:15.223
let's say Test User.

194
00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:20.280
And here, all of these doesn't really matter,

195
00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:22.767
so let's just say test@natours.io

196
00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:28.110
and with the same standard password.

197
00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:31.600
And so now when we create this new user,

198
00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:34.850
then we should get a new email into our Mailtrap,

199
00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:36.513
so that we can take a look at it.

200
00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:41.583
So let's try that and we got some nice error down here.

201
00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:44.560
So let's take a look at that.

202
00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:48.200
And it says that it couldn't find this file.

203
00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:52.373
So there's some error in our email handler here.

204
00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:56.353
And so let's try to find where that is.

205
00:11:57.794 --> 00:11:59.003
Ah, it's down here.

206
00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:02.160
And so the problem is that the folder here

207
00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:05.113
is called email and here I called it emails.

208
00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:09.340
So let's just say email,

209
00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:10.850
I prefer that one.

210
00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:12.263
And so now it should work.

211
00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:15.400
Oh, and now we get the next error,

212
00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:18.160
because this email here already exists.

213
00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:20.210
And that's because in the previous step,

214
00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:22.900
we actually did create the error, the only problem

215
00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:24.740
was then with sending the email.

216
00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:27.303
So let's do that again here, test two.

217
00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:31.500
And one more error.

218
00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:35.220
This time coming directly from Pug.

219
00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:39.320
So, only named blocks and mixins can appear at the top level

220
00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:40.763
of an extending template.

221
00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:44.203
And so something is wrong here,

222
00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:47.490
and indeed it is.

223
00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:49.573
So that's actually exactly the error

224
00:12:49.573 --> 00:12:53.630
that it told us we had and that is we can only have extends

225
00:12:53.630 --> 00:12:56.020
and block but here we have this paragraph

226
00:12:56.020 --> 00:12:58.540
also at the top level.

227
00:12:58.540 --> 00:12:59.920
So that's not allowed.

228
00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:03.503
So let's put it where it belongs, which is right here.

229
00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:09.020
Give that a save, try it one more time,

230
00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:11.300
and of course now we get this error.

231
00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:12.873
So let's say test three.

232
00:13:18.011 --> 00:13:20.310
Okay, now we're good to go.

233
00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:22.670
So we successfully created the new user,

234
00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:23.980
he has logged in.

235
00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:26.480
And now let's take a look at Mailtrap

236
00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:28.823
to see if we actually got our email.

237
00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:31.473
So Mailtrap.

238
00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:35.963
Let me log in here real quick.

239
00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:40.030
And here is our Natours inbox,

240
00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:43.450
and indeed, here is this new email from a minute ago

241
00:13:43.450 --> 00:13:46.300
saying welcome to the Natours family.

242
00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:47.170
Great.

243
00:13:47.170 --> 00:13:50.560
And it actually looks really nice, right?

244
00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:53.630
So that's all the texts that we had in our template.

245
00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:56.313
We can also see the complete HTML here.

246
00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:01.330
Also here we have the text.

247
00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:03.940
And so remember that we created this one here

248
00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:06.130
from the HTML to text package

249
00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:09.443
and so we can confirm that it works just fine as well.

250
00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:12.850
And, uh, yeah.

251
00:14:12.850 --> 00:14:15.333
Let's just try to click here on this button,

252
00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:20.450
and indeed it takes us to our account page.

253
00:14:20.450 --> 00:14:23.740
Now, right now we're actually logged in as Aarav

254
00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:27.010
because we already were logged in as that user

255
00:14:27.010 --> 00:14:28.680
but that's not really the point

256
00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:31.200
because this email here kind of supposes

257
00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:34.560
that you are signing up from the website, right?

258
00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:36.420
Now, that doesn't work at this point,

259
00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:39.510
so we don't have any sign up form on our website

260
00:14:39.510 --> 00:14:41.850
but the really important part here

261
00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:45.980
is that our email here now works just fine,

262
00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:47.800
the button here also works.

263
00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:49.620
And so that big email handler

264
00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:52.710
that we created in the last lecture is doing its job

265
00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:54.860
just as well as the email template

266
00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:56.660
that we created in this video.

267
00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:59.090
So, I'm really happy with this result.

268
00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:01.300
Next up, let's do something similar

269
00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:03.223
for the password reset emails.
