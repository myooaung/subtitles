1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:03,170
<v ->In this video and the next one,</v>

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:06,540
together we're gonna build the tour detail page.

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:07,500
And along the way

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,930
you're gonna learn some more Pug techniques

5
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:12,107
like conditionals and mixins.

6
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,840
And as I showed you before,

7
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:19,760
this is what the tour detail page actually looks like.

8
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,590
And so that's what we're going to build in this video

9
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:24,640
and the next one.

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,180
Now the only thing that we're gonna leave

11
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:27,550
for a bit later

12
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:29,490
is actually this map.

13
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:31,060
All right, but everything else

14
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:33,760
we're going to build in these tool lectures.

15
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,873
Including these reviews.

16
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:39,070
All right.

17
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:41,830
So right now we have our overview

18
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:43,350
and we have of course

19
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:46,270
these buttons with the URLs already created.

20
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:49,430
But then when we try to access this page

21
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:51,380
we of course get this error.

22
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:52,380
All right.

23
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:55,170
So let's go back to our VS code

24
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:57,470
and I actually want to start this

25
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:59,650
with a small challenge for you.

26
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:00,820
So what I want you to do

27
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:03,310
is to create a route for the detail page

28
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:06,180
according to the URL that we just built before.

29
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,370
And it's going to be similar

30
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:09,100
to what we already have here

31
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,640
but you have to tweak it a little bit.

32
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,473
Okay.

33
00:01:12,473 --> 00:01:13,306
Enough of that,

34
00:01:13,306 --> 00:01:16,120
I also want you to build this controller.

35
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,530
So get to it.

36
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:19,370
'Cause right now we only have

37
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:20,910
like this place holder.

38
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:23,410
And so let me actually give you the steps here.

39
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:25,130
And so as always,

40
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:26,660
first,

41
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:29,120
we need to get the data.

42
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,093
This time for the requested tour.

43
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,313
And for that,

44
00:01:35,313 --> 00:01:37,360
keep in mind that we actually need the reviews here

45
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,693
and also the tour guides.

46
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:44,503
Okay.

47
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:46,723
So,

48
00:01:46,723 --> 00:01:48,700
again let's take a look at that.

49
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:51,140
So we have these tour guides here.

50
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:54,230
Right, and so they are a separate data set basically.

51
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:55,550
So users.

52
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:57,933
And then here we also have the reviews.

53
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:00,730
Now these tour guides here,

54
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:03,330
I believe they're actually automatically populated

55
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:04,400
in a model.

56
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,930
So let's take a look at that very quick.

57
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:08,270
So the tour model

58
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:11,450
and so,

59
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:12,283
yeah.

60
00:02:12,283 --> 00:02:13,116
So down here,

61
00:02:13,116 --> 00:02:14,400
we have this auto populate

62
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,600
whenever there is a find query

63
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,070
but only for the guides.

64
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:20,160
And so don't forget to also populate

65
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,173
the reviews.

66
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:23,450
Okay.

67
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:24,513
Then after that,

68
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,120
we will build a template

69
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,670
but that we will do together okay,

70
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:31,470
so I don't need you to do this part.

71
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,220
And then finally,

72
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:38,030
I want you to complete this part here as well.

73
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:38,950
So render

74
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:41,203
template

75
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:43,510
using the data

76
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:47,050
from step one again.

77
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:48,580
All right.

78
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:50,120
So that's very simple as well.

79
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,300
And so what I want you to do

80
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,870
is to create the route

81
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:54,410
and then also get the data.

82
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:57,763
Okay so pause the video here and good luck with that.

83
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,280
So I hope you did that

84
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,950
and to let me know, solve it here for you.

85
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:08,090
And we're gonna start with the route.

86
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:11,360
And now all we actually need to add here is this slug.

87
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,510
And of course, we're doing that as a URL parameter.

88
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:17,693
So just like this, calling it slug.

89
00:03:18,885 --> 00:03:21,150
So before we use the ID right?

90
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,660
And so we had it like this

91
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:25,480
and now let's just call it the slug.

92
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,313
All right.

93
00:03:26,313 --> 00:03:27,146
Because again,

94
00:03:27,146 --> 00:03:29,560
that is what the overview page looks like.

95
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,413
We have tour slash slug basically.

96
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,100
Okay, and so that's what we will then use

97
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:39,460
to create for the tour in the controller.

98
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,500
So let's do that now here.

99
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,363
So const,

100
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:44,460
tour

101
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:45,910
equal

102
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:46,743
await

103
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,633
tour

104
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:53,440
and findone.

105
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,540
So this time we cannot use find by ID.

106
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:58,330
Well because, we do not know

107
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:00,130
the ID of the tour.

108
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:01,030
And so instead,

109
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:04,040
we are searching by the slug.

110
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,140
And the slug is

111
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:07,540
as I hope you know

112
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,940
request.params

113
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:11,060
dot

114
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:11,893
slug

115
00:04:11,893 --> 00:04:12,960
all right.

116
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,180
And now finally, that's all to populate

117
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:18,263
the arrays field.

118
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:20,223
All right.

119
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:24,063
So the path to populate is reviews.

120
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,690
And actually we do not need all the fields here.

121
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:29,890
So let's just specify the ones that we need.

122
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:32,480
And so,

123
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,023
that is only the review,

124
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,113
the rating,

125
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:38,450
and the user.

126
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:39,283
Because remember

127
00:04:39,283 --> 00:04:40,600
that we actually display

128
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,490
so the user name and the user photo.

129
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:45,460
And then of course,

130
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:47,873
the review itself and the rating.

131
00:04:50,065 --> 00:04:50,898
Okay.

132
00:04:50,898 --> 00:04:51,910
Then of course,

133
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:54,604
it's complaining that we didn't use async.

134
00:04:54,604 --> 00:04:56,763
And of course I wasn't gonna forget that.

135
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,300
But anyway it's good

136
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:02,290
that ES Line warns us about this kind of errors.

137
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:04,660
It really takes away a lot of bugs

138
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,353
from development.

139
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,713
Okay.

140
00:05:08,713 --> 00:05:09,770
And then here of course

141
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:12,030
we're going to pass that tour variable

142
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:14,660
into our tour template.

143
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,240
So that one.

144
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,380
Give it a save.

145
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:19,010
No more errors.

146
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:21,590
And so that part is actually now complete.

147
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:22,940
And so all we need to do now

148
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:26,420
is to go ahead and build our template.

149
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,730
Okay.

150
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:28,940
So,

151
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,920
we already should have that here.

152
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,193
And that's the dev data.

153
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:34,230
So we have a lot of folders

154
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:35,490
and a lot of data.

155
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:37,370
And it can become a bit

156
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,090
confusing at some point.

157
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:39,923
Okay.

158
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:40,923
And so,

159
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:45,310
let's get rid of this placeholder content here.

160
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:47,510
And before we do anything else,

161
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:51,690
let's again take a look at the original HTML file.

162
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:53,510
Which is in that

163
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:55,900
public folder that I just closed.

164
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:58,080
Let's actually close all of these here,

165
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,980
'cause I find this really confusing.

166
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:05,470
Okay, the models as well.

167
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:08,290
And so now what we need is public

168
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:09,893
and then tour.html.

169
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,950
So the header we already have of course.

170
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:16,970
And then here goes all the content.

171
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:17,803
So,

172
00:06:17,803 --> 00:06:18,880
all of these sections

173
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,070
that we have on our page

174
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:23,110
are of course translated here as HTML.

175
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:24,360
And just like before,

176
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,830
I actually already created a Pug template

177
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:30,649
based on all of this HTML code.

178
00:06:30,649 --> 00:06:33,390
All right, we wouldn't want to translate

179
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:35,630
this here manually together.

180
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:36,640
Okay.

181
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:40,050
So I have it here already in this template file.

182
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:40,883
But of course,

183
00:06:40,883 --> 00:06:42,630
again, if you feel like it,

184
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:44,020
you can pause the video now

185
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:46,113
and translate this on your own as well.

186
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:47,843
All right.

187
00:06:47,843 --> 00:06:49,870
But what I'm going to do now is to

188
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:51,850
go ahead and copy all of this code.

189
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:54,933
Which is still a ton of code as you can see.

190
00:06:56,310 --> 00:07:00,270
So let's copy all of this and go into our tour

191
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:02,090
and paste that here.

192
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:05,240
Now the annotation is going to be wrong again.

193
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,920
So let's copy, or actually select what we just pasted here.

194
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,990
And so everything except the first line is incorrect.

195
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:14,490
But all we need to do here is to add one more tab.

196
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,910
And that's it.

197
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:20,420
So now they're all inside of this content block

198
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,720
all at the same level.

199
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,920
So section

200
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,980
and section

201
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:26,410
and so basically all of the sections

202
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:27,700
are now at the same level,

203
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,570
so they're all siblings.

204
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:30,403
Great.

205
00:07:30,403 --> 00:07:32,650
So let's just close up all of these

206
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:33,973
we no longer need.

207
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,070
And so just like before,

208
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:38,150
we now have this static page here

209
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:40,120
with all of this static data.

210
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:43,310
Which we know we'll have to go ahead an replace.

211
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:44,700
But before actually doing that,

212
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,960
let's just take a look if our route

213
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,173
is already working.

214
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:50,840
Okay.

215
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,600
So let's reload it

216
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,700
and that gives us the same error.

217
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:55,690
And I guess that's because

218
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:56,970
here we have tours

219
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:58,720
and not tour

220
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,673
as I think we have it in our route.

221
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:04,800
Right so here we have tour.

222
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,560
And that actually is the way it makes sense.

223
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,443
And so let's go ahead and change that here in our

224
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,313
overview.

225
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:14,950
Okay and so here

226
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:16,670
we actually want tour.

227
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:17,680
'Cause in fact,

228
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,950
we're actually only seeing one tour

229
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:21,333
and not multiple tours.

230
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,570
Right?

231
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:25,800
And so if we go back to the overview now,

232
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,940
we load it,

233
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,800
and now open up The Forest Hiker,

234
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,500
then you see that it's going to be tour.

235
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,420
And then of course,

236
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:35,533
we get the HTML for the page

237
00:08:35,533 --> 00:08:38,160
that we just created.

238
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:41,360
Now for some reason the CSS is not here.

239
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,860
Let's just try to reload this.

240
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:46,100
Well, what's going on here?

241
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,340
Let's try to inspect this.

242
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:50,440
And I see we have a couple of errors.

243
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,510
So we can click on that.

244
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:55,000
And so the reason for the missing CSS,

245
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,630
because instead it's trying to load the file

246
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:58,640
in the wrong place.

247
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,320
So it's trying to load it in the CSS folder

248
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,310
inside of tour.

249
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:04,890
But that of course does not exist.

250
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:05,950
And so that is because

251
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:08,430
we're here on this tour route, okay.

252
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:10,230
And so we need to basically fix

253
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:13,493
the way that we import the CSS in our base template.

254
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:16,113
Let's go there.

255
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,950
And so here in fact,

256
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:23,070
we should have another slash.

257
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:25,010
Okay, and the same actually here.

258
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:25,910
And so that's

259
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:27,153
for the exact same reason

260
00:09:27,153 --> 00:09:30,770
that I explained to you before in the overview down here.

261
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:33,930
So we started this URL as well with a slash.

262
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:36,260
And so again, that is then going to start

263
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:38,120
at the root of the page.

264
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,350
And that's the way it's supposed to work.

265
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:43,470
And in fact, the same applies to all of the images here.

266
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:45,630
So all the images should always

267
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:49,080
also start relative to the root URL.

268
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:52,030
So let's add that very quickly here to all of these images.

269
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,633
And,

270
00:09:55,633 --> 00:09:56,590
yeah, that's it.

271
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:57,723
So that's all of them.

272
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,813
And so,

273
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:02,810
with that we've fixed the overview

274
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:06,210
and also this base file.

275
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:07,950
So if we now reload,

276
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:11,610
we should then get access to the correct CSS.

277
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:13,610
And indeed, here we go.

278
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:15,000
There is just one more error

279
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,610
which is here in this image.

280
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:17,480
And so again,

281
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,390
it's because it's trying to load it here

282
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:20,830
from the tour

283
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:22,830
and not from the root URL.

284
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:23,663
And so,

285
00:10:23,663 --> 00:10:25,563
that problem is here in the header.

286
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:27,873
And so of course,

287
00:10:27,873 --> 00:10:29,770
here we also need to make it relative

288
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:31,700
to the root path.

289
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,853
Probably the same in the footer.

290
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:35,783
And yeah.

291
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,033
All right.

292
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,960
Just to quickly confirm that,

293
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,573
yeah indeed, here we go.

294
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,350
Great.

295
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:47,830
So as I mentioned of course,

296
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:49,890
this has all the static data

297
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:52,380
about The Park Camper Tour

298
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:54,650
which is the one that we have in the template.

299
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:57,140
But we are looking at the forest hiker.

300
00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:01,060
And so, let's now start by fixing our template

301
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:04,663
and basically using the dynamic data right in here.

302
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:10,720
So, remember that the variable that we passed in here

303
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,053
is called tour.

304
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:14,043
Right?

305
00:11:14,043 --> 00:11:15,480
So it's simply called tour

306
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,100
and so that's what we have to call it here.

307
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:18,933
So tour

308
00:11:19,997 --> 00:11:20,883
.name,

309
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,600
and also the same up here.

310
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,630
And now you already know that

311
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:26,840
we need to use a template string here

312
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,993
because we in fact want to create a string.

313
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,463
So named .tour.

314
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:36,543
And here this path is also not correct.

315
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,530
First of all it needs to be a template string

316
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:42,250
and then our images,

317
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:45,000
I'll write image slash tours

318
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,983
slash the name of the cover image.

319
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,330
So tour

320
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:56,880
dot, and now I don't remember if it's image cover,

321
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,933
or cover image.

322
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,080
So,

323
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,160
yeah.

324
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:01,993
Image cover.

325
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:04,613
Okay.

326
00:12:04,613 --> 00:12:07,140
So let's quickly try that out.

327
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:09,830
And so remember, we're at The First Hiker.

328
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:11,580
And so that should now be the name.

329
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:14,480
And yet another error.

330
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,450
So,

331
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:19,310
it says here, cannot read property tour of undefined.

332
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:21,020
So let's go back and

333
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:22,770
yeah.

334
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:25,940
So here is this stupid mistake.

335
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:27,900
So it's of course tour.name

336
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:30,420
and not name.tour.

337
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,290
So,

338
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:32,663
what was I thinking there?

339
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:34,910
Let's reload this

340
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:37,820
and now indeed, we get The Forest Hiker

341
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:41,980
with this real nice cover image in the background.

342
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:42,813
Great.

343
00:12:42,813 --> 00:12:44,373
And let's keep moving here.

344
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:47,723
So create yet another template string.

345
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:50,813
Tour.

346
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,343
Duration,

347
00:12:55,421 --> 00:12:57,680
and then the number of days.

348
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,560
Then down here,

349
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,303
we have again the start location.

350
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:03,930
So,

351
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:05,570
tour.start

352
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,643
location.description, remember.

353
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,520
All right.

354
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,070
Now down here

355
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:16,220
we have these overview boxes here.

356
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:18,110
So overview box detail.

357
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:19,100
And as you see,

358
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,660
we have four equal boxes here

359
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:23,530
where the only thing that changes

360
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:25,687
is this icon name,

361
00:13:25,687 --> 00:13:28,810
then the date and the next date.

362
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:29,643
Okay,

363
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:32,140
so here what changes is not the next date,

364
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:34,210
what changes is the description of the boxes.

365
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:36,540
So next date, difficulty,

366
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,500
participants and rating.

367
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,350
All right.

368
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:40,260
And so basically,

369
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:42,550
this code here is always the same

370
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:44,710
only with three pieces that change.

371
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:46,100
So the name of the icon,

372
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:49,560
the description and the value of that description.

373
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,393
And so,

374
00:13:50,393 --> 00:13:53,510
since we don't like repeated code, right?

375
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:56,070
Let's use another feature of Pug

376
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:57,410
that we haven't used yet

377
00:13:57,410 --> 00:13:59,500
which is called mixins.

378
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:03,060
So mixins are basically reusable pieces of code

379
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:05,060
that we can pass arguments into.

380
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:06,940
So a bit like a function.

381
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:10,400
And also it's exactly like mixins in SAS.

382
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,460
So that's a CSS pre processor

383
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:14,370
that you might be familiar with.

384
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:17,950
So let's copy this code here for this overview box.

385
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:19,200
So copying it.

386
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:22,240
And now out here, out of this block,

387
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,353
let's then create a new mixin.

388
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:29,140
So we write mixin and then the name of the mixin,

389
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,793
which I'm calling overview box.

390
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,200
And then a bit like a function,

391
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,200
we can specify some arguments.

392
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:41,430
And so remember how we have the description of the box,

393
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:43,600
then we have the value of that description

394
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,283
and let's just call it text here.

395
00:14:46,241 --> 00:14:48,570
And then also, the icon name.

396
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:49,790
Okay.

397
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:52,020
So now, let's copy that text in here

398
00:14:53,447 --> 00:14:54,450
and of course

399
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:56,853
this now messes up our formatting.

400
00:14:58,420 --> 00:14:59,980
Let's just quickly fix that.

401
00:15:02,047 --> 00:15:02,880
And so now,

402
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,320
these variables here,

403
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,940
they really work like all the other variables in Pug.

404
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:08,773
So,

405
00:15:08,773 --> 00:15:11,563
here this should now be the text.

406
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,473
Right?

407
00:15:14,473 --> 00:15:16,410
And this here should be the description.

408
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,920
So equal description.

409
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,730
Well here it's actually called label in the CSS.

410
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:26,303
So let's call it label here as well.

411
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:30,833
Okay so label, text and icon.

412
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:35,280
And so here we also need to change the name of that icon

413
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,530
and all of these icon names

414
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:38,730
always start with icon dash.

415
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:40,630
And so all we really need to replace

416
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:42,350
is this part.

417
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:44,963
So let's create again a template string.

418
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,493
And then get rid of this.

419
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:52,943
And icon.

420
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,363
Okay and now we can use this.

421
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:58,800
I also wanted to say that

422
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:03,200
we could also have exported this mixin into another file

423
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,170
and then included that file here.

424
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:07,040
But I think this doesn't make much sense.

425
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,780
In this case because it is

426
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:11,890
not really a lot of code.

427
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:12,723
Anyway,

428
00:16:12,723 --> 00:16:15,760
let's now actually go ahead and use this mixin.

429
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,510
So let me copy just the name of it.

430
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:22,203
And so here instead of this overview box.

431
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:25,840
And for now let me actually just duplicate it here.

432
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:29,310
Okay, so we used this mixin

433
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:31,220
by writing plus

434
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:33,130
and then just like a regular function,

435
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:35,340
we passed empty arguments into it.

436
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:38,043
And so our first overview box is next date.

437
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:43,380
Then for now, just the date that is here.

438
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:46,383
So just that I can show you that it works in fact.

439
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,480
So August 20,

440
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,380
21.

441
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:51,363
And then here,

442
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,510
calendar.

443
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:56,280
Okay because that's the name here of the icon.

444
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,420
And so now we should get

445
00:16:58,420 --> 00:16:59,810
two boxes.

446
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,560
So this one and this one

447
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,740
which should look exactly the same.

448
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:05,800
So let's quickly confirm that.

449
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,830
And so then we can move on

450
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:10,103
to actually use the mixin properly.

451
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,240
And yeah,

452
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,163
so here are our two exactly same boxes.

453
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:17,490
Great.

454
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:20,203
So let's get rid of this first one.

455
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:25,760
And of course then here

456
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,233
we want the real date.

457
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:29,410
Okay.

458
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:31,060
And so that is,

459
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:31,893
add tour

460
00:17:32,917 --> 00:17:33,960
.start,

461
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:34,793
dates,

462
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:37,283
zero.

463
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:39,910
So let's take a look at that.

464
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:41,310
And remember,

465
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,410
that this is going to look a bit weird.

466
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:45,083
Such as it did before.

467
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:46,860
Okay.

468
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:49,820
So let's ahead and fix that.

469
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:52,503
So let's actually take that from here.

470
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:55,220
And so what we need

471
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:57,603
is basically this instead.

472
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:01,290
Now I don't want to make this line here

473
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:02,300
all too long

474
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,800
by simply pasting that here.

475
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,700
And so why not just create a new

476
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,560
java script variable for that.

477
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:11,100
So remember we need to use this syntax here

478
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,910
in order to create java script code

479
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:15,083
that's not going to produce any output.

480
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:17,613
And then

481
00:18:17,613 --> 00:18:20,133
again we can simply write java script here.

482
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:21,893
Okay.

483
00:18:21,893 --> 00:18:24,780
And so now in here I'm going to simply use

484
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,240
that date.

485
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,073
Great.

486
00:18:27,073 --> 00:18:29,470
And now let's just duplicate this here a couple of times

487
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:31,610
for all the boxes that we have.

488
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,623
So the first one is for difficulty.

489
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:38,833
And the icon is trending up.

490
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:44,483
Then the next one is for participants.

491
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,220
With the icon of user.

492
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:52,383
And the last one is rating.

493
00:18:58,010 --> 00:18:59,403
And the icon is a star.

494
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:02,770
So here we have the date but,

495
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:05,080
here in the difficulty we actually have tour

496
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:07,860
.difficulty.

497
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:10,810
Then here for the participants

498
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:12,740
we want this string.

499
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:14,053
Like 10 people.

500
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,830
So a template string

501
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,120
saying tour

502
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:22,940
.mix,

503
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:23,823
group size,

504
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:25,573
and then

505
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:28,570
people.

506
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:30,850
And finally we want the rating

507
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:32,333
and then out of five.

508
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:38,530
So tour,

509
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:40,730
and I can never remember

510
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:42,840
what I called this field.

511
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,673
And it is ratings average.

512
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:50,563
All right.

513
00:19:50,563 --> 00:19:51,396
And then,

514
00:19:51,396 --> 00:19:52,380
out of

515
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:53,213
five.

516
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,393
Okay.

517
00:19:55,393 --> 00:19:56,530
And that should be it.

518
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:58,660
Now we can get rid of all this code.

519
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:01,760
And this way it looks a lot nicer.

520
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,820
And just to make sure that works,

521
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:05,203
let's give it a save here,

522
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:08,140
reload,

523
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,350
and indeed,

524
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:12,170
we get easy, 25 people, and the rating

525
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:13,453
five out of five.

526
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,193
Awesome.

527
00:20:15,193 --> 00:20:17,440
So we already covered a lot of ground,

528
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,820
but let's split this video into two

529
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:21,930
and continue with the rest of the page

530
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:23,173
right in the next one.
