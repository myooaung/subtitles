00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:04.450
<v Narrator>So after the kind of heavy, theory lecture,</v>

2
00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:07.236
let's now actually see http in action

3
00:00:07.236 --> 00:00:09.640
and do some requests and take a look

4
00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:14.163
at the responses we got using our browsers developer tools.

5
00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:18.260
So I'm using Google Chrome as my browser,

6
00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.100
and I'm here on udemy.com.

7
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.260
So, just go to udemy.com,

8
00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.073
and then open your developer tools.

9
00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:31.150
And I am using the command option J for that on my Mac,

10
00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.870
on Windows it's probably Alt+Ctrl+J,

11
00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.100
or just right click anywhere on the page

12
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.260
and then click inspect,

13
00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.100
just in case you're not familiar with the dev tools.

14
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.120
Then, what we're gonna do is to head over

15
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.820
to the network tab.

16
00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.000
And then click here on disable cache.

17
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.110
That's important because otherwise

18
00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.240
you might be loading the page from your computer

19
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.310
because you've been to udemy.com before.

20
00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:59.930
Okay, so let's now reload the page,

21
00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.665
so that we're gonna kind of record

22
00:01:02.665 --> 00:01:06.640
the network activity here in this network tab.

23
00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.440
So reload this.

24
00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.500
And so now here we can see all the requests

25
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.060
that are happening on the page.

26
00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.130
So as I told you, there are gonna be lots of requests

27
00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.743
for all the elements that are on the page.

28
00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.200
Now if we're going the top here,

29
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.820
the first of all is actually udemy.com.

30
00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.870
And we can see here the status code, which is 200,

31
00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:31.550
as I said in the last lecture,

32
00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.040
that means okay.

33
00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.030
So everything went right.

34
00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.130
Then the size and the time it took

35
00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.500
to download this resource.

36
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.000
But then, we also have all of these other resources here

37
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.220
like the CSS files you see here,

38
00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.770
some images, java script files

39
00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:51.970
like I have here.

40
00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.830
And all of these were actually initiated by the index,

41
00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.913
so by the root page.

42
00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.140
Okay, so we have udemy.com and that one

43
00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.430
will then request all of these assets.

44
00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.840
So that is the index, so it doesn't happen in initiator,

45
00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.840
and all of these here were requested by the main udemy.com.

46
00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.220
Now if we click on one of these resources,

47
00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.730
and let's do actually udemy.com first.

48
00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.490
Here we can get some more information about the request,

49
00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:20.519
and the response.

50
00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:25.470
So first, the request which is actually at the bottom.

51
00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.040
And you'll see that the request was made to udemy.com,

52
00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.100
we did a get request,

53
00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.920
and the path was just the root path,

54
00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.450
just like I explained to you in the last video, okay.

55
00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.440
Then we have a bunch of headers,

56
00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.430
so this here for example means

57
00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.010
that the page was compressed using just a gzip.

58
00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.050
Down here you have a header for setting some cookies,

59
00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:51.990
and a bunch of other headers

60
00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.810
which we will talk about later on.

61
00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.970
So this is the request,

62
00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.520
and then the response

63
00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.840
also has a bunch of all of these headers, okay.

64
00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.700
So we can see when the response was actually sent.

65
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.521
We can see a bunch of cookies,

66
00:03:09.521 --> 00:03:11.820
and the status code here as well,

67
00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.120
so that's where the 200 status code comes from.

68
00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.330
And again, a bunch of other headers,

69
00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.100
that we're gonna talk about a bit later, okay.

70
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.260
And the same, of course,

71
00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.000
we have for all the other assets that were downloaded.

72
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.180
So the response and the request down here.

73
00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.120
And this time we actually see that

74
00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.880
the root here is still udemy.com,

75
00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.930
so what they call the authority here,

76
00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.980
but the path is then all of this,

77
00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:41.875
so this location here,

78
00:03:41.875 --> 00:03:45.850
where the CSS file is located.

79
00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.260
And if we actually now browse somewhere here on this page,

80
00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.080
let's say to the web development courses,

81
00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.253
well, then let's see what happens here.

82
00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.580
And, so here, we have this page,

83
00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.810
which is the web development resource, okay.

84
00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.690
So basically this piece here of the URL.

85
00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:07.620
Remember that this is called a resource,

86
00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.520
from the last video.

87
00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.289
So if we click on that,

88
00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:14.787
we will actually see that here again, right.

89
00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:18.120
So we have again

90
00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.750
udemy.com and the /coursesdevelopment/webdevelopment.

91
00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:27.040
So that is the path where the request is going to.

92
00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.190
Here on the left side we can also like preview images

93
00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.460
for example, this logo here.

94
00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.610
When it's an image, we can see the preview,

95
00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.790
we can see the response of it better.

96
00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:40.930
For example, in this one here,

97
00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.830
we can actually see the html response that came back.

98
00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.920
So instead of just seeing the headers like we did here,

99
00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:51.360
we can actually see the response as well,

100
00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.810
and a nice overview of all the cookies that were set

101
00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:57.500
in this request.

102
00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.240
Now we didn't talk about cookies just yet,

103
00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.230
but again that's something for later.

104
00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:06.790
But I think it's important that you get this overview

105
00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:10.120
of how requests and responses actually look like

106
00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.090
under a hood.

107
00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:13.610
So that was exactly the goal of this video,

108
00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:17.460
I hope the message was clear,

109
00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:18.990
and that everything made sense.

110
00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:20.220
And so, let's now move on

111
00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:24.213
and continue talking about backend development in general.
