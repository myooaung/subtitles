00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:05.030
<v ->So this section and the node form project</v>

2
00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:07.030
are now basically completed,

3
00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:09.340
but in this video I wanted to very quickly

4
00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.860
go over my VS code setup

5
00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.683
and also together with you set up the Prettier extension.

6
00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.960
And so these are the extensions that I have installed

7
00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.230
in my VS code and not all of them are going to be relevant

8
00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:25.540
for this course,

9
00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.060
but whenever there is a relevant extension

10
00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.600
I will mention it by the time that it is useful.

11
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.180
For example this .env extension here will be useful

12
00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.520
to highlight environmental variables in a .n file.

13
00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.560
So let's just quickly go over some of them.

14
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.310
For example ESLint is useful to find bugs in our code

15
00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:49.320
and actually we're going to set up ESLint with node a bit

16
00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.163
later in another section.

17
00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.830
We have image preview which is a very nice

18
00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:57.250
small extension to preview images.

19
00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.510
And maybe you have noticed that when we were doing this,

20
00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:02.373
for example,

21
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.510
the sample here you see that here on the left side

22
00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.140
it displays all the images that we include in a website.

23
00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.123
So in this example it is this one.

24
00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.170
All right so just something small that I found very useful.

25
00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.150
What else do we have here?

26
00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.550
We have Prettier and so this is the one

27
00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.400
that I want to config with you in this video,

28
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.760
but for now let's go over

29
00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:28.930
some other here.

30
00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.400
So Pug is a language that we're going to use later

31
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.860
to build templates

32
00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.620
and so it's useful to have this beautify

33
00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.090
extension for that one as well.

34
00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.680
Then I also have TabNine, which does some nice magic

35
00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.010
auto completer sometimes.

36
00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.150
Then I also have TODO Highlight,

37
00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.060
which is very useful to do

38
00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.510
this kind of

39
00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:52.870
magic here.

40
00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:54.320
For example when I have TODO,

41
00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.970
it will highlight it in this green color

42
00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:59.810
or if I write BUG

43
00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.410
like this it's going to turn red

44
00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:03.010
or FIXME

45
00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.900
and I have all kinds of these keywords here

46
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.680
that I have to find the different colors

47
00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.140
to make them visible in my code.

48
00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.120
And it even shows up here in this

49
00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.690
scroll bar.

50
00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.310
If I had these in different lines,

51
00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.660
then you would see

52
00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.570
the three colors are now here in this side

53
00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.613
and this is incredibly useful.

54
00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:25.940
All right.

55
00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.530
And then of course my

56
00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:28.970
VS code theme,

57
00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.790
which is Oceanic Next,

58
00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.070
so I get this question all the time

59
00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.350
and so instead of asking it

60
00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.100
well here is the answer for that.

61
00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.180
All right.

62
00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.160
But now

63
00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.800
about

64
00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:42.690
where is it?

65
00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.500
So Prettier

66
00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.860
this is a very nice extension that can

67
00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.840
automatically format code,

68
00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.390
no matter if JavaScript

69
00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:51.860
or CSS

70
00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.170
or even HTML.

71
00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.810
With this extension we no longer need to worry

72
00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.380
about formatting.

73
00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.690
And it is actually very opinionated,

74
00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.140
so it follows a very strict set

75
00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.840
of rules with only a small configuration possible.

76
00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.210
But in this case of code formatting,

77
00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:10.720
it's actually very nice when someone else

78
00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.030
takes these decisions for you.

79
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.150
So that is one less thing that we have to worry about doing.

80
00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.410
Okay, so our code will automatically

81
00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.910
format without us having to do anything

82
00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.373
or worrying about a certain style.

83
00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:26.313
Okay?

84
00:03:26.313 --> 00:03:27.530
So if you want to give it a try,

85
00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.450
please go ahead and install it now here.

86
00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.150
Probably you have a install button.

87
00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.480
I, of course, already have it installed.

88
00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.730
Next up what you need to do in order to get the full power

89
00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.020
of this extension

90
00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.930
is to go to your settings

91
00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.003
and then activate Format on Save.

92
00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:47.390
So just

93
00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.010
search for format and then Format on Save.

94
00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.780
So whenever we save a file now

95
00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.600
it will automatically use Prettier to format our code.

96
00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.250
So we installed Prettier.

97
00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.200
We enabled Format on Save.

98
00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.040
And now we can configure Prettier a little bit.

99
00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.873
Again,

100
00:04:04.873 --> 00:04:06.920
as I mentioned it's very opinionated.

101
00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.490
So there's not a lot of stuff that we can change

102
00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:12.310
but some things we actually can change.

103
00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.303
Now we could do that here,

104
00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.330
right in VS code,

105
00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:18.300
but instead

106
00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:22.760
what we can also do is to define a configuration file.

107
00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:23.593
Okay?

108
00:04:23.593 --> 00:04:26.460
And I find that actually better to do.

109
00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.400
So instead of using VS code to define the settings,

110
00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.000
we can use a Prettier config,

111
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.833
which is called

112
00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.970
Prettier RC.

113
00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:41.021
All right, so it has dot then prettier

114
00:04:41.021 --> 00:04:42.570
rc.

115
00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:44.740
Then we open the curly braces

116
00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.770
and then in here we can define some settings.

117
00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.250
And I find it better to do it like this

118
00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:52.240
because then I can change configurations

119
00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.290
from one project to another.

120
00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:55.540
And even more importantly,

121
00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:58.070
it makes it easier for multiple developers

122
00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:02.000
all on the same team to all use the same configuration.

123
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.610
Okay, so that can be very very useful on teams.

124
00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.220
Even more useful than when you're just working on your own.

125
00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:12.490
Now the only setting that I actually want to change here

126
00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:14.003
is called single quote.

127
00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.350
So actually Prettier already has this

128
00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:23.220
auto completion built in and so it knows that single

129
00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:24.653
will mean single quote.

130
00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:28.490
And the default is false, but I want to set it to true.

131
00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:31.720
And so what that's gonna do is that all my quotes

132
00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:35.360
will change from double quotes to single quotes, okay?

133
00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.750
So I gave it a save

134
00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:40.550
and here is our index.js.

135
00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:45.330
And now let's see if there is any double quotes here

136
00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:46.600
and I think they're not

137
00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:50.710
because I pretty consistently used the single quotes anyway.

138
00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:55.110
But let's just put some double quotes somewhere here

139
00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:57.670
and now I'm gonna give it a save

140
00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:59.750
and take a look at what happens.

141
00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:00.583
Whoa.

142
00:06:00.583 --> 00:06:04.500
So first of all you saw that a lot of stuff changed here

143
00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:07.870
and so our code kind of jumped around here,

144
00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:12.100
but this is where I had the single quotes here.

145
00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:15.063
So you see that they back to being the double quotes.

146
00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:18.640
Now all this code jumping around was probably

147
00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:21.490
because at some point I had multiple lines.

148
00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:23.430
And Prettier does not allow that.

149
00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:26.760
So if I have something like this and give it a save

150
00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:30.450
then Prettier will only allow one blank line.

151
00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:34.030
And actually this was for me the most difficult change

152
00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:36.760
of all the formatting that Prettier does.

153
00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:38.310
And it's not configurable

154
00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:40.600
so we cannot change that unfortunately.

155
00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:43.010
Because sometimes I like to have multiple lines,

156
00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:45.020
but with Prettier that's just not possible.

157
00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:47.550
I can do something like this and then it's gonna work

158
00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:50.190
but it's just a work around.

159
00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:54.160
But still with this problem I really prefer to use Prettier.

160
00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:57.420
Again because it takes the thinking of formatting

161
00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:58.343
away from it.

162
00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:03.120
For example, something else that I did here was this.

163
00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:05.980
So whenever a certain number of characters in a line

164
00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:07.130
is exceeded,

165
00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:10.080
it will then find a good way of breaking the code

166
00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:11.600
into multiple lines.

167
00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:13.890
And so that's what it did here.

168
00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:15.773
Let's see what else we have here.

169
00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:17.960
Well I think

170
00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:21.390
for maybe besides this change we just taught

171
00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:24.270
everything kind of remained the same.

172
00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:28.400
Okay and so from now on in all the rest of the codes

173
00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:29.233
in this course,

174
00:07:29.233 --> 00:07:33.360
I will always use this PrettierRC configuration file

175
00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:35.333
with auto save on true.

176
00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:38.290
Okay.

177
00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:39.663
Another thing that I didn't mention is

178
00:07:39.663 --> 00:07:42.820
that it automatically puts the semicolons,

179
00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:45.090
so if I go ahead and delete this one,

180
00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:46.940
and this one, and this one.

181
00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:48.180
Give it a save.

182
00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:50.020
You see that they are back.

183
00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:50.853
All right?

184
00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:53.170
Now if you want to get an overview

185
00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:55.993
of all the stuff you can configure with Prettier,

186
00:07:57.030 --> 00:08:00.623
well that's very simple if we write Prettier into Google.

187
00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:09.780
So they position themselves as opinionated code formatter.

188
00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:11.080
And like I told you before

189
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.300
and down here we have the options

190
00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:16.923
that we can actually configure.

191
00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:19.900
So print width.

192
00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:20.950
The tab width.

193
00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:24.300
So if you're one of these people who uses four width,

194
00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:27.630
which I actually was until kind of recently,

195
00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:29.130
like one year ago.

196
00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:32.960
Well then you can configure that using the tab width

197
00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:36.600
then you have for example the quotes that we just changed.

198
00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:39.850
So single quote we put it to true

199
00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:41.440
and you have all kinds of stuff.

200
00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:44.400
You can actually see it here on the right side, okay?

201
00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:47.000
But again, it's not a lot of configuration.

202
00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.273
So most of the stuff you can really not change.

203
00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:55.890
Another thing that we can experiment with is the tab width.

204
00:08:55.890 --> 00:09:00.773
So let's see this one to, I think the default is 80.

205
00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:06.693
Let's set it to something like 120.

206
00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:10.393
And

207
00:09:10.393 --> 00:09:13.920
I thought this would change this piece of code here,

208
00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:15.950
so being back to what we had before,

209
00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:17.180
everything in one line.

210
00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:18.203
Just to show you.

211
00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:21.880
But maybe our line is actually even longer than that.

212
00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:25.460
So let's put something really ridiculous here like 200

213
00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:27.460
and whoa!

214
00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:28.560
What's happening here?

215
00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:34.650
Ah ho! So you see that actually is now changed

216
00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:36.840
to something even weirder.

217
00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:39.323
Okay so I never did just kind of experiment.

218
00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:42.950
Put it back to 120

219
00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:44.463
and what's going on here?

220
00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:52.923
Let me just quickly fix this.

221
00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:56.800
And it does it again, all right.

222
00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:58.530
Put it back to 80 as we had

223
00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:02.420
and now it looks like this.

224
00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:03.253
Oh,

225
00:10:03.253 --> 00:10:04.086
yeah!

226
00:10:04.086 --> 00:10:04.919
Oh I'm sorry.

227
00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:07.740
That's not what I wanted to do.

228
00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:10.133
Of course I didn't want to change the tab width

229
00:10:10.133 --> 00:10:12.430
when my default is two.

230
00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:14.513
I wanted to change the print width.

231
00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:19.310
So basically how wide one line can be.

232
00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:21.283
Oh that was really stupid.

233
00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:28.883
So now it's back to normal because the default is two.

234
00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:34.120
So yeah now you can see that it actually got back into

235
00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:38.490
one line here because at this point here we are at column

236
00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:39.410
96.

237
00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:42.870
As you see down here and so the limit is 120.

238
00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:46.440
And so it didn't have to wrap this line of code

239
00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:48.240
into the second one.

240
00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:49.073
Okay?

241
00:10:49.073 --> 00:10:52.010
But I actually like this 80 limit

242
00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:54.060
and so I'm going to put it back here

243
00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:56.320
and use that one in the future.

244
00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:59.493
So I adjusted the default so let me just get rid of it.

245
00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:01.930
Give it a save.

246
00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:02.880
Give it a save.

247
00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:06.230
And so we're back to the way it was before.

248
00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:07.780
So if you think that you like this

249
00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:11.550
then please go ahead and use it just like I do.

250
00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:14.930
But if not, well then just kind of ignore everything

251
00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:16.590
that I said in this video

252
00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:19.260
and just keep doing the more normal way.

253
00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:20.943
So that's no problem as well.
