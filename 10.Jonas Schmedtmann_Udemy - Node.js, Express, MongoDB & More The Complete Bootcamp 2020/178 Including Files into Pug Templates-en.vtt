00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:03.430
<v Instructor>In this lecture, I want to just very quickly</v>

2
00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:05.760
show you a feature that we actually have

3
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.330
in all programming languages.

4
00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:09.870
We're just to include one file and in this case,

5
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.313
one template into another template.

6
00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:16.250
So let's say that we wanted to keep

7
00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:18.540
our base layout here really clean

8
00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.720
without any content in it.

9
00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.460
And so what we're gonna do is put all the code

10
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.180
for the header into one header file.

11
00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.040
And then include that file right here.

12
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.470
And the same also for the footer.

13
00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.990
And so then, our content block,

14
00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:35.670
so basically our body here

15
00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.650
becomes this very clean element only with these includes

16
00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:42.780
and then this content here for now.

17
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:43.613
Okay.

18
00:00:43.613 --> 00:00:47.633
So again, let's create a new file here for the header.

19
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.000
dot pug

20
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.640
And actually I like to prefix these files that only serve

21
00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.083
for being included with an underscore.

22
00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.710
And if you're familiar with something like Sass,

23
00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.423
then that will be familiar to you as well.

24
00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:08.400
Okay, so let's now go add and paste this here,

25
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.110
and not this code,

26
00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.740
so I guess I forgot to copy it or to cut even.

27
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.030
And then paste it here.

28
00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.940
And now this indentation is all wrong here,

29
00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.040
because now we have like three levels,

30
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.870
as you can see, so, one, two, three levels

31
00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:28.520
where this code should actually be here.

32
00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.940
Okay, and so now we need to go add and fix that

33
00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.250
but what we can actually do instead of doing it manually

34
00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.423
is to use a nice extension that does this work for us.

35
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.313
So here in my extension tab,

36
00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.930
let me show you the extension that I mean.

37
00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.380
And that is called Pug beautify.

38
00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.330
Okay, so go ahead and install this package, all right.

39
00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.210
And once you have that done,

40
00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.350
you can simply select all the code here

41
00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.970
by hitting command-A and then create a VS Code command

42
00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.810
by saying command-shift-P.

43
00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.310
And then in here, you write pug.

44
00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.800
And so this will then beautify pug.

45
00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.480
And you see that you also have the shortcut here

46
00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.610
and I'm not sure if this is the default one

47
00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.825
but at least in my case I can use the shortcut also

48
00:02:17.825 --> 00:02:19.740
to beautify this code.

49
00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.910
But anyway, by writing pug,

50
00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.590
you should get this selection here now.

51
00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.290
And if you then hit enter, it will, as you see,

52
00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.880
fix the indentation that was wrong in this file.

53
00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.230
All right?

54
00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.800
So give it a save, close it up

55
00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.103
and let's go back here actually.

56
00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.870
And now all we need to do is to say include _header.

57
00:02:46.297 --> 00:02:48.750
And the same for the footer,

58
00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.170
so let's cut it here, create a new template...

59
00:02:54.826 --> 00:02:55.659
_footer

60
00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.320
paste it

61
00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.940
select it, command-shift-P

62
00:03:02.061 --> 00:03:04.270
or probably in Windows that's control-shift-P

63
00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.460
and then actually the last one that was used

64
00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.470
will appear here at selection.

65
00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.043
So, hit return and there you go.

66
00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:14.763
That's fixed now as well.

67
00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:17.260
Include...

68
00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:20.500
footer.

69
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.200
And notice how we don't even need to specify

70
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.103
the dot pug extension again.

71
00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.610
So give it a save and when we now reload this

72
00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.800
it should look the exact same.

73
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.380
Well, not really, because these buttons here,

74
00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.860
they kind of shifted down,

75
00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.900
so they left this navigation bar.

76
00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.560
Or actually, this header, so that's not correct,

77
00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.230
maybe that was some problem

78
00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.990
with this auto indenting here in the header.

79
00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:53.510
And yeah, actually that's not correct

80
00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:56.523
because all of this should be inside the header.

81
00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.040
So this nav, this div and this nav

82
00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.180
they should all be on the same level.

83
00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.030
And so now that's correct.

84
00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.623
Just to make sure, let's also check the footer.

85
00:04:10.786 --> 00:04:12.740
But here, it actually is correct,

86
00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:15.690
so I'm not sure what actually went wrong in this situation.

87
00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.073
But anyway, let's try that again now.

88
00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.230
And so here we go.

89
00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:26.100
Anyway that is simply including some files,

90
00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.283
one into the other.

91
00:04:28.382 --> 00:04:30.380
In the next video, we will then do something a bit similar,

92
00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:35.120
but at the same times way more complex and also more useful.

93
00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.580
So if you're curious about what that is

94
00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.963
then just join me right in the next one.
