00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:02.880
<v ->Now before we can move on to</v>

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.940
writing some actual express code,

3
00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:06.690
we first need to install yet

4
00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:07.690
another tool,

5
00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:08.730
and this time it's an

6
00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.680
app called Postman.

7
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.820
And Postman is a beautiful tool

8
00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.460
that allows us to do API testing.

9
00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:17.380
It's a little bit like a browser

10
00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:19.640
but it doesn't render any html

11
00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.800
or any visible websites to us.

12
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.870
Instead we can do all kinds of requests

13
00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:25.770
and then receive the response simply

14
00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.540
as text then work with that response.

15
00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.471
So as they say Postman simplifies API development

16
00:00:31.471 --> 00:00:33.290
and that really is true.

17
00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:34.900
And that kind of is the standard

18
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.630
application that you will see everyone

19
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.750
using basically for testing APIs.

20
00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.500
But you can do a lot more than just testing

21
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.900
and we will see many of these features

22
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.690
throughout this course.

23
00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.340
For now, just head over to getpostman.com

24
00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.550
So, as you can see here in the url

25
00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.213
and then here on product, just hit Postman.

26
00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.533
Then finally download the app,

27
00:00:58.533 --> 00:01:00.400
and then download.

28
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.150
So, I'm not going to download it right now,

29
00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.190
of course I already have it installed.

30
00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:05.880
And so let's now take a look at how

31
00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.540
Postman actually works.

32
00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.140
So I'm going to open up Postman.

33
00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.130
That takes a little time,

34
00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:14.550
and so here we go this is

35
00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.280
how Postman looks like.

36
00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.330
And probably when you downloaded yours,

37
00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.760
it's going to be in a light version,

38
00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.040
but if you like the dark mode, like me,

39
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.745
just open up the settings and on themes,

40
00:01:25.745 --> 00:01:28.920
you can just use the dark theme over here.

41
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.690
All right, so as I said, it's a little

42
00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:33.770
bit like a browser where in here we

43
00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.890
can enter a url and do the request.

44
00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.890
Now, it does allow us to do all kinds

45
00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.200
of requests, where in the browser

46
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.440
whatever we put in here in the url bar,

47
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.470
it's always going to be a get request.

48
00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.560
But here we can change that, we can use

49
00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.280
get or post or put or patch and all

50
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.867
these http methods here.

51
00:01:51.867 --> 00:01:53.510
Where some of them we have already

52
00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:55.280
talked about before, and will keep

53
00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.490
talking about in this section. Okay?

54
00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.530
Now just to test it very quickly,

55
00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.170
Let's use again the dog API that we used before.

56
00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:04.550
So that was at

57
00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:07.150
dog.ceo

58
00:02:09.556 --> 00:02:10.389
then dog API then let's

59
00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:13.380
just simply use this url here

60
00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.080
Okay. And so all we have to do is

61
00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.730
to put it here, this case we really want

62
00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.850
a get request and then send.

63
00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.808
And after some time, it should

64
00:02:24.808 --> 00:02:26.640
then show up down here.

65
00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.290
And indeed, here we go.

66
00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.360
So, that is the Json data just

67
00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.430
as we expected it. Okay.

68
00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.540
So it looks exactly like what

69
00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:35.373
we have here.

70
00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:37.270
Right?

71
00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.040
Now we can then actually save

72
00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.940
these requests here, and we

73
00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.497
can create collections and folders

74
00:02:42.497 --> 00:02:43.922
to organize our requests.

75
00:02:43.922 --> 00:02:46.110
We can run automatic tests.

76
00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.347
We can set up different development

77
00:02:48.347 --> 00:02:50.970
environments or production environments

78
00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.080
and all kinds of other useful stuff.

79
00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.720
Like sending data in the body for

80
00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.460
a post request or a patch request.

81
00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:00.702
Or we can set headers or really,

82
00:03:00.702 --> 00:03:04.726
all you can imagine about building APIs.

83
00:03:04.726 --> 00:03:07.200
So from now on, in the next couple sections,

84
00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.259
we're always going to be using

85
00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:11.300
Postman to run or request.

86
00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:12.133
Okay.

87
00:03:12.133 --> 00:03:14.060
So this was just a very quick demo

88
00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.310
of Postman so that starting now

89
00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.015
we can start building our API

90
00:03:18.015 --> 00:03:20.253
then test it using this tool.
