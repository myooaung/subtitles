1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,140
<v Instructor>So in this video,</v>

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:05,610
we're going to continue implementing the review's resource

3
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:07,960
and this time by implementing an endpoint

4
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:12,083
for getting all reviews and also for creating new reviews.

5
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,970
And so at this point, we're basically just reviewing stuff

6
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:20,040
that we already learned before in previous sections.

7
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:23,230
And so in this video, I have another challenge for you.

8
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:26,690
So basically, I want you to implement both these endpoints,

9
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:28,720
so one endpoint for getting all review

10
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,800
and one endpoint for creating new reviews all on your own.

11
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,633
Okay?

12
00:00:33,633 --> 00:00:35,320
So create the controller file,

13
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,970
then in there create the controller functions,

14
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:42,390
and then also create the routes in your review routes file.

15
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:45,550
And then by the end of course, create some new reviews

16
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:48,040
and also retrieve them from the database

17
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,090
using get all reviews.

18
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:50,923
All right.

19
00:00:50,923 --> 00:00:54,103
So please pause the video now and get to work.

20
00:00:57,730 --> 00:00:58,563
All right.

21
00:00:58,563 --> 00:01:01,600
And now it's my turn to actually implement this,

22
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,993
and I'm starting with the controller functions.

23
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:08,370
So right here we create

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,130
review Controller dot js

25
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:19,403
then of course we start by requiring the review.

26
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:31,253
So one level up, then models, then review model.

27
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:39,860
So get All Reviews, and we're using

28
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:42,030
the same name as always.

29
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:43,430
Right?

30
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:44,860
Then we already know this is going to be

31
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:47,800
an async function because we're going to be dealing

32
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,123
with the database here,

33
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:57,270
and also we need to wrap this entire function

34
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:59,293
into the catch Async.

35
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,763
So catch Async, I think that's what it's called.

36
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,313
Require.

37
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:17,803
All right.

38
00:02:24,705 --> 00:02:29,288
And now let's simply fetch all the reviews using await,

39
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:34,823
and then just a simple find without any filter.

40
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:42,520
A status of 200 and then send back to normal JSON.

41
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:47,830
Status as success.

42
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:49,670
We also define the result property

43
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:52,583
with the reviews dot length,

44
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:58,373
and of course, then the data itself.

45
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:04,053
Give it a save here and now onto the next one.

46
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:08,790
So create Review.

47
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:10,100
All right.

48
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:12,120
And you start to seeing here that

49
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,490
we're building a lot of duplicate code actually.

50
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:17,690
So all of this here looks

51
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:20,650
basically exactly the same as it looks for the users,

52
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:21,810
and for the tours.

53
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:22,800
Right?

54
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,490
And actually we are going to fix this

55
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:26,240
a bit later in the section.

56
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,490
But for now, I really just want to make this work.

57
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:30,323
Okay?

58
00:03:30,323 --> 00:03:33,130
So for now don't worry about writing all this

59
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,793
kinda duplicate looking code.

60
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:41,090
Okay.

61
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:43,863
So we call this here new Review,

62
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:51,090
and then as always we use dot create with all the data

63
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,450
coming in from the body.

64
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:55,283
Okay?

65
00:03:55,283 --> 00:03:58,220
And so, again if there are any fields on the body

66
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,890
that are not in the review schema

67
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:02,240
then they will simply be ignored.

68
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,810
And so that's why it's safe to

69
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,690
actually simply do it like this

70
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:07,750
when creating a new resource.

71
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:08,950
All right?

72
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:11,853
Anyway, let's now send it back to the client as always.

73
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:16,613
So with a status of 201 for created,

74
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,260
and review should be the new

75
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,090
Review.

76
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:33,923
All right.

77
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:39,970
Actually without the colon there, semicolon, and so yeah.

78
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:41,630
These are all controllers.

79
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:43,843
Now let's move on to the route.

80
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,090
So review

81
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,393
Routes dot js.

82
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:53,210
And here of course we start

83
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:55,693
by requiring our controller,

84
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:08,220
and to the controllers and

85
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,053
review Controller dot js.

86
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:15,633
Next up, we need to create our router.

87
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:21,800
So express, and so of course we also need to

88
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,590
import express here.

89
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:25,973
So let's do that before doing anything else.

90
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:33,913
Express.

91
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,523
So dot Router, and I think this is how it works.

92
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:45,540
And now router

93
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,770
and define our route

94
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:54,430
and this again is basically route of the reviews.

95
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:55,263
Okay.

96
00:05:55,263 --> 00:05:57,090
Because remember how in the next step

97
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:58,600
we are actually going to mount

98
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,700
this router on API slash reviews.

99
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:02,533
Okay?

100
00:06:02,533 --> 00:06:05,920
So just like we did with the tours and the users.

101
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:09,260
And actually let's do that before we do anything else.

102
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,093
Okay?

103
00:06:10,093 --> 00:06:12,210
So just to take that confusion

104
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:13,950
that you might have away.

105
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:16,573
So, let's export the router from here.

106
00:06:21,516 --> 00:06:22,349
Okay?

107
00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:24,500
And so now we can move over

108
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,063
to app dot js.

109
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,290
And then of course import our router here.

110
00:06:37,571 --> 00:06:38,571
And require,

111
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,210
review routes.

112
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:45,170
Okay?

113
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:47,790
And so now we come down here

114
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:51,600
and mount this router on a new path.

115
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,910
And that path is going to be as I said

116
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:56,400
API slash V1 slash

117
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:58,623
reviews.

118
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:00,573
Okay.

119
00:07:00,573 --> 00:07:02,580
And so again this router here

120
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:05,670
that we're specifying now is basically a middleware

121
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:08,420
that we mount upon this path.

122
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,253
Okay?

123
00:07:09,253 --> 00:07:10,770
So whenever there is a request

124
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:13,650
with a url that starts like this

125
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:15,430
then this middleware function here

126
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:16,890
will basically be called.

127
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:18,640
And so that is then our router

128
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,910
and in there just the slash route,

129
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:23,230
so just the root basically will

130
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:26,510
then be this API V1 reviews.

131
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:27,430
Okay?

132
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:31,200
So just like we did it before we the other two resources.

133
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,020
So tour Model, that's not where we were working.

134
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,223
We were working in the review Routes.

135
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,360
Okay.

136
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,840
So we specified a route.

137
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,240
Let's now specify the method

138
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,283
for which we specify our function.

139
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:48,240
So we have get, and for that we used

140
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:50,950
or we actually rewrote

141
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:55,440
review Controller dot get All Reviews

142
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,273
Right?

143
00:07:56,273 --> 00:07:59,480
And then we also have post for

144
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:04,370
create Review.

145
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:05,203
Okay?

146
00:08:05,203 --> 00:08:06,420
Give it a save.

147
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,940
And actually we only want authenticated users

148
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:11,010
to be able to post reviews.

149
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:14,960
And also only users that are actually regular users.

150
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,210
So not administrators and also not tour guides.

151
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:19,043
Okay?

152
00:08:19,043 --> 00:08:21,060
So how can we implement that?

153
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:23,820
Let's remember our authentication section.

154
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:26,913
So we start by requiring our auth Controller.

155
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,860
So again, controllers and auth Controller.

156
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,420
And now all we need to do

157
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:43,450
is to actually use the middleware functions

158
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:45,140
that we specified in there.

159
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:46,280
Remember.

160
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:50,640
So first, we use the protect middleware,

161
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,950
so auth Controller

162
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:54,400
dot protect

163
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,260
and this will make it so that we protect this route

164
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:00,520
to only be accessed by users who are authenticated.

165
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,353
Right?

166
00:09:01,353 --> 00:09:02,697
And then in the next step we say

167
00:09:02,697 --> 00:09:05,170
that we want to restrict this route

168
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:08,830
so we use our restrict To middleware

169
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:12,273
to only users with the role of user.

170
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:14,980
All right?

171
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:18,070
So again, we did this here before a couple of times.

172
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:21,680
And so, not really anything new at this point.

173
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,513
Okay.

174
00:09:22,513 --> 00:09:24,490
So I think we followed all the steps.

175
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:27,650
So first off, we have a model which will allow us

176
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,420
to create new documents.

177
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:31,430
Then we have our Controller functions

178
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:34,550
defined in our Controller to get all reviews

179
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:36,460
and to create reviews.

180
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:38,820
Then, we used these Controller functions

181
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:39,910
or handler functions

182
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:41,370
as you can also call them,

183
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:43,560
to create some new routes.

184
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,393
Okay?

185
00:09:44,393 --> 00:09:46,500
And so we created a route for getting reviews

186
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,000
and for posting reviews.

187
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,690
And just like before we did this

188
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:52,330
basically in a mini sub-application

189
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:54,130
which is just for reviews.

190
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:56,630
And so that's why we created our new router

191
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:59,620
which then we imported into our main application

192
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:02,660
and mounted it on this url where we want

193
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:05,520
to access everything related to reviews.

194
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,600
All right?

195
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,793
So, let's now actually go ahead and test this.

196
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:14,560
So I'm gonna go ahead, copy this,

197
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:18,680
and create a new tab here

198
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,620
and so here

199
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,040
it's reviews

200
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,113
and of course post.

201
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:26,970
All right.

202
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:29,080
So, what do we actually need to specify

203
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,963
in order to post a new review?

204
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:36,340
So we need the review itself.

205
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:37,173
Remember.

206
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:42,103
So let's say "amazing tour"

207
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,770
then the rating

208
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:46,470
and I'm gonna give it five here,

209
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:48,883
and then the tour and the user ID.

210
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:54,723
Okay?

211
00:10:54,723 --> 00:10:58,970
And so now we need to get the ID of one of the tours.

212
00:10:58,970 --> 00:10:59,803
Okay?

213
00:10:59,803 --> 00:11:02,670
And so let's use the first real tour here

214
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:06,583
let's say, so let's use this sea explorer.

215
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,313
All right?

216
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:10,213
So,

217
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,660
the ID of the sea explorer

218
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,575
and now we of course also need

219
00:11:16,575 --> 00:11:20,080
the ID of the user posting the review.

220
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,380
And we can get that here from

221
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,130
get all users.

222
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:25,640
And so actually we only have one user

223
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,470
which is a regular user.

224
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:31,303
So this Jonas here and so let's get this ID.

225
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:33,370
All right?

226
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:35,020
Now keep in mind that this user

227
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,730
actually needs to be logged in.

228
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:37,563
Okay?

229
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:39,150
And so a bit later we will then actually

230
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:42,180
automatically get the user ID from the user

231
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:43,670
that's already logged in.

232
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:46,980
Remember we can do that because the protect middleware

233
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:49,790
will put the user on the request object.

234
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:50,930
Remember that?

235
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:53,640
But for now, I wanted to keep it simple here,

236
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,220
and so with the current implementation

237
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:58,800
we actually need to provide the user's ID as well.

238
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,633
Okay?

239
00:11:59,633 --> 00:12:02,390
But still we need to log in as a regular user

240
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:05,130
because we protected this route.

241
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:06,490
Remember that?

242
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:09,713
So let's just close a couple of these.

243
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:15,040
Okay?

244
00:12:17,368 --> 00:12:18,701
And log in here.

245
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:24,080
And we do that as, so what hello dot Jonas at IO

246
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,430
so hello.

247
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:29,850
And his password is probably and I hope

248
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:31,053
it is still the same.

249
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:36,430
And actually it's not so let's try a new password

250
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:40,223
cause I remember I used that one when we changed passwords.

251
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:47,240
Still doesn't work, and so let's actually

252
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,530
create a new user.

253
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:49,363
Okay?

254
00:12:49,363 --> 00:12:52,850
Of course we could do the reset password at this point,

255
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:54,320
but that's a bit too much work

256
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,760
and so I'm simply going to create a new user

257
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,570
so that's easier just for testing it now.

258
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:00,403
Okay?

259
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:05,110
So let's use test at Jonas dot IO

260
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:07,603
and the name here is gonna be test user.

261
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:11,643
All right.

262
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:16,790
Oh, and we already have that email address in our database

263
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:17,740
and that's strange.

264
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:20,413
We have user.

265
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:24,190
Maybe it didn't, we didn't update this properly.

266
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:27,130
Oh, but maybe it's a deleted user.

267
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:29,380
So a user that's no longer active

268
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:31,620
and is therefore not showing up here.

269
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:34,750
So let's just take a look at that in compass.

270
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,820
And of course when you're in development mode,

271
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:40,730
you're gonna run into these kind of issues all the time.

272
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:43,660
So here, test Jonas, and as I was saying,

273
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:46,110
it's actually one of these deleted users.

274
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:48,640
So active set to false.

275
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,423
So let's try that again.

276
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:56,663
So test user here simply as well.

277
00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:01,330
So send it now and now we are logged in.

278
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:04,800
And so now I'm copying the ID from this new user

279
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,493
to create this new review.

280
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:09,570
All right?

281
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:11,290
Let's send it now,

282
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:14,580
and of course we get the you are not logged in error

283
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,330
because we actually didn't provide

284
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:18,590
our JSON web token.

285
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:21,140
So we need to come to authorization

286
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,920
then the bearer token,

287
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,320
and then of course this one.

288
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,863
So, if we try this now again,

289
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:31,480
then here we go.

290
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,313
Okay.

291
00:14:32,313 --> 00:14:34,653
Let's create another one for another tour,

292
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:37,313
this time for,

293
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:40,270
for the next one,

294
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:42,560
so for Forrest Hiker.

295
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,253
So copy the ID here as well.

296
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:47,323
Yeah.

297
00:14:47,323 --> 00:14:50,693
Here the user is gonna be the same, but another tour.

298
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:54,750
Let's give it a four stars.

299
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:58,147
And let's just say "loved it."

300
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:00,630
Something very simple

301
00:15:01,979 --> 00:15:02,812
and okay.

302
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,570
Give this a save,

303
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:07,260
and I'm gonna create

304
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:09,290
a new folder here for the reviews

305
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:15,143
and of course

306
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:18,120
something went wrong here.

307
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,920
So where is that folder?

308
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,140
Mm.

309
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:24,423
It's nowhere really so let's just create it here.

310
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:39,323
And we can actually change the name up here as well.

311
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,353
So create

312
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:44,983
new review.

313
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,400
Okay.

314
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,543
And now we also want to get all reviews.

315
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,503
So we no longer need these two.

316
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:07,720
Okay and this one is really a GET,

317
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,723
and let's also save it in Reviews.

318
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:19,220
Get all the reviews.

319
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:22,210
And so that should be enough to get us started

320
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:24,660
and really see all our reviews.

321
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,860
Okay, and here we go.

322
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:29,350
Let's take a look at compass,

323
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:31,810
and to see the reviews here we need to go ahead

324
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:33,870
and reload the entire database,

325
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:37,130
but now when we come to Reviews here we indeed see

326
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:40,593
our two reviews that have been created as well.

327
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,150
Okay.

328
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:45,040
Now how do we make it so that

329
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,000
we actually see the user and the tour data here

330
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,480
instead of simply the IDs?

331
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,190
Well, of course we need to again use populate.

332
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:55,050
Right?

333
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:57,070
And so that's exactly what we're going to do

334
00:16:57,070 --> 00:16:58,253
in the next video.
