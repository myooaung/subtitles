00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:04.030
<v ->So, let's now use the Sendgrid service</v>

2
00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:07.880
in order to send real emails to real email inboxes.

3
00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.603
Rather than to our development inbox at Mailtrap.

4
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.710
And so, let's open up a new tab here

5
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.730
and search for Sendgrid and then it is here,

6
00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:21.040
SendGrid.com

7
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.090
All right, so we can try it for free.

8
00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:27.810
It will then have some limits

9
00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.400
but you can still create a free account

10
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.010
from which you can send like, one hundred emails per day.

11
00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.530
All right, so go ahead and create your account here

12
00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.923
and once you're ready come back to this video.

13
00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.420
Okay, and after creating your account

14
00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:45.950
you should see your dashboard

15
00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:49.090
that should look something like this, all right?

16
00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.120
So you see there's a ton of stuff here on the left side

17
00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.940
you can choose like templates, you can see all kinds

18
00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.000
of statistics about the emails that you're sending.

19
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.610
And really, there is a ton of settings

20
00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.350
that you can also set here, okay?

21
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.500
But for now, what we are interested in,

22
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.180
is in the Set up Guide.

23
00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.080
Okay?

24
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.050
So here in the top left corner of your dashboard

25
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:14.850
you should have this menu here

26
00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.590
where we then want to click the Set up Guide.

27
00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.120
Now if the page at the time you're watching this video

28
00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:21.640
looks somewhat different,

29
00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.020
then you might also find the Set up Guide link

30
00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.580
somewhere down here.

31
00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.360
And in this case here on the sight side.

32
00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.460
So let's open that up and now what we want to do is here

33
00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:38.460
to integrate using our Web API or SMTP relay, all right?

34
00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.410
And you could also easily integrate Sendgrid

35
00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:45.120
into Wordpress or Drupal or something like that.

36
00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.560
But of course, that's not what we want.

37
00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.890
So here we want the first option

38
00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.550
and then we want the SMTP Relay.

39
00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.400
Because that is the one that we need

40
00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.090
if we want to use node mailer

41
00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.850
and create a transport with that.

42
00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.690
And so that's exactly what we're doing

43
00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:02.840
and so we choose this one.

44
00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.740
On the other hand, we could also use

45
00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.470
the simple to use Sendgrid API

46
00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.800
and so then we would choose this way.

47
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.440
But again, with node mailer we need to choose

48
00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.443
this option here.

49
00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.530
And then from here it's very easy.

50
00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.490
So here we just need to create an API key with some name.

51
00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.967
And so that name is not really relevant at all,

52
00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.930
so let's just call it "natours".

53
00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:28.963
Create Key.

54
00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.170
And so now to configure or transport a node mailer

55
00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.990
all we need is actually this user name and this password.

56
00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:40.550
So let's add these two to our config file

57
00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.027
so I'm copying the password and the user name is "apikey."

58
00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.297
So, config.env

59
00:02:49.297 --> 00:02:51.540
and then everything that's related to emails,

60
00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:52.883
let's put that here.

61
00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.160
So SENDGRID

62
00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:58.673
USERNAME

63
00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:00.693
is apikey.

64
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.430
And Sendgrid PASSWORD

65
00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:08.253
is this one.

66
00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.880
And once more I really ask you

67
00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.030
to create your own account and your own API key

68
00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.540
and password instead of using mine, okay?

69
00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.030
Because if many people do that,

70
00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.820
it will quickly stop working for everyone, all right?

71
00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:24.610
So please create your own account

72
00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.170
and generate your own password, okay?

73
00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.453
So there is actually enough for us to create or transport.

74
00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:35.663
And so let's do that here,

75
00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.363
so node mailer.createTransport.

76
00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.570
And now, remember how I told you when we first created

77
00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:49.420
this email handler a couple of seconds ago.

78
00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.830
That there are some services that are already predefined.

79
00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:54.903
And Sendgrid is actually one of them.

80
00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.633
So we can specify service and then set it to Sendgrid.

81
00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:03.343
All right?

82
00:04:03.343 --> 00:04:05.970
And we actually did this before for Gmail

83
00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.760
and with that all we needed to then pass in

84
00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.830
was the user name and a password.

85
00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:13.120
And so here is going to be exactly the same.

86
00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.940
And that's the reason why we actually don't even need

87
00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.770
to specify the Server and the Port, okay?

88
00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:22.830
Because node mailer already knows this data

89
00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.253
because is specifying this Sendgrid service.

90
00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:30.640
So now, we just need to specify the authentication

91
00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.090
and the user is at process.env.SENDGRID

92
00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:39.563
USERNAME.

93
00:04:40.712 --> 00:04:42.612
And now let's just duplicate this here

94
00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.373
and here, pass.

95
00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:51.783
Okay, and that's actually it.

96
00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:55.800
And now to test this, let's create a new user

97
00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.583
with a real email address.

98
00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:04.940
So we go to Postman and let's close all of these here.

99
00:05:09.994 --> 00:05:10.827
All right,

100
00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.980
and so I will create "Jonas."

101
00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:19.250
And now as the email address I will create one of these

102
00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:22.590
disposable emails which is basically an email address

103
00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:25.513
and an inbox for which we don't even have to sign up.

104
00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:30.333
So, we're going to use the Mailsac service.

105
00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.413
So that goes like that,

106
00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:40.140
and so here we can now really put anything.

107
00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:41.583
So let's just put "Jonas"

108
00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:46.570
and then everyone can access this, all right?

109
00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:49.860
So I will now register with this email address

110
00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:53.563
and so the welcome email should then end up in this inbox.

111
00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:57.750
And you of course, when you're testing this on your own

112
00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:01.610
can of course use your own email address for this, okay?

113
00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:04.800
So go ahead, create a user basically for yourself

114
00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:09.350
with your own email address, and then hit "Send."

115
00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:12.563
And so now our email should be sent using SendGrid.

116
00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:16.140
And now that might take a little bit of time

117
00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:21.320
but let's reload here, maybe it's already there.

118
00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:22.493
And actually it's not.

119
00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:26.093
So let's take a look at here our dashboard.

120
00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:29.170
And from my experience,

121
00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:31.540
this actually doesn't work right away.

122
00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:34.570
So for example this "EMAILS TODAY" number here

123
00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:37.130
always takes some time to actually update.

124
00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:39.800
And also the first emails that you send,

125
00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.443
they not always actually show up where they should.

126
00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:47.410
So this behavior that we're seeing here is kind of normal.

127
00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:51.760
But let's try this again, so we still got no email here.

128
00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:54.490
But actually the reason for that is

129
00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:57.730
that remember that this transport is only going to work

130
00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:00.330
in production and so actually we need

131
00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:03.270
to run our application in production.

132
00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:05.820
Which right now we are not doing.

133
00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:07.610
So let's now do that,

134
00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:12.203
npm run start production,

135
00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:17.960
and so let's now actually try that again.

136
00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:21.503
So first I'm going to delete the user that we just created.

137
00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:28.933
So it's this one here,

138
00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:35.340
and actually let me delete all of these

139
00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:36.673
that we don't really need,

140
00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:40.683
so all these test users.

141
00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:45.970
All right, and so now let's try this again

142
00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:47.390
with this email address.

143
00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:53.550
And that is still successful and now let's take again

144
00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:55.773
a look at our email inbox.

145
00:07:56.837 --> 00:08:00.093
We look that, and now we get one message!

146
00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:05.330
So, when we open that, then here it is.

147
00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:07.530
Now for some reason, this application

148
00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:10.570
is doing something weird with this button here.

149
00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:12.410
So it seems like they are applying

150
00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:14.480
their own styles here to this email.

151
00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:16.700
But nevermind, what matters here

152
00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:18.540
is that it did actually worked.

153
00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:20.970
And so now, we send our very first email

154
00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:23.393
using Sendgrid to a real inbox.

155
00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:27.670
Now let's just see if it actually shows up here as well.

156
00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:31.253
But as I said, sometimes that takes sometime to show up.

157
00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:36.170
So as I mentioned before, it still shows zero emails here

158
00:08:36.170 --> 00:08:39.803
while in fact, we already sent and received one email.

159
00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:43.160
Okay.

160
00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:46.310
So great, so with this you can now send

161
00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:49.470
up to one hundred free emails, I believe.

162
00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:51.870
It says something here, yeah.

163
00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:54.230
So with the trial, that you just started

164
00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:55.150
I think it's even more,

165
00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:57.300
it's like thousands of emails per day.

166
00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:59.470
But the after some time, you get downgraded

167
00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:01.030
to just one hundred.

168
00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:03.370
So if you have a real app and a real company,

169
00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:06.780
of course you'll have to pay for this one (mumble).

170
00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:10.510
But then at that point, that's also no problem hopefully.

171
00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:14.620
Anyway, this now wraps up our part about sending emails.

172
00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:17.320
And in the rest of this (mumble), we're now gonna be talking

173
00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:20.210
about accepting payments with credit cards

174
00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:22.870
and creating bookings in our system.

175
00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:25.910
So that is really really exciting and so,

176
00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:27.483
I hope to see you there soon.
