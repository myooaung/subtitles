1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:02,890
<v ->So up until this point in the course,</v>

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:05,610
we have just been building our API,

3
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:08,230
which can be consumed by a web client,

4
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:10,210
in order to build a website,

5
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:12,470
or a native application.

6
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:15,312
But now, in this section, we will finally use

7
00:00:15,312 --> 00:00:17,815
everything that we've built until now,

8
00:00:17,815 --> 00:00:21,390
to create server-side rendered websites.

9
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:23,179
And this is now quite easy to do

10
00:00:23,179 --> 00:00:25,380
because we've already done

11
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,910
most of the preparation work before,

12
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:31,120
like building a working authentication system,

13
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,760
modeling all our data,

14
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:34,514
and really so much more.

15
00:00:34,514 --> 00:00:37,730
So in this section, we will really start to see

16
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:39,780
our application coming to life,

17
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,170
with a beautiful user interface

18
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:44,920
built out of HTML and CSS,

19
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,430
and not just the JSON data.

20
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:50,290
So I can't wait to finally start this part

21
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:51,190
of the course now.

22
00:00:52,084 --> 00:00:54,667
(upbeat music)
