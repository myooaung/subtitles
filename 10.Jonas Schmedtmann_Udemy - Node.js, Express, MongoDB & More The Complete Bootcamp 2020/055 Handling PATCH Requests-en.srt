1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:03,700
After get and post, let's all learn

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:05,320
how to handle patch requests

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:07,273
to actually update data.

4
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:10,420
And I'm pretty sure that at this point,

5
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:11,960
you already have a good idea

6
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,460
of how we're going to do that.

7
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:16,853
So let's do that after post,

8
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:19,653
so down here,

9
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:24,150
and remember that we actually have two http methods

10
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:25,400
to update data.

11
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,690
We have put and we have patch.

12
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:30,580
And with put, we expect that our application

13
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:33,770
receives the entire new updated object,

14
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:36,854
and with patch, we only expect the properties

15
00:00:36,854 --> 00:00:40,670
that should actually be updated on the object, all right?

16
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:42,540
So usually, I like to use patch,

17
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,290
because I find it easier to simply update the properties

18
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:47,950
that were updated.

19
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:51,000
At least, when we start using MongoDB and Mongoose,

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,690
it will be much easier to just do it like that, all right?

21
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:56,410
And it's alsp easier for the user

22
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:58,850
to simply send the data that is changing,

23
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:01,723
instead of having to send the entire new object.

24
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,000
So again, we are going to make our app work

25
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,033
for patch and not for put.

26
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:12,460
So we expect a patch request to come in on the URL

27
00:01:13,335 --> 00:01:18,335
just like before, "api/v1/tours,"

28
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,490
and now we actually also need the ID

29
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:24,910
of the tour that should be updated.

30
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:27,610
And so that is slash and then "id."

31
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:30,853
Okay, so that's what we learned in the last lecture.

32
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:36,830
So, what do we want to do when there is a patch request,

33
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:39,260
so when we want to update the data?

34
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:41,400
Well, actually, I'm not really gonna implement

35
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,160
this operation here, because that's just a matter

36
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,750
of writing some more JavaScript

37
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,670
that is not really important,

38
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:52,070
because, again, this is just testing API-using files.

39
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:54,870
In the real world, we're never gonna use files for that

40
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:56,280
anyway, okay.

41
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,020
So, I'm really just implementing all of these verbs here

42
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:01,840
so that you get a good idea of the different verbs

43
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,405
that we use with http,

44
00:02:03,405 --> 00:02:06,730
the kind of status codes that we send back,

45
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:10,220
for example, here we sent 201,

46
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:13,720
while here we sent 200 and 400,

47
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,410
and also for example, here,

48
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:19,343
when we had multiple tours, we sent the results,

49
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:24,170
and when we created a new tour, we sent that data back

50
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:28,020
immediately, with this newTour that was created,

51
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,410
and so that's the kind of stuff that I want you to learn

52
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:32,290
for now, in this section.

53
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:35,600
So the basics of working with the Express, of course,

54
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:39,270
and also, the correct way of sending back API responses,

55
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:42,960
okay, and so, again, I'm not going to implement the updating

56
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,540
of tour here, because that would be a lot of work,

57
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:49,059
you would have to get tour from the JSON file,

58
00:02:49,059 --> 00:02:53,360
than change that tour and then save it again to the file.

59
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,370
And that's a bit too much work here,

60
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:57,130
and so let's simply go out

61
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:59,690
and send back a standard response.

62
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:04,517
So "response.status,"

63
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,100
and we will still use 200 here,

64
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,910
so when we update an object or a resource,

65
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:12,603
we send back 200, okay,

66
00:03:13,532 --> 00:03:16,210
and then the usual JSON

67
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:22,453
with the status of success.

68
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:26,890
And then we send back the data, and in this case,

69
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:28,163
the updated tour.

70
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:33,360
So we say "tour," and then here, in this position,

71
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,880
we would send back the updated tour, okay.

72
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:40,933
Right now, I'm going to send back a string which says like,

73
00:03:43,677 --> 00:03:46,650
"updated tour here...," something like this.

74
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:48,950
So basically, just a placeholder here.

75
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:53,720
And we can also kind of implement this code here,

76
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:57,490
so in order to only send this when the ID is actually valid,

77
00:03:57,490 --> 00:04:01,590
so let's get that from here,

78
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:06,590
and so this way, we can also actually use this ID here.

79
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:07,623
Right.

80
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:10,440
So we're not gonna do this one

81
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,653
because we don't have any tour, but we will use this one.

82
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:20,040
So this will be "req.params.id,"

83
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:24,410
and I'm converting it to a number here as well, times 1,

84
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:27,230
and if it is greater than the tour's length,

85
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:29,980
well then just like before, it is an invalid ID,

86
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:33,000
and we send a 404, for not found.

87
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,283
And so like this, we should now be ready to test it.

88
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,740
So, let's first of all save the request

89
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,540
that we did in the previous lecture.

90
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:48,667
So, just "Get Tour."

91
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,163
And I'm just going to go ahead and copy this one here.

92
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:02,190
And let's specify the patch method.

93
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:05,580
So this one's patch, and I will save it here right away as

94
00:05:08,347 --> 00:05:09,427
"Update Tour."

95
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:14,250
Okay, and you see this one here gets this gray text,

96
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,770
so they're very easy to distinguish here

97
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:18,623
in this side column.

98
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:24,100
So we actually should specify some body here,

99
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,350
so let's just go ahead and copy it from here,

100
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:34,300
so remember, body, raw, and then JSON,

101
00:05:34,506 --> 00:05:35,653
just like this,

102
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,150
and so, let's say that all that I want to do

103
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:42,733
is to change the tour number three, let's say,

104
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,320
so let's take a look at that one, so, one, two, three,

105
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,570
and I want to change the duration to fifteen.

106
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:55,133
Okay. Saving it again.

107
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:57,940
I'm going to save this one as well,

108
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:01,910
because then it will actually save this text here in a body,

109
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:04,770
and if I close it and open it up again later,

110
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:06,730
then all this text here is back,

111
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:09,083
and that will make my life a lot easier then.

112
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:12,410
Okay, but anyway, back to this one.

113
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:14,270
We set the duration to fifteen.

114
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:16,100
Now, keep in mind, that this will of course

115
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,030
not change anything in the data

116
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:20,417
because we did not implement that.

117
00:06:20,417 --> 00:06:23,980
Okay, so I'm sending the response now.

118
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:27,808
And so, here we see "updated_tour_here...,"

119
00:06:27,808 --> 00:06:30,070
just in the place where in the real world

120
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:33,130
we would then get the updated data back.

121
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:36,083
Right, just to test it with a wrong ID,

122
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:40,160
we get this "fail," and this "Invalid ID."

123
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,750
Okay, so give it a save and close it up,

124
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:46,870
and I'm going to close up this one as well.

125
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:50,830
Okay, so almost done with the CRUD operations,

126
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:54,864
so create, read, update, and delete, and as you can hear,

127
00:06:54,864 --> 00:06:57,560
the last one that's missing is delete,

128
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,010
and so let's take care of that in the next video.
