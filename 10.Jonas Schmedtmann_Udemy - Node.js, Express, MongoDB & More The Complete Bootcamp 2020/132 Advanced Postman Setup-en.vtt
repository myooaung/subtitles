00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:04.670
<v Narrator>Let's now create a more advanced Postman setup,</v>

2
00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:06.900
in order to make our lives a bit easier

3
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.483
when working with this tool.

4
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.580
So, back here in Postman,

5
00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.640
the first concept that I want to show you

6
00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.080
is the concept of environment.

7
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.000
So, maybe you've noticed that up here it says

8
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.200
no environment, right?

9
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.630
And, so that's because, well,

10
00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.510
at this point we haven't created any environment.

11
00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:26.343
All right.

12
00:00:26.343 --> 00:00:29.610
And, so, basically, an environment is like a context

13
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:30.920
where our app is running.

14
00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.810
And, we can then specify a couple of variables

15
00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:35.563
for each of these environments.

16
00:00:35.563 --> 00:00:38.230
And, the two ones that make the most sense is,

17
00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.740
just as we have in our express application,

18
00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.760
the development and the production environment.

19
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.983
So, let's start by adding our first, our environment here.

20
00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:48.673
OK.

21
00:00:48.673 --> 00:00:53.303
And, I'm gonna call this one depth and then for naters,

22
00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:56.790
so the name of our application.

23
00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.019
OK.

24
00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:01.569
And, so the variable that I'm gonna create here is called

25
00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:02.600
URL.

26
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.440
Because that's the most important thing

27
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.180
that I want to change from one environment to the other.

28
00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.730
So, in development, we will have one URL,

29
00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.240
and then in production, we will have another one.

30
00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.210
Right.

31
00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.644
And, so, let's now set the URL here to

32
00:01:18.644 --> 00:01:23.157
http

33
00:01:23.157 --> 00:01:24.990
127001,

34
00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.870
which stands for localhost.

35
00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:28.970
Then, port 3000

36
00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.210
and, I think that's actually it.

37
00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.630
So, that's the initial value of our URL variable.

38
00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:37.600
OK.

39
00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.090
So, let's now add

40
00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.560
And, so just like this, we have our new depth environment.

41
00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.963
We can then add one for production as well.

42
00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.930
But, right here we don't really have a URL

43
00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:55.120
just yet.

44
00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.080
So, that simply said Naters dot io,

45
00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.390
which does not exist.

46
00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:00.223
OK.

47
00:02:00.223 --> 00:02:02.850
But, this is simply, let's say, a placeholder.

48
00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:03.683
All right?

49
00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:06.163
OK.

50
00:02:06.163 --> 00:02:08.480
So, let's now actually go ahead and use

51
00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:11.780
this environment variable that we just created.

52
00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.383
So, remember, it's called URL.

53
00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.260
And, so now, what I want to do

54
00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.880
is to go ahead and replace this URL here

55
00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.880
so, this here, with the variable that we just created.

56
00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.490
And, we do that by using curly braces,

57
00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:28.900
the name of the variable,

58
00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.513
and then curly braces again.

59
00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:32.223
All right.

60
00:02:32.223 --> 00:02:34.760
And, so this will basically now be replaced

61
00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.870
with the variable coming from our environment.

62
00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.700
Now, when we hover this, we can see that it is

63
00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.060
unresolved, but that's because we didn't choose

64
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.810
our environment yet.

65
00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.870
So, we need to come to this menu here

66
00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.240
and then we select depth to Naters.

67
00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.400
And, so if we hover it now, you will see

68
00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.543
that it's actually the variable that we just defined before.

69
00:02:55.619 --> 00:02:56.452
OK.

70
00:02:56.452 --> 00:02:59.010
So, if we try to send a request now, then, of course,

71
00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.940
we get the correct response just like we did before.

72
00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:03.773
OK.

73
00:03:03.773 --> 00:03:06.520
And, so I hope you can see how useful this will be

74
00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.340
later when we're in production.

75
00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.150
Because, if we didn't have these environment variables,

76
00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.800
then later on, when we want to switch to testing

77
00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.273
this API in production,

78
00:03:15.273 --> 00:03:16.750
then we would have to go ahead and

79
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.950
manually change all of these URLs in all of the requests.

80
00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.850
And, for now, we don't have that many.

81
00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:25.950
But, imagine we have 30 or 50 or 100 requests,

82
00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.010
and we would then manually have to change these URLs

83
00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.360
in all of them.

84
00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.670
And, that would not be fun at all.

85
00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.870
And, so now we will do that once

86
00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.850
and then it's done for the rest of

87
00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:38.580
the project development.

88
00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:39.540
Right?

89
00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.290
So, if we change now to production, for example,

90
00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.280
then, well, here we would have Naters dot io

91
00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.733
and then API v1 and tours.

92
00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:49.540
All right.

93
00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.530
So, let's now go ahead and copy this

94
00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.293
and actually paste it into all of these.

95
00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:00.590
So, of course we have to do it once now.

96
00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.700
But again, it's better to do it now that we don't

97
00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.370
have that many endpoints here yet,

98
00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:06.573
than to do it later.

99
00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.170
So, save this one.

100
00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:10.950
Save this one again.

101
00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.590
Actually, let's get rid of this property.

102
00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:15.663
So, save.

103
00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:17.363
Save.

104
00:04:19.514 --> 00:04:21.640
And, save this one as well.

105
00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.340
So, I'll do it in all of them now.

106
00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:26.523
OK, just very quickly.

107
00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:31.893
And, these two already have it.

108
00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:33.793
All right.

109
00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.750
Then, get all tours.

110
00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.243
Get tour does not.

111
00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:49.400
All right, save.

112
00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.130
And, actually, we can hit Command-S,

113
00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:52.680
just like in any other app.

114
00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.540
And, then Command-W to close the tab.

115
00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:57.373
OK.

116
00:04:57.373 --> 00:04:58.640
So, just like in Google Chrome,

117
00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:59.473
for example.

118
00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.500
So, Command-Save, Command-S,

119
00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:03.683
and then Command-W.

120
00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:07.223
So, just to make it a bit faster,

121
00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.773
And, now we're almost done here.

122
00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:27.983
And, that's it.

123
00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:30.033
OK.

124
00:05:30.033 --> 00:05:31.730
And, so just like this we have basically

125
00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:35.700
future-proofed our API development here with Postman.

126
00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:38.010
Next up, remember how in the last lecture,

127
00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:40.450
I said that I was gonna automate basically

128
00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:43.030
the process of copying this token here.

129
00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:47.500
And, then pasting it right here into this bare header.

130
00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:48.333
All right.

131
00:05:48.333 --> 00:05:50.060
And, so let's now actually do that.

132
00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:51.660
And, for that, we will actually have to

133
00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:53.150
write a little bit of code.

134
00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:54.650
But, that's no problem at all.

135
00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:56.804
So, let's do that.

136
00:05:56.804 --> 00:05:58.180
And, sign up and then login.

137
00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:59.710
Cause these are the two places,

138
00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:01.340
so the two endpoints

139
00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:05.420
from which we will receive a json web token, right?

140
00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:07.290
So, we come here to the test tab,

141
00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:09.250
which we haven't used yet.

142
00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:11.570
And, so here we will programmatically set

143
00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:13.280
an environment variable.

144
00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:14.113
OK.

145
00:06:14.113 --> 00:06:16.650
So, we created environment variables before

146
00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:19.350
using this dialogue here, OK?

147
00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:21.760
But, now here with code, we will basically

148
00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:25.200
programmatically create an environment variable as well.

149
00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.830
And, we will create one for the json web token

150
00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:30.190
that we receive in the request.

151
00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:31.023
OK.

152
00:06:31.023 --> 00:06:33.570
And, so basically all we need to do is to use

153
00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:36.030
the snippets that we have here.

154
00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:37.300
All right.

155
00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:39.930
So, in this case, we want to set an environment variable

156
00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:41.950
and, so let's just click here.

157
00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:45.570
And, indeed, we get this pre-written code for us here.

158
00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:46.403
OK.

159
00:06:46.403 --> 00:06:48.340
This is basically just some JavaScript

160
00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:51.360
that we can access here in Postman.

161
00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:54.280
So, PM, which probably stands for Postman,

162
00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:56.783
dot environment, which is the current environment.

163
00:06:56.783 --> 00:06:58.310
And, then, set.

164
00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:01.303
So, set the variable called JWT.

165
00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:05.280
And, then, of course, the value of that.

166
00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:07.120
And, where is that value?

167
00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:10.780
Well, it is in PM dot response

168
00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:13.020
dot json.

169
00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:15.283
So, basically, to convert it to json.

170
00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:19.450
And, then dot token.

171
00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:21.320
And, it's dot token here, of course,

172
00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:23.920
because that's the name of our property

173
00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:25.710
in the response object.

174
00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:26.543
OK.

175
00:07:26.543 --> 00:07:29.420
So, basically, this code here gets the response for us

176
00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:33.370
and, then, on there we can write the dot token property,

177
00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:36.663
and then assign to the JWT environment variable.

178
00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:38.823
OK.

179
00:07:38.823 --> 00:07:40.050
And, so now we have an active test here,

180
00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:42.810
which is why we get this blue dot

181
00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:44.500
or a green one, maybe, (laughing)

182
00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:46.750
and so let's now test it out.

183
00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:50.460
So, let's sign up with a new user.

184
00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:51.973
I'm calling it test user.

185
00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:55.400
We need to get rid of this comma.

186
00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:57.113
And, now let's send it.

187
00:07:57.950 --> 00:07:59.580
And, we could not get any response.

188
00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:02.620
And, that's because I have naters dot io here.

189
00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:05.100
So, I'm in the wrong environment.

190
00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:08.340
So, of course, we want to be in development.

191
00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:10.180
So, send it again.

192
00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:12.900
And, so here indeed, we get our token.

193
00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:16.010
And, so let's now check if it is in our

194
00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:17.090
environment as well.

195
00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:18.800
So, for that, we come here.

196
00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:23.290
Def, naters, and indeed, here we now get JWT

197
00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:27.370
and then this token that we have also down here.

198
00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:28.203
OK.

199
00:08:28.203 --> 00:08:29.700
That token variable that we have here

200
00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:33.040
should be the exact same as the one down here.

201
00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:35.070
So, Postman got it from here,

202
00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:38.563
and then posted it as this new environment variable.

203
00:08:40.050 --> 00:08:40.910
OK.

204
00:08:40.910 --> 00:08:43.710
So, that's the first step and the second step

205
00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:46.900
is to now go to one of our protected routes,

206
00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:49.610
which, in this case, is only this one.

207
00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:52.490
And, then here we can actually delete

208
00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:55.103
this at all.

209
00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:57.660
So, right over on this side,

210
00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:00.043
OK.

211
00:09:00.043 --> 00:09:01.780
So, get rid of all of that.

212
00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:03.080
And, then here we have,

213
00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:04.400
as you maybe have seen,

214
00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:06.320
an authorization tab.

215
00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:07.153
OK.

216
00:09:07.153 --> 00:09:08.890
So, here we can now specify the type

217
00:09:08.890 --> 00:09:10.450
of authorization.

218
00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:12.690
And, you see all of these differents here,

219
00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:15.383
but we are going to choose the Bearer Token.

220
00:09:16.491 --> 00:09:17.455
OK.

221
00:09:17.455 --> 00:09:18.670
So, just like we have specified Bearer

222
00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:20.320
in our token,

223
00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:22.960
we also have to name Bearer here.

224
00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:23.793
OK.

225
00:09:23.793 --> 00:09:24.626
So, Bearer Token.

226
00:09:24.626 --> 00:09:27.560
And, now all we need to do is to specify the token.

227
00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:29.510
And, remember how we do that?

228
00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:33.363
Well, actually the exact same way as we did up here.

229
00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:36.620
So, curly braces, curly braces,

230
00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:39.077
JWT, and then close it.

231
00:09:39.077 --> 00:09:40.840
So, it turns orange

232
00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:43.430
and that means that it should now work.

233
00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:45.253
And, let's now test this.

234
00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:48.620
And, bam, here we go.

235
00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:51.510
So, we really got access to the data,

236
00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:54.193
which means that the token was successfully sent.

237
00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:55.940
All right.

238
00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:57.470
And, we can actually see that here

239
00:09:57.470 --> 00:09:58.760
in the headers.

240
00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:01.100
So, it automatically pre-filled this header

241
00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:02.310
now for us.

242
00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:05.040
So, we have authorization where we have Bearer

243
00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:06.890
and all of this good stuff here.

244
00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:08.250
And, actually, it also now

245
00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:10.263
put all of this stuff here for us.

246
00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:12.023
OK.

247
00:10:12.023 --> 00:10:14.530
So, actually, this is exactly what we saw before

248
00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:17.710
when we previewed the request dot headers object

249
00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:18.950
in express.

250
00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:20.440
Remember that?

251
00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:21.273
OK.

252
00:10:21.273 --> 00:10:23.640
You see here that it's actually just

253
00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:25.500
temporary generated.

254
00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:27.053
So just so we get a preview.

255
00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:28.823
All right.

256
00:10:28.823 --> 00:10:30.460
And, so, that's actually it.

257
00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:32.480
This makes our life so much easier

258
00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:34.900
when we're working here with authentication.

259
00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:36.770
Because, each time we want to add a new

260
00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:37.840
protected route,

261
00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:39.810
all we need to do is to come here

262
00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:42.430
to the authorization tab and then add

263
00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:44.140
this variable here

264
00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:45.630
and specify that we're working

265
00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:47.550
with a Bearer token.

266
00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:48.790
All right.

267
00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:50.340
And, actually, I just realized that

268
00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:51.600
we're not just yet.

269
00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:54.510
Because, we have this here in sign up,

270
00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:55.600
so, this test.

271
00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:58.060
But, of course, we also need it in login.

272
00:10:58.060 --> 00:10:59.270
So, that's the other place

273
00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:02.090
from which we can get a new, fresh token.

274
00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:03.250
Right?

275
00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:05.340
So, let's copy this,

276
00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:06.503
give this one a save,

277
00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:09.270
also save this one,

278
00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:11.320
and, then here at login,

279
00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:12.620
post it here.

280
00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:13.770
Save it.

281
00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:15.210
And, I don't even need to test it

282
00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:17.980
because, well it should work just the same

283
00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:19.670
as with sign up.

284
00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:21.040
All right.

285
00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:21.873
OK.

286
00:11:21.873 --> 00:11:22.910
This was very important

287
00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:24.530
for us in order to move on

288
00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:27.100
and to make our lives a bit easier

289
00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:28.500
when you're working with Postman

290
00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:30.293
for your API development.
