00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:02.070
<v Instructor>In this video,</v>

2
00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.620
we're gonna build the user account page

3
00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.270
mostly using concepts that we already know

4
00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:08.823
and already used before.

5
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.470
And let's start by taking a look

6
00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:15.340
at what I actually mean with the user account page

7
00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:20.230
in our reference website so here on natours.dev.

8
00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:22.920
So we already rendered this menu here

9
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.210
on our website,

10
00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.430
but when we click then on this user

11
00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.210
we get access to the user account page.

12
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.349
And so here, we can change some basic settings,

13
00:00:33.349 --> 00:00:35.807
also upload a new photo,

14
00:00:35.807 --> 00:00:37.540
but this one we are going to do

15
00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.013
in the next section actually,

16
00:00:40.043 --> 00:00:44.690
and the user can also update his password on this page.

17
00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.590
Then, on the left side there are some menu items,

18
00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:49.740
which we will not really implement

19
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.120
so we will only implement the menu,

20
00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.027
but not really the pages that they point to,

21
00:00:55.027 --> 00:00:57.840
and then if the user is an administrator

22
00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.690
we also render this part down here.

23
00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.380
Okay, so this is what we will be building in this lecture,

24
00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:06.440
and in the next couple of lectures we will then

25
00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.440
actually take care of really updating the settings.

26
00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.113
So, basically making these buttons here work.

27
00:01:14.227 --> 00:01:15.060
All right?

28
00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.620
But for now, it's just rendering this page here

29
00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.443
on this .me URL.

30
00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:22.610
Okay?

31
00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.343
So, let's start with the pug template.

32
00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.080
All right, and so as always,

33
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.873
I already have this accountTemplate here.

34
00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.453
So let's grab that, copy it,

35
00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.253
and then create a new view down here,

36
00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:44.360
which I'm calling account.

37
00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.810
And now we want to extend the base

38
00:01:51.281 --> 00:01:56.270
and we want to create a block called content as always.

39
00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.863
And then in here is where we actually paste our content.

40
00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.010
All right?

41
00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.000
Now we need to indent all of this

42
00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.803
to make it inside of the block.

43
00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.640
Great, so, here first we have our navigation, right?

44
00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.540
So settings, bookings, reviews, and billings

45
00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.020
that we saw there on the left side of the page,

46
00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.430
and then we also have the Admin navigation, right?

47
00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.590
And they already see a lot of duplicate code here.

48
00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.770
So basically this list item elements here,

49
00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.950
they appear actually eight times.

50
00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.970
So four times up here and four times down here

51
00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.730
so let's very quickly just create a mixin for them

52
00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.330
to make our code look a bit cleaner.

53
00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.310
All right, so I'm gonna go ahead

54
00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.610
and actually copy one of these.

55
00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.953
And then create a new mixin called navItem.

56
00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.480
Okay, so we did that before.

57
00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.120
So this is very similar.

58
00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.500
So what do we need to pass into this mixin

59
00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.100
in order to basically customize each of these items?

60
00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.773
Well, what's going to change is the link.

61
00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:13.960
Also the text, so settings, bookings, et cetera.

62
00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.360
So that's text.

63
00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.240
Then also the icon is going to be changing,

64
00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.980
and finally you see that this first one here

65
00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.690
has the side-nav--active class, right?

66
00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:30.530
And so we will also specify an active like here basically.

67
00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.110
And then when we want to mark an item as active

68
00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.390
we will simply pass in through here.

69
00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:36.762
Okay?

70
00:03:36.762 --> 00:03:39.573
So now we need to fix the indentation here.

71
00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.123
And then pass in our data.

72
00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.363
Next is the text.

73
00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.900
So this, of course at this point,

74
00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.607
is nothing new so I'm doing it pretty quickly here, right?

75
00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:12.000
So icon and then the name of the icon that we pass in.

76
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.860
So just like we did it before,

77
00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:15.640
and then finally this active here,

78
00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.220
remember, will be either true or false.

79
00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.840
And if it is true then we want to add this class.

80
00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:22.753
So let's copy it.

81
00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.063
And then here let's specify the class attribute.

82
00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.470
And then just like we did,

83
00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.910
let's do a turnery statement in here.

84
00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:38.480
So saying if active, basically,

85
00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:42.003
then here we want to have side-nav--active.

86
00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:45.490
And if not then we want nothing.

87
00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.243
So an empty class name, basically.

88
00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:49.980
All right.

89
00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:53.800
And so now we can replace this with our mixin.

90
00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.270
So that's called navItem, and so remember,

91
00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.180
we write + and then navItem.

92
00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:05.230
So here the link is an empty link.

93
00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:07.520
And actually for all of them for now.

94
00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:08.353
Then

95
00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:10.623
Settings,

96
00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:14.980
then the name of the icon which is also settings,

97
00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:16.083
but in lowercase.

98
00:05:18.341 --> 00:05:21.060
And then finally this one is actually active,

99
00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:22.323
and so we pass in true.

100
00:05:25.541 --> 00:05:28.057
All right, let's duplicate it.

101
00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:36.513
Have a briefcase and we have My Bookings.

102
00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.490
Let's make that lowercase.

103
00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:43.090
All right, duplicate it two more times.

104
00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:44.480
So here we have star

105
00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:49.990
and then here credit-card

106
00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:56.423
for billing.

107
00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:00.383
All right.

108
00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:06.820
And now we have the admin navigation.

109
00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:08.560
And this one will only be visible

110
00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.660
if the current user is an administrator.

111
00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:15.660
So let's actually define that using an if statement.

112
00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:18.370
And so here we need to test if the user role

113
00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:20.360
equals to admin, right?

114
00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.270
And so that's, again,

115
00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:23.450
one of these more complex if statements

116
00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:26.410
and so we have to use JavaScript for that.

117
00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:29.441
So I'm using here unbuffered code again.

118
00:06:29.441 --> 00:06:30.640
And then if

119
00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.710
and so we will have access to the user variable in here.

120
00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:38.290
So just as we did in other templates.

121
00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:41.200
So basically we're gonna pass it into here.

122
00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:44.750
And then of course, the user has the role attribute,

123
00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:47.210
and so we test if it's admin.

124
00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:51.230
And if it is then we want to display all of this.

125
00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:54.963
And so it now needs to be one level indented.

126
00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:57.593
Okay?

127
00:06:57.593 --> 00:07:00.270
And of course now we want to replace all of these here

128
00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:03.023
with our mixin as well.

129
00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:09.083
So four times.

130
00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:13.003
This one is called map.

131
00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:15.613
Manage tours.

132
00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:24.823
This one is Manage users.

133
00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:39.323
Manage reviews.

134
00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:43.800
And then finally we have one with the briefcase.

135
00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:49.030
And this one doesn't have the text here,

136
00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:50.723
but it is Manage bookings.

137
00:07:55.548 --> 00:07:56.830
All right.

138
00:07:56.830 --> 00:08:01.830
So let's get rid of that and continue our work down here.

139
00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:03.830
So this one here will be the form

140
00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:06.130
for changing the user settings.

141
00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:10.600
And so the personal data will be here in these values, okay?

142
00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:14.460
So basically in an HTML input element,

143
00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:17.300
the value is kind of a predefined text

144
00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:20.220
that we can put inside an input element.

145
00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:21.690
And so usually what we put there

146
00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:23.930
is the current value of that input,

147
00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:25.160
so of that field.

148
00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:28.780
And so right now, that's of course the name of the user.

149
00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:30.130
And so let's put that here.

150
00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:36.480
User.name.

151
00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:40.202
And then down here it's then of course

152
00:08:40.202 --> 00:08:42.693
the email.

153
00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:49.343
And here we also have the image of the user.

154
00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:59.060
So image slash users slash the image name itself.

155
00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:02.443
Okay.

156
00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:06.783
Then down here there's nothing to do.

157
00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:08.670
All right?

158
00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:10.470
And actually that's it.

159
00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:12.640
So that's really all the data

160
00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:14.620
that's coming from the user object

161
00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:15.823
that we have to put in.

162
00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:20.110
Okay, so that is the template.

163
00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:25.110
Let's now go ahead and add the route to the viewRouter.

164
00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:29.813
So right here, and this one is gonna be called /me.

165
00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:35.560
And so we're gonna have a controller called getAccount.

166
00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:39.330
Now this one here, of course,

167
00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:42.470
is actually going to be a protected route, right?

168
00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:45.240
Because only if we are actually logged in

169
00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:48.260
we will get access to this page.

170
00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:52.020
And so we need to use our protect middleware here.

171
00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:55.973
So that's an authController.protect.

172
00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:58.730
Okay?

173
00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:02.100
So just as we did with all or other protected routes.

174
00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:04.500
Now one problem that I see with this

175
00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:06.560
is that this protect middleware here

176
00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:09.280
is very similar to the isLoggedIn.

177
00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:12.270
And so we will actually do some duplicate operations there,

178
00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:13.610
which is not ideal.

179
00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:16.500
Because remember that this isLoggedIn

180
00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:19.930
will run for all the requests, right?

181
00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:22.400
So let's quickly take a look at these

182
00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:24.203
so that I can make my point.

183
00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:30.300
So in protect we get the current user down here.

184
00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:33.020
So we have this findById here.

185
00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:34.580
But we do the same

186
00:10:36.757 --> 00:10:39.650
down here in loggedIn, okay?

187
00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:44.010
And so by using isLoggedIn and protect at the same time,

188
00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:45.720
we will do this query twice.

189
00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:48.410
And so that is not ideal of course.

190
00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:51.980
And so let's put this isLoggedIn here

191
00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:55.210
only under routes which are not protected, okay?

192
00:10:55.210 --> 00:10:56.660
Because on the protected route

193
00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:58.690
this check if the user is logged in

194
00:10:58.690 --> 00:11:02.270
will actually happen as well, right?

195
00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:03.870
But not in this middleware,

196
00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:05.450
but then in the protect middleware

197
00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:09.000
because it basically checks for that as well, right?

198
00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.573
So let's cut it from here and simply paste it

199
00:11:12.573 --> 00:11:15.393
in other routes which are not protected.

200
00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:20.300
Okay, make sense?

201
00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:23.340
And so like this we do not have this problem

202
00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:26.400
of basically doing the exact same query twice

203
00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:28.580
in all the protected middlewares.

204
00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:31.680
And that's a bit better for our performance.

205
00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:34.722
Now this one thing that we do in the isLoggedIn

206
00:11:34.722 --> 00:11:36.900
that we currently do not do in protect

207
00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:39.880
is this here.

208
00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:43.510
So we put a current user on the response.locals.

209
00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:45.534
And so let's actually do the same

210
00:11:45.534 --> 00:11:48.220
now in the currentUser.

211
00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:51.543
And so let's do the same here in the protect middleware.

212
00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:56.510
So you put the currentUser both on request.user

213
00:11:56.510 --> 00:11:59.590
and on response.locals, all right?

214
00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:01.600
So that we can then automatically use it

215
00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:03.690
in all the templates after it.

216
00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:07.560
So in this case, in our account template, all right?

217
00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:08.693
So give it a save.

218
00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:14.040
And now we need to add this getAccount controller

219
00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:16.903
in order to, of course, fix this error

220
00:12:16.903 --> 00:12:18.293
that we get currently.

221
00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:20.900
So that's in viewsController,

222
00:12:27.467 --> 00:12:32.467
.getAccount request and response.

223
00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:37.170
And you will see in a second why we only need these two.

224
00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:39.580
So to get the account page,

225
00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:43.370
all we really need to do is to simply render that page.

226
00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:45.910
We don't even need to query for the current user

227
00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:47.760
because that has already been done

228
00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:50.030
in the protect middleware, right?

229
00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:51.810
And so really all we really need to do

230
00:12:51.810 --> 00:12:54.110
is to do something like this.

231
00:12:54.110 --> 00:12:55.870
So copy this code,

232
00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:59.030
and then here account.

233
00:12:59.030 --> 00:13:04.030
And let's give it a title of Your account.

234
00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:07.840
All right, so that makes that error disappear.

235
00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:09.880
And now as a final piece of the puzzle,

236
00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:13.063
let's add the correct link, actually, in the header.

237
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.110
So here in our header right now the link

238
00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:21.670
doesn't point to this account page, right?

239
00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:24.043
So it points to nowhere.

240
00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:27.713
And so it should now point to /me.

241
00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:32.380
Okay, and so that should be the final piece

242
00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:33.763
to actually make it work.

243
00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:36.840
And so let's log in here now

244
00:13:38.281 --> 00:13:40.513
with test one, two, three, four.

245
00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:44.320
We are successfully logged in.

246
00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:48.950
And now upon clicking here we get our page.

247
00:13:48.950 --> 00:13:50.590
Fantastic.

248
00:13:50.590 --> 00:13:54.030
Now there's one error here with the User photo.

249
00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:55.270
So let's fix that.

250
00:13:55.270 --> 00:13:59.460
But beside that, actually all of it is working just fine.

251
00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:03.750
We also get this menu here because we are currently in admin

252
00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:06.370
and so let's test that also in a second

253
00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:08.903
to see if it disappears for other users.

254
00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:14.150
And actually we also get this error down here

255
00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:17.500
because we have a failed request for the image.

256
00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:19.070
And so we already see that we're

257
00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:20.920
probably doing something wrong there.

258
00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:25.860
And so here in the image, of course,

259
00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:30.500
it's not user.name, it is user.photo.

260
00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:33.670
So give that a save, reload here.

261
00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:35.483
And now indeed, there we go.

262
00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:37.673
All right?

263
00:14:37.673 --> 00:14:41.200
So now let's log out, see what happens then.

264
00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:43.460
And then we get this kind of error.

265
00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:46.200
And that's basically because we're trying to access

266
00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:49.417
this protected route while not being logged in.

267
00:14:49.417 --> 00:14:50.250
All right?

268
00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:54.540
So let's try that again now.

269
00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:58.720
So if we try to log in with /me,

270
00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:01.920
then we get you are not logged in, okay?

271
00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:04.550
And before we got that weird looking error

272
00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:07.070
because we're actually right now in development.

273
00:15:07.070 --> 00:15:08.290
But in production, of course,

274
00:15:08.290 --> 00:15:11.850
we wouldn't see that weird error that we saw before.

275
00:15:11.850 --> 00:15:12.710
Right?

276
00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:15.410
But what we see now is that, of course,

277
00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:16.930
our route really is protected.

278
00:15:16.930 --> 00:15:20.090
So we cannot access it if we're not logged in.

279
00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:21.270
Now just to finish,

280
00:15:21.270 --> 00:15:23.750
let's actually log in with some other account

281
00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:28.390
just to see if the administrator part also works.

282
00:15:28.390 --> 00:15:31.320
So let's, again, use Laura here.

283
00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:33.520
And you see that she is just a regular user.

284
00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:42.543
All right.

285
00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:47.950
And now we get her user account, without of course,

286
00:15:47.950 --> 00:15:49.740
the admin menu.

287
00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:51.380
Okay, perfect.

288
00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:53.570
So that is building the account page.

289
00:15:53.570 --> 00:15:55.830
And as I said before, in the next video,

290
00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:57.700
we will then take care of actually

291
00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:00.213
updating these account settings.
