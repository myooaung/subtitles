00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:03.220
<v Narrator>Next up, you're gonna learn how</v>

2
00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:07.150
to integrate a nice map that displays all the locations of

3
00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:11.373
a certain tour into our website using Mapbox.

4
00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:14.150
But before we do that,

5
00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.160
we first need to fix a small Bug that I just found.

6
00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.840
So right now we are in the park camper tour,

7
00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.477
but you see that up here it actually says

8
00:00:23.477 --> 00:00:27.180
"The Forest Hiker" okay? And so,

9
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.991
That's obviously wrong

10
00:00:28.991 --> 00:00:30.260
and so,

11
00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.700
that's because here in our get tour handler,

12
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.900
we are always passing in this title,

13
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.530
so "The Forest Hiker Tour".

14
00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.193
Which of course, is not correct so let's fix that.

15
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.780
Okay, and so let's say here

16
00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.190
tour.name

17
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.283
and then tour.

18
00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.283
Let's make that uppercase actually.

19
00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.150
And so, now we should see "The park camper" tour

20
00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.070
and yeah here it is.

21
00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.740
And now about that map that is going to be

22
00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.050
displayed here in this empty area,

23
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.580
we are gonna use a very nice library called "Mapbox"

24
00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.060
and that library actually runs in the front end.

25
00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.030
And so, in this lecture we are actually going to

26
00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.070
write a little bit of front end code,

27
00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.330
and not so much about the back end.

28
00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.300
But this is still very important because

29
00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.890
now you are gonna learn how to write JavaScript for

30
00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.730
the client side and then integrate that into our templates.

31
00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:32.710
Okay?

32
00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.190
So let's do that

33
00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.130
and first off remember that all the data,

34
00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.140
so all the assets that are available on the client,

35
00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.170
are here in this public folder.

36
00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.830
So for example, our CSS file, our images and

37
00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.050
we also have a folder here for JavaScript.

38
00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.470
And currently that's empty and so let's

39
00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.230
now actually create a new file in here called

40
00:01:58.697 --> 00:02:00.190
Mapbox.js

41
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.525
Okay? And so this basically is a JavaScript file that

42
00:02:06.525 --> 00:02:08.700
we are going to integrate into our HTML and

43
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.250
which will then run on the client side.

44
00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.140
All right? So just like regular JavaScript that

45
00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.340
you've been writing all your life (Laughs) Right?

46
00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.760
But for now, let's simply do some simple console.log here

47
00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.343
before we actually connect it with our back end.

48
00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.540
So let's just say console.log hello from the client side.

49
00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.333
All right,

50
00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.160
and now let's actually integrate it into our templates.

51
00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.290
Now it might appear that the best place to

52
00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.600
do this integration is here in our base template right?

53
00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.220
But in fact, we only want to include the Mapbox script on

54
00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.230
the tour page, right?

55
00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.610
So, how could we do that?

56
00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.070
And the solution for that is once more,

57
00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.040
extending a block here in our base template,

58
00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.190
so I'm going to create a new block here that

59
00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:05.850
we are then gonna extend from the tour. Okay?

60
00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.523
And actually this block will be right here,

61
00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.260
and I'm calling it "head" and

62
00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.093
all of this content will actually be in there.

63
00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.740
Now you might be wondering why we are doing that,

64
00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:20.410
because when we extend the block

65
00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.700
then the content inside that disappears.

66
00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.350
So that's what happened here, right?

67
00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.440
But actually there is another way of extending blocks,

68
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.350
which will then simply add the new content at the end

69
00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.060
or at the beginning of the block.

70
00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.190
All right? So let's see how we can do that.

71
00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.170
And so right at the beginning here of our tour template,

72
00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:42.073
let's now say:

73
00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.120
block head,

74
00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.900
and actually we say block append head, all right?

75
00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.730
And so, whatever we will write in this block here

76
00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.960
will then be appended to the content that's

77
00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.010
already in that block.

78
00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.510
Okay? And we could also use "prepend" and

79
00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.500
then it would be added at the beginning of the block, okay?

80
00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.690
And so now, all we are gonna do here is to

81
00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:08.950
add a new script.

82
00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:11.890
So using a script tag and then specifying the

83
00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.410
source attribute, and so that is

84
00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:20.043
for now "js/mapbox.js"

85
00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:23.760
okay?

86
00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.400
So again, this template here already extends

87
00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.800
our base template,

88
00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.070
and so with this here, we can basically inject

89
00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:33.870
this line of code,

90
00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:37.450
into the head block that is already in our base template.

91
00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:40.930
And so, we append that, and so it will then appear here

92
00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.380
at the end of this head block, so right here.

93
00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.453
And actually let's try that our now.

94
00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:49.053
So when I reload,

95
00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.610
we now should get that message in our console

96
00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.760
and indeed, "Hello from the client side"

97
00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:57.593
Great

98
00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:02.080
So, next up we want to actually get access to

99
00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.850
the location data of the tour that

100
00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:06.140
we are currently trying to display,

101
00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:08.170
right here in the JavaScript file.

102
00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:10.390
So how are going to do that?

103
00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:13.590
Well, then we can do an Ajax request,

104
00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:16.410
so basically a call to our API and

105
00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:17.870
get the data from there.

106
00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:20.760
But that's not really necessary in this case.

107
00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:23.590
And so, let me show you a real nice trick.

108
00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:25.750
So here in our tour template,

109
00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:28.870
we already have all the data about the tour itself

110
00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:30.840
and so now we can simply put that

111
00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.270
data into our HTML so that

112
00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:36.630
JavaScript can then read it from there, okay?

113
00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:39.570
So basically, we are gonna expose the location data,

114
00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:42.327
right here as a string in the HTML and

115
00:05:42.327 --> 00:05:45.080
our JavaScript will then pick it up from there

116
00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:49.500
without having to do, like any API call separately.

117
00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.760
So, lets come down here to our

118
00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:56.270
map class or actually section, okay?

119
00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:59.950
So this section here, and it already has a Diff element with

120
00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:01.460
a map class,

121
00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:05.410
and you will see why it is an ID a bit later

122
00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:08.800
okay? But for now I want to actually specify a

123
00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.870
data attribute here, okay?

124
00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:13.470
So there is a very nice trick in JavaScript where

125
00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:17.030
we can specify a data attribute in HTML,

126
00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:19.580
and then read said attribute using JavaScript

127
00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:21.100
in a very easy way.

128
00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:23.010
And this is how it works,

129
00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:25.710
so we can say "data/" and then here

130
00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:27.730
whatever we want to call it,

131
00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:29.593
in this case we say "locations"

132
00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:36.560
all right? And then we set that to our tour.locations.

133
00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.410
Now before actually doing that

134
00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:42.840
we need to transform that array into a string, right?

135
00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:45.540
So, lets quickly take a look at that.

136
00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:50.170
So our locations is this whole array with

137
00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:51.930
these object in there.

138
00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:55.320
But in HTML, of course we cannot have arrays or

139
00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:58.480
objects or anything like that, and so

140
00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:00.010
what we have to do is to

141
00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:02.740
convert all of that into a string.

142
00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:05.003
And that is fortunately quite easy,

143
00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:11.230
All we have to do is "JSON.stringify "

144
00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:12.513
all right?

145
00:07:13.417 --> 00:07:16.960
And then here tour.location,

146
00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:17.793
or actually that's

147
00:07:17.793 --> 00:07:19.610
locations. All right?

148
00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:21.063
And if we give it now a save,

149
00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:28.040
let's open it up here and inspect this map here,

150
00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:31.120
and so now you see data locations,

151
00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:33.620
and we have this huge string here,

152
00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:36.493
which basically contains all our location data.

153
00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:39.670
All right,

154
00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:42.420
and so, now in our JavaScript

155
00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:44.023
we can get that very easily.

156
00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:49.670
So, locations are at

157
00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:52.983
document.getElementById and

158
00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.810
then map, and now here it goes the part of the trick,

159
00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:04.800
because whatever we put into a data attribute like this,

160
00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:07.820
will then get stored into the dataset property,

161
00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:11.020
and in this case dataset.locations, because

162
00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:15.813
it's called data/ or data- location.

163
00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:20.470
Okay? So just like this,

164
00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:24.823
dataset.locations,

165
00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:26.533
okay?

166
00:08:26.533 --> 00:08:28.210
And now we get all of these errors here

167
00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:29.453
coming from ESlint,

168
00:08:30.347 --> 00:08:33.480
and so that's because ESlint is configured for

169
00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:35.900
Node.js and not for JavaScript ,

170
00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:37.900
and so what we can do here is to

171
00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:40.973
basically disable ESlint for this entire file,

172
00:08:41.923 --> 00:08:46.210
until we say basically with a comment in the beginning here,

173
00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:52.670
ESlint disable and so yes, it will then understand this

174
00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:57.000
and completely turn it off for this entire file, okay?

175
00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.100
So that is the locations data here that

176
00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:01.320
we just put in our HTML,

177
00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:03.460
but remember that that's a string and

178
00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:07.285
so we need to convert it back to JSON, and so

179
00:09:07.285 --> 00:09:09.660
JSON.parse

180
00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:13.683
and then everything that's in here.

181
00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:20.160
All right, and so now let's actually take a look at that

182
00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:22.510
just to see if everything is working correctly.

183
00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:27.823
Let's reload,

184
00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:32.873
and now something went wrong here in our Mapbox file,

185
00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:36.063
well that also seems correct actually,

186
00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:42.120
so let's just test if it actually is called map here

187
00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:47.830
and indeed it is an ID with map,

188
00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:51.160
and so I believe that probably the problem is that

189
00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:53.360
at the time we called

190
00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:55.803
or get element by ID,

191
00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:58.560
so this here,

192
00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:01.210
so probably at this time the DOM is actually

193
00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:04.060
not already loaded, okay? And so that's

194
00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:08.530
because we have our script integrated right at

195
00:10:08.530 --> 00:10:09.963
the beginning of the file,

196
00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:14.300
so this script here is right in the head,

197
00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:17.580
while it really should be at the bottom of the page. Okay?

198
00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:19.760
So let me actually copy this one here and

199
00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:21.720
put it manually in the base,

200
00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:24.580
so I'll copy it and comment it out,

201
00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:27.610
but don't worry we will actually still use

202
00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:31.270
this block append technique here a bit later in the video,

203
00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:34.100
because there is some stuff coming from Mapbox that

204
00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:35.750
we still need to put in the head,

205
00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:40.170
okay? But for now let's just actually put this

206
00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:42.483
script here right at the bottom of the page.

207
00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:45.433
Okay?

208
00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:48.750
That (Laughs) of course,

209
00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:51.200
I just wanted to go to another file,

210
00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:54.360
so I could save it so that the server actually reloads

211
00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:56.180
because these pug files,

212
00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:57.880
as you've probably have noticed here,

213
00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:00.610
they do not trigger a restart

214
00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:03.010
of our server, all right?

215
00:11:03.010 --> 00:11:06.805
Anyway, I'm hopeful that now it's going to work

216
00:11:06.805 --> 00:11:09.150
and indeed, it does.

217
00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:11.070
So we have an array here,

218
00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:15.060
and indeed these are the four locations of our tour.

219
00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:18.190
Okay so now we have everything nicely integrated,

220
00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:21.170
and all ready to integrate Mapbox and

221
00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:23.010
create our own map here.

222
00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:25.960
But in order to not create a too long video,

223
00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:28.113
I will actually do that in the next one.
