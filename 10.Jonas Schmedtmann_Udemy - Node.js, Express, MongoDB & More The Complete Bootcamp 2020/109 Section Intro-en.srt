00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:05,900
<v ->So I've been saying multiple times now</v>

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:09,340
that we need a better error-handling strategy, right,

4
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:12,410
and so now it's time to finally build it.

5
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:15,460
And error handling is a really important aspect

6
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:17,600
of any backend application,

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,320
which is the whole reason why error handling

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,530
even got its own section in this course.

9
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:25,270
So, in this section, I'm gonna show you

10
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:28,900
how we can use Express and environment variables

11
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:32,160
to build quite a robust error-handling workflow

12
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,210
that you can then use for your own applications

13
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:36,083
in the future.
