00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:04.120
<v Instructor>So now that we understand the basics of PUG,</v>

2
00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.620
it's time to do some refactoring and to

3
00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.160
fit our code better into the NVC architecture.

4
00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.490
And so that after that, we can finally

5
00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:14.603
start building the website itself.

6
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.790
And just like we did with our resources,

7
00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:20.680
I'm also going to create a router

8
00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.030
and a controller for the views.

9
00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:26.210
So basically a file where I can put all the routes

10
00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.123
that we need in order to build our dynamic website.

11
00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.340
So let's call this the view

12
00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.610
routes.

13
00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:38.443
Okay.

14
00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.423
And let's start by requiring express.

15
00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:51.463
Okay.

16
00:00:51.463 --> 00:00:52.960
And so this is going to work the exact

17
00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.023
same way as the other routers.

18
00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:57.790
So creating a router

19
00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.533
express dot.

20
00:01:03.538 --> 00:01:07.083
A router and then by the end, we export it.

21
00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.460
And so now, lets actually get these routes here

22
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.710
and copy them into the routes file.

23
00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.210
Now here it's of course, no longer app, but router.

24
00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:30.553
So let's replace that.

25
00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:33.800
Alright.

26
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.990
And so that's actually okay.

27
00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.610
So in the other routes, we used to use d dot route

28
00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.130
where we then specified the route itself

29
00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.720
and then after that, we used like get, post, patch,

30
00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.900
or delete, so all these http methods.

31
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.320
But in this case, that's not going to be necessary

32
00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.810
because all we're ever going to do is to use get.

33
00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.200
And so it's good like this.

34
00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.620
Next up, we actually need to mount this

35
00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:01.423
router to our application.

36
00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.830
So here, in the app, and so just like we did before,

37
00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.573
we start by requiring it.

38
00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.803
So, view router.

39
00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.438
And now, let's actually mount it,

40
00:02:18.438 --> 00:02:20.938
here right past the first one.

41
00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:25.822
So view router, but the difference of this one

42
00:02:25.822 --> 00:02:30.822
is that this is actually mounted right on the route URL.

43
00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.350
Okay, so whenever a URL looks like this,

44
00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.110
it will go straight into the view router.

45
00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.650
And I'm not sure if that's going to work.

46
00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.770
Maybe we will have to put it here at the end.

47
00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:43.723
But let's see, once we test that.

48
00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:46.010
Okay.

49
00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.600
Now just as a final step, let's, just like before,

50
00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.540
actually export these functions here into a controller.

51
00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.640
And so, just like before,

52
00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.623
let's create a views controller.

53
00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.310
Alright.

54
00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.543
And so that's copied and stuff.

55
00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:14.303
So this one here is going to be called the get overview.

56
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.800
So export dot get overview

57
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.210
equals this function, okay.

58
00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:27.410
For now at least.

59
00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.230
So of course all of this here,

60
00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.890
we're going to be replaced with the real controller

61
00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.220
which is actually going to get the data for the overview

62
00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.030
and then render that data.

63
00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.410
Okay, but for now, we just have this very simple

64
00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.963
controller function just to see if everything works.

65
00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.300
Alright, so lets now actually go

66
00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.273
add and import that controller here.

67
00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:04.223
So controllers and then views controller.

68
00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:09.230
Okay, and so here, we will have views controller

69
00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:14.320
dot get overview, alright.

70
00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:15.913
And now, here the same.

71
00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:22.543
Export dot get tour.

72
00:04:26.056 --> 00:04:26.889
Okay.

73
00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.100
And this one here was actually just a test.

74
00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.220
So lets get rid of it.

75
00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.150
And now, finally we actually do not want a route

76
00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:45.950
called overview but instead,

77
00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:49.040
we want to show the overview right when we open the page.

78
00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.380
Okay, so just like we have it here.

79
00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.920
So this is the route page and whenever that is requested,

80
00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.570
it will serve this overview page.

81
00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:02.343
Okay, and so that's exactly what we want in our application.

82
00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:08.290
Alright, so lets test it out.

83
00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:11.083
And so this one here should now be the overview page.

84
00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:16.230
And indeed, it is, okay.

85
00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:18.930
And now here, lets reload this one as well

86
00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.420
just to see if everything still works.

87
00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:24.400
And it does, great.

88
00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.723
And of course, we could still access our API as well.

89
00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:33.403
So lets say API, V1,

90
00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:35.293
slash tours.

91
00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:38.860
And that should then give us all of our tours

92
00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:40.963
and that we return for this endpoint.

93
00:05:41.832 --> 00:05:42.665
Okay.

94
00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:45.690
Fantastic, so with this,

95
00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:48.070
we're actually ready to really start building

96
00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:50.450
this overview page in the next lecture.

97
00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:52.183
So I can't wait to see you there.
