00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:12.620
In this section we'll talk about keywords identifiers punctuation operators and syntax in programming

2
00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:13.820
languages.

3
00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:20.090
Most languages have keywords keywords are part of the vocabulary of a programming language in most languages

4
00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:22.230
the keywords are also reserved.

5
00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:27.080
This means that you the programmer cannot redefine their meaning and you can't use them in a way in

6
00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.930
which they were not intended.

7
00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:36.290
C++ has lots of keywords in a browser I've opened up a web page for CGP reference dot com that lists

8
00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.950
the C++ keywords without a frame of reference.

9
00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.420
It's difficult to know that this is a lot of keywords.

10
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.080
There are around 90 keywords in C++

11
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.530
Java has around 50

12
00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:58.010
C has 32 and Python has 33.

13
00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.140
90 is a lot of keywords now.

14
00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.490
In general the more keywords that a language has the more complex the programming language grammar.

15
00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.890
However there are many keywords in C++ that are rarely used.

16
00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.570
I've been using C++ for a very long time and there are some keywords in this list that I've never used.

17
00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.280
There's no need to sit down and memorize all these keywords will use the keywords as we need them and

18
00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.100
you'll learn them along the way.

19
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:29.040
Notice that some of the keywords in this list we've already used for example we've used it and we've

20
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.540
used return years and right here and Heeres return right here.

21
00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:36.930
We use that in our first program.

22
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:45.750
Also notice that LB include main favorite number standard and line C in and C out are not in this list.

23
00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.490
That's because they're not keywords.

24
00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.200
We'll talk about them next.

25
00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:55.110
What's important to remember here is that C++ has a set of keywords that it's defined in the language

26
00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.270
and these words are reserved.

27
00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.630
Now let's go to code light and see the reserve words in our first program.

28
00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:07.110
So going back and code later I'm looking at the same program that we did in the previous section.

29
00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:13.960
The one with the favorite number you can see that I mentioned that main and LB include in favorite number

30
00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.330
and so forth were not keywords.

31
00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.320
Same with standard out c out C in and so forth than in line all of these.

32
00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.080
These are not keywords.

33
00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:30.050
These are called identifiers and there's an important distinction between identifiers and keywords and

34
00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:37.210
identifier is something that the programmer names these names have been created by programmers to create

35
00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.290
something that represents something meaningful to them.

36
00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.780
There are rules about how to name identifiers and will go into all those in the later section.

37
00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.010
C++ also has operators it's got a lot of operators.

38
00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.480
It's got the operators that you used to.

39
00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.310
In addition multiplication subtraction division and so forth.

40
00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:59.860
But in this case we're using some nonstandard operators for example this guy right here that little

41
00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.300
Chevron is this dream insertion operator.

42
00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:08.200
We're going to insert whatever's on the right hand side of it into that stream in this case it's an

43
00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.200
output stream that gets displayed to the console.

44
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.270
Same thing with the string extraction operator.

45
00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.290
This one takes something from the console and stores it into a variable.

46
00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:23.320
In this case favorite number there is also that double colon right here.

47
00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:28.060
That's the scope resolution operator will talk about all of these operators as we go on to Section 9

48
00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.250
in the course.

49
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:37.300
C++ also has punctuation things like semi-colons at the end of statements Curley's open and close quotes

50
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:45.730
parentheses it's got all kinds of punctuation when you put all of these elements together in a program

51
00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:54.230
you end up with something called syntax syntax is the syntax of the programming language the structure

52
00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.250
and the meaning of what you want the compiler to understand.

53
00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:04.010
The compiler is taking your code and translating it to machine code and it's translated here based on

54
00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.140
what you told it you wanted to be done.

55
00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:07.700
It's not going to guess.

56
00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:11.390
This may sound a little intimidating at this point but it comes pretty quickly with a little bit of

57
00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:12.190
practice.

58
00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:14.280
Well that completes this video in the next video.

59
00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:19.530
We'll talk about the C++ preprocessor and we'll learn more about that preprocessor directive pounde

60
00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:20.060
include.
