C++ has a rich set of operators they can be used to build up expressions.

2
00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:16.940
Most of the C++ operators are binary operators which means they operate on two operands.

3
00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.660
For example the multiplication operator.

4
00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.820
However some are you know three operators which means they operate on only one operand.

5
00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:31.120
An example of this is the unitary minus operator which simply negates its operand.

6
00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.500
There's even a turn every operator that operates on three operands.

7
00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:41.310
This is the conditional operator the C plus plus common operators can be grouped into several categories.

8
00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:47.230
Assignment operators are used to modify the value of some object by assigning a new value to it.

9
00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:54.210
Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations on operands the increment and decrement

10
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.620
operators are interesting because part of them worked like an assignment and part of them worked like

11
00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.270
arithmetic.

12
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:06.880
They're super useful and very commonly used relational operators or comparison operators allow you to

13
00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.460
compare the values of two objects.

14
00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:16.450
These are very useful and include equal to not equal to less than greater than and so forth the logical

15
00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.420
operators are used to test for logical or boolean conditions.

16
00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:26.260
For example if you want to execute a specific statement only when the temperature is less than freezing

17
00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:27.700
and it isn't snowing.

18
00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.230
These include the logical not and and or operators.

19
00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:34.510
There are also several member access operators.

20
00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:35.870
We've already seen one of them.

21
00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.890
Remember the array subscript OPERATOR It allows access to a specific member.

22
00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.190
There are others that work with objects and pointers which we'll cover later in this course.

23
00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.420
Finally there's the other category.

24
00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.900
This includes those operators that really don't fit very well into the previous categories.

25
00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.950
And the next several videos we'll head over to code like and see some examples of these operators in

26
00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:57.660
live code.
