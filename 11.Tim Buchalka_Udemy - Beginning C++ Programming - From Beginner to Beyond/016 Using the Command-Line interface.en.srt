00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:13,150
In this section we'll look at how we can create build and execute C++ programs using only a simple editor

2
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,930
and the command line.

3
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:18,240
All we need on our system is a simple text editor.

4
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:24,560
It's important to note that word processors such as Microsoft Word and Apple pages are not usually used

5
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,180
to enter program code.

6
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:32,900
Instead we use basic text editors or programmers text editors these types of editors are much simpler

7
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:36,050
than integrated development environments.

8
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:40,250
We also need an installed C++ compiler like GCC or Ms.

9
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:44,200
GW on Windows and Apple's command line compilers on Mac.

10
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,620
That's it.

11
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:51,950
At this point we can create the C++ program using the text editor and compile and run it by typing commands

12
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:53,420
into the command line.

13
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:57,760
This may sound intimidating at first but it's actually quite easy and efficient.

14
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:02,750
That said this is a workflow that's more commonly seen with experienced developers.

15
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:08,060
However you may wish to consider this approach if you find the ideas too complex or too difficult to

16
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:09,020
understand.

17
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:14,000
You might also consider this approach if your computer hardware resources are insufficient to run an

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,090
idea.

19
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:20,180
In any case this is another option that you may use in the next several videos.

20
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:26,970
I'll show you how to edit build and execute C++ programs using only the command line and a simple editor.

21
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:31,580
There will be separate videos for Windows Macs and Ubuntu Linux for your reference.
