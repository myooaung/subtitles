00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.890
In this section of the Course will go over the control structures that allow you to control the flow

2
00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:13.350
of execution in your program.

3
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:16.340
So far you've learned how to write programs that run sequentially.

4
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.590
That is one statement followed by another and so forth.

5
00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.840
You can solve many problems using sequence but now is when we really take advantage of the power of

6
00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:25.680
programming.

7
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:32.730
In this section we'll go over the selection and iteration control structures in C++ selection control

8
00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.430
structures allow you to make decisions and execute parts of your program only when certain conditions

9
00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.010
are true or false.

10
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.100
This is so powerful and opens up a world of programming power.

11
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.590
After we learn about the selection constructs we'll learn about the iteration control structures.

12
00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:54.070
These are the constructs that let us loop and repeat parts of our program.

13
00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:01.230
So we have these three basic programming building blocks sequence selection and iteration with sequence

14
00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.790
selection and iteration.

15
00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.330
We can implement any algorithm.

16
00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:09.280
Let me repeat that with sequence selection and iteration.

17
00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.170
We can implement any algorithm that's amazing.

18
00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.030
Let's see some of the C++ selection statements.

19
00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:23.670
The main selection powerhouse in most programming languages is the if statement if a condition is true

20
00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:25.170
then you do something.

21
00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.640
We can also add the failing condition to an if statement and get the if else statement.

22
00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:35.790
In this case if a condition is true you do something and if the condition is false you do something

23
00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:36.370
else.

24
00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.640
So you're basically making a simple binary decision.

25
00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.970
We can also nest if statements 1 inside the other.

26
00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:51.600
For example if my favorite football team is playing today then if the game is on now then record it.

27
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.360
Sometimes if statements get pretty long and complex so C++ has a switch statement that has some benefits

28
00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.720
when we're comparing integer based discrete elements.

29
00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.020
Finally C++ has a really neat operator called the conditional operator.

30
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.950
That's basically an if statement wrapped up in an operator will go over all of the selection control

31
00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.850
flow constructs in detail.

32
00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.180
Then we'll look at the iteration or looping constructs.

33
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.150
C++ has three basic looping constructs.

34
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.050
The for loop.

35
00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.070
The while loop and the do while loop.

36
00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.330
There is also a range based for loop.

37
00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.560
That's great to use with ranges of items and collections of items like arrays and vectors.

38
00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.850
We can control how many times we loop in many ways to continue and break statements allow us to read

39
00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.640
loop and break out of loops whenever we want.

40
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.000
Finally we'll talk about the infinite loop.

41
00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.880
That's a loop that loops forever.

42
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.600
Well at least until we break out of it and nested loops these are loops within loops that are great

43
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.080
for working with multi dimensional structures like two dimensional arrays or vectors.

44
00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.290
Everything you've learned up to this point will now be used with these control structures.

45
00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.160
Variable declarations assignment.

46
00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.500
Testing for equality relational and logical operators and more.

47
00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.210
Let's get started and learn these powerful constructs.
