00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:09.370
OK so welcome to the Section 8 challenge solution.

2
00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:14.560
I hope you were able to solve this problem and I hope it was fun to do and I hope you tested it and

3
00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.270
tweaked it made it your own added some features to it and so forth.

4
00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.350
Let me just go through a couple of solutions.

5
00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:24.030
First we'll do the solution without using the modular operator.

6
00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.780
So I'm going to scroll up here and let me just explain what I've got going on.

7
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:29.510
Here's my main right at the beginning.

8
00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:37.210
OK so I've defined conversion constants these are just simple integers and it's de-value in cents of

9
00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.230
a dollar a quarter a dime and a nickel.

10
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.670
And so a dollar is 100 cents a quarter is 25 cents and so forth.

11
00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.300
Then I've got another integer called Change amount.

12
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.600
This is what I'm asking the user to enter.

13
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:56.840
All right so let's suppose that we're entering 1:51 here and we'll walk through a simple example here

14
00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.010
I'm declaring all the variables and I'm going to need Dalia's quarters dimes nickels and pennies are

15
00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.870
going to contain the number of dollars quarters dimes nickels and pennies that I need to provide the

16
00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:11.480
change and then I'm going to have another variable called balance and that's going to be a balance of

17
00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.370
running balance every time that I figure out I need $2 and I'm going to subtract $2 from the original

18
00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.890
amount.

19
00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.540
And so I get down to zero.

20
00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:26.520
OK so that's my my algorithm or my solution is basically to determine how much have the highest currency

21
00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.560
I need and then subtract that and have a running balance till it becomes zero.

22
00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:35.340
So let's do this example here and I'm just going to write some letters over here all right.

23
00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.580
Dalia's quarters dimes nickels and pennies.

24
00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:44.190
So we can keep it running and we'll have a balanced variable here as well.

25
00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.360
All right.

26
00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:53.220
So let's start with Ratterman here on 9:57 and we need to figure out how many dollars are in 92 cents.

27
00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.800
Well there are none right.

28
00:01:54.830 --> 00:02:00.020
So what we want to do is we want to divide the change amount which in this case is 92.

29
00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.520
Divide that by the dollar value which is 100 cents per dollar.

30
00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.860
In this case that's going to give me a zero.

31
00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:08.920
Remember we're using integer division here.

32
00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:14.900
So I'm going to get to zero which says no dollars makes sense right because I've got less than 100 cents

33
00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:16.410
now.

34
00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.430
I need to update my balance.

35
00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.400
Well how do I do that.

36
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.470
A debt criminate however many dollars times 100.

37
00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.100
Well I had zero here right.

38
00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:35.260
So in this case the change amount is going to be 92 and I'm going to subtract from that zero times 100.

39
00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.690
OK so in this case I'm not attracting anything.

40
00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.840
My balance becomes 92 OK.

41
00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.230
So that's the first step.

42
00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.660
Now we need to determine how many quarters we need.

43
00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:51.000
So I don't want to take that balance which is 92 and I'm going to divide it by the quarter's value which

44
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.640
is 25 cents.

45
00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.700
And that would give me a three right 75 cents.

46
00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.300
So I need three quarters.

47
00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.800
Now what I want to do is I want to subtract that 75 cents from the 92.

48
00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.640
And in this case I'm using a compound OPERATOR Right here the minus equals.

49
00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:12.540
So all I'm saying is balance equals balance minus the right hand side while the right hand side is three

50
00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.070
quarters times.

51
00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:15.810
Twenty five cents each.

52
00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.400
Which is the seventy five.

53
00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.900
OK so I'm going to subtract seventy five from the balance which is going to give me 17.

54
00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.810
So that's my current balance.

55
00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.510
Now I can work on the dimes how many dimes.

56
00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:32.250
Well it's the balance which is seventeen divided by 10 cents per dime.

57
00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.100
So this is going to give me one.

58
00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:40.090
So that's one dime and I'm going to do the same thing here hopefully you can see what's going on.

59
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:45.550
I'm going to subtract one dime which is 10 cents each from the balance somewhat Subtract ten from the

60
00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:48.450
balance gives me seven.

61
00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:50.470
Now I'm going to figure out how many nickels I need.

62
00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.320
Seven divided by five cents per nickel.

63
00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.490
So I need one nickel.

64
00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.750
I subtract five from the seven.

65
00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.540
And I end up with two.

66
00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:02.730
My balance is the number of pennies I need.

67
00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:04.650
I don't need to do any more calculations.

68
00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.790
And that gives me two pennies and we're basically done.

69
00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.970
So if we if we add up all of this let's test this out.

70
00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:12.940
This is going to give me zero.

71
00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:19.910
This is going to give me twenty five times three which is 75 cents.

72
00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:21.460
This will give me the 75.

73
00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:28.570
This will give me 10 one times 10 one times five and two times one for I and all those guys up I should

74
00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:34.590
have 75 85 92 exactly what I expected OK.

75
00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:40.070
So that gives you an example of one way to approach this if we will do it really quickly with another

76
00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:44.000
example here let's say we wanted to use something like 267.

77
00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:48.760
So let me clear this and I'll go through this one really quickly this time.

78
00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:52.510
So let's say it's 267 is the amount that the user entered.

79
00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.460
OK.

80
00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:56.520
So here how many dollars.

81
00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:06.990
Well 267 divided by one hundred right 100 cents per dollar that's going to give me $2 than what I want

82
00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:14.730
to do is I want to subtract I'll run my balance appear those two hundred which gives me 67 cents.

83
00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:15.830
That's my balance.

84
00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.300
How many quarters in 67 cents.

85
00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:22.470
Divide that by 25.

86
00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:28.620
That gives me two quarters which is 50 cents I'm subtracting 50 cents and we're right back to where

87
00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:31.450
we were with the other problem where we've got 17.

88
00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:32.830
How many times.

89
00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:34.170
Divide that by 10.

90
00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:38.420
Gives me one dime that's 10 cents I subtract 10 from that.

91
00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:40.270
I end up with seven.

92
00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:41.610
How many nickels.

93
00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:42.810
Divide that by five.

94
00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:49.400
That gives me the one nickel and I've got two left which is my pennies.

95
00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:49.770
Right.

96
00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:55.470
So this gives us right here one hundred times two it gives us 200.

97
00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:06.210
This gives me 50 excuse me 10 5 and to add all that up I get to 50 to 60 to 70 I'm sorry 200 250 to

98
00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:11.260
seven which is exactly what we started up with.

99
00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:12.220
OK.

100
00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:14.510
Now we can take advantage of something here.

101
00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:20.540
If you notice if I have 267 and I divide that by 100.

102
00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:24.470
Let's say that gives me $2 integer division.

103
00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:28.390
But notice that I have a remainder my remainder is 67 right.

104
00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:32.380
That's where we can use the modular operator to rework this a little bit.

105
00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.050
So we'll do that next.

106
00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:39.750
OK so let's look at another solution this time will be using the modulo operator.

107
00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:49.260
So suppose the user enters 267 for the change amount and I've put all these on the same file.

108
00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.460
That way you can play around with both of them a lot easier.

109
00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:56.340
So in this case I'm zeroing everything out just like when we started.

110
00:06:56.340 --> 00:07:02.730
So I've got 267 sets is what the users entered and which is keep a running total over here for the dollars

111
00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:06.520
the quarters dimes nickels and pennies.

112
00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:07.240
OK.

113
00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:08.360
So how many dollars.

114
00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:15.060
Well we divide 267 by 100 cents per dollar and that gives us the $2.

115
00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:21.200
So we definitely need that now rather than subtract the two times 100 from the 267 as we did before.

116
00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:23.910
We can take advantage of the modulo operator.

117
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:30.100
So in this case the change amounted to 67 maade 100.

118
00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:30.720
Right.

119
00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:35.020
This gives us 2 with the remainder of 67.

120
00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:40.360
So the effect is exactly like subtracting 200 from 267.

121
00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:44.580
So what we can do is we'll keep our balance down here this time just to have a little bit more room

122
00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:45.720
in this case.

123
00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:48.270
Our balance is going to be 67.

124
00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:50.180
That's what we just decide right here.

125
00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:53.920
Now let's figure out how many quarters we have.

126
00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:56.220
Well our balance is 67.

127
00:07:56.220 --> 00:08:00.600
Divide that by 25 cents per quarter and that gives us 2 quarters.

128
00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:07.830
So now again instead of subtracting 50 from 67 we could just use the module operator here I'm using

129
00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:12.230
the compound operator so its balance equals balance maade quarter value.

130
00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:13.530
Same idea.

131
00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:21.490
So balance is 67 maade 25 gives us 2 quarters right.

132
00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:24.730
That's 50 with the remainder of 17.

133
00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:30.520
So our balance becomes 17 and then from this point forward I think you could see what's happening.

134
00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:35.680
Our balance is now 17 divided by 10 cents per dime.

135
00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:45.230
Gives us one dime and then we do the same modular OPERATOR So we're going to have 17 mide 10 gives us

136
00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:47.080
one with the remainder of 7.

137
00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:50.140
That's really what we care about as a remainder in this case.

138
00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:51.670
How many nickels.

139
00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:55.030
Seven divided by five cents per nickel.

140
00:08:55.040 --> 00:09:02.120
It gives us one nickel and then we do the Mada operator one last time we're going to say the balance

141
00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:09.610
would be 7 which is my balance maade 5 which gives me a one with the remainder of 2.

142
00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:13.630
At that point our balance is to which is the number of pennies that are left.

143
00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:19.550
And again if we add this up we're going to have $2 here which is 200.

144
00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:31.530
We've got 50 cents here 10 cents here 5 cents here and 2 cents here which gives us 200 250 267.

145
00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:34.190
Another approach to me this approach are clear.

146
00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.960
So it's not so cluttered request.

147
00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:42.520
To me this approach as I read it looks easier to follow than the other approach but they're both really

148
00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:46.070
doing the same thing is just a matter of preference and documentation.

149
00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:47.420
So that's it.

150
00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:50.780
I hope these two solutions were pretty close to yours.
