00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:10,900
Hello everyone in this video I'd like to show you how to use the source code that's provided with the

2
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:11,700
course.

3
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:19,150
Each section of the Course contains a compressed zip file that contains a workspace and all the projects

4
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:21,150
that I've created in that workspace.

5
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:26,370
So for example Suppose it were working on Section 8 will be a Section 8 zip file.

6
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:29,310
It may be a different name but it'll have everything you need in there.

7
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:35,320
And once you can do here is just extract that file and I'll extract here and I'm simply going to extract

8
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,700
it right to my desktop.

9
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:41,990
You can see the folders have all been extracted.

10
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:46,190
So if I double click on Section 8 you can see all the projects in there.

11
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:50,540
Now there's one special file you'll see done at the bottom here it's called Section 8 and it's a workspace

12
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:51,240
file.

13
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:58,350
If you right click on that you can open with code like and open up the workspace in code like.

14
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:02,170
And once the workspace is open you have access to all the projects in there.

15
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:03,590
So that's one way to do it.

16
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:07,670
Another way to do this is once you've extracted the file just open code like

17
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:11,070
OK.

18
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:15,330
So now once code light is opened you can choose to open a workspace right over here.

19
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:21,280
So select that open workspace and then you can just navigate to the workspace you want to open in this

20
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:21,820
case.

21
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:27,070
It's an it's Section 8 workspace you just simply select that file and you can see the workspace opens

22
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:28,780
up right here with all your projects.

23
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:33,550
Now I'm going to close the workspace and show you another way to do it would be right up here you just

24
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:34,660
come to workspace.

25
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:40,090
If you have a workspace that's already open you can simply workspace close.

26
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:44,050
It wouldn't be great out to be right there in this case I just want to open a workspace.

27
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:49,550
And I again you navigate to the workspace you want to open select it and there it is.

28
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:55,940
So now I've got Section 8 workspace with all the projects that I created and provided for you in order

29
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:59,300
to run these projects you simply double click the project you are interested in.

30
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:05,630
So suppose I'm interested in this uro's project you can see the source code and all you really need

31
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:07,410
to do is build and run.

32
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:12,060
But I'd suggest that you clean it first especially if you're going from Windows to PC to Linux.

33
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:17,180
I'm developing on Windows you're on a Mac or Linux machine or even a Windows machine it's always a good

34
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:22,970
idea to clean the project and what you can do you can right click and clean or you can come up to here

35
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:28,970
where it says build clean or clean the project that removes all the object files that X Files and just

36
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:33,510
gets rid of a bunch of stuff that you may need depending on your system.

37
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:41,600
Now that we've got that ready we can simply build and run and we should be get to go euros to us dollars

38
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,200
so we'll type in 100.

39
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,650
$119 is 100 euros.

40
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:46,420
So that's it.

41
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,200
It's really pretty straightforward.

42
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:53,740
What I would suggest is you create obviously your ordinate way of organizing your files.

43
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:59,030
I'd use folders or directory structures and also something that's important to understand as well with

44
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:01,260
code like code like does things a little differently.

45
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:08,330
So suppose that you've got projects in another workspace and then you select the workspace here and

46
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:10,440
you say add existing project.

47
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:15,080
Well what happens here is it doesn't actually copy that project into the workspace.

48
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:20,530
It'll create a new project in this workspace but the files will still be where they were before.

49
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:25,580
So you see Peepy files in your header files and everything will still be where they were.

50
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:29,570
So think of this more of a logical project rather than a physical copy of it.

51
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,320
OK but once you play around with it you'll understand exactly what's going on.

52
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,060
So really straightforward.

53
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:37,690
You've got the zip files that we're providing.

54
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,680
Unzip them.

55
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,070
You have a folder structure and then just open that workspace file in there.

56
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,500
All your projects should come in no problem at all.
