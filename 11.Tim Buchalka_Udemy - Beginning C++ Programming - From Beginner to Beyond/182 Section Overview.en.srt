00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:11,130
In this section of the course we'll see how we can use polymorphism in inheritance to provide us with

2
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:15,560
the power to create reusable and flexible programs.

3
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:20,100
We'll start by understanding the different types of polymorphism available in C++.

4
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:26,490
And then we'll focus on dynamic polymorphism in this section Some will learn how to use base class pointers

5
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:32,220
to really take our class hierarchies to a new level and see how we can now think more abstractly and

6
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:36,380
not have to worry about details throughout this section of the course.

7
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:41,370
We'll see examples of static and dynamic binding of function calls and we'll understand the pros and

8
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:42,880
cons of each.

9
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:46,670
Then we'll use virtual functions to achieve polymorphic functions.

10
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:49,940
That is functions that are bound at runtime.

11
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:52,700
We'll see how important it is to have virtual structures.

12
00:00:52,770 --> 00:01:00,570
We'll see how important it is to have virtual destructors and use the C++ 11 override and final specifiers.

13
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:06,420
Then we'll see how we can use base class references to also achieve dynamic polymorphism.

14
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:11,430
Finally we'll learn what pure virtual functions and abstract classes are and why we would want to use

15
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:14,670
them as is and in interfaces is a lot to cover.

16
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:19,700
But I think you'll find this section pretty easy to grasp since you have a pretty solid foundation already.

17
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:21,960
So let's get started with polymorphism.
