00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:06,230
Welcome back.

2
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:08,800
I hope you had fun trying to solve the problem.

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,900
I'm sure you did great as you noticed in the work space that created the challenge which has created

4
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:15,450
an empty shell for the problem.

5
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:19,320
And I've also got the challenge solution which has my solution to the problem.

6
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:23,620
OK so let's start looking at the code here we know we had to solve.

7
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:28,390
So let's look at some of these really simple statements first and I'll mark this up just so easy for

8
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:29,420
you to follow.

9
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:36,340
So in this case I'm simply putting welcome that I've defined a variable here which is going to hold

10
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:42,880
small rooms and I've initialized to zero that's the best practice I'm prompting the user and I'm asking

11
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:48,760
them to put in the number of small rooms they want and I'm doing exactly the same thing here except

12
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:55,070
we're doing large rooms and now we've got to define two declared constants right.

13
00:00:55,090 --> 00:01:00,460
We're going to declare one is the price for a small room and one is the price for a large room 25 and

14
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,470
35 respectively.

15
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:07,360
We've got our sales tax declared constant here and we've got our estimate expert constant.

16
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:09,340
So so far so good.

17
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:11,140
It's exactly the same as we did before.

18
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:13,340
The only thing is I'm adding the barge rooms.

19
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:14,000
Okay.

20
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:19,000
So let me clear this and I'll scroll up just a little bit and take a look at some of the calculations

21
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:24,040
here are some of the outputs statements and you can see here I'm asked about putting the number of small

22
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:28,060
rooms which is just whatever the user typed in and the number of larger rooms which is whatever they

23
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:33,940
typed in the price per small room and the price per barge room right here those are our declared constants

24
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:35,290
which I'm outputting.

25
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:40,600
Now the cost the calculation is really simple it's the cost of the small rooms plus the costs of the

26
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:45,980
large rooms and we calculate each one by price per small room times the number of small rooms.

27
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:48,080
Plus there's a plus sign.

28
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:52,420
Or you can split these across lines so you can line up the insertion operators like that and make some

29
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:53,700
nice and easy to read.

30
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,610
So in this case I'm just calculating the cost for the small rooms and I'm adding the cost of the large

31
00:01:58,610 --> 00:01:59,770
rooms to it.

32
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:06,220
Same thing with tax I'm calculating the cost again and I'm multiplying the whole thing by sales tax.

33
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:11,080
Notice that I've got those parentheses here because what I want to do is I want to calculate the whole

34
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:14,510
cost and then multiply that by the sales tax.

35
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:17,430
Otherwise I won't get the correct answer.

36
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,130
Make sure the whole thing is here.

37
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:25,220
So this becomes all the small costs plus all the large costs.

38
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:26,350
Okay.

39
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:32,240
Then finally the total estimate just takes the cost and adds the sales tax to it.

40
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:33,570
That's it.

41
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:35,370
The estimate is valid for 30 days.

42
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:40,840
And there's my program so you can see that my formatting is going to be a little bit different from

43
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:44,980
your formatting and mine might be a little bit more readable because you may not have split things across

44
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:46,180
lines like I did.

45
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:51,610
It's good practice to split these across lines that we can really see what's going on and it's much

46
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:52,910
much easier to follow.

47
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:53,500
OK.

48
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,410
Well I hope you enjoyed the challenge and I hope you did well.

49
00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:01,410
Remember there's a lot of duplicated code here that we're going to clean up as the course progresses.

50
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:06,010
And this program will actually modify this program a little bit later on when we use functions.

51
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:06,550
OK.

52
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:07,850
So that's it for the challenge.
