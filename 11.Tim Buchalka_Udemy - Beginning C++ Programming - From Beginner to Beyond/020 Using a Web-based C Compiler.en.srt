00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:11,670
This video show you a couple of options that allow you to run your C++ programs read in a web browser.

2
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:16,630
This is pretty nice because sometimes we're on the road you don't have your computer with you and you

3
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:21,640
want to take the course and try out some examples maybe you had an idea about an example you want to

4
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:25,750
try it up and nothing is available or to your friends house and there's no computer available there

5
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:27,370
except the browser.

6
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:29,650
All you need is a browser to run these.

7
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:36,480
One example is if you open up your favorite browser using Chrome here you can type in c p p s h that

8
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,570
C U R L and you get the C plus plus shell.

9
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:45,160
Now both of these examples I'm going to show you are rather limited compared to obviously running on

10
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:50,560
your own computer with an idea and so forth but they're really really handy when you need to try something

11
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,010
out really quickly without having to install a thing.

12
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:59,620
So in this case SH is the C++ shell you could type your program right in here on the browser and you

13
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:04,830
could see here I've typed in the hello world program and you could set options so you can set your C

14
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:11,560
plus plus 14 options your warnings to w all like we have in the examples and if you want to run your

15
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:15,790
program you can just select Run and it's going to compile and run it at the same time which is pretty

16
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:16,990
nice.

17
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:22,770
Also if the program asks for input which will get to a little bit later in the course you can sit that

18
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:27,210
to interactive mode so it'll be able to be able to type into the program which is kind of nice as well.

19
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:33,820
So in this case I want to run the program and you could see it's compiling program is running and the

20
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:38,550
output is hello world right here and the exit code is 0 which is our return 0.

21
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:40,150
That's pretty nice.

22
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:46,570
Now you can get a U R L which gets a u r l to what you did and you can click on that you were all you

23
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:47,950
got the program that you wrote back.

24
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:50,190
So that's obviously it storing it somewhere.

25
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:54,440
I'm not sure where or how long it's going to be available but you could figure that out if you like.

26
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:55,810
That's one example.

27
00:01:55,810 --> 00:02:00,030
Another example is web compiler Dom cloud app.

28
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:05,620
This is a visual C++ compiler running in the web hits from Microsoft compiler and you can see that they've

29
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,690
given you a sample program here.

30
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:09,170
Now this text is pretty small.

31
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:10,120
Again it's a browser.

32
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,140
I'm going to make my browser a little bit bigger.

33
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:15,650
So you can see it and then make it a little smaller again to run it.

34
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:20,320
So you could see here it's including IO stream it's using a name space which we'll talk about a little

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:23,440
bit later and it's outputting Hello world.

36
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,820
And that might make this a little smaller again so when you run the program by clicking this purple

37
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:31,320
button down here there's your output right up here and this black window here.

38
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:32,560
Hello world.

39
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,490
Which is pretty nice.

40
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:38,200
And you can set your compiler flags however you like so in this case I'm setting the warnings to all

41
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:42,090
and I'm setting my standard compile with a C plus plus 14.

42
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:44,770
I'll close that down as soon as you can see.

43
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:46,610
This is a pretty nice option here.

44
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,610
We can get a compiler error.

45
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:54,150
Let's say we forget that semi-colon and we run then the compiler error shows up down here.

46
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,060
It says in function main on line 7.

47
00:02:57,130 --> 00:03:02,920
Right here there is a semi-colon expected to actually get a little red little X there has you there's

48
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,110
right around here somewhere.

49
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:06,880
So you could fix your air and run it again.

50
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,280
And there you go there's your hello world.

51
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,950
So again these are some web based options.

52
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:13,090
They're not perfect.

53
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:18,940
You can't really save things and edit and do all kinds of good stuff but you can run a lot of the programs

54
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:22,340
that we're going to talk about in this class right in the C++ show on the web.
