1
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:10,510
In this video we'll take a look at the main elements of the code light idea or integrated development

2
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:15,670
environment now integrated development environments are really nice because they allow you to build

3
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:21,640
and compile and edit and debug and do everything from a common interface but they can be pretty complicated

4
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:22,450
as well.

5
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:27,290
Now the code like ID is a fairly simple idea as far as ideas go.

6
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:33,340
If you use Microsoft Visual Studio or if you use X code and Eclipse and others they're much more complicated

7
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:38,350
and they've got a lot more bells and whistles but code like is a great idea for C++ especially when

8
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:39,240
we're learning.

9
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,170
So let me go over some of the main elements here.

10
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,790
When you first start code like you have an interface that looks like this.

11
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:52,660
This is the main default interface or perspective as it's called in in code like over here on the left

12
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:57,660
you have the workspace pain which is this little rectangular area right here.

13
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:00,550
Here we this large area we've got our editing pane.

14
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:03,210
This is we're going to be editing and typing our source code.

15
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,780
Then we've got an output pane down at the bottom and you can see that each one of these has a lot of

16
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:11,600
little tabs in there and I'll break that up so you can see it a little better.

17
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:14,880
So here we've got a workspace tab and explorer tab and so forth.

18
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,450
And I'll go over what those do in just a moment.

19
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:20,220
Now at the moment there is no workspace at all.

20
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:25,000
So we need to create a workspace and then we need to add projects to that workspace.

21
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:29,320
So let's do that let's create a new workspace and we can do it right here.

22
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,120
We like you workspace right on the main menu here.

23
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:39,310
Or we could go up to workspace new workspace or we could get a file new new workspace you can choose

24
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:41,980
whichever one you like I'll choose this one right here.

25
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:43,850
I don't get the workspace name.

26
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:49,090
In this case I'm going to call it Section 4 because this is a video in Section 4 and that where we can

27
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:52,930
create our section for projects right within this workspace.

28
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:55,530
The path for the workspace you need to provide.

29
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:01,400
I'm going to select my CPE examples folder which is on my desktop.

30
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:06,870
Select that this will create that workspace within that folder and I'll select OK.

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,800
Now you can see that we've got a workspace here called Section 4 and a couple of other things have popped

32
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,800
up here you can see there's a de-bug down and book Atwal that is just a bit.

33
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:18,400
So at this point we need to create some projects.

34
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:21,180
Notice that there is nothing to edit here in those window.

35
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,470
It's empty because there are no C++ files ready for editing yet.

36
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:27,290
So let's create a project.

37
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:31,330
This is going to be very similar to the way we created the projects in the installation videos of the

38
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:32,480
previous sections.

39
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:35,390
Some would have right click on section for workspace.

40
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:41,370
I'm going to say new project at this point I'm going to select that default project template that we

41
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:48,200
created in this case I called it Frank default posts plus project summary select that press next.

42
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:51,310
And I want to get this project today and I'm just simply going to call it Project 1

43
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,050
select next 0.

44
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:00,700
Except these defaults which is my compiler debugger and also like to finish.

45
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,470
Now you can see I've got a project named Project 1 under my section for workspace.

46
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:08,110
And you can see there's the main CPV file.

47
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:13,650
If I double clicked that it will open up in the editor and it's just going to say hello world.

48
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,740
What gets a building and running this in the next video.

49
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:21,800
But for now let's create another project because remember we can have multiple projects in our workspace

50
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:25,930
someone to go back up to my workspace right click again.

51
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:35,670
New project I'll use the same template and I'll just call this project to and press next and finish.

52
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:41,190
So now you can see that we've got two projects within the work space also noticed that project one is

53
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:43,440
italicized and it's bold.

54
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:47,950
This tells you that this is the current project or the active project.

55
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:55,500
Now I can select the main C.P. and project 2 and you can see here we've got two C plus plus files one

56
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,520
for each project.

57
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:01,740
Now you'll notice that when I select these tabs you'll let us select this tab and this highlights right

58
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:02,420
here.

59
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:05,900
So this tells you that this is the main C-p for Project 1.

60
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,260
When I select this tab here on the right this means GPP lights up for project 2.

61
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:17,370
If you're not getting that behavior then this little link right here is probably not selected.

62
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:21,630
If that's unselective then you'll click on these and this won't change at all on the left side here

63
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:22,980
in the workspace for you.

64
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:27,390
So you want to make sure that that's selected that way at least the editor to the workspace files so

65
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,350
there you go.

66
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,510
We can switch between them very easily.

67
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:35,370
So let's change the source code I'm going to select this file right here and I'm just going to say hello

68
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:36,550
project one.

69
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:47,210
And I'm going to save it with control as your commands and I want to select this guy right here and

70
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:52,150
I'm going to say hello project to that we will be able to see the difference when we run them.

71
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:57,090
And I I'm saying that we could also do file save.

72
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,300
That's it.

73
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,330
Now suppose I want to change between projects.

74
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:02,190
So here.

75
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:04,540
Notice that project 1 is the active project.

76
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:09,350
You can select the active project just by choosing it here from the download list.

77
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:13,510
You can see when I when I hover over it as select the active project.

78
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:15,500
So that's as simple as that.

79
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:18,040
You can also double click on the project name.

80
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:24,060
So if I double click on project to project to is now the active project project one is now the active

81
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:27,100
project that was active project mean.

82
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:32,160
Well when I build a project let's say I come up to my build and I say build something run something

83
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,910
clean something and get to all this in the next video.

84
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:38,910
It's going to apply it to the currently active project.

85
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:43,830
It's real important because suppose that now you're here and you're modifying the source code here and

86
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:46,590
then you build and you see nothing's changed.

87
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:49,200
Well that's because this project too is not active.

88
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,360
Project 1 is the active project.

89
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:54,570
So when you build and run it's going to run project 1.

90
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:58,800
It may seem like this is pretty hard to keep track of but it's really not it's really easy to keep track

91
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,580
of what project is active and using this little link editor.

92
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:06,370
You can obviously see which file you're working on so it's pretty easy to do.

93
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:10,280
There's a couple of other things that I want to talk about here in the editor window here.

94
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:16,940
You can see that we've got line numbers selected and so the idea is displaying line numbers for us.

95
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:21,090
This is handy because the compiler errors will give you line numbers and will also throw you a little

96
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:21,800
error right here.

97
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:26,000
I'll show you some red a little mark that says hey the error is here which is kind of nice.

98
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:28,290
I'm going to keep the line numbers on for me.

99
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:30,590
You can choose to not use them if it distracts you.

100
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,750
But in the course I'll refer to a line number 7 line number 5.

101
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:38,100
That way it's much easier for you to follow along if you want to get rid of those line numbers.

102
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:44,160
You could just go up to settings preferences and read an editor you could say show line numbers in the

103
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,060
margin and you could just uncheck that.

104
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:47,730
It's a whole bunch of other options.

105
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:52,200
Yeah the thing you might notice is you'll notice right here to the left of the end there's a little

106
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,890
triangle that's called the code folding triangle.

107
00:06:55,890 --> 00:07:01,320
So if I select that you can see what happens is notice I've got active right now lines three four.

108
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,120
Well I've got all my lines right from 1 to 8 when I select that.

109
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:10,890
It hides lines 4 5 and 6 and you get this horizontal line showing you that yeah there is stuff in here.

110
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,230
I'm just hiding it right now.

111
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,340
This is called code folding.

112
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,290
It basically just hides that code.

113
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:22,830
This is real handy when you've got hundreds and hundreds of lines of code in your file and you're scrolling

114
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:24,000
through trying to find things.

115
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,290
It's really really nice to be able to just fold some stuff up.

116
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,610
In other words I'm working on this function right now.

117
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:32,670
I don't need to see all the other ones I just fold them out of the way.

118
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:36,010
We'll get to use these features later on as our programs get bigger.

119
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:40,290
But if you find yourself in the position where you've clicked on that by accident you see this line

120
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:43,370
and you're thinking well my goodness where did my source code go.

121
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:45,480
Don't worry the source code is still there.

122
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:50,820
Again if you see that horizontal line just click on that little triangle or show it for you also notice

123
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:56,040
that the editor uses color coding to display certain things.

124
00:07:56,040 --> 00:08:03,510
So for example you could see that INT and return are a purple color and you can also see that halo project

125
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:06,190
to here is in this dark blue color.

126
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:09,300
We've also got things in dark green light green and so forth.

127
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:12,580
Also notice that the integer 0 is red.

128
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:18,600
So there's rules that the idea is using behind the scenes to make it easier for you to figure out what's

129
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,710
going on.

130
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:25,330
So one of the rules that is saying hey you know what if you're seeing a reserve word or one of the keywords

131
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:28,170
in C++ make it purple.

132
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:35,510
You can tweak all of this by going to settings colors and fonts select C++ here on the left and you

133
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:40,460
can customize the font that you want to use for your keywords and so forth.

134
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:44,120
I recommend you just leave this alone unless you have a real problem with some of the colors that are

135
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:44,590
there.

136
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:46,480
OK.

137
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:49,460
So that makes it really easy to figure out what's going on.

138
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:52,840
So for example let's say I forgot this quote right here.

139
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:57,230
You could see that that entire thing is now dark blue that you something is not right.

140
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:00,370
So we can always use that coloring to help us out.

141
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:03,400
It's the idea trying to make life easier for you.

142
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:09,260
The output pane down at the bottom this is where our compiler messages will be displayed when we build

143
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:14,180
code it will tell us what we're building the status of the build and so forth.

144
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:20,180
It'll also be handy for doing global search and replaces both at the workspace level and at the project

145
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:20,840
level.

146
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:26,330
Sometimes we want to change a name from hello to hello there and it's really easy to do a global search

147
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:27,210
and replace.

148
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:29,400
There's a bunch of other tabs here.

149
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:31,940
These tabs we're not going to use most of them.

150
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,100
I'm basically just going to leave them alone.

151
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,130
But if they bother you you want to get rid of them.

152
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:40,670
You can click on these three horizontal dots right here these three vertical dots rather right here

153
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:43,150
and you could select to hide certain things.

154
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:49,100
So let's say we don't want to see the build queue tab just select build queue and it hides.

155
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,280
You can always bring it back if you like.

156
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:52,910
Like I said I'm just going to leave him alone.

157
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:58,940
But if your if your screen real estate is small or your monitor or small you're having trouble fitting

158
00:09:58,940 --> 00:09:59,960
all this stuff in.

159
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,720
This is a really easy way to do it.

160
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:08,240
We're going to use the most are build and output and obviously search and replace or can come in very

161
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:08,990
handy.

162
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:12,770
Ok now in the workspace view we've also got some tabs.

163
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:15,440
Now here I spread this you could see it a little bit.

164
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,550
The only ones we're really going to use here are workspace Explorer and tabs.

165
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:24,210
These last three tabbed groups see make help and W X craftier we're not really going to use them.

166
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,550
So what we can do is we can hide those.

167
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:34,850
So I get I'll select the three dots and hide W X craftier hide C make and hide tab groups.

168
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:35,810
That's it.

169
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:40,930
That makes it a little less cluttered and it's kind of nice too to see it all there.

170
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,790
This little drop down arrow here.

171
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:46,510
If I'm in tabs and I select download I can go to work space.

172
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:50,690
If you only have three tabs it's not really a big deal but if you've got a lot of tabs and it's really

173
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:56,420
nice to be able to do that especially when they're hidden and you can't see them in situations like

174
00:10:56,420 --> 00:11:03,780
this so the last thing I want to do is I want to show you that you can actually move these pains around.

175
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:08,360
Now this is the default perspective that you get out of the can.

176
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:10,810
Some people don't like the workspace view on the left.

177
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,070
They prefer it on the right.

178
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:17,710
So you could just grab the workspace view tab right here just move it over drag it to the right and

179
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,590
you'll see it light up.

180
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:24,670
You can see here if I wanted to put it down here it lights up the area that it's going to be in lights

181
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:26,700
up again at the top.

182
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,330
You could choose to put it wherever you like.

183
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:30,170
Let's say you like it over here on the right.

184
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,760
And some people like this workflow a little better.

185
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:38,860
So now you've got your workspace here on the right and your editor on the left you can do the same thing

186
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,470
with this output view.

187
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:44,700
I mean suppose I want to put my output view right under my workspace for you.

188
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:47,950
I could do that and I've got a really large editing area.

189
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:49,620
It's totally up to you.

190
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:54,030
The perspective that you use this is a real personal decision.

191
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:58,180
I've worked on teams where everybody on the team teams have hundreds everybody's got their own way of

192
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:58,950
doing things.

193
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:01,420
So everybody tweaks the environment their way.

194
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:08,140
The nice thing about this is that if you download some project and it's got this perspective saved you

195
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:12,440
can always come up to perspective and click on default laya.

196
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:14,280
That'll bring it right back to the default.

197
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:20,310
So I could just select that and here I am back to back to scratch just like you came out of the can.

198
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:26,290
If you prefer your layout to be a specific way let's say I like it like this and I want to move this

199
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:28,090
over just a little bit here.

200
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:33,950
And these guys appear like that again however you want to do it.

201
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:38,990
You can come up to perspective and then save current layout as.

202
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:42,640
So let's just say I want to call this Frank Dodd lay out

203
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:52,630
and I can save it so I can switch between the default layout and if I want to go back to my own laya

204
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,850
I can go back to Frank lay out really really easy to do.

205
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:59,590
There's two lay outs that come already pre-configured.

206
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:04,160
One is the default layout which is the one I've shown you before and the other one is a debug play out.

207
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,820
This is the layout that's used when you're doing debugging.

208
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:11,750
So if I select debug layout you can see that I've got an output view pane on the left and a debugger

209
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:16,580
pane on the right and code like will switch to this automatically when you go into debug mode.

210
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:23,400
Again if you have a better way of doing it that works for you you can tweak this and save that perspective.

211
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:34,940
So I switched back to the default perspective and we can also use the view options to hide or view different

212
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:35,300
page.

213
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:39,740
So for example if I don't want to see the output pane or the workspace pane I can certainly hide them

214
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:40,690
and view them.

215
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:46,340
I can also do that here by closing up with that little X right there to close up the workspace view.

216
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:49,980
I can also make the workspace really large by clicking this icon right here.

217
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,830
So you've got all these options you encourage you to play around with the environment and set it up

218
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:57,600
to a place where you feel comfortable working.

219
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:04,800
Recall we talked about this in one of the installation videos that we can show a toolbar so we can build

220
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:09,340
and run and save and have all kinds of options by just clicking on these toolbar icons.

221
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,530
I'm not going to use that since it really clutters things up for me and I want to be able to explain

222
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:14,850
exactly what I'm doing.

223
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:21,600
So for example that icon right there says run active project that one says start or continue debugger

224
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,490
so they can be confusing at first.

225
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:24,480
I'm not going to use those.

226
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,690
I'm simply going to come up here and tell you exactly what I'm doing.

227
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,830
So I'm going to close the toolbar down.

228
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:31,620
But again feel free to use it.

229
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:36,410
And that wraps up this quick tour of the code like ID.

230
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:41,940
We are certainly going to use more features as decors progresses in the next video we'll create our

231
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:47,700
first C++ program that goes a little bit beyond the hello world program and we'll use that program to

232
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:51,330
understand how the build process works within the code like I-T.
