00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:11,550
Hello welcome to the section 10 challenge in this challenge what I'm asking you to do is to create a

2
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:14,160
substitution cipher program.

3
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:20,310
This is really straightforward but it will give you some experience using the C++ string class.

4
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:24,060
Now there's an easy way to do this in an easy way to do this.

5
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:27,480
I'm not going to tell you what the easy way to do this is because I want you to learn and try to figure

6
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,030
it out on your own.

7
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,600
Let me talk about the challenge.

8
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:35,630
A simple very old method of sending messages is the substitution cypher.

9
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:40,470
I remember using this as a kid with some of my friends we used to have something called a secret decoder

10
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:41,030
ring.

11
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:47,070
And the idea is you have a message and then you look at every character in that message and you replace

12
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:49,020
it with the character on the ring.

13
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:54,030
So for example every time you see a lowercase A gets replaced with a capital X or the time you see a

14
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:57,380
lower case b gets replaced with a capital Z and so forth.

15
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:01,170
So it's called the substitution cypher it's really a straightforward cipher.

16
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:04,370
It's not a very secure cipher at all but it's a fun cipher to do.

17
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:09,570
So here's the idea I want you to write a program that asks the user to enter a secret message that will

18
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:14,340
be a string and then I want you to encrypt that message using the substitution cypher and display the

19
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,750
encrypted message.

20
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:20,040
Then take that encrypted message and decrypt it back to the original message.

21
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:20,620
OK.

22
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,520
You can use two strings for your substitution.

23
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,390
You can have one string for the alphabet.

24
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:27,780
And let me write this here for you.

25
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,780
That way you maybe understand a little bit better.

26
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:36,880
So let's say you have one string which is the alphabet and this string contains all the characters that

27
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:37,990
you want to substitute.

28
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:45,080
So for example let's say we've got a B C and so forth and capital a capital B capital C..

29
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:51,390
Ok then I've got another string called the key and you can name these Anything you like.

30
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:57,790
And the idea here is that for every character up in the alphabet string you're going to have a character

31
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:59,780
in the key strain that will substitute it.

32
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:07,960
So if I want to substitute that lowercase a for an X it'll be here and let's say that the B gets Z and

33
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:19,040
C gets a Q And then this upper case a gets a lowercase let's say z a lowercase Q and A lowercase D.

34
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:21,400
Does it really matter what you replace them with.

35
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:24,690
So now the idea is really straightforward.

36
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:33,300
Whenever you see the secret message this is the secret message is a b c you look in the alphabet you'll

37
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:34,750
look for that little AA.

38
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:37,700
You find it you find it in position 0.

39
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:44,100
Then you go to the key the position 0 and whatever is there you replace it you do the same thing with

40
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,280
lowercase b.

41
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:51,060
It's going to be replaced with a Z and you do the same thing with the lowercase c to replace it with

42
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:57,130
a Q Obviously you just keep going down the string whatever you find to replace.

43
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:58,910
So that would be my original message.

44
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:00,710
This is now my encrypted message.

45
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,350
How would I decrypt the message.

46
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:04,320
Do the same thing just the other way around.

47
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:06,430
You look in the key for an x.

48
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:12,340
I find it at position zero so I go to position C Roman alphabet and I grab that little AA.

49
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:18,290
Again I look for the Z it's in position 1 there's my be in position one and then my key is going to

50
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:24,450
be in position three or sorry position to and gives me my c.

51
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:25,600
So there you go.

52
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:29,640
Really really straightforward to do make the cipher stronger if you wish.

53
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,780
This is a really weak cipher.

54
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,010
Right now it's on the substituting the letters.

55
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:38,640
And let me scroll down here just a little bit to show you when I'm giving you to start with.

56
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:42,710
You can see what I'm giving you to start with I'm giving you an alphabet which is a string of all the

57
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:44,910
lower case and upper case letters.

58
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:47,700
I kept these in order just to make it easier to debug.

59
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:48,980
And then you've got the key.

60
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,160
Those are the substitution.

61
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:54,810
So for every one of these letters there is an equivalent letter here that we're going to substitute.

62
00:03:54,950 --> 00:04:01,070
So for example whenever we see a lowercase a in our message we're going to substitute it with a capital

63
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,220
X..

64
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:09,440
Whenever I see a capital Z I'm going to substitute it with a lowercase r that's for encryption and then

65
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:13,180
for decryption you just read the encrypted string and you go the other way around.

66
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:20,200
So if you see a capital x in your encrypted string you replace it with a lowercase a to decrypt it.

67
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,520
That's it really straightforward.

68
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:24,920
As I said I'm only using letters here.

69
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:29,360
I'm not dealing with numbers or spaces you can be as creative as you want with that.

70
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:33,530
There's a lot of ways to make this a lot stronger and just have fun doing it.

71
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:36,700
Remember I'm writing this right here on line 28.

72
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:42,230
Remember the less code you write the less code you have to test reuse existing functionality in the

73
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:43,210
libraries.

74
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:45,560
Use the code that's in the string class.

75
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,080
Don't try to create all this on your own.

76
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,550
Remember the kiss principle.

77
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:56,540
Keep this as simple as you can reuse as much as you can and that makes your program very likely a lot

78
00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:00,320
more correct than it will be if you try to do everything on your own.

79
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:05,780
Remember those those library functions and methods that we've used they've been tested and they've been

80
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:12,350
debugged for years and years so they're pretty solid so reused us so that may give you a sample run

81
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:14,530
so that you can see what to expect.

82
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:17,450
So I'm going to run this and you can see here.

83
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:24,500
Enter your secret message and I'll say I'll meet you at Lili's house

84
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:32,220
at 10am.

85
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:33,950
Now Precentor.

86
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,670
And it says encrypting message.

87
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,600
And here's the encrypted message you can see it's replacing characters.

88
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,900
It's pretty obvious what's going on here right.

89
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:47,270
You can see the Capitol in isle is being replaced with a lowercase J.

90
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:53,720
The apostrophe is not being replaced at all because I'm only dealing with letters the L lowercase L

91
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,990
is being replaced with the D a capital D.

92
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:58,490
You can see here you can see it going across it.

93
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:00,520
That's your encrypted message then.

94
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:04,100
I'm taking that encrypted message and decrypting it just doing the opposite.

95
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:07,530
I just did and I got back the same message I started with.

96
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:10,400
OK so you can see it's pretty easy.

97
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,340
So my secret message will be this is

98
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:19,690
my secret message.

99
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,450
There's the encrypted message.

100
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:27,620
OK you can see the third character here is an AI which is being replaced by a capital J and you can

101
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:31,650
see the eye again right here and the is and there's the Capitol J again.

102
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:34,980
OK so have fun.

103
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,640
Like I said and make us stronger.

104
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:42,180
That's what I like to do learn and play around with ideas that you may have to make the stronger it's

105
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,300
a lot of fun to try.

106
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:48,150
OK so when you're done I'll see you over in this solution and I'll show you my solution.
