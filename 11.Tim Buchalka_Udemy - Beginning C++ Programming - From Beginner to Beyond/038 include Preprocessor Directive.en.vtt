00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:11.720
It this video will briefly go over the C++ preprocessor and preprocessor directives.

2
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:17.250
What does the C plus plus preprocess the C plus plus preprocess or is a program.

3
00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.610
That process is your source code before the compiler sees it.

4
00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:28.110
The C++ preprocess are first strip's all the comments from the source file and replaces each comment

5
00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:33.640
with a single space that it looks for preprocessor directives and executes them.

6
00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:40.200
Preprocessor directives or lines in the source code that begin with a pound or hash tag simple as you

7
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.560
can see in this slide there are quite a few preprocessor directives available.

8
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.310
The most commonly used preprocessor directive is the include directive when the preprocessor sees this

9
00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:51.080
directive.

10
00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:57.030
It replaces the power to include line with the file that it's referring to that it recursively processes

11
00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.680
that file as well.

12
00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.740
So by the time the compiler sees the source code all comments are stripped out and all preprocessor

13
00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:11.100
directives have been processed and removed preprocessor directives are commonly used to conditionally

14
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.360
compile code.

15
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.060
For example suppose you only want to compile a portion of your source code.

16
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.540
If you're on the Windows operating system in this case you would use a preprocessor directive to test

17
00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.180
to see if you are on Windows and that perhaps includes some Windows specific libraries.

18
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.170
If you're not on Windows then maybe you want to include some Macalester 10 libraries or use the air

19
00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:37.710
directive to abort the compile with an error message conditional compilation is beyond the scope of

20
00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.760
this course but will use several preprocessor directives as we move on in the course.

21
00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:49.860
One final note it's very important to understand the C++ preprocessor does not understand C++.

22
00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:51.210
Let me say that again.

23
00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.040
The C++ preprocessor does not understand C++.

24
00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.890
It simply follows the preprocessor directives and gets the source code ready for the compiler.

25
00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.630
The compiler is the program that does understand C++.

26
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.590
OK that wraps up this video.

27
00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.720
And the next video will talk about comments and C++.
