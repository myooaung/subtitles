00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:12.440
In this video we'll talk about the functions that we can use with characters the CC type library includes

2
00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:18.620
very simple and very useful functions that allow the Tessy of characters for various properties as well

3
00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:25.250
as the conversion of characters from upper to lower or lower to upper case in order to use these functions

4
00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:33.360
you must include CC type the functions all expect a single character in the case of the testing functions

5
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.720
that evaluate to true or false.

6
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.740
And the conversion functions return the converted character.

7
00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.130
Let's see some of these functions

8
00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.930
this table contains some of the functions and CC type that allow for testing of characters.

9
00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:56.030
You call the function and pass in the character you wish to test in the parentheses.

10
00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.730
The function then evaluates to true or false depending on whether the character has the property you're

11
00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:02.250
testing or not.

12
00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:09.170
Is alpha test to see if the character has a letter either uppercase or lowercase and evaluates to true

13
00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.580
if it is or false otherwise is Al numb.

14
00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:18.830
Test to see if the character is a letter or a digit is digit test to see if the character is a digit

15
00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:27.060
is lower test to see if the character is a lowercase letter is print test to see if the character is

16
00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.810
a printable character.

17
00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:35.960
Is Punkt test to see if the characters are a punctuation character is up or test to see if the characters

18
00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:43.350
an upper case letter and is space test to see if the character is a whitespace character.

19
00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:47.180
There are a few other functions in CC type that I haven't listed in a table.

20
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.930
You can refer to the C plus docs for those.

21
00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:52.670
Now let's see the conversion functions

22
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.700
the two character conversion functions are two lower and two upper two lower evaluates the lower case

23
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.730
equivalent of the character passed in and two upper The upper case equivalent.

24
00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:14.090
If these functions can't perform the conversion then the function simply valuate to the character that

25
00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.730
was passed in as you can see these functions are very handy.

26
00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.490
They're also extremely efficient will use these functions in the next few videos.

27
00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.890
When we talk more about strings in the next video we'll learn about C-style strings.

28
00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:29.820
I'll see you there.
