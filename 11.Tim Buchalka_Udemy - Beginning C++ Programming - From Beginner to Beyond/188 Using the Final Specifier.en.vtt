00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:13.000
In this video we'll learn about the C plus plus 11 final specifier we can use the final specifier in

2
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:21.340
two contexts at the class level the final specifier prevents a class from being derived from or subclassed.

3
00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.840
Sometimes frameworks have final classes it can't be subclassed.

4
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.700
In some cases this is done for better compiler optimization.

5
00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:34.690
Other times it may be done to ensure that objects are copied safely without slicing when used that the

6
00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.460
method or function level the final specifier prevents the method from being overridden.

7
00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:46.980
In derived classes this can also be done for better compiler optimization.

8
00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:51.220
The syntax for using the final specifier at the class level is pretty simple.

9
00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:57.520
We simply add the final specifier after the class name when we declare it in the first example my class

10
00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.190
cannot be derived from.

11
00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.330
And in the second example derived cannot be derived from.

12
00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:10.120
If you try to drive a class from these classes the compiler will generate a compiler error.

13
00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:14.470
Now let's see the final specifier in the context of a virtual function.

14
00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:19.560
In this case we have a simple class hierarchy with three classes A B and C.

15
00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.760
The base class A declares the function do something is virtual.

16
00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.330
Class B is derived from AA and it overrides do something.

17
00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.740
But it also marks it as final.

18
00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.470
So do something can no longer be overridden.

19
00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.720
Further down in the hierarchy.

20
00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.420
Notice that if Class C tries to override do something the compiler generates an error.
