00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:10.920
This video will go over the steps necessary to create our own custom project template.

2
00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:15.610
The idea here is that we can create our own project templates and when we create our projects we can

3
00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:18.070
use this template as the starting point.

4
00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:23.420
That way we'll have a proper main that CBP file will have all our switches set.

5
00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:24.990
We'll have our environments set.

6
00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:25.390
All right.

7
00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:26.170
So let's get started.

8
00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.840
First thing I need to do is open up a workspace I've got a workspace already open.

9
00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.570
I've already created I should say I'm going to open it now I'm going to say open workspace.

10
00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.610
If you don't have a workspace at all you could just say file new workspace.

11
00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:46.660
So open the workspace that I've got it's on my desktop and it's called C-p workspace so open that and

12
00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.590
the first thing you want to do is you want to add a project she want to right click on your workspace

13
00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:55.290
in say New new project.

14
00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:00.820
Now here you've got the new project wizard and you've got different examples you can create GUI applications

15
00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.100
console applications you can have user templates and so forth.

16
00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:11.290
What we want to do is we want to use the simple executive Bill G plus plus template that comes with

17
00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:12.560
code like.

18
00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:16.540
And we want to tweak that our own way into what we want to do is to create our own template and here

19
00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:17.620
that we can choose.

20
00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.820
And we could put it in Consolo we can put it here and use for templates we could put it wherever we

21
00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:22.870
like.

22
00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.870
But before we do that we need to create a project so let's do that.

23
00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:32.350
I'm going to sit a console and let's use the G plus plus simple executive Konsole template a press next

24
00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.940
the project name it does it really matter.

25
00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:43.510
I'll just say sample since we're going to save it as a template anyway and I'll select next we want

26
00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:45.690
to make sure our compilers is set up correctly.

27
00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.450
Here I'm using Mingy W and the gdb debugger.

28
00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:56.970
So like finish and that creates our project.

29
00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:58.300
You can see here's the source file.

30
00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.720
Here's the file which is really C-code and that's C++ code.

31
00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:03.430
But we'll fix all this in a minute.

32
00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:10.080
So first thing we want to do is we want to get rid of this and let's write simple C++ program to simple

33
00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:17.060
when we've been writing all along so we'll say include IO stream we'll include IO stream since we could

34
00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.370
probably use it in most of the projects that we write.

35
00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:29.100
Then we have our main function and again its int main open close friends and then an open Kerley which

36
00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:35.700
will be automatically closed by code like here we can indented by just pressing tab and we could say

37
00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:45.280
SDD to Kolins C out and then the insertion operator followed by the string Hello world.

38
00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.220
And you can type anything you like here for Hello world.

39
00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.260
And we'll do also as tiddy to Coleen's and Del.

40
00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:58.980
This prince a new line that way when we display hello world the cursor will go to the next line on the

41
00:02:58.980 --> 00:02:59.920
console.

42
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.340
And then finally we'll just return 0 like we always do.

43
00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:03.270
That's it.

44
00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:09.410
I'm going to save this so that press control us here so I've just done that and saved it.

45
00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.610
Now we'll set some compiler settings that will do this the one time that will save it as a project template.

46
00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.530
So let's go to the sample project.

47
00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:24.900
The actual project name and we're right click go down to settings global settings and we want to make

48
00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.240
sure we've got these two compiler options set so we get to right click on those three little dots here

49
00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:34.530
on the button you want to select that button and click and we want to make sure that we've got are all

50
00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:40.210
warnings enabled on and our C++ 14 standard on press.

51
00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:42.230
OK.

52
00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:49.300
Then you want to come towards his code completion and select that and select enable C++ 14 standard

53
00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:50.040
apply.

54
00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:52.940
And that's it.

55
00:03:52.940 --> 00:04:01.130
Now what we can do is we can come to the project again right click and say save as template so select

56
00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.670
that and what's the project name.

57
00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:11.600
This could be anything we want we could just say Frank template or template for course or any name you

58
00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:12.870
like.

59
00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.660
Rather than that I'm just going to say Frank.

60
00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.320
Let's see.

61
00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.510
Plus plus console

62
00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:31.420
template I think it's pretty picky about spaces in cities those dashes and it is a console application

63
00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.260
that if you leave it as console it'll be in the console group.

64
00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:43.530
I'm actually going to change that to user template and then you can give it a description you want I'll

65
00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.210
just say Frank's console template

66
00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.030
it says like OK.

67
00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.570
And now we've got a new template that's stored.

68
00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:58.410
So if I go back to my workspace and I want to create a new project now we close all this up I'm going

69
00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:05.640
to right click and say new project and now you can go onto your templates and go down to user templates

70
00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:11.080
right here and you should see that one we just created right here.

71
00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:19.720
So we just select that next I'll just say Project 1 select next.

72
00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:24.040
Keep the defaults for the compilers and finish at this point.

73
00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:31.030
You can double click here to make that project the active project and we'll look at the main CGP you

74
00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:34.420
could see it's the main see that we just typed.

75
00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:39.790
Also if you right click on the project and you go out to the settings you can see code completion is

76
00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:44.900
C++ 14 and the global settings have the appropriate compiler flags that we need.

77
00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:52.880
That's it will test this real quick that's run build and execute.

78
00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:54.480
And hello world.

79
00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:54.810
That's it.

80
00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:59.380
So now you've got a project draw set up you can create as many of these as you like tweak the settings

81
00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:00.660
as far as you like.

82
00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:05.710
It's really up to you to decide what you want to do with the project templates but for this course include

83
00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:06.710
IO stream.

84
00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:10.630
Give yourself a man you may or may not want this line right here since you know you've probably got

85
00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:11.460
to get rid of it anyway.

86
00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:17.740
When we start writing other code but at a minimum do something like that when you create a new project

87
00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.190
you'll be ready to start coding.
