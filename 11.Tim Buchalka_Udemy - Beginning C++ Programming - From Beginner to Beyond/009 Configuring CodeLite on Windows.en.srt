1
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:11,630
In this video we're going to configure the code light idea that we just installed to work on our windows

2
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:13,630
system with C++.

3
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,960
So the first thing we want to do is we want to start code like.

4
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:21,800
So I'm just going to double click on the icon and the first time that you run code like you'll probably

5
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:26,540
get a little setup wizard pop up and here it is.

6
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:30,890
You may also get a window that says you want to update to the latest version which you can certainly

7
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:31,340
do.

8
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:33,490
I'm going to cancel for this video.

9
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:35,010
And here's the setup wizard.

10
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:37,930
Now it's important that you run through this setup wizard.

11
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:43,550
If this does not show up for the first time you can always find it appear you can still like help and

12
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:46,080
then you can run the setup wizard here.

13
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,830
But in this case it does show up.

14
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:50,630
So I'm going to go through this and only have to do this one time.

15
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:53,120
I'm going to select next.

16
00:00:54,200 --> 00:01:01,160
Now here the way that code works is it uses a lot of plugins to support ph C C plus plus and so forth.

17
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:03,700
We only care about C++ in this case.

18
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:09,380
So what we want to do is we want to clear these plugins so you can see all the checkmarks are gone and

19
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:17,970
then we want to toggle the C++ plugins only someone to select that until only the C++ ones show up.

20
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:19,740
OK so that's what we need to do.

21
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:24,260
Just make sure that not all of them are set up just some of them you can use that toggle to do it or

22
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:26,630
select next.

23
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:28,160
Now we want to set up the compiler.

24
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:33,740
Now remember if you've already installed the Mingy w compiler then you could just click scan if you

25
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:35,710
haven't go back to the video and install it.

26
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:41,020
I wouldn't install it from this option because it installs an older version of the GW compiler.

27
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:44,000
So I'm going to scan and it should find it.

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,680
There it is.

29
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:49,430
So I want to select it and press next.

30
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:52,000
Now here you can customize the colors to whatever you like.

31
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:57,800
This dark moniker chi theme is kind of nice on the vision it's not so hard in your eyes but for the

32
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,250
video.

33
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:03,260
I'm going to use the classic eclipse look that way I think it shows up a little better on video so I

34
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:10,250
select next will leave these defaults as is and will press finish.

35
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:13,730
OK now at this point you want to save and exit.

36
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,970
It's going to ask you this every time you make a change and it gets pretty annoying.

37
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:21,860
So I'm just going to say remember my answer and don't ask me again and every time I make a change I

38
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:25,430
want to save and exit soft save and exit.

39
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:32,300
OK so it saves it and it opens it up again and now the settings that I set were applied.

40
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,310
And again I'll cancel the new download here.

41
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:38,140
So let me make this full screen here.

42
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:43,660
And as I mentioned before if that setup wizard does not show up you can started here.

43
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:45,690
Run the setup wizard.

44
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:53,000
OK so now what we want to do is we want to create a new workspace and once we create the new workspace

45
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,420
We'll run.

46
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:56,550
I have a couple of settings to do and then once that's done it will be all set.

47
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:58,230
So let's create a new workspace.

48
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,490
A workspace is basically an area where you can have different C++ projects in.

49
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,920
So the first thing we want to do is create a new workspace I'll select that.

50
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:10,480
You can also say file new workspace.

51
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,500
OK so I'll do it right here and it's going to ask me for the name of the workspace so I'll just say

52
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,810
see workspace.

53
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:25,730
You can do this whatever you like if you want to have a workspace rather the section one exercises section

54
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:29,050
2 Section 3 or whatever you like whatever makes sense for you.

55
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:34,790
I'm going to put it in my documents folder and I want to create the workspace under a separate directory.

56
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:37,400
That just helps me organize my files.

57
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,030
I'll select OK.

58
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:45,410
Good now you can see here on the left pane of my workspace view I've got a workspace now the workspace

59
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,210
in and of itself.

60
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,300
Is it real useful.

61
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:54,490
I need to create a project within the workspace so I can right click on workspace and say new project.

62
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:57,510
So I'll do that and select new project.

63
00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:01,030
At this point we've got some options.

64
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:08,870
We're going to select the console option and then simple execrable G plus plus that's basically the

65
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:10,710
C++ compiler.

66
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,460
It's called C++ because it's from a canoe.

67
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:16,120
So I'll select that next.

68
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,080
And then you give your project a name.

69
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,040
This could be again any name you like.

70
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:21,980
Avoid spaces just to be safe.

71
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:26,870
Just simple name so I'll say test one let's say.

72
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:31,790
And again I want to create a project under in a separate directory or press.

73
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:38,330
Next here you can choose the compiler has probably already chosen it for you if you've got multiple

74
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:39,100
compilers.

75
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:45,710
You can set individual compilers on a per project level but we're using the GW compiler and we're using

76
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:47,350
the good debugger.

77
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:51,170
The build system will be default and select to finish.

78
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,570
So it's gone off and created a new project you could see it here on the left side it's called Test 1.

79
00:04:56,570 --> 00:05:01,560
And as I explode these you can see that there's my main file.

80
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:08,780
That's the program that it's created for me by fault the dots BPP extension means that it's a C++ file.

81
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,560
I'm going to double click on that and you can see my fondest.

82
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,330
Pretty small here because I just installed this let me increase my font.

83
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:20,150
You may not have to do this on your end but it's going to show up better on video if I do it.

84
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:24,960
Someone to go to settings colors and fonts and not just set it to 16.

85
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:30,600
It should be nice ply can go that way it's much easier for you to see.

86
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:33,770
Now what we want to do is we want to delete all this.

87
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,410
This is actually C-code not C++ code.

88
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:40,570
So let's delete all of that and let's write a real simple test from scratch.

89
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:47,430
So the first thing we'll do is we'll include IO stream.

90
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,660
This allows us to do input and output.

91
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:54,060
And we'll talk much more about what these include directives mean in a future video.

92
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:58,230
In this example just type along and make sure that the environment is working.

93
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:03,020
So you want to say pound include and IO stream in angle brackets.

94
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:05,590
Then we want to say int space main.

95
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:15,200
This is our main function to Prendes and we'll create a couple of Curley's curly braces then in here

96
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:18,570
we're going to say is s t d colon colon.

97
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:27,380
Seek out the insertion operator which is two less than signs followed by a low testing or anything you

98
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:27,710
like.

99
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:31,660
And then a semi-colon at the end and then finally return 0.

100
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,350
That's it.

101
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,030
That's a simple test.

102
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:39,590
Again will be a separate video where I go over the anatomy of a C++ program and we'll go over all this

103
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:40,570
in detail.

104
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:43,200
So in this case again we're including IO stream.

105
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:49,100
We've got our main function and we're printing hello testing to the screen where we're turning zero

106
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,800
which means programs successful.

107
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:57,680
I'm going to save this and I'm not going to do this on the videos but you can certainly do this at home

108
00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:02,160
if you come up to view and you can toggle the minimal view.

109
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:08,480
When you do that you'll get some icons up here you can use these icons to build and say for example

110
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,040
that's a safe right there.

111
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:14,450
I'm not going to do that because I don't want as much screen real estate as possible on the videos so

112
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:17,580
I'll just toggle that off.

113
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:18,400
OK.

114
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:20,680
So I'm going to file say.

115
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:27,590
And at this point we're ready to run the program but we need to make a couple of changes just because

116
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:30,340
we want to use modern C++.

117
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:36,650
So what we can do is we can click on the project test one in this example and all right click and then

118
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:38,550
at the bottom you'll see settings.

119
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:44,750
So select settings and you can see right down here at the bottom where global settings.

120
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:51,620
I want to select that and where it says C++ compiler options.

121
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:56,060
You can click right in there and then you'll see these three little dots here and the buttons are useless

122
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,850
and other menus you can select that.

123
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:00,890
And we want to make sure that a couple of things are set.

124
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:05,530
We want to be sure that C plus plus 14 is checked.

125
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:11,140
That means we're using the latest version of the standard which is modern C++.

126
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:16,720
We also want to be sure that the w h l l all warnings is checked.

127
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,240
OK.

128
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:19,280
So that's it for now.

129
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:19,990
That will be fine.

130
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:20,960
We will select OK

131
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:27,710
and we'll apply and.

132
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,790
Okay perfect.

133
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:35,930
Now I also want to click on the workspace itself and right click on that and come down to workspace

134
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:38,330
settings and select that.

135
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:46,130
And when you come to code completion you want to be sure that C++ 14 standard is enabled code completion

136
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:51,220
is something that the ID does as you type is trying to figure out what you want to do and help you out

137
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:53,090
so you don't have to do a lot of typing.

138
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:58,550
And in this case we want to tell it to use the foreignness C++ 14 standard so when it's trying to figure

139
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:59,260
things out.

140
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:00,940
So I select OK.

141
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:04,490
Now at this point we should be ready to try this out.

142
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:09,200
Someone expand this little window down here at the bottom and I'm going to come up to it says build

143
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:18,290
and then we'll select clean project then we'll go back to build and just say run at this point it's

144
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:19,410
going to say what do you want to do.

145
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:22,110
Do you just want to run it or you want to build it and run it.

146
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,870
In this case I want to build it and run and not talk more about the workflow that's used for cleaning

147
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:30,920
and compiling and so forth a little bit later on in the course.

148
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:35,570
So in this case I want to say build and execute and it will compile and run the program.

149
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:39,690
If there are no errors it'll run and you'll get a window pop up with the output.

150
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:41,050
Hello testing in there.

151
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:43,520
If there are errors let me show you what they might look like.

152
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,790
Just in case you do see them.

153
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:53,930
Suppose I forget that semi-colon at the end there and I'm going to say build run build and execute and

154
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:57,270
you can see this red down here that says error.

155
00:09:57,290 --> 00:10:00,090
I expected a semi-colon before the return.

156
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:07,150
You also get a read error here and it says again semi-colon expected So basically you just put the semi-colon

157
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:13,420
in there save it and then go back up to build and run build and execute.

158
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:18,070
You can click on here for it to remember to always build and execute or just execute again.

159
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:18,910
Don't do that yet.

160
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:22,880
We'll do that as the course progresses and I'll show you the different workflows we can use.

161
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:24,970
Build and execute.

162
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:25,910
There we go.

163
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:33,340
Now if at this point you get a error that says that some DLF can't be found then what you want to do

164
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:39,510
is you want to go back to the project right click and go down to settings.

165
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:46,030
And remember you only have to do this if you get some kind of runtime error that says some C-p PDL file

166
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:51,190
was not found and go to global settings and then would you want to do is you want to go to the linker

167
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:58,390
options and just select write on there and click that little button and down here at the bottom what

168
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:07,660
you want to do is you just want to add a couple of lines you can say Dasch static dash lib GCC and then

169
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:12,250
press center and that Dasch static dash lib.

170
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:13,530
S t d.

171
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:15,530
C plus plus.

172
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:21,340
OK so what will happen here is now the linker is going to statically link the files and not have to

173
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:24,640
use dynamically linked libraries or DL else.

174
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,450
Again you only have to do this if you if you get that error if you don't get the error you can do it

175
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:37,170
also and it's not going to hurt but still like to OK apply and let's do a build rebuild.

176
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:38,220
Let's do a clean first.

177
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:42,790
Whenever you change any kind of settings you want to clean the project which really just cleans everything

178
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:44,350
up and gives you a starting place.

179
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:48,790
So will clean the project and then we'll just say run build and execute.

180
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:53,910
In this case it's going to statically link it which is just as good and hello testing.

181
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:55,690
We're all set at this point.

182
00:11:55,690 --> 00:12:01,510
We've got a grid install it's configured and we're ready to use code like to start learning C++.
