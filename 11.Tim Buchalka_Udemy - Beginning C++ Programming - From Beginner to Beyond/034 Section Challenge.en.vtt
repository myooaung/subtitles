00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.180
Welcome back.

2
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.300
So you're ready for the second challenge.

3
00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:10.450
Go over the challenge.

4
00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.620
Create a C++ program that asks the user for their favorite number between 1 and 100.

5
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.020
Then read this number from the console.

6
00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.730
Suppose the user enters number 24 you want to display the following to the console.

7
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:24.480
Amazing.

8
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.040
That's my favorite number too.

9
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.820
That's exactly what we did in our first program.

10
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.780
Now here's the little bit of a twist.

11
00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:31.890
You also want to display.

12
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:32.570
No really.

13
00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.560
24 is my favorite number.

14
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.410
Below are two sample runs of the program.

15
00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.820
So in this case we're prompting the user.

16
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:40.910
There is our prompt.

17
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.140
The user enters 24 and we prayed that amazing That's my favorite number two.

18
00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:46.890
No really.

19
00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.760
24 is my favorite number.

20
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.100
If I run this program again and I type in 75 I'll get 75.

21
00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.000
So let me run the program for you to see what it looks like.

22
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.270
Here we go.

23
00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.850
This is the prompt to the user at your your favorite number between 1 and 100.

24
00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.410
So to say it's hepped and a 50 and press center then you're going to display to the user.

25
00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:11.700
Amazing That's my favorite number two.

26
00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:12.290
No really.

27
00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.380
50 is my favorite number.

28
00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.930
That's it.

29
00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:16.620
That's the challenge.

30
00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:17.110
That's it.

31
00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.930
That's the challenge.

32
00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.530
Give it a shot and then come back to the next video and we'll work through the solution together.
