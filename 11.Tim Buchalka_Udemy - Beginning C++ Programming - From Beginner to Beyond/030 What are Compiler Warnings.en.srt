00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:10,030
In this video we'll talk about compiler warnings and why they happen.

2
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:12,820
Big tip don't ignore compiler warnings.

3
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:15,130
We'll talk more about that in a minute.

4
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:19,300
The compiler has noticed a potential problem in your code and it's warning you about it.

5
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:21,480
That's what compiler warnings are all about.

6
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:27,010
It's only a warning because the compiler is still able to understand your code and produce object code

7
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:27,850
from it.

8
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:32,180
However it's that you know to be aware that something could be problematic.

9
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:38,440
In this example we've declared a variable called miles driven and it's an integer it can hold any kind

10
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,530
of whole number.

11
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:44,630
Then on the next line we display the value of miles driven to the con..

12
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:50,560
The compiler produces a warning here it's warning us that you've used the variable miles driven but

13
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,050
you never initialized it.

14
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:55,730
So in other words the value that it contains could be anything.

15
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:58,400
Once again don't ignore compiler warnings.

16
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:03,040
Many programmers treat them as errors and fix the potential issues up front.

17
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:06,910
Let's head over to code light and we'll see some of these warnings.

18
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:12,520
So now I'm back in code like I've created a project called compiler warnings and again it's a default

19
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,630
project just simple Hello World.

20
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:19,210
Now what I'd like to do is let's use that favorite number variable again so let's create that here.

21
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:23,890
I'm going to say int space and the name of my variable let's call it.

22
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:25,150
Favorite number.

23
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,190
Perfect.

24
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,820
Now suppose I want to print out that favorite number.

25
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:37,390
So I'm going to remove this hello world right here and I'm just going to replace it with favorite number

26
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,010
so that's all I want to do.

27
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:45,560
I've got a favorite number I'm going to print it out now if I try to compile this syntactically there's

28
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:49,660
nothing wrong with this program but there is a problem with the compiler warning you right here.

29
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:54,500
It's saying favorite number is used uninitialized in this function.

30
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:59,400
So in other words you haven't told the compiler what the value of favorite number is.

31
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:05,660
You have asked the user to put anything into favorite number and you're going to print the compiler

32
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:10,700
telling you be careful because anything could print here and in this case anything will print here so

33
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,820
let's run this you can see what it looks like.

34
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:19,680
I'm going to run build and execute and look at what favorite number is for 0 0 9 7 1.

35
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,560
Probably not what you expected.

36
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:22,910
That's the reason for the warning.

37
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:27,560
The compiler is telling you you never set that variable to any specific value.

38
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,950
So when I.

39
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,730
Who knows what is going to be in there.

40
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,900
OK we'll talk more about that when we talk about variables.

41
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:39,050
So that's one of the issues that you could have another issue you can have is that me go back to hello

42
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,470
world here.

43
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:44,200
Another issue you can have is suppose that in this case.

44
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,160
Now we do assign something to that favorite number.

45
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:53,360
This is a favorite number is I don't know a hundred.

46
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,720
So look what we've done now.

47
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,100
We've created a variable.

48
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,930
We've assigned a value to the variable.

49
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,170
We haven't used it.

50
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:03,090
So the computer's thinking wait a minute did you plan to use that variable.

51
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:05,290
Why did you create a variable and not use it at all.

52
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:12,480
So will compile and the warning is variable favorite number set but not used.

53
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:15,530
OK so it's telling you are you sure you want this.

54
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:18,900
There's no reason for you to create a value and then not use it.

55
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:28,350
And similarly if I get rid of favorite number here and I just do something like that and compile There's

56
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:32,420
the warning again unused variable you've created a variable which you haven't even used it.

57
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:34,560
So what do you want.

58
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,390
The idea is you should have a no warnings policy in your code.

59
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:42,180
You should have a clean compiler with no warnings.

60
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:46,830
Now there's many many more warnings and will run into them when we talk about if statements and looping

61
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,740
and assigning and doing math and we'll talk more about those mornings when we get there.
