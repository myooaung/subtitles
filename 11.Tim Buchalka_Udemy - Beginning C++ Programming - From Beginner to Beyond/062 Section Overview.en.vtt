00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:11.040
In this section we'll learn about expression's statements and operators in C++.

2
00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.730
Expressions are the building blocks of statements and statements are the building blocks of programming

3
00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:18.010
and C plus.

4
00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:21.890
You've already seen variable declaration statements and IO statements.

5
00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.490
Simple assignments statements and even the return statement.

6
00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.200
First we'll talk about expressions and statements in general and their role in programming.

7
00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:33.020
Learn about block statements or compound statements.

8
00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:38.460
This allows us to group multiple statements that belong together into a single unit.

9
00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:45.590
The last part of this section is all about the main C++ operators in the context of statements and expressions.

10
00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:51.330
We'll first discuss the assignment operator which is the key element of an assignment statement bin

11
00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.440
will look at C++ as arithmetic operators.

12
00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.590
These operators allow us to perform math very easily based on the math rules that we learned in school

13
00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:04.210
as kids will then look at the increment and decrement operators.

14
00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.760
These operators are often used in C++ and can be confusing.

15
00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.470
I'll walk you through how to use them so it's clear the common use case in programming is comparing

16
00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.490
two objects.

17
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.820
We often need to know if one object is less than greater than or equal to another object.

18
00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.340
And based on that result we decide what our next action will be.

19
00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.710
These are the relational operators after the relational operators will look at the logical operators

20
00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:35.200
the logical operators and I was to embed complex logic into our program so we can solve difficult problems.

21
00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:41.520
If we put together expressions containing relational and logical operators we can solve extremely complex

22
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.830
problems.

23
00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.750
Then we'll learn about C++ as compound assignment statements.

24
00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:52.550
They allow us to perform an operation and assign the result of that operation using a simple syntax.

25
00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.510
Finally we'll talk about operator precedence.

26
00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:58.810
Precedence determines in what order operators are executed.

27
00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.570
We've got a lot to cover in this section so let's get started.
