1
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:12,820
In this video we'll see how we can nest if statements within other statements.

2
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:18,410
Many times the logic we need to use in order to solve problems is more complex than just an if else

3
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:19,850
decision.

4
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:26,270
Many times we need several layers of logic since and if or if else statement is a statement then we

5
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:30,080
can use it in C++ anywhere a statement is legal.

6
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:35,600
So in this case we can replace the statement part of the if statement with an entire IF statement if

7
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,260
we want.

8
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:39,890
That's exactly what this example shows.

9
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:41,240
Notice the indentation.

10
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:44,040
It becomes even more important now.

11
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:47,880
In this case we can test multiple complex conditions easily.

12
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:50,270
So we evaluate expression one.

13
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:52,910
And if it's false we skip everything.

14
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,280
But if it's true then we test expression too.

15
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:59,340
And if it's true we execute statement 1.

16
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:07,270
If it's false we execute statement to we can continue by including if or if else statement says we need.

17
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:10,650
Notice that we have two ifs and only ONE ELSE.

18
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:14,170
In computer science this is called the dangling else problem.

19
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:17,300
And every programming language has to decide how to handle it.

20
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:26,020
The problem is which if does that else belong to him in C++ and else belongs to the closest.

21
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,590
If of course we can use block statements to achieve any logic we want.

22
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:32,210
Let's see another example.

23
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:39,970
In this example we check if score is greater than 90 if it is not.

24
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:44,910
Then we skip down to the bottom up statement and we display Sorry no way.

25
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,550
If the score is greater than 90 then we check the nested IF statement condition and check if scores

26
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:52,560
greater than 95.

27
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,710
If it is then we display an A plus.

28
00:01:54,750 --> 00:02:02,210
If it's not we display an AA in this slide we can see a flow chart that visually shows the flow of control

29
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,670
for the logic in this example.

30
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:06,640
Notice the first condition is checked.

31
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:08,520
Score greater than 90.

32
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,620
That's the expression in the first diamond on the left.

33
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:17,590
If true then we test the condition in the nested IF statement which is on the true branch.

34
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,820
Of course we can also use block statements as required to execute multiple statements.

35
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:29,060
In this example we're checking of Frank scores not equal to Bill's score.

36
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:31,920
If this fails that means that the scores are equal.

37
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:36,250
So we go to the else statement and display looks like a tie.

38
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:40,800
If their scores are not equal then we checked the condition the nested IF statement.

39
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:44,940
And if Frank scores greater than Bill score we display Frank wins.

40
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:47,010
Otherwise we display bill wins.

41
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:53,920
And these examples the nested IF has been in the true section of the if else statement we can have negative

42
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,950
statements in the L section as well.

43
00:02:56,230 --> 00:03:03,310
Let's go to the idea and see some examples of nested if statements OK what I want to do next is I want

44
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:09,800
to open up the grades project within the section 9 workspace again.

45
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,550
In this case the main is empty.

46
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:21,830
And I'm just going to get rid of this piece right here just to print out a new line at the end.

47
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:28,350
OK so what we're going to do here is this program is going to ask the user for the score on an exam

48
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:29,940
between 0 and 100.

49
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:34,710
And we're going to tell them the letter grade similar to what we did in the slides but we want to validate

50
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:38,380
to make sure that what they entered is actually between 0 and 100.

51
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:44,220
And if it isn't we're going to tell them Sorry you need to know the number you entered is out of range.

52
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:47,920
Also once we determine the users.

53
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:54,780
Once we determine the student's grade we'll tell them your grade is your letter grade A B C D F and

54
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:58,280
if they get an F we'll tell them sorry you have to repeat the class OK.

55
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,630
So let's start here.

56
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:05,570
First off we need a couple of variables let's just use one called score.

57
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:11,100
That's what we're going to ask the user for and we'll say see our let's do the input output part really

58
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:17,050
quickly I would just say enter your score on the exam.

59
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,490
And I suppose you were at a 100 here so they know what the range is

60
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:28,550
and we'll grab the and put in to score.

61
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:31,050
OK so now we've got what we want.

62
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:34,830
We also would like to have a variable called letter grade and what we're going to do is we're going

63
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:38,250
to assign a b c d or f into that variable.

64
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,840
We can simply use a character variable that will be fine.

65
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:48,810
I was going to say char letter grade and we'll just initialize it to zero.

66
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:53,850
OK so now first thing we need to do is we need to validate that score.

67
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:57,070
We need to make sure that the score is between 0 and 100.

68
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:58,980
So we'll use a simple IF statement here.

69
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:09,730
So we'll see if the score is greater than or equal to zero and the score is less than or equal to 100.

70
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:11,020
I'll use a block here.

71
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:12,620
We need to do the true part right.

72
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:15,460
This is where we need to calculate their grade.

73
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:22,580
But if it's not then right here we want to say else and I'll do another block statement.

74
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:25,730
And in this case what we want to say is sorry

75
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:35,780
we'll say sorry and we'll tell them that the number they entered

76
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,170
is not in range.

77
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:47,090
Something Real Simple when we learn about looping in a couple of videos from now we'll be able to ask

78
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:48,230
them to enter it again.

79
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:52,310
But in this case this will be fine.

80
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:55,540
And let's test this.

81
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:59,720
A lot of times when we test our code you see there's nothing in here right now.

82
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:07,340
So we just do something like this and we expect to see that output in the positive case right in the

83
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:08,450
true case.

84
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:13,320
We're going to write code and actually calculate the grade but it's good to test as you go.

85
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:18,260
Don't write all your code all at once and then try to test it all at the end just test as you go and

86
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:19,250
you'll be much better off.

87
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:23,680
So let's try this let's run this get an error here.

88
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:27,330
Sorry no it's not no score.

89
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:27,960
There we go.

90
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:31,690
So there we go.

91
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:33,490
Enter your score on the exam.

92
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:36,480
Let's enter something valid like 70.

93
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:38,480
We should get the x's displayed.

94
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:39,070
There they are.

95
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:40,290
So we're good here.

96
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:44,510
And let's run it one more time and type in 120.

97
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,630
Sorry 120 is not in range.

98
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:52,760
And let's try something like negative 1 Sorry negative 1 is not in range cool.

99
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:59,650
So our logic seems to be right now what we need to do is write the logic in this piece right here that's

100
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,980
actually calculating there.

101
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,300
Great.

102
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:03,660
All right.

103
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:09,010
So what we can do here is we can write the if else if else if type code.

104
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:12,940
When I learned this stuff a long time ago that was called an if else ladder.

105
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,280
I haven't heard that term in a long time but it makes kind of sense because it does look like a ladder.

106
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:23,320
So what we'll do here is we'll say we'll use that same grading scale 98 76 he will say if the score

107
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:30,700
is greater than 90 and I'm not going to use blocks here just to save some some space on the screen we'll

108
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:37,180
save the letter grade and we'll assign an A to it and I notice that's a character.

109
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:39,720
So so those are single quotes not double quotes.

110
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:53,910
So we've got that and will say else if score is greater than 80 we'll say that her grade is a B again

111
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,890
single quotes don't forget the semi-colon.

112
00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:03,620
Else if you get the idea we're just walking right down that ladder.

113
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:10,270
If it's greater than 70 then the letter grade in this case is a C

114
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:19,640
couple more else if the score is greater than 60

115
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:28,530
then the letter grade is a D.

116
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:33,180
And finally there's our catch all else in which case there are letter grade is an F.

117
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:42,120
OK let's try that out run this and we'll test it with a few numbers.

118
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:47,890
And I said greater than 90 I probably should have said greater than or equal to 90.

119
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:49,260
But it's all good.

120
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:50,590
So we'll say 91.

121
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:52,970
That's definitely anay.

122
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:54,690
We never printed out.

123
00:08:54,760 --> 00:09:00,050
So that's two that this is why we test track C out.

124
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:07,560
Your grade is and we'll just display letter grade here.

125
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,230
Put it in line at the end.

126
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:21,360
OK now remember when I put this here fix that reader will see this it will execute no matter what.

127
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,850
So this if statement will execute one of those letters will be signed and then be displayed here.

128
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:27,780
Try that again.

129
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,880
So in this case we've got a 91.

130
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:31,320
That should be anay.

131
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,090
Your grade is an A.

132
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:36,030
The 81 should be a B.

133
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:40,570
It is still about a 50 which is definitely an F..

134
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,170
And here we go OK.

135
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:45,420
Obviously you would test this a little better.

136
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,330
But for the sake of time I'm not going to do that.

137
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:51,900
The last thing we want to do is right here we want to tell them.

138
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:54,050
Did they pass or did they fail.

139
00:09:54,410 --> 00:10:00,170
Well the only way you can fail in this example is if your better grade is an F and so there's no sense

140
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:01,400
in checking the score again.

141
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,020
We've already got the letter grade.

142
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:11,570
So I'm simply going to say if the letter grade is equal to an F doubled member double equal sign on

143
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:13,190
a single equal sign.

144
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:15,810
If that's the case C out

145
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:22,130
sorry you must repeat this class

146
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:28,910
ok.

147
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:30,630
Otherwise you passed

148
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:44,340
Gretz that's a passing grade or whatever you want to enter in here.

149
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:45,680
All right so that should do it.

150
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,510
Let's go through this real quick one more time.

151
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,280
We've got their score here.

152
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,820
We're prompting for the score and we're reading it in.

153
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:55,800
If the score is within range we do the calculation.

154
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:00,830
If it's not within range we're down here and we're out right away sorry the score is out of range.

155
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,620
We clean that up a little bit.

156
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:06,830
If the score is within range then we're going to use this if else latter.

157
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:11,490
And if it's greater than 90 it's an a greater than 80 to be we're going to walk all the way down.

158
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:15,610
You know what let me put equal signs here because it's it's bugging me

159
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,730
that it matches the slides that I gave you.

160
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:23,240
OK.

161
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,280
So that's a little better.

162
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:28,610
So now if it's greater than 90 you get the day and all the way through the AM who we're here.

163
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:30,230
Your grade is your letter grade.

164
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,960
And then we check to see if an F is just an F you must repeat the class.

165
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,650
OK let's run this now with a couple of test cases.

166
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:42,660
Suppose you got you are 90 now and should be DNA because we had the greater than or equal to your grade

167
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,440
as in a kind of Gratz.

168
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:50,220
If your grade is fifty nine your grade is an F..

169
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,560
Sorry you must repeat this class OK.

170
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,070
So there you go.

171
00:11:53,070 --> 00:12:01,470
That's a simple example of using the if else if and the if else statements together on the next example

172
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:11,680
we're going to open up the shipping project in the section 9 workspace.

173
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:19,170
So we're in the shipping project of the section 9 workspace and I've gone ahead and started this little

174
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:21,730
example just so we save a little time.

175
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:26,000
And what we're doing here is we're doing we're using a shipping cost calculator.

176
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:31,140
We're going to ask the user for the package dimension in inches and the package is dimensions would

177
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:34,510
be length width and height and they all integers.

178
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:38,420
The dimension must be 10 inches or less for each dimension.

179
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:40,220
Otherwise we can't ship it.

180
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:43,690
The base costs for shipping is two dollars and fifty cents.

181
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:50,100
And if the package volume is greater than 100 cubic inches there's a 10 percent surcharge if the package

182
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:55,110
volume is greater than 500 cubic inches there's a 25 percent surcharge.

183
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:55,600
Okay.

184
00:12:55,770 --> 00:13:00,420
So I started this already and I've got some variable set up and let me talk about them really quickly

185
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:05,580
we've got obviously we need the length the width and height that's what the user is going to enter.

186
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:11,580
And we've got the base costs which is a double $2 and 50 Cent so I've initialized that then we've got

187
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:14,220
a couple of other constants here.

188
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:17,170
One the Tier 1 threshold that's the volume.

189
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:25,050
So again if you exceed 100 cubic inches that kicks in and we've got to Tier 2 threshold to be 500 cubic

190
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:31,260
inches so I've defined those as constants the maximum dimension for any length is 10 inches.

191
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:37,540
And I've got the Tier 1 surcharge at 10 percent and the Tier 2 surcharge at 25 percent.

192
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:38,700
So that's pretty much it.

193
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:43,440
I've got all these constants and variables declared so that I can use them.

194
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:43,890
All right.

195
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:48,600
I also have another integer here called the package volume which obviously we need to calculate.

196
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:50,880
So this is where we're at.

197
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:51,460
Hello.

198
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,360
Welcome to the package cost calculator.

199
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:56,940
Enter the length width and height of the package separated by spaces.

200
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:03,350
And we've just read the length the width and the height into these variables.

201
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,430
Now we need to do our logic for the calculation of the package.

202
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:11,700
First thing we should do is let's make sure that the package is valid right.

203
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,470
Otherwise there's nothing to do.

204
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:23,490
So what we can do here is we can say if the length of the package is greater than the maximum dimensions

205
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:37,770
write the max dimension length which is 10 for everything or the width is greater than the max dimension

206
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:44,700
or the height is greater than max dimension.

207
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:52,370
Right if any one of those is greater than the maximum allowed dimension for any one side we really have

208
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:53,210
nothing to do.

209
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:53,910
Done.

210
00:14:54,020 --> 00:15:02,510
So in this case what we want to do here is we want to say see out sorry package rejected or something

211
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:04,230
like that.

212
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:07,820
Dimensions exceeded

213
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:15,480
okay or some some message that tells them what's going on.

214
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:18,440
OK.

215
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:20,620
So that takes care of that.

216
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,260
Now here's the else part.

217
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:22,560
Right.

218
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:26,610
And we may as well put this in a block because we never know when you're going to add code to this or

219
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:30,340
put a Curlee here and a Cur-Lee here.

220
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:33,850
Now I can add code in there easily.

221
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:41,560
So that's my my if part this is when the package has been rejected the else part is now where we're

222
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,120
going to do all our calculations.

223
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:50,020
So again I'm going to do see out and do a quick test to make sure that we're compiling and everything

224
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:50,960
looks good.

225
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:58,800
So we want to run this and I'm running the old project that double click on shipping and it's Try that

226
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:02,500
and to the length width OK.

227
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:11,310
So let's say I'm exceeding right so much say 12 8 and 12 5 and 3 so the 12 should be over.

228
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:13,690
Sorry package rejected dimension exceeded.

229
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:14,640
That's good.

230
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:17,040
We could do test cases for all three of them right.

231
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:22,900
I'm not going to just to save a little time and in this case six seven and eight that's valid.

232
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:26,440
And we print out the three x's and we're ready to do our calculation.

233
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,270
OK.

234
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:33,510
So I mean get rid of that statement that I just did and that hello world on here at the bottom.

235
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:37,200
Right so now in here what we need to do is our calculations.

236
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:43,170
So we need to know what the package cost is right so we need to have a double in here we can do that

237
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:48,220
right inside the block because the only time we're going to use it is if we're going to do some calculation.

238
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:55,170
So in this case I could just say package cost and I can just initialize that to zero.

239
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:01,440
And how about the package volume again I could have defined that in here as well but it's already defined

240
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:09,910
outside the package volume is the length time the width times tonight.

241
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:18,300
OK so now we've got our package volume here is being calculated as the product of those three dimensions.

242
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:26,830
And we may as well say that the package cost is the base cost right right now we could start with that.

243
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:31,750
It's always going to be $2 or 50 cents plus perhaps some surcharge.

244
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,370
Okay so that's where we're at.

245
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:34,850
So far so good.

246
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:38,910
Now we need to do these checks for the package volume exceeding those thresholds.

247
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:43,860
What we want to do for us is we want to check the the Tier 2 threshold because it's the highest.

248
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:54,250
So what we want to do here is we want to see if the package volume is greater than the Tier 2 threshold.

249
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:58,900
If that's the case then the package cost

250
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:12,750
plus equals we're incrementing by the package cost times the Tier 2 surcharge.

251
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:18,390
Remember we're incrementing the left hand side by the right hand side and we could put a debug statement

252
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:18,780
in here.

253
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:27,180
Again it's very common to do that just saying adding Tier 2 surcharge you get rid of these when we ship

254
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:33,090
the code but it's nice to have them in here soon I'll teach you how to use a debugger which makes this

255
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:34,710
even easier.

256
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:46,470
OK so if this is not the case then we can say else if the package volume exceeds the Tier 1 threshold

257
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:58,710
and if that's the case we can basically just copy this and paste it in here.

258
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:05,930
In this case the package cost is the plus equals package cost times the Tier 1 surcharge and we can

259
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:08,620
just change that statement right here to do that.

260
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:11,190
OK.

261
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:20,090
So we're really done what we need to do now is say seek out the volume we'll give the user some information.

262
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:22,120
The volume of your package

263
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:33,290
is and will display the volume package volume.

264
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:38,620
We have an end line here and then we'll just tell them how much it's going to cost and that's really

265
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:41,970
what they want.

266
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:47,410
Your package will cost you put a dollar sign here.

267
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:53,170
And I believe it was package cost.

268
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:53,910
There it is

269
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:57,330
to ship

270
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,150
and that should do it.

271
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:07,680
Clean up some of this white space and we'll run this and then we'll do one more little thing before

272
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:11,190
we go and see Tier 1 surcharge.

273
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:12,250
I spelled it wrong.

274
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:15,300
She need an underscore right there.

275
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:20,220
And that that way you can see some of these errors.

276
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:20,610
Perfect.

277
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:28,520
So let's say five five and five I'm adding a tier 1 surcharge because the volume is greater than 100

278
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:30,030
You can see are 125.

279
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:33,420
So the package will cost 275 to ship.

280
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:39,160
Let's make it a little bit bigger the package that say it's 8 by 8 by 8.

281
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:42,100
In this case I'm adding a tier 2 surcharge.

282
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:48,940
The vault the package volume was 512 and it's going to cost three dollars and twelve cents to ship.

283
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:49,940
Okay.

284
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:53,040
Now you know this is 3.1 to 5 displays.

285
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:56,190
I'll show you how to set that up a little bit later in the course.

286
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,460
But for now just for how to do it really quickly.

287
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:08,580
If you come up to the includes And you include I O my net that's the input output manipulators.

288
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:14,910
And then right before you start printing the dollar amounts we're actually anywhere you can put this

289
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:25,180
anywhere you could just say see out fixed followed by set precision to 2 decimals after the Packers

290
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:25,810
this is

291
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:31,830
that just prints dollars nicely.

292
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:36,020
So if we run this again let's try that again.

293
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:38,680
We'll do 8 7 and 9.

294
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:41,880
You could see it printed up nicely three dollars and twelve cents.

295
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:46,440
And again I'll talk about those manipulators a little bit later on it just helps us look at our code

296
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,760
a little nicer.

297
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:48,080
All right.

298
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:48,790
