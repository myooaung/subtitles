1
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:05,920
All right.

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,800
So let's get ready for the challenge.

3
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:12,610
This is a pretty simple challenge that's based on what are the problems that we solved in this section.

4
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:17,860
If you recall we had a problem for crank's carpet cleaning service where Frank charge so much per room.

5
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:23,860
While this is a little bit different in this case Frank has two charges one for small rooms and one

6
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:24,790
for large rooms.

7
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:30,490
So as you can see here he charges $25 for small rooms and $35 for larger rooms.

8
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,740
The sales tax rate is still 6 percent.

9
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:35,220
And estimates are still valid for 30 days.

10
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:40,390
So what you need to do here is prompt the user both for how many small rooms they want cleated how many

11
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:45,280
large rooms they want cleaned and then provide an estimate that looks something like this number of

12
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:45,940
small rooms.

13
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:52,630
For example 3 number of large rooms one price per small room $25 price per large room $35.

14
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:57,580
Calculate the cost calculate the tax and then come up with the total estimate and tell them that the

15
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:59,370
estimate is valid for 30 days.

16
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:00,040
Okay.

17
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:01,700
So hopefully that makes a lot of sense.

18
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,190
And here's a sample run that you can see.

19
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:04,970
So here.

20
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:08,760
Hello welcome to Frank's carpet cleaning service how many small rooms would you like clean.

21
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:13,440
Let's say I want three small rooms cleaned and one large room clean.

22
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:19,060
And you could see here the estimate is number of small rooms three number of large rooms one that's

23
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:24,930
what I just typed in the price per small rooms is 25 their price per large room is 35.

24
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:26,540
And the cost is 110.

25
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:32,770
If you do the math you can see that three times 25 is 75 plus 35 is 110.

26
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:39,520
Six percent of that is $6 is 60 cents if you add it all together you get $116 to 60 cents and then you

27
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,160
display this estimate is valid for 30 days.

28
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:42,420
All right.

29
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:43,560
So give it a shot.

30
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,470
Take your time.

31
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:45,980
I'm sure you'll do it just fine.

32
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:50,390
If you want to see the solution in the next video I'll present my solution to this problem.
