00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.760
Hello and welcome to beginning C++ programming.

2
00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.660
Thank you very much for enrolling in this course and placing your confidence in the Learn Programming

3
00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:19.120
Academy team and in me for your training. In this video I'd like to introduce you to the course.

4
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.350
But first I'd like to introduce myself.

5
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.160
My name is Frank Mitropoulos and I'll be your instructor for this course.

6
00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.380
You can read more about me in the course bio.

7
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:31.710
But I want you to be sure that I will do everything I can to make sure the course content is correct,

8
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.700
relevant, understandable, and hopefully fun.

9
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.310
I've been a University computer science professor for many years.

10
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:44.310
I've also worked in industry as a programmer, software engineer, and project manager.  I've taugh thousands of students

11
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:50.700
in both academia and industry how to program using many programming languages but C++ is my favorite

12
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.090
language to teach.

13
00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.700
I first learned C++ back in 1988 and I've used it ever since.

14
00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.930
That's quite a long time ago and C++ has evolved greatly since then.

15
00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.170
I'm very excited to teach this course.

16
00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.320
I hope you're also excited about learning C++ in this course.

17
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.160
I assume that you're completely new to C++.

18
00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.070
I also assume that you have little if any programming experience with other programming languages.

19
00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.580
If you do have programming experience that's great.

20
00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:23.640
This course is still for you since you'll definitely learn C++. The course curriculum has been developed

21
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.260
in a way that introduces new topics in a specific order.

22
00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.970
I encourage you to follow along one section at a time and before you know it you'll be writing C++ programs

23
00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.890
that solve problems. In this course.

24
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.690
I'll cover modern C++.

25
00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.350
I'll talk more about just exactly what modern C++ is as we go through the course.

26
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.350
But rest assured that you'll be learning C++ as it should be used today.

27
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.400
Over the years I've worked with many many students and I can only remember a few that just didn't get

28
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.470
programming.

29
00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.480
I still think that if they tried a little harder then program it would have clicked at some point.

30
00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.490
If you're new to programming you will at some point in this course feel frustrated.

31
00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:03.990
This is perfectly normal.

32
00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.330
Programming is a skill that must be learned and practiced.

33
00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.920
Do uou play a musical instrument?

34
00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.850
Do you remember what it sounded like the first time you played?

35
00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.740
Do you remember wanting to smash that guitar or a piano because you just couldn't get it?

36
00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:16.850
Programming is similar.

37
00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.150
You must practice and practice to get better.

38
00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.440
If you get frustrated take a break and try again a bit later.

39
00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.510
Remember we've all been there.

40
00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:29.760
I still remember the first program I ever wrote it was back in 1980 using a programming language called

41
00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.510
Fortran 77.

42
00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.900
I was so excited that I was able to program a computer to do exactly what I wanted it to do.

43
00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.520
The program was pretty simple.

44
00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:43.980
It asked the user for an amount in US dollars and then displayed how many quarters,  dimes,  nickels,  and

45
00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:49.320
pennies it would take to add up to that entered amount. We'll do the same problem in this course.

46
00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.790
I also remember that it took me a couple.

47
00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:56.970
OK maybe more than a couple of attempts before it was correct but man what a great feeling when it ran

48
00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.120
correctly!!  In this course.

49
00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.580
each section ends with a challenge exercise.

50
00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.570
These will help reinforce the concepts presented in the section to help in learning the material.

51
00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.980
Once you finish the challenge don't stop there.

52
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.920
Challenge yourself.

53
00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.590
Come up with similar problems on your own and solve them. Then do it again and again.

54
00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:15.440
Make it fun.

55
00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.150
Make the problems silly if you want to.

56
00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.220
It doesn't matter it's all about practice.

57
00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.310
Finally if you have any questions at all please ask them in the forums.

58
00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.730
I will personally monitor the forums and respond to questions.  Before you post though,  browse the already

59
00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.660
answered questions since your question may already have an answer.

60
00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.370
Well enough talk.

61
00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.090
I look forward to working with everyone.

62
00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.900
Let's start learning C++.
