Programming isn't just about getting in front of a computer and writing code.

2
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.000
There are syntax and rules to follow best practices and lots of thought involved.

3
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.620
We also have to learn how to handle errors and know what they mean and how to fix them and more.

4
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.430
So we've included quizzes at the end of most of the sections in this course.

5
00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:29.380
The quizzes are for you to see how well you can apply the concepts presented in each section and to

6
00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.880
reinforce the material presented.

7
00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.530
Some questions are easy and some are more difficult.

8
00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:39.490
I urge you to go through the quizzes I think you'll find them challenging but still fun.

9
00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:44.890
Each quiz has 10 questions and there are multiple choice and fill in the blank type questions.

10
00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:50.680
The quizzes are more concept oriented where the section challenge exercises are more code oriented.

11
00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:56.240
But sometimes the quiz questions may ask you about a specific piece of code and what you think it displays.

12
00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.650
I hope you find the quizzes as well as the challenge exercises useful for your learning experience.

13
00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.850
Ok frank enough talk let's get started learning C++.
