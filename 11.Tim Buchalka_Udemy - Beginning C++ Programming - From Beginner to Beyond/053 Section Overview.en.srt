00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:12,140
In this section of the Course will learn about our first compound data type compound type has a type

2
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:14,380
that's made up of other types.

3
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:17,910
First we'll learn about arrays what they are and why we use them.

4
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:23,720
We'll go over the syntax for declaring and initializing arrays and we'll learn how to access the individual

5
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:25,450
elements of an array.

6
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:27,600
Then we'll talk about multi dimensional arrays.

7
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,480
These can be two dimensional or three dimensional arrays or they can be as many dimensions as you need

8
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:38,470
they can be very useful for modeling grids boards and much more complex data types.

9
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:40,250
Then we'll learn about vectors.

10
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:44,520
Vectors are better than arrays in so many ways and we'll discuss their advantages.

11
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:48,410
In fact in modern C++ we rarely use raw arrays.

12
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:50,020
Instead we use vectors.

13
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:52,150
So why cover arrays at all.

14
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:58,220
I think it's important to understand arrays since there's so much legacy C++ code out there and conceptually

15
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:02,500
they're easy to understand and they'll add to your overall knowledge of C++.

16
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:07,030
OK so let's get started learning about our first compound data type arrays.
