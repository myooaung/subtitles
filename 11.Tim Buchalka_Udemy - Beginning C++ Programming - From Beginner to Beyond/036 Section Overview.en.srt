1
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,890
In this section of the course will take a look at the basic structure of a simple C++ program.

2
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:14,280
First we'll look at the basic components of a C++ program.

3
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:20,850
These includes things like keywords identifiers operators punctuation comments and syntax.

4
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,580
Then we'll discuss the preprocessor directives that C++ uses.

5
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:28,830
These are the statements that begin with the pound sign or the hash tag.

6
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,730
And we'll discuss what they do and how they work.

7
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:36,370
Well then take a look at the main function specifically and functions in general.

8
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:42,380
Then we'll discuss what C++ namespace is in way we use the standard shape space so often that's the

9
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:44,380
best T-word reviews throughout.

10
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,650
Well then learn about the types of comments that C++ supports and why we use comments in our code at

11
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:50,540
all.

12
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:54,800
Finally we'll talk about basic stream input output using C in and C out.

13
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:55,850
Let's get started.
