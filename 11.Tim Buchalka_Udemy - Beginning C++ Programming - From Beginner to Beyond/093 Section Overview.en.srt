00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:08,810
In this section we'll talk about characters and strings.

2
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:14,020
As we've already seen the character type can hold values that represent characters.

3
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:20,020
These values are basically integers that map to a character set like the ASCII character set.

4
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:27,670
And we've also seen that strings or sequences of characters C++ supports two types of strings C-style

5
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:30,470
strings and C++ strings.

6
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:33,510
So will first look at the CC type library.

7
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,050
This is a library of very simple but very useful functions that work with characters.

8
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:44,590
For example we can test characters to see if they're uppercase or lowercase numeric alphanumeric punctuation

9
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:45,760
and more.

10
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:52,470
We can also convert characters between lower and upper case after we learn about the CC type functions.

11
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,100
We'll talk about strings.

12
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:58,280
As I said earlier you can think of strings as a sequence of characters.

13
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:03,100
So far we've only use string literals which were represented as a sequence of characters inside double

14
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:04,070
quotes.

15
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:11,270
I'll discuss both C-style strings and C++ strings in this section and give you the basics of using each.

16
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:17,020
However you should be using C++ strings in modern C plus plus I think you'll understand why at the end

17
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:23,040
of this section first we'll see what C-style strings are and how they are represented in memory.

18
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:27,550
Then we'll see how to work with C-style strings using some of the string functions available in the

19
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:31,290
C string and C standard lib libraries.

20
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:38,740
Then we'll learn about C++ strings C++ strings or objects just like our vectors were and their use using

21
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:41,280
an object oriented style of programming.

22
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:47,260
In this section we learn how to declare initialize assign compare and use some of the other C++ string

23
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:51,350
methods methods or functions that work with objects.

24
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:54,070
So let's look at C-style strings first in the next video.
