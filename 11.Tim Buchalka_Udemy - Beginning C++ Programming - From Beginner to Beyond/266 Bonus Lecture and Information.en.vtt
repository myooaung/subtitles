00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.930
Congratulations on reaching the end of this course.

2
00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:07.650
I'm a timber checker from the loan program the academy and the loan program Academy is the publisher

3
00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:08.720
of this course.

4
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.100
So this quick video is set designed to get some free and valuable development information into your

5
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.930
hands today.

6
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.240
You know when I was studying way back in the 1980s witch hunt was a long time ago.

7
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.920
It was hard to succeed as a programmer.

8
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.410
There was no internet for starters but also other than books or universities or colleges.

9
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.080
There really was no way to basically talk to anyone or get access to the information you needed to succeed.

10
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.130
So you were largely on your own in other words.

11
00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.740
So I wanted to change all that and give you all the tools and information you need to succeed.

12
00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.370
And as such I'm trying to pass on my wisdom and experience to make your goals of becoming a programmer

13
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.110
or getting a better programming job.

14
00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.080
I make that goal a reality for you.

15
00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.210
So I'm gonna promise you here here now that the information that I've put together is really useful.

16
00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.280
He was a developer and it will make a difference.

17
00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.510
So let me explain the information I'm giving away to you.

18
00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.740
Free today.

19
00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.750
So firstly I'm giving a free access to my learn to code course.

20
00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.160
And in this course it's different to the courses that I've been producing or Udemy because it's designed

21
00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.670
to help you understand how programming works but how computers work under the hood.

22
00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.120
So I'm talking right down to circuits and switches how the hardware works but also how where computers

23
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.610
talk in any one language binary and machine code.

24
00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.940
Things like that nature which you don't normally learn in a particular course.

25
00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:29.550
So all of this though is designed to teach you information you need as proof from a perspective of a

26
00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.520
program that's going to help you or make you a better programmer.

27
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.690
Long term that's the sole aim in that course.

28
00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.480
So you can access to that free.

29
00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.740
Next I'm going to give you free access again to my programmers guide in e-book format.

30
00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:48.870
Now that also has over 100 related videos which will get access to well as if I can get it out access

31
00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:52.320
to as well on all aspects of your programming career.

32
00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:58.470
So the e-book and videos collectively answer pretty well all the important questions certainly the majority

33
00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:04.470
of them are relating to basically programming careers and some of the sample questions that are actually

34
00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.980
answers is how long does it take to become a developer whether you need a degree to make it as a developer

35
00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.600
what's the number one skill we need to have to succeed as a programmer.

36
00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.840
Now are you too old to become a developer and what other one do you need to be good at math to succeed

37
00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:19.530
as a programmer.

38
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.020
But there's a ton more over 100 as I mentioned in the 160 videos as of the date that I'm recording this

39
00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:30.360
video and you'll get all of those the answers to those questions and look I even take requests for future

40
00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.710
videos.

41
00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.550
So if you've got a particular question and it's not answered in the over 100 the birdie answered some

42
00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.860
of your message and I actually do a video on that as well.

43
00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:43.020
So basically anything you need to know about your programming career is answered in the e-book and also

44
00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.040
the related videos.

45
00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.210
What else is still what more did not say this is all for anyway I'm selling something that's for free

46
00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:49.050
anyway.

47
00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:55.170
But seriously though I'll also give you access to my programmers career paths people and this is something

48
00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:01.380
that is really important because it shows you the exact courses that you need to study to achieve your

49
00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:02.520
career goals.

50
00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.980
So in other words as an example do you want to be a web developer.

51
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.060
I'll give you the lowdown on the specific courses you need to become a web developer.

52
00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:15.900
Do you want to say right cross platform apps for mobile apps for IOW an android study these courses.

53
00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.330
Again I'll go through those particular courses perhaps want to get into the Java Enterprise space.

54
00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.320
When I do that study these courses so on and so forth so I'm putting the finishing touches now to that

55
00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:30.360
guide and depending when you're watching this video it may already be available but if not it won't

56
00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.990
be far away.

57
00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:35.730
Either case you'll be getting access to that particular e-book for free as well.

58
00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.130
All right and lastly cause I know this video is dragging on a bit.

59
00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.990
The learn programming Academy's channel has 40 other courses here and you to me.

60
00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:46.890
So I'm going to give you the information a bit of a summary of what each of those courses are all about

61
00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.280
but also with a big discount link to get them at the best price possible as well.

62
00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:52.460
So what's the catch here.

63
00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:53.460
How much to pay.

64
00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.440
Seriously though I'm not really a salesman.

65
00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.980
No catch.

66
00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:57.860
It's a hundred percent free.

67
00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:58.320
Right.

68
00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:01.460
How do you access this material or download the e-book.

69
00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:02.100
That's right.

70
00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:06.380
In this lecture that you're watching right now just click on the resources that you can see on screen

71
00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:11.340
now on this particular lecture and click on the bonus PDA of which you can see there.

72
00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.210
Open it up and it's got everything you need to access all the information that I've talked about here

73
00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.590
today.

74
00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:21.150
So thanks for watching and you may find you need to be logged onto a computer to get the e-book because

75
00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.060
it may or may not show up if you're on a mobile device.

76
00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.230
So if you don't see it showing up when you're clicking on resources or in fact resources doesn't show

77
00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:31.140
up lock into a computer and you should have access to that.

78
00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:34.390
Just click it as I said open it up and the information is in that PDA.

79
00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:35.780
But if you do get stuck.

80
00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:40.590
Drop me a message on udemy and I'll get back to you and make sure that you do actually get the access

81
00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.430
to that PDA today.

82
00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.720
All right so I get to download the e-book right now while you remember.

83
00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.040
And thanks again for watching.

84
00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.080
And I look forward to hearing about your future success.
