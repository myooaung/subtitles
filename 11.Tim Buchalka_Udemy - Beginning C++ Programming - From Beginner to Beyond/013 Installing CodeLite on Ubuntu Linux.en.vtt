00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:12.810
This video we'll be installing the code light ID or integrated development environment on the Ubuntu

2
00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:17.810
Linux platform code like is a free open source cross-platform.

3
00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:24.150
Ideally that works with C++ and it works across Windows Linux as well as Mac.

4
00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:32.760
So we'll start by opening up your favorite browser and going to code light that c o d e I t DRG and

5
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:36.250
you'll get a web page similar to this and you want to find a download link.

6
00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:37.560
Now there's one at the top menu.

7
00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.330
There's also this big blue button here.

8
00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.680
That's the one I'm going to use.

9
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.560
So I'm just going to select Code like to download and you can give a contribution to the developers

10
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.310
if you wish or you can go straight to the downloads which is what I'll do here.

11
00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.380
Now we're we're going to download code like 11.0 which is a stable release and we're going to download

12
00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:59.760
this for Ubuntu.

13
00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:04.770
Now you can see here you've got a Windows Installer Noas 10 installer and so forth and you can refer

14
00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:07.300
to those videos if that's the platform you're on.

15
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:14.100
But this specific video is for butu Linux so you can see here it says set up code like repository for

16
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.800
Ubuntu that's the one I'm going to select a word of caution.

17
00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.110
These commands are run as super user as you can see here with a.

18
00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.150
So be very careful when you type things and make sure you're typing things exactly correctly.

19
00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.950
What I'm doing is I'm not even going to type I'm simply going to copy and paste.

20
00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.110
That way I know that I'm making no mistakes.

21
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.610
OK.

22
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.690
So first step is to copy this one line right here.

23
00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:43.170
And basically what we've got to do is a lot of information on this page regarding official and unofficial

24
00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.550
and so forth and I'll show you the one that worked great for me.

25
00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.260
So what we're going to do is we're going to copy this line of code here then we're going to copy this

26
00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:53.510
line of code here.

27
00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.510
And the version I've got is email universe so that's the one I'm going to.

28
00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.310
Sixteen point zero for about two.

29
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.140
So that's the one I'm going to choose.

30
00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.140
And then we're going to do a couple more lines and that's it.

31
00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.490
Now the install takes quite a while.

32
00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:10.220
The last time I did this install it was about 10 minutes 15 minutes on my machine.

33
00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:15.000
So I'm going to pause the video as the install happens and we're going to do the installing a terminal

34
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.360
window so you can see the terminal windows here.

35
00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.890
I've opened it up so I'm going to make this just a little smaller so we can do both at once.

36
00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.090
You can see what's going on.

37
00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.500
OK.

38
00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:25.010
Perfect.

39
00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.170
So let's get started.

40
00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:33.720
Let's copy this first line right here and I'm going to copy and paste it over here.

41
00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.940
Press enter and it's going to ask you for your password.

42
00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.080
Obviously you have to have root access or be super user to install this code.

43
00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.500
So I want to press enter.

44
00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.210
And that takes care of the first line.

45
00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:51.290
I'm going to scroll down and get the second line now.

46
00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:58.350
Make sure that you replace this string here with the correct distribution of your bunch of mine is Zino

47
00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.040
So that's when I'm going to use.

48
00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.440
I'm going to copy this just like that.

49
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.010
I'll paste it.

50
00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:12.380
This time it won't ask me for my password then I'll go down to the third line which is the update

51
00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.480
copy that and paste as well.

52
00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.970
That'll just take us a few minutes.

53
00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:29.410
OK that's done.

54
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:37.400
Now the last line is one that takes a long time to install someone to copy paste Precentor.

55
00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:43.120
And I'll go have a cup of coffee and a little bit it says here after this operation we need 451 megabytes

56
00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.980
of space.

57
00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:50.980
I've got plenty of space so that's fine and I'll just say continue yes and I'll pause the video now

58
00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.910
and be back in about 10 minutes.

59
00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:01.260
At this point cold light has now been installed and the next video will run it and configure.
