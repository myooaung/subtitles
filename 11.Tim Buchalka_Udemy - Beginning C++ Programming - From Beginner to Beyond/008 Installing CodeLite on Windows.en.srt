00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:10,950
This video will go over the steps necessary to download and install the CodeLite integrated development

2
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:14,870
environment for C++ on the Windows platform.

3
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:20,520
CodeLite is a free, open source, cross-platform integrated development environment that works across

4
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,770
Windows, Mac, and Linux.

5
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:27,330
And this is the IDE that I'm going to use in this class.
In order to download it,

6
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:33,310
open up your favorite browser and go to codelite, C O D E L I T E dot org.

7
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:38,400
You'll get a page that looks similar to this and what you want to do is find a download link.

8
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:42,540
You can find it up here on the menu bar or you can find it right here as well, on the big blue button.

9
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:48,150
So I'll select that and it takes you to a page where you can make a donation to the developers if you wish.

10
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:52,310
If not, just take me straight to the downloads and I'll sect that.

11
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:58,350
And you've got a couple of options here for Windows.
if you want to download the weekly builds you can

12
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:02,900
download that for the 64 bit Windows machines right here at the top.

13
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:07,620
And currently it's CodeLite 10.0.7.  That's the one I've been using and it's very

14
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:08,790
very stable.

15
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:14,850
You can also download the stable release 10.0 for Windows 64 or 32 bit.

16
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:19,770
Now if you're not sure whether you have a 64 bit machine or a 32 bit machine. Go over to your Control

17
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:28,950
Panel and select System and Security and then System. And in the System information right here you'll see

18
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:35,160
System type and it will say 64 bit operating system or 32 bit operating system depending what you've

19
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:35,940
got.

20
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:41,880
So I'll close this down. In my case I have a 64 bit system so I'm going to use the stable release

21
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:49,880
for Windows 64 bit and I can just click the direct link and that'll start the download. The download

22
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:51,080
can take some time.

23
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:52,010
It's not a big file.

24
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:56,250
But the connection tends to be slow to the site, so I'll pause the video while that occurs.

25
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,990
So the download is now complete.

26
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:03,990
What I'm going to do is open it up in the folder and it's basically a compressed file which I'm going

27
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:07,240
to extract right to here and then I'm going to run the installer.

28
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:13,120
But before I do that I'm going to close the browser. Let's run that installer.

29
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:19,950
I'm going to allow the app to make changes to my device and I'm going to close this folder just to clear

30
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:20,880
up some of the clutter.

31
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:24,160
Now what you want to do here is just basically follow the setup wizard.

32
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:32,640
So, I'm going to select Next. I'm going to accept the GNU license agreement and press Next.  I'm going

33
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:41,830
to install this to the default location C:\ Program Files\CodeLite and press Next and press Next again.

34
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:47,200
And I want to create a desktop icon just to make it easier for myself and I'll press Next one more time.

35
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:52,770
And then finally we can install the installation. It's really quick.

36
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,990
And once it's done it's going to ask you if you want to launch CodeLite.

37
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:00,090
I'm not going to launch it yet.

38
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:05,280
I'm just going to finish the installation and in the next video will go over the launching and the configuration

39
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:05,820
of CodeLite.
