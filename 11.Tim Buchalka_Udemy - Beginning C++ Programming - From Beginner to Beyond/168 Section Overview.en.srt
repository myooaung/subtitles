1
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:10,740
In this section we'll learn about one of the most useful features of object oriented programming languages

2
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:15,380
inheritance conceptually inheritance is easy to understand.

3
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:19,120
However inheritance in C++ can be very complex.

4
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:25,080
We'll keep it simple in this section so that the basics of inheritance and C++ are clear and you can

5
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:29,130
have the foundation to study more advanced concepts in more advanced courses.

6
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:32,730
First we'll look at what inheritance is and why it's so useful.

7
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:37,980
Think re-usability and then we'll discuss some of the terminology and notations used when talking about

8
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:38,940
inheritance.

9
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:45,030
Aggregation is also a re-usability mechanism and we'll see the difference between inheritance and aggregation.

10
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:50,700
Since many times we can use aggregation instead of inheritance to achieve what we want and avoid unnecessary

11
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:51,930
complexity.

12
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:57,870
Then we'll get into the syntax of inheritance in C++ or learn how to derive one class from an existing

13
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:03,190
class and discuss the three types of inheritance provided by C++.

14
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:09,330
You may recall when we talked about the public and private class access modifiers in Section 13 I mentioned

15
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:12,510
that there was a third type of access modifier named protected.

16
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:17,930
Well protected is used in the context of inheritance and we will see how it can be useful in that context

17
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:19,740
in this section.

18
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:24,540
Then we'll look at constructors and destructors and see how they work when we've got inheritance hierarchies

19
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:25,790
with inheritance.

20
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:31,200
We can create new classes that modify the behavior of their parent classes so we'll see how that works

21
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:33,030
and how it can be useful.

22
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:38,720
Finally we'll talk about what class hierarchies are and we'll do a short introduction to multiple inheritance.

23
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:43,890
Once we understand the basics of inheritance in this section the next section will really open up the

24
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:45,350
power of C++.

25
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,090
When we talk about polymorphism when it's used with inheritance and polymorphic methods.

26
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:53,570
So let's head to the next video and see what inheritance is all about.
