Module Summary.

2
00:00:01,231 --> 00:00:06,154
You have learned that Agile does have process,

3
00:00:06,154 --> 00:00:08,000
documentation, requirements gathering,

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,400
and follows a plan; not like the myths or naysayers suggest.

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:18,000
The essence of Agile is to constantly adapt and re-plan your work

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and activities throughout the project lifecycle.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
You learn how you must 'break up' your requirements gathering

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
process into multiple requirements gathering iterations to

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,500
adapt to an Agile-type project.

10
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,000
Managing a product backlog with priorities and

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,154
estimates is critical for each release.

12
00:00:38,154 --> 00:00:43,000
Users and customers will not likely easily embrace Agile.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,824
Users want budget predictability, a project end date,

14
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:51,286
and hence, you may need executive sponsorship for a greater chance of adoption.

15
00:00:51,286 --> 00:00:51,857
Lastly,

16
00:00:51,857 --> 00:01:01,000
effective collaboration with all participants will foster trust and therefore enable honest feedback and increasing motivation for all.
