00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.625
What is a Project Definition Document?

2
00:00:03.625 --> 00:00:08.500
It provides the necessary project guidance, so don't leave home without it.

3
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.000
If you are in the requirements gathering business I would

4
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.263
like to suggest to you that you must have a Project

5
00:00:14.263 --> 00:00:15.947
Definition Template or document.

6
00:00:15.947 --> 00:00:21.000
It is a must have to establish key elements of your project.

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.375
The project definition is a statement of the scope,

8
00:00:24.375 --> 00:00:28.714
objectives, and participants you must collect to establish your initial scope,

9
00:00:28.714 --> 00:00:30.000
and more importantly,

10
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.667
you must understand and define your customers' expectations.

11
00:00:33.667 --> 00:00:41.000
Remember, always keep the focus on the customer and their expectations.

12
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.053
Gather the right amount of information for the level of effort.

13
00:00:45.053 --> 00:00:48.300
So what is the right information you should collect?

14
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.200
Well, it depends.

15
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.400
It needs to be the right amount and let's see what that is by

16
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:58.000
reviewing the Project Definition Template.

17
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
The Project Definition Template is composed of a checklist of attributes.

18
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.571
This is just a starter list.

19
00:01:04.571 --> 00:01:08.000
So what is in a Project Definition Template?

20
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.316
Purpose.

21
00:01:08.316 --> 00:01:10.526
What is the purpose of this project?

22
00:01:10.526 --> 00:01:14.500
Remember earlier, we need to know this to determine the end result.

23
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.000
Goals and objectives.

24
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Here you would write a more detailed list of goals or objectives.

25
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.462
These are written in the user terms or vocabulary.

26
00:01:25.462 --> 00:01:27.000
No techy talk here.

27
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.875
Success criteria.

28
00:01:27.875 --> 00:01:30.938
What determines the success of the project?

29
00:01:30.938 --> 00:01:36.500
List the items that must be completed, including schedule if you can,

30
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.000
and the budget.

31
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
What's out of scope?

32
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.579
List the items you will not implement.

33
00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:47.000
This is important as projects progress, as we need to track this.

34
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.294
Assumptions.

35
00:01:47.294 --> 00:01:47.882
For example,

36
00:01:47.882 --> 00:01:50.824
the new system must be implemented after a particular date

37
00:01:50.824 --> 00:01:54.182
or before a new customer comes on board.

38
00:01:54.182 --> 00:01:55.818
Return on investment.

39
00:01:55.818 --> 00:01:58.000
Is this project worthwhile?

40
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.800
Will it increase revenue?

41
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.600
Will it decrease costs?

42
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.000
Recommended approach.

43
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Detail the approach this project will take.

44
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
It might include technology or project organization.

45
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.909
Business drivers.

46
00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:16.000
Key business drivers that give viability to this project.

47
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000
These are critical and we use to validate project decisions in the future.

48
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.778
Constraints.

49
00:02:21.778 --> 00:02:28.000
These may be resource, schedule, people, budget, etc.

50
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.333
Risks.

51
00:02:28.333 --> 00:02:31.333
What risks are possible if you do the project?

52
00:02:31.333 --> 00:02:34.000
For example, this project may affect other projects.

53
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.444
What are the risks if you don't do this project?

54
00:02:38.444 --> 00:02:38.889
Stakeholders.

55
00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:42.538
The users, the management team, the steering committee,

56
00:02:42.538 --> 00:02:49.000
vendors or suppliers, list everyone that may be involved in the project.

57
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.143
Preliminary cost and schedule.

58
00:02:50.143 --> 00:02:53.000
Rough out what you think this may take to do.

59
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.000
You might want to do this last after you have gathered more requirements.

60
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Preliminary resource estimates.

61
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
This is what resources you need for the project.

62
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.429
These could be people in your company, consultants,

63
00:03:06.429 --> 00:03:09.000
dollars, equipment, and things like that.

64
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.286
Policies and standards.

65
00:03:10.286 --> 00:03:15.000
What, if any, company policies and standards are driving this project?

66
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.250
Legal and regulatory.

67
00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.000
What legal or regulatory items are driving this project?

68
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.750
Just HIPPA for example.

69
00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:22.625
Competitor drivers.

70
00:03:22.625 --> 00:03:26.563
What are your competitors doing that drives some of

71
00:03:26.563 --> 00:03:28.800
the requirements for this project?

72
00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.500
This is only a partial list.

73
00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:37.000
Improve on it and add to it with each new project.

74
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.200
Structure and 'Right' Level of Effort.

75
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.000
Project Definition Template Structure.

76
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.118
This is your checklist of the superset of all possible

77
00:03:48.118 --> 00:03:51.000
attributes you may need for any project.

78
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.421
Let's keep it simple and put them all in an MS/Word document.

79
00:03:55.421 --> 00:03:58.000
How large or complex is this project?

80
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.353
Not every item in your Project Definition Template would be

81
00:04:00.353 --> 00:04:02.000
appropriate or need to be filled out.

82
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.941
So balance the need for rigor and detail in contrast to the

83
00:04:06.941 --> 00:04:09.000
requirement for speed and efficiency.

84
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.111
Let's talk about the right level of effort.

85
00:04:12.111 --> 00:04:16.000
Address each checklist item that is relevant for your project.

86
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.750
Do not remove items from your project document just mark them as does not apply,

87
00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.333
in the case they are relevant downstream in the process.

88
00:04:23.333 --> 00:04:28.406
Your Project Definition Template should grow and improve with each project.

89
00:04:28.406 --> 00:04:32.063
With each new project you will discover additional items

90
00:04:32.063 --> 00:04:38.000
or more elaboration on existing items. Always update and improve your template.
