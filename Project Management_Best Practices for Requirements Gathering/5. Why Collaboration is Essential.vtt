1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.500
Educate and Support Your Agile End Users.

2
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:08.000
Find ways to give users some sense of predictability.

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
That's why I like to do a high-level estimate of the entire feature set.

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.286
Earn trust incrementally.

5
00:00:13.286 --> 00:00:18.000
It may take a few iterations or releases to do this.

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Explain how updates will become more accurate as the project progresses.

7
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.750
All team members will learn more about the business domain

8
00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.000
and the software tools and processes.

9
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Give users enough information to make good decisions; priorities of features,

10
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.692
value to business, quality estimates.

11
00:00:37.692 --> 00:00:42.000
Make sure you talk to all the stakeholders.

12
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Don't use developer buzzwords.

13
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Adopt Agile techniques gradually.

14
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.667
Effective Collaboration is an essential cornerstone of all Agile methodologies,

15
00:00:52.667 --> 00:00:58.000
and you need to eat and breathe it in your projects.

16
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Your role in performing requirements gathering is extremely 'people oriented'.

17
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.733
An effective collaboration with your customers is essential.

18
00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:11.059
You are not a software engineer-you are a business analyst

19
00:01:11.059 --> 00:01:13.176
focused on your customer's business needs.

20
00:01:13.176 --> 00:01:18.118
You will be more successful if you always keep this in mind.

21
00:01:18.118 --> 00:01:21.294
Three tips to support successful collaboration,

22
00:01:21.294 --> 00:01:25.000
whether using an Agile methodology or not.

23
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.

24
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
As a business analyst, you are the glue holding these groups together.

25
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Projects need to be built around motivated individuals.

26
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Give them the environment and support they need,

27
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.111
and trust them to get the job done.

28
00:01:43.111 --> 00:01:43.500
Thirdly,

29
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.556
the most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and

30
00:01:48.556 --> 00:01:54.000
within a development team is face-to-face conversation.

31
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Think twice when sending yet another dry and flat email message.

32
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.727
Key Collaboration Factors.

33
00:02:01.727 --> 00:02:07.182
Three key factors enhancing collaboration are,

34
00:02:07.182 --> 00:02:13.765
first: Feedback: An Agile process allows for feedback on several levels.

35
00:02:13.765 --> 00:02:20.000
Daily work through stand up and status, iterations, releases, project wrap ups.

36
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Your feedback needs to contain a clear purpose as well,

37
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.333
and is specific and descriptive.

38
00:02:28.333 --> 00:02:31.000
Also offer positive alternatives.

39
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.556
Secondly,

40
00:02:31.556 --> 00:02:36.667
Communication: Now it is important to deliver information in a

41
00:02:36.667 --> 00:02:39.000
manner that is understood by the receiver.

42
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.053
Eliminate all the 'techie' talk; I hear this time and again,

43
00:02:43.053 --> 00:02:46.000
end users and executives just do not care.

44
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.500
Know your audience, use their terminology.

45
00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:57.455
Lastly, Motivation: Is built on encouragement, partnership, and compromise.

46
00:02:57.455 --> 00:03:04.000
Create an environment of trust, partnership, and self-directedness.

47
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.063
There's Only One Way to do Agile.

48
00:03:07.063 --> 00:03:07.938
Absolutely not!

49
00:03:07.938 --> 00:03:11.000
If you've heard this, it is false.

50
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.500
Agile consists of values and principles.

51
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.000
It does not document implementation details.

52
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.714
Sample Agile implementations that you may have heard of are SCRUM,

53
00:03:22.714 --> 00:03:25.059
Extreme Programming, Kanban, Feature Driven Development,

54
00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:25.765
and others.

55
00:03:25.765 --> 00:03:30.000
As long as you are adhering to the Agile values and principles,

56
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.500
you should be considered agile.

57
00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:33.000
Therefore,

58
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.667
it is ok to 'roll your own' implementation that works for

59
00:03:38.667 --> 00:03:42.000
you and your organization; be agile.

60
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:49.000
Leverage as many best practices of Agile as you can-adoption may vary and take time.
