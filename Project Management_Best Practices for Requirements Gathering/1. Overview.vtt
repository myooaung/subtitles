Requirements Gathering in an Agile Environment.

20
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
In the first module we learned about the fundamentals of requirements gathering.

21
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.200
In the second module we learned about several practical

22
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.000
tools to help you gather requirements.

23
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.333
In this module,

24
00:01:30.333 --> 00:01:34.333
we will provide some context in how requirements gathering

25
00:01:34.333 --> 00:01:37.000
can work within an Agile environment.

26
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.333
Every environment is different-with several 'shades of

27
00:01:39.333 --> 00:01:44.692
gray' as to how agile they might be, maybe not agile at all.

28
00:01:44.692 --> 00:01:49.000
We will explore some requirements gathering techniques that

29
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:56.000
can assist you regardless of the amount of agility that may exist in your environment.
