1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,750
Practical Tools-Business Rules.

2
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:07,000
Continuously document your Business Rules as you attain them.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,143
As we mentioned, Prototype, Wireframe,

4
00:00:09,143 --> 00:00:12,143
and Mockup workshops greatly enhance your knowledge

5
00:00:12,143 --> 00:00:14,250
and understanding of Business Rules.

6
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:18,000
Create a document template for a screen's Business Rules.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,235
This'll be comprised of screen name, screen purpose,

8
00:00:22,235 --> 00:00:25,941
references to User Stories or Use Cases,

9
00:00:25,941 --> 00:00:28,167
screenshot of your Mockup,

10
00:00:28,167 --> 00:00:34,000
description of each and every element on the screen Mockup.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
So, let's look at a graphic on the next slide.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,105
Practical Tools-Business Rules, Part 2.

13
00:00:39,105 --> 00:00:40,368
As an example,

14
00:00:40,368 --> 00:00:45,750
you can use a word processor and get a screenshot of the

15
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:51,000
screen and paste it into your document.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,059
Practical Tools-Business Rules, Part 3.

17
00:00:53,059 --> 00:00:58,000
This is a very simple model that you can certainly improve on.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Build a table as follows: Column for the control name,

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,684
a column for the control type, a third column for behavior and Business Rules.

20
00:01:11,684 --> 00:01:16,316
Each control type has its own mini template to fill out,

21
00:01:16,316 --> 00:01:20,077
one for text boxes, drop-down lists, grids,

22
00:01:20,077 --> 00:01:21,462
et cetera.

23
00:01:21,462 --> 00:01:27,000
This greatly enhances requirements understanding and data mapping.

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,636
Practical Tools-Data Modeling.

25
00:01:28,636 --> 00:01:32,455
Continuously document your Data Model throughout your

26
00:01:32,455 --> 00:01:34,385
requirements gathering life cycle.

27
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:36,231
Prototype, Wireframe, Mockup workshops,

28
00:01:36,231 --> 00:01:39,750
and writing the Business Rules greatly enhance your

29
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:42,375
knowledge and understanding of the Data Model.

30
00:01:42,375 --> 00:01:47,143
Create a visual representation of your data model like the one below.

31
00:01:47,143 --> 00:01:51,000
This greatly enhances your understanding of the Data Model.

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,067
Delivering Requirements.

33
00:01:52,067 --> 00:01:59,000
So, how do you deliver your requirements that you gathered to the customer?

34
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,938
Remember your stakeholders?

35
00:01:59,938 --> 00:02:02,750
Each stakeholder will have different needs and should see

36
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:06,154
different views of the results of your requirements.

37
00:02:06,154 --> 00:02:11,000
The product owner stakeholder receives the product definition document,

38
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,214
Prototypes, Wireframes, Mockups, Business Rules,

39
00:02:14,214 --> 00:02:21,615
Data Model, probably not, but maybe, priority list of features and estimates.

40
00:02:21,615 --> 00:02:27,000
A financial or senior management may receive product definition document,

41
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,400
plans and schedules, budgets, and resources.

42
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,200
And, remember,

43
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:39,000
you may have several other stakeholder types that may receive different parts of your requirements gathering documents.
