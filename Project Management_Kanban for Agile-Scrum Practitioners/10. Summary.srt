00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:05,680
Here are the key points of this module to hold near and dear to your heart.

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,470
The kanban approach is to deliver value to our

3
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:11,330
stakeholders efficiently and with quality.

4
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:15,460
Kanban enables greater predictability by constraining work in progress.

5
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:15,810
Remember,

6
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:19,990
this helps manage disorder. By limiting work in progress, your team can

7
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:23,320
react more quickly and thus prevent issues from building up.

8
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,410
Demand is pulled, not pushed,

9
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:28,920
and therefore that is why kanban is known as a pull system.

10
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,030
Limiting work in progress also constrains your team size,

11
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:36,620
therefore your cost, and reduces your lead time, the time it

12
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,600
takes to go through your value stream.

13
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:51,000
Lastly, shorter lead times benefits quality, agility, and customer satisfaction. Coming up next is Transitioning from Waterfall to Kanban.
