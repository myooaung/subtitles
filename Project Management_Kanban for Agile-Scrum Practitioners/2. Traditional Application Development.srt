00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:06,340
Now let's talk about waterfall and traditional development.

2
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:07,900
Here's what I mean by waterfall.

3
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:10,850
Waterfall is the practice or approach from writing

4
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:14,650
specifications through customer delivery over a sequence

5
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:19,840
of milestones that can cover months, if not years.

6
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,230
Let's talk about a typical traditional waterfall process.

7
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:27,730
The waterfall model illustrates the software development process in a linear,

8
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:31,520
sequential flow. The waterfall model is one of the earliest software

9
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:35,540
development lifecycle approaches that was used for software development. This

10
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:40,320
means that any phase in a development process begins only if the previous

11
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,180
phase is complete. As you can see, requirements must be done,

12
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:49,040
signed off, approved, budgeted, and so on before design begins.

13
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:55,610
As you know, herein lies the key flaw of waterfall, a sequential serial process.

14
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:56,310
Lastly,

15
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:59,560
the time to get from requirements to maintenance, that is the lead

16
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:04,940
time, is just too long in today's business world.

17
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:07,770
Also, in order to implement a waterfall project,

18
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:11,240
there's also the need to have a project management methodology driving

19
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:14,730
the project forward. With traditional development projects, we had

20
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:17,950
five process groups, initiation, planning,

21
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:20,460
execution, performance and monitoring,

22
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:24,490
and lastly, closure. The waterfall development approach works hand in hand

23
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:27,500
with this traditional project management methodology.

24
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:30,950
I spent much of my early career using various forms of waterfall.

25
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:31,770
Let's face it,

26
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:35,490
it is natural to try and understand the requirements before you write code,

27
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:36,210
of course,

28
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:39,080
but do you need to know all of the requirements to the

29
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:41,320
nth degree before you write code?

30
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,640
I say no.

31
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:52,000
So, kanban is not only a potential replacement for waterfall, but also for many of the traditional project management methods as well.
