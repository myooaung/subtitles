00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:05.730
This section will be on obtaining acceptance of management and your teammates.

2
00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.140
Let's discuss some ideas on how to make this happen.

3
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:13.360
What makes people resistant to change is risk.

4
00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.640
There are always risks with change,

5
00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.030
and here are some ideas on how to deal with those.

6
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.520
I will first mention a potential risk and then

7
00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.320
approaches to alleviate or remove the risk.

8
00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.870
First, disrupting current processes.

9
00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:29.210
You are developing software in a new way, so it may be disruptive.

10
00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:34.710
So the way to start would be to slowly adopt and adapt at a project boundary or,

11
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.240
say, a major system release milestone.

12
00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.210
Do not adopt Kanban midstream in a large project.

13
00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.340
Some members may likely be slow to adopt or be resistant to change.

14
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.230
That is actually understandable.

15
00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.740
Get initial buy‑in for a period of time,

16
00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.980
maybe about three months or so, since it may take time to learn,

17
00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.240
feel comfortable, and see the results.

18
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.590
Team members may feel insecure and uneasy,

19
00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.190
which is totally normal, so help mitigate this by spending time to educate,

20
00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.000
train, and coach others.

21
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.670
There will be a loss of initial productivity.

22
00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:06.480
That's a given.

23
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.330
You are learning a whole new way to develop software,

24
00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.870
so do not oversell Kanban as a cure‑all for everything.

25
00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:17.140
So set expectations with management, your teammates, and your customer.

26
00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.630
And let's not forget you. Set personal expectations as a

27
00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.740
team leader, and don't over‑extend.

28
00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.720
You will not be able to prove to management that using Kanban or

29
00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.180
enhancing your use of Kanban without metrics. Put in place tracking tools

30
00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.860
and processes. More on that later in this module.

31
00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.050
This will also provide the positive feedback to not only managers but teammates

32
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.930
to see if this is really working or not and where to fix it.

33
00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:42.960
Inadequate communication and training.

34
00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.490
You need a focused communication plan to present to management and

35
00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.060
possibly your customers and your team members as well.

36
00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.690
All right, understand your risks so you can best position

37
00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.640
your plans to gain acceptance and support.

38
00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.690
Here are some ideas to help you work through the

39
00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.920
challenges of getting management approval.

40
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.640
First, businesses are run by business people.

41
00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.160
They may not mind or care in how you do your job so long

42
00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.490
as business is affected positively.

43
00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:15.250
Fiduciary responsibility is imperative and is a prime obligation of their job.

44
00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.420
It is very likely that you will need management approval to proceed,

45
00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.240
adopt, or grow Kanban, and,

46
00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.300
if not, great! Start moving forward. Many times managers see change as

47
00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.180
a risk to the operations of their responsibility.

48
00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.930
I think this is correct and justifiable.

49
00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.080
That is their job.

50
00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.590
If the software development process you are using now

51
00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.930
is working, then why make a change?

52
00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.440
Wouldn't that be risky?

53
00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.640
They may certainly ask that question,

54
00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.770
and they will expect you to know why Kanban will be better. If your

55
00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:47.260
development process is having troubles and the bugs are growing and you

56
00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.870
are not meeting the customer's needs, actually,

57
00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.810
you may have an easier sell to get your manager to agree with a new approach,

58
00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.630
since what would they have to lose anyway?

59
00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:02.140
Nonetheless, they will expect you to know why Kanban will be better.

60
00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.430
Now let's look at some ideas on how best to prepare management.

61
00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.660
What does management like more than anything? Faster,

62
00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.540
better, and cheaper, right?

63
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.240
You want to show how you can provide greater value to their

64
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.840
customers faster and with more quality.

65
00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.510
There is always room for improvement.

66
00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.680
No matter how good you think you're doing something,

67
00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.240
there're always opportunities for making things better.

68
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.970
So even if your current processes are working well,

69
00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.340
it may be that Kanban could even improve on that even more.

70
00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.380
Develop a plan to educate management on the benefits of

71
00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.560
implementing Kanban. Secure approval from management.

72
00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.400
You will need it.

73
00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.560
Proactive managers and leaders are looking for new ways to improve the business.

74
00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.980
They may look to you as a change agent,

75
00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.040
and this could be a great opportunity for your career as well.

76
00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.620
You will have a greater chance of successfully

77
00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.180
implementing Kanban with management's approval since

78
00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.590
you'll want their skin in the game as well.

79
00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.840
Now let's see just how you might get the approvals you need.

80
00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.400
Now let's see how you would convince your management by

81
00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.570
appealing to the business benefits of using Kanban.

82
00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:06.590
Plan your presentation to influence management.

83
00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.240
Management loves to see process improvements,

84
00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.010
better quality delivered, and more throughput.

85
00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.340
Focus your approach and presentation on adding value to the business.

86
00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:20.500
Understand their hot buttons. What are they? Figure them out before

87
00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.320
you present. Are new requirements just taking too long to implement?

88
00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.400
Can priority changes be handled better?

89
00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.900
Can we respond more quickly to new or dynamically changing priorities?

90
00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.500
Do we have too much rework?

91
00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.110
That's just wasting time and resources. What takes so long to

92
00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.650
get our features implemented? These are questions and

93
00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:40.710
challenges facing management today,

94
00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.440
so you need to clearly lay out how Kanban will

95
00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.140
support and mitigate their concerns.

96
00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:49.640
Now let's look at some ideas.

97
00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.200
Here are some questions management may ask and what your

98
00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.170
answers may be. How many meetings will you have?

99
00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:58.790
Daily standups and only occasional meetings as needed. Also,

100
00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:00.410
no special process meetings.

101
00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:02.330
How long does it take to correct issues?

102
00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.680
Well, visual workflow identifies issues,

103
00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.860
and the team can more readily resolve it.

104
00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.040
Is it possible to submit incomplete work?

105
00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.740
Well, because of the 'done' rule, incomplete work cannot be submitted.

106
00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.270
Is there a lot of rework?

107
00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:17.930
There is a reduction of rework since there are clear quality‑assurance

108
00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:22.150
steps throughout the workflow process. Could schedules slip? Well, by

109
00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:29.000
minimizing work in progress, new priorities can be accommodated, and more deliveries can be on time.
