00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:01,980
In this section,

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:08,440
we will discuss the Agile/Scrum events and how they map and compare with Kanban.

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:12,200
Let's compare the Agile/Scrum project planning event with Kanban. With

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:15,100
Scrum, the backlog is created by the product owners.

5
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:19,140
This happens at project initiation at each release and at each

6
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,510
sprint planning meeting. With Kanban, the backlog is created

7
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:23,940
by the product owners as well,

8
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:27,510
and this happens once at project initiation and updated as

9
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:31,540
needed throughout the entire project.

10
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:34,230
Let's compare the Agile/Scrum sprint planning event with

11
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:37,560
Kanban. With Scrum, the product owner prioritizes and

12
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,950
selects backlog items for each sprint.

13
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:43,070
This happens during sprint planning, about every 2 to 3 weeks,

14
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:46,050
depending on the length of your sprint. With Kanban, items are

15
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:48,100
pulled from the backlog in the order needed.

16
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:50,510
The product owner or customer still provides inputs,

17
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:51,140
of course,

18
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:54,570
and this happens in no particular frequency, but may be reviewed

19
00:00:54,570 --> 00:01:00,240
daily and is not tied to any 2 or 3 week event.

20
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,330
Let's compare the Agile/Scrum daily standup event with

21
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:07,290
Kanban. With Scrum, in the standup, you discuss what you have done,

22
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:10,030
what you plan to do, and if you have any blockers,

23
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:11,490
those are discussed as well.

24
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:14,060
This happens daily. With Kanban during the daily

25
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:15,990
standups, the board is reviewed,

26
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:19,020
and you'll mostly focus on discussing blockers that

27
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,040
are impeding the flow of work.

28
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,310
You see, the board itself reveals what is being worked by each person,

29
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:27,990
so discussing what you did and what you plan to do may

30
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:30,390
be redundant and a waste of time.

31
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:34,320
Everything is on the board. Now, you do this in no particular

32
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,940
frequency, but usually is reviewed daily.

33
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:42,220
Let's compare the sprint demonstration/review event with Kanban.

34
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:46,200
With Scrum, you demo and discuss the working software demonstrated

35
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,930
to the users to get their feedback.

36
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:49,790
This happens at the end of each sprint,

37
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:52,930
about every 2 to 3 weeks. With Kanban, customers see

38
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:54,740
the working software as delivered.

39
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:58,680
No reason to wait for a special event, and no particular frequency,

40
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:04,670
either, but usually daily. Let's compare the sprint retrospective event

41
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:08,490
with Kanban. With Scrum, process improvements are reviewed and discussed

42
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:10,480
as a team during the retro event.

43
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:13,980
This happens at the end of each sprint, about every 2 to 3 weeks. With

44
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:18,030
Kanban, process issues are discussed and corrected as encountered; no

45
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:20,290
particular frequency, but maybe daily,

46
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:28,000
so no better time than the present to discuss process issues when they are discovered, and no extra event required.
