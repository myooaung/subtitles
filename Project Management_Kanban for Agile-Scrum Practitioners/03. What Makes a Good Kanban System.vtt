00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.870
So what makes a good kanban system? First,

2
00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:09.060
kanban systems must limit a team's work in progress to a set

3
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:13.160
capacity of resources, so each work step will have a capacity of

4
00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.150
people working that step. And secondly,

5
00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.300
they must have a signaling event to trigger pulling

6
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.500
new work forward through the system.

7
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.320
The signaling event is the fact that the completion

8
00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.910
criteria for that step has been fulfilled.

9
00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.250
Now let's take a deeper look at how waterfall and

10
00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.540
agile set limits to work in progress.

11
00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.920
It might sound a bit strange to be saying this. With kanban,

12
00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.520
we set limits on what we're going to do,

13
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.760
and this is so important to a well oiled and healthy kanban

14
00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.950
activity. For perspective, with waterfall,

15
00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:54.340
we in effect set limits by defining all the requirements and milestones upfront,

16
00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.840
then develop and then deploy.

17
00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.650
We added a change management system to manage any

18
00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.040
unexpected requirements or issues.

19
00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.960
This helped in keeping things running as smooth as possible and reduced

20
00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:11.150
disorder. With Scrum, we limited disorder by planning sprints in two or

21
00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.420
three week time boxes, while at the same time reserving any changes

22
00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.380
until the next sprint planning meeting when we reâ€‘synced with the

23
00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.050
customer. With kanban, this order is controlled by limiting the amount

24
00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:25.550
of work in progress,

25
00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:31.420
which with kanban is the number of cards allowed at each step to be worked.

26
00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.130
Though this may sound like Scrum, the time intervals are vastly different.

27
00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.510
Scrum's time box is about 2 to 3 weeks, and with kanban, well,

28
00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.100
there is no time box.

29
00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.090
We are setting the stage here. And later in this course, we have a

30
00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:51.740
module focused on setting limits and managing workloads.

31
00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.450
So here are the main core kanban properties at all

32
00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.040
good kanban systems must embody.

33
00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.240
Visualize your workflow, your value stream with a kanban board.

34
00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:08.070
Limit the work in progress by each resource working on one work item at a time.

35
00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:12.690
Measure and manage the workflow, which will help you predict your work outcomes.

36
00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.290
Make process policies explicit.

37
00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.410
This will generally relate to the completion criteria

38
00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.050
for each step in your value stream.

39
00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.360
Use models to recognize improvement opportunities to

40
00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.840
further enhance your value stream.

41
00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:33.000
We will be getting into much more detail on these kanban properties throughout the course.
