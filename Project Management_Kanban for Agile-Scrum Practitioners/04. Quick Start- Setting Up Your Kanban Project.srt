00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:06,970
Now let's begin setting up a kanban project. First,

2
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:11,080
let's define what a value stream is. It's the workflow that

3
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:15,080
takes you from value demand, something is required or wanted,

4
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,760
to value delivery, the requirement is satisfied. And you're

5
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:25,040
doing this by minimizing time, effort, and cost.

6
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,860
Here is an example of a simple value stream.

7
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:32,640
Specify the work that is necessary to implement. Then implement the work.

8
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,590
Next, validate that it works properly against the

9
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:40,960
specification or expected outcomes, as defined in the specify step. And lastly,

10
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,560
deliver it to your customers.

11
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:46,640
Very simple, very straightforward.

12
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,860
Here are some rules of thumb, or guidelines, when defining the value stream.

13
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:55,260
Now the previous example was very simple, and yours could be much more complex.

14
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:56,560
You may have, for example,

15
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:00,350
multiple steps and variations to implement or validate a work item.

16
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:00,760
Okay,

17
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,900
here they are. Only include the steps your team is responsible

18
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:08,090
for. Leave out any steps that occur before your value stream

19
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:11,340
begins and after your value stream ends.

20
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,460
If you are not sure what steps to start with,

21
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:13,960
well,

22
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:17,750
just start with the ones on the previous slide. Combine steps if they

23
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:20,750
are sequential and will be done by the same resource.

24
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:21,750
If, for example,

25
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:26,360
a developer writes unit tests, codes, and does user acceptance testing,

26
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:31,020
maybe all those are contained in the implement step. Hmm, you say, but what

27
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,390
if my team members don't have all the same skills,

28
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:35,240
technical, or business knowledge?

29
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:41,000
Great question. You're catching on. More on that later in this course.
