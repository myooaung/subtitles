00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:02,270
Hello, and welcome.

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:04,430
I'm Michael Krasowski from Pluralsight.

3
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:06,880
I will be presenting the module, What You Will Learn,

4
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:12,240
in the course, Kanban for Agile/Scrum Practitioners.

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,540
Think you haven't used Kanban?

6
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:14,880
Well, think again.

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,960
If you've been to a typical coffee house,

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,190
you've experienced the following: Someone takes your order and

9
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:22,350
marks your cup for the kind of coffee you want,

10
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:24,980
how much room at the top for cream you want,

11
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:27,480
and the temperature, and maybe even other things.

12
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,220
The cup is placed in a queue.

13
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:32,940
The barista will pick up the cup, read the cup, and make the coffee.

14
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:34,960
The finished cup is placed on a shelf.

15
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,860
The store is using kanban to speed your order through.

16
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:40,840
And guess what that coffee cup is?

17
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:46,120
Well, besides holding your favorite cup of joe, it is acting as a kanban card.

18
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:50,540
Well, more on cards in the next module.

19
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:53,230
Let me start by telling you what kanban isn't.

20
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:56,720
It is not a software development lifecycle methodology.

21
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,800
It is not a project management methodology.

22
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,580
Yet, kanban improves developing software and managing projects.

23
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:05,110
Okay, I'm intrigued.

24
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:08,180
So what is it?

25
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:14,140
Kanban is a framework to allow you to create contextâ€‘specific process solutions.

26
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:18,680
Kanban does not follow a rigid software development lifecycle process.

27
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,810
So if you walked around a company or multiple companies that

28
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:24,360
practice kanban and you looked at each board,

29
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,140
each one would be different, look different,

30
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:31,370
with different cards, different colors, different columns and steps,

31
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:33,580
yet all running smoothly.

32
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:38,000
Are you still intrigued? Then this course is for you.
