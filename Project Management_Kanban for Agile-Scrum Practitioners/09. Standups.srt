00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:07,140
Stand‑ups are different in kanban, and let's see how and why.

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:10,410
Let's compare and contrast between a typical Agile/Scrum

3
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,590
stand‑up and then a kanban stand‑up.

4
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:16,790
First, I'll go over the cadence or pace of the Agile/Scrum stand‑up.

5
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:20,340
The team assembles daily or more at a predefined location.

6
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:23,750
Of course, stand‑ups can happen any time you think you need them for reviews,

7
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:27,290
demos, customer discussions, or how you might improve your processes.

8
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:30,110
Any team member can run or lead a stand‑up.

9
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:33,790
Typically, a round‑robin approach is used. Also, typically,

10
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:36,070
each member states what they accomplished since the last

11
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:38,810
stand‑up, what they plan to accomplish today, and,

12
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:39,540
most importantly,

13
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,590
talk through any of their blockers. Blockers are anything that

14
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:45,270
is impeding their progress, anything at all.

15
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:47,470
Team members may split off afterwards to solve

16
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:49,560
blockers or discuss any other issues.

17
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,940
The person running the stand‑up now asks,

18
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:55,620
anyone need any help? They may last between 5 and 15 minutes,

19
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,420
but if you need a little more time, well,

20
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:01,600
take it. Now, you are likely very familiar with this type of stand‑up.

21
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,190
Now let's take a look at the kanban stand‑up. Now let's

22
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:08,520
review the cadence of a kanban stand‑up.

23
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,800
The team assembles daily, usually in the morning.

24
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,270
This is my preference, but maybe a different routine would work better for you.

25
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:17,670
Now there's no need to go around the room. With a well‑designed

26
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:20,070
board, you can see what people have done,

27
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:22,730
what people are working on, and what is blocked.

28
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:24,920
So why waste time doing that?

29
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,740
The lead or project manager will walk the board,

30
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:29,940
though anyone should be able to do this role.

31
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:32,630
You typically start from the far right of the board

32
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:34,560
and work your way to the left.

33
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,170
The facilitator will be looking for any indicators of issues,

34
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:41,860
validations, and status and generally asking questions of the team.

35
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:48,400
The focus of the stand‑up and of any kanban system is the smooth flow of work.

36
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,560
Don't forget that. All activities,

37
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,970
including the stand‑ups, they are no exception, the emphasis will be

38
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:57,230
to identify and remediate blockers and any defects.

39
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:57,690
Typically,

40
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:01,320
all work items will have color monikers so that it is easy to

41
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,690
identify the type of issue to concentrate on those.

42
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:07,710
Certainly people can meet up and further discuss issues,

43
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:15,000
blockers, or other items after the meeting or any time they are working. Now, let's summarize this module.
