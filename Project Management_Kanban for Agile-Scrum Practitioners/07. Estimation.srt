00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:05,040
Now let's talk about estimation.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:10,500
Here's a quote, "I just love to make estimates." by every engineer I have known.

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,370
Of course, that is not true.

4
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:17,260
Almost everyone I have ever known professionally does not like making estimates.

5
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:20,940
I truly believe though, making estimates has value to the

6
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:25,070
business, but just don't go overboard.

7
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:27,560
Making estimates is certainly challenging.

8
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,820
Backlog items come in all different shapes and sizes, challenge

9
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:34,140
your domain of business knowledge, as well as test your

10
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,780
technical promise. This can be daunting.

11
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:40,350
Customers or your managers will ask how soon will the backlog

12
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:43,230
item that is near and dear to them be completed.

13
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:47,540
Senior management may also ask, when will the next major release be completed?

14
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:51,170
I have customers waiting, so you will feel the pressure. Waterfall,

15
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:52,180
Agile, Scrum,

16
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:57,450
kanban, or any other approach all share the same degree and the same

17
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:04,260
challenges of making quality estimates. Estimation is essential.

18
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,700
Customers want to know,

19
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:09,770
and it is a reasonable expectation because in the real world you may

20
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:12,740
still be faced with deadlines and release dates.

21
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:13,130
Hence,

22
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:16,090
estimating is a valuable tool that not only will address the

23
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:18,340
customers or your manager's questions,

24
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:21,270
but also provide performance feedback to the team.

25
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:24,200
So let's decompose work items into tasks.

26
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,510
The time needed to complete tasks is easier to do and

27
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:30,740
likely more predictable than a larger, chunkier work item,

28
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:31,840
like a user story.

29
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:39,000
So one backlog card is now going to be multiple tasks that are required to complete the work item.
