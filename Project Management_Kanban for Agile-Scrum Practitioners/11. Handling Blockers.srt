1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:08,440
As we just learned, bottlenecks are not blockers, so let's dig into blockers.

2
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:09,650
Blockers.

3
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:13,380
A blocker is a blocked or impassable work item that

4
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,580
is restricting the flow of work.

5
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:19,640
It is the work item itself.

6
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,610
Here are just a few examples of work item blockers.

7
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:24,510
Clarification of requirements.

8
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:27,740
You are unclear as to what is really meant in the spec,

9
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:30,730
and you need it to be clarified, and the subject matter expert

10
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:33,440
is not available, so the work is blocked.

11
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,250
Company policy change. Since the time you specified the

12
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:38,240
work and when you actually did the work,

13
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:40,040
the company policy changed.

14
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,070
Now you need to discuss the issue back with the product owner,

15
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:47,030
the customer or maybe even senior management, so the work is blocked.

16
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:48,250
Laws and regulations.

17
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:50,000
Things change fast, for example,

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,310
in the health care industry, and you are at an impasse in how to

19
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:55,480
handle a work item, so the work is blocked.

20
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,130
The business owner is unavailable.

21
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:59,740
This one might be somewhat common, unfortunately,

22
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:02,090
and you need her guidance before proceeding.

23
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:03,540
Your work is blocked.

24
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:04,990
How about someone on vacation?

25
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:05,650
Well,

26
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:09,640
no, that situation is not a blocker, that is just further

27
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:12,050
limiting your work in progress from, say,

28
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:13,920
12 resources to 11.

29
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,130
No work item itself is blocked.

30
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:21,730
You have just fewer resources to perform the work. You want

31
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:25,130
to easily recognize which work items are blockers so you can

32
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:26,650
focus your attention on them.

33
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:29,560
Therefore, visually identify your blockers.

34
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:33,010
Mark the blocked work item with a special color or visual cue.

35
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:37,230
This way, you can easily see the blocked items and discuss them at each standup.

36
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:40,180
Ensure you track the reason, status progress, and other

37
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:43,140
pertinent information for each blocked work item.

38
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:44,090
For example,

39
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:47,030
reason, the algorithm to determine if multiâ€‘tendered

40
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:49,370
transactions should be allowed is not clear,

41
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:54,740
and the subject matter expert, Mary, must be consulted.

42
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:58,690
Blockers are not bottlenecks, and bottlenecks are not blockers.

43
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:01,800
A blocker is an individual work item that is stuck

44
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:06,070
and cannot be worked any further, and we previously gave you several examples.

45
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:08,620
A bottleneck is an issue with capacity,

46
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:11,590
and you have a buffer filling up with too much completed

47
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,740
work and you can't work it fast enough.

48
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:18,340
What is similar between the two is that they both impede the flow of work,

49
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:22,340
but what each one means is different.

50
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:24,740
Here are some approaches to removing blockers.

51
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:27,070
Blockers are discussed at daily standups,

52
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:30,150
discussing the status of the blocker and any ongoing

53
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,820
actions underway to mitigate the blocker. You must have

54
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,930
strong issue escalation processes.

55
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:39,290
This means you need to know who in management or which stakeholder

56
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:42,810
may need to be consulted for each type of issue, escalation

57
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:45,800
policies clearly defined and documented,

58
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,850
and all members clearly understand them,

59
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:51,280
since not everyone may be available to initiate the escalation.

60
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,210
Escalation policies are jointly agreed to by up or downstream

61
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:58,230
partners or other management and stakeholders.

62
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:01,610
This should go without saying, but track all your blockers.

63
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:07,000
Keep them visible, and in front of you each and every day when you do your standups.
