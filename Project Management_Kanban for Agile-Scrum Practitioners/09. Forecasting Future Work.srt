00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:03,420
Let's talk about forecasting in kanban,

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:06,800
which really means getting good at making estimates We did

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,320
touch on estimation in the module Kanban 201,

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,910
and let's revisit.

5
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:15,270
Forecasting really means estimation.

6
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:18,650
Now it's important that you have the ability to make forecasts to

7
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:20,910
inform your customer when something will be done.

8
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:22,700
They will want to know.

9
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:24,200
Respect your customers.

10
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:28,550
They have milestones, due dates, deadlines, and budgets to worry about.

11
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:32,340
So partner with them for the best mutual results.

12
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:33,640
To provide forecasts,

13
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:37,160
you need to be able develop reasonable estimates in order to maintain a

14
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,170
quality professional relationship with your customers.

15
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:41,770
You don't need to make full‑blown,

16
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:44,120
nitty‑gritty spreadsheet estimates necessarily,

17
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:49,100
but you do need to make reasonable estimates.

18
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,570
Now let's talk about estimation thresholds.

19
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:54,330
First, well, are estimates a waste?

20
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:56,740
There is a school of thought in the kanban and agile

21
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:59,210
world that estimates do not add value.

22
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:00,660
I believe they do.

23
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,370
They help in prioritizing work and in determining

24
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:05,590
if the work is worthwhile to do.

25
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:09,440
And there is a host of other excellent reasons to make estimates as well.

26
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,890
But you don't need to estimate everything, of course.

27
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:15,930
Set a threshold policy that you have agreed to with your customer,

28
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:18,840
something like anything that's roughly 3 weeks or less,

29
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,880
we're just going to put it in the backlog and do it as normal. Now, obviously,

30
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,740
producing the 3‑week value is an estimate in and of itself,

31
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:31,320
but only spend 15 minutes tops on it. Now for larger ones,

32
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,020
say the work is greater than 3 weeks, because it is the

33
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:35,970
right professional thing to do,

34
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,720
you will spend a little more time breaking down the work to

35
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,860
provide more insight for the customer.

36
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:45,140
Now let's see an example on how that might work.

37
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:48,920
Here's an example of estimation thresholds we determined at a client of

38
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:53,480
mine. Less than 3 weeks, add to the backlog, and only spend about 15

39
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:58,010
minutes to determine that estimate. Between 3 and 8 weeks, I'm probably

40
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:01,680
going to spend around 1 or 2 hours. Again, add it to the backlog with

41
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,040
the customer's approval.

42
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,780
With less than 3 weeks, just throw it onto the backlog.

43
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:09,150
If it turns out that that time I spent, the 1 to 2 hours, led me

44
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:11,500
to believe that it was greater than 8 weeks,

45
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:15,330
then I'm going to add work to the backlog as just a specify

46
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:17,260
step only with the customer's approval.

47
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:20,570
In other words, we need to do more work to break down the tasks.

48
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:22,760
This approach saves time making estimates,

49
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,650
but does require a good working relationship with your

50
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:28,200
customer and trust that you can deliver.

51
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:32,440
Okay, let's look at another approach.

52
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,930
Here is an example of a scatter plot,

53
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:38,200
and we will see how we can use it to forecast work types.

54
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:42,780
Each dot corresponds to a single completed task in your kanban board.

55
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,570
The key is at the top of the graph.

56
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:47,120
The color of the dot relates to the work type,

57
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,340
and, in this case, I've chosen three work types, bugs with blue diamonds,

58
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:55,620
normal work with red squares, and hot work as green triangles.

59
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:59,380
The X‑axis is time, and I used days as my time period.

60
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:02,340
The Y‑axis is the number of hours to complete that

61
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:05,150
task through the entire value stream.

62
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:09,530
The height of the dot represents its lead time. The higher the dot,

63
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:12,240
the longer it took for this task to be completed.

64
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,540
So, for example,

65
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:18,690
this bug, this dot, took about 15 hours to complete on April 16th.

66
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:23,870
So if 85% of all bugs took 7 days to complete, we could

67
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,610
probably use that as a forecast measurement,

68
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:30,480
and we could tell our customers that the average bug takes 7 days.

69
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,520
Don't worry about having to make these complex

70
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:40,000
spreadsheets yourself and these complex charts. Many kanban products come with these tools all built in to help you.
