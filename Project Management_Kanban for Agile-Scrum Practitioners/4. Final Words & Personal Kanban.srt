00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:06,970
Here are my final words and closing remarks for this course. You don't

2
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:11,340
need some crack team of high achievers to implement Kanban. A good team

3
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:15,900
with reasonable talent can easily succeed, if you do the following. Use

4
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,380
the right process with good discipline.

5
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:21,160
Be supported by strong management and quality

6
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,700
leadership. That can make all the difference.

7
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:24,400
Think about it.

8
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,430
Why is it that most professional basketball teams have pretty much the same

9
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:32,340
talent, yet why is it that some coaches continually win?

10
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,280
They probably have the right process with good discipline and strong

11
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:41,150
leadership. Wherever your career path may take you,

12
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:44,730
the bottom line is your ability to deliver business value.

13
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:50,440
Do not forget that. It is your biggest asset as a professional.

14
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,370
So what about Personal Kanban?

15
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:53,220
Why not?

16
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:55,260
Are you overwhelmed by home projects?

17
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:59,010
If you need some help staying more in control of your personal backlog,

18
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:00,370
you should consider Kanban.

19
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:03,380
I've been using Personal Kanban for many years.

20
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:05,440
You could get fancy and use a digital board,

21
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,600
but for me, it's just a bunch of stickies on a wall in my house.

22
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,730
To get started, just sit down and think about all the things you

23
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:13,820
need to do and list out your backlog.

24
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:17,060
Maybe one is yard work and another one is to remodel a bedroom.

25
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:19,120
The yard work one seems the right size,

26
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,430
but the remodel one seems overwhelming to me.

27
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:22,810
Okay, what do we do?

28
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:24,590
We decompose it into smaller ones.

29
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:25,600
You get the idea.

30
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,270
There are many benefits for me and I hope for you, too.

31
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:32,680
I can relax, since I know all the things I need to do are listed and organized.

32
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,960
I can easily see them and track them.

33
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,550
I can limit the amount of work either than I am doing, or I can see just

34
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:41,270
where I need to add more capacity, like hire a gardener.

35
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:43,040
I hope this might help simplify your life.

36
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,440
It sure has for me.

37
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,730
Thank you very much for taking my course.

38
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:51,410
I, like you, have been challenged over the years in how

39
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:53,670
best to provide value to the business.

40
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:55,770
I hope and trust that this course has been able to

41
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:57,680
provide you with the essential tools,

42
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,980
methods and approaches, and renewed confidence to help you be more

43
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:05,120
successful in your application and usage of Kanban. And lastly,

44
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:13,000
I hope to see you again in one of my other courses, and I wish you the best in your professional journey, and never stop learning.
