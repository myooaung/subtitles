1
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:03,590
Think visual at all times with Kanban.

2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:06,220
Think about how you could enhance the visual aspects of the

3
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:08,380
board so as to provide more information,

4
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:14,500
but with less clutter to ensure the smooth flow of work. You may want

5
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:18,580
to use as many visual cues as possible to make it very easy to glance

6
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:20,460
at the board and see what's going on.

7
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,110
For example, maybe the color of the card maps to the work type.

8
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:25,200
Here's some examples.

9
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:29,710
Change requests may be green, user stories are orange, suggestions and

10
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:34,210
research blue, bugs and production defects violet, just to name a few;

11
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:37,910
you may have more. And maybe you want to use icons or badges that

12
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:41,230
would be placed on the cards, such as, here's one for bugs,

13
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:44,370
hot production issues, big dollar value, and lastly,

14
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:46,990
maybe an org chart represents a request from senior

15
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:49,740
management, so I assume this may be a high priority.

16
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:53,650
You know your business and your customers, so be creative and be sure

17
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:56,670
whatever you do makes sense to the team, and don't be afraid to

18
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:01,440
change things as you need to along the way.

19
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,160
Here's an example of a board with color and refined swim lanes.

20
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,200
Here's our board.

21
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,330
Here's our backlog.

22
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:11,910
Let's say we want to make it very clear what the priority backlog items are.

23
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:16,750
Here are items in priority one, here are priority two items, and here are

24
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:18,950
priority three items. And the rest, remember,

25
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:21,830
are nice‑to‑haves that we may work on sometimes. Priority

26
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:24,600
one items are very visual and clear.

27
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:29,070
Also, based on our last slide, we see we have one change request, green,

28
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:31,920
one research item, blue, and one bug item,

29
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,100
and that's violet.

30
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:38,920
Learning the visual cues is very simple and easy. Just as

31
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,570
you track the type of work, such as a bug,

32
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:44,920
for example, you may want to track the source of the work type.

33
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,430
In other words, where's it coming from?

34
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:48,620
This may be important as well.

35
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:52,110
For example, the work source may be from the executive suites,

36
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:54,890
from sales and business development, from engineering,

37
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:58,740
maybe even from internal IT, or many other organizations or departments,

38
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,560
maybe even vendors and suppliers.

39
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,110
Now you could also use color. Again, Kanban means you can do whatever

40
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:07,730
you need to do to optimize workflow. But also you could use additional

41
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:13,420
swim lanes, and let's see an example. Now, let's see how the source of

42
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:15,220
the work type may affect the board.

43
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:16,170
Here's our board.

44
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:17,360
Here's our backlog.

45
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,620
Now we want to make it real clear where the source

46
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,430
of our backlog items come from.

47
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:24,590
Here are our items from engineering, and so we use an E.

48
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:27,420
Here are the work items from sales, and we use an S.

49
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:30,180
And here are the executive, or C‑Suite items,

50
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,710
and we will use a C here. And the rest of ours are just

51
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,410
nice‑to‑haves again in the backlog.

52
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:37,980
There are endless ways to lay out your board to meet your needs, so use

53
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:42,570
my examples as ideas only. Please come up with your own that make sense

54
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:47,240
to you and your team and your value stream.

55
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:50,040
Now let's see how we can morph the board to accommodate

56
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,200
setting limits on our work in progress.

57
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,150
Here's our board,

58
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:55,840
and we have widened the three middle columns to

59
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,140
accommodate some additional detail.

60
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:01,300
We will add an additional vertical line to allow for two

61
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,570
vertical buckets for each of our steps.

62
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:08,280
Now let's label them, the first being work in progress, or WIP, and the

63
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,430
second part of the split column, complete, or done.

64
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:12,520
You can see, though,

65
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,300
that the first step, backlog, and the last step,

66
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,290
deliver, do not have two columns.

67
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:19,500
They are not needed necessarily,

68
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,940
since they are the hand‑off areas between upstream work

69
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:25,410
and downstream delivery of the work.

70
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:27,040
Now let's look at a backlog item.

71
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,940
We're going to pull it forward to work in progress and begin working on it.

72
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:31,950
When complete,

73
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:34,970
it is placed in the done area and is basically queued up

74
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:38,170
waiting for a free resource to pull it forward.

75
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:43,020
I do recommend strongly having two columns per workflow step Now,

76
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:45,740
as another way to segment the board, you can see on the right,

77
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:49,530
there will be two areas in the deliver step. One is production

78
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:51,280
stage and one is production.

79
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,910
And maybe that makes perfect sense for your downstream partners.

80
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:57,800
The important point of this slide is that you can be as

81
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,160
flexible as you need or want to be,

82
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:03,260
and once you set it up, be open and willing to change and

83
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:05,940
modify the board as it makes sense. Remember,

84
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:10,300
business is dynamic, and so should your board be. By the way,

85
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:13,630
the done column, in this case, is also known as a buffer,

86
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:18,750
and we'll talk about that more later in this module. You have the

87
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:21,820
freedom to design your board any way you want,

88
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:24,760
as long as it adds value to the business.

89
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:33,000
This is why Kanban has immense power. You are not constrained like some other software development methodologies.
