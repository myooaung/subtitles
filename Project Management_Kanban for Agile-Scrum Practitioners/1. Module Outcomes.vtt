00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:02.250
Hello, and welcome.

2
00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.480
I'm Michael Krasowski from Pluralsight.

3
00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.100
I will be presenting the module, Applying Key Learning Objectives,

4
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:13.440
in the course, Kanban for Agile/Scrum Practitioners.

5
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.200
Well, you made it through the course.

6
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.670
Congratulations! The outcome of this module would be for me to

7
00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:21.960
cover the key points of this course and encourage you to begin

8
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.630
applying what you've learned.

9
00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.940
I won't reiterate things, but instead illuminate topics that

10
00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:31.640
are important and are key takeaways for you.

11
00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.300
Here are the key learning objectives for the module Kanban 201. Kanban

12
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.810
is a pull system because new work or demand is pulled into the system

13
00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:45.500
and is only pulled when there is capacity to work it rather than pushed

14
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.290
into the system like more traditional business workflows. Kanban limits

15
00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:50.300
work in progress.

16
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.840
I keep saying this since in our world today it seems no one limits anything.

17
00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.840
Remember, limiting work reduces cycle time and increases quality of

18
00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.100
work. Visualized workflows, there's no better way to see and

19
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.760
understand what is going on in your value stream.

20
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.910
The workflow that takes you from value demand, something that's

21
00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:13.000
required, to value delivery, the requirement is satisfied by

22
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.240
minimizing waste, time, effort, and cost.

23
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.670
Here are the key learning objectives for the module Transitioning

24
00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.790
from Waterfall Feature teams are likely a new thing if you're

25
00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:26.590
coming from a traditional approach.

26
00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.650
They are a group of individuals working on the same product features together;

27
00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.200
hence, all the talent you need from analysts, developers,

28
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.100
user interface designers, quality assurance, database,

29
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.760
you name it.

30
00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.400
Also, the same team sticks together until the feature is done.

31
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.470
Standups are pretty common today no matter what development methodology you use.

32
00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.090
Standups facilitate cross functional and team discussions.

33
00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.310
One of the main reasons why waterfall had so many issues is

34
00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.490
that it did not have a good facility or structure to promote

35
00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.040
open and honest communication.

36
00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.210
Standups enable a shared visual view of your progress,

37
00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.500
reinforce the value of your work, and provide a sense of belonging to your team.

38
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.260
Something also new with kanban is that work is performed in

39
00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.820
small chunks with work in progress limits,

40
00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:14.290
and we only pull work forward if the work is done based on your done rule

41
00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.050
agreements. Customers can engage at any time and all the time and are engaged

42
00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.030
feature by feature. As needed, the product team members attend to standups to

43
00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.810
clarify requirements and help solve issues, and are therefore engaged

44
00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.380
throughout the entire project. Your team can better react to customer feedback.

45
00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.330
Since work in progress is limited,

46
00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.140
you can more easily adjust to the customer's demands.

47
00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.910
Here are the key learning objectives for the module Transitioning from

48
00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.500
Agile. Time boxing causes artificial constraints on project changes,

49
00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.830
customer feedback, release dates, and any process improvements. Kanban

50
00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.740
removes the artificial sprint time box boundary and the additional

51
00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:59.210
events like retrospectives and reviews while keeping the workflow moving

52
00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:00.600
forward smoothly.

53
00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.310
Kanban can identify and correct workflow issues more quickly.

54
00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.450
All information will be visible and tractable on the board.

55
00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.850
Each step will have two columns, Work in Progress and Done,

56
00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:15.620
including the done rules. With kanban, you explicitly define what done means

57
00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.340
for each step of the value stream, very important to quality.

58
00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.470
Each Work in Progress column will have a limit on how much work

59
00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.220
can be in progress. Since some of the basics are like agile and

60
00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.430
Scrum that I see it as just refining your knowledge and skills and

61
00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.390
not making major adjustments.

62
00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:37.940
So rest easy, it should go pretty well for you.

63
00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.070
Here are the key objectives of Managing your Workflow module.

64
00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.700
You learned how to define your value stream.

65
00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.480
You determined where to start and end your value stream.

66
00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.380
That is what the process you will visualize and define.

67
00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:53.310
This is where you have control and influence over your work steps.

68
00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.630
You will discuss and negotiate with your upstream partners who will

69
00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:00.040
provide requirements, prioritization, and other project artifacts,

70
00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.730
such as budgets and resources,

71
00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.490
and you will negotiate with your downstream partners who

72
00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:07.270
can be those who put things into production, or even your

73
00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:09.370
end users. Know your work types.

74
00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.650
They can come in all shapes and sizes, such as features,

75
00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.840
bugs, user stories, issues, research needs, to just name a few.

76
00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:17.430
Also,

77
00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.760
it is important to know your sources from where those work types come

78
00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.840
from, such as sales, engineering, executives or vendors,

79
00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:24.790
for example.

80
00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:27.230
Understanding these will help you determine how best to

81
00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:29.200
fill out your card, color code it,

82
00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.900
place it in the right swim lanes, and therefore how best to handle it.

83
00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:36.970
A work task is only done when the done rule is satisfied.

84
00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:39.450
Everyone knows what the done rule is and what it

85
00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:42.030
means for every value stream step.

86
00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.190
That is why we have the additional Done column to clearly

87
00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.910
de‑mark that the work task is done.

88
00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.910
We clearly display the done criteria for each step

89
00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:53.730
above its column. Kanban limits work.

90
00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:58.050
This is a very powerful concept of kanban, and kanban limits work

91
00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.890
as follows. If you work on one item at a time,

92
00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:04.350
never two, it doesn't mean that an item can't go on hold

93
00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:06.170
and then pull another one forward.

94
00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:08.200
Pull only completed work forward.

95
00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.090
If the done rule is not satisfied,

96
00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.690
don't touch it, else you'll compromise quality.

97
00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:15.560
Each step is allocated a limited capacity.

98
00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.430
Now, you can change the capacity any time based on the

99
00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.390
fact that you can see a bottleneck.

100
00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:23.100
The only reason for a buffer is to ensure that there'll be a

101
00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:27.010
work task ready to pull when that resource is available. In

102
00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:30.040
theory, a buffer of 0 would be perfect,

103
00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:34.800
but that wouldn't be realistic, and having a buffer keeps things running smooth.

104
00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.190
A blocker is something that's restricting the flow of work,

105
00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:41.740
so therefore, blockers are things we want to handle ASAP.

106
00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:44.770
So part of your daily stand up is any discussions around

107
00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:47.740
blockers and what to do if it is out of control,

108
00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:52.070
which means you need an escalation process and policies clearly understood

109
00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:55.440
by everyone to help you solve and overcome your blockers.

110
00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:59.310
A bottleneck in a process flow is anywhere that an accumulation

111
00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:04.140
of work builds up waiting to be processed.

112
00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:08.620
Here are the key objectives to the module Organizational Challenges. Now,

113
00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:12.110
management or your team members may pose some key challenges.

114
00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:13.530
Why is this better?

115
00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:16.410
Will it save money? Will it be faster?

116
00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:18.040
Will this be disruptive?

117
00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:19.870
Why should I change?

118
00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:23.600
You need to present a solid plan and approach to management and get their

119
00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:27.770
buy‑in because you will need their support to ensure success.

120
00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:31.100
Kanban may be a steep learning curve for some of your team members,

121
00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:34.210
so provide kanban training, online tools,

122
00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:36.950
expert consultants, and most importantly,

123
00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:39.920
hands‑on, real life experience to get your team

124
00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:42.200
moving forward. Just get started.

125
00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:52.000
Organize the backlog, document the value stream, set up the board, determine your work in progress limits, create your done criteria, and go.
