00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.260
So in this video,

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.880
we're going to see how to install Melvin on a window system.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.040
So first that we need to check if we have Java installed have.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.850
The reason for this is that Melvin runs on Java,

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:18.590
which is what gives it its ability to run on multiple platforms.

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.840
So we need to ensure that we have a Judi Kane stalled on the system you're going to install

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:22.350
moving on.

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.350
So to check if we have job or installed will just go to a command prompt.

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:31.330
I usually have a shocker on my desktop to the command prompted you find quite useful.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:32.190
But if you don't have it,

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:34.950
you just go to the start menu programs,

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.090
accessories,

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:39.850
and then you'll find it there at the top.

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.950
But I have its own cancel out of that.

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:50.100
So if we go back to the command prompt so we just type job minus version and here answer.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.980
Then it will come back with the version of the Jedi kit that we have installed.

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:55.250
Does you can see on this system?

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.500
We have 1.8 of the Jodi K installed,

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:58.480
so that's good.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.320
Melvin requires at least 1.7 of the Jedi care to run.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.790
So we're good to go because it's still moving now at this point,

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:15.790
so just can set out with them on open up from So we just go to the address.

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:16.290
Spartans.

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.110
I may even don't Apache dog.

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.050
That's the website from heaven itself.

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:21.590
Answer.

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.500
Then here we are,

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.250
the meme website,

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.190
so we'll see the download link on the left now.

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:30.250
So let's just click that.

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.040
And when the first things we see is that we put the system requirements that we need

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:34.400
temperature.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.750
Dechaine stalled as we've just seen,

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:36.920
we have the Jedi Cain stole.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.310
So we're okay for prerequisites,

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.920
So just scroll down to the final section.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:42.520
At this point,

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.770
you'll see there are two distribution time speaking download.

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.250
You can either download the binary distribution or the source distribution,

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.060
so we're going down with the binder distribution because that's the version we need to use

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.060
.

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.170
If we just want to use members,

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.950
it'll the source distribution has the actual source got Amev in itself.

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.960
That's useful if you want to develop maven or write your own plug ins.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.820
But that's beyond the scope of this cost.

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.900
Where she was in members It also will download the binary distribution.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.990
So click on the Zip file link to download that.

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:20.940
So that's downloaded now,

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:21.410
statist,

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.700
come out of that window.

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:29.000
So once you've downloaded maven,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.790
what you need to do next is to copy across into a directory of Were you happy to have the

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:33.940
installation on your system?

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.180
So we've made what I tend to do is inform on Windows systems like to put all of the job

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.780
tools inside the same top level folder,

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.610
which is usually in secret on back slash Java.

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:48.000
I think it keeps everything nice and self contained and keeps the job of stuff separate

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.150
from the other programs that I got on the system.

00:02:50.150 --> 00:03:00.300
So if we just open a Windows Explorer now and never get to not see Java folder you've seen

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.740
there now all,

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:01.010
of course,

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.870
is the Jodi K.

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:02.440
That's OK,

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.590
but we're gonna put the Apache may have an installation in here as well,

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.370
so if we open up another window,

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.070
another Explorer window as well,

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:15.130
I never get to the Downloads folder.

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:22.850
Then we just drank the Apache movin zip into the si com backslash Java folder that's copied

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:26.010
across now so can close us to explore Windows down.

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:31.050
So let's go back into a command prompt.

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:43.740
And it would just CD into that job a folder and just double check that we've got the final

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:44.050
day.

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:45.250
Yeah,

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:46.260
if the deal Yeah,

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.250
we've got to file that.

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.910
It's an extent we can unpack the archive with a jar command.

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.410
So as long as you've got Java home set and you've got Java home been on your system path,

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:57.450
you'll be able to use the Giacomo.

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:57.990
And if not,

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:01.550
you could just don't compress with Windows decompression till Wednesday.

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:02.790
Poor seven step or whatever.

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:03.290
Anyway,

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:06.210
I've got it here some type jar x VF,

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:08.950
which is expert strikes leaf of a boss.

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:09.600
You know what's print out?

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:15.490
The listing on deaf to specify the file and the final here is a patch of heaven 350 been

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:18.520
dot zip enter.

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:27.380
Then you'll see extracting and we're just delete the zip file now because we don't need

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:28.000
that anymore.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.020
So just tell in the name of the final.

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:36.590
And so how much?

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.050
Just double check that that's gone now.

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.350
So CLS and then you stealing are the directory.

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:42.910
Yep,

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:46.270
that's going and close the command prompt down.

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.180
And next we're gonna go and set environment variable.

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.850
So going to Mt.

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:51.570
Wonders go home is an environment variable.

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:56.750
So if you just right click on the computer on the desktop and select properties,

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:58.810
then next up just click the link,

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:03.330
which has advanced system settings on from the pop up which appears,

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:07.150
Just go down to you the environment variables button and just click that.

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:08.560
And now,

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:09.040
at this stage,

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.520
we have two different types of environment verbal we can create.

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:17.550
We can create a user one All the system one eso use the ones I just applicable for the

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.640
current user system,

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:21.960
ones are applicable for more.

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.820
News is I like to set a system one,

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:27.460
just in case I have any other accounts or any other share a machine with any other people

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.370
who are developers who want to use the same tools that I use.

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:32.550
So I'm going to send its A system variable here.

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:37.690
So you just hit the new button to define a new environment variable.

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:39.560
And then here in the text box,

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:40.720
where it says variable name,

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.850
we're gonna give it em to underscore home in all Capitals.

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:46.110
This is the standard name for the environment.

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:46.760
Variable in maidan.

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:51.270
So do use that name because of the tools sometimes require that specific environment

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:51.650
variable.

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:56.460
So stick to the conventions on for the variable value We're gonna basically copy and paste

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:03.470
the the path to the Apache Move in full,

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:06.800
the world just down We're just unzipped to how we're gonna pissed in there.

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.470
So if we just go up to explore quickly,

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:15.470
never get across to that folder which we just expanded the zip file into on we're just

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:20.360
gonna go into the title bar that it's right just going to the address bother and so like

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:20.750
that.

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:23.280
Do you copy on?

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:28.340
Then go back over here and do a paste to the value section Thin.

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:28.750
Just click.

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:29.350
OK,

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:34.030
so now we can see we've got the empty wonders Go home environment variable set their next

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:34.190
up.

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:38.750
We need to basically upend the been subdirectory of that onto the system path.

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:41.450
So if we just scroll down here,

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:43.390
other environment variables,

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:44.950
we can see the path variable.

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:49.510
So just click the edit button here because I'm not defining a new environment rebel.

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:50.880
Now we're editing an existing one,

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:59.770
and we're just gonna depend to that path in the value textbooks shut up in semi column

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:07.750
percent m to underscore home percent backslash been and then he It's okay.

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:10.940
So this means we now have the been sub directory,

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:14.780
which contains the scripts from evidence of the M v n dot C M D script,

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:18.220
that it's got those defined and ready in the system path so we can execute the movement

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:20.550
command from whichever directory we happen to be in.

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:21.550
So just close that.

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:28.970
And now let's go back into a command prompt.

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:30.980
And if everything's worked,

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:35.670
we should just be able to type in M V in minus minus inversion.

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:37.430
Andi enter.

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:39.240
And if we haven't even installed correctly,

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:40.750
we should see the version message.

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:42.170
So answer.

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:44.000
And we do.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.190
You can see it gives information about the Melvin Home Directory,

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:48.070
which it's got defined,

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:52.470
which is where we unpacked the sit file to which version of the Janie Cates running on a

00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:53.830
few of the bits and pieces as well.

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:54.770
And at this stage,

00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:59.070
you ready to start developing applications and doing builds with Nevin on Windows
