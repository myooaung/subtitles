00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.200
in this video,

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.390
we're going to see how we use them,

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:10.410
ever until itself.

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.400
We're gonna take some first steps to get us familiar with how we actually involved.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.700
Movin on work with There's a tool and the best way of seeing how to do this is to actually

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:19.680
create a project.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.970
So let's create a brand new medicine project.

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:22.800
To do this.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.310
We're going to use the maven archetype Plug in.

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.850
I am a Guns used its generate goal,

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:29.880
so I'll explain what that means in a second.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:30.400
But first of all,

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.450
let me quit the project.

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:33.490
It's if we time nevan.

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:35.070
Oh,

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:35.280
good,

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:35.750
sweet.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.350
All right,

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:44.800
then maybe we'll basically go away and get all of the archetypes house,

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.540
of which it can create maven projects.

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:52.180
So an archetype in memory is basically a template for a project consisting of various files

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.590
and folders which can be copied across on talking,

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.990
replaced and form the basis of the new project.

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.300
So,

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.130
as you can see here,

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:59.990
there are quite a lot of archetypes available.

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:06.410
There's 1818 so that's a bit overwhelming from the outside to look at for an introductory

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.860
video.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.010
So you can actually filter this list,

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:10.670
so we're gonna filter it with a command line,

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:11.300
switch safe.

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.230
I just come out of that and clear the screen.

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:18.580
Then we can filter the list this time to just give the what I call the standard Melvin

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:19.300
archetypes.

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.650
Some of the words does supplied by the maven project itself.

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:23.740
So let me out of the box ones.

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.350
If you will sit with Melvin archetype,

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.320
generate again and this time with a minus D switch.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.720
Whatever you want to pass switches to Melvin,

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.490
you pass them with a minus d.

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.080
So it's just like passing a standard job assistant property in that respect,

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.580
so minus d filter equals.

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.470
And then this is going to be the so called group I d off the archetypes of one's air filter

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:46.810
on.

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:48.540
So this is a dog.

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.350
But she,

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:51.400
I don't know,

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.550
even thought archetypes.

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.100
And to tell members that where filtering on a group I d.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.860
We put a colon afterwards,

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.860
whenever you are referring to artefacts.

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:03.550
In Levin,

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.680
you have three constituent parts to the artifact.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:07.550
You have a group I d.

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:08.690
On artifact tidy.

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:09.370
An aversion.

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:10.940
We'll cover more of this later on.

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:16.150
But basically typically these air separated by colons when they become parameters to

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.080
certain commands.

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.850
So if we just hit enter there,

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.990
this should filter is down to a much more manageable list,

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:26.240
and that's a lot better here.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.570
We have 12 to choose from,

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:28.990
which is much better.

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.670
But either way,

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.820
whether we get the large list or whether we get the small filtered list,

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.790
you'll find that the Melvin system defaults to what's known as the quick Start archetype,

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.900
which is the most basic archetype that Nevin offers to start projects out off.

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.600
So if we select them annoying as the default,

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:45.250
um,

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.810
it's asking is which version we want to use.

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.570
So we're just gonna use the latest version.

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.150
So it defaults there already to number six,

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.370
which is version 1.1,

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.860
which is the latest version of that particular archetype next,

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.020
modifying a value for our group.

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:00.210
I d off the project.

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.080
So here we're just gonna create a group.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.380
Already have come prevention training dot demo.

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:07.660
The artifact I d.

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.960
Is the name of the artifacts we're gonna create.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.210
So it's just create an artifact called my APP on.

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:16.210
The version will leave this at 10 snapshot.

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:17.250
This is fine for now.

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.710
And finally the package will leave.

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:20.980
The package is the same as well,

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:21.350
for now.

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:26.500
So if you say yes to all that he shows you the settings is going to build the project from

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.670
just say yes and there you have it.

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.090
It's created you a new project and end out of the artifact.

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.370
Ideally,

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:33.150
you specified.

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.680
Call my app on.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.230
That's available for further development.

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.210
So we'll check out what's in there in subsequent videos on Get starting developing.

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:43.550
But that's how you create a project in heaven with Nevin archetypes.
