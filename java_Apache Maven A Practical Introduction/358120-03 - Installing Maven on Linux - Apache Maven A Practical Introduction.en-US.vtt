00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.910
So in this walk through,

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.560
we're going to use a bunch of Lennox,

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.930
which is a version 16.0 for LTs.

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:14.690
But whatever limits,

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:15.200
distribution,

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.620
use,

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.050
ultimately the process is gonna be the same if I just log in here.

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:26.360
So we're going to install member in the traditional way,

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:31.270
which is pretty much to download the zip from the 11 website extracted to the directory.

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:33.150
We're happy to have it on the local system,

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:34.140
separate environment,

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.030
variable to point to that directory on,

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.940
then ensure that that directories bitten subdirectory is on the system path so that we can

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.890
use the mental eso is probably easier to demonstrate visually then to explain it so we'll

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:46.690
just get started.

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:56.650
So if I got to the mainland website may even don't patchy toe dog and just go to the

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:57.670
download section.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:03.390
I'm from here.

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.930
You can see that we need to have a jail UK installed,

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:07.360
which we have already,

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.410
and you can just go down to the final section.

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:15.660
You'll see there are two types of distribution you can download,

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:17.400
So we're going down with the bite of a distribution,

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.410
the source distribution.

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.270
You can also download at some point if you like,

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.600
But that concerns the actual source code of heaven itself,

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.550
which is going down with the binary distribution.

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.130
So we'll click on this time.

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.750
But you said fine here to download it.

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:35.050
Just say okay to that.

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:43.380
I can see it's downloading Afghanistan loaded,

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.190
which is great.

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.520
So So just close this down,

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.120
go back to the terminal saying that actually have the option of installing two a slash opt

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.270
or a slash user slash local directory path.

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.540
My preference with old job totals is to have them pretty much in a slash opt slash java

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.940
folder.

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.250
So this keeps all the tools nice and together puts them all in one place.

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.610
And it also means as well that if I want to just uninstall something a lot.

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.650
But it was just doing our a minus so far on the particular subdirectory contends that all

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.840
So we're gonna install it to slash opt slash Java.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.670
So first off,

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.190
we'll check if we have that folder,

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.800
and if not,

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:20.410
what created?

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.350
So do we have opt?

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.590
Yes,

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:23.230
we have opted,

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.300
but we don't have the Jarvis of directory,

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:37.760
so I'm just gonna create that now with Sudha So now we should see we have that directory.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.150
Yes,

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.970
we have the job direction.

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:49.050
That's good sort of seedy into their unclear the terminal to get a bit more space.

00:02:49.050 --> 00:03:02.330
So now we can just unpack that into the current directory and we should know,

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:03.480
See the made in full today,

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.880
which we do.

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.070
So it's just seedy into that and just have a quick look we should see have been

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:14.250
subdirectory within their and it would just have a look at the files in there.

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:15.480
Yeah,

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.790
then we can see here that the MEV in shell scripts that we need all have the excusable flag

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:20.070
set,

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:23.490
which means that we don't have to do any setting of that flag to make them excusable.

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.990
If we did,

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:28.100
we'd have to do a show more U plus X in the file itself to add that execute permission.

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.900
But that all looks good,

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:29.550
so that's fine.

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.650
So the next thing to do is to add this path to the profile tripped,

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:33.790
which runs when you log in.

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.200
It's gonna be a dot profile in your home directory or dot Bashar See,

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.550
depending on how you have things set up,

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.110
I'm gonna put in the dock profile.

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:41.700
So we need to ensure that that path,

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.200
which is opt Java Apache maybe 350 is assigned to an environment variable called Mnc Wonder

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:46.760
Scott home.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.300
And then we just make sure that Emma to underscore home Slash Ben is appended to the system

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.700
path.

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.340
And that means that we should be able to run Melvin from inside a directory on the system.

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:55.500
Let's just do that now.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:56.250
Clear them out.

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.050
So if I just copy this,

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:08.580
I'm then going to the profile,

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:13.010
put him to the end.

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:23.080
I'm gonna penned two lines here on export em to underscore home equals and then passed in

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.250
that pathway is copied.

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:29.080
And then finally,

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:36.510
we're going to dependents of a system path and to let us go home.

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:37.230
Slash been,

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:38.250
then save that.

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:52.890
So if you just look out and look back in again No,

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:58.620
I look back in now,

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:59.750
if we go to the terminal,

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:07.550
we should be able to type in envy in minus minus version,

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:13.540
and we'll see that the maven tool has been installed and it has so from here now it is

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:14.100
wearing a patch,

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.400
remember?

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.430
350 It shows us theme Evan Harm Directory,

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:20.400
which is where we installed it to and also shows the Jedi care.

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:21.240
But it's run against,

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.830
which is 1.80131 At this point,

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:26.780
you're ready to start creating applications and doing bills of Melvin.
