00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.350
in this field.

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:11.700
We're going to have a simple dependency to our project and see what happens.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:12.750
One performer build.

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.480
So I have the project open here.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:15.490
So let's just look at the Palm,

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:18.620
the XML file in sublime text and they won't have the dependency there.

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:19.850
They were in the project,

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:21.710
and we have the pom xml file opened up.

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.810
Now I'm gonna grab a very simple dependency.

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:25.250
I want to say a simple dependency.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.570
I mean,

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:27.700
this dependency doesn't rely on other dependencies,

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.650
so it's just a simple dependency which had resolved to just a single Joel Files being

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.430
downloaded and installed in my local movement report cash and subsequently used in the

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.800
build.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.680
So I'm gonna quickly go to the front end for the mid in central repository on just copy

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.840
across the dependency snippet that I already have opened their for that particular

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:44.470
dependency.

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:45.230
So this project,

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:46.870
we're going to add Commons Land,

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:48.950
which is from the Apache Commons Project.

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.770
So I'm gonna go down here and then a copy this dependency information go back to sublime.

00:00:53.770 --> 00:01:01.900
Copy that in more.

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.320
Just tidy that up quickly.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.630
Save that and that will go back out a terminal and do a build whilst also looking at that

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.910
particular area in the Melbourne local report cash where the jar file should be downloaded

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:13.200
to.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.780
And we just keep an eye on that folder as we do the build and see that it's downloaded.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:17.610
Okay,

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.380
so here we are,

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.940
with the terminal session at the root of the project on the bottom part screen on the top

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:23.600
part of screen,

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.780
we are looking at the repository folder,

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.010
which is the local Melvin report.

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.410
Cash.

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:29.820
This is in Tilda empty repository.

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.450
We just check in here manually.

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:41.890
We'll see that we I don't have a Commons line before the which corresponds with the group

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.850
party off the dependency that we downloading clear than out.

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.460
And we could also see that we don't have it here either.

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.720
So it would be around this section here,

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.310
So when we actually go ahead and do build example,

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.030
supposing we compile the card,

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:01.030
then we should see that maybe notices it hasn't got that dependency on down with dependency

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.240
and cashing in the local metal rebar cash.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:11.610
Let's just do that now and see that happen on the first things done as we've seen,

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.070
it's gone off and downloaded Commons Lang in this section here.

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.020
And if we look at the log inch of this will see that it should have download it to the same

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.300
area from 11 Central repository,

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:23.790
which is this section here.

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.100
So commas lane comes lying to 0.6,

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:32.830
which is split into the group I d offer dependency and the artifact idea dependency,

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:33.540
which in this case,

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.220
they happen to be the same on the version which we specified.

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.150
So this corresponds on our system to Commons Lang Group I,

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.220
D Commons,

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.780
Long artifact 70 2.6.

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:50.060
And then finally the jar file itself corresponding to the simple dependency which maybe

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.670
they just downloaded out of this point.

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.930
We're going to an I d and start using Commons lang within the project.

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.170
And this is how my heavenly resolves a simple dependency and installs it into the local

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.410
member.

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.750
Report.

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.590
Cash ready for use in subsequent builds
