00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.340
So in this video,

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.480
we're going to have a quick look inside the maven installation itself and just talk about a

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.000
few files that are there which are useful to know about.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:15.960
To do this,

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.930
you need to find out where you've installed move into.

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.580
So if you're not sure or if you have an existing installation,

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.550
if you type may have in minus minus version and hit enter,

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:25.860
then you'll see you have,

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:26.100
um,

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.240
Evan Home Directory,

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.110
which is defined.

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:30.910
So if you take a look inside that Melvin Home directory,

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:36.360
this is the actual installation directory where the seven commanders pointing to at the

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:36.730
minute.

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.030
So we have a look inside here now when my system this is actually assembling.

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.720
So if I full of the same link with a capital L.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.370
It'll show me inside what's actually inside that directory.

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.290
So this is the contents off the member installation itself.

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:54.440
So this is the maven tool,

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:55.030
basically.

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.580
So all the scripts that needed to run the configuration files the libraries,

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:59.280
that kind of thing.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.310
You don't normally have to look inside here,

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:02.370
but sometimes it's useful.

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.600
Just have a quick check to see what's in there,

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:11.800
so if we have a look inside there in the finder or just a couple of things,

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.970
I want to point out which are useful to everyday use of MEV in most of this stuff.

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.660
Here in the installation itself is the internals of heaven,

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:20.890
so we don't really care about it.

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:21.390
However,

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.260
stuff that's relevant to the user of heaven is in the billions of the rectory.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.250
So we have these two commands.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:27.390
He,

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:27.570
um,

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.500
Evan and moveon dot cmd On the MEV in command without the sandy suffix is a shell script,

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.530
which launches the middle income online to itself.

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:37.670
For Lennix,

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:43.440
Mac and UNIX on the moveon dot cmd script is about schrute,

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.020
which performs the same function for Windows users.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.930
So if you're on Windows when you include this been subdirectory on your path.

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:50.670
It's the member,

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.040
not cmd file that several on DFO clinics,

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.130
UNIX or Mac users.

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:56.220
It's the M V in command,

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:56.810
which is run.

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.150
They're also MBN Debo commands here.

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.440
This is if you want to run the maven tool with debug options,

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.130
so jeopardy a debug options.

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.310
You could establish remote deep accession to steps with the build.

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.570
If you wanted to do that,

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:10.560
so that can be useful.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.100
Sometimes.

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.260
If you're running unit tests on,

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.340
you want to step towards and tests or they're in the container,

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.580
that kind of stuff is the thing I want to talk about is the conch subdirectory.

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.790
So this has a useful filing here called settings dot XML.

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.400
On this is basically the default settings file from heaven itself.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.950
So we just have a quick look at this in sublime text.

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.370
They will see that it's and regulates the Mel file so we can see the settings tags.

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.770
Here on there are various different sections,

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:40.600
which you can uncommon to customize some of the default settings of Melvin.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:41.220
So,

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.870
for example,

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:48.760
that a local repository thing here so usually Levin creates a local repository Cash in the

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:49.490
Home directory.

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:51.240
Don't into a repository.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.890
You can change it here if you want.

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:53.600
For example,

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.850
there's other stuff as well relating to you.

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.290
Plugging groups,

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:59.110
service also,

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.540
proxies.

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:00.380
They're quite interesting.

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:01.930
If you're behind a firewall,

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.340
are you in like a corporate environment?

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.080
Then you may want to.

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.450
In fact,

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.490
you may have to configure a proxy here to get outside of the network to the public Internet

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:10.690
to the main repository,

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.000
which is used where dependence is that downloaded from.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.560
So,

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:14.770
yes,

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:16.560
there's various different bits in that you can have a look at,

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.430
and we'll cover how to customize those in another video.

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:20.060
But for now,

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.220
that's all I wanted to talk about,

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.290
just to give you a bit of a guide to show you what's in the maven installation directory

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.800
itself.
