00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.230
in this video.

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:12.750
I just want to talk about the different invocation modes that you can use in Melbourne when

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.000
invoking Amev in command line.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.300
So maybe really has two different invocation modes,

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:24.130
which you can use that is styles of command line that you use when you interact with Melvin

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:24.810
through its commander.

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:25.980
Until envy in,

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:34.170
we can either invoke heaven fire a phase such as Melvin compile or 11 package or move

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.250
unclean whenever you see a word on its own in 11 after the methane command that this

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:40.260
denotes a phase.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.520
So this is a phase in the build life cycle that's gonna be invoked.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:44.550
Alternatively,

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.720
we could also specify a goal which is executed within a particular plug in that Melvin

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:50.300
supplies.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.710
So we've seen this before.

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.850
We've seen this with the archetype generate,

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:55.880
plugging or goal.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:56.300
Rather,

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.950
And in this former you can see that the format is basically to have the plug in and then

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:01.660
the colon,

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.950
and then the goal that you're executing within that plug in.

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.510
So if I see this command on,

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.820
it's not a single word when it's separated by a column that I know that this is basically

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.050
invoking the generate goal from the archetype plug in.

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:16.570
So that's basically the former of those commands.

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:17.700
So it's Heithem Evan,

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.900
then affairs of the Bill five cycle or its Melvin plug in colon goal,

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.370
so actually perform at their,

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:25.750
which is worth pointing out.
