00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.830
everybody.

00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:05.260
And welcome to this lesson are looking at machine learning that's offered by AWS.

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:11.230
AWS has a pretty broad and deep set off machine learning and AI services to cater to almost

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:13.190
any business of any size.

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.580
There's many different things you can choose from,

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:22.940
such as pre trained AI services for computer vision language recommendations forecasting.

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.640
And then there's also the Amazon sage maker,

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.270
which you can use to build,

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:29.070
train and employ machine learning models.

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.990
And we'll look at sage Maker a little more deeply in another section.

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:35.300
But just to give you guys an or review.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:40.100
Sage maker is basically one of the main machine learning services that are offered by

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.930
Amazon,

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.750
and it's very customizable in that you are able to build,

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.840
train and deploy your own customized machine learning models based on even your own,

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:50.700
a log rhythm.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.350
Or you can use one of the building,

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.090
a log rhythms that are offered by AWS and again,

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.870
like I mentioned,

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:56.770
Ah,

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.890
there's an entire section in this course dedicated to Amazon.

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.220
Sage makers will look at specifically how you can build your machine learning model,

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:10.130
train it using the different logarithms and then how you can deploy it in Amazon Web

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:16.480
services to give you guys an or view of some of the other services that are offered by AWS

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.480
.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:22.910
These AI services Utkan basically very easily integrate them with your applications to

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:28.650
address common cases that as if you want personalized recommendations or if you're trying

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.310
to improve safety and security,

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.630
or if you're trying to increase your customer engagement and trying to get more analytics

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.910
to improve your marketing campaigns or improve your operations,

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:44.030
these various services all allow you to do that very easily and quite often,

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.750
very simply.

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:45.700
So.

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.760
There's one service called recommendations,

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.570
which personalized experiences for customers with the same recommendation technology that's

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.200
used by amazon dot com.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.010
So again,

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.880
I'm sure all of us are familiar with amazon dot com and the robustness off it and how it

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.110
personalizes almost everything for you when you go on it so you can use that same

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.510
technology and that same service that they used to personalize your experience.

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:12.270
When you go on their website and implement that within your own organization,

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.590
whether it's an e commerce website or whether you have your own corporate website,

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:22.140
you can use the same information that amazon dot com is using and try to implement that

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.790
maybe at a smaller scale in your own organization.

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:30.760
There's also yuk unbilled accurate forecasting models based on machine learning technology

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.760
.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.020
For example,

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.910
we're trying to ah forecast your sales for the next quarter or for the next year,

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.180
or you're trying to forecast the amount of users that are going to be hitting your website

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.050
or your e commerce site that you're launching or that you're building up.

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.900
You can use those machine learning models to forecast,

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:48.550
even,

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:49.250
for example,

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.330
how much stock to order so you can minimize the stock that you guys have or you keep in

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.830
your house.

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:58.550
So there's various applications they can use their forecasting for.

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:04.520
There's also image and video analysis that you can add to your applications to catalog

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:05.100
assets.

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.290
Automate media workflow is extract meaning and much more.

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:09.720
Additionally,

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.910
you can use national language processing,

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:12.980
toe extract,

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.200
insights and relationships from unstructured text.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.220
You can also do a document analysis,

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:19.310
for example,

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.800
you can extract text and data from millions of documents in amount of hours,

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.040
reducing ah lot of manual effort that a lot of us do and trying to analyze the different

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.940
documents regardless off which industry that we're currently and and various other ones.

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:33.300
For example,

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.940
there's voice.

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.300
You can turn text to lifelike speech.

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:38.860
You can use chatbots,

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.070
which referred to as conversational agents.

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.200
You can use translation services.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.260
There's also transcription services,

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.780
which is basically easily can easily add high quality speech to text capabilities to your

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.650
applications and to your work flows.

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:57.320
There's a host of different AI services that are offered by machine learning that AWS

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.830
offers.

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:02.600
So depending on you know what we're trying to do within the eye framework or within the

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:07.100
machine learning from where we can pick and choose to implement various services within

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:08.170
that AI framer,

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:13.450
you guys see Hannibal made that in your and our applications in our business processes and

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.470
to add to those A S services.

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:20.820
AWS also offers a host of other services to make it a complete package for you.

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:21.440
For now,

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:22.820
we can get the right compute.

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:23.780
For any use case,

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:29.540
you can leverage a broad set of powerful easy to instances ranging from GP use for compute

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:30.600
instant intensive,

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:31.250
deep learning.

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:37.050
Two F PGA is for a specialized hardware acceleration to memory instances for running

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.540
inference.

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:38.970
So these easy to instances,

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:42.280
which are basically your virtual machines RV,

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:42.680
EMS,

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.680
offer a range of hardware options that you can pick and choose from.

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.460
The best part about it is you don't have to provisioned them on a permanent basis.

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:51.430
You can use,

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.950
for example,

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:53.390
something called on demand,

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:55.800
so they're only provisioned when you need them.

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.350
So if there's off peak hours,

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:01.100
you can scale down your instances on on peak hours.

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:02.500
You can scale up your instances,

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:03.290
so it's a very,

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:08.400
very cost effective way to manage your infrastructure on the cloud.

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.020
And they also offer analytics and security from machine learning.

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.500
So in order to do machine learning successfully,

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.700
you not only need the capabilities,

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:18.570
but he also need the right security.

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:23.910
You need the right data store and you need the right analytics service toe work together in

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:28.380
harmony in orderto have a very good and well functioning machine learning model.

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:29.920
And with AWS,

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:32.570
it offers all of that through the S three services,

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:36.150
re storage to AWS analytics and eight of your security.

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:39.550
So it kind of brings everything together for you in one package.

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:40.510
Additionally,

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:44.780
there's a couple of neat learning tools that are within the airframe work.

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:49.640
You can get deep with machine learning through something called the AWS Deep Razor,

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:51.580
which is the car that you guys see on there.

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:53.690
So it's basically a fully autonomous,

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:58.600
18 scale race car designed to help you learn about reinforcement learning through

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:59.610
autonomous driving.

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:03.670
And we'll talk about reinforcement learning a little bit later on in a bit more detail

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:07.990
because that's one of the most up and coming areas off the machine,

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:11.350
learning that especially used for autonomous driving.

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:12.390
You can experience,

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:13.340
for example,

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:17.300
what it's like to race in the real world when you deploy your own re first Met learning

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.020
model into the AWS Deep Racer.

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:23.630
There's also the deeplens,

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:26.560
which is which is the camera you guys see on the bottom,

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:26.950
right?

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:32.540
So it's basically the world's first deep learning enabled video camera that's primarily

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:33.770
develop for developers.

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:38.510
It's integrated with sage maker and many other AWS services and allows you to get started

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:41.370
with deep learning in minimal amount of time,

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:42.140
and most times,

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:43.240
if you're trying to set it up,

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:48.610
you can probably do it in less than 10 minutes and the best part about it is is it's all

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:49.880
integrated to AWS,

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:53.850
and you can watch the results real time through the AWS console.

00:06:53.850 --> 00:07:00.750
So this is basically just to give you guys an or view and a broad understanding off what

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:04.300
AWS offers through machine learning and the capabilities that it offers.

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:09.590
So it's basically a one stop shop for you to do everything that is a I or machine learning

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:12.090
related and and for me,

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:16.400
the best part about it is everything is available in one console in one area,

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:21.760
so you don't need to go to several different platforms or several different programs to do

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:25.860
machine learning everything and be done right here within the AWS framework.
