00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.210
Hi,

00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:00.620
everybody,

00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.180
and welcome this lesson on looking at the Trooper notebook and walking you through how to

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:07.080
install Jupiter on your PC.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.740
So the Jupiter notebook is an incredibly powerful tool for Inter actively developing and

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:14.540
presenting data science projects.

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:17.000
A notebook basically integrates code,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.620
and it's output into a single document that combines visualizations,

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:21.750
nerd of tax,

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.020
mathematical equations and other rich media.

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.270
The workflow promotes iterative and rapid development,

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.920
making notebooks and increasingly popular choice at the heart of contemporary data,

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:33.260
signs,

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:34.150
analysis and,

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.730
increasingly,

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:35.850
science at large.

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.460
Best of all,

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.570
as part of the open source project Jupiter,

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.110
they're completely free.

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:42.250
Now.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.860
There are multiple,

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.200
different ways on how we can install and work with Jupiter.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.780
One way is we can work on it through the online interface,

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.270
and you guys can see it's all cloud based,

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:54.700
so there's no installation that's required.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:00.470
Always simply do is a navigate to the Jupiter website We navigato.

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:06.680
I'm a get on the cloud and assumes we collect on the Jupiter notebook is going to go ahead

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:13.510
and launch the Jupiter notebook instance on the cloud for us and again the entire project.

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:15.850
It's free of cost of There's no cost of doing this,

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:16.820
even on the cloud.

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.220
And there we go.

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:19.350
It's as simple as that.

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.110
Click and go,

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.780
and we can start working with our notebook instances right from there.

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:24.640
Another way off.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.760
Installing Jupiter notebook is on our local PC.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:33.990
One thing to keep in mind that you will need to have python and 3.3 or greater installed on

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.280
your PC if you want to work with Jupiter notebooks locally,

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.080
and the best way of doing that is through a software called Anaconda,

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.870
which is also free.

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:51.050
So that's what we're gonna walk through now is using and installing Jupiter by downloading

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.910
the anaconda,

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:56.140
which weaken Do through that you are all that you guys see on top So soon every click on

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.010
the download button.

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.610
We can pick and choose which version off python that we want to work with.

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:01.170
And again,

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.900
this is the worst in that is installed on your local PC s previous to installation off

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:06.640
Anaconda.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.750
So after we download the version that we want to install,

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.610
we're gonna go ahead and walk through the installation process.

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.580
It's a pretty straightforward process.

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.050
As soon as you double click on the executed was going to launch the Anaconda installer for

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.540
us.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.500
We're gonna go ahead and click on next,

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.650
agreed to the terms.

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.260
And here's where we can select whether we want the anaconda to be available just for you or

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.950
for all users.

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.450
They're working on this PC.

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.070
We're gonna leave the default destination folder.

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.300
There's no need on changing that.

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:43.400
And we want to make sure that we stick with the option that is making use off Python and

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.150
not have it in the path environment.

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.190
Because if you have the path,

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:51.290
environment is going to start up when your PC starts up before most of the services and

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:52.930
sometimes that will cause issues,

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.140
especially if you're working in a Windows environment.

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:01.550
We're gonna go and click on next and wait for the insulation files to install on the PC.

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:07.450
And they're yet another way that we can install is through the command line interface.

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.050
If you're more advanced user and you would work with python already,

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.000
you can use the Pip three installed Jupiter Command through the command line interface,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.150
and it will download the Jupiter files and have it installed on your local PC.

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.750
So there's multiple ways on how we can install and work with Jupiter.

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.760
So one of the first ones that we saw is we can either work on it on a purely cloud based

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.220
environment through the Jupiter website,

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.650
where nothing has installed on our local machine.

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.630
But if you are more than more advanced users and you will be doing some advanced work with

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.630
,

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.600
Jupiter is always recommended that we haven't installed locally.

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.740
And even on the local installation,

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:43.850
we have a couple of options.

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:50.490
We can either download the anaconda and work on it through their Oregon down water directly

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:52.730
to our machine through the command line interface.

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:53.330
And again,

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.520
the command for that is Pip three installed Jupiter,

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:00.390
which will download everything on our local machines in terms of the Jupiter notebook

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:01.090
instances,

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:02.980
and we can work on it from there.

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:08.080
So there are three main ways that we can work with and download the Jupiter notebook to

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:12.970
start working with the data science on our local machines or through the cloud based

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:13.930
interface.

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:14.980
And there we have it.

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.960
We have it just successfully installed it through the command line interface also
