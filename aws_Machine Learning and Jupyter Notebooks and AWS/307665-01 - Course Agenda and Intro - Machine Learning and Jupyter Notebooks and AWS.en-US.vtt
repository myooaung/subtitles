00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.530
So the world of artificial intelligence,

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:08.570
machine learning as well as cloud computing and big data is growing exponentially.

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:15.060
More and more enterprise organizations that I work with myself as a senior project manager

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:15.060
,

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:21.970
enterprise architect and helping these organizations develop solutions based on cloud.

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:28.000
Because the only viable alternative left coming in future is actually going to cloud

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.100
computing and working with machine learning and artificial intelligence.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:31.560
Which is,

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.240
of course,

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.930
the most growing field at this point in time.

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.890
And it is going to grow further as we move ahead of time.

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:46.950
Welcome to this course on working with AWS Machine Learning using Jupiter notebooks

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.750
together myself and my co instructor Simcha,

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.770
we've designed this course specifically keeping in mind the real world scenario.

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.230
So let me walk you through the course agenda.

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:00.780
In this course,

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.460
we are going to start off with the basics off what AWS machine learning is.

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:05.540
So if you're a beginner,

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:06.150
perfect,

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:13.600
we're also don't explain the types of machine learning in a manner that is most

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.650
understandable.

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:15.160
And,

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.530
of course,

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.670
then we are going to apply all of these concepts using Jupiter notebooks and work with

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.190
Amazon sagemaker as well.

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.440
Let me backtrack a little bit.

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.520
So we'll talk about the AWS machine learning concepts such as unsupervised learning,

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:29.870
supervised learning,

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:30.900
reinforcement,

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:31.320
learning,

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.630
working with structure data,

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:33.590
unstructured data.

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.870
So you will get a solid understanding of all of these concepts.

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:38.620
And,

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.900
of course,

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.100
we're gonna take all these concepts and apply them using Jupiter notebooks and working with

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.760
code such as python or Java or any other coat.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.790
Then we'll get into the Amazon sage maker,

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:57.540
which allows developers to build and train A I am she learning models so that we can do

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.950
predictive analysis or other analytical analysis.

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.200
Who is this course for?

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.880
We've designed this course for complete beginners as well at some intermediate.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:09.900
So if you were in Twitter,

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:13.240
user of AWS for other cloud computing technologies such as azure,

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.650
you may learn a tip and techniques out of this course.

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.790
So the ultimate goal is to provide you valuable content,

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.940
working with real world projects and use cases.

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.390
So it's not just talking about definitions in terms,

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.010
but actually taking those terms and definitions concepts and applying in a real world

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.550
scenario,

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.350
working hands on using Amazon Web services.

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:38.770
So by the end of this course,

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:44.120
you will not only gain valuable skills or maybe enhance your skills and get some valuable

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.950
content.

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.220
And this will help you improve your career.

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.250
Maybe if you're working in projects,

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.750
you will definitely see this course as being a valuable I've.

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.050
We value your feedback,

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.450
please feel free to provide your feedback so we can make our courses better and better.

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:00.350
Together,

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.110
we're teaching over 200,000 happy students that you know me.

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.690
And we're super excited to bring you these courses.

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.950
We have over 45 courses so far.

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.880
So based on our student feedback,

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.350
we've actually designed this specific course so you can get some valuable skills.

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:22.380
So if you're ready to learn machine learning within AWS working with sage maker working

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:23.560
with Jupiter notebooks,

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.350
this is the right course for you.

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.260
