00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.700
everybody.

00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.890
So now that we have Jupiter downloaded and installed through Anaconda,

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.500
let's go three and see how we can run and save notebooks,

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.950
familiarize ourselves with the structure and understand interface.

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:13.650
So let's go ahead and ah,

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.050
launch our anaconda instance that we just downloaded in the previous lesson.

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:19.750
And from there,

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:24.060
what we're going to do is go ahead and launch our Jupiter instance.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.720
So after you opened up an economy as Houston see,

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.210
there are many different things and programs that we can launch through Anaconda.

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.790
But the one that we want to work with for the purposes of this course is and this

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.440
demonstration is specifically the Jupiter notebook.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.000
Some to go ahead and click on launch to launch the Jupiter notebook instance,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.180
and it's going to open up a tab in my browser for the for the notebook.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.670
Now,

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.080
this isn't not a notebook just yet,

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:54.180
but don't worry who are gonna walk you through step by step on how to create it into a

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.810
notebook.

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:56.390
Just keep in mind.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.870
As I had mentioned the previous lesson that there are multiple ways off working with this.

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.760
You can also work on on the cloud so even though it opened it up in your browser.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.090
This is still working from your local machine,

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:08.220
as you guys conceive from the U.

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:08.670
R L.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:09.680
It is a local host,

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.090
meaning that this notebook instant is working from your local machine.

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.910
So the Dad dashboard basically will give you access only to the files and sub folders

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:20.150
contained with Super Startup directory.

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.300
But the start of directory can be changed,

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.290
so it's possible to start the dashboard on any system.

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.370
Why the command prompt?

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.850
If you are familiar with current command promise,

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:35.470
so we want to do is go ahead and click on the drop down next to New and select Python three

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.700
or any different version off your choice.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:38.980
I stuck with Python three,

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:39.860
but if you have another one,

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:41.210
you can always do that.

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:42.840
So as soon as there that there we go,

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.040
we have our first Jupiter notebook open in a tab,

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.760
and each notebook uses its own tab,

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.280
and you guys can see when you go back.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.680
It has created an untitled I.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:52.920
P.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.550
Y and be file,

00:01:54.550 --> 00:02:01.420
And each file is a text file that describes a contents off a notebook in Jason Format and

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:02.970
each cell and its contents,

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.930
including image attachments that have been converted into strings of text,

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.650
is listed there in along with some metadata.

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:12.620
And you can also change the metadata yourself.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.460
You can edit it through there,

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:15.560
you can click on edit,

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.670
and you have an option off editing at the metadata.

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.300
Now I do highlight can.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:28.570
There's no need that you would need to modify the metadata on a regular base on a routine

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:29.000
basis.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.850
But this keep in mind that you do have an option to do that.

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:33.730
Another year.

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.030
The notebook instance in front of you.

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:40.610
It's interface will hopefully look not alien to you because Jupiter essentially is just an

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.150
advanced word processor.

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.540
Ah,

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:43.350
in a nutshell,

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:44.170
um,

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.280
you can do you guys can see some of the menus in the interface is very familiar.

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.430
Looks very familiar with it is modelled right after a word.

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:59.620
So there's two are fairly problem in terms that you should notice or keep in mind that we

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.190
have something called cells and kernels on their key,

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.750
both to understanding Jupiter and toe what makes it more than just a word processor.

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:13.150
So Colonel is basically a computational engine that executes the code contain in a notebook

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.670
document.

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.100
And if you guys remember arm using Python three.

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:23.060
But there are other codes and Colonel that you guys can use to as the computational engine

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.060
,

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:28.270
and the cell basically is a container for the text to be displayed on,

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:30.330
and we'll look at it.

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.950
Ah,

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.430
the colonel's and a little bit later.

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.170
But just keep in mind that the colonel is basically the engine that's going to drive this

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.850
whole thing.

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:45.580
So cells basically form the body of the notebook and in in the screen front of you Ah,

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.630
in the section above the box with the blue line and next to it is basically an empty self.

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.340
And there's two main types off cell.

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.360
We have a code cell and a markdown cell,

00:03:54.360 --> 00:04:00.210
so coat cell contains code to be executed and a markdown cell contains text formatted using

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:03.950
marked down and displays its output in place when it's run.

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.500
So the first hole and a new notebook is always a code self,

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:08.500
so let's try it out.

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:14.140
Let's see what happens if you type print hello world into the cell and then we click on the

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:18.860
run button that you guys can see on the top menu bar right under a cell.

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:20.050
There's an option to run.

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:21.290
So is she.

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:22.730
That assumes you do run.

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:23.910
We have Ah,

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:25.300
a Hello,

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.940
you dummy And next to it.

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:31.670
So that second cell is basically you refer to as your mark down cell and the first hole

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:34.310
where we typed print is your code cell.

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.370
And also,

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.030
when you're on the sell its output again,

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.130
you guys can see as displayed below,

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:44.770
and the label to its left has changed from blank to a one.

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:48.660
The output off a code cell also forms part of the document,

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.060
which is why you can see it and which is why you can see it.

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:56.290
You can always tell the difference between cold and markdown cells because coat cells have

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:59.670
that label on the left and mark down cells do not,

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:05.340
and the in part of the label is simply short for input.

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:10.240
While the label number indicates when the cell was executed on the Colonel and in this case

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.170
it was number one.

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:12.770
So on the issue,

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.360
if we run the cell again,

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:15.120
as you guys can see,

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.410
it has changed the number two because it was a second cell to be run in the colonel's that

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:20.670
keeps track off.

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:22.500
What cell was run went.

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:26.080
We're also able to insert cells either above and below,

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.230
depending on which order work.

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:29.720
We want to run the code.

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.900
So let's try out another one.

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:40.060
Let's try out a code for the following code to see what happens.

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.210
We're gonna type out import time,

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:45.970
and I'm going to give it a sleep off 10.

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:48.300
So let's see what happens.

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.300
Once I run this code,

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:56.910
you guys might notice that nothing's happened.

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:58.180
But you guys see the ass trick,

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:58.620
right?

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:00.250
Right in the cell.

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:04.560
What should be a number and gastric means that the job is currently running.

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:07.480
If you notice I gave it a time,

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:08.500
sleep off.

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:09.050
10.

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:15.990
Basically meaning that all I'm doing is running this code or having the machine run this

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:17.390
for 10 seconds.

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:19.980
So it's after the 10 seconds is up.

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:21.820
It's going to give that a number,

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:23.130
and it was should give it a number.

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:25.960
So in general,

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:30.270
the output off a cell comes from any text data specifically printed during the cells.

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:34.650
Execution as role as a value of the last line in the Selby alone.

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:35.210
Variable ah,

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:37.050
function cell or something else.

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:42.440
So then you'll find yourself using that almost constantly in your own projects,

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:45.750
and we'll see a lot of it throughout the rest of this course.

00:06:45.750 --> 00:07:05.360
And also you guys can see it is the example that I'm doing in the third cell and just keep

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:05.740
in mind.

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:10.470
There are lots of other keyboard shortcut that you guys should familiarize yourselves with

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:10.470
,

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:12.150
and I will have.

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:20.970
And I have included a sheet that you escandalo that has few handy shortcuts for for

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:24.470
different keyboard tour cause that you guys can use while using the Jupiter notebooks.

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:27.950
It's always good to familiarize yourself with this Jupiter book,

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:31.320
especially if you're doing or are going to working on machine learning.

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:33.010
This is an essential part of it.
