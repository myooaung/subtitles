00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:08.805
WordPress powers a huge percentage of websites available today.

00:00:08.805 --> 00:00:13.634
You've almost certainly visited a website which runs on WordPress.

00:00:13.634 --> 00:00:19.110
Some of the biggest names and brands of trusted WordPress including Disney,

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.995
PlayStation, MTV, Microsoft, Sony,

00:00:22.995 --> 00:00:24.885
and so many more.

00:00:24.885 --> 00:00:28.940
The good news is, it's easy for beginners to get started with and

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:33.500
you don't need to know any coding to build amazing websites.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.050
During this course, I will guide you through

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.175
the process of building multiple WordPress websites.

00:00:39.175 --> 00:00:41.810
Including a music festival landing page,

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:45.425
a blog, and also an e-commerce site too.

00:00:45.425 --> 00:00:48.965
Once you are familiar with WordPress from these projects,

00:00:48.965 --> 00:00:53.000
we then step things up even further and introduce some code by

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.145
converting a regular website into a fully custom WordPress theme.

00:00:58.145 --> 00:01:01.430
Before rounding things off by taking a look at how we can setup

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:07.355
a WordPress multi-site installation. Who am I?

00:01:07.355 --> 00:01:11.240
My name is Chris and I'm a web developer from the UK.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:17.350
For me WordPress has allowed me to create lots of amazing sites for clients or businesses

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:24.140
or personal use from a single landing page right through to a complex e-commerce site.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.400
It does this by providing a flexible core and then pose

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.270
as a user and extend it with a huge selection of plug-ins,

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.310
it extended the functionality.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:43.260
Let's jump into learning WordPress together by building some fun and educational project.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.240
I'll see you in the first lesson.
