00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.580
If you built a website in the past using HTML and CSS,

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.440
you will be used to just writing this in a HTML file,

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.940
opening up this file in the browser,

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.920
and everything just works.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.160
Well, this is a bit different when using WordPress because

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.155
WordPress needs a web server to run. Why is this?

00:00:22.155 --> 00:00:27.905
Well, this is because WordPress is wrote in a programming language called PHP.

00:00:27.905 --> 00:00:30.575
PHP will only run on the server,

00:00:30.575 --> 00:00:33.660
it doesn't work inside the browser.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.320
For WordPress, you don't need to understand any PHP course.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.990
Good understanding of PHP is running on the server,

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:45.410
is key to understanding how WordPress works.

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.505
If you consider a sites such as Facebook or Twitter,

00:00:49.505 --> 00:00:52.265
or generally any blog sites,

00:00:52.265 --> 00:00:55.190
chat application, or even social network,

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.710
they all look the same for every user,

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.230
but the details on the page are different.

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.940
Such as the username which will change your personal friends or connections,

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.120
your blog posts, and so on.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.175
We can think of things like Facebook and Twitter as

00:01:10.175 --> 00:01:14.855
a template and any details are injected in when needed,

00:01:14.855 --> 00:01:17.830
and these all based on the logged-in user.

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.880
This is an example of what PHP does,

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.960
it can generate a web page which change

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.770
the particular details for each user or each page.

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.645
This is an example of what is called a dynamic web page.

00:01:31.645 --> 00:01:33.660
It's on a web server,

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.330
where these pages are generated.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.880
On the server, it will have the template or the basic setup.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.780
Then it will place in all of the details which you pulls into the database,

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.115
such as a user, or the blog posts which we just mentioned before.

00:01:49.115 --> 00:01:52.715
You don't need to fully understand all of this at the moment,

00:01:52.715 --> 00:01:58.535
but just be aware that this is the reason why we need a web server to run WordPress,

00:01:58.535 --> 00:02:04.820
rather than just open it up inside the browser like we can do with a regular HTML page.

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:10.835
Unfortunately, we can set up a web server on our own computer to run this.

00:02:10.835 --> 00:02:13.835
Also, WordPress needs a database too,

00:02:13.835 --> 00:02:15.890
which is used to store all of the pages,

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.855
the blog posts, the images,

00:02:17.855 --> 00:02:20.350
and all the information which it needs.

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:23.180
It's this web server which we'll also talk about

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.725
the database and grab all this information for us.

00:02:26.725 --> 00:02:29.745
This now leaves us with some options.

00:02:29.745 --> 00:02:33.370
If you already have purchased some web hosting in the past,

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.045
which can run WordPress,

00:02:35.045 --> 00:02:38.120
you can, of course, use that for this course.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.035
Are we going to run through some of what is called local options,

00:02:42.035 --> 00:02:48.005
which is the ability to set up a web server locally on our own computer?

00:02:48.005 --> 00:02:50.120
There will be a couple of different options,

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.800
so make sure you just use one,

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.765
and I would recommend the next video if you will ensure.

00:02:55.765 --> 00:02:57.890
With this as a background,

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:03.000
we now going to run through how to set a WordPress in this next video.
