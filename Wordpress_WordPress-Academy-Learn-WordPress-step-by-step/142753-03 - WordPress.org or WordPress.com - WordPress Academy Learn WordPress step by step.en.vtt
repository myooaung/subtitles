00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.220
Let's begin with WordPress.org,

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.790
which is the homepage for the popular open source WordPress software.

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:14.625
Open source means anybody can use this or contribute to it free of charge.

00:00:14.625 --> 00:00:18.195
This is the site for the official WordPress software,

00:00:18.195 --> 00:00:22.470
which we are going to be using to create our project through out this course.

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:28.010
We download it, we can customize it and uploaded to a live server when complete.

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:33.940
It basically gives us the total flexibility since it's completely self hosted,

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:39.295
and also hosting costs for WordPress a relatively cheap when it first started out.

00:00:39.295 --> 00:00:41.960
At the top navigation of this page,

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:47.060
you can see here that we have the available plugins and themes which we can then use.

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.650
We'll make use of both of these throughout this course.

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.120
There is also a support section where we can

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.150
have full access to the WordPress documentation,

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.850
which we're going to refer to quite often, and of course,

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.430
everything we need from installing themes,

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.400
right through to security topics.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.495
The actual software is available from clicking on this get WordPress button,

00:01:09.495 --> 00:01:13.705
and this is one of the setup options which we're going to take a look at very soon.

00:01:13.705 --> 00:01:16.460
Download this software as mentioned will give us

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.110
the total flexibility and

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.925
control over everything we're going to do with our WordPress site,

00:01:21.925 --> 00:01:27.425
or there is an alternative which is available from Wordpress.com.

00:01:27.425 --> 00:01:29.945
Wordpress.com is more of

00:01:29.945 --> 00:01:34.990
a service which will allow us to have a WordPress site, posted photos.

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.705
It uses the same WordPress software which we just looked at,

00:01:38.705 --> 00:01:43.150
it takes away this setup and provides hosting for this software.

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.640
This site was created by one of the WordPress founders.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.240
For the ease of setup does come at a cost.

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.215
We don't have the flexibility we have when self-hosting.

00:01:54.215 --> 00:01:58.295
Under also by restrictions on which themes plugins we can use,

00:01:58.295 --> 00:02:01.910
depending on exactly which paid plan which you use.

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:06.520
With this in mind, if we click on a Plans and Pricing from the navigation,

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.130
there is various different price levels along with a free option,

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:11.705
which we can see at the top,

00:02:11.705 --> 00:02:14.675
is 3ca coming option when starting out.

00:02:14.675 --> 00:02:18.095
But it does also place advertising banners on your site,

00:02:18.095 --> 00:02:20.120
which you probably don't want.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.905
We then have options from a personal side right through to an e-commerce store.

00:02:24.905 --> 00:02:27.080
We can see these options in more detail,

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.235
if we scroll down to this table.

00:02:29.235 --> 00:02:31.340
As far as I mentioned, there is some restrictions,

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.160
as you can see here when using Wordpress.com,

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.590
and these restrictions are lifted as we go through higher pricing options.

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.835
WordPress.org is the one to go for if we want full control over our site,

00:02:43.835 --> 00:02:46.610
and we are happy to do a little set up work.

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.585
We're going to be choosing this path through out this course,

00:02:49.585 --> 00:02:52.460
or this site which is WordPress.com is

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.910
a good option if you want everything taken care of for you.

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.630
But remember there are restrictions unless you go for the more expensive plans.
