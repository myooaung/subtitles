X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=LOCAL:00:00:00.000,MPEGTS:0

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:08.985
Now I have this empty WordPress store which has the current default theme.

00:00:08.985 --> 00:00:12.135
To transform this into a e-commerce store,

00:00:12.135 --> 00:00:14.400
we're going to need some additional tools.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.450
After this we're going to take advantage of WooCommerce.

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.830
This is going to allow us to transform our sides in two ways.

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.790
First of all, we'll make use of the storefront theme,

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:28.370
which is a theme to transform the look and feel of

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:31.595
our site to be more like an e-commerce store.

00:00:31.595 --> 00:00:36.110
Second of all, by the same author we'll also have access to the WooCommerce plugin,

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.450
which will give us the functionality to transform

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.495
our WordPress site into an e-commerce store.

00:00:41.495 --> 00:00:44.120
It provides all the essential features which we need,

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.295
such as the ability to add products,

00:00:46.295 --> 00:00:48.235
to create shipping rates,

00:00:48.235 --> 00:00:51.290
add taxes, look after our inventory,

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:52.610
to manage our stock,

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.785
to integrate with payment providers and everything else which we're going to need.

00:00:56.785 --> 00:00:58.460
First of all, the theme,

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.275
if you go to the marketplace,

00:01:00.275 --> 00:01:02.465
then down to the theme's link and

00:01:02.465 --> 00:01:05.480
inside here we're going to make use of the storefront themes.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.700
There is also child themes available and we'll take

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.860
a look at what these are in the next video.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.740
Although we need the storefront framework and we can add

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.060
this just like the rest of our themes inside the dashboard.

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.075
But for now, we can take a quick look at what's included with this theme.

00:01:20.075 --> 00:01:22.715
It has pretty much everything which you would expect.

00:01:22.715 --> 00:01:27.785
It's fully responsive, which means our store will look great on all screen sizes.

00:01:27.785 --> 00:01:30.995
It integrates perfectly with the WooCommerce plug-in.

00:01:30.995 --> 00:01:32.765
It's search engine friendly,

00:01:32.765 --> 00:01:35.390
and it generally provides a great look and feel which we can

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.525
use as a good starting point for our project.

00:01:38.525 --> 00:01:41.630
As with all themes, it is also fully customizable.

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.215
We don't need to worry about being stuck with the exact default theme,

00:01:45.215 --> 00:01:47.390
as well as WooCommerce is own [inaudible].

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.980
It also integrates with the customizer so we can easily update all the brand in,

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:53.690
the colors, the look and feel,

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.455
and generally make it look exactly how I want to.

00:01:56.455 --> 00:01:59.660
WooCommerce has been around for a long time and it's well-developed,

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:04.985
and it also powers tens of thousands of e-commerce stores available online today.

00:02:04.985 --> 00:02:10.880
Let's go over to our dashboard and we can first start off by installing our theme into

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:17.640
appearance on the theme section on new and search for storefront.

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.700
This is a [inaudible] needed just here, install

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.225
and let's activate this and check this out on the front end.

00:02:37.225 --> 00:02:39.480
O2O sides and reload.

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.085
We can instantly see that we have a change to our theme.

00:02:43.085 --> 00:02:46.235
Currently all we have is our default homepage which shows

00:02:46.235 --> 00:02:50.470
our single blog posts and also this sample pages here.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.840
Currently it doesn't look much like an e-commerce store, but remember,

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.960
the purpose of the theme is just to change the look of our current content.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.190
At the moment, we don't have many pages,

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:02.670
we don't have many blog posts,

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.140
we don't have any products or anything like that setup.

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.930
This is something which the WooCommerce plugin is going to provide for us.

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.505
The second part, if you go back to the dashboard,

00:03:13.505 --> 00:03:17.390
is to install the plugin, press ''Add New''.

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.910
Let's do a search for WooCommerce.

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.230
This is what we need here by automatic and it recently

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:32.040
updated and also compatible with our version of WordPress.

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.050
This is going to give us our default pages.

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:42.970
It's going to give us all of the functionality which we'll need to get started.

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.790
If there is any extra functionality which is not included,

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.160
if we're looking for something specialist,

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:54.725
there's also many other third-party plugins too which we can integrate into our site.

00:03:54.725 --> 00:03:57.570
Good, let's activate this.

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.735
The first thing we see is we're taken through some installation steps.

00:04:02.735 --> 00:04:04.955
We could also skip this as well because

00:04:04.955 --> 00:04:07.730
all of these options are available from the dashboard.

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.945
I'm going to go through some simple setup steps.

00:04:10.945 --> 00:04:14.230
As well just add some dummy data.

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:17.180
We don't need to add our exact address at

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.505
the moment but what is beneficial is to also add the country.

00:04:21.505 --> 00:04:26.540
This is because this will let WooCommerce setup certain things based on our location,

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:31.280
such as the currency and also some shipping rates too.

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:39.170
After this continue or industry, these are still operates.

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:40.880
We are going to be creating Asia store,

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.905
so I'm going to click on ''Fashion''.

00:04:42.905 --> 00:04:45.380
Then we'll have a selection of different types of

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.050
products which we are going to be listing.

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.625
Then we can select what type of products we are going to be listing.

00:04:51.625 --> 00:04:54.875
Physical products are actual product which we're going to

00:04:54.875 --> 00:04:57.785
ship out to the customer at their location.

00:04:57.785 --> 00:05:00.555
We can have downloads which are virtual products,

00:05:00.555 --> 00:05:03.880
and then we'll also have various of options such as subscriptions,

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:08.350
memberships, bookings, bundles and also custom products too.

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:09.910
However, these are all chargeable,

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:14.975
but we only need the physical products for now. Continuing on.

00:05:14.975 --> 00:05:18.160
I'm going to say we don't have any products just yet and also we're not

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:22.455
selling elsewhere and let's uncheck all of these.

00:05:22.455 --> 00:05:26.210
We can also re-enable these later if we want to.

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:30.145
Like the theme, we're going to stick with the default storefront.

00:05:30.145 --> 00:05:35.000
We also have some access to different paid and also free themes too.

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:39.915
Now, we'll leave out jetpack but we can also re-enable this later on.

00:05:39.915 --> 00:05:43.370
Once we're done, we're then taken back to the dashboard.

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:47.300
As with most plugins, this also gives us lots of settings inside the dashboard.

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:49.520
We can manage our orders, our customers,

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.800
our coupons and various other settings

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.470
which we're going to go through during this project.

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:57.700
We also have a dedicated product option two.

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:01.985
Now this is enabled. Let's go back over to our front-end and refresh.

00:06:01.985 --> 00:06:05.855
Instantly we can see we have some more pages added to our menu.

00:06:05.855 --> 00:06:07.810
We have a shopping cart.

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:11.855
We have not yet added any products to these cart, so this is empty.

00:06:11.855 --> 00:06:14.695
We also have a dedicated a checkout page.

00:06:14.695 --> 00:06:18.860
There's a customer account page where we can see things such as our previous orders.

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:22.655
We can download any virtual products which we purchased.

00:06:22.655 --> 00:06:24.230
We can manage our addresses,

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:28.115
our account details and edit any of these options as we need to.

00:06:28.115 --> 00:06:30.620
Finally, we also have the shop option.

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:33.140
We don't currently have any products inside here.

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:37.280
What we're going to do to give us a quick start is to add some sample data.

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:42.125
This is just to things such as various products to get us started with our store.

00:06:42.125 --> 00:06:45.860
Of course, we will take a look at how to add these manually, but for now,

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:50.135
we're going to go over to the dashboard into the tool section.

00:06:50.135 --> 00:06:52.300
Then we can import our data.

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:54.830
This will use the WordPress importer.

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:58.280
Since this is the first time we're going to be running the WordPress importer.

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:02.015
We need to install this and then click on ''Run''.

00:07:02.015 --> 00:07:05.840
Here all we need to do is to choose our file which contains

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:10.695
our sample data and then head to the location of your local project.

00:07:10.695 --> 00:07:14.000
Mine is in my user area and then into local sites,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.765
into the shirtstore, into app and then public.

00:07:17.765 --> 00:07:21.545
Then from here we need to go into the content and the plugin section.

00:07:21.545 --> 00:07:24.800
The plugins at the moment contains our Wordpress importer,

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:28.265
which we commonly use in and also our WooCommerce plugin.

00:07:28.265 --> 00:07:31.070
This has a sample data folder which contains

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:34.630
this XML file which we need to import our data.

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:36.410
If you are using mum for this,

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:40.085
you will need to go into the mum folder and then into the HD docs,

00:07:40.085 --> 00:07:42.260
and then into your share store projects.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:45.040
With this now selected, let's upload this.

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:48.815
Because WooCommerce is creating things such as products for us,

00:07:48.815 --> 00:07:51.820
we also need to add a author or a creator.

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:54.980
We can create a new one or can use our shirtstore,

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:56.765
which we have previously setup.

00:07:56.765 --> 00:08:00.830
Click on the import file attachments and then submit.

00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:04.230
Good, we now do, we can click on

00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:07.540
this product's link and we can see what data has been included.

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:10.265
I have lots of different products with our images,

00:08:10.265 --> 00:08:11.960
we have our stock keeping units,

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:13.550
which is the product code.

00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:15.200
We have the in stock flag,

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:17.120
we have a price, the categories.

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:18.835
We can also add tags.

00:08:18.835 --> 00:08:21.500
Also with the store, we can feature all products to

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:24.590
appear on the front page of its website,

00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:26.465
on the front-end refresh.

00:08:26.465 --> 00:08:28.280
Now because we are on the shop link,

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:31.270
we can see all of these products and now displays.

00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:33.420
Automatically we have the buttons,

00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:35.690
you add any of these products to our cart.

00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:38.780
We can then view our carts and see all of the products which you've added.

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:41.030
We can amend the details, the quantity.

00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:42.860
We can apply different coupons.

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:44.210
We also have a checkout page.

00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:45.980
We can go through to the user,

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:47.420
can add all of the billing details.

00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:49.585
We can see an overview of the order.

00:08:49.585 --> 00:08:54.640
Currently we don't have any payment methods available because we haven't set any up yet.

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:57.200
We will fix this in a later video.

00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:00.110
Each one of these products, if we go back to the shop,

00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:02.280
also has a product detail page.

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:04.320
We can click on these to be taken through

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:07.945
full detail view where we can zoom in on the image.

00:09:07.945 --> 00:09:11.030
We have extended descriptions, additional information.

00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:13.145
We can see any previous reviews.

00:09:13.145 --> 00:09:15.020
Also when we set these products up,

00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:17.755
we can link these two related products too.

00:09:17.755 --> 00:09:21.525
This will allow us to provide upselling and cross-selling too.

00:09:21.525 --> 00:09:23.870
Great, this is now our theme and also

00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:27.685
our WooCommerce functionality all included with the plugin.

00:09:27.685 --> 00:09:30.049
Also just as a quick side note too,

00:09:30.049 --> 00:09:32.645
automatic which creates the WooCommerce plugin,

00:09:32.645 --> 00:09:35.735
is also the original creator of WordPress too.

00:09:35.735 --> 00:09:38.620
We're in good hands by using this plugin.

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:41.090
Next we're going to take a look at how we can use

00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:46.140
child themes and why this are really important for WordPress sites.
