00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:06.015
If all of the care in the world,

00:00:06.015 --> 00:00:09.340
things can and do go wrong when dealing with technology.

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:13.170
If the worst was to happen and we lost all of our website data,

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.645
we want to make sure that all of our hard work is not lost.

00:00:16.645 --> 00:00:19.545
We could spend hours, days, weeks,

00:00:19.545 --> 00:00:21.840
years creating lots of different content,

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.070
lots of blog posts,

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.485
and we don't want all this to be lost.

00:00:25.485 --> 00:00:30.930
It makes sense to cover this possibility by creating backups of our websites.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.350
We have lots of great plugins available to do this easily.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.630
There really is no excuse not to.

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.230
While this use case, we're also going to make use of another plugin.

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.340
Log out the plugin section and go down to the Add New,

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.920
search for the one which we are going to be using, which is BackWPup.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.935
This is the one I'm going to be using,

00:00:52.935 --> 00:01:02.055
so click on "Install" and activate this once downloaded.

00:01:02.055 --> 00:01:05.310
Here we also have this BackWPup section.

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:06.590
If we click on this icon,

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.070
we can then go to the steps inside of this section.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.490
The first step is to check the installation,

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.020
which will then take us to a settings page.

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:22.240
You can see all of the information about our site and also the results of various tests.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.215
Everything seems to be fine inside of this section.

00:01:25.215 --> 00:01:28.350
Also if we do have any issues with this plugin,

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.135
we need to contact the BackWPup support.

00:01:31.135 --> 00:01:35.285
We can also click this button just here to get all of this debug information,

00:01:35.285 --> 00:01:37.955
which we can also send without question.

00:01:37.955 --> 00:01:40.700
Everything is fine here. We don't see any problems.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.405
Then we can see all of the different terms which we have at the top.

00:01:44.405 --> 00:01:47.045
Most of these can be left as default.

00:01:47.045 --> 00:01:50.885
But we can also change things to change the maximum number of log files,

00:01:50.885 --> 00:01:53.260
which is inside the logs tab.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.750
This means we'll only save a maximum of 30 backup files.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.595
We can also choose to compress these, if you want to.

00:02:00.595 --> 00:02:04.310
From here, we can also select where we want these backups to be placed.

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.520
Then we have the default location which is inside of

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.055
our projects into the WP Content folder.

00:02:11.055 --> 00:02:16.055
Then from here, we can select exactly which folder we want to store this inside.

00:02:16.055 --> 00:02:20.015
Here we can see we are saving these inside of an uploads folder.

00:02:20.015 --> 00:02:21.770
I want to leave this as standard,

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.855
but you can change this if you want to.

00:02:23.855 --> 00:02:26.700
Next back over to the dashboard,

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.575
we'll then need to go to step 2,

00:02:28.575 --> 00:02:31.370
which is to actually create a backup job.

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.545
First, we give his job a name,

00:02:33.545 --> 00:02:36.770
we want to call this the Weekly Backup.

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:41.725
Then we can select exactly which pieces of information we want to backup.

00:02:41.725 --> 00:02:44.450
We want to backup the database in all of our files,

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.680
and also a list of any plugins which were installed too.

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.925
By default, we don't have the XML exports or the database tables checked.

00:02:52.925 --> 00:02:57.220
This is fine. Then we can select how we want to name our new file.

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.285
The default button for our saved files is going to be the year,

00:03:01.285 --> 00:03:03.250
the month, the day,

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.795
the hour in 24-hour format.

00:03:05.795 --> 00:03:09.625
The lowercase i, which is the representation of the minute.

00:03:09.625 --> 00:03:12.595
Then the lowercase s, which is the seconds.

00:03:12.595 --> 00:03:15.200
You could play around with this file name if you wanted to,

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.665
but it's already saved in a sensible format.

00:03:17.665 --> 00:03:19.685
I'm going to leave this as it is.

00:03:19.685 --> 00:03:21.750
The zip file is fine.

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.600
I'm going to back this up to the uploads folder which we've seen before.

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.800
But if you wanted to, you could back this up in different locations such as Dropbox.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.930
You could be sent an email with the backup,

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.910
and also various Cloud services which you see here, see this?

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.500
Next we have the Schedule tab.

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.855
From here we're going to schedule exactly when we want this backup to take place.

00:03:44.855 --> 00:03:48.230
We could not schedule it at all and just leave this as manual.

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.940
We need to set this off manually or we're going to use a WordPress Chrome.

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.150
This will allow us to schedule a particular day or

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:00.210
time when we want these backup to take place, it's almost weekly.

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:02.765
We can also set the day we want this to happen.

00:04:02.765 --> 00:04:05.330
Also the hour and the minute too,

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:06.740
Sunday morning is fine by me,

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:08.885
so save our changes.

00:04:08.885 --> 00:04:11.840
Then next we have the DB backup.

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.590
Here we can select exactly which database tables we want to backup.

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:18.620
Currently, all of our database tables are selected.

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:23.225
But you can uncheck any of these if you don't want to include these with the backup,

00:04:23.225 --> 00:04:26.285
if you are unsure, just leave these as they are.

00:04:26.285 --> 00:04:28.415
We have the Files tab next.

00:04:28.415 --> 00:04:30.440
From here, we can choose to exclude

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.215
any files which we don't want to include in the backup.

00:04:33.215 --> 00:04:36.485
For example, if you have various plugins which you don't want a backup,

00:04:36.485 --> 00:04:38.975
we can check these to exclude any of these.

00:04:38.975 --> 00:04:43.710
If we have some themes which we are not using such as the 2019 one.

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.800
We could also check any of these to exclude these from

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.750
the backups along with any old content from previous years,

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.530
we can also exclude any of this data too.

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:54.000
Next, we have the plugins,

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.010
where all we can do inside here is change

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:00.735
the file name and also add file compression if we wanted to.

00:05:00.735 --> 00:05:02.970
To Folder, we've already dealt with,

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.410
this is the location where all backups will be saved.

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:09.910
We can also change the number of files to keep in this folder too.

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:11.695
If you've made any changes,

00:05:11.695 --> 00:05:14.970
hit "Save", back to the dashboard.

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:20.125
Next, we're going to actually run the created job. Click on step 3.

00:05:20.125 --> 00:05:22.600
This will then take us to the Jobs tab,

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.050
where we can see our weekly backup.

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:27.095
Over this, we can edit this,

00:05:27.095 --> 00:05:30.120
and we can also run this backup immediately.

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.950
Click on this and then give us

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:37.070
a few moments to run through our first backup for our site.

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:40.740
Once this hits 100 percent and this is finished,

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.330
we can see when this was last run.

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:45.745
We can also see the date for the next run too.

00:05:45.745 --> 00:05:47.470
If you want to check if this has worked,

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:51.635
we can head into local. Let's open it up.

00:05:51.635 --> 00:05:54.885
Bring up the main admin and from this button,

00:05:54.885 --> 00:05:58.380
just on here, we can go into our saved files and folders.

00:05:58.380 --> 00:05:59.800
Inside of our project,

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.690
we need to go into the app, public.

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:04.570
As we've seen from the file location,

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:06.805
this is inside of the WP Content,

00:06:06.805 --> 00:06:09.670
and we created this upload folder just here,

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:14.380
and into here, then we can see a list of all of our content which has been saved.

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:16.045
If we go into here,

00:06:16.045 --> 00:06:19.420
this is all of the content such as our background images,

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:21.415
our headers, our logo.

00:06:21.415 --> 00:06:24.740
This is all of the file content now saved.

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:29.210
Along with this, we see the logs and then if we go into the backups folder,

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:31.700
we see we have one single backup.

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:37.025
We can also see this if we go back to the dashboard and click on the backups option,

00:06:37.025 --> 00:06:41.105
there's confirmation of our first backup which we just created.

00:06:41.105 --> 00:06:45.660
We could also delete or download this if we want to.

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:49.190
As you can imagine, backing up your WordPress site is really important.

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:52.090
This is one easy way of doing it with this plugin.

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:55.520
This is now the end of this project and also this section,

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:58.175
so I'll now see you in the upcoming section

00:06:58.175 --> 00:07:01.920
where we want to learn all about WordPress e-commerce.
