00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:06.210
Welcome back. Now we're going to concentrate on our individual blog posts

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.825
and how to get them work in inside a WordPress.

00:00:09.825 --> 00:00:16.440
First of all, we're going to create a couple of new blog posts to be working with.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.630
Add a new blog post,

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.900
so new post wall.

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:28.210
Let's grab some Lorem Ipsum.

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:38.980
I want to generate five photographs and I copy all this.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.920
Then add this into our post.

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:49.470
I'll also grab a featured image.

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.020
I grab up on from our project,

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.040
inside the images folder.

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:05.380
I'll be fine and actually struck one or two more inside that for later use.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:13.450
Set the featured image and then publish.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.040
If we go over to Visit Sites, check out the blog.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.230
You'll notice that the blog post that we just

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:28.595
created has now been included at the top of our blog.

00:01:28.595 --> 00:01:34.055
However, it doesn't look like our blog inside the finish website,

00:01:34.055 --> 00:01:38.090
which is just like this. Let's change this now.

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:44.185
If we go back over to the index.php and within the loop section,

00:01:44.185 --> 00:01:49.295
you can see that the loop is pulling a template called content.

00:01:49.295 --> 00:01:54.640
This is the template which contains all the information about the blog post.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.340
Go into your directory,

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.710
and then look for a folder called template parts.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:08.610
Then inside there, open up the content.php.

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:14.145
We can see this is the template part for displaying posts.

00:02:14.145 --> 00:02:19.610
This is one we need to work with to make it look more like our finish website.

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.295
I'm going to clean this up a little.

00:02:22.295 --> 00:02:25.370
First of all, I'm going to remove the header.

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.030
Delete the opening on the closing tag.

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.350
I'm going to scroll down and delete

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:41.795
the full entry content section and also the entry footer section.

00:02:41.795 --> 00:02:44.640
We should remove that,

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:52.105
so we can delete all those sections and I would just add our own content as we need it.

00:02:52.105 --> 00:02:58.325
In fact, we can just remove this entry meta type two. Delete that.

00:02:58.325 --> 00:03:01.855
Let's save that and then if we refresh,

00:03:01.855 --> 00:03:06.755
we should find that all the content is being removed except the title.

00:03:06.755 --> 00:03:12.490
Let's fix this now by going over to our static website from the desktop,

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:18.010
go to the blog and then go down to our blog posts.

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:25.790
If you locate the div with the class of blog post and then copy this full section.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:35.530
I go back over to our WordPress theme and I paste in just after the if statement.

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:41.560
Save that and then refresh the blog page.

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:50.150
The first thing you'll notice is the blog post has two different blog post titles.

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.745
One which WordPress has generated,

00:03:52.745 --> 00:03:59.050
and one from our blog section that we just copied over. Let's fix this now.

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:03.605
The WordPress generated one is open at the top.

00:04:03.605 --> 00:04:06.125
There's a if else statements,

00:04:06.125 --> 00:04:09.700
which is displaying the blog post title.

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:15.260
First of all, we're checking if the page is single and this means if the blog post has

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:21.050
being clicked on and linked through to the full post and if it has,

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:26.370
it's going to display the page title with a level 1 heading.

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.970
All of the pages will have the title displayed as a level 2.

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:40.890
To match our website, won't change the level 1 heading to be level 2 and also close off.

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:43.955
For all of the pages,

00:04:43.955 --> 00:04:49.790
I'm going to change this to be level 3 heading which matches our blog post,

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:52.320
which you can see it is down here.

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.995
Now, WordPress is generating our blog title.

00:04:56.995 --> 00:04:58.795
We can just delete our own.

00:04:58.795 --> 00:05:04.340
Remove that from that and then visit the blog and refresh.

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:10.335
Now, we just got the New Post 1 title.

00:05:10.335 --> 00:05:16.465
As you can see, we don't have the image displayed that we set as the featured image.

00:05:16.465 --> 00:05:18.730
We still got the placeholder image,

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:22.530
so let's go to content.php.

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:24.750
Over in the content,

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:30.865
let's leave the placehold image and then replace this with a WordPress function.

00:05:30.865 --> 00:05:36.020
Open up the php and then the function we need,

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:37.890
it's called the post thumbnail.

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:48.405
So theme_ post _ thumbnail and hit Save.

00:05:48.405 --> 00:05:51.315
Then now if we refresh the blog,

00:05:51.315 --> 00:05:54.910
we'll get displayed the featured image.

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:59.760
Now let's get to work on added WordPress functions,

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:03.790
display the author, the number of comments,

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:07.140
and also the date the post was created.

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:12.150
Between the p tags,

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:14.305
let's just delete all the texts.

00:06:14.305 --> 00:06:17.510
I will replace this with a WordPress function.

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:19.730
Open up the php.

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:22.595
We need to include the excerpt.

00:06:22.595 --> 00:06:27.515
This is the shown version of the full content,

00:06:27.515 --> 00:06:30.890
which is just going to be displayed below the image.

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:35.700
Now, there's the shortened version of the Lorem Ipsum text.

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:39.870
Next let's replace the author,

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:42.570
so delete the authors name,

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:45.790
open up the php tags,

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:49.875
and this one is simply the_author();

00:06:49.875 --> 00:06:57.940
and then refresh data.

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:00.190
Now after the author,

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:02.345
we've got the proheadphones-admin,

00:07:02.345 --> 00:07:05.790
which is the creator of this blog post,

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:10.995
and then next the number of comments.

00:07:10.995 --> 00:07:14.415
So again, open up the php tags,

00:07:14.415 --> 00:07:16.500
opening and closing tags.

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:20.000
This one is called by the function called comments number.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:31.830
Comments_number(); So save that, refresh.

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:35.070
There we go. There's no comments on this post,

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:37.325
but the example Hello World one,

00:07:37.325 --> 00:07:41.520
which is included with WordPress, has one comment.

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:46.780
Then lastly, let's make the date dynamic.

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:49.320
So we can leave the posted on text,

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:54.410
but let's just add a php function straight after that.

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:59.450
In fact, lets put on a new line so it's more clear.

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:04.970
I want to echo get the dates.

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:09.160
But this time inside the brackets,

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:13.720
we're going to add some parameters to make sure that the data is displayed in

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:19.340
the correct format and then inside the brackets I'm going to add a capital F,

00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:30.285
a small j, and then a comma and a capital Y and you see Y when we refresh the page.

00:08:30.285 --> 00:08:32.955
Now, we'll copy the dates.

00:08:32.955 --> 00:08:35.625
The capital F left was for the month,

00:08:35.625 --> 00:08:40.200
the small j is a php way of including the day,

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:47.200
and then a comma and then a capital Y was the year in the four-digit format.

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:50.345
If you're interested in different php date formats,

00:08:50.345 --> 00:08:53.600
a quick Google will pull up all the different letters that you can use.

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:55.965
There are different date formats.

00:08:55.965 --> 00:08:58.035
Now hope all is working.

00:08:58.035 --> 00:09:04.030
I was going to add two more blog posts just to check they're all working.

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:13.390
New Post 2, let's copy over the sample text,

00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:21.390
a featured image, and then

00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:28.480
publish, and then one more

00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:45.040
and then let's visit the blog.

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:52.335
Hopefully when we scroll down,

00:09:52.335 --> 00:09:54.810
there's our new post 3,

00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:59.925
our new post 2, and the original one which we created.

00:09:59.925 --> 00:10:03.680
That's just finished now for the blog exempt section,

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:05.310
you can do so much more such as,

00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:07.520
adding WordPress functions to display

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:12.770
the categories or the tags associated with each post.

00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:15.740
All it takes is a quick Google search or check

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:19.085
out the WordPress codecs to find out how to do it.

00:10:19.085 --> 00:10:21.545
Now, let's move on to the next video.

00:10:21.545 --> 00:10:24.210
We'll take a look at this sidebar.
