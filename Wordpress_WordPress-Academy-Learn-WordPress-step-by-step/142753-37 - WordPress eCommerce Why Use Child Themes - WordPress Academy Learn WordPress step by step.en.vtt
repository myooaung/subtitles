00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:06.690
Just before we get to work with making changes for new e-commerce store,

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.160
we're first going to take a look at what a child and also a Parent Theme is.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.790
So far, we've been using what's called a Parent Theme.

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.840
This is a complete theme which we've been using in our previous projects,

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.375
and also this storefront theme too.

00:00:21.375 --> 00:00:24.600
It was kind of like a main or a top-level theme.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.730
On the other hand, a child theme is a sub-theme which is based on a parent.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.715
Any current parent theme such as our staff runs,

00:00:32.715 --> 00:00:35.370
can be used as a base or a starting point.

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.260
Then we can create a Child Theme which is going to inherit

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.915
all of the styling and functionality from his parents.

00:00:41.915 --> 00:00:44.360
We are effectively selecting a theme,

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:45.830
branching off this theme,

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:48.965
and then it creating all changes to this new version.

00:00:48.965 --> 00:00:51.290
But why would we want to do this rather than making

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.230
all changes to this main parent theme?

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.305
Well, is various different reasons why we want to do this,

00:00:57.305 --> 00:01:02.210
and probably the most important reason is to preserve the original theme.

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:03.920
If you make changes throughout theme from

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.740
the dashboard using tools such as the customizer,

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.100
changeable layout, changeable color schemes or menus,

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.110
this is all completely fine.

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.005
All this dashboard tools such as the customizer,

00:01:15.005 --> 00:01:20.140
is a safe and approved way to edit and update the look and feel of our theme.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.215
However though, if we want to go even deeper and go into our themes folder,

00:01:24.215 --> 00:01:25.640
we could add new files,

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:26.750
we could add new template,

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.760
we could update existing ones,

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.175
and generally make more extensive changes.

00:01:31.175 --> 00:01:34.175
We do want to do this in a Child Theme.

00:01:34.175 --> 00:01:37.565
If you were to make any of these changes in the parent theme,

00:01:37.565 --> 00:01:39.500
it would still work completely fine.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.720
However though the problem arises,

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.750
when we need to update this theme.

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.090
If the themes offer create a new update and new security release,

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.170
where generally makes any changes to the parent theme.

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.420
Once we download this new version,

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.565
all of our changes will be lost.

00:01:55.565 --> 00:01:59.840
However, though if we are using this theme as a template or a starting point,

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.570
we can then make our changes to our child theme,

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.390
and then we can safely update the parents.

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.110
This also has many of a benefit too.

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.785
For example, it's a good way to get a head start on creating our theme.

00:02:11.785 --> 00:02:16.520
We cannot make use of all of the tried and tested work from a proven theme.

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.600
Then we can branch off it and create our own version based off this.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.140
It also allows us to organize our code better since we know

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.965
exactly where all of our own custom changes will be stored.

00:02:27.965 --> 00:02:30.230
Also, if we wanted to, we could also create

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.925
a different child theme based on this child theme too.

00:02:33.925 --> 00:02:37.700
Generally, if we are making any extensive changes to our theme,

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.595
including any changes inside the files and folders.

00:02:40.595 --> 00:02:44.345
We do want to make a child theme to make this much safer.

00:02:44.345 --> 00:02:47.430
This is why we need a child theme.

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:53.070
Next, we'll take a look how to set up a child theme for our current project.
