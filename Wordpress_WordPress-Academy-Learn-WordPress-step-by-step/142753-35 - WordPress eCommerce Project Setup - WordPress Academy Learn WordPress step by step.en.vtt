00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:05.040
Here we go with our next project,

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.680
and this one is going to be an e-commerce store.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.955
To begin with this, I'm going to create our new site using local.

00:00:11.955 --> 00:00:14.205
Click on the "Plus" icon in the bottom,

00:00:14.205 --> 00:00:18.530
and I'm going to give this the site name of shirtstore.

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:21.660
Also remember, if you are using [inaudible] set up

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.845
the project with the exact same instructions as we did previously.

00:00:25.845 --> 00:00:29.130
But I want to proceed with using local.

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.639
Click on "Continue" with the preferred settings,

00:00:32.639 --> 00:00:34.470
then the username and password,

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.835
which we're going to use to login to our admin of mine.

00:00:38.835 --> 00:00:41.805
Mine is going to be the shirtstore_admin.

00:00:41.805 --> 00:00:47.435
The password. You can use the same emails and passwords as you use in previous project.

00:00:47.435 --> 00:00:50.360
This is completely fine and it will still allow you to login

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.655
to this new projects at the site.

00:00:53.655 --> 00:00:55.965
Also if using a MAC like previously,

00:00:55.965 --> 00:01:00.480
you may also need to add a password to complete the installation.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.845
Good, we're all done, and we can see our site is up and running,

00:01:10.845 --> 00:01:13.335
and just like in previous projects we can click on the

00:01:13.335 --> 00:01:16.290
"Admin" to be taken to the back-end of our site.

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.280
We see shirtstore admin and also the password.

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.245
Again, and this is all fine.

00:01:25.245 --> 00:01:31.155
We can also click on "Open Site" and take a look at the front-end of our default project.

00:01:31.155 --> 00:01:33.260
This is what we're going to do in this video.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.460
We have our site on our setup.

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.200
In the next video, we're going to introduce WooCommerce to

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.100
begin to transform our WordPress site into an e-commerce store.
