00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:04.259
If using the SiteGround web hosting,

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.185
once you finished one of the projects on this course,

00:00:07.185 --> 00:00:09.120
and need to move onto the next one;

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.380
an easy way to do this,

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.780
is to create a new URL.

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.839
At the moment, if you go to "My Accounts"

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.305
you'll probably only see one link to your website.

00:00:19.305 --> 00:00:21.390
We can add a second one.

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.300
If you go to "Add Installation Manually",

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.055
and we can start a new project.

00:00:27.055 --> 00:00:32.845
All we need to do is to click on the "WordPress Script" and then click on "Install".

00:00:32.845 --> 00:00:35.640
Rather than this, installing immediately,

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.380
it gives us a option to change the installation URL.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.140
It defaults to our current URL.

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.795
We can add a directory at the end.

00:00:44.795 --> 00:00:48.350
Inside here we can add the name of our new projects.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.175
If we want proheadphones,

00:00:51.175 --> 00:00:53.565
we can add this in here.

00:00:53.565 --> 00:00:56.915
We can scroll down and we can create a new admin,

00:00:56.915 --> 00:01:02.830
add a username, and also a password.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.675
All we need to do is scroll down to the bottom and click on "Install."

00:01:07.675 --> 00:01:14.039
This will then just take a few moments to install the new sites on the chosen URL.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.910
Once this is complete,

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:22.055
we now get a new URL which you can click on and also the admin link too.

00:01:22.055 --> 00:01:25.090
If we click on "My Accounts" once more,

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.080
we also see the new link and the link to the admin panel on here too.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.370
We can click on this. I'm going to open this up into a new tab.

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:39.570
It's now gives us a blank canvas to begin our next project.
