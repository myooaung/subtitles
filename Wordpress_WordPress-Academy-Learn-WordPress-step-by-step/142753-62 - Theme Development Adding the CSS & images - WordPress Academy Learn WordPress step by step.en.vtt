00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:08.220
Welcome back, guys. We've now got the header and

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.910
the footer area now into our WordPress theme.

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.985
They don't look much like the finished website.

00:00:14.985 --> 00:00:18.510
This is because we need to bring over the CSS

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.145
and also the images folder from our website template.

00:00:23.145 --> 00:00:27.910
Let's begin by opening up the folders.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.170
I'm going two open up to found the windows.

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.890
So this first one on the left is

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.990
the static website template and I'll open up one more window.

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.930
I'm going to open up the WordPress theme from the htdocs.

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.300
Let's go down and look for MAMP,

00:00:51.300 --> 00:01:01.480
htdocs, pro-headphones, and then inside the content, the themes.

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.880
Okay, so the first thing I want to do is to bring over

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.705
the CSS folder into our theme folder.

00:01:13.705 --> 00:01:19.610
Just copy and then paste this into our theme,

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.630
and then while we're in there, we can also do the same for the images folder.

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.120
Copy and paste or drag those over.

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.400
It can get to work, include these into our theme.

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.445
So first of all, I'm going to go to Google,

00:01:38.445 --> 00:01:46.490
and then I'm going to do a search for WordPress, including CSS, JavaScript.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.640
What we need is the WordPress developer website,

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.210
which is included in CSS and JavaScript.

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.835
Let's take a look at this page.

00:01:58.835 --> 00:02:03.310
This page of the WordPress site will give you all the information that you

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.410
need to include CSS and JavaScript into your theme.

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.965
If we scroll down a little bit further.

00:02:10.965 --> 00:02:15.695
We're looking for the combining enqueue functions.

00:02:15.695 --> 00:02:20.010
This is going to give us a demonstration of how we can add

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:27.060
stylesheets and also how we can add JavaScript files in one single function.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.720
Normally need to either copy this section or type out,

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.850
just like we did in the last project,

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.370
and then add it to our functions file.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.700
But because we're using the underscore starter theme,

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.350
this has already been included in the functions.php file.

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:48.420
That's already there photos.

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:56.315
You may be wondering why we need to enqueue scripts and also enqueue stylesheets,

00:02:56.315 --> 00:03:00.005
rather than just add them in the head or the photo section,

00:03:00.005 --> 00:03:02.809
like we do with normal HTML websites.

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:05.510
Well, the reason we do that, is because

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.945
WordPress deals with many different themes and plug-ins.

00:03:08.945 --> 00:03:14.810
It makes sure that all the required scripts and styles are loaded as and when required.

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.460
So there's no conflicts between different plugins,

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:22.580
and it basically just loads in a weigh that everything works together,

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.260
rather than different scripts fighting against each other.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.435
Let's head over to our function.php file,

00:03:30.435 --> 00:03:39.450
which is just in there, and the function we need is located towards the bottom.

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:47.050
This is what we need. We take look for function pro_headphones_wp_scripts.

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:52.020
This is the function to enqueue the scripts and also the styles.

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:55.335
Let's take a look at what's going on.

00:03:55.335 --> 00:03:59.940
First of all, we've got a wp_enqueue_style function.

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.805
This is pulling in our stylesheet,

00:04:02.805 --> 00:04:05.700
which is located just there.

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.340
This is the style.css.

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:14.080
This is gotten in by calling the get_stylesheet_uri function.

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.695
It's done in enqueue_script.

00:04:17.695 --> 00:04:21.550
The script is in enqueue, is in the js folder,

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:28.520
which is just underscore provides a couple of JavaScript files to get started.

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.590
One for the navigation,

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:35.665
and then a second file called skip-link-focus-fix.

00:04:35.665 --> 00:04:41.350
This is the file which helps with accessibility for keyboard users.

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:47.910
We're going to work with our stylesheet next.

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:54.865
As I mentioned before, we've got the style.css file being included by default.

00:04:54.865 --> 00:04:58.119
Let's grab all our custom CSS,

00:04:58.119 --> 00:05:01.565
that we've included in our CSS folder,

00:05:01.565 --> 00:05:06.170
and then go to our custom.css.

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:08.635
These are all the custom styles,

00:05:08.635 --> 00:05:11.990
which have been provided for the headphones website.

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:16.590
I'm just going to Select All, and then Copy,

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:22.185
and then go down to the style.css,

00:05:22.185 --> 00:05:26.260
and then I'm going to add these right at the very bottom.

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:35.280
I just scroll down and then add these into the bottom.

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:40.670
In fact, we'll just add a comment.

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:50.080
We just copy this comment section and paste this in before other custom styles.

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:57.570
Custom styles, and then save that.

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:01.955
As we've just seen, there is already quite a lot of styles,

00:06:01.955 --> 00:06:06.380
which had been included by default with the underscores theme.

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:10.570
A lot of these styles are useful to begin with.

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:13.405
But of course, if there is any styles which have been added,

00:06:13.405 --> 00:06:15.145
which conflict with your theme,

00:06:15.145 --> 00:06:17.870
feel free just to remove any of these.

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:20.070
Well, I'm just going to save that,

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:24.135
and then go over and refresh our theme.

00:06:24.135 --> 00:06:26.840
Now, you can see that there's been some changes.

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:30.060
We've now got the dark footer area

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:36.020
and also a little bit of styling to the other areas of the website.

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:40.555
You can seen our custom styles have been taken into effect.

00:06:40.555 --> 00:06:45.945
Now, the custom styles have been copied into the style.css.

00:06:45.945 --> 00:06:49.730
We can actually just delete this custom style from

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:54.270
our CSS folder because that's no longer needed.

00:06:54.430 --> 00:07:00.275
We notice that inside the CSS folder that we just copied over into our theme.

00:07:00.275 --> 00:07:02.960
There is more than one CSS file.

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:07.375
Now we need to get to work with linking all the rest of the stylesheets.

00:07:07.375 --> 00:07:11.165
The stylesheets for the foundation framework,

00:07:11.165 --> 00:07:14.030
that we've included with the static website.

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:21.840
Also, stylesheets for the foundation icons, which we've also used.

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:26.920
Let's add these links now in the functions.php.

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:34.075
We add these in by duplicating the wp_enqueue_style function.

00:07:34.075 --> 00:07:40.280
I'm going to duplicate this and separate it, so it's more clear.

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:44.395
I'm going to work with the top one because the bottom one,

00:07:44.395 --> 00:07:46.480
just like when we're working with HTML,

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:51.505
needs to be our custom stylesheets so they need to be in the correct order.

00:07:51.505 --> 00:07:57.280
The top one is going to be for our foundation CSS.

00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:04.340
Let's give this a unique name "foundation CSS",

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:07.495
and then we need to add the file path.

00:08:07.495 --> 00:08:13.390
So the get_stylesheet_ uri refers to the main template directory,

00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:17.395
which has the style.css but in our case we've got

00:08:17.395 --> 00:08:23.995
a separate CSS folder so we just need to concatenate or add-on to the end,

00:08:23.995 --> 00:08:25.720
the rest of the link.

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:28.510
So the "dot" to add this on,

00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:31.940
then open up the quotations,

00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:41.350
"/css/foundation.css" and it should

00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:47.660
take those inside the CSS folder and then link to the foundation.css file.

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:53.930
Next we're going to duplicate this two more times,

00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:56.845
and we'll just separate these out.

00:08:56.845 --> 00:09:00.820
Next, we need to add the "app.css".

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:06.160
So we just change the name to app.css.

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:08.665
Again it's in the CSS folder,

00:09:08.665 --> 00:09:11.365
but we just need to change this to "app".

00:09:11.365 --> 00:09:16.610
Then the third one is for the foundation icons.

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:23.930
So the ones we want to add is the "foundation-icons.css".

00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:30.620
So we change the name to be "icons",

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:33.610
and the CSS folder.

00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:38.180
This time there's a subfolder called "foundation-icons/foundation-icons.css"

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:51.655
and save that. Actually, just one thing we need to

00:09:51.655 --> 00:09:56.275
do first is [inaudible] the "stylesheet_uri",

00:09:56.275 --> 00:09:58.870
which we used as the main stylesheet,

00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:08.450
which needs changes to "get template directory", so "template_directory_uri".

00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:20.260
So just copy that and replace all three. Paste those in.

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:25.960
This "get_template_directory_uri" takes us to the main roots of the theme,

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:28.465
and then we just add on the extension.

00:10:28.465 --> 00:10:30.820
This takes us to the correct file.

00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:35.185
Let's save and then hit "Refresh".

00:10:35.185 --> 00:10:38.035
Now that looks a little bit better.

00:10:38.035 --> 00:10:42.565
You can see that some of the custom styling has been added in.

00:10:42.565 --> 00:10:46.370
Those are the links for the icons at the bottom.

00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:52.570
Also if we go into the developer tools,

00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:55.795
right-click and "Inspect" if you are using Chrome.

00:10:55.795 --> 00:10:59.155
Let's open up the "head" section at the top.

00:10:59.155 --> 00:11:06.050
We can also see that our stylesheets that we just added should be listed here somewhere.

00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:11.635
There's our foundation.css, that's seen, good.

00:11:11.635 --> 00:11:14.695
We've got the app.css, we just added,

00:11:14.695 --> 00:11:21.650
the foundation-icons too and then finally our style.css file.

00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:28.570
They are all linked. We can

00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:30.100
also do the same thing that we just doing for

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:33.760
the stylesheets by adding extra JavaScript files,

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:37.675
by using the wp_enqueue_script function.

00:11:37.675 --> 00:11:42.415
All we need to do is just do the same as above by copying the function

00:11:42.415 --> 00:11:48.170
but changing the filename to link to our custom JavaScript files.

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:54.940
Let's save that. The last thing I want to do in this video is to include

00:11:54.940 --> 00:12:02.450
the headphones image so the headphones image we added in the header.php file.

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:05.505
This is the image here.

00:12:05.505 --> 00:12:09.195
We need to add our image in the WordPress weigh.

00:12:09.195 --> 00:12:13.540
Inside the quotations for the image source,

00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:20.950
we need to add a PHP function so open up the PHP tags,

00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:24.110
the opening and closing tags.

00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:31.540
Then inside there, we need to add "bloginfo".

00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:37.135
Then open up the brackets and then the quotations.

00:12:37.135 --> 00:12:42.355
To add the file path, we need to do this in a similar way to the stylesheets.

00:12:42.355 --> 00:12:45.530
Let's use the "template_directory".

00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:51.140
I'll just make this a little bit wider.

00:12:51.450 --> 00:12:55.400
Add a semicolon after the brackets.

00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:59.755
Then we need to join on the rest of the file path.

00:12:59.755 --> 00:13:02.080
After the template directory,

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:07.975
we've got the images folder so let's just add this onto the end,

00:13:07.975 --> 00:13:12.710
and then add a forward slash before the image's folder.

00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:22.090
I hope that makes sense.We're using a PHP function called bloginfo,

00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:27.085
which is plugin to the template directory and then we're adding onto the end

00:13:27.085 --> 00:13:30.340
the image's folder and the rest of the file path to

00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:34.520
take us to the headphones image, which you just done.

00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:42.200
Let's save that, then go over to the website and refresh.

00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:46.730
There's a little problem there, let's see what that is.

00:13:47.250 --> 00:13:51.170
The function template directory,

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:55.975
actually this needs to be on the same line,

00:13:55.975 --> 00:13:58.730
it needs to be continuous.

00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:05.680
Let's save that. Let's just try that. There you go.

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:11.365
Now our head section is looking more like our finished version.

00:14:11.365 --> 00:14:19.735
Also the footer area at the bottom is also looking like the finished website.

00:14:19.735 --> 00:14:23.425
That's all our CSS now taking effect.

00:14:23.425 --> 00:14:27.145
There's still quite a lot of work to do but if you come back in the next video,

00:14:27.145 --> 00:14:32.300
we'll continue with the homepage by creating the front-page.php.
