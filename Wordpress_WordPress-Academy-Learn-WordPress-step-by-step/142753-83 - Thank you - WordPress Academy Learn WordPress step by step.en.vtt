00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.030
So you've reached the end of this course.

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.340
Big congratulations from me and you should

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:07.770
be really proud yourself for getting to the end.

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.630
I hope you've learned so much,

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.815
you can now take away and use in future projects of your own.

00:00:13.815 --> 00:00:17.115
So we've covered so much ground from where we first started.

00:00:17.115 --> 00:00:19.695
We began with the web development blog,

00:00:19.695 --> 00:00:22.095
where we call the WordPress basics,

00:00:22.095 --> 00:00:24.555
such as finding and installing themes.

00:00:24.555 --> 00:00:30.855
We also looked at things such as adding posts and how to obtain existing posts.

00:00:30.855 --> 00:00:33.120
We covered various resources,

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.635
to find and how to include media into our blog.

00:00:37.635 --> 00:00:41.105
We also worked with adding pages to our blog,

00:00:41.105 --> 00:00:43.310
such as the About Us page,

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:48.230
the Contact page and dealing with users and comments.

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.620
You learned how to add navigation menus and then we move on to

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.980
the next section and we customized the website even further by adding logos,

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.234
background images and head images.

00:01:01.234 --> 00:01:05.855
We work with the customizer and also work with page widgets

00:01:05.855 --> 00:01:11.870
to self the front page and also move the blog to its own custom page.

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:17.905
We learned how to add sliders and also how to add contact forms.

00:01:17.905 --> 00:01:20.250
Then towards end of the section,

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.910
we looked at various extras,

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:28.145
such as how to improve search engine optimization and how to make backups of our website,

00:01:28.145 --> 00:01:30.840
in case a worst was to happen.

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.345
We then moved on to creating a second project,

00:01:35.345 --> 00:01:40.670
which involves setting up a WordPress database and installing WordPress.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.670
We also got started with Woo Commerce,

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:49.355
both for the e-commerce functionality and also for the storefronts theme.

00:01:49.355 --> 00:01:55.145
We also took a look at using child's themes on various e-commerce related functionality,

00:01:55.145 --> 00:01:58.955
such as product categories, tags and attributes.

00:01:58.955 --> 00:02:03.550
We even looked at creating flexible layouts using Page Builder,

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.560
will include the basic PHP knowledge,

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.470
which you'll need to convert a HTML and

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:15.450
CSS website over to a fully-functioning and great looking WordPress theme.

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:21.110
This section dived even deeper into behind the scenes of WordPress and how

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:28.680
WordPress pages are laid out and how it uses templates to organize and display web pages.

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.210
So bye for now and hopefully,

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:35.490
I'll see you again soon on a future course.
