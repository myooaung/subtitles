00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:11.920
Welcome back. Now we have our new theme installed for our project.

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.220
We're now going to see what it looks like with some content.

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:18.430
At the moment, we just have some sample data, the blogpost,

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.070
the comment, and also the sample page too.

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.840
One way of adding content is to write lots of different blogposts,

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.505
to add lots of different pages,

00:00:27.505 --> 00:00:29.890
and generally create lots of content.

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:31.510
As we progress through this project,

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:34.240
we will be adding a lot of our own content.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.255
But for now we are going to put in at some sample data,

00:00:37.255 --> 00:00:39.985
to check out this theme with more content.

00:00:39.985 --> 00:00:42.190
The way to do this is to head over to

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:47.100
the WordPress website and download the Theme Unit Test data.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.850
This is the same test data which is used by

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.100
the WordPress team to review any newly uploaded themes.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.470
The whole point of this is to make sure you have all angles covered.

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.615
For example, if we create

00:00:59.615 --> 00:01:03.895
a new theme of our own and we want to upload it to WordPress.org,

00:01:03.895 --> 00:01:07.460
if we've not fully tested it ourselves with lots of data,

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.410
we may find that the layout looks a little bit

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:11.780
strange when we have a certain type of image,

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.930
a certain number of blogposts.

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.490
By populating this with all this data,

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.820
we can be sure our theme looks good for all situations.

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.550
But in our case, we're just going to be downloading this to give us

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.385
a head start with our new project.

00:01:25.385 --> 00:01:28.190
The way to install this is to go down to

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.970
the Setup section and we can download a copy from this link.

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:40.575
I'm going to right-click this and then Save Link as and then save this to the desktop.

00:01:40.575 --> 00:01:43.040
To import this, we go back over to

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.775
the WordPress dashboard and then go down to the tool section,

00:01:46.775 --> 00:01:49.465
and inside here we have this importer.

00:01:49.465 --> 00:01:53.970
There is already various importers or setup to

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.080
just if we want to import data from a blogger or a RSS feed.

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.040
But the one we need is this WordPress importer down at

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.110
the bottom pulling our data from an export file.

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.745
Click on Install now, set this up.

00:02:08.745 --> 00:02:11.910
Then run our importer,

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.040
select our file and mine is saved onto the desktop,

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.395
and this is the XML file just here.

00:02:17.395 --> 00:02:22.510
Open this up, click on Upload.

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.545
Just before all of this information is downloaded,

00:02:26.545 --> 00:02:29.470
we can also assign various authors to

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.900
these new blogposts and these pages which are being created.

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.145
We could have create a new username,

00:02:35.145 --> 00:02:37.960
or we can select any one which you already have set up,

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.270
and in our case, we only have this blog admin.

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.550
We can assign this if we want to.

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.325
However, though, I'm just going to leave this empty,

00:02:45.325 --> 00:02:48.715
or I'm going to check the import attachments section.

00:02:48.715 --> 00:02:51.160
This will download things which such as the images,

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.500
which we're going to need for our project.

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:59.200
Click on Submit and give this some few moments to download.

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.220
Great. Once it has finished,

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.165
we can on go to the front end of our site, hit Refresh.

00:03:08.165 --> 00:03:11.740
All of this sample data has now been imported.

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:14.490
We can see all of our pages at the very top,

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:16.610
we also have some drop-down menus.

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:18.530
We have all of our blogposts.

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.590
If we scroll down, we can see some of the media which has been downloaded,

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.419
we have various images.

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:24.860
These have various dates,

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:26.740
they have various offers,

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:31.115
also some of these will have comments and also various tags and categories.

00:03:31.115 --> 00:03:33.335
You see the comments over on the right,

00:03:33.335 --> 00:03:35.060
we can click into these.

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.685
This now leaves us with a some of blogpost data to work with in our project.

00:03:39.685 --> 00:03:43.280
If you did have any issues at all downloading this data,

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.630
don't worry, this is just some sample data to work with.

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:50.930
Next we're going to move on to the next video where we're going to see how we can add

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:56.160
our own blogposts and also update any existing ones too.
