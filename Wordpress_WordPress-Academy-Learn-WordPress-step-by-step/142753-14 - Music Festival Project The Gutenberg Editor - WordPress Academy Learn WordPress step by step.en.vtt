00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:04.930
In WordPress version 5,

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:10.940
they released a whole new revamped editor for editing our blog posts and pages.

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:12.930
This was called Gutenberg.

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:14.905
This allows us to move away from

00:00:14.905 --> 00:00:20.590
a sort editor approach and replace our content using blocks.

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:23.739
We're now going to take a look at the Gutenberg website

00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:27.410
and take a quick overview of how these blocks work.

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:30.040
I'm currently on wordpress.org,

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.095
which has this Gutenberg section.

00:00:32.095 --> 00:00:34.960
This is going to give us an overview of some of the blocks

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.510
which are available to create our blog posts and our pages.

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.580
Now we don't need to head over to this page,

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:44.705
but this is going to give you an idea of exactly what is available.

00:00:44.705 --> 00:00:48.610
We have some basic text blocks, we have images,

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:53.780
we have buttons, and also ones to help out with layout such as columns.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.275
We can edit them, we can rearrange them,

00:00:56.275 --> 00:00:59.930
and in some cases we can also nest them inside of each other too.

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:01.920
If we go back over to the Dashboard,

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.530
we can make use of these inside of our pages.

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.360
Currently our homepage is empty,

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.965
so we're going to go over to this,

00:01:08.965 --> 00:01:10.810
and we'll go into the edit section,

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.350
where we can make use of some of these blocks.

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.030
To add a block we can simply start to type inside here.

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:23.025
This will give us a simple text block or we can click on the plus icon in the top left.

00:01:23.025 --> 00:01:28.520
We can scroll through all the different types of blocks and sections which are available.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.070
We've got pretty much any type of content

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.515
which is going to be required for building the page.

00:01:33.515 --> 00:01:35.480
We have tables, we have images,

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.130
we have galleries, we have video sections,

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.650
we have this design section where we can lit up

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.395
our page into different sections and columns.

00:01:43.395 --> 00:01:45.090
We can break up our pages.

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.980
We edit separators, we have all of these pre-built widgets which will allow

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:53.315
us to add calendars and links to our latest blog post.

00:01:53.315 --> 00:01:55.295
We've social media links,

00:01:55.295 --> 00:01:58.730
and also different plugins can add different blocks in here too,

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:01.070
such as WooCommerce, which will allow us to add

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.555
some e-commerce functionality into our pages.

00:02:04.555 --> 00:02:07.760
To begin, I'm going to add a heading into our page,

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.450
which is going to be a level 2 heading.

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.725
We click on this, make sure the H2 is selected.

00:02:13.725 --> 00:02:17.535
Then we can simply add the text which we want as our page heading.

00:02:17.535 --> 00:02:19.510
Since this is a festival,

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:25.550
I'm going to say a full weekend of live music and entertainment.

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:32.740
All we need to do is click off this and now our heading is in place.

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.130
Since this is a festival and it's based over the weekend,

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.060
the next block I'm going to create is going to be a two column layout.

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.865
The left column is going to be for the Saturday,

00:02:42.865 --> 00:02:47.500
and the right column is going to be for the events which is happening on the Sunday.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.950
Go back to our plus icon, and inside here,

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.920
if we scroll down to the design section,

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:58.565
we can click on "Columns" We're going to go for a 50/50 two column layout.

00:02:58.565 --> 00:03:01.925
First of all, the left column is going to be for the Saturday.

00:03:01.925 --> 00:03:06.070
I'm going to nest a new block inside which is going to be a heading.

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:10.655
This time we'll make this our level 3 heading so it's a little bit smaller,

00:03:10.655 --> 00:03:12.815
and this is for our Saturday.

00:03:12.815 --> 00:03:15.230
We can also format this section too.

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.655
I'm going to align the text into the center.

00:03:18.655 --> 00:03:23.190
I'm going to also go to the color settings and adjust this too.

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.135
I'm going to go for the green color for this section.

00:03:26.135 --> 00:03:28.355
Then with this selected,

00:03:28.355 --> 00:03:30.860
we can click on the plus icon or just below.

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.555
This will add a new block directly below our level 3 heading.

00:03:34.555 --> 00:03:38.015
This is going to be a list which is going to list out all

00:03:38.015 --> 00:03:41.915
of the events or all of the information about this Saturday.

00:03:41.915 --> 00:03:44.970
We're going to say eight live bands.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.020
Then if we hit "Enter" we can keep going with our list.

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:54.715
We'll say 20 singers, two DJ's,

00:03:54.715 --> 00:03:57.040
eight food and drink stalls,

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:00.720
four stages and three arenas.

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.660
Then finally, free overnight camping with tickets.

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.725
Once we're done, we can just come out of this,

00:04:10.725 --> 00:04:13.265
and let's remove the last bullet point.

00:04:13.265 --> 00:04:16.705
Then this is the Saturday section all complete.

00:04:16.705 --> 00:04:19.595
Now over on the right, we can create the Sunday section,

00:04:19.595 --> 00:04:22.070
beginning again with a level 3 heading,

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:26.190
which is going to have the text of Sunday over this,

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.725
and we're going to then align this into the center.

00:04:28.725 --> 00:04:31.800
Then match the color from the left.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.950
Then if we click on the plus icon,

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:36.200
we can then add our list just below.

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:41.810
This Sunday is going to have 10 live bands, 18 singers,

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:49.350
three DJs, eight food and drinks stalls,

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:55.980
same four stages, and three arenas.

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:59.530
Finally the closing party.

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:04.505
At any point we can click on "Update" and we can checkout how this is looking.

00:05:04.505 --> 00:05:06.745
We go and visit our front page.

00:05:06.745 --> 00:05:11.620
Go down. We see our heading and also the two lists on the left and right.

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.980
You maybe also want to center this level 2 heading,

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:16.975
so let's go up to this.

00:05:16.975 --> 00:05:23.350
If we hover over, we can align this text into the center. Update this.

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:28.630
Next we're going to introduce a media and text block.

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:31.480
If we click on the plus icon,

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:35.615
we can actually do a search for this or say Media and Text.

00:05:35.615 --> 00:05:39.220
Then on the left-hand side we can add an image or a video.

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:41.260
If we go over to the Media Library,

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.525
we can select any of these pre-uploaded images.

00:05:44.525 --> 00:05:47.330
I want to select the image of the guitar,

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:50.820
and then say early bird tickets now available.

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:54.770
Between each one of these blocks,

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:56.510
I'm also going to add a separator.

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:58.550
If we click on the plus icon,

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:01.525
we can use the search for a separator.

00:06:01.525 --> 00:06:04.380
Then we can click on the up icon to rearrange

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:08.265
this and place this above our media and text.

00:06:08.265 --> 00:06:12.285
We'll do the same just below, we'll also add a separator.

00:06:12.285 --> 00:06:15.685
This time we'll keep this below our section.

00:06:15.685 --> 00:06:19.145
Even though this is a media and a text section

00:06:19.145 --> 00:06:22.355
we're not just restricted to adding text into this section.

00:06:22.355 --> 00:06:26.015
If we hit "Enter" we can then click on the plus icon,

00:06:26.015 --> 00:06:28.570
and we can also add a button inside here.

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:33.560
This button is going to allow us to link to the tickets which we're currently offering,

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.210
so we'll say by now.

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:37.400
To give this some styling, I'm also going to use

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.495
the same green color that we used before.

00:06:40.495 --> 00:06:45.495
Let's update this and see how this is looking on the front-end.

00:06:45.495 --> 00:06:50.855
The next thing we're going to move down to is an image gallery from last year's event.

00:06:50.855 --> 00:06:54.485
At the next section we're going to add a level 2 heading,

00:06:54.485 --> 00:06:58.290
which is going to have the text of last year's event.

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:05.220
We can also place this into the center.

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:10.010
Then just below this click on the plus icon and we can add an image gallery.

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:13.280
Again, we can upload fresh images or we can use

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:16.690
the Media Library to reuse the existing images.

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:19.095
Let's select any four of these,

00:07:19.095 --> 00:07:21.860
and we can select multiple images at the same time.

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:25.100
Click on "Create a new gallery" and insert.

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:28.580
Clicking on any of these images will allow us to click on the left and

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:32.350
right buttons so we can rearrange the order of these images.

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:37.290
After this, we'll add our separator, keep it consistent.

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:42.740
The last section is going to be for the tickets information.

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:46.290
Let's give this a heading of ticket info.

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:50.625
We'll also align this into the center.

00:07:50.625 --> 00:07:52.940
The final block which we're going to use at

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:56.690
the very bottom is going to be for a three column layout.

00:07:56.690 --> 00:07:58.690
I'll select the columns.

00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:02.100
Inside here we can go for three equal columns.

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:06.395
This is going to be laid out pretty much like a table for all of our ticket prices.

00:08:06.395 --> 00:08:08.210
We're going to have a pre-sale section,

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:09.650
an early bird section,

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:11.930
and then the standard ticket rates.

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:16.280
We could also add this table with a table block which is available.

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:19.160
But I'm going to create my own using three columns,

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:21.730
though we don't have the borders around each section.

00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:25.805
In the same way as we did with the two column section just above,

00:08:25.805 --> 00:08:27.380
inside of each one of our columns,

00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:29.070
we can add new blocks.

00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:31.150
These are just going to be text sections.

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:34.585
Click on the "Paragraph" for each one of these pieces of text.

00:08:34.585 --> 00:08:36.714
The first one is pre-sale.

00:08:36.714 --> 00:08:38.340
Since this is a header,

00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:40.080
we'll make this bold.

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:41.800
Make sure it's all selected,

00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:46.230
and then click on "Bold" Also we'll put this into the center.

00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:50.650
It can be a little bit tricky to click on the plus icon on the correct point.

00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:52.060
If we just come off this,

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:57.140
the next plus icon we'll create this section below this whole three-column layout.

00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:59.220
Instead with our text selected,

00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:03.895
if we hit "Enter" we then have the option to add a new line of text.

00:09:03.895 --> 00:09:07.930
We'll say all gone. Enter this.

00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:10.000
Since this is a sold out section,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.410
we'll change the text color to be red.

00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:15.150
Click inside of our text section and then hit

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:18.935
"Enter" The next one is going to be for the price.

00:09:18.935 --> 00:09:22.880
Since this is a sold out section we'll highlight our text.

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:26.815
Then we'll add a strikethrough to show this is being sold out.

00:09:26.815 --> 00:09:28.875
Place this into the center.

00:09:28.875 --> 00:09:31.470
Our first column is now done.

00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:36.190
Into the middle section this is going to be for the early bird section.

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:42.645
Place this into the center and also make this bold.

00:09:42.645 --> 00:09:47.070
Hit "Enter" This is going to be on sale now.

00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:49.260
This is the active section,

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.080
so instead of having this as red,

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:54.690
we're going to highlight this as the green color.

00:09:55.040 --> 00:10:00.790
Once again hit "Enter" and we can add a price into this for 35.

00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:04.575
After the early bird section,

00:10:04.575 --> 00:10:08.240
the final one is going to be for the standard rate.

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:10.675
Select all, I'll make this bold,

00:10:10.675 --> 00:10:12.890
place into the center.

00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:18.980
The second line is going to be after 20th of August.

00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:22.220
Place into the center.

00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:26.500
Then finally the price for the standard section of 49.

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:28.060
Place this into the center,

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:30.710
and our section is now done.

00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:38.120
Update this. There's our image gallery and our ticket information down at the bottom.
