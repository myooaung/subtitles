00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:09.630
Now, we've been mostly focusing on our blog and also our blog posts, but in this video,

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.060
we're going to look at how we can add some custom pages,

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:16.275
such as an About Us and also a Contact Us page too.

00:00:16.275 --> 00:00:19.860
Pages which were added with the sample content earlier

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.820
have automatically been added to our menu at the top.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.000
We don't need any of these pages for our project,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.585
so we're going to remove these and then create our own,

00:00:30.585 --> 00:00:36.075
over to the Dashboard view and into the pages select "All."

00:00:36.075 --> 00:00:40.320
From here, we can hover over and delete any of these manually or we can

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.215
click on the top checkbox and then delete these with the bulk actions,

00:00:45.215 --> 00:00:49.150
move to trash, and apply this to all of these.

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.580
We also have a second Page.

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:56.410
I will remove these ones too, Add New.

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.615
This first page will be the About Us,

00:00:59.615 --> 00:01:02.040
so adding the page title.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.305
Then we can go ahead and add some content just below.

00:01:05.305 --> 00:01:08.170
You can create any About Us information which you want to,

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.925
but I'm going to go to Lorem Ipsum and then grab some sample content, place inside here.

00:01:13.925 --> 00:01:19.115
Search for "Lorem Ipsum," head over to lipsum.com.

00:01:19.115 --> 00:01:25.400
We can generate as many paragraphs as we would like. I'm going to stick with five.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.020
Copy all of this back over to

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.755
a new page and then we can paste this into the block just below.

00:01:32.755 --> 00:01:34.480
Also, just like earlier,

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.630
we can hover over any of the sections and we can edit them,

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:38.650
we can change the colors,

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:40.735
we can change all of the font settings.

00:01:40.735 --> 00:01:43.855
However, I'm just going to leave this as plain text for now.

00:01:43.855 --> 00:01:47.875
But this is one option of adding content per page,

00:01:47.875 --> 00:01:50.650
as well as adding all of these content blocks,

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.530
if we go to the page section hover on the right,

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.545
amongst all of the other options we have the Page

00:01:56.545 --> 00:01:59.825
Attributes where we can select a template.

00:01:59.825 --> 00:02:04.885
A template is something which is provided by the Themes Creator and it allows us to

00:02:04.885 --> 00:02:10.040
create different layouts and at different types of content to our WordPress pages.

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:13.685
These templates are special files which are inserted in our theme,

00:02:13.685 --> 00:02:16.805
and we can use on either a single page just like this,

00:02:16.805 --> 00:02:19.610
so it only applies to one or single page,

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.970
or we can have a more generic template which you want to apply to multiple pages.

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.705
For example, we could have one template which is for a 404 page,

00:02:29.705 --> 00:02:32.780
then we could have a different multi-use templates,

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.595
which is applied to all of the pages to give us a consistent look and feel.

00:02:37.595 --> 00:02:40.430
We will look at templates in more detail when we get to

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.860
creating our own theme from scratch,

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.095
which we'll do later on in the course.

00:02:45.095 --> 00:02:49.550
But for now let's just stick with this page content which you've added inside the blocks,

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:53.400
publish our page, confirm.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.475
Now if we refresh,

00:02:55.475 --> 00:02:59.600
all of these sample pages have been removed and the About Us page has

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.125
been automatically added to this menu. Click on this.

00:03:04.125 --> 00:03:07.640
There's all of the texts which we've added to our page.

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.735
Of course, we are free to use as many blocks as we want.

00:03:10.735 --> 00:03:12.490
We can add media and all of

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:15.955
the different types of blocks which we've seen in previous videos,

00:03:15.955 --> 00:03:20.260
as well as this content and also the templates, we click on this.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.560
We also have different layout options down at the bottom.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.810
We're currently using this default layout,

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.620
which you can see is the text on the left and the sidebar over on the right.

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.160
We can also change this, for example,

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.550
if one of these sidebars replaced on the left,

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:39.795
we can update this, refresh.

00:03:39.795 --> 00:03:45.710
We can also remove the sidebar and have the content be the full width of the page.

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.710
This is really useful for changing the look and feel of our pages.

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:53.330
I want to leave this as the default,

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.340
which is the sidebar on the right.

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.530
Remember, all of these options are available

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.790
because of the specific theme which we have chosen.

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:02.780
You may be thinking, "Well,

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:07.685
how do we know exactly which options are available before downloading a theme?"

00:04:07.685 --> 00:04:10.820
Well, this is available when downloading a theme from

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:15.175
wordpress.org and also some of the overall theme providers too.

00:04:15.175 --> 00:04:18.080
If we go into the theme section,

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:21.870
let's take a look for our spacious theme.

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:26.630
This is one here, so we can click on "More Info" and

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:30.245
then we see this has 13 different widget areas;

00:04:30.245 --> 00:04:32.630
it has four different page layouts,

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:35.834
different page templates, it's responsive,

00:04:35.834 --> 00:04:39.240
and all over with different layout and color options too.

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.540
Now, although we've looked at these theme options in

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:44.215
the past and also the tags which were available,

00:04:44.215 --> 00:04:47.210
hopefully now you seen inaction inside of a site.

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:50.585
You should be now a lot more comfortable with Slack and a particular theme,

00:04:50.585 --> 00:04:54.345
based on these options. I go over to our slide.

00:04:54.345 --> 00:04:56.900
Now, I'm going to add the rest of the pages which we need,

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.000
which is going to be the Contact Us page and also the Blog page.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.655
Make sure this is updated,

00:05:02.655 --> 00:05:08.700
and then we can click on the "WordPress Icon," we're taken back to all pages, "Add New."

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:12.190
This one will be for the Contact Us.

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:18.695
Just below this, I'm going to add a content block which is a list.

00:05:18.695 --> 00:05:27.455
Let's search for this and just a few lines of sample address data, Address Line 1.

00:05:27.455 --> 00:05:32.705
Copy this, hit "Enter" and we can add as many lines as want to inside here.

00:05:32.705 --> 00:05:35.995
It doesn't really matter for this demonstration.

00:05:35.995 --> 00:05:38.000
As with all of your blocks,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.875
we can select any of these lines.

00:05:39.875 --> 00:05:42.939
We can change this to be a ordered list with the numbers,

00:05:42.939 --> 00:05:46.790
but I'm going to keep this as the bulleted list, which is unordered.

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:48.800
Just like with most of text blocks,

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:49.940
we can format the text,

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:51.235
we can change the color,

00:05:51.235 --> 00:05:53.790
and also change the links if we would like.

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:57.215
Now, we could go ahead and publish this page if we wanted to,

00:05:57.215 --> 00:06:02.965
and this page will automatically be added to our menu alongside the About Us link.

00:06:02.965 --> 00:06:05.650
However, though I'm going to do this a little differently,

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:08.440
what I would like for the Contact Us page is for this to only

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:11.590
appear when we hover over the About Us link.

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:14.110
So when we place the mouse over this,

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:17.930
is will get a drop-down menu where we can select our contact page.

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:21.549
Do this, instead of publishing this directly,

00:06:21.549 --> 00:06:26.495
we're going to go into the page settings and then down into the "Parent Page".

00:06:26.495 --> 00:06:28.350
We only have this About Us page,

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:29.595
so we can select this.

00:06:29.595 --> 00:06:31.000
If we have multiple pages,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.890
we could also rearrange the order.

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:34.885
But for now hit "Publish",

00:06:34.885 --> 00:06:39.245
"Confirm", refresh our blog.

00:06:39.245 --> 00:06:44.415
Then hover over the About Us link will reveal our new contact page.

00:06:44.415 --> 00:06:48.935
We can also select this and we'll be taken to our Contact Us page,

00:06:48.935 --> 00:06:52.000
which is nested inside of the About Us link.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.995
Now this is just some data which is going to display,

00:06:54.995 --> 00:06:59.540
but later on we're going to come back to this page and add a contact form.

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:03.395
Just to round off this video back over to the Dashboard

00:07:03.395 --> 00:07:08.795
into the pages where we're going to add our third and final page for the blog.

00:07:08.795 --> 00:07:11.405
The blog page is going to be the home for

00:07:11.405 --> 00:07:14.735
our blog posts rather than the default homepage,

00:07:14.735 --> 00:07:18.205
which we currently have, if we click on our "Site Icon."

00:07:18.205 --> 00:07:21.739
At the moment, all of these blog posts are listed on this homepage,

00:07:21.739 --> 00:07:27.010
but later on we'll have a dedicated blog page where these would be placed inside.

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:30.435
All we need to do is to publish this,

00:07:30.435 --> 00:07:36.575
refresh and now this empty page is now being also placed inside of the Nav bar.

00:07:36.575 --> 00:07:39.380
This is all the pages which we need for now.

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:40.970
Next, we're going to take a look at

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:45.930
Navigation Menus and how to add a custom menu to our site.
