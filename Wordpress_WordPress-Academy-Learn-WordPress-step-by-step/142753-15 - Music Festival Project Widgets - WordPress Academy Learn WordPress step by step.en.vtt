00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:05.445
The theme which I have chosen,

00:00:05.445 --> 00:00:09.165
along with many others, supports add-in widgets.

00:00:09.165 --> 00:00:12.240
A widget is a small feature or

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.515
a small piece of content which we can place into our theme.

00:00:16.515 --> 00:00:21.570
Now, we can't just go ahead and place these widgets into any area which we would like.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.750
These widget areas where we can drop these into has been preset by the themes offer.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.970
Let's take a look at how we can work with widgets with our current theme.

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:38.255
If we go back over to our homepage and into the edit section,

00:00:38.255 --> 00:00:43.100
right down at the very bottom below all of our blocks with the under the layout section,

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.915
we have these footer widgets.

00:00:44.915 --> 00:00:47.300
The author of this theme has allowed us to assess

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.725
how many areas we want to customize inside the footer.

00:00:50.725 --> 00:00:53.300
The default value is free,

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.250
meaning the footer is split into three sections where we can add our content blocks.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.410
Also, remember from just above this,

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:01.955
we have this sidebar section,

00:01:01.955 --> 00:01:05.165
where we can lay out our content alongside a sidebar.

00:01:05.165 --> 00:01:11.230
Well, both the sidebars section and also the footer section and both exact widget.

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:13.070
To access our widgets,

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.890
we go back to the main dashboard and then into

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.765
the appearance section where we have a dedicated widgets menu.

00:01:19.765 --> 00:01:23.150
This page has been split into two sections,

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:24.320
where on the left we have

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.400
the available widgets which we can add to our project such as calendars,

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.540
menus, search boxes, and also things related to our blog,

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.975
so just comments and recent posts.

00:01:34.975 --> 00:01:36.620
Then on the right, we have all of

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.625
the available theme areas where we can add these widgets too,

00:01:40.625 --> 00:01:42.710
all these sections can be customized,

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.625
and I'm now going to add some widgets into the footer.

00:01:45.625 --> 00:01:49.715
Footer Widget 1 is the first position inside of our footer.

00:01:49.715 --> 00:01:51.980
This is going to be placed on the left-hand side.

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:53.750
This first widget is going to be

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.610
a simple text blocks so you can drag over the text widgets,

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.169
the title of Go VIP,

00:02:00.169 --> 00:02:03.874
and then some text in the block below of upgrade to VIP,

00:02:03.874 --> 00:02:06.810
and enjoy your weekend even more.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.520
The text editor is pretty simple,

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.760
I'm going to add a bulleted list just below.

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.995
On the first line is going to be exclusive VIP only bars,

00:02:17.995 --> 00:02:23.430
the next is going to be for exclusive toilet facilities,

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:32.510
and the final one is going to be the camping area close to main main stages.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.795
Now, we're going to go over to the footer area 2.

00:02:38.795 --> 00:02:41.170
This will be the middle section of our free.

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.935
Inside here, we're going to create a link to our latest blog posts.

00:02:44.935 --> 00:02:48.920
To do this, we have a recent post widget which we can drag over.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.725
If we wanted to, we could also add a multiple widgets into any one of these sections.

00:02:53.725 --> 00:02:56.305
We're not restricted to just one.

00:02:56.305 --> 00:02:59.335
The title of keep up to date with our blog,

00:02:59.335 --> 00:03:03.500
and then we can set how many of the recent posts we want to show.

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.140
Our site, currently, has

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.220
the single blog post which was created when we installed WordPress.

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.090
Well, over though we can restrict this to be five and we can also display

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:18.010
the post date one too like this and save our widget.

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.060
The third one is going to be a audio clip from last year's events.

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.705
To do this, I have a audio clip just saved on my desktop.

00:03:25.705 --> 00:03:29.035
Now I've not included this audio file with the cost,

00:03:29.035 --> 00:03:32.020
since this was a licensed piece of audio.

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.450
But you can use an audio clip of your own or search

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.970
online and then include this if you want to.

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.800
This is going to go into Footer Widget 3.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.360
Drag over the audio section,

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.630
add a title of, hear a sample from last year's events.'

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.910
We can then access the media library where we can drag over

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.630
our audio clip at this and then save our widget.

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:01.150
Let us go now and check out our footer area on the front end.

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.000
Go down to the bottom and here is our free sections which we just recreated.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.960
We have our text widgets,

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.290
have the blog section,

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.285
and we can click on any of these links.

00:04:10.285 --> 00:04:13.210
We only have this one sample hello world blog post.

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:16.250
But remember this will show a maximum of five.

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.420
Then in the third section of our footer,

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:19.840
we have this audio clip,

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.450
which is a fully working audio player.

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.130
We can play, we can pause,

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.860
we can skip through different parts of our track,

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.665
and we can also control the audio volume too.

00:04:29.665 --> 00:04:32.580
This is now our first project now completed.

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.085
We have a nice project in a very short time.

00:04:36.085 --> 00:04:39.950
This webpage is also responsive too by default.

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:41.810
If we shrink this down to a smaller size,

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:46.055
it will adjust the layout and also the scaling to suit this device.

00:04:46.055 --> 00:04:49.624
The next project we're going to go a little deeper into WordPress,

00:04:49.624 --> 00:04:52.505
where we're going to build our own personal blog

00:04:52.505 --> 00:04:55.805
and we'll also learn about new things such as now menus,

00:04:55.805 --> 00:04:59.460
users, comments, and so much more.
