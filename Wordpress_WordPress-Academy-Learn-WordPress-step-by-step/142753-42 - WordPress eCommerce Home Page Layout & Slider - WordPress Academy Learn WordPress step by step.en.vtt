00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:08.385
Welcome back. If we go to our Homepage by clicking on our site title over the top,

00:00:08.385 --> 00:00:10.560
all this home link inside the menu.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.095
We're taken to the Homepage, which by default,

00:00:13.095 --> 00:00:14.520
with any WordPress theme,

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.560
is just a blog page.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.175
The start from the theme by default is no different to this,

00:00:20.175 --> 00:00:23.880
so what we're going to do in this Homepage is to transform it,

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.025
to look more like e-commerce store.

00:00:26.025 --> 00:00:27.840
We're going to add lots of new sections.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.180
We're going to display our top rated products,

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.450
our featured items, our items which are on sale,

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.850
different categories, and so much more.

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.260
To do this, we first need a home to actually place these into.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.195
Back over to the dashboard,

00:00:42.195 --> 00:00:47.140
and into the pages, Add New.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.935
This one is going to be for our Homepage.

00:00:50.935 --> 00:00:53.735
If we wanted to, we could construct this with

00:00:53.735 --> 00:00:56.270
all of the blogs which we've seen in previous videos.

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.095
We could create all of these sections and if we go up to the top corner,

00:01:00.095 --> 00:01:03.640
into the block section, go down.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.170
We actually have a WooCommerce section with all of the different blocks,

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.220
which can place into this page.

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.535
We have full control over the customization of this.

00:01:13.535 --> 00:01:15.125
We can add categories,

00:01:15.125 --> 00:01:17.630
featured products, we can place in reviews,

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.999
we can filter these down by categories,

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:23.825
tags and attributes, and also at a price filter too.

00:01:23.825 --> 00:01:27.560
This is really flexible and we can go this way if we want to,

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:33.205
or another alternative is to use a pre-built template which comes with this theme.

00:01:33.205 --> 00:01:37.590
Into the page tab in the sidebar, downside the attributes.

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.010
We're currently using this default template.

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.220
But WooCommerce also provides a Homepage template,

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.355
which we can use as a quick start.

00:01:45.355 --> 00:01:47.430
Which is all we need to do,

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:54.135
and publish this page and go over to our site, refresh.

00:01:54.135 --> 00:01:56.220
We don't see anything different just yet,

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.480
the only difference is we now have two Homepage links.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.340
We'll fix this very soon.

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.200
As we know from previous projects,

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.690
to remove the blog posts from the Homepage,

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:07.955
we need to go over to the dashboard,

00:02:07.955 --> 00:02:10.670
and change this from the settings.

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.695
From here, head into the reading option,

00:02:14.695 --> 00:02:18.335
and then we can change this Homepage to display a static page,

00:02:18.335 --> 00:02:20.345
which is going to be the home.

00:02:20.345 --> 00:02:22.865
The posts, we can also change this to

00:02:22.865 --> 00:02:25.595
a block section if we want to create a new page too.

00:02:25.595 --> 00:02:29.655
But I'm just going to leave this empty for now. Save this.

00:02:29.655 --> 00:02:32.630
Now if we go back to our store and refresh,

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.560
the Homepage has now been transformed, we have the title,

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.800
we have the category section,

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.720
we have the new product which we recently created,

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.945
recommended, favorites, and also the Best Sellers at the bottom too.

00:02:46.945 --> 00:02:50.590
This is how it looks out of the box with WooCommerce.

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.580
But we sometimes want to make changes to this,

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.380
and make it more personal.

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.740
For example, since we only have this T-Shirts category,

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:01.055
we don't really want this category section to be displaying,

00:03:01.055 --> 00:03:04.700
and also would be good if we could remove this home texts too.

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.390
To do this, we can add in a plugin by WooThemes,

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.430
which is called Homepage control.

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.950
This will mean we can edit the section,

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:14.060
we can rearrange things,

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.840
and we can also remove any sections too.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.510
Go to the dashboard,

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.985
this is installed as a plugin.

00:03:20.985 --> 00:03:23.440
Let's add a new one,

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.060
and do search for Homepage control.

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.465
This is the plugin which we need by WooThemes,

00:03:33.465 --> 00:03:42.510
install this, activate until accesses plugin.

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.740
We need to go into the plugins and then into the customizer.

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:50.720
Customizer now has the Homepage control option where we

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.010
can check and uncheck any of these sections which want to add or remove.

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.635
But first of all, the Homepage content,

00:03:57.635 --> 00:03:59.045
if we uncheck this,

00:03:59.045 --> 00:04:01.735
which is just going to remove the home title.

00:04:01.735 --> 00:04:04.145
This is the one just here.

00:04:04.145 --> 00:04:06.620
We don't need this, the categories.

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.735
It also remove this until we get some more categories to display.

00:04:10.735 --> 00:04:13.210
The rest of these are pretty fine as they are.

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:14.890
We can also drag these,

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:16.840
and rearrange these into a different order.

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.820
We can customize this to display the sections in any order which you want to.

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.240
You can also check out how it looks on a smaller screen.

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.100
If you click on the mobile view,

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.165
this reduces down all of the products to be the full width of the screen.

00:04:31.165 --> 00:04:36.150
Let's publish this, and over to Homepage on refresh.

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.985
This is all now being updated.

00:04:38.985 --> 00:04:44.140
Another popular feature we see on e-commerce stores is a image slider,

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:47.350
and this is often placed just below the header section.

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:50.195
Like the previous project which we created,

00:04:50.195 --> 00:04:54.810
this particular theme doesn't include its own built-in slider, but this is fine.

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:58.725
WordPress has a hundreds of slides we can use as plugins.

00:04:58.725 --> 00:05:04.595
Back over to the dashboard into the plugin section and Add New.

00:05:04.595 --> 00:05:06.890
You can choose any plugin which you want to,

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:10.920
but I'm going to do a search for MetaSlider.

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:16.810
This is one we need just there, install.

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:36.535
Activate this plugin and we now have a option inside the slide bar.

00:05:36.535 --> 00:05:39.490
Down at the bottom. Click on this.

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:44.200
We have a Quick start section and we can drop our images directly into here.

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:48.385
But I'm going to create a blank slideshow with this button just here.

00:05:48.385 --> 00:05:53.065
This will then need to add multiple slides which are going to display our images.

00:05:53.065 --> 00:05:56.470
Provided with the images download is two different slides,

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:58.135
which I'm going to now add.

00:05:58.135 --> 00:06:01.585
But first of all, the three for two on plain T-shirts.

00:06:01.585 --> 00:06:03.610
We can add this to our slideshow.

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:07.450
We could enter a caption if you want to add some text to be overlaid,

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:11.395
but since this already has the tags of three for two on plain T-shirts.

00:06:11.395 --> 00:06:14.105
I'm going to leave this image without the caption.

00:06:14.105 --> 00:06:17.030
We can also place in a dedicated URL.

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:19.390
If you have a page that link this too.

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:23.270
There's also search engine options where we can add things like the old text.

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:24.725
We can crop the image,

00:06:24.725 --> 00:06:27.110
we can rearrange this into different locations.

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:30.140
It's also further options if we add the Pro pack.

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:32.120
Well, this is a paid upgrade.

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:36.275
Over on the right, we can change the height and the width of the slideshow.

00:06:36.275 --> 00:06:38.360
We can add transition effects.

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:41.345
We can show the arrows, which is the arrow on the left and right,

00:06:41.345 --> 00:06:43.630
the switch between these images.

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:45.560
That's our second slide,

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:48.860
which is going to be the free printing on your first-order.

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:51.755
Again, we have all of the same options,

00:06:51.755 --> 00:06:55.780
but I'm just going to leave this as the default and then save this.

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:59.540
You place this into WooTheme will have multiple options.

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:01.820
One of the most simple ways of doing this,

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:07.010
is to add this as a widget into the appearance, widgets section.

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:10.655
Over on the left, we now see a MetaSlider widget,

00:07:10.655 --> 00:07:13.535
which we can now replace into all locations.

00:07:13.535 --> 00:07:15.995
Move on to this, just below the header,

00:07:15.995 --> 00:07:20.350
we can add this in, all to our sites and refresh.

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:22.610
As our slider with our arrows,

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:24.710
and we also have these buttons down at the bottom,

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:27.710
to switch between these images, the slider,

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:32.930
since it's place below the header will be visible on all of the additional pages too.

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:37.400
But if we want to filter this down to only appeal on certain pages,

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:38.885
such as our home,

00:07:38.885 --> 00:07:42.560
where we can do this, is by removing widgets.

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:45.990
Then if we go back into our slideshow,

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:49.730
down at the bottom, we have a How to Use section.

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:51.470
We have the coding version,

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:54.155
which is to copy this full PHP section,

00:07:54.155 --> 00:07:57.575
and we can copy and paste this into our page templates.

00:07:57.575 --> 00:07:59.810
This one needs to go into our theme,

00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:02.810
and then find the exact template which controls the Homepage.

00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:04.940
Or another way we can do this without

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:08.755
any coding is to copy this orange section in the middle.

00:08:08.755 --> 00:08:12.290
Then we can paste this into any page which we want to.

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:15.570
I want to go over to the Homepage.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.670
Then like we've looked at in the past,

00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:22.415
we paste this into one volt blocks.

00:08:22.415 --> 00:08:25.960
WordPress recognizes this is a short code,

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:31.865
know needs to do is to update this page over to our site and refresh on the Homepage,

00:08:31.865 --> 00:08:34.925
and we don't see the slider appearing at the top.

00:08:34.925 --> 00:08:38.245
In fact, if we scroll down, we don't see it anywhere on this page.

00:08:38.245 --> 00:08:39.980
This may seem pretty confusing,

00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:43.325
but this is because if we go over to the dashboard,

00:08:43.325 --> 00:08:45.680
and then into the customizer,

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:50.105
earlier when we setup our Homepage with his Homepage control plugin,

00:08:50.105 --> 00:08:52.900
we disabled the Homepage content.

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:56.270
It's Homepage content was to remove the page title,

00:08:56.270 --> 00:09:01.355
and this was all of the content or all the blocks which is inside of our page.

00:09:01.355 --> 00:09:05.990
Unfortunately, this is also removing our slideshow block too.

00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:08.105
If we check this,

00:09:08.105 --> 00:09:12.635
we can see our slider, but we can also see our title at the top too.

00:09:12.635 --> 00:09:17.245
So how do we go about having a slider but not this title?

00:09:17.245 --> 00:09:19.950
Well, first of all, let's publishes.

00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:24.320
Then go back down to this additional CSS section.

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:29.165
This have some different options of how we can remove our page title.

00:09:29.165 --> 00:09:32.840
If we wanted to, we could jump into the theme,

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:35.615
and do some customization with the code.

00:09:35.615 --> 00:09:39.305
But instead we're going to be doing this with some CSS.

00:09:39.305 --> 00:09:42.880
CSS is just some code which you can add to the section,

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:47.955
which is going to change the look and feel of our site. But we do this.

00:09:47.955 --> 00:09:50.355
We first need to crop the page title,

00:09:50.355 --> 00:09:52.349
so go to the dashboard,

00:09:52.349 --> 00:09:57.865
into the pages and click on the "Edit" section of our home page.

00:09:57.865 --> 00:10:01.120
We need to take note of this post number at the top,

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:03.875
and this is the Homepage ID.

00:10:03.875 --> 00:10:06.625
What we need to do is a dot,

00:10:06.625 --> 00:10:10.150
page dash ID dash,

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:13.090
and then your page number and mine is 76,

00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:15.490
and then dot entry,

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:18.685
dash title, so this is our page number.

00:10:18.685 --> 00:10:22.010
Then this is the class which points to our page title.

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:27.470
What we're going to do here is to set the display type to be none,

00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:29.630
semicolon at the end.

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:33.595
This will remove all title on only this Homepage,

00:10:33.595 --> 00:10:38.355
publish this, and back over to our site.

00:10:38.355 --> 00:10:40.695
Go back to the front end,

00:10:40.695 --> 00:10:43.520
and now we have a slider in place for our Homepage.

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:46.445
Also the page title has been removed.

00:10:46.445 --> 00:10:50.000
Now our site is looking more like an e-commerce store.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.650
