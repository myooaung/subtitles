00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:06.480
Welcome back guys. In this video we're going to concentrate on the sidebar.

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.855
Currently, if we go over to our blog section,

00:00:09.855 --> 00:00:12.825
displayed on the page there is two sidebars.

00:00:12.825 --> 00:00:16.665
First of all is a sidebar on the right hand side,

00:00:16.665 --> 00:00:19.650
which is being called from our index page.

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.580
It's the section that we pulled it from our static site.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.710
The second one, is being called from the get sidebar function.

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.655
This is being displayed right at the bottom of the page,

00:00:32.655 --> 00:00:38.895
which includes the recent posts, comments, archives, categories.

00:00:38.895 --> 00:00:44.125
If we go over to a file called sidebar.php,

00:00:44.125 --> 00:00:50.670
we can see that the sidebar is being generated from a sidebar called sidebar-1.

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:56.980
We can find the content of the sidebar by heading on to the dashboard widgets section.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:04.970
Go into the dashboard and select "Widgets" This is the sidebar section,

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.045
which is at the bottom of our blog page.

00:01:08.045 --> 00:01:14.370
Our sidebar from the finished website only includes the categories, and the office.

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:19.480
Let's get to work by deleting all the widgets except the categories.

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:26.885
Open up and then hit "Delete" recent posts can go,

00:01:26.885 --> 00:01:32.235
comments, and the metadata can go too.

00:01:32.235 --> 00:01:37.605
We're left with the archives and the categories.

00:01:37.605 --> 00:01:39.660
I'll go to the index page,

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:45.380
you can see the categories is the first one and then the archives.

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.200
Let's just rearrange these to be the same.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.675
Now we've tidied up the sidebar.

00:01:51.675 --> 00:01:57.425
If we go over to the index page and then use the get sidebar function.

00:01:57.425 --> 00:02:04.370
I'm going to click this and then place it inside our sidebar container.

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:08.940
Place it just below the div with the class of sticky.

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.345
Open up the php tags,

00:02:12.345 --> 00:02:17.020
paste in get sidebar, and then close.

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:27.135
Then save that, and then refresh our blog. Scroll down.

00:02:27.135 --> 00:02:30.705
We've got the categories and the archives.

00:02:30.705 --> 00:02:34.660
The first section is from the widgets that we just added,

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.150
and then the second section is plain HTML,

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.220
which is just from this section here.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.700
I'm going to delete this section in just a moment.

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.245
But first, I want to make sure that the styling

00:02:48.245 --> 00:02:51.535
for the widgets matches our finished website.

00:02:51.535 --> 00:02:57.450
To do this, I'm going to go over to our functions.php file,

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:05.890
and then I'm going to do a search for register underscore sidebar.

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.720
In my case it's on line 88.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.790
This is the sidebar that we want,

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.100
which is sidebar-1, and this is the one that we're currently working with.

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.615
There is also areas where we can add HTML,

00:03:22.615 --> 00:03:27.385
such as divs, sections, IDs and classes.

00:03:27.385 --> 00:03:32.825
We can place this before or after the widgets or even the title.

00:03:32.825 --> 00:03:37.025
Our widget titles such as archives,

00:03:37.025 --> 00:03:40.985
categories above level 4 headings.

00:03:40.985 --> 00:03:46.580
Let's change level 2 to be four.

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.940
This is before and after the title.

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.295
Save that and then refresh,

00:03:56.295 --> 00:03:58.020
and that looks more like it now.

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:05.565
In our case, all we needed to change was the level 4 heading for the title.

00:04:05.565 --> 00:04:07.360
If you got more complex sidebar,

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.170
you may need to go into the before and afterward widget,

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:16.985
and add different divs or different classes to make it much the original website.

00:04:16.985 --> 00:04:19.720
Now there is much [inaudible] we can go back into

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:25.030
the index page and delete the static HTML content.

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.785
Delete the first section,

00:04:27.785 --> 00:04:31.600
and also the archive section.

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.470
Let's tie this up a little bit, there we go.

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:41.325
That should remove the second sets and refresh.

00:04:41.325 --> 00:04:46.069
Great, now WordPress is pulling the categories and also the archives.

00:04:46.069 --> 00:04:52.735
We've now got the ability to click on the individual items and be taken to a page.

00:04:52.735 --> 00:04:58.320
For example, this one filters all the blog posts to a certain month.

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.080
The same if you had more than one category,

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.390
we'll get a list of different categories.

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:07.654
We could select one of those categories,

00:05:07.654 --> 00:05:10.450
WordPress will apply filters.

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:12.520
That's our sidebar now finished.

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.360
I will move on now to the next video.
