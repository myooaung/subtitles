00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:06.180
Now it's time to think about who is actually going to be using

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.250
our blog and also how much access each user actually has.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.745
When inside of the dashboard view just like this,

00:00:14.745 --> 00:00:19.225
you may have already noticed we have this "Users" option over on the left.

00:00:19.225 --> 00:00:23.555
If I hover over this, we have the option to go into all users,

00:00:23.555 --> 00:00:25.550
we can directly add a new one,

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.810
or we can go into our current profile.

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:30.940
Our current profile has some options,

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:32.510
such as changing the color scheme,

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:35.285
we can also update our personal information,

00:00:35.285 --> 00:00:38.330
our contact information, our profile picture,

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.150
and also reset the password too.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.400
But this video is not about those,

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.485
this about adding new users,

00:00:45.485 --> 00:00:48.785
and also checking out the different permissions they have too.

00:00:48.785 --> 00:00:52.195
Let's head over to the All users section.

00:00:52.195 --> 00:00:54.410
Up at the top we see our blog admin,

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.560
which is the one and only user which we have setup.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.340
We can also add a new name if we wanted to from the edit screen.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:02.885
We can see our e-mail.

00:01:02.885 --> 00:01:06.010
We also have this role of administrator.

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.950
An administrator is a user which has all of the required permissions

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.955
to do or to change anything they want to on this site.

00:01:13.955 --> 00:01:16.580
This is why we have all of these options on the left.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:17.750
We can delete, post,

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.160
we can add new pages,

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.710
we can approve comments,

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.530
and also change the look and feel of this site.

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.670
When we only have a single site,

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.440
just like we do here, this is the top level role.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.630
We've created two blog posts when in fact we've only actually created one.

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.445
But when we first setup WordPress,

00:01:35.445 --> 00:01:39.280
the "Hello world" example was assigned to our user too.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.790
This one, we added the sample data.

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.540
Also included with this data was two additional users.

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:51.125
The difference between these two and ourselves is this role of subscriber.

00:01:51.125 --> 00:01:54.455
We'll take a look at this in more detail in just a moment.

00:01:54.455 --> 00:01:57.320
Since we're currently logged in as the administrator,

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.715
we also have the power to be able to select any of these additional users.

00:02:01.715 --> 00:02:05.605
We can also go into the edit screen and change any of the details.

00:02:05.605 --> 00:02:09.500
Also, very importantly, we can change the current role too.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.980
If we wanted to have an additional administrator we could,

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.105
and also generally upgrade or downgrade any users role.

00:02:17.105 --> 00:02:19.130
Access all users if we wanted to,

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.770
we could also even remove users.

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.660
We do this in a similar way to when we dealt with the pages and blog posts.

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.060
All we need to do is to hover over any of these users and select

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:34.410
the "Delete" button or we can also apply these in bulk too by selecting multiple ones,

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.170
and then you see it drop down from above.

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.475
As we've just seen with the drop down in the edit screen,

00:02:40.475 --> 00:02:43.115
alongside the administrator and subscriber,

00:02:43.115 --> 00:02:46.280
we do have various other roles too.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.530
To find out more about these settings,

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.285
we can go over to our search engine and do a search for WordPress roles.

00:02:53.285 --> 00:02:56.555
My top search is from the WordPress.org site

00:02:56.555 --> 00:03:00.175
and it takes us directly into the roles and capabilities.

00:03:00.175 --> 00:03:03.090
Click on this, scroll down,

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.295
and then we'll see a summary of each one of these roles.

00:03:06.295 --> 00:03:09.910
I did mention before, when we have a single website like we do,

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.070
that the administrator is the top level role.

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:14.090
As we can see,

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.220
this is somebody who has access to all of

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.495
the administrative features within this one single site.

00:03:20.495 --> 00:03:23.600
However, though, as we'll find out later on in this course,

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:29.650
we can also create a WordPress network or a WordPress multi-site installation.

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:35.795
This type of WordPress setup also generates a new type of role called the super admin.

00:03:35.795 --> 00:03:38.960
A super admin is somebody who is responsible for all of

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:42.635
the administration features on the network of sites.

00:03:42.635 --> 00:03:45.875
We don't need to worry about this super admin just yet,

00:03:45.875 --> 00:03:49.975
all we need to focus on is the five roles just below.

00:03:49.975 --> 00:03:51.539
Just below the administrator,

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:53.400
we also have the editor.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.090
This editor also has some responsibility too.

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.350
They can also publish and also manage their own blog posts,

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:03.070
and also they post for other users too.

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:05.220
After this, we have the author.

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.565
This is somebody who can publish and manage

00:04:07.565 --> 00:04:12.205
only their own post and not any post from any other users.

00:04:12.205 --> 00:04:17.270
After this, we have a contributor who is somebody who can write their own posts,

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:22.135
but they cannot directly publish them without a confirmation from the administrator.

00:04:22.135 --> 00:04:25.730
Then finally, the lowest role is the subscriber.

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:31.265
This is just somebody who can sign up to our sites and also manage their own profile too.

00:04:31.265 --> 00:04:32.970
They can't create any content,

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.415
they can't manage any other people's content.

00:04:35.415 --> 00:04:39.759
All they can effectively do is sign up and change their user's details.

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:42.820
We can also see here that our administrator account has been

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.090
automatically created when we first setup WordPress.

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:47.560
Now, with this in mind,

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.790
we can manually add a new user to our site.

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:54.100
Head over to the dashboard and we have this "Add New" button at the top,

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:57.095
which we can also access from the sidebar too.

00:04:57.095 --> 00:05:05.060
I click on this and I'm going to add a sample test user and an e-mail.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.145
Just test for now, a terrible password.

00:05:11.145 --> 00:05:16.055
Of test 2, will confirm this is fine because we're just creating a sample user.

00:05:16.055 --> 00:05:18.470
Then at the bottom we can also change the role too,

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:21.110
which we want to leave as a subscriber,

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:27.190
which was the bottom level of roles. Confirm this.

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:29.970
A new user has been created.

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:32.720
We can also edit any of these details if we want.

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.180
But I'm going to now log out of

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:39.190
the administrator profile by hovering over this section in the corner.

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:44.075
Click on "Logout" and then we can login as our test user,

00:05:44.075 --> 00:05:49.225
which was test@test, a super-strong password.

00:05:49.225 --> 00:05:54.015
Log in, and now we're taken to our test user's profile.

00:05:54.015 --> 00:05:57.110
We have seen before from the roles and capabilities that

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:00.775
a subscriber can only manage their own profile.

00:06:00.775 --> 00:06:04.595
They don't have access to any of the other admin features,

00:06:04.595 --> 00:06:08.585
and this is why we don't see any of the admin features in the sidebar.

00:06:08.585 --> 00:06:14.705
We can't create any new posts or pages or generally have any input into the site.

00:06:14.705 --> 00:06:20.330
Also any content which is created needs to also be approved by the administrator too.

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:25.100
We can see this if we go over to our site and then refresh.

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:28.565
We see our user has been updated to our test.

00:06:28.565 --> 00:06:32.810
Head over to the homepage and select any one of these blog posts.

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:36.095
Remember that comments were enabled for this post.

00:06:36.095 --> 00:06:40.430
I'm going to leave a comment down at the bottom of "Hello",

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:43.045
then click on "Post".

00:06:43.045 --> 00:06:46.710
We have a message of "Your comment is awaiting moderation."

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:50.750
Since we don't have approval to post any content onto this site,

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:55.990
what we now need to do is to log back out of our own name.

00:06:55.990 --> 00:07:00.405
Logout and then log back in as our administrator,

00:07:00.405 --> 00:07:03.010
that was the blog admin.

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:08.735
Once again, we have access to all of our admin features.

00:07:08.735 --> 00:07:13.075
Then over on the left we can see we have four comments awaiting approval,

00:07:13.075 --> 00:07:14.985
head into this section.

00:07:14.985 --> 00:07:19.685
We can see including our sample data we have 34 comments in total,

00:07:19.685 --> 00:07:21.410
30 have been approved,

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:23.635
and we have four which is pending.

00:07:23.635 --> 00:07:25.860
Click on this too, filter this down,

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:28.340
and we have our test user's comments at the very

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:32.800
top alongside the three comments from the sample data.

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:36.000
We can either hover over these manually and approve.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.650
We can edit the content.

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:42.100
We can either remove this if we don't want this to be published onto our site,

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:45.485
or if we wanted to approve all of these comments at once,

00:07:45.485 --> 00:07:47.915
we're going to click on this checkbox.

00:07:47.915 --> 00:07:50.815
Into the "Bulk Actions" we can approve,

00:07:50.815 --> 00:07:55.885
apply this, and the four comments have now been approved.

00:07:55.885 --> 00:07:59.120
Over to our blog posts and refresh.

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:04.130
The hello comments has now been approved and is visible just below our blog post.

00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:06.270
By default, when we sign up our users,

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:08.810
we seen that this has the subscriber role.

00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:12.715
We can also change this inside of our settings if we wanted to,

00:08:12.715 --> 00:08:16.980
into the "Settings" option and then into "General".

00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:21.900
One of the options inside here is the "New Users Default Role";

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:24.510
currently, this is set to subscriber.

00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:28.400
What if we had a certain use case for a higher level of role?

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:31.750
We could also set this to be a different default too.

00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:35.390
Also as an administrator we also have lots more options to

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:39.345
control the settings of the discussion or the comments.

00:08:39.345 --> 00:08:42.820
Still inside the settings we have these discussions link,

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:47.575
and this really allows us to fine tune all these settings related to our comments.

00:08:47.575 --> 00:08:52.270
We can have things, such as e-mail confirmations when a new comment is posted.

00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:55.570
We can check if the author must fill out their name and e-mail.

00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:58.615
We can check if they need to be registered and logged in to comment.

00:08:58.615 --> 00:09:01.460
We can close comments after a certain amount of days,

00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:03.210
and also various other options too,

00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:08.550
such as blacklisting certain words which may be included in a comment. There we go.

00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:12.325
This is how we can manage different users on our WordPress website,

00:09:12.325 --> 00:09:14.770
how we can change permissions of a user,

00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:20.180
and how we can safely control the comments being posted onto our blog.
