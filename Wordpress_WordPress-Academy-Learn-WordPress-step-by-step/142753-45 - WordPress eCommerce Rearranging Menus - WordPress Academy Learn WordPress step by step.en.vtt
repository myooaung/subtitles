00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:05.350
At the moment, our header section,

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:07.855
it just has this one single menu,

00:00:07.855 --> 00:00:10.590
it has all of the links which have been provided by

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.920
default when adding the WooCommerce plug-in.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.070
A couple of things to know with this menu is, in the previous video,

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.960
when we created our Contact Us page,

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.720
this has not been automatically added.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.570
We still have the sample page which we need to remove.

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.625
We can also split this menu up into smaller menus if we want to.

00:00:29.625 --> 00:00:33.495
I'm going to break this up into two separate menus.

00:00:33.495 --> 00:00:35.220
One is going to be the user menu,

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:36.330
which will contain links,

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:37.575
such as the Accounts,

00:00:37.575 --> 00:00:40.605
the users' basket, and also the Checkout,

00:00:40.605 --> 00:00:44.555
and then another menu which is going to be more of a site navigation,

00:00:44.555 --> 00:00:47.120
and this will contain links to different pages on our site,

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.365
such as the Home,

00:00:48.365 --> 00:00:51.340
the Contact Us, and also the Shop.

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.650
First of all, let's review the sample page from

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:59.330
the Pages link and just remove this single page.

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.485
Then into Appearance and Menus.

00:01:02.485 --> 00:01:08.525
The first one, the first menu name is going to be the Navigation menu.

00:01:08.525 --> 00:01:11.915
This will be the primary menu location.

00:01:11.915 --> 00:01:14.900
This will be in place of this current menu just here, by this menu,

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:20.200
and then we can add the pages which we want to display.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.855
This, l can View All and I'm going to go for the Homepage.

00:01:24.855 --> 00:01:28.625
The Contact Us, which was a new page which we just created,

00:01:28.625 --> 00:01:31.090
and also the Shop page.

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.500
Add this. You can rearrange these if you prefer,

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.520
but I'm happy with this order. Save this.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.565
If we click on the "Live Preview" at the top,

00:01:41.565 --> 00:01:43.350
we'll be taken to the Customizer view,

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.775
which has the same options,

00:01:44.775 --> 00:01:47.720
where we can see all of these changes in real-time.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.665
There's all three new menu links in the primary location.

00:01:51.665 --> 00:01:56.225
I'm now going to create a new menu which is going to be at the top of our header,

00:01:56.225 --> 00:02:01.260
and this will contain the user related links. Create New.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.895
This one will be the User Menu location.

00:02:05.895 --> 00:02:09.540
This will be secondary, so this will appear at the top of the header,

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:14.530
and now we can get to work with adding our links. Add Items.

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.345
This is also going to link to some pages.

00:02:17.345 --> 00:02:19.520
I'm going to select the My Account,

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.485
the Checkout, and also the Shopping Cart too.

00:02:23.485 --> 00:02:27.315
As we click it on these, these are added to the top of our header section.

00:02:27.315 --> 00:02:28.845
We can publish this,

00:02:28.845 --> 00:02:30.990
and make these changes live.

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:32.730
Inside the menu locations,

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.320
we also have this handheld menu too.

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:40.665
This is a dedicated menu which we can display on the smaller screen devices.

00:02:40.665 --> 00:02:43.410
Click on the Mobile view just here.

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.770
Then we can add a dedicated Handheld Menu.

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.650
Go back. Create a new menu.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.670
Let's see, Mobile Menu.

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.090
This is in the Handheld location.

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.210
Next, and then we can add our items.

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:06.225
Please select all of the pages which are available. Publish our menu.

00:03:06.225 --> 00:03:07.860
Now over on the preview,

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.720
if you click on this, we can see all of the links which we have just selected.

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.940
You wanted to, you could also rearrange these.

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.690
It would make sense to have the home at the top.

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:22.075
Save these changes. This is now being reflected inside of our menu.

00:03:22.075 --> 00:03:26.885
The tablet screen, this also displays the same menu too.

00:03:26.885 --> 00:03:29.810
Then when we go to the larger screen devices,

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.585
our two separate menus are now displaying.

00:03:32.585 --> 00:03:37.105
Let's just refresh our store and check all these changes have been updated.

00:03:37.105 --> 00:03:40.290
There we go. There's our two separate menus,

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:45.575
though in most themes we don't need to stick to the default menu or the default location.

00:03:45.575 --> 00:03:49.640
We can often place in multiple menus in different locations.

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.730
Next, we'll move on to editing the footer area.
