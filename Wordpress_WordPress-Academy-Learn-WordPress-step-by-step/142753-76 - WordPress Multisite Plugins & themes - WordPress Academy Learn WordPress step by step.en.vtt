00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:07.260
We're going to start this video by looking at adding themes to our network.

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:10.920
This need to be installed by the super administrator

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.225
and can either be made available to all sites on the network,

00:00:15.225 --> 00:00:17.985
or on a site by site basis.

00:00:17.985 --> 00:00:20.745
We will look up plugins too in this video,

00:00:20.745 --> 00:00:23.685
but we'll begin by looking at the themes.

00:00:23.685 --> 00:00:29.445
One thing you may find useful for this video and also for the next couple of videos,

00:00:29.445 --> 00:00:32.445
is I've logged in as two users.

00:00:32.445 --> 00:00:36.360
On the right-hand side, I've opened up a different browser.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.045
In my case I'm using Firefox,

00:00:39.045 --> 00:00:45.660
and I've used this to login as the Laptop Shop or one of our Network Admins.

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.920
You may find it a lot easier to have a second browse

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.910
open and logged in as one of the network sites.

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.625
Using the normal Chrome browser,

00:00:55.625 --> 00:00:58.510
I'm logged in as the super administrator.

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.495
So we can switch between the two,

00:01:00.495 --> 00:01:03.855
we don't need to login or logout all the time.

00:01:03.855 --> 00:01:06.680
First, let's take a look at how to enable

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.610
a theme to be available for the whole of the network.

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.039
As the super administrator,

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:18.065
if I go to the Dashboard and then My Sites, Network Admin,

00:01:18.065 --> 00:01:20.760
and then down to Themes,

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:27.540
we've got the list of available themes and also the options Add New.

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.320
I'll just go into there and you can search for anything I like,

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:39.750
so I'm just going to search for the Storefront theme that we've used in this course.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.300
This is one from the e-commerce projects.

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.780
I'll just hover over that and then click "Install".

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:58.450
Once that's done, you'll know is that the Install button changes to Network Enable.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.055
This button makes a theme available to all sites on the network,

00:02:04.055 --> 00:02:06.540
so let's click on that.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:14.160
We're taken back to the list of available themes.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.340
There's our Storefront theme that we've just enabled,

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.490
and we've also got the option to network

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:22.735
disable if we ever want to do that in the future.

00:02:22.735 --> 00:02:27.665
Also the same with all the sites which are installed by default,

00:02:27.665 --> 00:02:32.125
we've also got the option to enable and disable those.

00:02:32.125 --> 00:02:36.785
If we want to just add a theme to be enabled for certain sites,

00:02:36.785 --> 00:02:38.795
we can also do that too.

00:02:38.795 --> 00:02:41.790
If we go back to Add New,

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.730
and again just choose extra theme,

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.980
we go for the spacious theme from the first project,

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.140
and then once it's found,

00:02:54.140 --> 00:03:02.075
hit "Install," but this time we don't click on Network Enable,

00:03:02.075 --> 00:03:06.130
because we just want this to be available for certain sites.

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.590
Now it's installed. If we go back to the Network Admin,

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.630
and then to our list of sites,

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:22.300
if we go down to our Laptop Shop and then go on to Edit,

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.960
and then select the Themes tab,

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:35.135
I'll make a list of the available themes which we can enable for the site.

00:03:35.135 --> 00:03:38.570
It's at the top, we say is network enabled themes.

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:40.435
They are not shown on the screen.

00:03:40.435 --> 00:03:43.730
That's for obvious reasons because the theme has

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:46.745
already been made available for all sites on the network,

00:03:46.745 --> 00:03:49.855
so we don't need to enable it from this screen.

00:03:49.855 --> 00:03:59.135
For the Laptop Shop, let's enable the spacious theme. Now that's done.

00:03:59.135 --> 00:04:02.400
If we go to our second browser,

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.290
let's go to Appearance and then Themes,

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:11.850
we've got the default 2017 theme,

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.040
we've got the Storefront theme,

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.055
which is being network enable for all sites,

00:04:17.055 --> 00:04:19.980
and we've also enable the spacious theme.

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:26.880
Let's just try and disable the spacious theme as the super admin,

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.260
and then try refreshing and have it go.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:36.815
Now we only have available the default theme and the network enabled theme.

00:04:36.815 --> 00:04:39.530
This is a way to control exactly which

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:43.565
theme we want to have available for any given site.

00:04:43.565 --> 00:04:47.055
Let's now take a look at adding plugins to our network,

00:04:47.055 --> 00:04:49.190
and just like when using themes,

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:53.455
plugins need to also be installed by the super admin.

00:04:53.455 --> 00:04:58.630
First, let's begin by activating a plugin for the whole network,

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:02.030
so back over to our main admin.

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:05.970
You've got go to My Sites and then Network Admin.

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:08.580
There's also a Plugins option,

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:14.535
so we just go into there and in a similar way to before,

00:05:14.535 --> 00:05:16.990
click on "Add New".

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:23.715
Now for this demonstration I'm going to go for the Jetpack plugin.

00:05:23.715 --> 00:05:26.710
I'll search for Jetpack,

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:30.360
and this is what we want by Automattic,

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.770
and then Install Now.

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:38.010
Just give a moment to install.

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:45.610
Then once that's done, we get the same Network Activate button. I'll click on that.

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:51.510
Then we're taken back to our list of plugins.

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:54.015
In each one of the installed plugins,

00:05:54.015 --> 00:05:59.190
we've also got the option to Network Activate or Network Deactivate.

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:02.865
Now this particular plugin is network activated.

00:06:02.865 --> 00:06:05.370
It's available for all sites on the network,

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:09.640
but it cannot be removed by the individual site administrators.

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.910
Let's go back over to you,

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:15.700
our Laptop Shop and then refresh.

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:21.405
Now in the dashboard, we have the Jetpack plugin option,

00:06:21.405 --> 00:06:24.720
as we will do on all the network sites.

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:29.540
This is ideal if we want the plugin to be available for all sites on the network.

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:33.230
But if we just want a plugin enabled on some other sites,

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:35.855
we need to do things slightly differently.

00:06:35.855 --> 00:06:38.830
Back over to the super admin,

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:43.590
let's install a new plugin by going to Add New.

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:50.860
I'm going to add a plugin called Advanced Custom Fields,

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:56.835
and then search for that.

00:06:56.835 --> 00:06:59.070
I'll just install it,

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:05.520
but this time, once it's all done we won't click on the Network Activate button.

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:10.235
We can activate this plugin on an individual site by site basis,

00:07:10.235 --> 00:07:12.835
by going over to My Sites.

00:07:12.835 --> 00:07:16.325
Then if we go down to one of the sites under our control,

00:07:16.325 --> 00:07:21.090
so let's go to the Phone Shop and then click on the "Dashboard".

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:24.780
We can go down to the Plugins,

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:30.155
and then there's the Advanced Custom Fields plugin

00:07:30.155 --> 00:07:32.930
which you have the option of activating.

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:38.540
Once that's activated, it's only enabled on the one website which we've activated it for.

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:41.095
In our case, it's the Phone Shop.

00:07:41.095 --> 00:07:44.235
Some of you may notice if we go to My Sites,

00:07:44.235 --> 00:07:49.450
we only have the Multisite and the Phone Shop available under our control.

00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:53.360
There's no option there to go to the dashboard of the Laptop Shop.

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:59.045
This is because we need to add ourself as an administrator for the Laptop Shop.

00:07:59.045 --> 00:08:02.770
Now we can easily do this by going to the Network Admin,

00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:05.380
and going down to Sites.

00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:15.700
If you go to the Laptop Shop and click on "Edit," we can go to the Users tab at the top,

00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:22.820
and then all we need to do is go to Add Existing User, and the username.

00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:25.610
In my case it's the multisite,

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:29.490
so I'll just click on there and give itself a role,

00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:33.490
so I'm going on to Administrator, Add User.

00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:37.880
Now if we go to My Sites, at the top,

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:42.005
we've now got full control of our all three sites on our network.

00:08:42.005 --> 00:08:44.900
This will also enable us to go into the dashboard

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:48.715
and enable plugins for each individual sites.

00:08:48.715 --> 00:08:51.965
This can only be doing as the super admin.

00:08:51.965 --> 00:08:55.455
As you can see if we go over to the Laptop Shop,

00:08:55.455 --> 00:08:58.045
just as the standard administrator,

00:08:58.045 --> 00:09:02.000
we don't have the option in the dashboard to select the plugins,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.150
like we do over on the left-hand side.

00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:09.280
Now we're also administrator on the Laptop Shop.

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:12.010
We have the option to now go to My Sites.

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:14.875
You see the Laptop Shop is now enabled,

00:09:14.875 --> 00:09:20.300
which will allow us to go into the dashboard and we can do things like add the plugins.

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:22.935
Let's go to the Plugins,

00:09:22.935 --> 00:09:28.930
and let's add the Advanced Custom Fields and activate that.

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:34.770
Then go back over to the Laptop Shop, and then refresh.

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:38.345
Because we just logged in as an administrator,

00:09:38.345 --> 00:09:41.585
we don't have the plugins option in the dashboard.

00:09:41.585 --> 00:09:46.575
However, we do have the Jetpack and now also the Custom Fields plugin,

00:09:46.575 --> 00:09:51.885
because this has been enabled by the super admin. That's pretty much it.

00:09:51.885 --> 00:09:57.070
That's a insight into how we can add themes and plugins for our network.

00:09:57.070 --> 00:10:00.590
Now let's move on to the next video where I'll show you how to

00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:05.070
allow registered users to add websites to our network.
