00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:03.870
Welcome back guys. In this video,

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.820
we're going to take a look at how we can activate our WordPress multisite.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.760
As I mentioned at the start of the section,

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.480
I'm going to be using a live hosting account from Bluehost.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.675
Of course, you can use any host which you prefer.

00:00:18.675 --> 00:00:22.920
But I want to be going through these videos with a Bluehost account.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.470
If you are using a different hosting provider,

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.180
you may need to take one or two different steps just to follow along.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:35.715
But a lot of different hosting providers have a one-click WordPress installation.

00:00:35.715 --> 00:00:39.910
Hopefully, you shouldn't have too much problem by following along.

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.385
I'm currently logged into the account.

00:00:43.385 --> 00:00:45.890
Inside the Bluehost admin panel,

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.175
there's a convenient WordPress tools app,

00:00:49.175 --> 00:00:52.050
which we click on at the top.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.680
Then once you're inside of the WordPress tools,

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.650
we need to click on the "New Install",

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:03.115
and you should be given a choice to select a domain name.

00:01:03.115 --> 00:01:09.600
I've got available domain admin name called the reactacademycause.com.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.050
I want to be installing WordPress onto this domain.

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.840
The path you can leave as blank unless you want to

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.380
add a sub folder to install WordPress inside.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.675
But I'm just going to leave it on the main domain.

00:01:25.675 --> 00:01:31.850
The site title, and all the rest of the options are pretty self-explanatory.

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.390
The site title, I should call mine Multisite.

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.385
For the purposes of the demonstration,

00:01:40.385 --> 00:01:42.680
I want to add a simple username and

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:49.060
password of multisite and multisite for the password too.

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.150
Of course, live websites will need a stronger password.

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.280
Then add in your e-mail,

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.520
and then we need to click "Install WordPress".

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.120
This just take a few moments to install,

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:12.920
and this is just a standard WordPress installation,

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.620
like we'll be looking out for the rest of the course.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.295
It's no different from the first three projects which we created,

00:02:22.295 --> 00:02:26.480
but we will be converting it into a multisite very soon.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.850
But for now, click on "Refresh".

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:38.160
That should be it,

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.375
that's our WordPress installed onto our own domain.

00:02:42.375 --> 00:02:46.720
To test, I'm just going to go over to the URL,

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.670
and then we need to go to login.

00:02:54.410 --> 00:03:01.990
I select multisite, multisite too, then login.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.725
That means we're all ready to go.

00:03:10.725 --> 00:03:13.895
We've got the dashboard or the back end of WordPress,

00:03:13.895 --> 00:03:16.490
which you should all be familiar with now.

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:20.940
I'm just going to click on, I don't need any help just for now,

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.320
just to get rid of that page.

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.820
I will go search the WordPress dashboard.

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:34.015
If click on the home icon in the top left,

00:03:34.015 --> 00:03:37.410
will then take in to our homepage.

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.020
It's just a blank homepage for now.

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:47.090
Now I've got a successful WordPress installation.

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.134
Now to turn this into a multisite,

00:03:50.134 --> 00:03:53.215
we need to find some of the files to edit.

00:03:53.215 --> 00:03:56.370
If we go back over to our hosting provider,

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.640
and if we go over to the hosting tab,

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:07.360
and then I'm going to go into the cPanel, which is just below.

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:10.520
Your hosting provider again,

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:11.915
might be slightly different,

00:04:11.915 --> 00:04:15.050
so we just find a way into the cPanel.

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:21.135
Then I'm going to scroll down to the final section, which is just here.

00:04:21.135 --> 00:04:24.430
Then I click on the "File Manager",

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:30.070
then all files for all WordPress are in public_html.

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:38.600
We should see some files and folders which are familiar from our localhost sections.

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:43.580
The first thing we need to do is find the wp-config file.

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:50.660
If we scroll down and find wp.config.php.

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:57.235
I'm going to highlight this file and then go up to the top where there's a code editor.

00:04:57.235 --> 00:05:02.690
Click on that and then select edit.

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:09.205
Now we'll open up the contents of the config file.

00:05:09.205 --> 00:05:12.370
The first step we need to do is to scroll down,

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:14.850
and then we need to find the line which says,

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:17.190
that's all, stop editing.

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:21.160
Just above this line, we need to type in a line of code.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:29.985
Begin with define within a set brackets and the quotations.

00:05:29.985 --> 00:05:38.445
I'm going to type in WP_ALLOW_MULTISITE, and then a comma,

00:05:38.445 --> 00:05:44.625
and then we're going to set this to true with semicolon at the end,

00:05:44.625 --> 00:05:51.000
and then click on the "Save" button at the top to save the file,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.235
and then just close out.

00:05:53.235 --> 00:05:57.360
Then now last one, we're going to head over to our website,

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.070
and then click on "Refresh".

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:04.680
Then one touchstone, head over to tools,

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.755
you should see a new option appear,

00:06:06.755 --> 00:06:09.005
which is network setup.

00:06:09.005 --> 00:06:15.855
Click on that, and this takes us to the network set up.

00:06:15.855 --> 00:06:20.230
The first thing we need to do is deactivate the plugins.

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:24.360
Just click on the link, which is there.

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:29.950
I've only got one plug-in to deactivate, so just click on that.

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:37.170
Then once that's done, we can head back over to our networks app inside the tools.

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:40.505
Now we've got a different screen.

00:06:40.505 --> 00:06:43.945
We're now on the network installation process.

00:06:43.945 --> 00:06:50.435
We've got some options where we need to decide on the URL structure of our website.

00:06:50.435 --> 00:06:54.350
For this demonstration, I'm going to be using subdirectories.

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:56.330
I'll make sure that's selected on there.

00:06:56.330 --> 00:07:02.645
A subdirectory is our own URL followed by a forward slash,

00:07:02.645 --> 00:07:04.885
and then the name of our website.

00:07:04.885 --> 00:07:06.580
You can have subdomains,

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:09.590
which is just like the demonstration above,

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:14.184
where we'll have the name of the site followed by our URL.

00:07:14.184 --> 00:07:17.600
If you didn't want to use the subdomains option,

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:21.380
you may need to activate wildcard subdomains.

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:24.620
To do this, you may need to check with your hosting provider or

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:28.690
the documentation for instructions of how to do this.

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:31.950
But for now, I'm going to click on subdirectories.

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:38.300
However, be aware this option is only available on new WordPress installations.

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:41.765
If your installation is one month older,

00:07:41.765 --> 00:07:47.010
you'd be forced to use the subdomains option. Just bear that in mind.

00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:52.570
Scrolling down is going to keep the network title as multisite sites,

00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:56.170
and then click on "Install".

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:03.005
Now WordPress gives us some lines of code which you need to add,

00:08:03.005 --> 00:08:07.370
first of all to the wp-config file which we looked at before,

00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:10.405
and then the htaccess file.

00:08:10.405 --> 00:08:13.605
Begin inside the config file,

00:08:13.605 --> 00:08:18.020
let's click on the lines of code which needs at,

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:20.320
and then copy these.

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:28.310
Then go back into our File Manager and then edit the file wp-config.php.

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:36.990
Click on "Edit", and then scroll back down just as before too, that's all.

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:43.600
Then paste this in and then click on "Save".

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:47.070
Search the first button,

00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:51.720
and the next we need to add some code to the htaccess file.

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:58.105
Copy the code and then head back over to the File Manager.

00:08:58.105 --> 00:09:00.790
Then with inside the public_HTML,

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:07.655
one problem which you may find is by default the htaccess file is not visible.

00:09:07.655 --> 00:09:10.990
You may need to check with your hosting provider for

00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:14.210
details of how to find the htaccess file.

00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:16.040
If you are using Bluehost,

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:17.755
which also hides the file,

00:09:17.755 --> 00:09:21.625
you can add a string to the end of the URL,

00:09:21.625 --> 00:09:24.325
which is the ampersand symbol.

00:09:24.325 --> 00:09:31.175
Then show hidden equals one, and then return.

00:09:31.175 --> 00:09:35.260
Then you should find inside the public file,

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:41.390
there's our htaccess, click on that, and then edit.

00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:46.880
Then the code which we've just copied,

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:52.400
we need to paste in between the IF module and then end in IF module tags.

00:09:52.400 --> 00:10:01.210
Delete all of the defaults and then paste in what we just copied, click on "Save".

00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:05.000
Then now if all goes well,

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.910
we should be able to go over to our domain,

00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:16.200
hit "Refresh", and then login.

00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:21.815
Then once you're back inside of the dashboard,

00:10:21.815 --> 00:10:23.630
we shall have a new option at the top,

00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:26.130
which is my sites.

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:32.885
Congratulations if you have my sites appearing on the top of the navigation.

00:10:32.885 --> 00:10:35.285
This means that the network setup was

00:10:35.285 --> 00:10:39.665
a success and you now have access to the network admin.

00:10:39.665 --> 00:10:42.500
Now you've got access to the network admin.

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:44.290
We'll leave this video there.

00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:46.650
We'll move on now to the next video,

00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:50.640
we'll take a look at how we can add sites to our network.
