00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.370
We're going to now do a little bit more customization with our project header.

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:14.455
Also, add this header image which you can see inside of the spacious theme preview.

00:00:14.455 --> 00:00:18.940
The header image is this large background image with this book and this phone,

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:21.175
which appears at the top of our website.

00:00:21.175 --> 00:00:25.420
It's ideal for branding and gives our website a unique look and feel.

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.680
This can also be done over in the dashboard inside of the customizer.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.840
Back to the appearance and into

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.240
the customizer section where we're going to jump in to the header.

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.860
To change these images we need to go into the header media section where we

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.480
can upload a new video or a new header image.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.790
We could play a video in the background if we wanted to,

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.684
or link to a YouTube URL.

00:00:48.684 --> 00:00:51.520
Instead, I'm going to go for the header image.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:56.740
Click on "Add New Image" where we can upload a new one or jump into the Media Library.

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:00.260
The image I'm going to use is this one just here.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.715
Select this and we can also crop the size if we'd like or click on "Crop".

00:01:05.715 --> 00:01:08.620
This one will be uploaded at the top of our project.

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.155
We can also add multiple images too.

00:01:11.155 --> 00:01:13.810
There is a second one provided with this course.

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.390
This is computer image just here.

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.860
Again, select and crop.

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.820
From the customizer, we can see this is the current header and we

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.875
also have some previously uploaded ones too.

00:01:24.875 --> 00:01:28.090
If we wanted to, we could stick with one single image,

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.300
or instead, we can click on "Randomized uploaded headers".

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.630
Then a random one displays each time the page has loaded.

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.080
By default, this is appearing above our header section.

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.630
We can move this just below by clicking on

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.930
"Position below" inside of this section at the bottom.

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.905
If we now publish these changes and go over to our site, refresh.

00:01:48.905 --> 00:01:51.040
If we keep refreshing the browser we see

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.835
a random image is selected each time the page loads up.

00:01:54.835 --> 00:01:57.730
We will also come back to this header image later on in

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:01.250
the project where we are going to replace this with a carousel.

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:02.875
Now, this is fine.

00:02:02.875 --> 00:02:05.050
Let's go back over to the customizer.

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.950
If we go back one level into the header section,

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.105
we can also click into the primary menu too.

00:02:11.105 --> 00:02:15.065
From here, we're going to enable the search icon in the header.

00:02:15.065 --> 00:02:18.890
This will give us a search box which we can search for any blog post,

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.630
or page on our sites.

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.930
For example, we've included some Lorem Ipsum.

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.640
If we search for this,

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.680
we'll see this will then return back our blog post with the text of Lorem.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.730
We can also change this to be the new responsive menu too.

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.555
For this, we drop down the size of the browser.

00:02:38.555 --> 00:02:42.125
This is what the regular drop-down menu looks like.

00:02:42.125 --> 00:02:46.205
If we wanted to, we could also switch the new responsive menu,

00:02:46.205 --> 00:02:49.910
which is appearing over the top right, just like this.

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.370
The choice of menu is completely up to you,

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.645
but I want to leave this as unchecked and then publish our changes.

00:02:56.645 --> 00:02:58.830
Now we've got these really wide images,

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.775
I'm going to go back to the global settings and into the layout.

00:03:02.775 --> 00:03:06.310
Where I'm going to is switch this back to the box layout.

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.965
This will just stop the image from becoming a lot wider than the rest of the content.

00:03:11.965 --> 00:03:15.870
Publish our changes, refresh the browser.

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.105
Our changes have now been updated.

00:03:18.105 --> 00:03:22.860
In the next video, we'll take a look at how to add a background image.
