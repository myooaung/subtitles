00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:06.030
We're going to begin with a simple project to get us used to how

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:09.630
WordPress works including setting up pages,

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.020
including themes and adding general content.

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:17.595
Let's take a look at what we're going to build during this section.

00:00:17.595 --> 00:00:21.240
This is going to be my version of the project,

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.735
which is going to be a landing page for a music festival.

00:00:24.735 --> 00:00:28.215
You can follow along and create this exact version

00:00:28.215 --> 00:00:32.265
or you can make it your own too by using a different theme or design.

00:00:32.265 --> 00:00:35.635
If you were just starting out and are brand new to WordPress,

00:00:35.635 --> 00:00:39.800
you may want to follow along with the same steps in design which I've

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:45.370
created then possibly customize at the end when you feel more comfortable doing so.

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.515
This is the project we're going to build in this section.

00:00:48.515 --> 00:00:51.065
It includes a navigation bar at the top.

00:00:51.065 --> 00:00:55.595
We're only going to create a landing page so we only have one menu link.

00:00:55.595 --> 00:00:58.685
We're also going to create our site title at the very top.

00:00:58.685 --> 00:01:01.970
We'll have some social media links on the left-hand side,

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.955
which you can use to link to your profiles.

00:01:04.955 --> 00:01:09.365
We'll have a full size background image in the header section.

00:01:09.365 --> 00:01:11.600
Then scrolling down, we're going to make use of

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:17.580
WordPress's new editor to create all of the layout and content for our homepage.

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.145
We're going to create different rows and blocks of content using this editor.

00:01:22.145 --> 00:01:28.375
Learning how to add different types of content such as images, galleries, and lists.

00:01:28.375 --> 00:01:31.235
We'll also find out how to lay things out in

00:01:31.235 --> 00:01:35.980
different columns so we can structure our content exactly how we would like.

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.800
We'll also discover how to use things such as the Media Library,

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.815
how to include widgets for blocks of content,

00:01:42.815 --> 00:01:45.670
and also how to set a bow theme.

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.610
We're going to kick things off by adding this theme in the next video.
