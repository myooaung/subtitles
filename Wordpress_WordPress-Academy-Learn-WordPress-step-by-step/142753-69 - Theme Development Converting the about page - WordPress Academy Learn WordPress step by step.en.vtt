00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.550
Welcome guys. In this video,

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.070
we're going to create the about us page.

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:08.235
This page has a lot of similarities to the homepage,

00:00:08.235 --> 00:00:11.280
such as the navigation section at the top,

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:18.945
the main image, the section which has the different ranges of headphones available,

00:00:18.945 --> 00:00:21.765
and the footer area at the bottom.

00:00:21.765 --> 00:00:24.780
But with just a little content added in between,

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:30.165
such as the about us title and also the paragraphs of text in between.

00:00:30.165 --> 00:00:34.035
Let's get to work by going over to our theme.

00:00:34.035 --> 00:00:37.440
We're going to create a new page template.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.040
This is going to be called page-about.php.

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:45.400
If you remember from earlier videos,

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.570
we looked at the template called page.php,

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:54.085
which is the generic fallback template for displaying all pages.

00:00:54.085 --> 00:00:57.355
But we're going to create a more specific template

00:00:57.355 --> 00:01:01.400
by creating new file called page-about.php.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.780
Because of the similarities to the homepage,

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.745
I'm going to begin by copying all the contents of the front page.

00:01:15.745 --> 00:01:18.455
Select all and copy,

00:01:18.455 --> 00:01:22.390
and then paste this into our page about.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.605
We need to keep the footer area,

00:01:25.605 --> 00:01:30.515
and then I'm going to scroll to the top of the page and add a comment.

00:01:30.515 --> 00:01:33.780
Just below the open php tag,

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.270
open up a php comments,

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.370
and then add a template name.

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:48.580
Template name: This is about us,

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.055
and the star and then closing slash.

00:01:53.055 --> 00:01:56.185
This name will be the template name,

00:01:56.185 --> 00:01:59.975
which you can select when you create the about us page in the dashboard.

00:01:59.975 --> 00:02:02.430
Let's go ahead and do that now.

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.130
Go over to the dashboard,

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.860
and then go to a new page.

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.990
I'm going to call this page About, and then the template.

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.680
I'm going to select the about us template that we just created,

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.600
and then hit "Publish."

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:33.220
Then let's go over to visit site and our link has been automatically added to the menu.

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.170
Click on the "about us" page.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.930
Currently we just have the same layout as the homepage.

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.510
Next we need to copy over the about us heading,

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.410
and also the paragraphs of text from the static sign.

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.900
Go over to the static templates,

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:57.010
and then go to about.html, scroll down.

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.965
We need to copy the column section,

00:02:59.965 --> 00:03:05.995
which is this dev , and this contains the about us heading, copy that,

00:03:05.995 --> 00:03:07.990
and then scrolling down,

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:18.625
copy the row which contains all the text and also the two closing devs just after it.

00:03:18.625 --> 00:03:27.160
Copy that and go back over to our theme into the page about.php,

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.990
and then this section goes just below the header.

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:36.630
Paste in below the get header function, and then save.

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:41.850
Let's check this out by hitting "Refresh."

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.255
That's it. Over the header section,

00:03:45.255 --> 00:03:47.580
we've got the about us heading,

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.610
we've got all the paragraphs of text,

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.605
the section with the various models,

00:03:53.605 --> 00:03:56.340
and then the footer area at the bottom.

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:00.285
That's the about us page all finished,

00:04:00.285 --> 00:04:02.495
and if you come back in the next video,

00:04:02.495 --> 00:04:05.345
we'll add some finishing touches to our sites,

00:04:05.345 --> 00:04:09.720
as well as making the search box function within WordPress.
