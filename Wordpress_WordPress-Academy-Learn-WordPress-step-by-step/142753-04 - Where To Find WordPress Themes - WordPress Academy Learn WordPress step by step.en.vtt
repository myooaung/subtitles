00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:07.465
This course doesn't require any purchases for a theme or any additional software.

00:00:07.465 --> 00:00:09.975
Though at some point in the future,

00:00:09.975 --> 00:00:13.020
you may be using WordPress to build lots and lots of sites,

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:14.460
whether that's for a job,

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.679
or paying clients, or for businesses.

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:22.625
For this use case, you may also want to look at some premium theme options.

00:00:22.625 --> 00:00:26.935
One of the options for this is themeforest.net.

00:00:26.935 --> 00:00:31.295
This is a marketplace for not only WordPress themes,

00:00:31.295 --> 00:00:33.724
but also money of a code, snippets,

00:00:33.724 --> 00:00:37.060
photos, and also videos too.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:43.010
We're going to be focusing on the WordPress themes which we can go to from this tab.

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.355
From here, we can check out all of the different categories,

00:00:46.355 --> 00:00:50.240
we can also search using the search bar up at the very top and there is

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.710
generally themes available for

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.720
pretty much any type of WordPress site which you want to create.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.155
For example, if we want to create a wedding website,

00:01:00.155 --> 00:01:02.630
we can do a search, and the wedding search

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:06.215
returns over a thousand different themes to choose from.

00:01:06.215 --> 00:01:10.380
As I mentioned, it's mostly paid content on this site,

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.065
but this price also does often include support too.

00:01:14.065 --> 00:01:18.410
It is also many people and companies making a full-time living,

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:23.255
creating themes and selling them on marketplaces just like this.

00:01:23.255 --> 00:01:26.345
If we go back to the popular items,

00:01:26.345 --> 00:01:30.380
we can see some of the popular themes such as the Avada theme,

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.215
this is currently one of the most popular themes

00:01:33.215 --> 00:01:36.025
and it has hundreds of thousands of sales.

00:01:36.025 --> 00:01:38.900
We can take a look at the live preview and see exactly how

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.070
this theme will look with various layouts,

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.795
we can scroll through any of these themes and check out

00:01:44.795 --> 00:01:47.945
all the features which comes with it and generally,

00:01:47.945 --> 00:01:52.755
many of these themes have lots of different options for layouts or changing the color

00:01:52.755 --> 00:01:55.430
and they're also very flexible too so we can use it

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.400
for product pages such as e-commerce sites,

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.650
we can use it for blogs and also personal sites too.

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:07.190
Along with seeing how our website will look and feel with a particular theme,

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.935
it's also very important too to check out all of the information which is listed below.

00:02:12.935 --> 00:02:16.475
We want to make sure our theme is regularly updated,

00:02:16.475 --> 00:02:19.310
we want to make sure that it got good reviews and

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.805
also it's compossible with our version of WordPress.

00:02:22.805 --> 00:02:26.345
When choosing a theme, it's not just about how it looks,

00:02:26.345 --> 00:02:30.365
it's also about the features and the things we can do with it too.

00:02:30.365 --> 00:02:35.740
One of the good indications of the features is the tags which is down at the bottom.

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:40.865
These tags will often reflect exactly what features is included with a theme,

00:02:40.865 --> 00:02:43.430
such as the number of layout options,

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.170
if it's going to have a two column layout,

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.065
if it's going have a three column layout,

00:02:47.065 --> 00:02:50.685
if it's compatible with WooCommerce for e-commerce stores,

00:02:50.685 --> 00:02:53.350
if it's translation ready and also what

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:56.795
customizations are available for this particular theme.

00:02:56.795 --> 00:03:01.240
We can also see exactly what browsers this is compatible with and also

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:06.320
which versions of WordPress plug-ins are also compatible with this theme too.

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.040
This particular one is also widget ready too,

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.620
which means we can enable widgets which are

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.625
self-contained pieces of content which we can place on our site,

00:03:15.625 --> 00:03:19.055
as well as all of the paid themes which are available on the site.

00:03:19.055 --> 00:03:21.055
As we looked at earlier, the official

00:03:21.055 --> 00:03:25.790
wordpress.org website also has a themes option at the top.

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.920
There also is paid themes from this commercial section but we

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.385
are only going to be focusing on the three themes which we have listed here.

00:03:34.385 --> 00:03:37.090
We can download any of these themes from

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.635
the WordPress dashboard and we're going to do this when we setup our first project.

00:03:41.635 --> 00:03:44.275
Just like the themes which we just looked at,

00:03:44.275 --> 00:03:47.200
we're going to be able to click into any of these themes,

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.209
we can check out a preview

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:55.195
and this will give us an idea of how our theme will look with some blog content.

00:03:55.195 --> 00:03:57.175
Again, it's also worth checking out

00:03:57.175 --> 00:04:01.060
all the additional information such as the last time it was updated,

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.890
the reviews and ratings,

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:04.790
and also the tags too.

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:07.420
We can see this one is accessibility ready,

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.810
it's got various customizations such as the background,

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:12.610
the colors, the logo,

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:15.350
the header, and also the menu.

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:19.365
It's e-commerce compatible, its translation ready,

00:04:19.365 --> 00:04:24.880
and also has various layout such as a one column and also a two column layout.

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.055
These are really important things to consider for your site

00:04:28.055 --> 00:04:31.040
but don't worry just yet about selecting themes with

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.680
all of these tag options because we going to discover

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.360
exactly what most of these are as we progress through the course.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.420
Having all of these themes available for WordPress allows us to

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:46.090
decouple the content which we have on our sites with the look and feel.

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:50.555
Even if we have a blog which we call hundreds and thousands of blog posts,

00:04:50.555 --> 00:04:53.300
down the line we can also completely change the look

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.410
and feel by simply switching the theme.

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:00.350
This theme will not affect the original content and we still

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:03.800
have all of this information still available and most of

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.810
these themes are generally customizable from

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:10.910
the WordPress dashboard as well as downloading themes like this.

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:13.775
We can also create our own custom themes,

00:05:13.775 --> 00:05:17.180
we can either use these themes for personal use,

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:18.740
for a paying client,

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:22.500
or we could also upload them back to the theme store.

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:25.760
As with everything, if you do a search online,

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:28.400
there will be hundreds or even thousands of

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.745
options which you can choose from but for now though,

00:05:31.745 --> 00:05:34.130
we're going to come back to our themes and

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:36.905
take a look at how we can add these to our sites.

00:05:36.905 --> 00:05:41.700
First of all, we need to take a look at how to install WordPress.
