00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:05.720
With all this in place, we now have all the information which we need

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.660
to go ahead and create our own products for the store.

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:13.225
Over to the dashboard and into the Products option on the left.

00:00:13.225 --> 00:00:15.870
As we already know, we have all these options which were

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.945
created with the WooCommerce sample data.

00:00:18.945 --> 00:00:20.670
To edit or remove this,

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.380
all we need to do is to hover over any of

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.935
these products just like we do with a page or a blog post.

00:00:25.935 --> 00:00:28.065
This then reveals the options just below.

00:00:28.065 --> 00:00:32.355
These products also have a stock keeping unit which is a product code.

00:00:32.355 --> 00:00:34.980
We have a in-stock flag just here,

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.280
and this is created because WooCommerce also allows stock management.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.660
We can set up a quantity for each one of

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.180
our items and WooCommerce will alert us when we reach a low stock level.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.020
Price, and then we also see the categories and

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.570
the tags which we added in the previous videos.

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.395
We can click on this star and this is for a feature product.

00:00:55.395 --> 00:00:58.500
A featured product will appear in a special location on

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.445
our site which has a dedicated area on the front page,

00:01:02.445 --> 00:01:04.980
and we'll take a look at this in just a bit.

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:06.720
Also the published date.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.930
We're interested in adding our own products.

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.620
This is laid out in a similar way to a blog post or a page,

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.845
we'll just click on "Add New" and then we can add our first new product.

00:01:17.845 --> 00:01:24.540
I'm going to do stick with the theme of the t-shirts and call this a Ninja T-Shirt,

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:31.800
and some information: short sleeve and in the color of gray,

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.845
inside the brackets we'll say this is the small version.

00:01:34.845 --> 00:01:36.540
We can add a description,

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.440
and this will show up alongside the product in the full product view.

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.630
You can create any description which you want.

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.010
I'm going to say,"Bring out the ninja in you with this awesome ninja t-shirt in gray.

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:54.135
This short sleeve shirt is ideal for summer,

00:01:54.135 --> 00:01:57.850
manufactured in a cool, light weight material."

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:08.700
Scrolling down, we have all of our product data section just here.

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.600
First of all we have the product type which is a simple product.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.375
This is just a single version of a product,

00:02:15.375 --> 00:02:16.830
so a small t-shirt,

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.900
we could have a medium t-shirt,

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.555
and these are all separate stand-alone products.

00:02:21.555 --> 00:02:24.990
In the next video, we'll take a look at how we can automatically create

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.650
different versions of the same shirt using a variable product.

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.210
This is a physical product,

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.475
so it's not downloadable or virtual,

00:02:32.475 --> 00:02:35.160
so we're going to uncheck these as well.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.025
A price, let's go for $19.95,

00:02:39.025 --> 00:02:43.505
and WooCommerce also gives us the option to add a sale price if we want to,

00:02:43.505 --> 00:02:46.090
and schedule this for a future date.

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.300
Next inventory, like we mentioned before,

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.280
this will allow us to update

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.615
our stock levels and also to be alerted when we reach a low stock level.

00:02:54.615 --> 00:02:58.980
If you want this, you can keep this checked and we can set the current stock quantity.

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.620
We can allow backorders which is a way for the customer to

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.785
order a product if we don't currently have any in stock,

00:03:04.785 --> 00:03:06.720
then when we get our stock in,

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.745
we can then ship it to the customer.

00:03:08.745 --> 00:03:12.180
Then also the low stock threshold which is the number when

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.555
WooCommerce will notify us if it reaches this value,

00:03:15.555 --> 00:03:18.150
so let's add 10 different products inside here.

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.720
We won't allow backorders and we'll keep this as two.

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.490
If you want to, you can also restrict this to only sell one quantity at a time.

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:28.410
Something else which is required is

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.505
a SKU and this is a product code or a stock keeping unit.

00:03:32.505 --> 00:03:35.175
This is a unique value for these products,

00:03:35.175 --> 00:03:37.950
you can give this a random number or a random code.

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.260
Let's have one say t-shirt,

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.905
gray, and the size of small,

00:03:43.905 --> 00:03:46.575
which matches our description up at the top.

00:03:46.575 --> 00:03:50.325
We could also add a short sleeve inside here too.

00:03:50.325 --> 00:03:53.880
Next we have the shipping option where we can add the weight and

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.600
dimensions and also add a shipping class if we want to.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.900
We don't have any of these shipping classes setup at the moment,

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.185
but these are available inside of the WooCommerce options.

00:04:04.185 --> 00:04:08.730
If we have multiple products we can also link this to other products on our site.

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.945
We can link this to products for upsells and also cross-sells too.

00:04:12.945 --> 00:04:15.405
Upsells is a way of offering the customer

00:04:15.405 --> 00:04:19.230
a higher value product which in turn brings in more revenue.

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:22.350
A cross-sell is when we take the current product and offer

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.520
the customer something else which they may also like to purchase too,

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.485
and these items are all displayed to the user when going through the checkout process.

00:04:31.485 --> 00:04:33.750
The attributes whatever these are,

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.835
these are what w added in a previous video.

00:04:35.835 --> 00:04:37.230
We can add the color,

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:40.335
the size, the sleeve type, and also the style.

00:04:40.335 --> 00:04:43.515
First, let's add the color.

00:04:43.515 --> 00:04:46.635
This is the drop-down which we previously mentioned,

00:04:46.635 --> 00:04:48.615
I'm going to select the gray color.

00:04:48.615 --> 00:04:52.020
If we want to, we can click on the ''Select All'' button too.

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.750
Next, we have the size,

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.730
this was a small version.

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:03.520
The sleeve type, this was a short sleeve.

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.010
Then the last option was the style,

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.265
plain, then save all attributes.

00:05:13.265 --> 00:05:15.680
In the advanced section, we can add a note to

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.330
the user which is sent after they've purchased this item.

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:23.280
This can be some additional information or some download instructions,

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:26.790
but generally something very specific to this item.

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:32.790
We can sell our product in a certain order and we can also enable or disable reviews too.

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:35.940
At the bottom we'll have a short version of the description,

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:39.030
and this will appear just underneath the product title.

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:43.410
So let's copy the short version from our full description,

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:48.720
paste this in, and this is all of our product detail now in place.

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:53.745
Over on the right, we have a lot of similar options from the blog posts on the pages.

00:05:53.745 --> 00:05:56.325
We can set where we want this item to be published,

00:05:56.325 --> 00:06:00.615
whether we want this to be immediately or in a set date in the future.

00:06:00.615 --> 00:06:05.055
The categories, this is of course a t-shirt.

00:06:05.055 --> 00:06:09.810
We could also add some additional tags and also select from the most used too.

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:13.110
In product image, you could upload a custom image

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:16.320
for this or select one of the existing ones from here.

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:19.995
This product was gray, so I'm going to select the gray T-shirt,

00:06:19.995 --> 00:06:26.295
the alt text for this product image.

00:06:26.295 --> 00:06:29.910
We can also add a gallery of different images if we want to.

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:32.070
I think this is all the information we need.

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:36.105
Let's click on publish and check this out over in our site.

00:06:36.105 --> 00:06:40.500
Refresh, make sure you're on the shop link just here.

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:43.755
Scroll down and there's our custom product.

00:06:43.755 --> 00:06:45.780
We can click on this to be taken through to

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:49.365
the additional information of the title, the price.

00:06:49.365 --> 00:06:52.515
This one here is our short description which we added at the bottom.

00:06:52.515 --> 00:06:53.970
We enabled stock control,

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:56.085
so we see the number of items in stock.

00:06:56.085 --> 00:06:58.320
We can add this to our cart and there's

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:01.245
all the additional information such as our product code,

00:07:01.245 --> 00:07:04.770
our categories, and the full description at the bottom.

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:07.020
This is all looking good.

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:12.570
Now go into the dashboard and into the product since this is a shirt

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:17.910
so I'm going to remove all of the sample products which are not a t-shirt so the hats,

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:19.800
the caps, the sunglasses.

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:25.890
We can remove the hoodies and just remove any of these products which you don't want,

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:28.050
your beanie, your belt.

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:31.900
We can delete all of these with the bulk actions.

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:34.980
Just before we round off this video,

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:36.690
let's add one more product.

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:39.705
We are going to create a medium version of this same product.

00:07:39.705 --> 00:07:42.960
We could start over again from the ''Add New'' button,

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:48.270
or we can use all of these options as a starting point by duplicating this product.

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:51.645
I'll remove the copy, and for this,

00:07:51.645 --> 00:07:55.245
all we need to do is to adjust this to be the medium version.

00:07:55.245 --> 00:07:59.805
The description is fine, the price is fine.

00:07:59.805 --> 00:08:03.345
Let's change this to be eight. The stock keeping unit

00:08:03.345 --> 00:08:06.315
also needs to be changed to be the medium.

00:08:06.315 --> 00:08:09.045
Remove the one since this was a duplicate,

00:08:09.045 --> 00:08:12.285
and then into the link products we can also cross-sell this.

00:08:12.285 --> 00:08:15.900
We'll also display the small version to the customer too.

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:24.010
Everything else should be fine so let's publish this over to your old store.

00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:27.345
There's also our medium version,

00:08:27.345 --> 00:08:30.795
and we are left with just the T-Shirts inside of our shop.

00:08:30.795 --> 00:08:34.665
Good, so this is how we can add a single product to our store.

00:08:34.665 --> 00:08:37.990
Next we're going to take a look at variable products.
