00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.810
We already know how we can create pages from

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.870
the dashboard with this Add New link just here.

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.460
We've also looked at how to use

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.305
the Gutenberg text editor to add lots of different content blocks to our pages.

00:00:16.305 --> 00:00:20.115
In this video, I'm going to show you a different way to create some pages.

00:00:20.115 --> 00:00:23.535
This is by using a plugin called Page Builder.

00:00:23.535 --> 00:00:25.770
Lets go back over to the dashboard and we can take

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.140
a look at how we can add this to our site.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.530
First of all, this is a plugin so Add New.

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:38.445
Then, I need to search for a Page Builder, that is filtered down.

00:00:38.445 --> 00:00:43.590
This is the one we need, which is Page Builder by SiteOrigin, install it,

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.030
and this is going to allow us to create some flexible layouts,

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.950
we can say how many rows and how wide each one of these sections is going to be.

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.870
Then we can place in a different piece of content such as widgets,

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:01.415
activate this, and as well as the standard widgets which come with WordPress.

00:01:01.415 --> 00:01:06.605
Page Builder also gives us some extra widgets too which we can also download.

00:01:06.605 --> 00:01:09.840
This, back to Add New,

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.680
do a search for site origin widgets bundle.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.320
This is what we need here. Install this.

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.140
Since these are by the same author,

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.400
you expect these widgets to be fully compatible with this Page Builder.

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.800
Activate this. There we go.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.985
If we go into the appearance and also the widgets area,

00:01:40.985 --> 00:01:45.010
inside here, we now have access to some new SiteOrigin Widgets.

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:47.720
It includes things like buttons, image carousels,

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.670
Google Maps, image widgets,

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.665
and also a text editor.

00:01:51.665 --> 00:01:56.150
As an example, let's create a new page with pages and add new.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.640
This one is for a Contact Us page.

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:05.430
Since this plugin is now installed alongside the visual and the text editor,

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.485
we also have access to a new tab called Page Builder.

00:02:08.485 --> 00:02:11.225
To get started, we can click on the "Widgets",

00:02:11.225 --> 00:02:12.530
we can add new rows,

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.490
or use some of pre-built layouts if we want to.

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.410
We're going to pull these over on the left.

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.000
Next, I'm going to start this with a new row.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.230
You'll see a preview of all changes.

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.995
We also have this Live Editor button heading to here.

00:02:25.995 --> 00:02:28.140
First, let's add our new row,

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.460
I'm going to add this with this button just here and this will give us

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:35.540
the chance to rearrange the width of each one of our sections.

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.620
We can make one side small or larger by clicking on this button in

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.335
the center and also increase or decrease the number of columns too.

00:02:44.335 --> 00:02:46.345
Lets keep this as two,

00:02:46.345 --> 00:02:48.425
which is going to be evenly spaced.

00:02:48.425 --> 00:02:51.525
If you want to fine tune things such as the CSS,

00:02:51.525 --> 00:02:55.265
we can also give each one of these rows some customer information,

00:02:55.265 --> 00:02:57.950
such as a custom ID or a custom class,

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:03.400
or we could also directly add CSS declarations into here if we wanted to.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.945
We can also fine tune the padding on the margin too.

00:03:06.945 --> 00:03:09.080
If you're not sure what margin and padding is,

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.970
the margin is the space which we can add outside of this row.

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.160
A padding is the space which appears inside of the row.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.280
We can customize all of these values on each one of the sides.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.650
If we wanted to, we could also customize a different value for

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:28.450
the mobile layout and also customize the background color and the image too.

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.250
I'm happy with these defaults so I'm going to insert this.

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.135
Then on the left side,

00:03:34.135 --> 00:03:38.250
we can add some new widgets with this button just here.

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:43.570
We can add any of the existing WordPress widgets or these ones with the blue icons,

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:47.315
the ones which should be added with the SiteOrigin Widgets Bundle.

00:03:47.315 --> 00:03:50.770
First over on the left, we can add a text block which

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:54.340
is some information about our address. Edit this.

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.620
The title is for our address so we'll say,

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.570
'you can find us at', then a colon.

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:04.915
Then just some sample address lines inside of here.

00:04:04.915 --> 00:04:11.310
Duplicate this. Line number 2, line number 3.

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.980
You can also change this to be a list if you want to you by highlighting and

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:19.425
clicking on this button just here. Insert this.

00:04:19.425 --> 00:04:21.650
We see a preview just here,

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.410
and underneath a second text widgets.

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:29.685
This one is going to contain the email and also the URL to our website.

00:04:29.685 --> 00:04:35.080
Edit this a title of useful contacts,

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:43.630
email address, and also a URL too.

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.520
Then over on the right we can add a different widget,

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.105
highlight this area into the widgets.

00:04:55.105 --> 00:04:58.105
Over on the right, it may be useful to add something such as

00:04:58.105 --> 00:05:01.540
a Google map with the location of our store.

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.070
We can go ahead and add this if we want to,

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:09.295
but something which you now need with Google Maps is access to an API key.

00:05:09.295 --> 00:05:11.220
Google maps is free to use,

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.525
but you do need to add a credit card on file.

00:05:13.525 --> 00:05:16.255
I'm not going to go through this for this project.

00:05:16.255 --> 00:05:18.520
It may be just something which maybe you may want to add in

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:21.320
the future if you go live with your store.

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.835
You can use this link at the top to be taken to the Google dashboard,

00:05:24.835 --> 00:05:28.540
you can create an API code if you want to use this in a project.

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:32.000
I'm just going to leave this off, but it can be useful to add a map onto

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.770
the contact page if you have a site which is going live.

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:39.365
Have a play around with these, you can look through all of the available widgets.

00:05:39.365 --> 00:05:42.275
You can go ahead and create a lot more new pages.

00:05:42.275 --> 00:05:44.930
Also see if this is your preferred option for creating

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:48.805
pages or if you prefer the original Gutenberg editor.

00:05:48.805 --> 00:05:50.670
Finally, let's save this,

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:54.660
click on this permalink, and that's our new Contact Us page.

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:58.520
Next we're going to also add this Contact Us page to our menu.

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.130
Also look at how we can rearrange menus too.
