00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.755
In the previous video, we added lots of sample content,

00:00:07.755 --> 00:00:12.315
and in particular, we now see lots of blog posts on our homepage.

00:00:12.315 --> 00:00:15.720
In this video, we're going to add our own blog post

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.770
and also take a look at how we can edit existing ones too.

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.760
As ever, the way to do this is to head over to the dashboard.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.405
Then we go to this Posts section just here.

00:00:27.405 --> 00:00:29.900
The layout today is similar to the pages,

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.995
one which we looked at in the last video.

00:00:31.995 --> 00:00:35.295
We can go over this and we click on all of our posts.

00:00:35.295 --> 00:00:41.250
We can directly add a new one and we can also skip to any categories and tags too.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.540
Let's go into the All Posts and we can see all of the ones

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.095
which have been created with our sample data.

00:00:48.095 --> 00:00:49.910
We also have this Hello world!

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.370
one which we set up when we first setup our Wordpress installation.

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.750
We can see the author of any of these,

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.620
this Theme Buster one and the Theme Reviewer is sample data.

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.350
With any blog post which we add ourselves,

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.110
we'll have our current logged in author.

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.660
We can see which categories this has been assigned

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.595
to and also any tags which have been added to.

00:01:12.595 --> 00:01:16.520
After this, we can see the comments which are being created.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:22.000
This particular one has a single comment which has been assigned to this blog post.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.420
If you wanted to, we could click on this.

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.140
You will be taken directly to these comments,

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:28.400
where we can approve this,

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.680
we can reply, we can edit it,

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.585
and we can also remove any inappropriate comments too.

00:01:34.585 --> 00:01:38.735
Click on the back button to be taken back to All Posts.

00:01:38.735 --> 00:01:42.035
The last section is the date which this was published.

00:01:42.035 --> 00:01:43.580
When we create a new blog post,

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.815
we can either publish this immediately or we can schedule these for a future time.

00:01:48.815 --> 00:01:51.020
If you hover over any of these blog posts,

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.220
we can also edit them.

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:53.810
We can also remove them.

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:59.200
For now, let's click on the "Add New" button at the top and create our own blog post.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.140
When adding a new blog post,

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.720
this is also going to take advantage of the block-based Gutenberg editor,

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.460
just like we looked at when we created our pages in the previous project.

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.730
At the top, we add a blog post title.

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.835
I just want to go for My First Post.

00:02:16.835 --> 00:02:21.124
Then below this, we can add various blocks of contents such as images,

00:02:21.124 --> 00:02:22.970
text, and anything else,

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.745
which we've seen in the previous videos.

00:02:25.745 --> 00:02:29.210
I'm just going to add some sample text and the way I'm going to do

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:33.485
this is by doing a search for lorem ipsum.

00:02:33.485 --> 00:02:36.710
This will take us to lipsum.com,

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:40.985
which is just a simple site for generating some sample data.

00:02:40.985 --> 00:02:44.120
What we need to do is to scroll down and

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.275
we can generate a certain number of paragraphs of words,

00:02:47.275 --> 00:02:50.895
five paragraphs is fine, click on "Generate".

00:02:50.895 --> 00:02:53.645
Then this will give us our five paragraphs,

00:02:53.645 --> 00:03:01.450
which we can now copy and paste into our project, paste this in.

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.565
We now have five paragraphs of data.

00:03:04.565 --> 00:03:09.715
We can hover over any of these sections and also see a menu pop-up.

00:03:09.715 --> 00:03:12.720
We can do things like rearranging the order.

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.335
We can make the text bold, italic.

00:03:15.335 --> 00:03:17.900
We can create links by selecting any parts of

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.625
this text and then a URL which you want to link to.

00:03:21.625 --> 00:03:24.600
We can also set things like the alignment.

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:29.500
We also have various options with this drop-down over on the right.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.650
Also with this selected text,

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.025
we have five options over in the sidebar.

00:03:34.025 --> 00:03:36.590
We can change the default font size.

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.945
We can change the color settings.

00:03:38.945 --> 00:03:41.690
If you want the very first letter to be larger,

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.810
we can also select this too,

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.730
and if we click on the Post button at the very top,

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.270
this will now give you some general settings for our blog post.

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:53.000
First of all, we have the visibility and we can select

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.865
this to be public so anybody can read our post.

00:03:55.865 --> 00:03:59.725
We can make this only available to site admins and editors.

00:03:59.725 --> 00:04:03.320
This is all based on the particular roles which we give the users.

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.740
We'll have a dedicated video on this very soon.

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:08.630
If we have some sensitive information,

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:12.295
we can also password protect our blog post too.

00:04:12.295 --> 00:04:15.515
We then have the date, we can publish this immediately,

00:04:15.515 --> 00:04:18.800
or we can schedule this for any future date.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:22.925
Then a lot of these similar options which we have seen in the previous videos,

00:04:22.925 --> 00:04:24.985
where we created at different pages.

00:04:24.985 --> 00:04:26.300
We have the permalink,

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.715
which is a direct link to this post.

00:04:28.715 --> 00:04:31.975
We can assign the various categories or tags.

00:04:31.975 --> 00:04:38.820
We can either select any existing categories or add a new one too. Same for the tags.

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.420
We have a featured image which you can also add.

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:44.515
This is a image which will appear next to our blog post,

00:04:44.515 --> 00:04:46.535
any blog page list in.

00:04:46.535 --> 00:04:52.580
The excerpt, this is a preview or a shortened version of our blog post.

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.810
This is what we see if we go to the front end of our site.

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:59.045
This is all of the shortened versions which you see here.

00:04:59.045 --> 00:05:01.490
Since we don't want to show the full blog post on this

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.960
listing because this page will be really, really long.

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.910
If we don't add any excerpt into here,

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:12.925
WordPress will automatically take the first sections of our blog post.

00:05:12.925 --> 00:05:17.720
After this, we can also set if discussions or comments are allowed for this post.

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:21.530
This particular theme also allows us to select a different layout.

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:24.350
We can add sidebars to the left and right.

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:27.805
We can remove the sidebar and have a full-size content.

00:05:27.805 --> 00:05:30.480
I'm just going to leave this as the default.

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:34.515
Up to the top, let's publish this so we can see this on our site.

00:05:34.515 --> 00:05:39.435
Confirm. Over to the front end and refresh the browser.

00:05:39.435 --> 00:05:42.655
You see My First Post is now appearing.

00:05:42.655 --> 00:05:45.905
Since this one is the most recent blog post,

00:05:45.905 --> 00:05:49.115
you may expect this to appear right at the very top,

00:05:49.115 --> 00:05:51.560
and this will often be the case, but however,

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.915
when importing all the sample data,

00:05:53.915 --> 00:05:57.085
one of these posts has been set to be sticky.

00:05:57.085 --> 00:05:59.150
If we click into this,

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:05.030
we then take into the full version of our post and go to "Edit Post".

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:07.100
Then over in the settings on the right,

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.555
we can see that this has been stuck to the top of the page.

00:06:10.555 --> 00:06:12.780
We can uncheck this,

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:17.740
update our post, and back over to our site.

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:22.820
This now leads our first blog post right at the very top.

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:26.810
Into here we can see our custom editor and we can see the different colors.

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:30.320
We can see the larger first letter and also we can

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:34.295
do pretty much anything we wanted to with all of our content blocks.

00:06:34.295 --> 00:06:37.525
Also, if our post is becoming really long,

00:06:37.525 --> 00:06:40.415
we can also insert a page break.

00:06:40.415 --> 00:06:43.160
Click on the Plus icon.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.955
Search for the page break.

00:06:45.955 --> 00:06:50.275
This will now split up our content into two pages.

00:06:50.275 --> 00:06:53.585
We can add as many of these page breaks as we would like.

00:06:53.585 --> 00:06:57.515
I'm just going to keep that one for now. Update this post.

00:06:57.515 --> 00:07:00.595
Now if we refresh our site,

00:07:00.595 --> 00:07:04.505
we see the bottom half of our content has now been removed.

00:07:04.505 --> 00:07:07.790
We can also switch between our pages at the bottom.

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:12.605
This is how we can add new blog post and also edit existing posts.

00:07:12.605 --> 00:07:16.070
If you want to, you can go ahead and add as many different posts as you would

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:19.940
like or even update any of the existing ones too.

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:22.250
One way of really bringing our blog post to

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:25.945
life is by adding different media such as images.

00:07:25.945 --> 00:07:30.480
This is what we're now going to move onto in the upcoming videos.
