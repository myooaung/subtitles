00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:06.610
For this section, we're going to be building a brand new project.

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:09.280
As you can see, this is a web development blog,

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.040
and this will teach us some different techniques.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.215
We use some different options from the previous sections.

00:00:15.215 --> 00:00:18.105
We're going to be using a completely different theme.

00:00:18.105 --> 00:00:20.290
We'll be making use of lots of different widgets,

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:22.570
we'll be adding a sliding carousel,

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.330
just like we see here, and this will link to different pages.

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:30.205
These pages are also available from different sections below.

00:00:30.205 --> 00:00:32.020
We have some widget areas.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.105
We're going to be constructing this page using

00:00:34.105 --> 00:00:36.800
some template which should be provided with this theme.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.095
We have some featured areas which will focus on certain sections of our site,

00:00:41.095 --> 00:00:43.475
and these will all link to different pages.

00:00:43.475 --> 00:00:45.870
We have some banners, we have some testimonials,

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.190
we have some case studies,

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.155
we have a focus area on a particular section.

00:00:50.155 --> 00:00:52.850
Then we've got a footer down at the very bottom.

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.900
This footer will also link to all pages,

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.470
we have a calendar which will link to previous blog posts,

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:00.700
we'll integrate social media icons,

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.490
and also link to recent comments too.

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:07.840
The social media icons will also be placed in different locations.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.930
We can see them hovering over the top right of our site,

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.920
and these are fully functional.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.619
We'll look at how to move our blog posts on to different pages,

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.455
we'll look at how to change the layout and style in,

00:01:19.455 --> 00:01:23.835
and make heavy use of the customizer to change the look and feel of our site.

00:01:23.835 --> 00:01:25.620
For any one of these blog posts,

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.110
we'll also be able to click through to

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.580
the full version where we'll also see a sidebar over on the right,

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.550
and we can also leave comments for each user.

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.490
As well as this, we're going to have different pages such as the About Us,

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.355
which we can click on and be taken through to this page.

00:01:40.355 --> 00:01:43.250
We'll also have a Contact Us page too.

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.020
This is a fully functional Contact Us form,

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.200
and we'll also take a look at how to customize

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.535
this and also add and remove different fields.

00:01:51.535 --> 00:01:55.790
This project is heavily based around adding and updating blog posts,

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.200
how to include media to make our post look really good.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.780
We'll also take a focus on how we can work with different users,

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:08.195
different permission levels, and also what kind of access each user has to our site.

00:02:08.195 --> 00:02:10.444
We'll work with navigation menus,

00:02:10.444 --> 00:02:12.649
the customizer page templates,

00:02:12.649 --> 00:02:15.200
adding a slider, working with plugins,

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.690
and so much more.

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.730
By the end of this project, you'll have a really good idea of how to

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.630
customize your site even when using a pre-existing theme.

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.020
To round things off,

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.350
we'll also take a look at how we can improve our site search engine optimization,

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.925
and also how to perform regular backups,

00:02:31.925 --> 00:02:34.865
make sure we don't lose all of our valuable data.

00:02:34.865 --> 00:02:37.255
I hope you are excited about this project,

00:02:37.255 --> 00:02:41.970
and we'll begin in the next video by setting up this project.
