00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:04.770
Welcome back. The last thing you want to do is spend

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.445
lots and lots of time on writing great blog posts.

00:00:08.445 --> 00:00:13.575
If you can't find any great images or media to go with it.

00:00:13.575 --> 00:00:16.530
This video is all about showing you a couple of

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:20.655
resources which can help you find some high-quality images.

00:00:20.655 --> 00:00:24.885
Also, illustrations, vector graphics, and videos.

00:00:24.885 --> 00:00:29.325
These can all be included in your websites or your blog posts.

00:00:29.325 --> 00:00:33.315
The first resource is a website called Pixabay,

00:00:33.315 --> 00:00:35.835
and that's our pixabay.com.

00:00:35.835 --> 00:00:38.865
It's got thousands of free stock photos,

00:00:38.865 --> 00:00:41.645
vectors, and also videos.

00:00:41.645 --> 00:00:45.445
We can have a search using the search box at the top there,

00:00:45.445 --> 00:00:47.345
or if you scroll down a little further,

00:00:47.345 --> 00:00:50.390
there's tabs, wait, illustrations,

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.055
vector graphics, and also videos.

00:00:54.055 --> 00:00:58.365
One of the great things about Pixabay is as you can see,

00:00:58.365 --> 00:01:04.835
all videos and images are released free of copyrights under the Creative Commons.

00:01:04.835 --> 00:01:09.740
That basically means that you are free to download, free to change,

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.660
free to distribute the images,

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.370
and you don't need to pay any royalties to

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:17.840
the office and also attribution is not required.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.500
That basically means that sometimes stock photography

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.160
is free to download and free to use but sometimes you need to

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.915
provide a link back to the website which you downloaded it from or

00:01:29.915 --> 00:01:35.740
a link to the offer in return for the image to be provided free of charge.

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.280
But that's not required on Pixabay.

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.825
If you want to find out a little bit more about the usage rights,

00:01:41.825 --> 00:01:43.970
just click on the "Learn More" button,

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.335
and there's a list of frequently asked questions.

00:01:47.335 --> 00:01:51.420
Once you're on the website and you find a image which you like,

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.885
just simply click on the image and you can download the image in various sizes.

00:01:56.885 --> 00:02:01.070
You do need to be logged in to download the larger versions,

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.875
but the images are still free to download.

00:02:03.875 --> 00:02:08.960
There's also a confirmation that the image is free for commercial use.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:14.795
There's also no attribution required to Pixabay or to the author.

00:02:14.795 --> 00:02:21.215
Then the next website I'm going to look at is a website called Unsplash.com.

00:02:21.215 --> 00:02:26.945
Unsplash.com is also a free resource for stock photos.

00:02:26.945 --> 00:02:30.575
If you click on the "do whatever you want" link,

00:02:30.575 --> 00:02:34.405
you can get some more information about the license.

00:02:34.405 --> 00:02:37.760
Just like on Pixabay, all photos published on

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.285
Unsplash are licensed under the Creative Commons Zero.

00:02:41.285 --> 00:02:44.389
We can copy, modify, distribute,

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:46.175
and use the photos for free,

00:02:46.175 --> 00:02:48.770
and that also includes commercial use.

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:53.645
We also don't need permission from the photographer or from Unsplash.

00:02:53.645 --> 00:02:58.120
We also don't need to provide attribution if we don't want to.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.645
Just go back to the homepage.

00:03:00.645 --> 00:03:03.495
It's really simple to search for photos,

00:03:03.495 --> 00:03:08.875
and also we can browse by what's new and also various collections.

00:03:08.875 --> 00:03:15.625
There's also a option to subscribe and get 10 new photos every 10 days.

00:03:15.625 --> 00:03:20.180
The next resource is a company called Shutterstock.

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.465
This is available from Shutterstock.com.

00:03:23.465 --> 00:03:26.290
These are probably the largest of them all.

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:31.520
There's a image, a video clip of pretty much anything you can imagine.

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.130
However, the website is not free to use.

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.535
There's various different pricing plans which you can pick,

00:03:37.535 --> 00:03:40.700
but you can find almost anything you're looking for.

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.590
Let's look for tigers.

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.990
It take me to the search which has lots of pictures of tigers,

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:53.210
both taken by photographers,

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:57.335
and also images taken by illustrators.

00:03:57.335 --> 00:04:00.710
If you scroll down to the bottom, you can see that the search alone

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:04.745
has 1,147 different pages.

00:04:04.745 --> 00:04:11.750
Also, this week alone has been 924,000 new stock images just added this week.

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.930
That gives you an idea of the size of Shutterstock.

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:22.200
The next resource which is also free to use is the Wikimedia Commons website.

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:26.330
This is a database of 31 million freely

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:30.910
reusable media files which anyone can contribute to.

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:32.990
These are arranged into images,

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.065
sounds, and also videos.

00:04:35.065 --> 00:04:39.500
These are all licensed under the Creative Commons.

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.050
Again, these are all free to download.

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.125
But just do check each individual image.

00:04:45.125 --> 00:04:49.915
Just check the licensing agreements and also if there's any attribution required.

00:04:49.915 --> 00:04:53.830
Lastly, if you just wants to do a Google search.

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:57.105
Let's look for the tigers again,

00:04:57.105 --> 00:04:59.980
and then go to images.

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:04.320
A useful tool we can use is the Search Tools.

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:09.125
We click on "Search Tools" and then "Usage Rights".

00:05:09.125 --> 00:05:13.920
We can then filter down the images by the license type.

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:19.660
I'm just going to search for tigers labeled for reuse with modification.

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:22.955
Then these are filtered down to the ones we can modify.

00:05:22.955 --> 00:05:27.050
But again, do click on the individual image and go to the website.

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:29.690
Just double-check that the image is free to

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:33.700
download and whether or not any attribution is required.

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:38.599
Of course, you can find many more free and paid stock photography websites

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:40.760
with a quick Google search,

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:44.190
but these are some great sites to get you started.
