00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:08.535
Welcome back. So now we know how WordPress deals weighed page templates.

00:00:08.535 --> 00:00:12.270
We know how WordPress split things up into various sections,

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:15.135
such as the header and the footer.

00:00:15.135 --> 00:00:19.905
In this video we're going to get to work by creating the header and the footer section,

00:00:19.905 --> 00:00:25.034
and then convert the parts that we need from all static site into WordPress,

00:00:25.034 --> 00:00:27.990
and then include knees into our theme.

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.575
On the desktop I've got a copy of the static website,

00:00:31.575 --> 00:00:34.210
which is being supplied with this course.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.265
Now I'm going to open up my text editor.

00:00:37.265 --> 00:00:39.290
I'm going to open up the brackets,

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.660
and the first thing I want to do a is drug

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:47.425
into WordPress theme folder from inside the htdocs.

00:00:47.425 --> 00:00:52.270
Drag the pro headphones folder in to that.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.775
Then I'm also going to drag over

00:00:58.775 --> 00:01:04.530
the static website and then just leaves on folder when we need it.

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.000
I'm going to go back to the WordPress theme,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.955
and then we're going to start in the header.PHP section.

00:01:12.955 --> 00:01:16.085
If we look down all the files and folders,

00:01:16.085 --> 00:01:19.615
we should see the wp-content.

00:01:19.615 --> 00:01:22.790
In fact, we'll make this a little bit easier for ourselves.

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:24.890
Go to pro headphones,

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:30.840
content, themes, and we'll actually just drugging the theme folder.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.560
I should make it a little bit easier.

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.925
Go into the header.PHP file.

00:01:38.925 --> 00:01:42.485
As you can see, this is the header for our theme.

00:01:42.485 --> 00:01:47.135
On this section includes all the area in the header section,

00:01:47.135 --> 00:01:50.430
all the way down to the opening content tag.

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.315
A lot of this will look familiar if you use to build in normal HTML websites.

00:01:56.315 --> 00:01:58.925
We've got the usual HTML tags,

00:01:58.925 --> 00:02:05.020
the head section, various meta tags, the viewport tag.

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.855
Then a little bit further down we've got the closest head section,

00:02:08.855 --> 00:02:11.395
and then the body section.

00:02:11.395 --> 00:02:16.370
I'm going to go down a little bit further and find the header section.

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.310
Look for the opening header section,

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:25.550
and then look for the closing at a section which is the masthead area.

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.225
I'm just going to actually delete this header section,

00:02:29.225 --> 00:02:33.520
and then we can replace it with our own header section.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.675
Go over to the static template on the HTML version,

00:02:38.675 --> 00:02:42.450
and then we'll go into the index.html.

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.470
Then to replace the delete section,

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.695
go down to our header section.

00:02:47.695 --> 00:02:53.510
I'm going to copy all head action all the way down.

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.610
Actually we'll keep going to the feature section,

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.925
because the headphones images is always at the top of the website.

00:03:01.925 --> 00:03:04.825
I'm going to also include this in the header.

00:03:04.825 --> 00:03:07.975
I'm just going to copy that section,

00:03:07.975 --> 00:03:11.525
and then go back over to our theme folder.

00:03:11.525 --> 00:03:14.180
In the header section that we just deleted,

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:20.070
just paste this new in to that. Let's save that.

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:25.320
Now if we go over to the web browser and then refresh.

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.055
We can see we've got a change.

00:03:29.055 --> 00:03:30.785
The new header section,

00:03:30.785 --> 00:03:35.075
it doesn't look much other mineable we've actually got some of the content appearance.

00:03:35.075 --> 00:03:38.270
There's the link for our logo,

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:40.870
we've got the menu items.

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.905
We've got a search bar,

00:03:42.905 --> 00:03:45.470
and also headphones image.

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:50.555
If you open up the HTML version,

00:03:50.555 --> 00:03:55.490
so index.html, you can see that this is the areas that we've copied,

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:57.680
the navigation, the search,

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.390
and also the large image.

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.930
It's installed at the minute, but the main thing is that

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.870
it's all linked and it's all working.

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:13.130
Now let's get to work with replacing the photo section.

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:18.050
Save the header.PHP, and then if we go into

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:24.760
the sidebar and look for the footer.PHP and scroll down.

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.630
We need to basically do the same thing that we don't have the header.

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.275
Delete the existing food section,

00:04:33.275 --> 00:04:40.060
and then go over to our template on the desktop into the index page,

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.205
and scroll down right to the variable on,

00:04:43.205 --> 00:04:46.485
and then look for the footer section.

00:04:46.485 --> 00:04:52.110
Copy this all the way back up to the opening footer tag,

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.040
and then back over to our theme.

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:02.190
I make sure this is pasted in the same area that we just deleted.

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:07.465
Save, and then now when we refresh our website,

00:05:07.465 --> 00:05:11.630
again is a change the area that we just added, the contractors,

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:13.205
the about us section,

00:05:13.205 --> 00:05:18.035
the address on also the text of the bottom is all appearing.

00:05:18.035 --> 00:05:24.960
You can see it's the same information that's included at the bottom of our HTML version.

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.755
That's how we can add the header and the footer section.

00:05:29.755 --> 00:05:32.135
Just one more thing before we move on,

00:05:32.135 --> 00:05:35.540
I just want to show you the index.PHP page.

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:40.535
You can see at the top of the page there's a function called get header.

00:05:40.535 --> 00:05:43.620
This is pulling in the header section,

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.765
and then scroll further down.

00:05:47.765 --> 00:05:50.180
We've got a get photo function.

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:53.500
This is pulling the contents of the footer.

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:57.200
Rather than having all these areas placed in one file,

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:00.440
we've got them all segregated into the own sections,

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:04.380
and then we're just pulling them in with the various functions.

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:06.470
It also gets sidebar,

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:08.790
which will work with later too.

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:11.745
I'm just going to leave this video there,

00:06:11.745 --> 00:06:14.870
and we'll come back in the next video and we'll start working with

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:19.310
the CSS to make the website look more like our HTML version.

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:22.100
I will also add in the images such as

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:27.270
the headphones images to make them available for the new WordPress theme.
