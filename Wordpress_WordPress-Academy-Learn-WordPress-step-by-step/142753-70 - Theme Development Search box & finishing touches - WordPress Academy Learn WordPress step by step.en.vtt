00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:06.570
In this video, we're going to add some final touches to our website,

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:12.660
as well as making the search box in the header section function correctly.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.600
So currently if we type anything inside the search box, nothing works.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.110
This is because it's just plain HTML.

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:27.030
So in this video, we're going to replace this search with a WordPress function.

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:33.700
So let's go over to Google and search for WordPress,

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:42.390
the search query, and let's go to the Codex.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.635
Let's scroll down and take a look at the examples.

00:00:47.635 --> 00:00:52.105
So this example shows the search query in a search box.

00:00:52.105 --> 00:00:55.340
So I'm going to copy the example,

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.980
and then go over to the header,

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.835
and then once in the header.php,

00:01:01.835 --> 00:01:06.710
we need to scroll down and find the section with the search box in.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.750
Look for the div with the class of top bar right,

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.365
and then within the unordered list,

00:01:12.365 --> 00:01:16.485
pasting the function of the WordPress search,

00:01:16.485 --> 00:01:20.630
let's get rid of the side buffer now to give it more space.

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:26.170
So let's head over to the site and then refresh.

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.005
So now we've got two search boxes.

00:01:29.005 --> 00:01:31.675
One is the WordPress generated one,

00:01:31.675 --> 00:01:33.610
and we've got our own search box.

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.235
Now, we need to make sure that the WordPress

00:01:36.235 --> 00:01:40.015
generated version is styled in the same way as ours.

00:01:40.015 --> 00:01:42.670
So let's head over and do that now.

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.680
So the first thing you notice on

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:50.860
the opening inputs for the search is the input type is text,

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.515
whereas ours is search.

00:01:53.515 --> 00:01:56.560
So that changes too match.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.260
We've also got a placeholder value,

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.935
and this is the text which appears inside the box.

00:02:05.935 --> 00:02:09.620
So that's also on the inside there.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:14.700
The WordPress So mips one is a input,

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.080
whereas ours is a button.

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:26.920
So let's change inputs to be button as let's add this close and button tag.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:34.675
Let's copy the search text and paste that in there.

00:02:34.675 --> 00:02:38.855
We've also got the type of button rather than submit,

00:02:38.855 --> 00:02:41.605
so let's add this inside there too.

00:02:41.605 --> 00:02:44.790
We've also got the class on button,

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:52.125
so let's copy that and then paste that in too and save.

00:02:52.125 --> 00:02:54.730
Let's see how it's looking so far.

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:59.010
It's looking at a lot more like the finished version.

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:04.020
So let's now move the submit button to be on the right-hand side.

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:10.890
So our version has the inputs and the button within the list item tags,

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.480
so let's add these in too.

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:24.380
So the opening tag and a closing tag,

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:27.930
and do exactly the same for the button,

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:32.280
copy that and paste that there.

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.340
We needed that now,

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.015
so let's remove our list items from our static site,

00:03:40.015 --> 00:03:44.315
and then we need to add the unordered list with the class of menu,

00:03:44.315 --> 00:03:47.360
which was originally surrounding the two list items.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:52.120
So put that, and paste it above the first list item.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.980
In fact, we can just replace the div there,

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:02.550
and the closing div which is now the closing unordered list.

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:07.180
So let's clean all this up.

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:18.345
Make sure that you've got the form,

00:04:18.345 --> 00:04:21.145
the opening tag and the closing tag,

00:04:21.145 --> 00:04:23.450
and then nest it inside there in

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:27.905
the unordered list with the class of menu and the closing tag,

00:04:27.905 --> 00:04:29.885
the first list item,

00:04:29.885 --> 00:04:34.185
and then the second list item, and then save that.

00:04:34.185 --> 00:04:36.394
Now, when we refresh,

00:04:36.394 --> 00:04:38.750
we should get the search box to be in line,

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.985
and now it looks exactly like it did in the static version.

00:04:42.985 --> 00:04:45.930
Now let's do a search and see if it works.

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:50.265
Search for hello, and now let's go down.

00:04:50.265 --> 00:04:52.560
Says our search results for hello,

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.375
and as our HelloWorld blog post.

00:04:55.375 --> 00:04:58.470
Let's just search for more,

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:03.120
post, and then we'll go, it says our new post 3,

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.910
new post 2, number 1,

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:13.260
and of course the HelloWorld example has word post in there.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.175
Now when it's at the containers,

00:05:15.175 --> 00:05:18.100
like we did in the single blog page,

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:21.260
because when we stretch the page before width,

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:25.990
the results are not centered in the middle of the page.

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:31.720
So when it's at the containers to the search.php page,

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:35.610
so let's go over to the index.php,

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:40.450
and then we'll copy the row on the medium a div.

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:43.310
So copy these two rows,

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:46.895
and then go to the search.php,

00:05:46.895 --> 00:05:51.980
which is the page template for displaying the search results.

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:57.255
Then just exactly like we've done in the single page,

00:05:57.255 --> 00:06:00.400
paste it just blow the header,

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:06.580
and then close off the two divs just after the primary section,

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:12.320
the first one and then the second one.

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.810
Save that and then refresh.

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:19.375
Now the content is being moved inside the container.

00:06:19.375 --> 00:06:22.945
Again, just like we've done with the single.php,

00:06:22.945 --> 00:06:26.270
let's add the sidebar to the right hand side,

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:29.790
back over to the index page,

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:33.360
and then go down to the bottom,

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.750
and then copy the sidebar,

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:39.510
which is a full div with the class of medium 3,

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:46.770
then into the search page and paste these between the two divs that we've just added.

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:51.375
Because this has the get sidebar function,

00:06:51.375 --> 00:06:55.320
we can delete the get side bar from the bottom of the page,

00:06:55.320 --> 00:07:00.545
and then let's take a look at the search results, and that's all done.

00:07:00.545 --> 00:07:03.905
So now there's a sidebar on the right hand side.

00:07:03.905 --> 00:07:09.670
I will blog post or I will search results all in the correct containers.

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:14.750
Next, I'm going to move on to link in the logo to the homepage.

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:16.955
So if we click on the minutes,

00:07:16.955 --> 00:07:19.985
we're taken to a 404 page,

00:07:19.985 --> 00:07:22.475
which is a page not found.

00:07:22.475 --> 00:07:29.315
So now we need to add a WordPress function to link the logo to our homepage.

00:07:29.315 --> 00:07:34.015
This is simply done in the header.php.

00:07:34.015 --> 00:07:39.125
So if look for the list item with class of menu text.

00:07:39.125 --> 00:07:44.155
Pro headphones is a name in the top left-hand corner,

00:07:44.155 --> 00:07:48.300
so rather than link into the index.html,

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:50.645
which is a page that we no longer have.

00:07:50.645 --> 00:07:58.260
Let's remove this and then open up the php tags, php closing tag.

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:01.860
It's put on its own line so it's more readable,

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:06.150
php, and then we're going to echo,

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:09.395
and the function we need is escape URL,

00:08:09.395 --> 00:08:15.659
which is esc_url, and then the brackets,

00:08:15.659 --> 00:08:20.650
and then inside the bracket is the function we need, is home_url.

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:29.750
This will link to the website's home URL and a semicolon.

00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:33.510
Let's check that out, so refresh.

00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:38.770
Now if we click on the website's logo or title,

00:08:39.410 --> 00:08:43.480
that doesn't appear to work, and so let's see what's wrong.

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:48.010
Let's start with the cyber to get more space.

00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:52.830
That's just a typo mistake there,

00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:55.290
so the question mark inside there,

00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:59.710
let's save that, and then refresh.

00:08:59.710 --> 00:09:04.775
So if we click on the logo or the title in the corner,

00:09:04.775 --> 00:09:08.040
now we're taken back to the homepage.

00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:12.755
I'm going to add one more PHP function.

00:09:12.755 --> 00:09:15.635
Rather than having the pro headphones title,

00:09:15.635 --> 00:09:19.400
we want WordPress to build policy and dynamically.

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:22.130
So let's put this on a separate line.

00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:23.660
Open a PHP function,

00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:33.680
and the function that we want is echo get_bloginfo,

00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:40.255
and the blog info that we want is the blogs name,

00:09:40.255 --> 00:09:42.975
and don't forget the semicolon,

00:09:42.975 --> 00:09:46.945
and then save that and refresh the page.

00:09:46.945 --> 00:09:49.560
So rather than a hard-coded title,

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:51.950
this grabs the name of the site we've entered,

00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:55.140
which we can see inside the customizer,

00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:59.899
then down to the site identity.

00:09:59.899 --> 00:10:02.870
So this is the title which were pulled in.

00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:07.830
So we will just to delete that and save.

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:12.635
This will change the title,

00:10:12.635 --> 00:10:22.970
so let's just change it back, and then save that.

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:30.205
The last thing we want to look at changing is the link colors,

00:10:30.205 --> 00:10:33.850
so at the minute the link colors have all been changed to purple,

00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:36.835
which isn't fitting with the rest of the theme.

00:10:36.835 --> 00:10:40.900
So let's go into the dev tools and find the selector.

00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:43.760
So go to Inspect.

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:54.740
Then let's select the item that we want to change. Let's drag this up.

00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:58.285
So we can see in the dev tools that the links,

00:10:58.285 --> 00:11:00.115
which is a visited,

00:11:00.115 --> 00:11:02.810
has the color of purple.

00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:08.435
Let's go into our custom style sheets and make sure this is changed.

00:11:08.435 --> 00:11:13.950
So style.css, and we need to go right down to the very bomb.

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:17.405
So in our custom styling,

00:11:17.405 --> 00:11:22.980
we've already got the a tags and also the a hover states.

00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:28.380
So let's add a visited just above the hover state.

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:39.990
We'll just copy the color from the novel links and then refresh.

00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:44.350
So I get rid of the purple color.

00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:48.670
Let's check out the blog too.

00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:58.080
Good. So if all the purple links have been removed.

00:11:59.810 --> 00:12:02.655
Great. So that's the end of the section,

00:12:02.655 --> 00:12:07.580
and that's how we can convert a normal website to be a WordPress theme.

00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:09.685
So I hope you enjoyed this section.

00:12:09.685 --> 00:12:12.820
Now, let's move on with the rest of the course.
