00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.035
Welcome back guys. In this video we're going to take a look at php arrays.

00:00:05.035 --> 00:00:06.385
So in previous videos,

00:00:06.385 --> 00:00:08.010
we looked at variables,

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.190
which are great for storing data which can be changed.

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.890
However, they can only hold one value,

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:16.860
but if we wanted to store more than one value,

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:18.840
we need to use an array.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.785
We can store as many values inside of that array as we like.

00:00:22.785 --> 00:00:27.390
This is how we create an array using php.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.315
So there's two different methods I'm going to show you.

00:00:30.315 --> 00:00:34.170
The first one, we can set the array's name,

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.795
just like a variable name.

00:00:36.795 --> 00:00:40.530
I'm going to create an array of shapes,

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.725
and then set this to be an array.

00:00:43.725 --> 00:00:46.200
Then we need to follow the array key word,

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.530
with the curly brackets, and then a semicolon.

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:57.410
All we've done there is create an empty array with the name of shapes.

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.355
To add some values inside of this empty array,

00:01:01.355 --> 00:01:04.595
let's use the array's name,

00:01:04.595 --> 00:01:08.300
and then followed by a set of square brackets,

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.165
and then we need to put in the index number.

00:01:11.165 --> 00:01:16.055
We start with zero, which is the first position of an array.

00:01:16.055 --> 00:01:21.890
I'm going to set this to be the first shape, so a square.

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.040
This now adds the value of square inside the array,

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.445
and let's add one or two more,

00:01:29.445 --> 00:01:33.640
so shapes and then position one.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.200
This can be a circle,

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:49.360
and then shapes, position two, so a triangle.

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:55.145
Okay so we've set an empty array to have the name of shapes,

00:01:55.145 --> 00:02:00.070
and then we've added three values to the array of square, circle and triangle.

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.355
So to check if this is working,

00:02:02.355 --> 00:02:04.605
we can do an echo,

00:02:04.605 --> 00:02:09.395
so it's echo the array's name of shapes,

00:02:09.395 --> 00:02:16.180
and then the elements of the array that we want to print so let's start with number two.

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.255
So you should print out to the browser the value of triangle,

00:02:20.255 --> 00:02:24.335
so save that, and then refresh, and there we go.

00:02:24.335 --> 00:02:27.245
That's the position number two of the array,

00:02:27.245 --> 00:02:29.665
which has the value of triangle.

00:02:29.665 --> 00:02:32.100
Let's change this to number one,

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.920
so we should get the circle.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.900
This is quite a long way of writing an array.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.235
There is a simpler way to write an array,

00:02:42.235 --> 00:02:45.610
this is by using the literal method.

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.980
So instead of what we're doing above,

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.280
we can set the array's name of shapes,

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.400
and then we can set that to an array,

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.335
and then we can put the values straight inside the array.

00:02:59.335 --> 00:03:03.105
First of all we can put in the square,

00:03:03.105 --> 00:03:06.405
and then separate by commas,

00:03:06.405 --> 00:03:15.010
the circle, and then the triangle.

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.260
Let's just delete this one for now,

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.480
and then we can do the echo just as we've done before.

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.715
So let's echo the name,

00:03:26.715 --> 00:03:32.290
which is shapes and then in square brackets again,

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.240
we need to put in the index number,

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.085
so let's start with zero,

00:03:36.085 --> 00:03:38.365
which is the square.

00:03:38.365 --> 00:03:41.620
Save that and then refresh,

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.715
and we'll get the value of square.

00:03:43.715 --> 00:03:47.655
So either of these two methods worked perfectly fine.

00:03:47.655 --> 00:03:49.360
So a few videos ago,

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.954
we took a look at string functions,

00:03:51.954 --> 00:03:57.020
where we reversed the order of the string and then we changed the text to be uppercase.

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:59.570
Arrays also have similar functions,

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:03.265
and as a list of available functions are php.net,

00:04:03.265 --> 00:04:06.204
but I'm just going to go through one or two examples,

00:04:06.204 --> 00:04:09.215
just to show you what we can do with array functions.

00:04:09.215 --> 00:04:12.075
So the first one is the count function,

00:04:12.075 --> 00:04:15.640
which counts the number of items inside the array.

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.240
We use the count function,

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:23.545
and then we'll put the array's name inside the brackets,

00:04:23.545 --> 00:04:26.410
so we can delete that zero.

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.735
You should echo to the browser,

00:04:28.735 --> 00:04:34.120
the number of items inside the shapes array so refresh.

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.760
There's three items inside the array.

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.390
This also varies over functions such as,

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:46.880
the array pop, which removes and returns the very last item from the end of an array.

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.605
To do this, I'm going to create one more variable.

00:04:51.605 --> 00:04:54.980
I'm going to call it the lastshape.

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:58.955
So the lastshape I want to grab is a triangle.

00:04:58.955 --> 00:05:01.550
To grab the value of this,

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:08.550
I'm going to set this value to be equal to array_ pop.

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.220
Then to drop the value of triangle, or the last item,

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:18.600
we just need to put in the name of the array, which is shapes.

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:23.270
So now what we've done is we've set the last item on the array,

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:25.505
inside this variable name.

00:05:25.505 --> 00:05:29.435
Now we can just echo this variable name to the browser,

00:05:29.435 --> 00:05:32.050
and we should get the value of triangle.

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:36.885
So echo the variable name of lastshape,

00:05:36.885 --> 00:05:39.780
and then refresh, and there we go.

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.145
So that's the value of triangle.

00:05:42.145 --> 00:05:47.765
We can also find the minimum and the maximum value of an array.

00:05:47.765 --> 00:05:51.780
Let's create an array with numbers this time,

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:55.570
so numbers is equal to an array.

00:05:55.570 --> 00:06:00.210
We don't need to put any numbers inside the quotations.

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:05.610
Let's just put some numbers inside there,

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:08.355
and then we can echo.

00:06:08.355 --> 00:06:11.285
If we wanted to find out the largest number,

00:06:11.285 --> 00:06:13.985
we could use the max function,

00:06:13.985 --> 00:06:16.415
and then inside the brackets,

00:06:16.415 --> 00:06:21.100
the name of the array, which is numbers.

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:25.145
Now we should get printed to the screen, the maximum number,

00:06:25.145 --> 00:06:31.230
which is 67, which we do.

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:36.390
We can also replace max with min,

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:39.370
and we should get a value of one.

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:47.660
Okay, great. So that's how you can create an array using php,

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:51.730
and also some basic php array functions.

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:54.480
So thank you and I'll see you in the next video,

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:58.029
where we'll take a look at php functions.
