00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:06.060
Welcome everybody. This video is all about showing you how you can get

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.155
your WordPress website up and running on a live server.

00:00:10.155 --> 00:00:15.300
We're going to use a plugin to make this a really simple process and it's

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:21.255
possible to export your website from a local host to a live server in just a few minutes.

00:00:21.255 --> 00:00:23.115
So the first thing you need to do,

00:00:23.115 --> 00:00:26.355
if you want to put your website live on the Internet,

00:00:26.355 --> 00:00:28.965
is to buy some web hosting,

00:00:28.965 --> 00:00:31.170
and you'll also need a domain name.

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.640
So for this tutorial,

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.070
I'm going to be using the cPanel and also the WordPress One-Click installations,

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.890
which are available with most popular hosting providers.

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.730
So you need to log into the hosting account.

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.770
I'm going to go to manage,

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.260
and we'll take it over to the cPanel.

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.725
So depending on which is your hosting provider,

00:00:54.725 --> 00:00:57.245
you may find it looks a little bit different to this,

00:00:57.245 --> 00:01:01.780
but all you need to do is look for the WordPress One-Click installation.

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.005
So under the web applications,

00:01:04.005 --> 00:01:07.460
I want to click on WordPress and this

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.600
is going to set WordPress onto my chosen domain name.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.390
So I'll click on install this application.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.830
I'm going to save mine to the wordpressacademycourse.com.

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.955
You can also change various versions,

00:01:26.955 --> 00:01:30.799
and there's also lots of different options,

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:33.110
but I'm going to leave these as default.

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.419
I'm going to add a administrator

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:45.330
and also a password @ e-mail.

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.260
Okay. So the website title and the tagline,

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.390
I'm just going to leave these as they are for now,

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.645
because we're going to import all the data from our localhost.

00:01:58.645 --> 00:02:02.460
So we don't need to change that and then I'm going to click on

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:08.025
install and just let that do it's thing.

00:02:08.025 --> 00:02:13.500
So remember that some one-click installs are little bit different to this one,

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.090
but I'm sure we can work it out.

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.609
So just give that a few moments to install,

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.370
and I will go search the WordPress application installed.

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.520
So now, I'm going to go over to a new tab,

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.685
and type in my domain name.

00:02:35.685 --> 00:02:41.250
So wordpressacademycourse.com, and there we go.

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.565
So there's our WordPress installation,

00:02:43.565 --> 00:02:45.710
and that's the default theme.

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:48.200
So I'm just going to go into the admin section,

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.530
so add a forward slash and then admin at the end,

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.480
and then login with your details.

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:13.500
There we go. Okay. So because

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.790
we're importing all the information we need for this site,

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.830
I'm just going click on no thanks.

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.545
Taken straight into the dashboard.

00:03:23.545 --> 00:03:27.500
Okay. Search WordPress setup now on the live server,

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.265
and it's just got a default installation.

00:03:30.265 --> 00:03:36.345
So I'm going to get to work with exporting the details from our localhost version.

00:03:36.345 --> 00:03:39.045
So I'm going to go into the local version,

00:03:39.045 --> 00:03:41.580
and select pro headphones,

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:45.780
and you can do this with any of the websites which we built,

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:50.170
and then go into admin,

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.465
and then we need to go down to plugins,

00:03:54.465 --> 00:03:56.980
and then add new.

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:06.069
So if you just search for All-in-One WP Migration,

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:14.370
and this is what we need by ServMask.

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.070
So I've already got this plugin installed.

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:22.035
So all you need to do is click on install and then activate in the usual way,

00:04:22.035 --> 00:04:25.425
and then you should get a menu option in the dashboard.

00:04:25.425 --> 00:04:28.455
So if you go to the new option in the dashboard,

00:04:28.455 --> 00:04:34.690
and then click on exports and this will export our site as a package,

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:39.170
which you can then import into our live WordPress website.

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:43.950
Okay. So the first thing you know is there's a find and replace facility.

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:48.115
So we can find any word that we want to in the package,

00:04:48.115 --> 00:04:50.250
and replace it with something else.

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.330
So if we've got any sensitive information,

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:58.775
or wants to change admin's user name for example from root, we can do that here.

00:04:58.775 --> 00:05:01.400
There's also some advanced options,

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.570
where we can leave out various things such as spam,

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:08.315
themes, and plugins which you don't want to export,

00:05:08.315 --> 00:05:11.070
but I'm just going to leave it as default.

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:13.200
Click on export to,

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:17.010
and I want to export mine to a file.

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:21.100
So I'll just click on file and let that do it's thing,

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:23.900
and then once that's done,

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:27.115
we can click on the download localhost button.

00:05:27.115 --> 00:05:29.565
Now we get file,

00:05:29.565 --> 00:05:32.500
saved to our downloads.

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:36.900
So I'll just close that and then we're going to go

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:40.470
over to my live website and then do the same thing.

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:43.990
So it's plugins, add new.

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:51.070
So All-in-One WP Migration,

00:05:53.450 --> 00:06:03.610
and then install and activate,

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:09.374
and then this time we need to go to the options,

00:06:09.374 --> 00:06:17.310
and then go to import and then find the file which we just downloaded,

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:19.920
and then drag this into the drag and

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:29.700
drop and usually this

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:32.290
takes a minute to import.

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:37.970
Okay. Soon we get a message saying this will override our databases,

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:40.430
plugins, and themes, but we know that,

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:42.930
so click on continue.

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:54.710
Okay. So if all goes well,

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:58.460
we should get the message saying your data has been imported successfully.

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:01.145
So now we just got two more steps to do.

00:07:01.145 --> 00:07:04.325
One is we need to save our permalinks,

00:07:04.325 --> 00:07:07.085
so click on the permalinks settings,

00:07:07.085 --> 00:07:09.560
and it should open a new window,

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:12.500
and you'll notice if you try to login with

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:18.664
the details which we use when we set up the live WordPress installation,

00:07:18.664 --> 00:07:21.800
that we won't be able to login using those same details.

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.230
This is because the import we just done,

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:26.245
has also imported our user.

00:07:26.245 --> 00:07:31.130
So we need to use the same user details that we used for the localhost.

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:34.470
So mine was proheadphones-admin,

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:39.640
add the password, and then login.

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:43.910
So now we should be logged in with the existing user details from

00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:48.035
the localhost and now we need confirm our permalink settings.

00:07:48.035 --> 00:07:51.335
So once we're happy with one of the formats,

00:07:51.335 --> 00:07:54.569
we just need to click on save changes,

00:07:56.690 --> 00:08:00.390
and then once you've done that, we can head over to visit

00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:06.630
site and everything should look how it did on the localhost,

00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:09.300
so let's just take look at the homepage,

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:11.700
and everything looks good there.

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:18.915
So the blog page says our blog posts.

00:08:18.915 --> 00:08:24.280
Select these, and as the full version.

00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:27.580
The About Us page.

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:36.980
All looks good. Let's just add a new post and check everything's working okay.

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:45.690
So new post 4, doesn't really matter about the content for now.

00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:51.310
We've also got the images in the media library.

00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:52.690
So that's good.

00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:55.940
Let's set one of those and publish.

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:01.270
Let's go back over to the blog,

00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:05.050
and as our new post 4.

00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:09.150
So everything appears to be working good.

00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:15.550
Just try the search. Yeah, that's great.

00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:19.310
So that's how quick and easy it can be to export

00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:23.150
your website from a localhost to a live web server,

00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:27.640
when using a plugin such as All-in-One WP Migration.

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:30.245
Of course there are other ways to do this,

00:09:30.245 --> 00:09:33.810
such as exporting new database from your localhost,

00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:36.645
and also using FTP software,

00:09:36.645 --> 00:09:40.220
but this is a really quick and easy way to export you site,

00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:43.190
and hope you find it useful for when you're ready to move

00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:46.860
from a localhost to a live web server.
