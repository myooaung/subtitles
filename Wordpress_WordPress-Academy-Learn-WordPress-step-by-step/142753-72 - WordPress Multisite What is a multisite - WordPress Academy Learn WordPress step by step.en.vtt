00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:04.670
A really great feature of WordPress,

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:07.734
which has been available from version 3.0,

00:00:07.734 --> 00:00:10.480
is the ability to create a network of

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:15.380
websites by taking advantage of the multisite feature.

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:20.215
Throughout this section, we're going to create a network of websites,

00:00:20.215 --> 00:00:22.870
which is basically more than one website,

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:26.900
which all share the same WordPress installation.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:33.260
The actual network doesn't look too different from what we've been doing so far.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.840
But once we enable multisites,

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.910
we do have various different options available to us,

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:45.095
such as adding new websites which we want control within the network,

00:00:45.095 --> 00:00:49.835
allowing access to these websites by assigning administrators,

00:00:49.835 --> 00:00:52.940
and also deciding which plugins and which

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.920
themes we'd like to make available for each website.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.580
I'm currently in the Codex,

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.700
within the Create A Network section.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:10.225
As you can see, a multisite network can be very similar to your version of WordPress.com.

00:01:10.225 --> 00:01:14.420
WordPress.com is a website which we'll take a look at in just a moment,

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.605
which allows people to create their own websites or their own blog.

00:01:18.605 --> 00:01:21.980
Effectively, all the websites which you can create on

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:26.470
WordPress.com are all parts of a network.

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.915
If you would like to read more about creating a network,

00:01:29.915 --> 00:01:31.250
just simply search for

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.420
Create A Network within the Codex and you'll be taken to this page.

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.200
However, all the steps which are included on these websites,

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.010
we'll go through as we progress through this section,

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:46.445
so we get a hands-on feel of exactly how to do this.

00:01:46.445 --> 00:01:50.330
Next, I'm just going to head over to the Elegant Themes Blog.

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.560
Within that blog, there's a article

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.115
which is called 15 Amazing WordPress Multisite Examples in the Wild.

00:01:59.115 --> 00:02:01.075
Just do a quick Google search,

00:02:01.075 --> 00:02:03.070
I'm sure you'll be able to find it.

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:08.285
This website goes through some of the best multisite installations,

00:02:08.285 --> 00:02:10.670
which you couldn't find on the web.

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:16.415
Just as expected, the first one which springs to mind is WordPress.com.

00:02:16.415 --> 00:02:21.490
This is a multisite platform which has been around for quite some time.

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:27.560
It's actually got thousands of websites which are enabled as parts of the network.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.440
WordPress.com allows anybody to join

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.345
this network and create their own website or their own blog.

00:02:34.345 --> 00:02:37.265
It's really simple and easy to use.

00:02:37.265 --> 00:02:39.890
If you just head over to WordPress.com,

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.920
it's really simple to get started with this various different plans.

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.775
To get a WordPress website enabled,

00:02:47.775 --> 00:02:50.595
it's really simple as selecting your domain,

00:02:50.595 --> 00:02:53.630
your theme, the price and plan you'd like to go with,

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.890
and you can start from there.

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:59.790
Back over to the Elegant Themes website,

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.490
I will take a look at one or two more.

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:10.075
One of a large website using the WordPress multisite is the BBC America website.

00:03:10.075 --> 00:03:15.065
This particular website has every single show on its own website.

00:03:15.065 --> 00:03:21.350
Each one of these websites uses a child theme and it can all be administered separately,

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:27.390
if required, or we can assign various administrators to a group of sites.

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:36.375
Scrolling down, we also have the blog pages of The New York Times.

00:03:36.375 --> 00:03:39.210
It says it's got over 60 blogs,

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:42.554
so that means over 60 separate websites,

00:03:42.554 --> 00:03:45.885
all being part of the same WordPress network.

00:03:45.885 --> 00:03:48.410
As you can see, there's some quite large companies which

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.155
use the WordPress multisite feature.

00:03:51.155 --> 00:03:54.350
But just like with any feature or any piece of software,

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:58.620
there's always some pros and cons and multi-site is no difference.

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.890
There's always going to be occasions when it's good to

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:03.920
use and when it's not quite right for you.

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:09.570
Let's take a look at some multisite uses and also some of the drawbacks.

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:18.090
You can create your own network of blogs or websites either for personal or business use.

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.320
If you've got your own personal blog and you may have

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:26.240
various different niches and you want keep these different interests separate,

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.005
you can do that by using a network.

00:04:29.005 --> 00:04:32.660
You may also have a business and you may want some of

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:34.550
these business departments or

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:39.250
sections to have their own website or their own administrator,

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.375
and a multisite is ideal for that.

00:04:42.375 --> 00:04:48.535
Okay, so your company website requires different sections managed by different teams.

00:04:48.535 --> 00:04:55.070
This is a example which is similar to the BBC America example that we just looked at,

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.925
where different sections such as a different show,

00:04:58.925 --> 00:05:03.590
may be managed by different teams or may require a different style,

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:07.105
or a different theme, or a different set of plugins.

00:05:07.105 --> 00:05:10.505
Another good multisite case might be a business

00:05:10.505 --> 00:05:14.980
with multiple branches or different locations,

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:18.135
which you want to manage independently,

00:05:18.135 --> 00:05:22.400
or may you also want to allow anybody to create their own website,

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.585
whether that's a free website or a paid subscription.

00:05:26.585 --> 00:05:31.685
This case is similar to WordPress.com that we just looked at before,

00:05:31.685 --> 00:05:38.005
where we can invite end-users to join our network and create their own website.

00:05:38.005 --> 00:05:41.955
Of course, there are many more which I'm sure you can think of,

00:05:41.955 --> 00:05:47.740
but the last one which I've included in this example is for hosting client websites.

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:51.020
After building a website for a client,

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:55.210
you may want to include their website as part of your own network.

00:05:55.210 --> 00:06:00.455
Then after you built it, you can continue to look after the website or to administer it,

00:06:00.455 --> 00:06:05.515
as well as all the other websites which are part of your company or agency.

00:06:05.515 --> 00:06:10.295
All others just take some of the control away from some of the end-users.

00:06:10.295 --> 00:06:12.905
It does also provide many benefits,

00:06:12.905 --> 00:06:16.970
such as you can update all your websites at the same time,

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:22.889
which includes the WordPress core or any themes or plugins which you have installed,

00:06:22.889 --> 00:06:27.610
such some good reasons to use a WordPress multisite.

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:33.880
Now, let's take a look at some cons or some reasons when not to use a multisite.

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:36.645
The first one is pretty obvious.

00:06:36.645 --> 00:06:39.965
If you only need one website and you don't have

00:06:39.965 --> 00:06:43.930
any plans for any more or for any expansion,

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:49.390
obviously a standard WordPress installation is more than fine for that.

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:52.850
If you have a website and you want to be able to manage

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:55.969
your own themes or manage your own plugins,

00:06:55.969 --> 00:07:00.400
then a stand-alone website is definitely the way to go.

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:05.285
Or if your website has a good reason to require its own database,

00:07:05.285 --> 00:07:08.315
whether that's for security or any other reason,

00:07:08.315 --> 00:07:12.510
then a multisite is not necessarily a good choice.

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:17.675
If your website is hacked or if your website is down for any particular reason,

00:07:17.675 --> 00:07:20.600
this means that all the individual sites on the network is

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:24.895
down because they all share the same WordPress installation.

00:07:24.895 --> 00:07:29.190
Some plugins may not work well on a multisite network,

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:31.530
that's something to keep an eye on.

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:34.835
Before you went through the reasons to add

00:07:34.835 --> 00:07:38.170
all of your client websites onto the multisite,

00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:41.810
you may also find that a particular customer may have

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:47.125
their own hosting or may want to have more control over the website.

00:07:47.125 --> 00:07:51.880
The last reason I've listed is you may not have access or

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:57.080
the necessary permissions to edit the files which are on your web server,

00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:01.090
and this will cause a problem when activating the multisite.

00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:05.840
We'll take a look at exactly which files these are in the next few videos.

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:08.030
Now, let's move on to getting into

00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:12.780
our hosting account and activating the WordPress multisite.
