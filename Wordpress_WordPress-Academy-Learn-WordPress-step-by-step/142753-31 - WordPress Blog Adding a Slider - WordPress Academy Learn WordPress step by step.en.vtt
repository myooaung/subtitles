00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:05.490
Earlier in the course, we added

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.005
two different header images displayed just below this logo section.

00:00:10.005 --> 00:00:12.975
These two images will display randomly,

00:00:12.975 --> 00:00:16.935
so we may get a different image each time we reload this page.

00:00:16.935 --> 00:00:20.955
In this video, we're going to show you how we can use these same images,

00:00:20.955 --> 00:00:23.730
or you can even choose different images if you prefer.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.155
But we are going to incorporate them into a slider.

00:00:27.155 --> 00:00:31.400
Like with many things, WordPress has lots and lots of different slider plugins,

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:37.730
which we can integrate into our site or this actual theme comes with its own slider tool,

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.130
which is really simple to use.

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.810
First, we need to go into the customizer.

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:47.750
This is one of the options inside of the appearance and customizer.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.275
Then we'll see we have this slider option just here.

00:00:51.275 --> 00:00:56.015
Enter here. The first option is we actually need to activate the slider.

00:00:56.015 --> 00:00:59.150
So we'll click this and then we have the option if

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.720
you want this slider to appear in our Post page.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.440
We don't really need the slider to appear when we see the blog post.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.285
So I'm going to uncheck this.

00:01:08.285 --> 00:01:10.820
Well, this is totally up to you.

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.130
Then below this, we add our content,

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:14.350
which is the images.

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.655
To display in our slider,

00:01:16.655 --> 00:01:23.150
we can select an image from the media library or upload a totally different image.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:28.990
I'm going to stick with these same two images which we used already inside the header.

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.530
You can see straight away that this image has appeared still below the header one,

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.980
but this time we also have a Read More button.

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.860
We can also overlay some texts just above

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.909
this tool by adding a title and also a description.

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:48.300
So the title for this one is going to be Mobile Development.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.080
We can see these updates over in the preview.

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.730
On the line below we can also add a description tool.

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:00.800
I'm going to say from design to App Store.

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.120
If you want to, you can also change the Read More button text.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.025
First, I'm going to leave this as it is,

00:02:09.025 --> 00:02:12.520
but this is also going to link to a certain page.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.225
Since this particular image in this section is for mobile development,

00:02:16.225 --> 00:02:19.555
it would make sense to link to our mobile page.

00:02:19.555 --> 00:02:26.335
To do this, if we go to our site and then if we click on the "Mobile Development",

00:02:26.335 --> 00:02:28.510
all we need to do is to grab the page link,

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.385
which is the section just after this first forward slash.

00:02:32.385 --> 00:02:39.075
Command or control C to copy this and then paste this inside of our link.

00:02:39.075 --> 00:02:43.835
Slider content 2 is woken at our second image to rotate between.

00:02:43.835 --> 00:02:47.460
Again, I'm going to use the same one as the header.

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.750
A title of Web Design & Development.

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:00.549
A description, this will be WordPress development from the experts.

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.890
We also need to link to this page,

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.140
which is the Web Development page.

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.000
To go back over to our home page,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.100
we can click on the "Web Design and Development",

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:19.080
link and then grab the link to this page, paste this in.

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:24.090
Oops, wrong one. Paste this into number 2 and as you can see,

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.740
you can go even further by adding more images just below two.

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:32.315
So of course, we don't want the slider and also the header image at the same time.

00:03:32.315 --> 00:03:35.870
So what we could do is we will go back to the Header Image section,

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.660
or we can click on this pencil icon to go directly into our section.

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.565
Hide this image and then we just have the slider taken effect.

00:03:45.565 --> 00:03:50.700
Publish. Over to the front end and refresh.

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:56.590
That's our slider. This switches between our two available images.

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.365
Let's try if these links will work.

00:03:58.365 --> 00:04:00.770
This is the Web Design and Development page.

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:04.504
This one is fine. Back to the homepage.

00:04:04.504 --> 00:04:08.140
Our Mobile Development link is working too.

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:13.085
So this is all now working and this is how quick and easy it is to add a slider.

00:04:13.085 --> 00:04:15.020
In the next video, we're going to get to work on

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:20.670
our Contact Us page and replace this plain text with a contact form.
