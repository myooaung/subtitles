00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:07.785
Now we understand that WordPress needs a web server to actually run.

00:00:07.785 --> 00:00:10.320
In this video and also the next,

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.180
we're going to look at some options to get

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:16.305
started with creating a web server on our own computer.

00:00:16.305 --> 00:00:20.420
This video is going to focus on a service called Local by

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:25.370
Flywheel which will allow us to create a web server on our own computer,

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:28.480
and then we can create our WordPress websites.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.315
You only need to either follow this video or the next video,

00:00:32.315 --> 00:00:36.725
and the next video will focus on a alternative solution called MAMP.

00:00:36.725 --> 00:00:41.735
I would recommend that you follow along with this video rather than and the next one.

00:00:41.735 --> 00:00:47.040
To get started, we're going to head over to localwp.com.

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:51.440
From here we're going to click on the download button,

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.040
where we can download for both Mac, Windows and Linux.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.865
There's also a paid version for teams and agencies,

00:00:58.865 --> 00:01:01.705
but we just need the free community edition.

00:01:01.705 --> 00:01:07.565
Flywheel is going to allow us to quickly assess WordPress projects on our own computer,

00:01:07.565 --> 00:01:11.570
which is going to be really straightforward and take care of all the setup,

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.635
the server, and also the database for us.

00:01:14.635 --> 00:01:16.880
Local has lots of great features.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.465
We can view our site and admin section at click of a button.

00:01:20.465 --> 00:01:26.440
We can generate a live link to view our project anywhere and also share with others too,

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.210
along with a lot more advanced features such as

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.680
the ability to set up WordPress multi-site and so much more.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.245
Choose your particular platform,

00:01:36.245 --> 00:01:40.050
download and then go through the installation steps.

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.420
Once Local is fully installed and setup,

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.840
you're taken to a screen which looks just like this.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.520
This is where we can add and also manage our Wordpress sites.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.515
I already have some sites setup just here if this is your first time,

00:01:55.515 --> 00:01:58.065
you won't see any in the sidebar.

00:01:58.065 --> 00:02:00.710
To add on new project we need to click on

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.020
this green button in the left corner and then give our site a name.

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.770
I'm going to give this title of Festival,

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.215
and we don't need any of these advanced options for now.

00:02:11.215 --> 00:02:16.395
Continue, I going to stick with the preferred default environment.

00:02:16.395 --> 00:02:18.455
Then we need to add a username,

00:02:18.455 --> 00:02:20.900
a password, and an email.

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.930
The username, let's go for the festival_admin,

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.890
and this is going to be the details

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.190
we need to log into the back-end of our WordPress site.

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.950
We'll take a look at this in just a moment.

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:40.370
The password, make sure you change your email if needed to.

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.220
Click on Add Sites.

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:47.640
If you're going to using a Mac you may also need to add the administrator password too.

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.525
Good, once this is done our site is automatically started up.

00:02:56.525 --> 00:03:00.515
We can see this because we have the option to stop our site in the corner.

00:03:00.515 --> 00:03:02.930
If yours is green and it say start site,

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.020
you will need to click on this to start up the server.

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:09.350
We can see all the version numbers for our servers,

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:13.195
for PHP and also the database which we're using too.

00:03:13.195 --> 00:03:16.160
We don't need to change any of this information,

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.890
but it's all there if we need this in the future.

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.590
One of the great things about using Local is this live link down at the bottom.

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.455
We can click on Enable,

00:03:25.455 --> 00:03:29.890
and this will give us a live URL which we can share with others too.

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.600
This means we could share our work with colleagues,

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.160
with friends or family,

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:39.460
and it's also useful for getting feedback on our site to run other people.

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:44.525
We'll spend most of the time during this project in these two sections up at the top.

00:03:44.525 --> 00:03:49.615
We have a admin section which will link us to the back-end of our site.

00:03:49.615 --> 00:03:55.230
To login we need add in details which we added into Local just before.

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:00.550
My username was the festival admin and the password.

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:05.890
Click on Login and this will then redirect us to the WordPress dashboard.

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.470
The WordPress dashboard is like

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.590
the control center of our sites where we can add new features,

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:14.795
we can update it, we can change themes,

00:04:14.795 --> 00:04:17.605
and we'll take a look at this in just a second.

00:04:17.605 --> 00:04:20.750
The other button is to open our site,

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.780
and this is our actual WordPress website.

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.660
If yours looks a little bit different to this don't worry,

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:29.905
the default theme does change from time to time.

00:04:29.905 --> 00:04:34.635
This will now give us our back-end or front-end using these two terms.

00:04:34.635 --> 00:04:37.250
If we want to switch between these manually,

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.665
if we are on the site just like this,

00:04:39.665 --> 00:04:44.345
we can hover over the site title and then go over to the dashboard.

00:04:44.345 --> 00:04:47.030
When inside the dashboard we can do the opposite

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:49.825
and then head back over to visit our site.

00:04:49.825 --> 00:04:54.290
To the dashboard we'll take a closer look at all these options in the next video.

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:57.590
For it's from here where we can update our sites if we have

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:01.135
any themes and plug-ins or even the WordPress call.

00:05:01.135 --> 00:05:03.405
If any updates become available,

00:05:03.405 --> 00:05:06.170
we will be notified from this view.

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:08.675
We can manage and update our posts.

00:05:08.675 --> 00:05:14.150
We can upload different assets and media such as images, videos and audio.

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:15.965
We can work with our pages.

00:05:15.965 --> 00:05:17.970
We can edit them, we can add new,

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:20.840
we can manage any comments on our blog posts.

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:25.175
There is an appearance section where we can customize the look and feel of our site.

00:05:25.175 --> 00:05:27.200
We can upload different themes.

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:28.400
We can change menus,

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.175
background images, and lots more.

00:05:31.175 --> 00:05:34.505
We briefly talked about plug-ins early on and it's from

00:05:34.505 --> 00:05:39.065
this section where we can either manage our plug-ins or add new ones too.

00:05:39.065 --> 00:05:42.260
For example, if we wanted to add email to our site,

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.840
this is the plugin section where we could add this.

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:46.715
We can manage our users,

00:05:46.715 --> 00:05:48.290
such as seeing who is signed up.

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:50.300
We can change the preferences.

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:53.975
We can update profiles and permissions and lots more.

00:05:53.975 --> 00:05:58.685
We have a tool section where we can do things like importing and exporting data.

00:05:58.685 --> 00:06:03.610
We also have a setting section where you can fine-tune all of the options for our site.

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:06.260
For all of these projects in this course,

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.990
we will spend a lot more time in this back-end.

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:13.860
Starting in the next video we'll take a deeper look for all of these options.
