00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:11.520
Let's now scroll down to the bottom of our project and work on this footer area.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.320
For the footer area,

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:19.095
we are also going to making use of widgets to create up to four different sections.

00:00:19.095 --> 00:00:21.675
To do this, we go over to the dashboard,

00:00:21.675 --> 00:00:25.830
into the appearance, and into the widget section.

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.735
The themes author has provided four different footer locations.

00:00:30.735 --> 00:00:33.375
Psi bar 1 is over in the bottom left,

00:00:33.375 --> 00:00:35.455
then two, three, and four.

00:00:35.455 --> 00:00:37.520
Just like when we've used widgets in the past,

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.755
we can drag and drop any one of these widgets into our four different widget areas.

00:00:42.755 --> 00:00:46.085
You don't even need to use the same ones which I'm going to use.

00:00:46.085 --> 00:00:49.545
Bar sidebar 1, which is over on the bottom left,

00:00:49.545 --> 00:00:54.615
we want to drag in the pages widget. Pull this over.

00:00:54.615 --> 00:00:58.175
As we can see here, this is a list of your site's pages,

00:00:58.175 --> 00:01:01.250
but this is basically like a menu where the user can click on

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.550
all pages and then be taken to the full page.

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.550
We can add an optional title if we want to.

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.430
We can also solve these pages by the title,

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.450
the pages order which is available when we go to the pages edit screen,

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.505
or even the page ID.

00:01:16.505 --> 00:01:20.440
This page ID can also be used just below two if we want to

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.565
exclude any certain pages that we don't want to appear inside this section.

00:01:25.565 --> 00:01:33.255
The way to grab a page's ID is if we go into our pages link, click on this.

00:01:33.255 --> 00:01:37.990
If we click on any one of our pages or even go into the edit screen,

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.470
we can see the pages ID appear inside the URL.

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.630
This particular one is 1872.

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.100
Let's try a different one to contact us.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.955
This is 1874, but yours may be a completely different ID to mine,

00:01:51.955 --> 00:01:53.740
and that's completely fine.

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.580
The same too if we ever need to access any of the posts ID,

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.405
we can click on this.

00:01:59.405 --> 00:02:03.570
This is ID number one. Let's try one more.

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.360
This is 1788.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.935
This is really handy if you ever need know the post or the page ID.

00:02:09.935 --> 00:02:12.395
I go to the widgets.

00:02:12.395 --> 00:02:17.950
This is all saved and this is all we need for our sidebar 1 into the sidebar 2.

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.110
I'm going to drag and drop over a calendar widget.

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.390
This is a calendar of our site posts.

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.760
If you have a blog post available on a certain date,

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.910
this then becomes a link inside the calendar where the user can

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.045
click on and be taken to any of the posts for that particular day.

00:02:35.045 --> 00:02:37.800
We'll see what this looks like in just a moment.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.790
We can add an optional title,

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:45.050
but I'm just going to leave this as defaults since this is pretty self-explanatory.

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:50.590
Site buffering, this is one is going to be occupied by some social media buttons.

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.435
This is the ultimate social media plugin. Drag this over.

00:02:55.435 --> 00:02:59.110
This one was generated four rows from our social media page.

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:04.220
We can go to this page if we want to adjust any of the preferences with this link.

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.660
We can also change the title, but this is fine.

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.410
Sidebar 4 which is over in the bottom right of our page.

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.570
I'm going to drag over some recent comments.

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:19.045
Now, the recent comments are just the comments which had been placed on our blog posts.

00:03:19.045 --> 00:03:22.840
By default, this is the five most recent posts which we can adjust,

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.345
but five is fine for now.

00:03:25.345 --> 00:03:27.760
All these are automatically saved,

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.825
so if we go over to the browser, refresh the page.

00:03:31.825 --> 00:03:34.480
The first block is our pages and we can click

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.345
on any of these to be taken it to the full page.

00:03:37.345 --> 00:03:40.300
We have a calendar section and we can click on any of

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:44.965
these days and see any available blog post for that particular day.

00:03:44.965 --> 00:03:47.320
We can also scroll back and forward through

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.455
the dates and see the calendar view for each month.

00:03:50.455 --> 00:03:52.150
The social media section,

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.185
mostly the Twitter and also the YouTube links which we created earlier.

00:03:56.185 --> 00:03:59.260
Then finally, the five most recent comments,

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.975
which you can also click on if we wanted to.

00:04:01.975 --> 00:04:03.780
Now we have a footer section.

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.355
We could also remove the footer links down at the bottom,

00:04:06.355 --> 00:04:08.550
but this is fine for our use.

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:12.050
Just one last thing over in the customizer is not many options

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:15.380
for this particular theme for customizing the footer.

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.300
The only options we have if we go to

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:21.470
the footer link is to amend the number of widgets areas.

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:24.295
We are currently set to the default, which is four,

00:04:24.295 --> 00:04:26.780
but we could also reduce this down to you three, two,

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:31.860
or one if we prefer if we have less content to place inside the footer.
