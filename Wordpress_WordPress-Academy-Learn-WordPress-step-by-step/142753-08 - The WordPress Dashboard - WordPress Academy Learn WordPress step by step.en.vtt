00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.750
We had a quick preview of the WordPress dashboard,

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.705
just before when setting up our projects.

00:00:09.705 --> 00:00:14.760
This is the control center for our website where we can add new content,

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.405
we can update, and also delete our content too.

00:00:18.405 --> 00:00:23.490
We can also use it to install new features such as plugins or themes.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.320
But currently I'm not going to go too deep into the WordPress dashboard because we are

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.475
going to be jumping into all of these options in more depth throughout this course.

00:00:33.475 --> 00:00:36.300
To begin, we have this homepage which gives us

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.465
a status update where we can see our site is in good health.

00:00:40.465 --> 00:00:44.270
This is also a section where we can customize and

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.920
we can also see recent activity such as recent comments.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.900
We'll also get notified of any updates which is required

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.640
for WordPress and also any plugins or themes too.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.355
The first option over on the left is our blog post.

00:00:58.355 --> 00:01:00.110
When we first set a WordPress,

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.025
we see we have a hello world sample blog post.

00:01:03.025 --> 00:01:06.450
We can hover over this and we can edit this, we can remove this.

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.190
We can also see how many comments are being provided for this blog post.

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.150
We can add new and we can also create different categories and tags too,

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.395
so we can organize our blog post into different sections.

00:01:18.395 --> 00:01:21.800
Over this we have the media library which is a collection of

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.115
all of the assets which we need for our website.

00:01:25.115 --> 00:01:28.835
The media library can hold assets such as images,

00:01:28.835 --> 00:01:34.520
audio clips, video, and these are all organized into one easy-to-use library.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.890
We also have access to all of these assets when we create a new blog post and new pages,

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.355
so these are easy to select.

00:01:42.355 --> 00:01:45.080
After this, we have the pages section which

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.810
is laid out in a similar way to the blog post.

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.480
From here we can access all of the pages on our site,

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:51.680
we can edit them,

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.120
we can remove them,

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.645
and also add new with this button too.

00:01:55.645 --> 00:01:59.375
The comments section is related to our blog post.

00:01:59.375 --> 00:02:04.450
From here we can have full control over the way a user interacts with our blog.

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.735
For example, we can moderate them.

00:02:06.735 --> 00:02:09.005
If anybody has offensive comments,

00:02:09.005 --> 00:02:10.835
we can review them first.

00:02:10.835 --> 00:02:15.020
Then we can also remove them or allow them to be displayed on the website.

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.240
The appearance section is where we are going to be

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.535
controlling the look and feel of our site.

00:02:19.535 --> 00:02:21.350
We can upload different themes,

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.195
we can customize our current theme,

00:02:23.195 --> 00:02:25.655
we can organize widgets which are

00:02:25.655 --> 00:02:29.350
sections of content to display in different parts of our theme.

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.435
We can create and edit different menus for different parts of our sites,

00:02:33.435 --> 00:02:37.360
and also play around with different layouts and color schemes too.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:43.130
The plugins section is where we are going to manage all of the extensions for our sites.

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.740
This is where we add the different functionality which

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.850
is not included with the WordPress core.

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.990
For example, we're going to be using plugins,

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.330
which are going to add e-commerce functionality,

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.820
we're going to add e-mail functionality,

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:01.210
and as a plugin for pretty much any type of feature which you want to add to your site.

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:06.340
After this we have the user section where we can manage all of our users for our site.

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.545
Currently, we just have ourself because we've only just set up this site.

00:03:10.545 --> 00:03:14.255
Each one of these users is assigned a different role.

00:03:14.255 --> 00:03:17.270
We have full access to this dashboard

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:20.065
and we can upgrade all the content which we want to use.

00:03:20.065 --> 00:03:22.140
We have the administrator role.

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.965
But there is also other roles too which are for regular users,

00:03:25.965 --> 00:03:29.165
so they can't just log in to the dashboard and change our site.

00:03:29.165 --> 00:03:31.285
But more on this later.

00:03:31.285 --> 00:03:35.150
The tool section is going to allow us to do things such as importing

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.025
content and also exporting our data too.

00:03:39.025 --> 00:03:43.355
Finally, we also have lots of different settings or options for our site,

00:03:43.355 --> 00:03:45.455
and we're also going to get lot more familiar with

00:03:45.455 --> 00:03:48.385
all these options as we go through the course.

00:03:48.385 --> 00:03:51.920
So this is just a quick overview of what is included with

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.670
the WordPress dashboard and exactly what we can control too.

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.250
Next, we'll have a look at the files and folders

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.440
which are included when we set up WordPress.
