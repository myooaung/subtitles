00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:07.515
Our site now resembles and functions like a e-commerce store.

00:00:07.515 --> 00:00:09.300
Looks like when many businesses,

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.765
we also want to make this more custom to our own colors,

00:00:12.765 --> 00:00:15.510
our own layouts, and also generally make him more

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.440
branded it to our own company or our own personal image.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.750
As with a lot of the customizations,

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.500
we can go into the appearance and then into the customized section.

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.380
Here, we're just going to add some custom branding and also some colors.

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.000
We'll have lots of different options to do this on different pages.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.960
Or we can also add a same color scheme to all of our links,

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.175
all of our texts and all of our backgrounds for each one of the pages.

00:00:43.175 --> 00:00:46.535
First of all, before we do this into the site identity,

00:00:46.535 --> 00:00:47.960
which you've been in before,

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.670
we're going to first of all,

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.710
this changes be capitalized,

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.435
so this will be Shirt Store,

00:00:54.435 --> 00:00:58.815
and then the tagline which will be just underneath the subtitle.

00:00:58.815 --> 00:01:03.760
This one says custom and branded t-shirts.

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:08.600
Then also, we can add a site icon,

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.115
which is going to appear inside the top of the browser.

00:01:12.115 --> 00:01:15.090
From here, it's like this t-shirts,

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:22.570
the old text, like this,

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.135
I crop this to be the square-shaped to fit inside of the top.

00:01:27.135 --> 00:01:30.340
If we're happy with this, let's go ahead and publish this.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.465
We can see our icon up at the top,

00:01:32.465 --> 00:01:36.685
and then go back, and we can start to work through the rest of the options.

00:01:36.685 --> 00:01:39.225
The next one is the header.

00:01:39.225 --> 00:01:40.700
We can set a header image,

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:41.870
but we don't need to do this.

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:46.100
I'm just going to change the background color and also the text and links too.

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.525
First of all, the background color,

00:01:48.525 --> 00:01:52.310
you can move this color picker and choose any color which you would like.

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:58.500
But I'm going to go for the color which is a4c1c4,

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.480
and it's just this light green color we see here.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:10.530
The text color, I'm going to select 43454b.

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.035
Then the link color down on the bottom,

00:02:13.035 --> 00:02:16.200
this one will be f2f2f2,

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.955
which is a white color. Publish this.

00:02:20.955 --> 00:02:24.555
Then back from header into the main options.

00:02:24.555 --> 00:02:26.400
The footer down at the very bottom,

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.580
let's just keep this consistent with header and apply the same colors.

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.855
The background, to match the header,

00:02:33.855 --> 00:02:36.310
was the value of a4c1c4.

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.065
As this background color just here the text color,

00:02:43.065 --> 00:02:53.440
this was 43454b, and then the link color, which was f2f2f2.

00:02:54.020 --> 00:03:01.165
Publish this. Next, we can also tailor the color of these buttons too.

00:03:01.165 --> 00:03:03.755
This is the Add to Cart button and also the

00:03:03.755 --> 00:03:06.775
Select Options button for the variable products.

00:03:06.775 --> 00:03:11.045
This will have a dedicated buttons option just here.

00:03:11.045 --> 00:03:14.300
Also, if we wanted to change the background image or the color,

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.310
we could do this with the background option.

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.350
We can also change the typography color,

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.335
which will apply to all of our site,

00:03:20.335 --> 00:03:24.005
rather than just the header and the footer sections.

00:03:24.005 --> 00:03:27.350
For the buttons, I'm going to use the same color

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:30.725
which we've used in the background for the footer and also the header.

00:03:30.725 --> 00:03:34.500
This color was a4c1c4.

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:41.650
Also, the lighter text color, which was f2f2f2.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.545
Publish if you are happy with these changes,

00:03:45.545 --> 00:03:47.860
then back to the main menu.

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.410
We've already been through lots of the other options such as the layout.

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.760
We can change the position of the sidebar and we can go to the homepage control,

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.040
which we've already looked at.

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.885
This is to rearrange these sections and also remove any of them too.

00:04:01.885 --> 00:04:04.620
The menus and widgets we've already covered.

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.380
The homepage settings, these are also the same settings which we have from the sidebar.

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.980
If we go to the settings I'm reading,

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.470
this is just a chance to change the page which we use for

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:19.775
the front page of our site and also which page is used for our blog posts.

00:04:19.775 --> 00:04:22.420
But we've already set these previously,

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:27.035
but we also have some customer Woo Commerce options down at the bottom.

00:04:27.035 --> 00:04:29.465
We can set a stall notice,

00:04:29.465 --> 00:04:34.505
which we can enable to show on the screen if we have not yet published our site just yet.

00:04:34.505 --> 00:04:37.940
We can also use it for promotional messages and also if

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.660
we have any certain events coming up. Let's enable this.

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:43.445
We can see down at the bottom,

00:04:43.445 --> 00:04:46.760
this has been stuck to the bottom of our site.

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.164
This is also useful for things which are sales,

00:04:50.164 --> 00:04:54.440
but also to let the user know if there is any planned maintenance in the future.

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.560
Back from here, your product catalog,

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.530
many of these options are just the same as we have inside of

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:03.920
the products page or the Woo Commerce settings.

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:07.280
We can setup our pages to show either products or

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.885
just categories or a combination of both if you have chart categories.

00:05:11.885 --> 00:05:15.175
We can customize the sorting of these products,

00:05:15.175 --> 00:05:19.640
how many rows we want on the page and how many products for each one of these rows.

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:22.420
But I'm going to keep this as default.

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:25.440
The product page, we have the option to

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.370
make the Add to Cart button sticky, which it currently is.

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:31.940
This means it will stick to the top of the page. You see this.

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:34.180
If we go into one of our products,

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.680
we don't see it at the moment because we currently have

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.750
the Add to Cart button into our view.

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:40.880
But If we scroll this out of view,

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.480
this is the popup just at the very top here.

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:47.795
This gives us the chance to remove this if we don't want this to appear.

00:05:47.795 --> 00:05:52.515
The pagination. This is the buttons on the right and left,

00:05:52.515 --> 00:05:54.530
it's kept between these products.

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:56.105
We can uncheck these.

00:05:56.105 --> 00:06:00.265
These are now removed, so we'll just have to focus on a single product.

00:06:00.265 --> 00:06:02.370
Next, the product images,

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:04.260
we can set how we want the images,

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.180
crop or upload new ones.

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:11.135
Also an option to customize the fields inside of the checkout form too.

00:06:11.135 --> 00:06:14.480
If you wanted to, you could also create some additional pages for

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:17.930
the privacy policy and also the terms and conditions.

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:20.180
But I want to keep all these options as

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:24.700
default as most of them are pretty standard for an e-commerce store.

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:27.480
Publish any changes which you have made.

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:31.730
Close this down, and if we go back over to our front-end and refresh.

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:36.170
All the changes have now taken effect. Go down.

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:39.035
We have the buttons and also the footer area too.

00:06:39.035 --> 00:06:45.210
From the top, our side title and our tagline has also been updated too.

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:49.835
As a side note, if the width of the slide

00:06:49.835 --> 00:06:52.440
is an issue and you would prefer to have it wider,

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:55.370
we cannot change this over in our homepage.

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:58.030
The settings for this aren't available inside of

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:00.430
the slideshow options because the width of

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:03.265
this had been restricted by our Gutenberg block.

00:07:03.265 --> 00:07:05.995
Remember when we added this with our widget,

00:07:05.995 --> 00:07:08.645
this was a much wider section.

00:07:08.645 --> 00:07:12.745
If we go over to our homepage and then rather than pasting it,

00:07:12.745 --> 00:07:14.905
I will show a code directly just like this.

00:07:14.905 --> 00:07:19.690
What we can do is to add a new block and the block which we need for this,

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:21.220
we click on the plus icon,

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:23.245
is going to be this group.

00:07:23.245 --> 00:07:26.170
This group has some width options where we can

00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:29.455
select the wide width or the full width of the screen.

00:07:29.455 --> 00:07:33.790
Let's go for the wide option and then click on this plus icon.

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:36.570
You can then add a shortcode.

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:38.835
Let's first just copy this,

00:07:38.835 --> 00:07:43.680
the short code, and paste this in, update.

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:46.969
If I remove this original slideshow,

00:07:46.969 --> 00:07:51.765
top, auto site and refresh.

00:07:51.765 --> 00:07:55.404
This now gives us a much wider slideshow.

00:07:55.404 --> 00:07:59.195
Next, we're going to look at how we can create some more pages,

00:07:59.195 --> 00:08:05.460
but this time using a tool called Page Builder to create some really flexible layout.
