00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:06.810
Hi everybody. So I hope this section has given you a better understanding of PHP basics,

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.750
and that knowledge will come in really useful,

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.160
in the next section where we are going to be building our own custom WordPress theme,

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.305
and convert an existing website to WordPress.

00:00:17.305 --> 00:00:19.520
So as you go through the next section,

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.000
we'll be referring to the WordPress Codex,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.630
quite regularly, which you can find out the codex.wordpress.org.

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.980
So the Codex is the online manual for WordPress.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.035
It's a repository for WordPress information and documentation.

00:00:37.035 --> 00:00:40.110
It covers pretty much everything you need to know about WordPress,

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.200
including theme developments, plugin developments,

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.910
and how to contribute to WordPress,

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:48.850
and get involved with yourself.

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.704
We'll be using it a lot in the next section to browse through function references.

00:00:53.704 --> 00:00:58.550
So for example, if we want to know how to work with a particular function,

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.010
so such as the tags,

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.370
we can type in the search,

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.690
and then look for the function reference,

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.775
which is the tags,

00:01:07.775 --> 00:01:11.720
and then we can find out exactly how to use this particular function.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.920
We can find out a description about the function.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.485
We'll also have an example of usage.

00:01:18.485 --> 00:01:23.285
So we can often just copy and paste the function into our own theme.

00:01:23.285 --> 00:01:28.460
So this particular one includes the tags which are associated with a blog post,

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.430
displays them on the screen,

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.400
and you can often find out small information such as the parameters,

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.410
which the function takes in.

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:39.980
So for example, this one takes in before,

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.535
after and a separator.

00:01:42.535 --> 00:01:47.335
So before and after simply sets which text to display,

00:01:47.335 --> 00:01:50.420
before and after the individual tag.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.795
The separator is a value such as

00:01:53.795 --> 00:01:58.450
a comma or a dash which you wants put in between each one of the tags,

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.760
and if you don't quite find the function that you're looking for,

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.500
scrolling down to the bottom,

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.900
often has a list of related tags,

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.490
which you can take a look at,

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.020
and find exactly what we want.

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.360
So it's worth bookmarking the Codex as

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.749
a great resource for learning new things about WordPress,

00:02:20.749 --> 00:02:25.825
and also for checking up on example usage for things such as functions,

00:02:25.825 --> 00:02:28.890
and we'll see more of the Codex as we go for the next section.

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.675
So thank you, and now we'll move on to the next section,

00:02:31.675 --> 00:02:35.970
where we'll convert a existing website to WordPress.
