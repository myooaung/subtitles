00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:05.595
This is an option video to setup WordPress using a service called MAMP.

00:00:05.595 --> 00:00:09.930
If you successfully installed WordPress in the last video using local,

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:12.075
you can skip this video.

00:00:12.075 --> 00:00:16.080
However, if you use month before or you just want to try something

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.775
different you can follow along with this video and setup using MAMP.

00:00:20.775 --> 00:00:25.080
Let's get started by heading over to mamp.info.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.850
This is also going to create

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:32.400
a free local development server and also take care of the database for this two,

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.760
we can download a free version by clicking on the link

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.585
here and then download for your operating system.

00:00:39.585 --> 00:00:45.310
I'm going to go for the mac version and give it a few minutes to download.

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:48.980
Once this has downloaded,

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.170
will need to go through the installation steps to

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.950
your computer hit Continue through each one of these.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.540
May also need to add a password to to install this.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.660
MAMP also comes with a paid version called MAMP PRO.

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.715
This also downloads at the same time,

00:01:10.715 --> 00:01:12.335
but you don't need to use this.

00:01:12.335 --> 00:01:14.450
We just need to stick with the free version of

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.280
MAMP as we don't need any of the prophages.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.310
Once MAMP has finished installing to your machine

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.195
you will be taken to a star screen which should look just like this.

00:01:26.195 --> 00:01:29.975
You may also be asked to upgrade the MySQL database.

00:01:29.975 --> 00:01:32.470
I'll go ahead and do that too.

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:37.190
Inside here the key thing to note is the two green lights up at the top.

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.840
This means that our web server and also a database is open and running.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.470
We can now download the WordPress core and add this to our MAMP folder.

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.835
For me, MAMP is stored inside my applications,

00:01:50.835 --> 00:01:53.975
then we have this MAMP folder inside here.

00:01:53.975 --> 00:01:58.580
The key folder which we'll be working with is these htdocs.

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.370
This is going to be the location where we add all of

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.420
our WordPress projects throughout this course.

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.900
To do this we need to go to WordPress.org and from

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:13.400
the homepage will have a get WordPress button just down here.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.730
This then takes us to this download section where you can download the WordPress core.

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.075
This is a zip file it shouldn't take too long to download.

00:02:23.075 --> 00:02:29.595
Once this is done, we can click on this package and open this up.

00:02:29.595 --> 00:02:32.985
This is now our WordPress project folder.

00:02:32.985 --> 00:02:35.545
We can go ahead and rename this,

00:02:35.545 --> 00:02:43.380
I'm going to call this wpfestival Then we can drag this project over to our htdocs.

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.475
Let's grab this, places this inside of the htdocs,

00:02:48.475 --> 00:02:51.860
open this up and we can check this is that.

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:57.425
The next thing we need to do is to create a database for our project.

00:02:57.425 --> 00:03:02.350
Inside of the MAMP start screen we open up the webstar page.

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:05.595
From here we can go to PHPMYADMIN.

00:03:05.595 --> 00:03:07.500
If we click on tools,

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.880
click on PHPMYADMIN where we can add a new database.

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.590
You can see on the left I already have

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.560
many databases already setup but I'm going

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.205
to click on New and then create a new database.

00:03:22.205 --> 00:03:24.605
This can be any name of our choice.

00:03:24.605 --> 00:03:28.940
I'm what's called this, the wp-festival.

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:35.920
Click on Create, then we don't need to create any tables or any data.

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.905
Since WordPress is going to handle this photos.

00:03:38.905 --> 00:03:42.415
With this now sets up, we can go back over to MAMP,

00:03:42.415 --> 00:03:44.330
add to the start screen.

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:48.085
Now the older versions of MAMP used to have the preferences on here,

00:03:48.085 --> 00:03:50.904
but now it's available in the main options.

00:03:50.904 --> 00:03:53.680
If you're using a Mac, you can head to the MAMP icon in

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.430
the top corner and then click on the preferences link.

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.840
This will end that linkage to the section where you can check out which port we using.

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:07.630
If we click on ports we can see the default web server port is 8888.

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:11.945
We're now going to use this to access our project in the browser.

00:04:11.945 --> 00:04:15.520
All we need to do is to click on localhost.

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.595
Then 8888 hit Enter.

00:04:18.595 --> 00:04:22.220
Then we take it to the index of our htdocs.

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.885
This will contain all the project which we are inside a MAMP.

00:04:25.885 --> 00:04:28.330
We want the wpfestival.

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:33.085
Clicking on this will then start to up the WordPress installation scripts.

00:04:33.085 --> 00:04:36.280
The first step is to choose the language.

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:40.280
I want to go for English and then continue.

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.500
This page is just let us know we need to set up our database

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.250
first only to have access to all of this information.

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:55.100
Click on Let's go to the database name, which was wp-festival.

00:04:55.230 --> 00:05:01.919
The database username, which is roots and also roof for the password,

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:04.110
working on the localhost,

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:06.435
and then click on submit.

00:05:06.435 --> 00:05:08.410
Once connected to our database,

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:10.885
we can then run the installation scripts.

00:05:10.885 --> 00:05:14.100
We need to first of all add the subtitle.

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.830
I'm going to go for wp-festival.

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.959
This can be changed later on in the WordPress dashboard.

00:05:19.959 --> 00:05:22.495
Don't worry too much about this.

00:05:22.495 --> 00:05:28.285
We then need to add a username and password to login to a WordPress back end.

00:05:28.285 --> 00:05:31.225
I want to go for festival admin,

00:05:31.225 --> 00:05:34.795
a password and then also an e-mail.

00:05:34.795 --> 00:05:38.755
I'm going to uncheck this for now since society is not live.

00:05:38.755 --> 00:05:41.720
Then click on install WordPress.

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:46.740
We can then login using our details,

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.415
which we just provided.

00:05:48.415 --> 00:05:52.140
My username was festival admin,

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:55.570
then paste in the password.

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:01.940
This then takes us to the WordPress dashboard where we can control our site.

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:05.225
We'll take a look at this in more detail very soon.

00:06:05.225 --> 00:06:08.600
We can also click on this home icon just above the top.

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:11.635
This will then switches to our WordPress site.

00:06:11.635 --> 00:06:14.120
If you've go to the stage, congratulations,

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:17.670
WordPress is now open running using MAMP.
