00:00:03,403 --> 00:00:07,403
In this module we removed the hard coded reference to our Select

2
00:00:07,403 --> 00:00:10,403
All request and made it return our table data.

3
00:00:10,403 --> 00:00:15,355
We modified our unit test and our controller to use a post so

4
00:00:15,355 --> 00:00:18,403
that our Create could now return an object.

5
00:00:18,403 --> 00:00:22,778
We converted our anonymous inner class to an externalized RowMapper

6
00:00:22,778 --> 00:00:27,731
to be shared across multiple requests and finally we showed how to

7
00:00:27,731 --> 00:00:31,612
read an object after a create using the PreparedStatementCreator and

8
00:00:31,612 --> 00:00:40,000
then the SimpleJdbcInsert. Next we're going to look at updates in our application.
