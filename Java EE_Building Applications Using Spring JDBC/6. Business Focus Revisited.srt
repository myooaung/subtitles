00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:06,520
Let's look at that business focus slide again. That JDBC code that we

2
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:11,970
looked at earlier has all of this getConnection and DriverManager,

3
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:16,410
prepareStatement information, that huge finally block that essentially does

4
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:20,560
nothing but close connections for us, and now here's what our code could

5
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,640
look like using Spring JdbcTemplate.

6
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,780
Notice that nowhere in here is it mentioned that we have a connection or

7
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:33,970
a result set or a prepared statement, DriverManager,

8
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:39,410
it doesn't talk about closing stuff or how we handle any of that extra

9
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:42,940
code surrounding us doing that select statement.

10
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:49,050
We have our basic find method and return statement, and that's it.

11
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:53,430
This is a great example of the template method pattern and how Spring

12
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:59,540
JdbcTemplate utilizes that template method pattern to interact with our code

13
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:03,740
This may scare some of you that there is a black box with Spring and Spring

14
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:08,700
JdbcTemplate, and I hope to alleviate some of those concerns, but look at how

15
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,420
much smaller and more concise this code is,

16
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:14,340
and it really is just doing what we want to do.

17
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:23,000
There's no reason we should have to rewrite what's on the left for every query we need to make on the right.
