00:00:01.919 --> 00:00:06.419
Up until this point we have been working with only a single row in the

2
00:00:06.419 --> 00:00:09.697
database and that includes both creating and updating records.

3
00:00:09.697 --> 00:00:14.141
Spring JDBC has a convenient way, using a batch update,

4
00:00:14.141 --> 00:00:18.801
to pass in parameters and have it execute across multiple rows.

5
00:00:18.801 --> 00:00:22.507
To demonstrate this functionality we're going to add a

6
00:00:22.507 --> 00:00:31.000
column for ride_date to our database and then use the batch functionality to update it.
