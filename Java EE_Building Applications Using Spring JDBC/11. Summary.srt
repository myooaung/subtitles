00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:03,500
In this module,

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:08,540
we created a unit test and modified our controller, we

3
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:12,270
stubbed out our service and repository tier,

4
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:16,840
and then finally inserted a record using the JdbcTemplate

5
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:21,440
and then again using the SimpleJdbcInsert.

6
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,950
The next step is going to be reading records from the

7
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:32,000
database so that we aren't returning that null from our create method in the repository tier.
