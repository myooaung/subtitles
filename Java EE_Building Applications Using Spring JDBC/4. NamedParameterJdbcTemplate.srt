00:00:01,654 --> 00:00:05,083
Since the addition of var args to the JDK,

2
00:00:05,083 --> 00:00:09,654
a lot of people don't know or think about using named parameters.

3
00:00:09,654 --> 00:00:14,710
Named parameters allow us to lose the numbering of parameters in our SQL

4
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:18,563
statements and instead pass in a map of names with values.

5
00:00:18,563 --> 00:00:22,381
This is especially useful if you already have a map for some

6
00:00:22,381 --> 00:00:27,472
other reason in your application and just want to modify the

7
00:00:27,472 --> 00:00:29,654
database with that information.

8
00:00:29,654 --> 00:00:33,128
I should note that named parameters can be used for almost

9
00:00:33,128 --> 00:00:35,654
every function that we have done so far.

10
00:00:35,654 --> 00:00:37,654
So if you like this syntax better,

11
00:00:37,654 --> 00:00:41,083
you can use it instead of numbers in any of the SQL

12
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:49,000
we've done in our repository tier. Let's change our delete to implement this now.
