00:00:02.134 --> 00:00:07.818
We are focusing on the U of the CRUD functions, the Update.

2
00:00:07.818 --> 00:00:11.578
In this scenario, SimpleJdbcCall doesn't offer us much,

3
00:00:11.578 --> 00:00:16.023
so we will just use the JdbcTemplate for our updates.

4
00:00:16.023 --> 00:00:19.801
Oftentimes when updating records we will also want to

5
00:00:19.801 --> 00:00:22.801
update multiple record and we can use the batchUpdate

6
00:00:22.801 --> 00:00:25.134
options to help with this as well.

7
00:00:25.134 --> 00:00:30.197
Rather than writing a complicated SQL statement the batchUpdate

8
00:00:30.197 --> 00:00:42.000
will manipulate multiple rows in one call. We will update a single record as well as multiple records in this module.
