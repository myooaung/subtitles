00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:02.620
At the time of recording,

2
00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:07.180
the main page for DynamoDB had the following description: Amazon

3
00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:11.690
DynamoDB is a key‑value and document database that delivers

4
00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.440
single‑digit millisecond performance at any scale.

5
00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.030
It's a fully managed, multiregion, multimaster,

6
00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:22.150
durable database with built‑in security,

7
00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:27.940
backup and restore, and in‑memory caching for internet‑scale applications.

8
00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.440
So what exactly does all of that mean?

9
00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:35.240
Let's break it down because there's a lot packed into those two sentences.

10
00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:39.900
First off, DynamoDB is a NoSQL database service.

11
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.840
It is not a relational database.

12
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.340
Let me say that again.

13
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.640
It is not a relational database.

14
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.720
This gives you more flexibility in how you structure your data.

15
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:59.000
You can set up a table with different attributes or columns, add items, rows,

16
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.470
then later on add additional attributes to new items without

17
00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.840
having to redefine the table schema and migrate the data.

18
00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:13.300
DynamoDB is a key‑value database, meaning you have a unique key,

19
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.790
for example user ID, and some value associated with

20
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.340
that key, attributes like name, address, and employer.

21
00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.030
Different items may have different attributes,

22
00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.840
but they can all be stored in the same table.

23
00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.570
DynamoDB is also a document database, meaning you can store HTML,

24
00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.720
XML or JSON documents as items in tables and then read

25
00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.040
attributes from those documents.

26
00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:48.010
DynamoDB delivers single‑digit millisecond performance at any scale.

27
00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:53.640
Some databases start to slow down as table size or query volume increases.

28
00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.980
Dynamo is designed to maintain consistent performance no matter how large your

29
00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:03.640
table becomes or how many queries are issued per second.

30
00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.890
DynamoDB operates on a massive scale, handling over

31
00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.970
10 trillion requests per day,

32
00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:17.240
peeking up to 20 million requests per second over petabytes of data.

33
00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.320
Dynamo is fully managed,

34
00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.560
meaning the underlying hardware, provisioning, patching, and

35
00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.190
networking is taken care of for you. If you need to run in

36
00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.440
multiple AWS regions, that's supported natively.

37
00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.430
This helps distribute your traffic to geographic locations closer to your users,

38
00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.040
as well as mitigate the effects of a regional failure.

39
00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.860
It has multiple masters, meaning no single point of failure for your cluster,

40
00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.550
and active data is stored in multiple locations,

41
00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:52.140
preventing data loss from underlying hardware failure.

42
00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.510
Dynamo also has built‑in backup and restore. Continuous backups don't affect

43
00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.740
the performance or availability of your running database,

44
00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:05.080
and you can enable point‑in‑time recovery to restore your database

45
00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.740
to any given second in the proceeding 35 days.

46
00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:13.860
Security is also built in with default encryption at rest

47
00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.030
and the ability to use IAM to restrict user access to only

48
00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.340
their records within a table.

49
00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:26.200
Finally, in‑memory caching is also a native feature with DynamoDB Accelerator,

50
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.180
which is a fully managed in‑memory cache that can improve read

51
00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:36.470
performance by up to 10 times. To sum up Amazon DynamoDB from the

52
00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.140
initial long quote on the product page,

53
00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:46.240
it's a NoSQL database service that supports both key‑value and document storage.

54
00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.210
All of the features you need for a database are built in and managed,

55
00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:53.140
including multiregion availability,

56
00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.930
continuous backup and restore, data security and durability,

57
00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.440
and a caching solution to improve read times.

58
00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:12.000
One of the biggest takeaways from Dynamo is its ability to maintain high performance with both large tables and large volumes of queries.
