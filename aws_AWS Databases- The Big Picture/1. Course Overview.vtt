Hi everyone.

2
00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:09.230
My name is Craig Golightly, and welcome to my course,

3
00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:12.340
AWS Databases: The Big Picture.

4
00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.240
I am a senior software consultant.

5
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.110
Data is one of the most valuable assets for organizations.

6
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.990
How you store and organize that data can either enhance your

7
00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.040
operations and insights or limit what you can do.

8
00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.090
In this course,

9
00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:33.220
you'll learn to choose the best database type for each application and identify

10
00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:38.340
which AWS service you can leverage for your implementation.

11
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.240
If you're studying for the AWS Database â€‘ Specialty exam,

12
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.000
this course will help you understand foundational concepts before

13
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.310
diving into the details for each database service.

14
00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:54.070
Some of the major topics that we will cover include use

15
00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.240
cases for different database types,

16
00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:01.260
AWS services for various database types, and

17
00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.540
responsibilities of a database specialist.

18
00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.190
By the end of this course, you'll have a good understanding of database types,

19
00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.510
available AWS database services, and the

20
00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.380
responsibilities of a database specialist,

21
00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.540
including design, maintenance, and optimization of various database types.

22
00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:37.000
I hope you'll join me on this journey to learn about AWS databases with the AWS Databases: The Big Picture course, at Pluralsight.
