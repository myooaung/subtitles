Amazon Keyspaces is an Apache Cassandra‑compatible database service.

2
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:10,880
It has a lot of the same features as DynamoDB, so let's go through those.

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,300
First off, it's a managed serverless service,

4
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:19,040
so you don't have to install, maintain or patch softwares and servers.

5
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:22,210
You can also choose from on‑demand capacity mode,

6
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:26,390
which will automatically scale up and down to meet demand, or

7
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:29,360
you can select provisioned capacity mode,

8
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:34,040
which helps you optimize for price when you have predictable loads.

9
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:37,310
Whether you choose on‑demand or provisioned mode,

10
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:41,700
you'll get consistent, single millisecond response times whether you have

11
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,810
small or large datasets or high or low query volume.

12
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:47,530
Storage is also managed,

13
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:51,390
so you have virtually unlimited space, and continuous backups

14
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:54,830
enable point‑in‑time recovery, so if you decide you want to see

15
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:58,110
what your data looked like 10 days ago, you can do that.

16
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:00,540
Data is also encrypted by default.

17
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:06,000
Keyspaces is a good choice if you're looking to run your Cassandra workloads in the cloud.
