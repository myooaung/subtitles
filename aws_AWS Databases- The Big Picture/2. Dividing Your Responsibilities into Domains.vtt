00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:06.900
The AWS Certified Database ‑ Specialty exam separates the content into the

2
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:12.140
following five domains: workload‑specific database design,

3
00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:16.590
deployment and migration, management and operations,

4
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.010
monitoring and troubleshooting, and database security.

5
00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:25.410
These domains are a useful way to break down the topic areas you need to

6
00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.240
know, not only for taking the exam if you plan to certify,

7
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.570
but for working with AWS databases in general. These topics

8
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.770
help you cover the breadth of requirements to consider as you

9
00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.710
implement database solutions.

10
00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.180
We'll go into more detail on each domain in this course, then individual

11
00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.310
courses on different database offerings will cover specifics for

12
00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:50.940
implementations in each database service. For example,

13
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.420
I'll cover database security concepts, then in the RDS course,

14
00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.920
you'll see how to implement security in RDS. Then in the DynamoDB

15
00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:05.090
course, you'll see implementation options for security in DynamoDB,

16
00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:07.940
and so on for each covered service.

17
00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.720
Domain one, workload‑specific database design.

18
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.410
This domain has the following objectives: select appropriate database

19
00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:23.510
services for specific types of data and workloads, determine strategies for

20
00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:28.430
disaster recovery and high availability, design database solutions for

21
00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:34.280
performance, compliance, and scalability, compare the costs of database

22
00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.420
solutions. These objectives get into knowing everything about everything in

23
00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.740
order to select the appropriate database service or services to use based on

24
00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.390
the type of data involved and other implementation requirements, such as

25
00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.730
performance, compliance, scalability, and cost.

26
00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:57.370
These objectives will help you know the breadth of services and their

27
00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:02.340
different capabilities so you can design the best possible solution.

28
00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.270
Domain two, deployment and migration.

29
00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.060
This domain covers the following objectives:

30
00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.140
automate database solution deployments,

31
00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.790
determine data preparation and migration strategies,

32
00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.600
execute and validate data migration. Automation is an

33
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.440
important way to reduce deployment time,

34
00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:29.140
increase repeatability, and eliminate mistakes as you deploy database solutions.

35
00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.020
Using tools like CloudFormation can help you develop robust

36
00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.740
automation with AWS database deployments.

37
00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.840
As systems first move to the cloud or evolve within the cloud,

38
00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.940
you'll find that you need to perform a fair amount of data preparation,

39
00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.290
migration, and validation, so understanding best practices

40
00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.830
and available tools for those tasks is an important part of

41
00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.140
being a database specialist.

42
00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:01.220
Domain three, management and operations This domain is all

43
00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.590
about keeping things up and running,

44
00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.550
as well as having the appropriate backup and restore

45
00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:09.630
strategies in place when failures occur.

46
00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.020
Objectives for this domain are: determine maintenance tasks and

47
00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:19.120
processes, determine backup and restore strategies, manage the

48
00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.470
operational environment of a database solution. Domain four, monitoring

49
00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.000
and troubleshooting, has the following objectives: determine monitoring

50
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.210
and alerting strategies, troubleshoot and resolve common database

51
00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:38.490
issues, optimize database performance. Monitoring is a key part of your

52
00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:40.040
database solution.

53
00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.750
It's what allows you to measure performance, spot slowdowns and anomalies,

54
00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.590
and alert the appropriate resources when things go wrong.

55
00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.060
The objectives for this domain will help you be aware of common

56
00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.310
issues for each database service, how to solve those issues, and

57
00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.840
different options for monitoring, alerting, and optimization.

58
00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:01.610
Finally,

59
00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:06.640
domain five, database security. Security needs to be built into your

60
00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.970
design and is too important to simply be an afterthought, thrown

61
00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.210
together after everything else is working.

62
00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:16.120
The security objectives cover several areas,

63
00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:22.690
including encrypt data at rest and in transit, evaluate auditing solutions,

64
00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:27.840
determine access control and authentication mechanisms, recognize potential

65
00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.890
security vulnerabilities within database solutions. Different database

66
00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:35.870
services have different options for encryption,

67
00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.400
auditing, and access control,

68
00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.200
so you'll need to be aware of your options in order to meet any

69
00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.370
specific security requirements you may have.

70
00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:50.090
You can use AWS databases to implement solutions that are compliant with

71
00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:54.640
several financial, privacy, and government standards.

72
00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:58.140
Cloud does not equal less secure.

73
00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:01.820
Another component of security is monitoring and detecting

74
00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.390
potential threats and vulnerabilities,

75
00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:11.140
and AWS has several tools to make that easier for you.

76
00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:15.270
Great job! You've seen what it means to be a database specialist,

77
00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:19.360
including the breadth and depth of knowledge needed to design,

78
00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:24.790
deploy, and maintain database solutions that meet multiple constraints.

79
00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:27.590
You've covered the domains and objectives for the AWS

80
00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:30.040
Certified Database ‑ Specialty exam,

81
00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:33.250
which helped organize the different topics where you'll dive in

82
00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:37.430
deeper to gain the skills you need to implement real‑world

83
00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:41.190
scenarios. Join me in the next module where you'll get an

84
00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:50.000
overview of each AWS database service, including the types of data and use cases they're designed to handle.
