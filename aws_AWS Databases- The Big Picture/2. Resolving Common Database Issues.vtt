00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:05.370
Depending on your database type, monitoring won't always take the form

2
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.230
of looking at CPU utilization and disk I/O. For example, managed

3
00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:17.230
serverless databases like DynamoDB provide performance in terms of read

4
00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.340
request units and write request units.

5
00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.730
You can choose to use an on‑demand mode where Dynamo will automatically

6
00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.340
scale up and down to match your load or provisioned mode where you

7
00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.410
specify a certain read and write unit capacity.

8
00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.030
There are cost and performance differences between the two options,

9
00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.640
so you'll have to determine which option is best for you based

10
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.620
on your application requirements and budget.

11
00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.950
For services like RDS, Redshift, and ElastiCache,

12
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.520
you'll be looking for spikes in resources to determine if a

13
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.850
certain resource is being taxed such as CPU,

14
00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.640
RAM or disk.

15
00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.960
When using these instance‑based database services,

16
00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.430
you'll need to be aware of errors such as full disk error if you run out of

17
00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.760
storage, network errors such as running out of IP addresses in a subnet when

18
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.200
trying to launch new instances, database status messages,

19
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.260
including those that are nonrecoverable where you'll have to spin up a new

20
00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:25.660
database instance to solve the problem, and native error messages that are

21
00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.040
unique to the database engine you're using.

22
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.400
Finally, with all database types,

23
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.390
you may need to troubleshoot access problems such as timeouts,

24
00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:44.000
missing certificates, and other credential problems that prevent applications or users from accessing the database.
