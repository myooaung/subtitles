00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:03.660
Let's start out defining a couple of terms that

2
00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:10.340
relate to database backup and restore, RTO and RPO.

3
00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:11.110
RTO,

4
00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:16.230
or Recovery Time Objective, represents how quickly you

5
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.340
need to recover from a disaster.

6
00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:23.540
For example, if something happened to your database at 9:00 a.m.

7
00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:27.430
and you wanted it operational again by 10:00 a.m.,

8
00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.840
then your RTO would be 1 hour.

9
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.710
RPO, or Recovery Point Objective,

10
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.540
represents how much data you can afford to lose or recreate.

11
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:40.710
In other words,

12
00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.370
what is the maximum gap of data you are willing to have

13
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.650
between a recovery point and a disaster?

14
00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.740
For example, if the database went down at 9:00 a.m.

15
00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:55.530
and you wanted data from up to 8:30 a.m.

16
00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:02.300
to be included in the restored database, your RPO would be 30 minutes.

17
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.350
In other words,

18
00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.940
your restored database should only be missing the previous

19
00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.170
30 minutes of data before the disaster.

20
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:17.330
RTO and RPO requirements influence both your backup and restore strategy.

21
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:18.600
In this example,

22
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.880
the backup would need to take less than 30 minutes to complete to

23
00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.540
maintain an RPO of 30 minutes, and the restore would need to take less

24
00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.640
than an hour to maintain an RTO of 1 hour.

25
00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.010
Different backup and restore methods may not meet your time requirements,

26
00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:42.350
so you may need to look at options like replication and warm or hot standbys

27
00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.740
instead of simply restoring a new instance from a backup.

28
00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.790
RTO and RPO will dictate your backup frequency and, to some extent,

29
00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:57.340
the location, or locations, where you will store those backups.

30
00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.350
So why not just always implement an active‑active

31
00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.970
multi‑region database solution?

32
00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:07.940
Well, first, it may not be supported for a given database service.

33
00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.830
Second, you may not have time to implement such a solution.

34
00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.220
Third, you may not have enough budget to pay for that solution.

35
00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.140
And fourth, it may be overly complex for the database deployment.

36
00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.090
When you begin your database design by defining a realistic

37
00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.940
RTO and RPO for your database deployment,

38
00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.370
it's easier to balance your availability

39
00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.350
requirements with the constraints of time,

40
00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.190
cost, and complexity.

41
00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:37.260
For example,

42
00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.960
a test database may not really have an RPO or RTO

43
00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.260
because all of the data is generated.

44
00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.740
And if you need a new one, you can just make a new one.

45
00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.200
You don't need to preserve any transactions that are

46
00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.500
created during the lifetime of the database,

47
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.860
so there is very little value in spending the resources to

48
00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.010
replicate this database across regions.

49
00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.630
Other mission‑critical systems, on the other hand,

50
00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.140
where every second the system is down could cost the

51
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:12.230
organization thousands of dollars, would need to have a very low RTO and RPO,

52
00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.140
usually measured in seconds.

53
00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:16.500
In these cases,

54
00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.950
it does make sense to invest in the infrastructure that can support a

55
00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.840
near‑instantaneous failover in the event of a disaster.

56
00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.370
If disaster recovery and failover speed are critical

57
00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.840
elements of your database deployment,

58
00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.480
be sure to select a database service that can support

59
00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.940
those RPO and RTO requirements.

60
00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.050
Some managed services, like Amazon Aurora Global Database,

61
00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:50.040
can support an RPO of 1 second and an RTO of less than 1 minute.

62
00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.100
Other services may not be able to achieve those recovery times,

63
00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.920
so be sure to understand the capabilities of the

64
00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.740
database service when making your decision.

65
00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:02.870
Great job!

66
00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:07.210
You've covered routine maintenance tasks that need to be taken care of for your

67
00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:11.540
database including making sure you have enough disk space,

68
00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:15.240
keeping your database engine patched and updated,

69
00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:16.980
managing log files,

70
00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:21.340
and establishing a maintenance window for performing these activities.

71
00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.260
You saw how managed database services can help lower your

72
00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.220
maintenance responsibility by automatically taking care of many

73
00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.820
of these things for you and how you may sometimes need to

74
00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.980
implement unmanaged services yourself,

75
00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:41.440
depending on the level of control you need over database configuration settings.

76
00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.250
Finally, we defined Recovery Time Objective,

77
00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:50.240
or RTO, and Recovery Point Objective, or RPO,

78
00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:56.140
and how those two requirements influence your backup and restore strategy,

79
00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:59.000
along with the familiar constraints of time,

80
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.940
cost, complexity, and database engine support.

81
00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:10.000
Join me in the next module where we'll discuss monitoring and troubleshooting databases.
