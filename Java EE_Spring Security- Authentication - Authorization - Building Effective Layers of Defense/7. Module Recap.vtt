00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:02.773
In this module,

2
00:00:02.773 --> 00:00:06.947
you learned how to implement hash-based and persistent token remember-me,

3
00:00:06.947 --> 00:00:12.670
the differences between them, and security challenges they pose.

4
00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:17.674
We revisited logging out and implemented a more secure logout.

5
00:00:17.674 --> 00:00:19.079
And finally,

6
00:00:19.079 --> 00:00:22.306
you learned how to add a CAPTCHA using Google

7
00:00:22.306 --> 00:00:25.835
reCAPTCHA to the registration page.

8
00:00:25.835 --> 00:00:28.602
If you have been following this course, you can see,

9
00:00:28.602 --> 00:00:33.064
even with Spring Security, getting authentication right can be a challenge.

10
00:00:33.064 --> 00:00:34.919
Hence, in the next module,

11
00:00:34.919 --> 00:00:43.000
we will look at outsourcing authentication to a third party, like Google or Facebook using OAuth.
