00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,327
Hi everyone.

2
00:00:02,327 --> 00:00:09,712
My name is Wojciech Lesniak, and welcome to my course,

3
00:00:09,712 --> 00:00:12,832
Spring Security: Authentication and Authorization -

4
00:00:12,832 --> 00:00:15,781
Building Effective Layers of Defense.

5
00:00:15,781 --> 00:00:22,946
I have been using Spring now, back before it was even called Spring Security.

6
00:00:22,946 --> 00:00:26,174
Getting security wrong can have significant repercussions,

7
00:00:26,174 --> 00:00:28,796
especially to your users.

8
00:00:28,796 --> 00:00:29,873
Hence, in this course,

9
00:00:29,873 --> 00:00:34,082
we will take a peek under the covers of Spring Security at the moving parts,

10
00:00:34,082 --> 00:00:36,982
which will allow you to more effectively mold the

11
00:00:36,982 --> 00:00:40,372
framework around your security requirements.

12
00:00:40,372 --> 00:00:43,611
Some of the major topics that we will cover include

13
00:00:43,611 --> 00:00:46,634
multi-factor authentication; user sign-in,

14
00:00:46,634 --> 00:00:50,410
additional security challenges, two-factor authentication,

15
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:54,516
email verification, and enforcing HTTPS,

16
00:00:54,516 --> 00:00:58,612
authorization in your pages, URLs, methods,

17
00:00:58,612 --> 00:01:03,726
and domain objects; dealing with common security threats and how Spring

18
00:01:03,726 --> 00:01:07,449
Security protects you against them right out of the box; securing

19
00:01:07,449 --> 00:01:11,519
secrets and user credentials; social sign-in,

20
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:14,263
outsourcing authentication with Spring Security OAuth2.

21
00:01:14,263 --> 00:01:16,736
By the end of this course,

22
00:01:16,736 --> 00:01:19,769
you will have a deeper understanding of the Spring Security framework,

23
00:01:19,769 --> 00:01:23,929
allowing you to tailor it to your security requirements,

24
00:01:23,929 --> 00:01:28,969
as well as allowing you to more easily debug issues when they inevitably arise.

25
00:01:28,969 --> 00:01:30,439
Before beginning the course,

26
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:33,516
you should be familiar with Java and the Spring framework.

27
00:01:33,516 --> 00:01:37,495
I hope you will join me on this journey to learn how to build secure

28
00:01:37,495 --> 00:01:51,000
applications with the Spring Security Authentication and Authorization: Building Effective Layers of Defense course at Pluralsight.
