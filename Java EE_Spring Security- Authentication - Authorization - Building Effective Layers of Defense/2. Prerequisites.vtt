00:00:01.832 --> 00:00:05.493
So what are the prerequisites for this course?

2
00:00:05.493 --> 00:00:10.396
A basic understanding of the Spring framework is required.

3
00:00:10.396 --> 00:00:15.520
Knowledge of Spring MVC is useful, but not essential.

4
00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:22.123
If you're planning to use the demos, then setting up Lombok would be recommended.

5
00:00:22.123 --> 00:00:25.374
Other requirements, a minimum of Java 8,

6
00:00:25.374 --> 00:00:28.657
Maven 3 if you plan to build the demos,

7
00:00:28.657 --> 00:00:34.352
and I'll be using Spring Tool Suite 3.9 in my demos.

8
00:00:34.352 --> 00:00:39.695
If you're already familiar with Lombok, then please feel free to skip this part.

9
00:00:39.695 --> 00:00:43.706
Lombok is a Java library that automatically plugs

10
00:00:43.706 --> 00:00:46.589
into your editor and build tools.

11
00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:49.577
It helps to speed up development by taking care of

12
00:00:49.577 --> 00:00:53.505
a lot of the boilerplate code, like constructors,

13
00:00:53.505 --> 00:00:56.671
getters, setters, equal and hash code,

14
00:00:56.671 --> 00:01:01.029
and much more so that you can focus on the important parts of the application,

15
00:01:01.029 --> 00:01:05.572
like the business and security aspects.

16
00:01:05.572 --> 00:01:10.848
Once you Lombok, you can't go back.

17
00:01:10.848 --> 00:01:21.000
You can find more information about Lombok on their website and also the installation instructions at the following URL.
