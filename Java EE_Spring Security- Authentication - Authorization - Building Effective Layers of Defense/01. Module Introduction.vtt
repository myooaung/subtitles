Hi, my name is Wojciech Lesniak,

2
00:00:05.739 --> 00:00:11.183
and welcome to this module on Layering Authorization with Spring Security.

3
00:00:11.183 --> 00:00:13.718
Spring Security allows you to configure authorization

4
00:00:13.718 --> 00:00:19.500
at many layers from your JSP page, the URL,

5
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.430
your methods, and the instances of your domain objects.

6
00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:25.072
In this module,

7
00:00:25.072 --> 00:00:30.006
we will take a look under the hood of Spring Security authorization,

8
00:00:30.006 --> 00:00:31.776
at the moving parts,

9
00:00:31.776 --> 00:00:35.105
and you will learn the power of Spring expressions to

10
00:00:35.105 --> 00:00:38.494
tailor authorization to your specific needs,

11
00:00:38.494 --> 00:00:43.161
how to secure your URLs, pre and post authorize,

12
00:00:43.161 --> 00:00:46.184
and filter method annotation using

13
00:00:46.184 --> 00:00:49.164
ExpressionEvaluator and hasPermission expressions,

14
00:00:49.164 --> 00:00:53.039
how to configure Spring's access control list,

15
00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.375
Spring's implementation of the ExpressionEvaluator

16
00:00:55.375 --> 00:00:58.868
to secure your domain objects.

17
00:00:58.868 --> 00:01:00.083
By the end of this module,

18
00:01:00.083 --> 00:01:10.000
you will learn how to tailor authorization in your applications to meet your security requirements using Spring Security.
