00:00:02.007 --> 00:00:03.964
Let's revisit logging out.

2
00:00:03.964 --> 00:00:07.019
Previously we implemented the logout using a controller so

3
00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:09.957
that we could use the HTTP get method.

4
00:00:09.957 --> 00:00:14.449
Now this leaves logout exposed to cross-site request forgery.

5
00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:17.724
Also, currently the logout is no longer working.

6
00:00:17.724 --> 00:00:21.389
The reason is the remember-me cookie keeps logging us back in.

7
00:00:21.389 --> 00:00:25.875
We need to remove the remember-me cookie when the user logs out.

8
00:00:25.875 --> 00:00:27.099
In the Configuration class,

9
00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:33.550
we can use the HttpSecurity object to access the logout filter builder.

10
00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:41.583
Set the logoutUrl and the URL to redirect to once successfully logged out,

11
00:00:41.583 --> 00:00:49.975
in this case, back to the login page, and finally the cookies we want to delete.

12
00:00:49.975 --> 00:00:51.500
Now one additional thing.

13
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.611
We need to change the logout link to use POST.

14
00:00:54.611 --> 00:00:57.564
In this case, change it to a button and a form,

15
00:00:57.564 --> 00:01:00.502
which includes the cross-site request forgery token.

16
00:01:00.502 --> 00:01:02.661
Now I'm using Thymeleaf,

17
00:01:02.661 --> 00:01:12.000
which automatically includes the cross-site request forgery token in each form. We are now able to log out successfully.
