00:00:01,971 --> 00:00:05,318
If you're using JSP, Spring provides a tag library,

2
00:00:05,318 --> 00:00:08,456
which you can add to your JSP pages.

3
00:00:08,456 --> 00:00:13,781
Also, we need the Spring-security-taglibs dependency in our POM file.

4
00:00:13,781 --> 00:00:16,441
This then gives you access to two key tags,

5
00:00:16,441 --> 00:00:19,450
the authorize and authentication tag.

6
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:23,880
The authorize tag allows you to selectively display parts of the page based

7
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:28,979
on the user's authorities or the security configuration.

8
00:00:28,979 --> 00:00:32,232
Here on our portfolio page, we have the Admin link,

9
00:00:32,232 --> 00:00:37,939
which links to the admin section that requires the admin role.

10
00:00:37,939 --> 00:00:42,988
Now if the user does not have this role, it throws the AccessDeniedException.

11
00:00:42,988 --> 00:00:47,882
A better approach would be to only display this link to admin users.

12
00:00:47,882 --> 00:00:51,385
We can use the authorize tag to achieve this.

13
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:55,105
Using the access property to add the Spring expression

14
00:00:55,105 --> 00:01:01,293
like hasRole ADMIN or the URL property to check if the

15
00:01:01,293 --> 00:01:04,183
user has access to the admin URL.

16
00:01:04,183 --> 00:01:09,084
This will check the configuration in our configuration class.

17
00:01:09,084 --> 00:01:12,579
The authentication tag gives you access to the authentication

18
00:01:12,579 --> 00:01:17,048
principal in case you want to display the name or any sort of

19
00:01:17,048 --> 00:01:20,851
details about the principal, properties like email name,

20
00:01:20,851 --> 00:01:21,319
etc.

21
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:25,962
In this case, we could add the user's name to the top-right corner of the page.

22
00:01:25,962 --> 00:01:29,752
Now I'm actually using Thymeleaf, which is a templating engine.

23
00:01:29,752 --> 00:01:33,588
So my page is an HTML page and not a JSP.

24
00:01:33,588 --> 00:01:35,523
Hence, this won't work for me.

25
00:01:35,523 --> 00:01:38,389
But Thymeleaf gives me access to the security tags.

26
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:44,362
I just use the security tag within HTML objects.

27
00:01:44,362 --> 00:01:46,769
Okay, let's give this a test.

28
00:01:46,769 --> 00:01:50,044
As you can see, the admin button is no longer present.

29
00:01:50,044 --> 00:01:52,449
However, don't be fooled.

30
00:01:52,449 --> 00:01:56,064
These tags adjust for aesthetics, look and feel.

31
00:01:56,064 --> 00:01:58,529
Don't rely on them for security.

32
00:01:58,529 --> 00:02:02,321
If I simply type in the URL at the top for the admin page,

33
00:02:02,321 --> 00:02:12,000
it will go directly to the admin controller. Next we will look at how you can address this by protecting your URLs.
