you learned authorization in depth starting at the page

00:00:06.898 --> 00:00:10.518
level with Spring Security tag library followed by the URL

4
00:00:10.518 --> 00:00:12.401
in the configuration class,

5
00:00:12.401 --> 00:00:17.473
then method level with the pre and post authorize and filter annotations,

00:00:24.162 --> 00:00:28.245
This concludes the module and the course for Spring Security.

00:00:28.245 --> 00:00:32.060
If you have been following the course from the start, well done.

10
00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.472
You are now able to effectively layer your authorization and
