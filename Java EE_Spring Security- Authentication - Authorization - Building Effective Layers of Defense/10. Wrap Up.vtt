00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:08.089
In summary, we took a peek under the covers of Spring Security authentication,

2
00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:11.251
at the filters and filter chains that make up the framework.

3
00:00:11.251 --> 00:00:15.758
We looked at how an authentication request is authenticated,

4
00:00:15.758 --> 00:00:18.847
the key components, like the AuthenticationManagers,

5
00:00:18.847 --> 00:00:22.329
Providers, and the UserDetailsService.

6
00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:23.152
Spring Boot,

7
00:00:23.152 --> 00:00:26.157
the default configuration and how it makes

8
00:00:26.157 --> 00:00:28.422
decisions to configure Spring Security.

9
00:00:28.422 --> 00:00:31.133
We also looked at how you can customize it,

10
00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:35.642
how to configure basic, form, and digest authentication.

11
00:00:35.642 --> 00:00:38.784
And we also looked at the vulnerabilities of our

12
00:00:38.784 --> 00:00:41.536
application and digest authentication.

13
00:00:41.536 --> 00:00:42.412
In the next module,

14
00:00:42.412 --> 00:00:46.793
we will look at how Spring Security protects against some of the most common

15
00:00:46.793 --> 00:00:50.205
security threats that your web application might face,

16
00:00:50.205 --> 00:00:54.032
such as cross- site request forgery, click checking,

17
00:00:54.032 --> 00:00:58.659
and more, as well as how to set up HTTPS and HSTS,

18
00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:03.895
HTTP-strict transport security to enforce HTTPS and prevent downgrade

19
00:01:03.895 --> 00:01:12.000
attacks and cookie hijacking in your applications. So I hope you will join me in the next module.
