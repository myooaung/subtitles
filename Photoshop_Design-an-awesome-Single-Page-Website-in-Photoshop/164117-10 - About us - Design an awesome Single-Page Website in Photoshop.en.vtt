00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.580
In this video,

00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:04.190
we will design the about US section.

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:07.960
So let's see the airframe.

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:14.410
It's an image and then takes on the right side,

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:15.800
have been weak.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.300
That will be our about section.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.000
Create a new layer,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:30.960
I mean in your group and then click and then name it about us and they're using your number

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:30.960
.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:42.460
And there and then find the black Post title drug it one holding key and then move the

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:55.100
layer up about that group and then backs peace to apply the color off the foreground,

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:00.800
then exchanged the name that I don't do about us,

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:19.620
right and C bring back the rights of the groups and using your keyboard arrow up.

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:20.490
Move it.

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:28.650
Then let's make a box.

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:34.590
It's type 100 70 pixels,

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.390
and for the hype around eight pixels,

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.350
this will be our base for our image.

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:49.830
Let's put the ground.

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:51.760
Let's make it rounded Dungan.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:57.600
So enter the to make it around in.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:07.500
Let's position our can get nicely Keyboard arrow,

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:18.660
and then it's dragon in each and wrap it here and thanks to you,

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:24.050
make sure it will be our ship and hit.

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:36.240
Enter and clip it our beast and position nicely and then make a duplicate of our base.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:41.610
Get up and I'm of the cooler.

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.570
And at the stroke,

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:57.390
order off white pixels and control T and and then shift key,

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.230
then drug inside.

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:01.510
All right.

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:15.020
Next we'll do the type a click and making cupcakes.

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:20.920
Goto type in peace.

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:21.870
Nor in Epsom.

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:32.630
Let's remove the upper part of Epsom and don't know that starting picks changing the corner

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.940
something gree.

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:52.690
And let's divide this and it's divided,

00:03:52.690 --> 00:04:08.490
photographed into toe and making this capital letter m All right,

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:12.880
and then it's got the sentence here.

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.330
Make it period and then hit.

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:24.110
Enter Control late to sell a call extension the night to 39 points.

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:42.640
I will make this stores in both capital and make them video in Feinstein darker like okay

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.880
and District Committee takes.

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:49.500
And that's our text.

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.850
Let's zoom out to see it clearly.

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:58.760
Let's see if we can end it something here now that looks fine.

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:04.050
Now let's grow the image in the base ship.

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:12.990
I think the this shape the upper part and in the base in the media.

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:27.820
That is the image group that on the group name about us and also the about us and they say

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:30.520
our my frame in the next video,

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:31.780
we'll do the location.

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:35.330
I hope you enjoy this video on See you next time.
