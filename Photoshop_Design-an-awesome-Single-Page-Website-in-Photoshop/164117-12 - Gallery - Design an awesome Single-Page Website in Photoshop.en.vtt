00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.450
Let's continue designing our single page inside and now gunnery section of our design,

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.930
creating new group and name it gallery.

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:25.530
Make sure you turned on the guides and its drug making,

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:47.400

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.990
number and next.

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:53.340
This name it first,

00:00:53.340 --> 00:01:04.570
and the next thing we need to do is tow.

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.950
Create a base ship for our images.

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.910
Rectangle with 320 pixels and for height,

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:15.760
320 pixels as well.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.790
Get the most,

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:24.660
and it's position it close to the edge of our canvas.

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.480
Let's more video a little bit using your keyboard,

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.180

and what's he showing it when done,

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.640
that's hoping any new image and clip it to our canvas.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:13.090
I mean to our make sure you over the square rectangle and in the middle of two players on

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:20.840
the monkey on next Group E because we're going to duplicate it,

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:26.130
alky again and drug for the right now.

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:27.430
Next position it.

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:44.110
Make sure that there's no space is changing the image and hop in this canvas the same

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.480
process for all the the meaning.

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.540
Even just here on our gallery,

00:02:50.540 --> 00:03:05.690
I duplicated the two groups.

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.950
So is easy.

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:14.920
Then control.

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:27.730
Click in that layer in the images so it directly select the images again,

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.550
our base shape.

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:47.300
And this will be the over area off our gallery in case we put our point there.

00:03:47.300 --> 00:04:06.660
Here is a lot like and never done Your pathetic to 77% are even 72 get your pointer icon

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:11.120
and put it over on our Dungan,

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.610

and this is our final image image for our gallery.

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:24.040
It's basically pretty simple and easy to do close the groups,

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:27.990
so we have a nice and organized layers.

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:36.260
