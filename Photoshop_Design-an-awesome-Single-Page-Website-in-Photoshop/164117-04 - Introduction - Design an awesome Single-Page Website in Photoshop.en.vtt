hello and welcome many Mr Stony.

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:15.610
And in this video you will learn how to design a single page website in October 40 shop.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:22.510
So you can use any other Bayport ship this force despite RC six and is not the thing that

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:23.190
we're going to do.

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:25.960
The middle section,

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.790
the black section thes air very easy.

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:35.260
And you can follow along with me if you want Toe Fargo,

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:40.620
you can just post the video and the thing that we're going to do.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.570
Yes,

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.010
very easy.

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.710
Good for beginners.

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.390
And the type of website is fixed.

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:52.810
Header.

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:57.660
I haven't show you some websites using a fix header.

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.450
And this one If you scroll down,

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:02.700
you can see the header.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.790
It stays there.

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:10.580
And every time you're going toe scroll down the header of Ian.

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:11.270
Stay on.

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:21.510
That's basically and you can click one they want It's ah good example Off single page

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:22.560

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:07.800
Okay.

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.170
And for the icons,

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:15.300

You can actually just like the name and search this data When you click one,

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.530
it will go to your my guns.

00:04:53.530 --> 00:05:01.780
No,

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:02.460

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:12.140
So just click this plus icon and it will out there and you can choose the categories There

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:25.020

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:42.650
down that BNG fighter slickness and now you condone it Unit to give some attribution Now I

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:48.500
see her all right.

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:52.340
Before we start designing this webpage,

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:56.010
let me show you first the anatomy of a website.

00:05:56.010 --> 00:06:03.670
So you will have an idea what I'm talking about when they say heather or hero are anything

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:04.820
that arrogated to him.

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:08.050
So first we start with a header.

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:09.190
If the header.

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:13.110
You will see there the no go in the navigation.

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:18.070
Some people call the menu Are,

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:18.430
you know,

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:22.290
bar and you will see the links here.

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:30.570
Thanks for different different pages or different sections off the beach.

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:31.900
Like Like what?

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:36.610
We're going to do a single beach and the next is hero area.

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:38.890
They call it hero area.

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:41.370
Sometimes pictures lighter.

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:49.450
That's corny hero area for now and the next for hero Theseus,

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:52.950
the content Area or the body from Lepage.

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:55.290
This is the area where you want toe.

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:57.920
Put all the information for your website,

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:03.630
and that's basically the body and the sidebar is optional.

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:08.730
If you have a website that so many things,

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:12.140
then you may want to put the cyber.

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:13.340
But it's an option.

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:14.240
I don't know.

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:21.010
You don't want toe put the sidebar if you have a short website and not so many information

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:21.010
,

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:24.960
and the last one is the floater in Footer,

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:31.020
they put the are the quick links also the social media vehicles.

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:38.810
And sometimes I put the novel off a company that's basically the folder in other website

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:43.150
you would see some has newsletter sign up,

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:48.630
so that's medically delay Further This is the basic requirement of a website.

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:49.950
You have the heather,

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:52.300
the hero area,

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:54.900
the content area and the floater.

00:07:54.900 --> 00:08:01.730
Always remind yourself that when you're designing a website with finish your design with

00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:02.610
all right.
