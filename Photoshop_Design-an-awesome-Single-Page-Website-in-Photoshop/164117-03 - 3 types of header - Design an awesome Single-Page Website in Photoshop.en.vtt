00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.230
In this video,

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:06.770
we will continue our study of types of heather stony the greater discuss.

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:08.680
That's video.

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:10.540
We talked about the fixed and center.

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:14.540
And so today we discuss another three left,

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:16.250
right and split tenders.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:24.810
So let's start with left when the website puts its no go to the next site.

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.290
And under the logo is the navigation that this left header.

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:31.800
Sometimes you see search button on the right side,

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:32.890
like one hour layover.

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.160
Not always a search bar,

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:48.280
sometimes a contact info here on my own projects where I used left Header In this design,

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.090
contact information is in the search box.

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.560
Another example from on the same.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:01:05.530
And see if Heather inaction is such that got on the right side.

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.660
They used such next for me for me.

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:15.090
Call you that on the left head of sight.

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.250
Public class.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.360
Okay,

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.330
next on the happy.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.290
He's right,

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:22.720
Heather.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:30.260
This one logo is on the right side.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.770
You rarely see a website using this back.

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:33.350
Heather,

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.530
I think I did this type of the other ones.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.450
Regressive line that is so that's not good.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:56.270
Let's see some real live examples Knicks and find an example.

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:02.110
Is that and for our less type of weather is split.

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:02.570
Either.

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.680
This type of heather is also popular.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.130
These days I've seen another Web pages using.

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.340
The reason for that is simple because everything looks balance and equal.

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.320
It's my own design I did for applying the local centered.

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.780
And the navigation is it's worth well,

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:27.800
if you have a few minutes turnings for our first example into Joy directed that next is

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:28.320
panics,

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:33.190
ups that price.

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.090
So using speak tender is then he will develop for death,

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:46.770
interacting that are so using this type of heather and find any V of the local website.

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.460
That's a lot for our examples,

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:57.220
in case you have a tragic in the future that on a few things by using big together if my

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.740
world fell,

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.970
I hope you learned something.

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:00.950
See you next time.
