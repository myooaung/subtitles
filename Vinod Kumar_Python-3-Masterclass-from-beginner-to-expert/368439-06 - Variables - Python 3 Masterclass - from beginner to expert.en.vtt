00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.850
a variable in Brighton represent value available by itself,

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:08.260
doesn't have a data type.

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:11.160
But when you has any value to a variable,

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.200
the variable bottles,

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.890
it's day today,

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:14.700
if available,

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.460
has not Bean assigned.

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.280
It has never been created.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.560
And if you're trading access that it's going to give an editor,

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:22.420
for example,

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:25.210
I just open a new fight on shell,

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.020
and then if it like end one,

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.270
which has no value because I never created this,

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.250
it will given other called name better name.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:35.940
Anyone has not been defined.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.930
The way you can define them is by assigning a value.

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:40.950
For example,

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.050
I can stay in one equals two in courts,

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:44.690
on giving me.

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.980
No,

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.650
I can as well use a double court.

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:48.970
They're interchangeable.

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.610
We'll discuss this in strings later.

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.320
But now that anyone exists,

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.480
I can bring what is there in anyone.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.060
I can use that Witten expression also,

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.860
for example,

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.950
I can say and one equals toe anyone.

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:04.700
Plus,

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.060
come on another agency.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.970
Anyone has been changed Here.

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.710
I used the value off anyone,

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:12.480
which is we note,

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.120
unless adding a new string,

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.350
so making it us,

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.180
we know come on on the right hand side,

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.450
which is then assigned back to anyone.

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:28.510
A value in the variable can also be printed using the print function like this.

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:34.750
You can also print multiple values using the print function like this,

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:40.350
I can say value off anyone he's come out and one notice.

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.530
The print is given to one news here.

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.060
So the 1st 20 there are accorded text for a next year.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.530
And then there is an end.

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.600
One Chris Ender.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.790
You can see it has value and monies we know.

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:53.210
Come on.

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:59.200
I can also accept the value from the user by using the input command,

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.160
for example,

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.850
I can take anyone equals toe input.

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.660
I can say in me.

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.110
So here it says,

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:09.030
And their name,

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.280
I can type here.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:10.950
Come on,

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.270
Endo.

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.150
You can see that it just came to the command front.

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.950
But if it like in one now you can see it is Come on.

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.810
Our I can use the previous command that it said value of anyone used.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:30.550
Come on at this point in time and one breakfast when esta so I can type your tight and one

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.150
to find out the same.

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:38.920
I can also play the I R N one to say What are the attributes off anyone now?

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:47.330
Anyone is not a little tight What anyone is an str So this the same as D a r str And these

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:54.670
are the attributes off str which means if they are functions I can use anyone to call them

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.610
For example I can check here Yes,

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:05.800
in one dot is lower and then press enter You can see it is true I can also say anyone dot

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:11.430
upward And then I should see that it should give me an uppercase washing off the same

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.150
depending on what kind of data that anyone refers to.

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.860
Each of these functions will really.

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.230
For example,

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:26.030
if I live in one equals to 100 now if I take in Norn dark is lower you can see it gives me

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:33.900
an editor called attribute better because it does not have these lower the moment areas 800

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:40.430
toe anyone yen one has no longer access toe these attributes off str because it is no

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:46.110
longer than str Now it has access to a different set of attributes To find out the same,

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:51.500
you can take the area anyone and you can see that it has attributes called Big Land

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.700
congregate denominator from bites.

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:55.480
I'm Agnew,

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.740
Marie Riel or two bikes,

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:58.380
etcetera.

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.120
Some off this maybe function.

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:06.740
Some of these may be variables you may have to find out by going to their documentation are

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:07.850
asking for help.
