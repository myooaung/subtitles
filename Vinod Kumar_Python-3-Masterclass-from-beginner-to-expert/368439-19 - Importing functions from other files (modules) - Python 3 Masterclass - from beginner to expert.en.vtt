00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
invite on a file with the dot be way extension.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.770
Consisting off functions like these can also be considered as Ahmadu,

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:16.090
and the whole idea off writing functions is those are reusable lines off court,

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:17.180
for example.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.960
Imagine in another program I want to call this particular function.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.910
So do I have to copy and paste this whole stuff inside that program?

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:27.240
The answer is no,

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.220
because in that case,

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.060
then Mueller toe also copy paste this one on in.

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.810
In case if that function mixes of another function,

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:35.780
you might have to do lots of work.

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:36.860
So instead,

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.640
by Ton provides a simpler way off importing these functions in tow.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.360
Another favor.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.410
So for the sake of demonstration,

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:53.240
let's go and create another fighting called the X $12 B Y and then in the extra oil.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.150
I would like to call the Max Days in month function.

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:58.270
So to do that,

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.590
I have to first say from the X 11 import.

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:03.500
And then I say,

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.010
What is that I want to import?

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:11.630
So this time I can say Max days in month notice that we did not use the file name extension

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.790
here it is just the module name,

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.140
which is the X lemon,

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.080
which is nothing but the name of the file without the extension on also notice.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.010
We're not using any texture.

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:25.240
It is just a module name as if it is available.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:31.420
So hence the file name should not contain spaces because we can't use spaces over here.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:32.540
It's just a fine.

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.650
And from this model,

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.140
we want toe import.

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.880
One of the member defined in that and that member happens to be a function,

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.590
but otherwise it can even be a variable.

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:44.210
For example,

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:45.800
if I have a valuable car,

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:52.070
the X equals 2 10 I can even import this X over here.

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.370
I can say that for save this.

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:59.050
Come back over here and then I can say X also as part of that.

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.850
But if I don't have a variable that I would not be ableto do the same thing.

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.160
So I'm gonna get it off that on.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.600
I don't need that x equal student as well.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:13.900
Let's come back here and then save this notice when I execute this extra older people.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.240
This is the only line of execution where we have.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.040
There is no other statements,

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.090
but let's do one thing.

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:27.070
Let's add to print statements one before the import and after the import them in safe print

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:30.060
before importing on,

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.150
then nominal copy basis and then say after importing,

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.230
Save this on and I go back to the command front.

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:45.190
Let's run this by typing by con three x 12 dark people When I pressed Enter,

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.510
you can see it says before importing.

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.360
And then it says in the month.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:55.650
Now the reason why this enter month is coming because the model is being loaded into the

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.450
Veum and when it is being loaded into the memory,

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.790
it is actually executing every line in this particular model.

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.520
Incidentally,

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.940
this is not an executable is just a definition.

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:08.120
It is stored in the memory.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.890
This is also a definition.

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:11.250
These are comments,

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.310
so they're not gonna be affecting the whole.

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.740
Put there is another function definition.

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:17.700
There is another function definition,

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.180
but there is a function,

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.800
call and dysfunction.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:26.280
Call now goes over here and exist in the month and hence we're getting into a month.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.690
So let's I go and give some number,

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.570
say 2000 on a press enter when I pressed Enter,

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:37.750
It is going to do this job Get the max days into this variable print,

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.740
that particular value and then there is nothing else.

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:41.380
Over here,

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.230
there is nothing else after the main function call.

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.290
So it is back over here.

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.160
So this statement is now over,

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.970
and then it's gonna come back and say After importing safer press enter,

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:55.660
it's going to say there are 30 days in the month on here,

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.520
but then it is after importing now up times.

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.490
We don't want the output from the X 11 itself,

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:08.650
but we just want to import dysfunction and then use that in this particular model.

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.070
So village really speaking,

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:12.180
We don't want this particular court.

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:18.040
We want to call the maid only if this is run directly like fight on three years,

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:18.980
11 dopey way.

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:23.280
But if I say e extra older people which is supposed to import,

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.730
I want to just import only the functions and variables,

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:29.190
but not execute that last line off course.

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:33.780
Now the way this can be handled is by using the name off the model.

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.050
For example,

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:42.660
I'm just out here under the rim statement seeing value off double underscore name,

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.760
double underscored ease.

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:45.910
And then I take here.

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:46.970
Double underscore.

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:48.580
Name double underscore.

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:49.220
Now,

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:50.830
if you're wondering what is this?

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.580
This is one of the fight on three different global variable,

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.670
which is the name off.

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:00.110
The model name of the model s security is extra,

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:03.080
so we expect the extra over here.

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.190
So let's save this.

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:06.730
Go to the command front or on the same thing.

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:11.980
You'll see that it can ask the date as I'm going to ask you some random numbers and then

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:14.520
you can see that it is value off.

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:19.540
The name is not the X 12 but it's called me now.

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:24.680
The reason why it's given main is because this is the main model that I'm running,

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.200
not importing.

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:27.260
However,

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.900
if I go on and cut this from here on,

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:36.320
then go to the next lemon and then pasted somewhere here after the main use over to space

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:40.190
to door here one second amble around this program e x 12.

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:44.730
So obviously the name in the model X 12 is called me.

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:46.850
But when I imported from here,

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:49.980
the e x lemon is not the main model here,

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:55.310
So it is just another modern and his name is E x lemon so you can see now when I run this

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:55.700
court.

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:59.050
It says that let's say one and 2000.

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:00.540
So don't worry about the numbers here,

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:05.970
but look at the value off the name and it says here the value of double underscore name or

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:08.830
you can say it under name is E X 11.

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:13.380
So if you run that the X 11 directly interrupt the extra well,

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:17.850
you can see that it's gonna ask the same thing in the month.

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:19.190
Save you some numbers,

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:20.580
but this time you can see it,

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:21.210
says May.

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:25.280
And that's because E X 11 is the main model that I'm running.

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:28.030
So if you import the excrement,

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:30.040
then it's name is called X Lemon.

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:32.760
What if you run the program E X 11?

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:37.570
Then it's name is for me so we can use this concept and then say,

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:37.910
Hey,

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:40.650
if the name is main,

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:42.910
then you you call the main function.

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:44.070
Others don't talk.

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:46.130
So what we do is let's get off this one,

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:47.940
and then our if statement,

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:49.870
if you double underscored me,

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:53.360
is equals to double underscore Main.

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:55.680
That's the name given if you run this directly,

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:56.500
they may say,

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:56.640
Hey,

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:58.200
call this main function.

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:02.570
So which means if you run this e x 11 directly,

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:05.790
you can see that the main function is being called.

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:07.090
So I give some value.

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:08.570
You can see we got the output.

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:13.940
But if I run the DX 12 this time e x 12 gets the name main,

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:19.370
not the X 11 so you can see that there is before importing after importing.

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:22.360
That means it has run this particular line.

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:22.900
Of course,

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:25.020
it has run this line also,

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:30.630
but it did not execute the main because this time the name is E X 11 not may.

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:32.420
So this whole thing is kept,

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:35.030
but all the models have been imported over here.

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:37.510
But of course I'm only interested in dysfunction.

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:40.090
And now I'm gonna get it off these statements.

00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:47.360
Let's accept a month and a year from the user are I can probably directly type your if

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:51.110
Dunder name equals toe under me.

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:53.550
Then do this particular job.

00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:57.350
Let's call the main function now the main function we don't have here.

00:07:57.350 --> 00:08:01.440
Let's define a new main function over here and then in this main,

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:03.180
we want to do whatever we want to do.

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:04.130
For example,

00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:12.500
I can simply say this equals toe Max Diskin Month off Let's four and 2000 and then I want

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:14.570
to just read here that really,

00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:20.020
if you 2000 there are,

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:20.940
for example,

00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:25.990
for 70 days and then I think this a percent on Denard cities saved this.

00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:31.890
Now run this 12 1 You can see that is going to say in April Total under 30 days,

00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:37.570
and that's because this time it imported this model without having to execute the main

00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:37.960
function.

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:39.060
However,

00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:43.830
the same court here is now executed because when around the G XT well,

00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:49.430
it's name is called me when a import ex love in the name is called E X 11.

00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:51.630
So by comparing this,

00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:54.030
if Dunder name equals to tender mean,

00:08:54.030 --> 00:09:01.580
we will be able tow run a main function once again just to remind the main function itself

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:02.710
is optional,

00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:07.360
but it's just a habit that we are coming from C C plus Pacho RC shop,

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:10.920
so we generally tend to use the function main as an entry point,

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:12.300
and then we say,

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:14.240
if the name meaning,

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:17.190
if the current model is the one that you're running,

00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:22.380
then call the main function and this is how you write the main function and call that in

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:22.830
