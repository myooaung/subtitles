00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.970
now that we have got a fair idea off water spite on and how do we use the bite on rappel?

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:08.800
Let's have a look in tow.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.920
How to be Right by done scripts,

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.150
which are nothing but white on programs stored in a file and execute the same thing.

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:17.320
Obviously,

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.150
we have to take the court in some editors.

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.690
There are many editors that are available specifically meant for bite on,

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:26.990
such as by charm recorded as I.

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.290
D.

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.510
E.

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.680
R integrated development environment.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.180
But for the sake of simplicity,

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:37.640
I'm gonna use a very popular extra leader called Visual Studio Core.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.400
And this is from Microsoft.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.150
It is free and open source.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.850
You can download it on install the same.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:44.950
In my case,

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:46.250
I already got this.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:47.480
Once again,

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.000
you can use any other extra litres.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.680
For example,

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.440
if you're using Microsoft Windows,

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.450
you can use note pad or nor pad plus plus whichever is 10 million for you.

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.300
We will be using this editor only for typing the court,

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.750
but for executing,

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.350
we will still execute that from the command front.

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:13.660
So let me open Visual Studio Court and it comes with this welcome dialogue box and get your

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.060
opening it for the first time.

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.570
You also have an option here called Open Folder that's coming from this file's icon on

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:21.920
Explorer icon.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.230
When you click on that,

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:26.450
if you associate a folder with your region studio,

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:33.210
so I'm gonna go to my desktop and create a folder for despite on demonstrations,

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:41.650
some will create a new folder called Us White on examples and then say Open now I'll be

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:44.480
able to create new files from here.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:48.070
Let's say we clear if I called EG 1.3 white.

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:54.940
The file extension dot p y is optional part with this kind of editors,

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:00.540
because the extension is not the way we will be getting some kind of intelligence over here

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.540
.

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.480
So let's roll a script that accepts a name from the user on.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.620
Then this place a greeting message for this.

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:15.610
I can say name equals toe input and then I can say Enter your name and then at the end,

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.410
I can press enter Now I want to print in a message something like,

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.820
Hello,

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.150
We know how are you today?

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.600
So to do that,

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:31.470
I can save print and then I take your hello And now I need to include the name I can put it

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.470
.

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.030
Come on here and then say name.

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.960
And then I can put another string and then say,

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.400
How are you today?

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.370
So this file is now really for execution?

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:44.520
I saved this.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.970
Now I have to go back to a command prompt.

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.290
So I open in your command,

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.750
prompt.

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:54.400
Make sure that I have to get into my folder where I kept this,

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.020
remember?

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:00.770
Cleared that in my desktop start goto Syria that stop right on Examples.

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.100
You can see that I have this file called.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.310
He exited one dark people now to run the same.

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.590
I have toe just type i country,

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:16.610
followed by AEG 01 dot p y I can press enter and it will ask you enter your name so the

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:18.780
court is being interpreted now.

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.520
So the line number one says input.

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.560
Enter your name so I'll enter.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.790
We note on press enter when I pressed Enter.

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.980
It's gonna continue with the second line on the second line says print.

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:31.610
Hello.

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:32.260
Name?

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.510
How are you today and name will now have this we note.

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:36.800
So it's gonna say hello.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.280
We know how are you today.

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.250
Let's go back to the court and do some more work over here,

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.170
as you can see that I've given here Hello,

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:46.680
a comma,

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.750
Another expression on another string here.

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.950
So there are three parameters I supply to this brain function.

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:58.330
This means that I can supply as many parameters as I want for the print function.

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:02.750
Now suppose I don't want this court to be executed.

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:04.820
I want to write one more print statement,

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:06.560
but I don't want to delete this either,

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.300
because I want to use it at the reference.

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:14.190
What we can do is we can start this line with a hash symbol or pound symbol,

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:18.890
and the deadline is now called comment or a court comment,

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:21.550
which means the interpreter will skip this one.

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:23.310
Using this text editor,

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:28.740
you can use a control slash on Windows Command slash on back toe toggle.

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.650
Between this comment now,

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:31.120
I pressed.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.630
Enter.

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:34.480
I want to type the print message in a different way.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:38.050
The credit can be used with something like this.

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.820
Hello.

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.130
Percentage s.

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:43.050
And then I can say How are you today?

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:47.880
So as you can see that I'm using a special character here percentage s,

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.380
which is called format.

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:57.160
Specify here on this print function can replace these percentage symbols are percentage s

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:57.530
former.

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:01.910
Specify ears with whatever that I give here and the way you can give it.

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:04.060
You're really one personally simple on.

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:09.500
Then what is the variable That you want a substitute over there So I can say your name

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:13.350
because name is the one that convinced the user input data.

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:18.650
So whatever this percentage s is there that will now be replaced with this name.

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:20.750
So I'm gonna save this.

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:22.420
Go back to the command front,

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:25.870
type the theme coming once again quite on three egg.

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:30.560
Zero Wonder people I press enter is gonna ask me what's the name on this time?

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.010
You can see it's going to say hello,

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:32.370
you know,

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:34.040
with that comma and then says,

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:34.890
How are you today?

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:36.210
Let's go back to the court,

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:37.450
do some more.

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:43.060
Suppose I have to accept Enter your city along with the name.

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:44.640
So I'm gonna come back here and say,

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:49.350
city equals toe input and your city,

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:50.600
Andi.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.680
Now I'm accepting to wells from the user.

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.780
Obviously I want to print or make use off.

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:59.100
What name and city in my message.

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:00.620
So I'm gonna comment this out.

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:01.420
And this time,

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:03.450
only print something like this.

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:06.080
Hello Percentage s,

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:07.350
which is for me.

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:12.690
I can say how is the weather in your city,

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:14.490
which is another percentages.

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:14.720
Now,

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:15.050
You see,

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:17.310
I have 2% as symbols here,

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:19.980
which means I have to supply too well use.

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:23.290
And if you simply your name come on City like this,

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:25.170
you may run into editors.

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:26.640
Let's go and check this out.

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:29.450
I go back to the command front around the same command.

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:32.920
Once again it says watchers name I'd say You know what?

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:33.590
Your city,

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:34.610
Bangalore.

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:36.800
And now you can see we garden editor.

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.890
It is not enough argument for the format string.

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:45.340
So it assumes that you're supplied only one because it will take only up to here.

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:47.760
And then it will assume that is totally different.

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:53.370
Expression that you want to print on you have to do is to group them together by using a

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:54.070
bracket.

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:56.390
Another problem is salt.

00:06:56.390 --> 00:07:02.950
So now the endowed string here will now be substituted with this name and city.

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:04.890
Wherever percentage s is there,

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:06.160
I saved this.

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:11.780
Go back and then run the court once again I'll say my name is we know on my city is

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:15.270
strangled Press enter and considers Hello vino house.

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:21.440
Whether in Bangla there is also another way off printing for murder text on this time with

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:26.850
the help off a function in the string class on the str Class.

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:35.000
And the way we can do that is by going on printing here a string Hello and then a pair of

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.040
curly brackets.

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:41.730
And then they How is whether in another curly bracket,

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:45.540
probably a question mark just for the sake of printing question mark.

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:51.920
But these two curly brackets have to be substituted with name and city This being a string

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:54.030
object or in str object,

00:07:54.030 --> 00:08:00.440
the object can be used with a function part format which takes the values for this format

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:04.390
specifies which apparently records so I can see your name Come on,

00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:04.910
city.

00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:06.050
So once again,

00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:13.210
this time we are using a function off the string which is format which takes the perimeters

00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:19.220
given here on will substitute in this curly bracket and then returns and new string.

00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:19.810
So,

00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:20.410
for example,

00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:26.850
I can take this and then I say msg where MSG equals toe end their expression.

00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:27.800
So basically,

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:33.240
we have a string object or here on the string up didn't dot format We're calling The former

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:39.130
will take these two variables name and city and substitutes in days and then returns the

00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:44.130
ender formatted text and the former text is what we're actually trying to print in the line

00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:46.190
Number eight Let me say this.

00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:48.600
Go back to the command line.

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:52.170
Do you have this year and then on the command once again,

00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:52.870
it says,

00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:53.710
Enter your name.

00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:56.300
I say we know End of your city.

00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:57.060
I say bangle.

00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:57.350
Oh,

00:08:57.350 --> 00:08:59.660
I still get the same effect.

00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:00.140
Hello.

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:01.740
We know how is whether in Bangor.

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:08.780
So this is how you create a script file and then executive that so essentially a script

00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:11.690
file consists off multiple lines off,

00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:16.480
bite on core and then you execute our interpret one by one.

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:19.740
So the interpretation always start from line number one.

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:22.410
Line number two these are called commenced.

00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:25.410
Their ignored by the interpreter on Then.

00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:29.460
Then you have the line number three and then lie number four on Gwen.

00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:31.490
There is no more lines to execute.

00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:35.250
The script has been executed completely are successfully
