00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.570
operator or loading means giving extended meaning beyond their pre different operation.

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.950
Meaning,

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:07.060
for example,

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:15.200
the operative plus is used for adding to indigenous as a less joint two strings our March 2

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.810
lists.

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:22.400
It is possible because the plus operator has been already by the end s year on list classes

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.400
,

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.800
you might have noticed that the same building operator or function,

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.350
shows different behavior for objects off different classes.

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:31.650
This is called operator overloading.

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.590
To understand the same,

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:35.820
let's create a new by transcript.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.550
Created a new class on check out some scenarios.

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.060
So I'm appeared e x 23 dot right.

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:49.310
And then a class called Employees were defined The constructor,

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:51.550
which is standard in it.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:57.730
We'll take self Andi kw ARBs so that we can person some values.

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:03.690
Let's assume that the employee has i d name and salary so we can say you're self taught.

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:04.640
Double underscore.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:12.260
Ivy equals toa que lovely art dot get ivy so that in getting the idea is not supplied.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:18.790
It's gonna be a similarly against self dot doubling the score me equals Tok WR start,

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:20.350
get off Name.

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:21.010
Oh,

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.820
no cell door double in the score.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:31.830
Salary equals to locate of Newark's Don't get So that's also define the str function like

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:32.300
this,

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.180
which is a turned admitted,

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.880
which takes self as an argument on returns.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.660
A string washing off this employee information.

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.020
So we're gonna say return.

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.590
Probably say I d records to a current bracket.

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:52.550
Name equals to recovery bracket and salary equals toe a curly racket dot form it and we

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:56.480
supply three perimeters because we have our triggering purpose.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:57.440
Self taught.

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:03.860
Double underscore Ivy Self Start doubling the score name and self dot doubler the school

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:04.630
salary.

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.380
Now that we have this,

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:12.830
let's also define the center and get her for all the three private variables So I can see

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.910
here Death Idee,

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.080
which takes a self as a perimeter.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.470
Andi returns self dot dunder idee.

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.730
But in order to make this a property,

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:30.620
I have to say here at property and to write the center for the same year to say at Heidi

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:37.080
dot center and then say death Ivy self and it takes and I d Here is where we may have toe

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.650
assigned the value that we receive us the perimeter toe the private variable that we have

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.930
in case if you want to do some valuations such as,

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:45.550
for example,

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:46.840
I really must be passed.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.250
Idea Must be an int.

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.840
I didn't.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.070
Must be a number that is greater than zero.

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:53.630
You can do all those things here.

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:58.480
So I'm gonna check your if type off idly is not an image,

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:04.120
then I can raise it an error so I can say here raise because you give a wrong type off.

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:10.800
I recycle safe type A built in other class with a message in village for 80.

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:11.490
Similarly,

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:15.570
I can answer check if I d happens to be a number,

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:21.750
but it's less than or equal to zero Then I can also give another error message saying that

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.380
Glad you better because they said it's an invalid values I can say.

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:27.230
For example,

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.260
I d must be more than zero.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:37.580
If everything is OK then I can probably say you're self taught under I d equals toe I d.

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.250
Since these are one liners,

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.290
let me just cured in the same line.

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.350
So we have a center for i d.

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:48.480
Which receives an I d on d then those couple of validation.

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.120
And if validation is OK,

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.400
then we're passing otherwise we're raising errors.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.550
No.

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:57.850
Notice that this valuation takes place only when you're assigning an I d using an object.

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:58.890
However,

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:59.850
in the constructor.

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:01.210
If I d is given,

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:02.910
then there is a problem.

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.960
So what we're gonna do is the value that we're driving from the capably arson stuff,

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:13.660
assigning directly to the private member variable we can assign to this property directly.

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.990
So because this literal properties off the employees class,

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:22.400
so the self don't idea also can be directly called like this.

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:29.360
So now we're assigning this to a property and that the center is automatically in OECD And

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.730
whatever the value that I'm supplying over here,

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:36.070
that is being received as a perimeter and then we're doing the validation.

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:37.100
If everything is OK,

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.010
then we're assigning self dark.

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.690
Double underscore,

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:40.060
Eddie,

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.250
which we were doing it earlier here.

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:43.440
Now the same thing.

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:44.750
I'm gonna do it for this,

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.690
but this time I don't have a property corn name on salary.

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:51.150
We're gonna do the same thing in a minute.

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.260
So let's come down here and right.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:54.470
The property called.

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:59.850
I mean the death name off cell return,

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:04.090
self dot Dunder name at named or center,

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:10.970
and then a function called the name which receives self on a perimeter so that I'll call it

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:16.160
does name And this name is nothing but the one that were retrieved from the capably arts,

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.710
which is passed during the construction of the object.

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:21.270
Now I can do some validation.

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:21.900
For example,

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:29.650
I can say you're if Dave off name is not str that I can say raise.

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:38.430
They have probably the same messages are we are invalid type for name must be an str and so

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:40.550
on and so foot similarly,

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:46.010
imagine you're given an empty string or a name which is less than two letters or name

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:47.810
greater than 25 characters,

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:49.930
so you can probably throw on other as well.

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:57.290
So I can say if Len Off name is less than R equals to two,

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:59.750
then I'm not interested in the name.

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:04.050
You can also say all if then off name is greater than,

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:04.340
say,

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:05.200
for example,

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:06.000
25.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:13.640
Then I can say raise probably an error like evaluated in this case Onda product and say

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:21.010
that name to launch are too big and that could be one type of editor.

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:25.860
You can think of any other possible validation arrest that you want to give it for name.

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:28.230
You can give them if everything is okay.

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:33.590
I'm gonna say yourself dot Double underscored name equals to name if double underscore.

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:35.530
Name is not there yet,

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:37.800
so that gets created over here.

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:38.940
But if it's there already,

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:39.900
it gets overturned.

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:41.550
Now that we have this,

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:42.380
let's do one more.

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:44.750
So I'm going to say your act property.

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:46.040
Yeah.

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:48.910
Salary Onda,

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:53.820
We received this cell written self dot under salary.

00:06:53.820 --> 00:07:02.080
Now another one is the at salary dot center and then we give your death salary which

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:05.760
receives self on salary and then just ender,

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:08.880
we're gonna copy paste the same thing here.

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:10.670
Andi based over here,

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:13.620
we're gonna take your salary.

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:16.410
That is invalid type for salary.

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:21.370
But this time I also may have a in a zealous float,

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:24.000
so I can say not in.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.920
Then I can say your load off.

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:31.640
And this is because salary maybe a floating by number as well.

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:32.930
Similarly,

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:37.010
I take you give salary is less than letter.

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:37.960
For example,

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:38.950
20,000.

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:44.390
Then I can say that if it is less than or equal to tornadoes and so I want to give another

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:50.470
because it has to be more than or equal to 20,000 so I can give the same message over here

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:50.470
.

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:53.330
And if everything is OK,

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:58.700
I repeated a new property called Salary and pass Under receive value from here.

00:07:58.700 --> 00:07:59.340
Of course,

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:03.390
you could also give a default off something like this if you're not given that.

00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:04.000
For example,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.820
25,000 is the default value for salary here.

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:10.500
So now that we have a basic class here,

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:13.560
let's give it a try regarding the operator overloading.

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:14.480
It's under threat.

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:17.260
The death mean to test out these things.

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:23.140
Let me create toe employee objects so I can say here even equals toe employees off.

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:30.850
Let's give a couple of values Name equals toe Ramage on then I d equals toe one salary

00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:32.080
equals two letter.

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:32.930
For example,

00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:35.540
35,000 Onda.

00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:36.250
Similarly,

00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:40.310
2nd 1 B two b J I ve se,

00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:43.480
for example 12 salary equals toe incurred.

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:50.230
If it passed less than 20,000 you will see that it will raise an error for days.

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:57.350
Let's give it a try on then I tape your if dunder name equals two under me,

00:08:57.350 --> 00:08:59.990
then we want to call the main method.

00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:03.210
Let's go to the command front on check out the same noticed.

00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:05.000
I'm already in my work folder.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:05.960
I have to say here,

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:10.380
fighting three on he externally $3 B y.

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:13.500
And then when I pressed Enter I see another.

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:16.360
The other says I d must be more than 20,000.

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:17.390
So they're the type of here.

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:18.450
It must be salary.

00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:20.320
Let's go fix that on here.

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:20.900
Is that so?

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:24.550
This is supposed to be salary must be more than 20,000.

00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:26.080
Let's go try that again.

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:26.280
I'm,

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:26.700
you know,

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:31.910
clear on a run this court again in our salary must be more than 20,000.

00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:35.670
Because I have passed 5000 annual c est actress like this.

00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:37.270
Let's go fix that.

00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:40.300
I'm gonna go here and type 25,000 are.

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:41.920
If I don't pass this,

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:44.380
the salary will be 25,000 anyways.

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:49.510
So if you wanna check so we can always come here and then print both of them I can say

00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:50.570
cream tea one.

00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:50.990
Remember,

00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:56.560
we have the Dunder str being overloaded and I can say a print You too.

00:09:56.560 --> 00:10:00.420
So let's go try to hear the screen and run the same program.

00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:04.270
You'll see that idea is one name is remains salaries 35,000.

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:09.460
But for BJ salary is 25,000 because of the default value on no relegation.

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:10.200
Better now,

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:12.580
let's come to the operator Overloading.

00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:18.100
Let's give it a try here by typing even plus equals toe letter,

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:19.090
for example,

00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:21.400
a space and then say Come on.

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:27.550
What I'm interested in here is that this Kumar should be appended to rummage.

00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:28.340
However,

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:34.030
the plus equals two is a building operator that will now cause a problem because it doesn't

00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:37.650
know how to add an employee object on an str object.

00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:42.030
The classical store operator can only work with operations off the similar types,

00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:45.440
like str next year in and and so on.

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:49.130
But it doesn't know how to work with an employee and commode,

00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:50.020
which is that strengthening?

00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:50.300
Really?

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:51.310
If I say you're he,

00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:52.600
one plants tickles,

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:52.870
too.

00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:53.120
Let's,

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:53.790
for example,

00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:59.390
2500 because this is a number I wanted to be appended to salary.

00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:02.530
Not these are the definition that I have to give as a developer,

00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:06.520
but this would cause a problem safe ago and tried the same thing.

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:12.190
You will see that it gives me an editor unsupported operating types for Plocica's to an

00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:15.570
implying an str because this is an exception.

00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:18.170
This did not go forward if I come in disorder,

00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:21.550
so the next era you will see it says that employ an integer.

00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:24.490
I don't know how to do the Plocica's tow operator with this.

00:11:24.490 --> 00:11:27.170
So what we want to do is we want to know,

00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:33.150
provided that such that if I use this plastic unstow operator with the string as a right

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:33.690
hand side,

00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:39.310
operate and then I want toe act name if the right hand side operation is a number that I

00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:45.430
want that to be added toe the salary by 10 provides few methods called magic methods to do

00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:46.160
the same thing.

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:47.570
Now the Magic Mother,

00:11:47.570 --> 00:11:48.870
corresponding to this plastic,

00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:49.900
wants to a scar,

00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:50.840
I add,

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:56.070
which is a gender function so I can come to my employees class here and then right here,

00:11:56.070 --> 00:12:03.460
a function called Dunder I add on a double underscoring in which takes itself as the

00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:08.750
perimeter ourself here would be the in walking object which happens to be the left turn

00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:10.000
side off the operetta,

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.750
so that happens to be even.

00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:14.950
So even is retired us sell in the first case.

00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:15.750
If I have e two,

00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:17.050
then it would be received.

00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:20.930
The right to enter of this operator will now be received as another variable.

00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:25.850
Let me call it as God do because I'm not sure it's gonna be a string order number.

00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:28.770
So I'll just generally tried this as value.

00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:30.100
Now that I have these two,

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:37.250
I can check if type off value in paint off float is the same number.

00:12:37.250 --> 00:12:38.880
Then I can see yourselves,

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:41.300
which happens to be even at this point in time,

00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:42.640
Don't salary,

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:45.680
which is a property that we have defined right here.

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:47.820
We're gonna assign a value.

00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:51.940
So we're gonna say you're plus equals toe value notice.

00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:52.610
At this time,

00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:54.160
salary happens to be a number.

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:55.780
We have ensured that over here,

00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:57.810
and value is also number.

00:12:57.810 --> 00:13:02.920
We have ensured that over here now there is no problem because number plus equals number is

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:03.730
not a problem.

00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:07.340
So the building operator itself knows how to handle these numbers.

00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:09.900
So this addition takes place.

00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:16.140
But in case if the dive off a new is a str,

00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:22.720
I can check with equal street calls to esta then as their self dot name plus people's to

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:23.410
value.

00:13:23.410 --> 00:13:27.270
We know that this is a str This is an astir property.

00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:29.250
So we are con coordinating now.

00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:35.220
So this way the value will be either appended to the name or added to the salary any other

00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:36.540
data data you supply.

00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:37.200
For example,

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:44.780
if you supply Boolean or any other data type so I can see here else raise probably at a

00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:45.450
type error,

00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:50.190
because I don't know how to handle that over here so I can supply a singular message.

00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:54.850
Invalid type for plus equals two operations.

00:13:54.850 --> 00:14:01.570
One last thing that we have to do for this I add function is to return self at the end so

00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:05.070
that the same thing will be assigned back to this even here.

00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:08.370
So after adding whatever that we are returning here,

00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:11.210
will be assigned back to this even on e too.

00:14:11.210 --> 00:14:13.550
So let's go back to the car in front,

00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:14.720
around the same script,

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:16.760
once again on you'll see.

00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:23.750
This time it has been changed toe Ramesh Kumar as well A salary has been changed to 37,000

00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:24.370
finder.

00:14:24.370 --> 00:14:25.250
Similarly,

00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:28.050
we can overlord a couple of other operators,

00:14:28.050 --> 00:14:29.000
for example,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.950
if even less than e to then I want to compare.

00:14:32.950 --> 00:14:37.440
Employ once a salary with employees to salary are,

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:38.250
if directly,

00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:40.170
If I stopped like some number like this,

00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:45.750
then even salary is compared with the 50,000 that I watched as a perimeter.

00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:47.390
So if I want to do this,

00:14:47.390 --> 00:14:48.360
let's give it a try.

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:51.710
So I'll check here if even less than e too.

00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:53.650
Then I won't say Here print,

00:14:53.650 --> 00:15:02.290
Let's say the imply Once name I'll give you owns more than employees to name and said dot

00:15:02.290 --> 00:15:02.950
format.

00:15:02.950 --> 00:15:03.910
Remember,

00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:05.090
we have the property,

00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:06.800
I can say even got name.

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:11.130
He took dark name So two off the names of printed over here.

00:15:11.130 --> 00:15:11.880
In this case,

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:13.470
because I used a less than operator,

00:15:13.470 --> 00:15:15.750
I should check your less than.

00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:16.820
Similarly,

00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:22.950
I give another one where if I have your something like 50,000 they should be 50,000 years.

00:15:22.950 --> 00:15:23.860
It's an amount.

00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:24.700
Let's go.

00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:25.320
Give it a try.

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:27.110
Both of these are going to give another force.

00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:30.440
This will raise an exception and stop the execution of the program.

00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:31.710
If I come in this out,

00:15:31.710 --> 00:15:32.740
then they should given error.

00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:33.920
So let's give it a try.

00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:38.910
Sore on the court you'll see that it says less than operator is not supported between

00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:41.110
instances off employees and employees.

00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:44.300
If I come into this line and then on the court,

00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:49.800
you will see that it is less than is not supported between employees and not this time.

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:53.490
We're also expecting a bullion as a return by Luthier,

00:15:53.490 --> 00:15:55.140
not the self.

00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:57.520
So in orderto overload,

00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:01.850
the less than operator the magic method here is called Dunder L.

00:16:01.850 --> 00:16:02.410
D.

00:16:02.410 --> 00:16:09.420
So there is also L E and G T G for less than a reconstruct greater than greater because toe

00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:09.920
etcetera,

00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:18.210
Let's come back your death double underscore yell B in this case and say self on a value.

00:16:18.210 --> 00:16:23.820
The value can be an employee object or it could be a number fancier.

00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:29.290
If I'm off value is equals toe employees,

00:16:29.290 --> 00:16:35.050
then we're gonna say return self taught salary.

00:16:35.050 --> 00:16:40.860
Is it less than value start salary because value is an employee object.

00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:42.460
So we checked it out over here.

00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:49.650
And if take off value in either in our float,

00:16:49.650 --> 00:16:53.960
then I want to say return self taught salary.

00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:57.420
Is it less than the value given as a perimeter,

00:16:57.420 --> 00:16:59.800
which is the right time site in both the cases,

00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:01.570
it's going to return true on falls,

00:17:01.570 --> 00:17:07.900
depending on the expression given over here in case of any other direct that you have given

00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:07.900
.

00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:13.530
I'll say your raise type better because maybe you can say unsupported type.

00:17:13.530 --> 00:17:19.400
So it's a unsupported tried for less than operated on employees.

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:21.860
So let's give it a try now.

00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:25.230
So we have given here toe expressions already.

00:17:25.230 --> 00:17:30.880
We know that even salary by no is 37,000 finder he to serve these 25,000.

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:33.450
So this condition is not satisfied.

00:17:33.450 --> 00:17:36.020
So obviously it is not going toe print.

00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:37.190
Dismiss it at all.

00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:41.530
But as even sell these 37,400 less than 50,000.

00:17:41.530 --> 00:17:41.980
It's true.

00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:43.130
So this is going to come.

00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:44.950
So that's gonna try this once more.

00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:49.730
Let me hear the screen and then run the fight on script and you can take this tentative.

00:17:49.730 --> 00:17:56.590
Ramesh Kumar owns less than 50,000 but they didn't say Ramesh More owns less than VJ Now

00:17:56.590 --> 00:18:01.410
what we can do is we can swap this so it's a e two and even here,

00:18:01.410 --> 00:18:02.890
or I could give a salary,

00:18:02.890 --> 00:18:06.500
which is more than 37,400 Let's give it a try.

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:08.560
This time you'll see that it is their mission.

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:10.090
Bar owns less than region.

00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:11.430
That's the wrong message,

00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:11.710
Doe,

00:18:11.710 --> 00:18:14.510
because I'm giving here even name and you to name.

00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:15.510
They should be scrapped,

00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:22.480
ultimately had simply to an undue and then supply a salary which is more than remains the

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:23.220
salary Lexus,

00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:23.830
for example.

00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:24.630
40,000.

00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:26.410
Let's go give it a try again.

00:18:26.410 --> 00:18:32.580
And this time it is Ramesh More owns less than VJ because remains salary is 37 500.

00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:33.640
But as we just help,

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:34.680
it is 40,000.

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:36.070
So in general,

00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:39.560
all the operator or loaded functions would look like this.

00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:45.400
Were you receive a self which is the left hand side off the operator and then you have the

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:50.010
value which is the right hand side off the operator against for the binary operators

00:18:50.010 --> 00:18:51.350
perform some operation,

00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:55.790
return some valleys in case off the relational operators like less than great honor,

00:18:55.790 --> 00:18:56.220
etcetera.

00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:58.180
So you must return a Boolean valley,

00:18:58.180 --> 00:18:59.690
which is what we're doing over here.

00:18:59.690 --> 00:19:06.080
Whereas in case off the I function suggest I had I'm all I sub etcetera.

00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:08.290
You should return the self itself.

00:19:08.290 --> 00:19:11.460
Here are the other operatives that you can overload.

00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:16.670
These are binary operators like plus minor star slash integer division Exeter.

00:19:16.670 --> 00:19:20.180
And these are comparison operators are relational operators.

00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:22.940
All of these mustard written through our funds.

00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:28.140
And then we have your shortened assignment operators like plastic ones to which we start

00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:31.430
just no ar minus equals toe started questo.

00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:32.650
In all these cases,

00:19:32.650 --> 00:19:34.850
you must return self itself.
