00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.460
in this video,

00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:04.980
let's go and understand a better way off opening,

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.260
reading and writing into files.

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:13.930
So I'm gonna create a new five year e x $17 people where I'm going to write a function that

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:20.740
mean and for the time in the past and say if under name equals toe under me,

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:23.030
we're gonna call the main function.

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:25.660
The first thing that we want to do is tow.

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:26.770
Ask the user toe,

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.620
enter a file way we can read the content of the file.

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:37.750
So I find name equals toe input and finally the user enter the file on.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.900
Then we can say you're put one on then the fighting.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.220
So the finally is available.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.860
Finally,

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.600
by default is the read more so I don't mention And then I can assign this to a variable

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.130
called F and somewhere at the end,

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:53.900
I should say f that close.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.240
So the open file is close to in between.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:01.160
I want to do reading off the content on to read the content.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.780
We have three functions.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.470
We have a read which reads the entire content of the fight.

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.460
The second is the Read line,

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.690
which reads one line at a time,

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.750
and the third is read Aligns where I read the ender file.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.060
But I get a list off lines in the fight,

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.850
so we're going to say Here first line equals toe.

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.830
You have thought read line.

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.270
I did one line at a time and then I'm gonna say here while lying,

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.560
not equal.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.000
Stow an empty string.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.780
We want toe proceed for the bracket.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:36.950
Here is optional.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.290
It's just a group.

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:39.930
Multiple conditions if you have.

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.700
I don't have multiple conditions that while line is not an empty string,

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.510
you can say your print line.

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:52.700
And then I say end equals toe an empty string because the lining itself contains the new

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:53.540
line character,

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.130
which is part of the file.

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.090
Once the printing is done,

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.440
I have to say again,

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.010
lining quotes toe f dot the line on.

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.750
Then we're going to read the second line here.

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.550
If there is no second line,

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:07.090
then of course,

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.340
this condition fails and then come out.

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.960
And then I said,

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:10.680
close here,

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.590
but otherwise I'm going toe.

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.160
Repeat the same thing again and again until I reached the end of the file.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:23.870
Let's go and try executing this file so This is e X 17 dark people and saved by country e X

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.190
$17 B one.

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.220
It's gonna ask me the name of the file now,

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:34.770
since I'm in my current project folder or workspace all the fights I have here I can just

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:35.910
start the file name.

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.850
I'm gonna play pure e x $10 b Wife I press enter.

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.850
It's going to leave the continent off the extender p y.

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:44.250
And then it's coming out.

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.320
As you can see the last line somewhere,

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.360
I believe I should have given a new line character it did not print.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.070
So there's some special character here.

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:55.740
You can just come out here and then say your print on then that should take it off the

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.760
output so I can also take the absolute part when I'm typing here.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.560
So let's clear the screen and try running the same thing again.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.600
And this time I'll die.

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.960
Peer slash users slash we know.

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:14.140
Come on slash desktop slash quite on examples slash e x 15 Torpey wine.

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.190
Now you can see when I press enter.

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:21.350
It's giving with a complete content of the file without any extra new lines except the last

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.060
plane because there's a new land I explicitly printed.

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:30.030
So that's going to try another example where I can read using the read lines without having

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.730
to use the loop on.

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:32.400
To do that.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.440
I'm going to create a new file here.

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.180
So I say E x $18 people.

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:38.600
Andi,

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:44.250
I would let to copy the content off 17 completely based here,

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:49.750
but I will get it off this part because I want to do it in a different way this time.

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.990
So I still want to accept the filing from the user.

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:54.970
I have to open the file.

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.680
I have to close it on the way.

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:58.810
I would be interested.

00:03:58.810 --> 00:03:59.260
Story,

00:03:59.260 --> 00:03:59.960
that is,

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:05.350
I can say lines equals toe F start read lines.

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:08.090
Floral Previously used a singular.

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.050
This time the reading happens one time,

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:13.950
but I get on the lines in a list here,

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.390
so the data type of lines is a list,

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:19.430
since the real type of lines is a list.

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.090
Instead of using a wide loop,

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:22.780
I'm going to use a for loop.

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:27.360
So I'll say he had far lying and new reliable in lines.

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.500
And then I can say here,

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.150
print lying.

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:31.050
No,

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.150
no,

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:32.060
one is that again?

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.950
The line contains the Nuland characters.

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:38.020
I don't want to print an additional Nuland character,

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:42.880
so I'm using this nd called Stow and Empty String so that the print itself doesn't add a

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.380
new line character at the end when the file is being closed.

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:49.370
I'm also giving a Nuland character road here.

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.340
Let's go try this.

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:52.240
Agent one,

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.840
I clear the screen once again.

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.690
Like the previous ones I can.

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:03.380
Either The related pot are the absolute pot 11 either e x 18 Darby like itself.

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:08.400
So I'm tryingto run the program and the program ribs itself entrance the same.

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.040
So when I press center,

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.350
you can see regarded.

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:15.000
But only thing is that the reading happened only one time.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.510
Not inside the look.

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:19.160
We still have toe open the file on,

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:20.250
then close the file.

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:21.170
So importantly,

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:23.540
closing off the file is off some concern.

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:24.550
At some point in time,

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:25.140
let's see,

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:26.580
another are unemployed,

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:27.720
is washing off the same.

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:32.580
So I'm gonna do one more thing this times I'm gonna copy this file and then baste it.

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:35.110
It comes as he x 18 copy.

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:37.930
I'm gonna change it to the x 19.

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:40.650
Andi removed all these lines.

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:41.430
Once again,

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:47.570
I have a function that reached the filing from the user opens The five closes the same

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:47.860
thing.

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:51.520
But instead of doing like previously,

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:56.050
I can simply supply here for lying in.

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:00.570
And then I can say f where if itself is the file object.

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:01.540
As you can see,

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:04.030
file object is not in the terrible,

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:05.530
but in this context,

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:07.750
it looks like we are looping over there.

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:12.740
F So the internal mechanism is where when you say line in F,

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:17.420
there'll be something called generators where it's going to give you one line at a time as

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:18.530
you pursued Father.

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:20.440
So we're gonna just print here,

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:25.490
create line on then and equals to an empty string exactly the same thing.

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:29.550
So without having toe call the read read line orderly lines,

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:33.830
I'm able to access the content as if if itself is any terrible.

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:38.600
So that's going try this I type here he x $19 b y,

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:44.960
and I'll type here e X 19 itself so that we can see the content once again and you see it

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:49.650
is able to read the file one line at a time from the file object itself.

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:52.050
Let's go and see one last way off.

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:58.310
Reading the file on the better method to read the file is where the open file should get

00:06:58.310 --> 00:06:59.600
automatically close.

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:00.230
So far,

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:06.770
this bite and provides a block corn as a victor block so the width block automatically

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:08.470
closes whatever is open,

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:09.600
intact the wit block.

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.140
So to do that,

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:12.720
let's go and save this file.

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:18.520
So this time I'm gonna go and safe I'll save us and then I'll that e X training on Enter.

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:24.640
Now there is a new file exact same content the X 20 but I'm gonna remove these things

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:25.670
completely.

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:28.430
I have accepted the filing from the user.

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:30.030
I haven't opened the final.

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:31.760
I haven't read the file at all.

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:39.580
So this is where we say Wait and then type your open finding as some variable called F all

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:40.830
reckon emitters file.

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:46.250
So what it does is it's gonna execute this function on the return value of this function

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:49.400
will be assigned into this variable called five.

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:49.950
Now,

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:52.850
that file is the return of the open.

00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:55.400
This the same as F In our previous examples,

00:07:55.400 --> 00:08:02.460
I can simply type you're far line in a while and then I can print the line without new land

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:03.070
characters.

00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:07.190
So now you can see when I exit the with the block,

00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:09.800
the file gets automatically close.

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.690
So this is called Otto closing.

00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:13.170
So that's going Give it a try.

00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:16.680
Not that the variable file has no scope outside that.

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:18.130
So if I come here and then say,

00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:20.200
Hey is filed closed.

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:23.540
It says file is not different because fine would have been different.

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:27.300
Only insect this particular with the block so many occasions.

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:32.540
Developer for ghetto use the filer clothes are sometimes intentionally they wouldn't have

00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:34.820
anyone not knowing where to close.

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:39.930
So this would be a better choice because the file gets closed once it is out of the school

00:08:39.930 --> 00:08:39.930
.

00:08:39.930 --> 00:08:42.060
So let's go and try this once more.

00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:43.990
So I'm gonna clear the screen and I said,

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:47.340
by country e x 20 dot p y,

00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:49.860
and you would see that it's asking me the name.

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:53.290
I have the same name once again reading the same content,

00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:54.060
and you see,

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:56.970
I'm able to read the file without any problem.

00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:58.850
Now let's take examples toe,

00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:00.060
create new files.

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:07.560
Let me close all these files on the create a new file called E X 21 Turkey White Andi where

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:13.140
I want toe except a bunch off names from the user and then write the content into the file

00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:13.140
.

00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:14.870
So I like your death.

00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:15.230
Me,

00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:18.910
I asked the fighting from the user.

00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:20.940
What is the fighting that the other wants toe?

00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:24.300
Create so and say here in port Ender,

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:28.570
the finding somebody who's a while True,

00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:30.920
which happens to be an endless loop on.

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:34.120
Then I say your name equals toe input.

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:38.150
Enter a name or I can say quit.

00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:39.540
So stop.

00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:46.010
So if the user doesn't want to continue so here she can say Quit on whatever that is enter

00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:53.520
if name equals toe quit then I want toe break the loop here by typing of breaks statement I

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:57.250
can exit the loop because otherwise it is an endless loop.

00:09:57.250 --> 00:09:57.860
Now,

00:09:57.860 --> 00:09:59.770
if name is not equal to quit,

00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:02.540
I want to write this name into the file on.

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:05.600
This is where I should have opened the five year on.

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:06.820
Like the previous case,

00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:12.340
I can still say your wit open off failing as five.

00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:18.360
And now I should invent this with one more time because now it's all inside this with Block

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:18.360
.

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:24.370
So we have the file object here on the file Object provides a function called right and

00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:25.870
then I simply said Name.

00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:26.660
Of course,

00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:29.100
right doesn't add a new line character,

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:32.800
so I might want to add either a new line character.

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:38.360
I can call it us right length now to see if this function exists or not.

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:44.050
You can go to the potential by typing by country something like ethical toe.

00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:45.650
Open a file name,

00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:46.170
Let's say,

00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:47.090
for example,

00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:48.790
egg 01 dirty white.

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:51.080
It doesn't matter that the file exists or not.

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:57.120
I take your gear and you can see that there is a function called right and the right

00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:00.120
through and right Aligns lines is in plural,

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:02.560
so we don't have a function called right line.

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:03.370
A singular.

00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:05.310
We have a function called right,

00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:08.890
so let's go and use here right instead of right line.

00:11:08.890 --> 00:11:11.370
And because there's no Nuland character,

00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:15.150
you take your right on a new and character like this.

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:18.670
So one name is returned and the new lead characters added to that.

00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:22.850
So this continues as long as the user doesn't I quit.

00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:24.490
But if the user types quit,

00:11:24.490 --> 00:11:26.090
then the loop is broken.

00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:31.220
Your outside the loop you will be outside the with block on the fire gets automatically

00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:31.740
close.

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:36.650
So we'll give a feedback message The user saying that the file is now,

00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:37.210
kiddo.

00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:39.820
Another fine limit,

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:40.400
of course,

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:41.410
entered by the user.

00:11:41.410 --> 00:11:43.860
So we can even print What is the name of the fight?

00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:44.730
But that's OK,

00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:52.130
and I'm gonna try pure now If Dunder name equals toe under me will say here called the main

00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:52.550
function.

00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:57.900
So I'm going to go back to the command prompt exit the potential So type here fight on

00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:02.410
three x 21 dot people I it says enter filename.

00:12:02.410 --> 00:12:03.440
I'll take your names,

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:03.780
Doc.

00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:05.830
Txt So we got an editor.

00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:08.920
It says that the fine art phone there are no such file,

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:14.540
our military Now I believe the problem here is when I say open filing I didn't mention the

00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:16.080
more on by before.

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:22.460
The more is the read more so to say here now more equals toe W to say that Hey,

00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:27.030
we're opening in the right more other little assume that you want to open the file for the

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:30.570
read and for reading the files should exist for the right.

00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:32.150
If the file doesn't exist,

00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:34.380
it gets created at this point in time.

00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:36.670
So let me go back to the command front,

00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:40.930
run the command again and this time and say named start txt.

00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:42.010
The file doesn't exist,

00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:45.050
but it gets created this time and it says Enter name.

00:12:45.050 --> 00:12:46.330
So I'm gonna take your name.

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:46.870
We know,

00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:47.900
I know.

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:55.300
Cushy Karishma on sacred When I said quit it said the file is created.

00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:55.490
Now,

00:12:55.490 --> 00:13:01.320
if I go and check what is the final name you consider there is one final called names dot

00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:06.060
txt if I go back to the rear score and if you see that they're the names are PhD.

00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:06.740
Click on that.

00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:10.640
You'll see that on the names exist along with the new line character.

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:13.800
The Nuland corrective is because after writing the name,

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:16.960
I'm actually passing a new land character over here.

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:19.450
So this is how the fire gets created.

00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:23.530
But if I go back and then run the script a game,

00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:25.450
let's try that Once again,

00:13:25.450 --> 00:13:27.060
I'm going to supply the same name.

00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:29.890
Start txt game on a type here,

00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:31.730
John on Jane.

00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:32.630
And then I said,

00:13:32.630 --> 00:13:33.150
Quit.

00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:35.200
Now we see the file is created.

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:38.150
If I go back over here to a lesser price,

00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:43.360
you'll see that the previous names have been deleted on The new names have been upended

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:44.100
over here.

00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:48.820
So the reason for that is the right More also raises everything.

00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:51.420
Whatever exists if you don't want,

00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:52.590
you can always supply.

00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:57.880
They are more as a to say that I want o upend instead off over right.

00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:02.280
So if you see currently names dot txt contains John and gin.

00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:08.630
So let's run this once again on gonna die Pure names dark txt reaches an existing fight,

00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:13.900
but since we use the more as it is not supposed to be overturned but to be appended someone

00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:15.660
deco we not on,

00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:20.420
say a no cushy on Karishma enter.

00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:20.690
And then,

00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:22.160
if they quit safer,

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:26.940
go back here and then check names are txt along with the previous two names.

00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:28.750
The new names have been upended.

00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:29.990
So by default,

00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:33.280
the more for file opening is agreed.

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:33.990
But if you want,

00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:39.930
you can use more equal to W for writing or operating and more nickels to pay for a pending
