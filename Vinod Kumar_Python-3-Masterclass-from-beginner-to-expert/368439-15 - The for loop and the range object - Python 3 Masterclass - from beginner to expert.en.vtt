00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.250
fighting Also support another kind of flu are far loop,

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:08.750
but this is a little bit different than what you find in other programming languages.

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:09.890
To understand this,

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:11.730
let's take an example first.

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.150
So we'll say zero a dark people.

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:22.100
I Let's have you want to use the for loop toe print a bunch off names so I can see here And

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.860
then I can say name in a bunch off names like you know,

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:27.750
Sean,

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.340
that's a John I N G.

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:39.250
So we don't have a loop that actually gives me one single name from this bunch off names

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:40.120
over here.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:47.260
So it's gonna take we know first time and then enters this block where I can say print name

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:47.260
,

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.160
which is actually gonna say print we don't right.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.170
And after this is printed,

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.990
if you don't have any other statement,

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:59.710
it's gonna go back and then assigns this variable name with this value off Sean.

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.660
And then it renders the block print this name on.

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:04.290
Then again,

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.310
it goes forward.

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:07.280
Take the told the name on,

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.450
then the four to me,

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.310
and then when there are no more means to go through further,

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.290
it's just gonna quit the variable name here is totally your choice.

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.360
If you don't want name,

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.290
you can do something else so I can come off this and then they print here.

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:22.850
Say,

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.750
end off the example.

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.360
Save this Go on,

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.700
executive This age one,

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:37.700
I'll say country X 08 Dirty white and you will see that we got 1234 names and then says End

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:38.610
off the example.

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:46.080
Let's say we want to know Looked through a bunch of numbers so I can say here for no in And

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:54.350
then I say 1234567 age nine and 10 And now I can say different.

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:55.580
No.

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.460
So none numb will be taking the first number,

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.500
which is one prince that value.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:07.160
Then you take the 2nd 1 print that value so it repeats or on these entries.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.620
And then,

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:08.080
of course,

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.000
it just stops.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.120
So if I execute this now in see,

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.960
that is going to say first blueprints,

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.650
the names there and then the second loop is printing all the numbers.

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:19.590
However,

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:25.110
if you're wondering what if I want to print all the values from 1 to 500 should I be giving

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.580
one?

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.970
Come on.

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.570
Come on up to 500.

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.130
Now the answer is no.

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.810
This is really bite down.

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.670
Provides an object called the range object.

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.080
So to understand this,

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:42.090
let me show you by going to the fight on to environment now for Windows users,

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.480
you may not have returned to,

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:44.500
but that's okay,

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.670
so I'll show you here on my system.

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:47.560
So when it ate,

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:48.120
bite on,

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:54.220
you can see that I'm in fight on two environment and here is a range object USA,

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.730
range off 10 and press enter.

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.700
You'll see that it shows me a bunch of numbers from 0 to 9.

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.180
But as if I want I can always a range off one.

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.560
Come on,

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.110
10.

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.970
And this time it's gonna show me from one.

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.140
So I'm saying two numbers here,

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.630
which is like the start and the end,

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.570
and not that the end is not included or in the list here.

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:18.250
Right?

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.250
So the ridge also can take,

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:22.170
for example,

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.520
one comma 100 then I can get to hear to say,

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:27.910
skip every two numbers.

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:28.280
So,

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.220
for example,

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.060
after one,

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:37.130
it skips the next number and then jumps off and then gives me three and then it skips that

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.660
basically,

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.790
it's going to step where it is.

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.180
Incriminated by that number that is given,

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.800
for example,

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:47.210
one plus two is 33 plus two is 55 plus 37 and so on and so forth.

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.790
So,

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:48.360
for example,

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:53.890
I can range off 1 200 with five are probably four.

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.320
You can see that it's going to say 159 13.

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.090
It's keeping every four numbers now.

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:08.440
I can also say Range off 0 105 I get multiples off five here.

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:14.780
I used to fight on two because if I fix it despite onto and then get into a fight on three

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.780
,

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.070
do the same thing as a range off one.

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:18.400
Come on.

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.720
10.

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.510
You'll see that it's implicit.

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:21.830
Strange object off one.

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:22.480
Come out then,

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.000
so we will not be knowing what?

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.380
Actually,

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:25.060
it is steak,

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:26.340
but behind the thin,

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.020
it represents a bunch of numbers from 1 to 9.

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:34.390
So now I can use this on Lou over day.

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.580
So,

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:35.100
for example,

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:40.000
the same thing Now I can commend all these and then I can come down and then say,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.690
for number in the range.

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:44.160
Off one toe,

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.980
11 If you want to include 10 then I'll say your print.

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:48.550
Now.

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.290
Save this.

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:51.470
Go back to the command.

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.750
Prompt fight on three e.

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:55.050
Eg 08 door P.

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.370
Wine.

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:56.560
Press enter.

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.540
You can say I get from 1 to 10.

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:04.220
So use the Farlow when you know exactly how many times the reputation should occur.

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:07.360
But if you don't know how many times you should go with that.

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.510
Why Look now in the previous examples,

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:16.230
like where I used of I look over here because I know exactly how many times I should be

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:17.070
doing this.

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:19.140
We should go for a farm now.

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:19.330
Why?

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:23.250
Look should be used when we don't know how many times the look should go.

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:27.190
We will take better examples off the white loop as we go forward.
