00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.030
here is a find that we have called people don't See a Sweet,

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:07.550
which is a comma separated values,

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:11.290
and you can see that the first line here is a header,

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:13.860
which contains idee name email.

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:20.520
Phone City on the second line onwards contain a bunch off comma separated values which

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.590
correspond to the respective headers.

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.580
If you're on Microsoft windows,

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:25.580
if you double click this,

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:26.490
people don't see us.

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.480
We you should open the same thing in Excel on Mac.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.320
I have this liberal office,

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.590
which is in a similar tool for working with these kind off common separated values.

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.910
Let's put all the thing that we have learned together on tryingto can work the CSB file in

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:43.330
tow.

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.520
Jason fight to do the same thing.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:51.270
Let's create a new five year called my you tills dot b y.

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.020
I'm generate more functions as we go forward.

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.550
Andi,

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:56.920
we're gonna use this muting,

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:57.110
sir,

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.710
people in other projects as well.

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:05.480
The first thing that you might want to do here is to write a corps comment are documents

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:12.640
string and then you can do by typing three single courts or three double courts and then

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.400
end the same thing like this and then you can mention here,

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.820
what is the purpose off this particular file,

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.480
which is considered as a document string.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:27.800
So if it all you import this my you tills in tow some potential and then say help on my

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:28.430
youtube's,

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:29.510
you should see this one.

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.590
So that's going to try the same thing we're gonna say here,

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:33.720
my you teams,

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.040
this is basically the filing,

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:44.610
and you can say a set off utility custom functions that can be used by other conscience.

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.530
You can also die pure created by,

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:53.520
and you can give your name on probably email so that this access the documentation.

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.850
So just to show you how this is gonna work So if I go back over toe my command front,

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.520
make sure that you're in the working military,

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:02.660
which is the correct one,

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:03.550
great for me.

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:04.330
And I said,

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:05.350
by country,

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.790
now I can see your import.

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.350
My YouTube's.

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:10.020
Andi,

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.290
I believe the file naming convention is wrong.

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.930
That's going to rename this as my you tills without the hyphen.

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.300
So I'm gonna go back and press enter here on windows,

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:26.030
human say have to and then I'm gonna remove that hyphen making it as my u two's here

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.400
outside.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:32.230
The more that and come back here and now I can say import my you tills what?

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:33.440
It does it It's going toe.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:39.830
Look in the current folder where you have launched a fight on three and then if that exists

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.830
,

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:40.780
it's loaded.

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:41.090
Now,

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.180
if I type your health on my you tills and press enter,

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.790
you'll see that we got name my you tills.

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.130
I believe this is coming because of the very first line.

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:53.880
Then there is a bunch of description,

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.320
which is the second line on words.

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.100
All these are conservatives Description.

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.030
What is the actual file?

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.530
So we have the file in this location currently,

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.430
and if in case there are multiple members off this,

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:07.300
it would have listed.

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.490
So right now I don't have anything here.

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:11.000
So when we write,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.210
more functions will come and have a look at this once again.

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:19.420
So I'm gonna exit from here and come back toe the cold.

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.330
So since this is not required because it's automatically taking this,

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:24.000
let's get it off.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.580
This we just give a description.

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.850
Let's have a function here called CSP to Jason,

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:35.090
which takes a filing as an argument reads the fine converts the content into a Jason

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.650
Continent stores with the similar name.

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.380
So I'm gonna go right here.

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.710
They're CS week toe Jason,

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:45.110
and it takes Find him as a parent of now.

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:47.450
What if the perimeter is missing?

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:53.220
Then I may want to inform you that that file name is mandatory so I can check here if file

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.990
name he calls to you can say Is it none?

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:01.130
All of the user has supplied something other than a stream.

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:02.220
So I can say here,

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.250
type off Filene,

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:05.910
not people's toe.

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:13.230
Str then it can cause an editor by using the key were called race and then an object.

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:20.570
So you might have to create an error object like exception and then say here find name must

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:26.900
be a string so that the other that I want to give to the race key where is equal and off

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.070
causing a problem.

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:31.650
That means that because there is no try except to block here,

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:36.840
dysfunction will be raising an exception to the color off this particular function which

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:41.940
could be a main function in our case and eventually your application is going to be broken

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:41.940
.

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.510
Let's come back So the final aim is proper.

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:52.580
Then we want toe open the file for reading so I can say with open finally But before the

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.210
more Isra as F,

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:58.090
which is the fighting now I have the fight.

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:04.090
I want to read the very first line and then keep it as a header So I can say you're better

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:09.070
equals toe yet Start really line not this read line.

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:11.150
Reach everything in the first line,

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:13.280
including the new land character.

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:19.350
And it can simply call the strip function here toe remove the leading and trailing spaces

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:22.140
and that actually is now my header.

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:29.450
But it can also convert this enter stream in tow list by simply passing the split function

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:32.160
and then say that the comma is the polluter.

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.630
So at this time,

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:39.400
if I want to know what is there in the header so I can simply print Heather just to know

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:40.540
what is there in that?

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:45.140
Let's hear a function called death made where I'm gonna supply a final in.

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:52.060
So it's a CSP to Jason on the fine name here happens to be people don't CSE.

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:58.460
This has to be called somewhere Some say If Dunder name equals toe Dunder mean,

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.520
then we're gonna call the main method.

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.160
So let's go the command prompt in.

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:04.880
See if things are in place.

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:06.570
I'm gonna go around this file,

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:08.200
so fight on three.

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:09.140
Mei Yu Tyne,

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:09.860
start people.

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:12.460
You can see that there is an error.

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:17.650
It is that the file name must be a str So let's see what happened here.

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:18.980
So when we are comparing,

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:20.990
we're not supposed to combat it like this.

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:25.140
We have compared this with their data type just like none here without the courts.

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:30.280
So I have to simply take your str So let's go here and then clear the screen.

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:35.930
Run this program again and now you can see we got the header as a list here.

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:38.570
So I d name email Phone city,

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:39.150
etcetera.

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:44.080
Now that we know that the header contains the first line in the list format,

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:45.690
I have the header.

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:50.800
I lead the values now so I can take one line from the file again.

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:58.430
And for that I can use their far group against a for line in If if you remember,

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:01.780
the file object itself is an each level,

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:04.600
you can take one line a two time from deal,

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:05.820
which is lying.

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:11.660
Now I need to convert each off these lines one line at a time in tow,

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:12.660
Another list,

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:15.260
which is again a very similar concept.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:16.490
You're really the line.

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:17.860
We have the line here,

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:19.380
we need to strip it.

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:24.490
And then we need to take the comma separated values into a list and that I'm gonna call it

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:24.790
us.

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:27.190
Values equals tow line,

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:31.150
dark street door split on a comma.

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:33.600
So now this is basically values.

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:35.560
And in the previous video,

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:40.380
we have learned how to actually sit them together and convert that into a date.

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:47.560
So I can simply say your data equals toe picked off zip off Heather and values.

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:49.080
Now we have the data,

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:51.280
which is one single dictionary.

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:53.460
Let's bring that and see how it's gonna go.

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:55.760
So that's a print off data.

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:59.810
Come back to the command front on the court again.

00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:04.090
You'll see that I'm now getting that dictionary for each one off them.

00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:06.980
Each of these dictionaries are inside the loop.

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:09.490
So if I come out of this particular look,

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:10.800
that victory is gone.

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.330
Soto preserve the same.

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:15.480
So let's go and create here and a day off data.

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:20.840
So I'm gonna call it best Auto data equals toe an empty list.

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:25.500
And then I'm going to simply append this data to this particular area data.

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:30.950
So I'm gonna promote your they aRer data about opened off data.

00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:32.430
All I could say,

00:08:32.430 --> 00:08:35.250
plus equal store than in squared regular can give the data.

00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:38.650
So if I come out of the loop and then print error of data,

00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:42.170
you'll see that it's the same thing.

00:08:42.170 --> 00:08:43.560
But in a list format.

00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:43.950
Now,

00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:48.930
one last thing that I have to do here is toe convert this entire list in tow,

00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:49.800
Jason,

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:53.680
which can be done by using the model Jason.

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:55.880
So the first thing that I have to do is tow,

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:56.390
say,

00:08:56.390 --> 00:08:57.460
your import,

00:08:57.460 --> 00:08:58.180
Jason,

00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:01.900
and then come down in stuff printing that right here.

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:08.090
I can simply say you're dreamed Jason dot dumps and then supply the air.

00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:12.010
Our data I can also supply indent equals two,

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:12.760
for example,

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:15.010
three so that it nicely form.

00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:16.250
It's the output.

00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:19.240
So I'm gonna go and run this once more.

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:21.820
Let's clear the screen first on,

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:26.060
you'll see that we have a perfect Jason data or put,

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:29.570
consisting off all the key value pairs from the CSP file.

00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:33.870
Let's say if you want to save this content into a file on bond,

00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:35.990
let's also supply the second parameter,

00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:40.430
which is the old court filing that save people don't Jason.

00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:46.410
And it's also received that as probably off finding two relievers.

00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:47.860
Five Name is the input file.

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:49.990
Out filing is the output file.

00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:55.160
We can also check if the old put file name must be a string by making a copy of the same

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:55.520
thing.

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:57.560
I leave that as it is right now.

00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:01.570
In order for me to write this now I have toe simply say,

00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:02.080
here,

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:06.200
remove this print on the corresponding bracket.

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:06.780
Adam,

00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:08.650
with this s to make this a stump.

00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:12.000
But the second argument is a file object.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:12.510
So again,

00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:16.400
I can say you're something like with open off,

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:18.480
out filing as,

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:18.850
let's say,

00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:19.460
for example,

00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:22.890
out and then I'll say Jace under dump,

00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:24.090
they are underscored.

00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:26.790
Data out is the second perimeter,

00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:28.200
which is the file pointer.

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:33.180
Indian vehicles to tree will be optional because in the final you really don't want the

00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:33.920
indentation,

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:35.720
so I can as well get off that,

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:36.740
but for no I'm going.

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:38.650
Keep it as it is now.

00:10:38.650 --> 00:10:40.160
If I run the core,

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:43.160
it's actually going to start the main function.

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:46.390
Main function is going to call this by supplying to file claims.

00:10:46.390 --> 00:10:49.950
This filing is opened for read.

00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:54.230
But as this file should be open for the old put more off the right moves.

00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:58.270
That same articles toe W so the file name is checked on.

00:10:58.270 --> 00:10:59.540
The input file is checked.

00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:01.580
The output file will be created anyway,

00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:02.970
so there's no need to check that.

00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:05.420
We opened the input file name.

00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:10.370
We converted the first line into a list off headers on.

00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:13.880
Then we really each line one line at a time,

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:16.290
convert them into a list off values,

00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:21.530
and then we use the zip to convert them into a group of pupils.

00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:23.950
Positive dicked constructor.

00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:25.370
We get a dictionary.

00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:28.830
We opened them toe the list that we created over here,

00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:29.980
which is an empty list.

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:31.850
So by the end of this far,

00:11:31.850 --> 00:11:32.040
Lou,

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:38.000
people have gone through on the lens off CSU file and then converted them into a list off

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:38.770
dictionaries.

00:11:38.770 --> 00:11:41.010
Now that we have the list of dictionaries,

00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:47.320
we opened the file in the right more here and then we write this are dumped this in the

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:51.080
Jason format into this file with an optional indent off.

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:51.560
Three.

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:55.120
Let's go and check if we have the people don't see us.

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:56.200
We and Jason.

00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:59.910
You can see that I only have people that CSP and no Jason.

00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:00.280
Fine.

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:04.180
That's on our core by typing Fight on tree My,

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:05.380
You didn't start b y.

00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:08.920
It simply comes out to the command Brown without giving any old port.

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:12.990
But if I check the directional for people star,

00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:15.300
you can see that I have people that Jason,

00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:19.340
if you go back to be a score and look at what is there in people that Jason,

00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:22.560
it consists off the exact same content here.

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:22.870
Now,

00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:25.700
Since we're using a for loop over here,

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:29.680
we can as well use a list comprehension.

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:30.840
For example,

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:32.820
let's commander these lines.

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:35.650
Let's get a new variable air on the score.

00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:38.110
Data equals toe a new list.

00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:41.650
I'm gonna make some space by pressing Enter here now,

00:12:41.650 --> 00:12:43.840
Since this is open and close here,

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:45.630
the indentation is not a problem.

00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:50.800
So it's considered a single statement right now because the list comprehension depends on a

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:54.000
loop so I'm gonna use this for line in F.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.560
So that's my actually loop variable called line,

00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:02.890
which is a single line complete line with comma separated values on a Nuland character.

00:13:02.890 --> 00:13:07.870
And I have toe use this function called strip mint split together,

00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:09.550
talking about that in your list,

00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:12.520
and then this is going to be my old values.

00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:15.050
I'm gonna copy this and based over here,

00:13:15.050 --> 00:13:17.270
but I don't have anything core values,

00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:20.650
but values is nothing but lined outstrip dot splits.

00:13:20.650 --> 00:13:21.650
I'm gonna copy this.

00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:24.820
Replace over here as a GNC.

00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:30.880
I am not using a for loop your but I'm using a list comprehension where this is the old

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:37.190
good value from each off the iteration where each line is picked up from the fight that's

00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:43.320
going ticket or in the command front by running the fight on three Mei Yu Tyne start P Y.

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:45.840
There is no better if I go back to people.

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:46.150
Don't,

00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:47.090
Jason.

00:13:47.090 --> 00:13:49.480
You will see that it still exist.

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:52.580
Let's do a double check by deleting the files.

00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:56.170
I'm gonna say arm people don't Jason.

00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:58.230
Andi,

00:13:58.230 --> 00:13:59.540
that's enter.

00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:02.280
So now you see that there is no such file here,

00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:03.920
So there's only people don't see us.

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:07.130
We if I go and run my court here,

00:14:07.130 --> 00:14:09.000
my util start P Y on.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.270
If you check the directory,

00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:12.200
you'll see that they're the people that Jason.

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:13.050
And if I come back,

00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:14.160
your people don't.

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:16.150
Jason contains the same data again.

00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:22.790
So this way you can convert a very complex for lube into a simple list comprehension.
