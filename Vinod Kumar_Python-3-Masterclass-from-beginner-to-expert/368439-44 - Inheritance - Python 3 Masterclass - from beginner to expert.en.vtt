00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.730
so what?

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:05.120
I have different types of employees classes like,

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.820
for example,

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:06.570
salesmen,

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:07.670
manager,

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:14.280
etcetera instead of relating all these functions and properties once again for those

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:14.920
classes,

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:15.200
said,

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.710
like salesmen and manager,

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.940
we can actually reuse this employ class by inheriting them in the respective classes.

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:26.350
So the whole purpose off inheritance is called reusability.

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:30.550
Let's consider a new script file E X 24.

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:31.760
Don't be well,

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:37.420
wherein I Want toe create a new class called Salesman that inherit from the employed.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:38.810
Plus so first time,

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:43.000
I have to say from the extra three import employ.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.920
Then I said,

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.250
Class salesman and in bracket here we're going to specify a class name,

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.700
which happens to be employees we know.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:57.580
Call Salesman is the subclass employees as the super close in other languages,

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:02.780
you may consider statesman to be a direct plus an employee as the base loss and let's give

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.640
a colon and for the time being,

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.150
a mother simply safe pass.

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.680
Let's go to a command prompt on gettinto potential where I can create an object off

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:12.350
salesman.

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:19.840
So from the X 24 import salesman and if I said the air off salesman,

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:26.490
you'll see that There are already members here called Ivy name salary off course under

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.510
arrest here and under in it anyway,

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:29.060
are they?

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:36.720
So I cleared an object off salesman that's a S one equals two salesmen and then supply need

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:37.420
the perimeter.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.770
Like,

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:38.650
for example,

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:40.970
job salary,

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:41.650
Equal stool,

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:47.570
Let's say 40,000 and then I can say I'd equals toe to toe 33 I can as well supply a couple

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:48.430
of other leaders,

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.010
but they will not be of any use for number for safe print s one.

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:56.390
You'll see that the str written in the employee class,

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.310
is being used on the S.

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.510
One is an instance or object off salesman Plus,

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:05.950
So now I can go back over here and add additional properties.

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.620
Features operate overloaded functions and so on and so forth.

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:13.990
Hence we say that the salesman class is an extension of the employees.

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:22.060
Plus So let's do that first by defining a constructor with the in it and take self as a

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.260
less keyword arguments.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:25.690
And then I would say here,

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.030
new properties off salesman,

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.040
for example,

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:36.650
self dot Let's a salesman has something called commission equals toe kw are start gift.

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.050
Let's side commission.

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:39.660
And likewise,

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.560
that's a salesman also has a region where he or she works with.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.580
Since I have overridden the image function in the field.

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:53.960
Zeman plants not employing class skin it will not be called on because of which the

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:54.460
employee,

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:57.360
plus name or salary i d.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.700
They would not be assigned to the salesman at all to test the same thing That's at a main

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:03.940
function over here.

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:04.820
Andi.

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:09.390
They will clear the salesman with all the values such as Ivy Name,

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.540
Salary Commission on the region.

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.360
And let's see when we print what is gonna happen.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.660
So I'm gonna say here,

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:25.690
salesman off name equals to let their job ID equals 2 to 33 salary by the fall of 25,000

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:26.840
again later as it is.

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.330
But let's give us 35,000 Commission percentage,

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:31.000
for example.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.690
Happens to be,

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:32.250
let's say,

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:33.220
12%.

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:38.020
And then region equals toe that they're not know that I have all these values.

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:40.030
Let's see if I say print s one.

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:45.210
What are we going to get in order to say that the main from chance Typical when we're on

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.940
the script.

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.410
So we say here If Dunder name equals toe.

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.350
Under May 10 we want to call the main function.

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:55.880
Let's go back to the command front,

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.540
exit out of the shells,

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.940
run this extra for P.

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:00.180
White,

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.450
so it's a vital three.

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.010
The extra leaf ordered the wine press ender.

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.670
You'll see that it is salesman.

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.310
Object has no attribute called Employ underscoring.

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:11.890
Discredit.

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.730
I feel wondering why I'm getting an error like this.

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:16.050
Let's go back over here.

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:21.100
We're actually really an object at this line by supplying five different named parameters,

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.250
all of them honest here over here.

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:28.460
And the silver values were only collecting commission on region and then ascending toe.

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:29.010
In this case,

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:30.110
it's just a variable,

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:31.290
not even a proper deeper.

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:32.610
It's being used,

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.240
but the remaining ones like name,

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:40.610
ivy and salary they have never Bean passed to the employee constructor.

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:41.390
Now,

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:44.720
in languages like Java or C plus brother seizure,

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:49.910
there is an automatic invocation off the super class constructor in bite on.

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:55.370
It has to be an explicit call on the way you can do is you can do any very one insect,

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:56.300
this constructor,

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:01.600
but gender practices you give it in the beginning and the way your call is your first call

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.600
.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:06.650
A function called Super Dis returns a reference off the super plus object.

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:13.450
And then you say your dot in it like this by supplying all the keyword arguments spread

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:14.050
across.

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:19.650
Now that I'm supplying this to the super plus constructor here it goes to the employee

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:25.380
Constructor receives theirselves yourself will be this object and then there is a key word

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:25.600
out.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.060
So all this will not be received in here.

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:34.420
I li name salary will be assigned using this property which which we have here and then

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:39.830
comes back and then ascends the commission and region over here Now off course,

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:46.770
there is no error in this because when s one is being printed s one dot str is called I

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:52.460
don't have any steer over here but the str is inherited from the employees and the str in

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:57.100
the employee Plus is actually turning back says the only name salary for which we got

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:02.160
another earlier We know that we are passing keyword arguments to the super close

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:02.830
constructor.

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:04.720
This error should not be dead.

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:10.790
Let's give it a try and you can see that it is idea is to 33 name is John surveys 35,000.

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:16.510
So the values that we supply to the salesman constructor have reached the employee member

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:17.190
variables.

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:21.550
Let's also define two properties over here called Commission and Region.

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:24.160
I do not want to go any validations over here.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:29.600
I think they say that property on the name of the property is called commission.

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:33.360
It takes a self as an argument for three terms.

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:38.530
Sell dot double underscore commission and then I'll say,

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:44.500
a center for the same at commission Door center and then at the Death Commission.

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:47.780
That's the functioning self and some value.

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:48.970
It doesn't matter what it is.

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:54.960
It's gonna be assigned itto Self dot Dunder commission equals toe commission.

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:55.770
Likewise,

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:58.030
I want to clear one more property,

00:06:58.030 --> 00:06:59.880
a pair of functions for region.

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:04.750
I'm gonna copy this base suit and then make the necessary changes.

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:10.090
So this is all going to be called Region.

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:11.350
So that's done now.

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:12.830
So let's go here.

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:14.100
No on right.

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:15.100
One more function,

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:20.400
which is the str function because str in the employee was only displaying the I D named

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:20.980
salary.

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:24.060
Now we also want to display the commission as well as region.

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:31.330
Let me add it after the in it so that the death under str itself and then I should return a

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:32.050
string,

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:39.840
which is let's a formula stream format that prints the implying object as well as the

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:41.690
details off the salesman.

00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:45.350
So I'm gonna say here employees equals two,

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:47.050
actually bracket,

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:48.020
comma.

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:49.760
Then it's a commission.

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:55.460
You construct a bracket region equals toe curly bracket like this.

00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:58.700
Now for the former functionaries supply three parameters.

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:03.420
This is nothing but the return value off the employee s tear function.

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:10.190
I can see your super to refer to the super close object d'art Dunder s tear.

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:12.510
I'm actually calling that.

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:17.240
Then I'm typing here Self taught commission which is have property No,

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:23.270
and still got region Another property Notice The originally away steer from the super class

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:27.820
function is a string on that string is gonna be substituted over here.

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:28.190
Now,

00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:31.760
if you want against around this the result in a groundbreaker,

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:32.490
just a group,

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:33.490
then apart.

00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:35.050
So let's go and give it a try.

00:08:35.050 --> 00:08:35.290
No.

00:08:35.290 --> 00:08:37.260
So when I print s one,

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:40.840
I expect all the values that are supplied for s one.

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:45.350
So let's give it a try again and you can see that it is employing.

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:47.090
Details are this now?

00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:47.660
Is it around?

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:48.380
Bracket here.

00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:49.290
Ideas.

00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:51.340
12233 Name is John.

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:51.800
Sorry.

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:52.730
35,000.

00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:53.980
But then you have commissioning.

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:54.810
Puts it well.

00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:58.160
Region Nichols to not So this is how you will be able,

00:08:58.160 --> 00:08:58.630
tow,

00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:04.450
inherit and make yourself all the functions and properties available in the super class.
