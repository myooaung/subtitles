00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.240
if you're coming from C C plus plus Java are seasia your usedto right in the main function

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.370
which is the starting point off execution.

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:12.740
Unlike those languages,

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:14.560
fighting is a scripting language,

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.640
which means the execution begins from line number one.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.550
But it this program here the line number one is just a definition of a function.

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:24.810
It is not an executable court.

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:31.150
This is just being loaded into the bite on watch ill machine and nothing happens over here

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.150
.

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.540
So this line you can you know,

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.210
this is a comment here.

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:36.740
Nothing happens over there.

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:42.470
So the line number eight also is a function definitions for nothing happens over there.

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:49.790
My number 11 to 15 are comments line number 17 Toe 30 is another function definition.

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:56.270
So literally speaking on these lines off court are never executive upto this particular

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:57.180
point in time.

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.060
However,

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:04.660
the actual forced line of execution is lying about 31 where I'm accepting a number than

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:05.710
another number.

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.830
Then I'm calling my own function,

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.200
which is this'll one and this is gonna make us off dysfunction on.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.250
Then the return value comes here.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.090
What is the number of days right?

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:17.000
And then of course,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.970
it's gonna print the number of days in the Given Montel here and that is the end of the

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:22.680
script.

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:23.510
Now,

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.580
instead of doing like this,

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.790
these lines can become part of another function generally named as me.

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.880
But you can write any name you want.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:34.620
However,

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.050
coming from other programming languages,

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:43.080
it's a good idea to have a function defined as Mai Sama Greater function here called left

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.600
me like this.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.680
And in order to make these statements as part of the main function,

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:55.050
I just have toe push this by one time so that they become part of the definition off main.

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.860
Now that the function main is created,

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.240
unless the main function is car,

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.710
there is no Allport.

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:02.430
For example,

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.240
if I simply save this girl that command prompt and then run the same,

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.810
you will see that there is no old put because once again,

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.670
this is also just a function definition on.

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.490
Unless you call anyone off them,

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.690
there is not going to be any output at all.

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.630
So this time we would like to call the function me like this.

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:27.440
So there is only a single line of execution that actually transfer the control domain.

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:33.430
And then this will actually transfer the control toe max days in month on in Max's off

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:34.080
month,

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.670
were actually passing the control toe easily and then easily is gonna written a tour,

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.260
fourth and so on and so forth.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.970
So this is a much cleaner way off writing a program.

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.500
So save this.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.350
Go under the same thing.

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.340
Now you can see it's gonna ask the month and then I will enter the year.

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.550
I'll get the number of days in that particular month and year.

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.740
So this is how main function is written.
