00:00:07,200  -->  00:00:10,110
Hello this is Kirill from forexboat dot com.

2

00:00:10,170  -->  00:00:15,660
And welcome to the sixth tutorial on testing and optimization and meditator forth in the previous tutorial

3

00:00:15,660  -->  00:00:20,650
we discussed the available models in this empty Four strategy tester.

4

00:00:20,730  -->  00:00:24,840
And those were the every tick control points and open prices models.

5

00:00:25,050  -->  00:00:29,280
And today we will be looking at the strategy test to report.

6

00:00:29,280  -->  00:00:34,140
Assuming that you have run a back test the report can be found in the report top down here.

7

00:00:34,470  -->  00:00:39,150
And what we will do is right click on the report and we'll save as report.

8

00:00:39,510  -->  00:00:43,230
And this allows us to export the report as an issue mail file.

9

00:00:43,230  -->  00:00:48,650
We will give it a name which reflects which expert adviser was tested.

10

00:00:48,650  -->  00:00:52,610
So a moving average report for example and we'll save that.

11

00:00:52,770  -->  00:00:58,310
And as you can see Mecir 4 has really brought it up as a file in a browser.

12

00:00:58,350  -->  00:01:04,140
I'm going to zoom out so that you can see a bit more of the report at the top here we have some statistics

13

00:01:04,140  -->  00:01:05,850
around the test.

14

00:01:06,030  -->  00:01:11,940
Then we have the chart and then we have a full list of all of the trades that were conducted.

15

00:01:11,940  -->  00:01:18,690
You can reference this list if you need to find out something about a particular trade.

16

00:01:18,720  -->  00:01:25,110
Now we won't be discussing this particular report because I have a much more interesting report prepared

17

00:01:25,110  -->  00:01:25,990
for you.

18

00:01:26,040  -->  00:01:27,600
I'll just bring that up now.

19

00:01:27,800  -->  00:01:29,300
And Azumanga.

20

00:01:29,340  -->  00:01:36,150
And as you can see from this report right away from the chart it is a profitable report and I think

21

00:01:36,150  -->  00:01:42,840
it will be more interesting for us to discuss this profitable report rather than that unprofitable one

22

00:01:42,840  -->  00:01:45,800
from the moving average pre-packaged expert adviser.

23

00:01:46,200  -->  00:01:52,260
So the system that was used in the back test for this report is called simple system version 2.0.

24

00:01:52,620  -->  00:01:59,460
And this is a proprietary algorithmic trading system which we will get to know very intimately in the

25

00:01:59,460  -->  00:02:06,540
next section of our course and you'll be able to download this for Robert or you could you can copy

26

00:02:06,540  -->  00:02:11,700
the code if you like and we'll be working very closely with this expert advisor we'll be optimizing

27

00:02:11,700  -->  00:02:17,850
it back backtesting it forward testing it and making sure that it gives us results like this which are

28

00:02:18,120  -->  00:02:23,460
profitable and we can actually use on our accounts for trading.

29

00:02:23,880  -->  00:02:25,910
Let's go ahead and discuss this report.

30

00:02:25,920  -->  00:02:33,260
We won't be looking at the actual trades that were conducted because we're more interested in the statistics

31

00:02:33,260  -->  00:02:34,080
up here.

32

00:02:34,500  -->  00:02:41,100
I will zoom in so that you can see the text a bit clearer and we'll start from the top and we'll work

33

00:02:41,100  -->  00:02:43,080
our way down through to the bottom.

34

00:02:43,100  -->  00:02:49,200
So at the top we have the name of the strategy the server where the test was conducted and the build

35

00:02:49,200  -->  00:02:50,630
of the trading platform.

36

00:02:50,810  -->  00:02:57,120
The mix is the symbol the financial instrument and the timeframe on which test is conducted here in

37

00:02:57,120  -->  00:03:02,880
brackets the dates are the dates that the trader chose for the back test.

38

00:03:03,120  -->  00:03:09,040
And then these dates of the actual dates when the test was in fact drawn.

39

00:03:09,240  -->  00:03:14,910
Sometimes the dates can be a bit different to the one specified because there wasn't sufficient data

40

00:03:14,910  -->  00:03:14,940
.

41

00:03:14,940  -->  00:03:20,520
For example I asked the test of your own from the second from the 23rd of February but the test was

42

00:03:20,520  -->  00:03:27,240
actually ran from the 24th of February and that is possibly because there wasn't enough data for the

43

00:03:27,240  -->  00:03:31,870
23rd maybe because that was a weekend or something like that.

44

00:03:31,890  -->  00:03:38,600
Next the model is one of those three models that we discussed in the previous tutorial in this case

45

00:03:38,610  -->  00:03:45,930
I chose every tick model the parameters is the parameters list of parameters for the trading system

46

00:03:45,930  -->  00:03:46,260
.

47

00:03:46,260  -->  00:03:51,010
This line will be always unique to every 4 x robot.

48

00:03:51,060  -->  00:03:58,080
And in this case simple system takes five parameters which we will discuss in more detail in the coming

49

00:03:58,080  -->  00:04:00,030
to Charles Barsoum test.

50

00:04:00,030  -->  00:04:07,230
There was a total of 4000 hourly bars in this specified six month period.

51

00:04:07,230  -->  00:04:11,210
The number of Tick's model was just over 4.2 million ticks.

52

00:04:11,370  -->  00:04:17,550
And the modeling quality was 90 percent which is very good mismatched chart errors is 0 which is also

53

00:04:18,210  -->  00:04:19,180
a good thing.

54

00:04:19,590  -->  00:04:23,540
If this number is just about zero then that's not really a big deal.

55

00:04:23,550  -->  00:04:26,890
It just means that there were some irregularities in the data.

56

00:04:27,200  -->  00:04:30,630
The initial deposit is starting balance of the test.

57

00:04:30,720  -->  00:04:35,290
The spread is then spread on which test was conducted.

58

00:04:35,430  -->  00:04:40,650
In this case it says Current theory meaning that I chose the current spread however I would like to

59

00:04:41,150  -->  00:04:46,310
warned you that you should be careful with when choosing the current spread because sometimes brokers

60

00:04:46,700  -->  00:04:48,790
increase their spreads for the weekends.

61

00:04:48,800  -->  00:04:53,600
And if you're running your test on the weekend then you can find yourself in a situation when you're

62

00:04:54,320  -->  00:05:01,760
running a test for spread of seven for a currency pair that on average during the week has a spread

63

00:05:01,760  -->  00:05:07,820
of four so you always have to consult with the brokers website to understand what the average spread

64

00:05:07,820  -->  00:05:08,880
is.

65

00:05:09,050  -->  00:05:15,190
But in my case I heard of three seemed reasonable for the British pound dollar currency pair.

66

00:05:15,290  -->  00:05:24,230
Next the total net profit is how much money you earned or the system earned in the during the back test

67

00:05:24,230  -->  00:05:24,250
.

68

00:05:24,260  -->  00:05:27,430
And it is equal to gross profit minus cross loss.

69

00:05:27,650  -->  00:05:31,540
So as you can see from the chart the starting balance was around 10000.

70

00:05:31,790  -->  00:05:36,140
And the final balance was around twenty thousand.

71

00:05:36,140  -->  00:05:41,390
So in this case the net profit is the difference between the ending balance and the starting balance

72

00:05:41,390  -->  00:05:50,270
so this earn profit is the total net profit the profit factor is the next parameter oh the next variable

73

00:05:50,270  -->  00:05:56,840
here so let's bring up a formula and see how the profit factors calculate and the formula for profit

74

00:05:56,840  -->  00:05:59,600
factor is gross profit or gross loss.

75

00:05:59,600  -->  00:06:06,380
So in our case it would be this gross profit of $25000 to buy $15000 Gross last gives us a proper five

76

00:06:06,380  -->  00:06:08,330
to one point seventy one.

77

00:06:08,480  -->  00:06:14,210
Generally in your trading systems you should aim for a profit factor above 1.5.

78

00:06:14,420  -->  00:06:20,800
And if your profit factor is below 1 then the trading system is making a loss expected payoff.

79

00:06:20,810  -->  00:06:25,880
The formula for expected payoff is a net profit divided by a total number of trades and this is pretty

80

00:06:25,880  -->  00:06:34,400
straightforward as expected prior payoff just tells you what is the average net profit per traits in

81

00:06:34,400  -->  00:06:44,530
our case it's $10000 to divide by 115 trades gives you approximately $93 of net profit per trade.

82

00:06:44,810  -->  00:06:53,990
The absolute drawdown Apso drawdown is by how much your balance curve went below the initial balance

83

00:06:53,990  -->  00:06:54,050
.

84

00:06:54,050  -->  00:07:03,110
So as you can see here the lowest the Bhasker curve has ever been is just $894 below the starting $10000

85

00:07:03,110  -->  00:07:10,120
deposit maximum drawdown is the maximum of all of the drawdowns which are present in your balance.

86

00:07:10,160  -->  00:07:18,270
So our drawdown is considered between the maximum in your balance curve and the consecutive minimum

87

00:07:18,270  -->  00:07:18,980
will get Baskar.

88

00:07:18,980  -->  00:07:21,830
So this in this for example is a drawdown.

89

00:07:21,950  -->  00:07:23,290
This is a drawdown.

90

00:07:23,330  -->  00:07:26,160
This is a drawdown and this is a drawdown.

91

00:07:26,300  -->  00:07:32,660
And in this case it appears that this is a maximal drawdown and the total value of this drawdown was

92

00:07:32,660  -->  00:07:42,300
approximately $3000 which represents 14 percent of that balance at the top of that peak relative drawdown

93

00:07:42,300  -->  00:07:42,320
.

94

00:07:42,330  -->  00:07:47,650
It's the same thing but backwards total trades is self-explanatory.

95

00:07:47,660  -->  00:07:53,270
Short positions that's how many short positions we have and that's how many what percentage of them

96

00:07:53,270  -->  00:07:53,750
we won.

97

00:07:53,750  -->  00:07:57,310
Same thing for long positions profit trades.

98

00:07:57,360  -->  00:08:04,840
That's we had a total of sixty eight profit trades and that was 59 percent of the total number of trades

99

00:08:04,850  -->  00:08:07,650
we had similar for last trades.

100

00:08:07,760  -->  00:08:12,530
Largest profit trade just tells you the value of the largest profit trade in dollars.

101

00:08:12,530  -->  00:08:15,550
Same thing for a large US last trade.

102

00:08:15,650  -->  00:08:17,450
Average same thing.

103

00:08:17,450  -->  00:08:20,420
Maximum consecutive wins and then profit of money.

104

00:08:20,420  -->  00:08:29,570
So we had a maximum of seven profits in a row and they brought us around $3000 and maximum we had consecutive

105

00:08:29,570  -->  00:08:33,380
losses was six and they and we lost $1700.

106

00:08:33,380  -->  00:08:35,040
The next line is the same thing.

107

00:08:35,060  -->  00:08:41,900
But backwords finally the average consecutive wins is the average profit in a row and consecutive losses

108

00:08:41,900  -->  00:08:45,970
the average number of losses we had in a row.

109

00:08:46,010  -->  00:08:50,350
So there you go that's how you read a strategy test to report.

110

00:08:50,360  -->  00:08:57,020
We'll be working more closely with some reports like this when we're talking about which parameters

111

00:08:57,020  -->  00:09:03,790
we should focus on how to evaluate the effectiveness of your trading strategies in the coming tutorials

112

00:09:03,800  -->  00:09:05,240
in this course.

113

00:09:05,240  -->  00:09:07,410
So that's it for this tutorial.
