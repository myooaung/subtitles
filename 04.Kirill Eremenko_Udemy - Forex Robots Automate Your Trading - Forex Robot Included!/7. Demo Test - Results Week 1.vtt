Hello this is Kirill from forexboat dot com.

2

00:00:09.390  -->  00:00:14.290
And welcome back to the course on testing and optimization in trade for.

3

00:00:14.370  -->  00:00:19.010
It's been a week since we launched our demo test and I just wanted to check in with you.

4

00:00:19.050  -->  00:00:25.980
So as you can see I've labeled the terminals so we know exactly where which set is running.

5

00:00:25.980  -->  00:00:29.430
Right away we can see that we already have some preliminary results.

6

00:00:29.550  -->  00:00:38.480
The top two terminals have incurred a bit of a loss as you can see here this there has been three loss

7

00:00:38.480  -->  00:00:39.710
trades in the past week.

8

00:00:39.720  -->  00:00:47.100
And altogether that was about minus 700 bucks on this account there was only two lost trades and that's

9

00:00:47.100  -->  00:00:49.170
about minus $600.

10

00:00:49.600  -->  00:00:57.390
And but the bottom two accounts have shown a much better picture which we hope will continue.

11

00:00:57.390  -->  00:01:06.580
So here we've got two trades which resulted in profits and altogether about five plus $560.

12

00:01:06.600  -->  00:01:14.790
And on this account we have three trades in the past week which resulted in profits and that's a proximately

13

00:01:14.790  -->  00:01:16.480
plus another $500.

14

00:01:16.620  -->  00:01:24.120
So that's the result so far hopefully these two accounts will continue bringing profits and maybe these

15

00:01:24.120  -->  00:01:27.770
accounts might recover during the rest of the test.

16

00:01:27.780  -->  00:01:31.370
We will check back in with these demo accounts in one week from now.

17

00:01:31.380  -->  00:01:33.340
I look forward to seeing you in the next tutorial.

18

00:01:33.340  -->  00:01:34.970
And until and happy trade
