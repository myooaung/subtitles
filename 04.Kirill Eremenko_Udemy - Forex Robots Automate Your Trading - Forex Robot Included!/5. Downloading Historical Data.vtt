00:00:02.780  -->  00:00:05.210
An

2

00:00:07.400  -->  00:00:09.500
hello this is Kirill from forexboat dot com.

3

00:00:09.510  -->  00:00:15.780
And welcome back to the course on testing and optimization in meditative for into this tutorial we will

4

00:00:15.780  -->  00:00:19.610
be talking about importing Dadda into meditative form.

5

00:00:19.860  -->  00:00:26.580
So there are three main ways of importing historical data into the platform and these are using the

6

00:00:26.580  -->  00:00:30.600
home key using medical Roadstar and using third party data.

7

00:00:30.720  -->  00:00:34.820
So let's go ahead and start with the first one using the home.

8

00:00:35.190  -->  00:00:42.140
If we open any chart with say Canadian dollar Japanese yen as you can see it's waiting for update.

9

00:00:42.150  -->  00:00:46.980
Meaning that the data initial data is loading and the chart hasn't been opened before.

10

00:00:46.980  -->  00:00:50.520
So what we wanted to do here is want to unclick auto scroll.

11

00:00:50.580  -->  00:00:57.670
We want to go to Tools Options in options we want to set in Max in the charts tab.

12

00:00:57.690  -->  00:01:04.030
You want to set max bars in history to the maximum Max bars and charged to the maximum as well.

13

00:01:04.110  -->  00:01:10.410
That will make sure that Medicare is not restricting you from downloading any data so you click OK.

14

00:01:10.410  -->  00:01:15.330
And if you go to Tools Options again you'll check you'll see that monitor for has automatically changed

15

00:01:15.330  -->  00:01:18.510
these values to the maximum.

16

00:01:18.510  -->  00:01:19.510
We're going to go back.

17

00:01:19.560  -->  00:01:25.440
And here we're going to scroll to the left and what you'll see is that first the scrolling is quite

18

00:01:25.440  -->  00:01:27.930
smooth but then it becomes chunky like now.

19

00:01:28.080  -->  00:01:35.640
And what that means is that we've reached the edge of our download a dot on the end and whenever we

20

00:01:35.640  -->  00:01:42.230
scroll more to the left Ameritrade or for he is requesting additional data from the trade server and

21

00:01:42.240  -->  00:01:45.050
you can check that by going to the History Center.

22

00:01:45.210  -->  00:01:51.120
At that point if you go to Tools history center or just click to a new keyboard and you go to the Canadian

23

00:01:51.430  -->  00:01:55.860
Museum of superior you'll see that the one hour time frame is highlighted meaning that only for this

24

00:01:55.860  -->  00:01:59.020
time frame we've received data.

25

00:01:59.340  -->  00:02:05.020
So if you go here and you go to the bottom you'll see that the latest we have right now is July 2013

26

00:02:05.020  -->  00:02:05.040
.

27

00:02:05.040  -->  00:02:08.720
Let's close that let's scroll a bit bit more.

28

00:02:08.940  -->  00:02:16.130
And now we go back tools History Center and if we scroll down now we can see that it's May 2013.

29

00:02:16.380  -->  00:02:23.460
So we can take advantage of that and download daughter from the History Center all from the trade server

30

00:02:23.820  -->  00:02:31.500
by the example of that 15 minute time frame by just clicking the home button the home button does exactly

31

00:02:31.500  -->  00:02:33.910
the same as scrolling to the left.

32

00:02:34.080  -->  00:02:38.480
Just make sure you have this or scroll unchecked because otherwise that will interfere.

33

00:02:39.180  -->  00:02:40.880
Process A scroll to the left.

34

00:02:40.890  -->  00:02:47.930
So if I'm holding the homepage down right now and as you can see the chart is flying through the dates

35

00:02:48.000  -->  00:02:51.450
meaning more and more data is being downloaded.

36

00:02:51.660  -->  00:02:58.650
And of course at some point you will hit a limit and that's just because there isn't any more water

37

00:02:58.650  -->  00:03:03.990
on the trade server the trade servers tend to delete data that's too old because then because of trying

38

00:03:03.990  -->  00:03:09.870
to hide something but because it's inefficient for them to store large volumes of thoughted can significantly

39

00:03:09.870  -->  00:03:18.360
impact their bandwidth if all the traders will start downloading it and that can impact processing times

40

00:03:18.360  -->  00:03:19.230
of your orders.

41

00:03:19.260  -->  00:03:20.600
We don't want that.

42

00:03:20.910  -->  00:03:26.400
And also just make sure you have zoomed out to the maximum that allows you to scroll through the data

43

00:03:26.400  -->  00:03:32.330
faster so you can see I've gone quite far and gone all the way to October 2012.

44

00:03:32.810  -->  00:03:38.760
Usually they'll be a restriction of depending on the chart time frame maybe a year or maybe over several

45

00:03:38.760  -->  00:03:39.480
months.

46

00:03:39.480  -->  00:03:46.260
So in this case it's about two years which is quite generous from on the brokerage side and you can't

47

00:03:46.260  -->  00:03:47.320
go any further.

48

00:03:47.340  -->  00:03:49.120
That's a very simple method.

49

00:03:49.200  -->  00:03:53.730
And if that's if you can get sufficient data for your testing that way then please go ahead.

50

00:03:53.730  -->  00:04:00.660
That is probably the most accurate data that you will get because it is actually from your broker.

51

00:04:00.930  -->  00:04:06.810
Do bear in mind that if you are using every tick model then you have to do this process for all of the

52

00:04:06.840  -->  00:04:10.200
timeframes that are below the time from where you're going to be testing.

53

00:04:10.200  -->  00:04:17.010
So that includes a 1 in 5 and 15 and so on all the way up to your designated time frame.

54

00:04:17.040  -->  00:04:20.150
So that was the first no way of doubling data.

55

00:04:20.170  -->  00:04:26.730
Let's look at the other ones so now we have the medical Loadstar medical start implies that we get data

56

00:04:26.730  -->  00:04:27.450
from medico's.

57

00:04:27.450  -->  00:04:33.360
So if we go to history center and we pick a currency pair here which I haven't looked at for example

58

00:04:33.360  -->  00:04:38.360
euro Australian dollar go to the one minute timeframe as you can see it's empty right now.

59

00:04:38.360  -->  00:04:42.200
Bit of data will download from the broker about what we can do here.

60

00:04:42.210  -->  00:04:44.730
We can click this download button.

61

00:04:44.820  -->  00:04:50.700
Give us a warning saying that we're about to download data from the medicore software corporation history

62

00:04:50.710  -->  00:04:56.730
center but our county is open with somebody else that just basically means that there will be discrepancies

63

00:04:56.730  -->  00:04:58.520
between the two data sets.

64

00:04:58.530  -->  00:05:05.550
And so you have to take that into account because it can significantly affect your expert Wise's when

65

00:05:06.120  -->  00:05:08.010
testing them on small timeframes.

66

00:05:08.010  -->  00:05:13.080
However if you do too if you are planning on testing on high timeframes and generally that shouldn't

67

00:05:13.530  -->  00:05:21.170
really impact your expert advisers and give you a good indicative result of what you can expect.

68

00:05:21.430  -->  00:05:26.020
And that's because Forex is is a common market.

69

00:05:26.140  -->  00:05:33.480
And even though there can be slight fluctuations generally the trends should be very similar even in

70

00:05:33.480  -->  00:05:36.390
different data sets and you can use that to advantage.

71

00:05:36.390  -->  00:05:40.590
However do be careful when using the medico's quotes data.

72

00:05:40.590  -->  00:05:46.020
All right so that took a couple of minutes for me I think it took about 10 or maybe even 15 minutes

73

00:05:46.020  -->  00:05:47.840
a day it is quite a lengthy process.

74

00:05:47.850  -->  00:05:53.790
But if you scroll down here you'll see that we have one minute daughter for this currency bill all the

75

00:05:53.790  -->  00:05:56.940
way from 2004 which is incredible.

76

00:05:56.940  -->  00:06:04.820
It's over for over 10 years of daughter and that that should be plenty for any kind of test analysis

77

00:06:04.830  -->  00:06:05.690
.

78

00:06:05.700  -->  00:06:12.390
So now what you can do is if you click download again click OK.

79

00:06:13.020  -->  00:06:18.330
What will happen is that because all of this data is already downloaded and this is an interesting trick

80

00:06:18.330  -->  00:06:21.520
Ameritrade for all those that is already downloaded.

81

00:06:21.600  -->  00:06:27.860
And if you do it like right away that means that there's no new virus that are expected to come in.

82

00:06:28.110  -->  00:06:33.880
Then you'll get this message saying that there are no new daughter for symbol euro strength.

83

00:06:33.890  -->  00:06:36.030
Bill do you want to recalculate all the time.

84

00:06:36.030  -->  00:06:37.950
Friends and here you click yes.

85

00:06:37.950  -->  00:06:44.260
And what that will do is it will actually recalculate all of the time frames for this currency pair

86

00:06:44.260  -->  00:06:44.420
.

87

00:06:44.490  -->  00:06:49.880
And if you go to any of the time frames you'll see that you have this data from 2004.

88

00:06:50.070  -->  00:06:52.080
So there you go.

89

00:06:52.110  -->  00:06:53.590
There once again there it is.

90

00:06:53.610  -->  00:06:56.180
And any time frame of this currency.

91

00:06:56.460  -->  00:06:59.690
It's all there it's all being calculated from the one minute time frame.

92

00:06:59.700  -->  00:07:02.460
That's why it's good to download the one time frame first.

93

00:07:02.460  -->  00:07:10.420
So there you go that's how you get a lot of data for your indic. testing and Medicare for hour repeated

94

00:07:10.530  -->  00:07:17.970
indic. because the results of these back Tests can be different to what you'll see on the real servers

95

00:07:17.980  -->  00:07:18.490
.

96

00:07:18.990  -->  00:07:24.290
However that's not always the case and sometimes this method is appropriate.

97

00:07:24.300  -->  00:07:25.830
So I think that's enough for today.

98

00:07:26.010  -->  00:07:31.650
We've covered the first two methods and the next a total took about important third party data into

99

00:07:31.650  -->  00:07:32.960
Ameritrade four.

100

00:07:33.120  -->  00:07:36.620
Thanks for watching and I'll look forward to seeing you on the next tutorial.

101

00:07:36.630  -->  00:07:37.830
Until then Happy training
