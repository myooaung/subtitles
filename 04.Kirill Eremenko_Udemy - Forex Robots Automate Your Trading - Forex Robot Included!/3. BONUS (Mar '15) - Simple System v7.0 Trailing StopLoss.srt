00:00:00,670  -->  00:00:03,190
Hello this is Kirill from forexboat dot com.

2

00:00:03,210  -->  00:00:07,780
And welcome back to the course on testing and optimization in a traitor for.

3

00:00:07,970  -->  00:00:14,640
And today's a bonus to Tauriel because I have just updated the simple system expert adviser and I wanted

4

00:00:14,640  -->  00:00:17,550
to show you what's new and how to use it.

5

00:00:17,610  -->  00:00:22,110
So we're up to version 7 of the simple system for each robot.

6

00:00:22,260  -->  00:00:28,590
And before we dive into this I'll show you where you can get it if you don't know yet.

7

00:00:28,590  -->  00:00:31,740
So you go to one second.

8

00:00:32,070  -->  00:00:37,080
So you go to Forks both dot com slash simple haif system.

9

00:00:37,320  -->  00:00:41,990
And here on this page if you scroll down a bit you'll see the latest versions.

10

00:00:42,090  -->  00:00:46,950
So the latest version now a simple system version so on point oh you just click on it or right click

11

00:00:46,950  -->  00:00:48,380
and save link as.

12

00:00:48,460  -->  00:00:54,420
And you will get the zip file which contains expert advisor here put in a bit of a description what's

13

00:00:54,420  -->  00:00:56,880
new in the in this version.

14

00:00:56,910  -->  00:00:59,460
But we'll talk about that in this Titor.

15

00:00:59,490  -->  00:01:04,780
So if you haven't got it yet go ahead and download it and you can follow me in this tutorial.

16

00:01:05,220  -->  00:01:11,430
All right going back so here we've got a simple system expert advisor selected.

17

00:01:11,430  -->  00:01:18,120
Now I'm just going to go to exper properties and here you can see that we've got two new settings or

18

00:01:18,120  -->  00:01:24,060
two new parameters that you can set for the sexpert visor and these are used trailing stop loss and

19

00:01:24,060  -->  00:01:25,140
trail value.

20

00:01:25,350  -->  00:01:35,010
And that's right as quite a few of you have already requested I have added the trailing stop loss module

21

00:01:35,010  -->  00:01:36,390
into this expert wise.

22

00:01:36,570  -->  00:01:43,380
So if you're not familiar with what a traffic stop is not a not a worry we will talk about that right

23

00:01:43,380  -->  00:01:46,140
now and I'll explain to you exactly how it works.

24

00:01:46,140  -->  00:01:53,250
So to start off with I'll just show you that you can still use expert visor as it were in the previous

25

00:01:53,250  -->  00:01:57,250
version so if you don't want to use the same model just click false here.

26

00:01:57,450  -->  00:02:04,230
And then the module will be just activated so just go ahead and launch it now and you'll basically see

27

00:02:04,940  -->  00:02:07,830
that nothing really nothing has changed at all.

28

00:02:07,830  -->  00:02:15,040
So here are British pound dollar is generating ticks and there is a sell order.

29

00:02:15,180  -->  00:02:22,740
And basically just as per usual the expert advisor is letting this order you know play out as it's supposed

30

00:02:22,740  -->  00:02:23,570
to play out.

31

00:02:23,580  -->  00:02:25,540
Let's have a look at another one.

32

00:02:26,640  -->  00:02:28,030
So that's a buy order.

33

00:02:28,140  -->  00:02:33,300
And as you can see so the seller was profitable the buyer order turned into a loss so we'll stop at

34

00:02:33,300  -->  00:02:35,080
that.

35

00:02:35,190  -->  00:02:39,080
And now we'll explain how the stop trailing stop loss works.

36

00:02:39,660  -->  00:02:42,420
So let's go here and change.

37

00:02:42,450  -->  00:02:44,130
Use trailing stop loss to true.

38

00:02:44,190  -->  00:02:45,860
We'll leave it at 40 pips.

39

00:02:46,140  -->  00:02:55,200
And what that means is that the expert adviser will automatically maintain a given distance from the

40

00:02:55,200  -->  00:03:00,820
price to your Stop-Loss so it won't allow the price to run away from your stop loss.

41

00:03:00,930  -->  00:03:01,900
In a sense.

42

00:03:02,180  -->  00:03:09,480
So if if the market is going in a favorable direction to your order then that means a stop loss will

43

00:03:09,660  -->  00:03:15,380
be just we'll just keep following the market price at this set distance of 40 pips.

44

00:03:15,480  -->  00:03:19,260
If the market is going against your order then the stop loss won't move.

45

00:03:19,290  -->  00:03:22,380
So the market will just get close to stop loss.

46

00:03:22,380  -->  00:03:27,830
It might be a bit complicated at first to understand but let's have a look at it a live example that

47

00:03:27,840  -->  00:03:29,960
that's probably the best way to understand it.

48

00:03:30,210  -->  00:03:32,110
So I'm just going to restart this expert advice.

49

00:03:32,130  -->  00:03:36,720
But now with the trailing stop loss and we will carefully examine what's going on.

50

00:03:37,080  -->  00:03:42,180
So I'll I'll just pause this process at some points.

51

00:03:42,200  -->  00:03:42,470
All right.

52

00:03:42,470  -->  00:03:46,830
So as you can see there we had a stop loss sell or open.

53

00:03:46,950  -->  00:03:49,340
And if you notice the stop loss has already moved.

54

00:03:49,350  -->  00:03:54,780
So just watch the stop loss up here and look how it moves with that order.

55

00:03:55,140  -->  00:03:59,450
See do you see it like jumping and that is because it's always maintaining a distance.

56

00:03:59,460  -->  00:04:04,470
If I measure this distance it's going to be well in this case it's 43 pips or 42 picks.

57

00:04:04,500  -->  00:04:06,570
That's because it includes the spread.

58

00:04:06,570  -->  00:04:09,660
But if you take out the spread it's exactly 40 pips.

59

00:04:09,660  -->  00:04:16,830
So what the expert Wiser's doing is it's moving the Stop-Loss closer and closer and closer to the price

60

00:04:16,830  -->  00:04:18,690
just to maintain this distance.

61

00:04:18,840  -->  00:04:23,080
If the price happens to go back towards a stop loss in the stock loss or more.

62

00:04:23,190  -->  00:04:33,570
So you kind of specifying the maximum distance that can be like can be observed between the price and

63

00:04:33,570  -->  00:04:34,260
the stop loss.

64

00:04:34,410  -->  00:04:36,900
So let's just keep playing that a bit for a bit longer.

65

00:04:36,900  -->  00:04:41,840
You see the price went back up so I'll just probably slow this down by one bar.

66

00:04:41,910  -->  00:04:45,590
So the price went back that the stock was the right move.

67

00:04:45,600  -->  00:04:50,730
Which is which is kind of the core concept of the stop was and only moves when the market is moving

68

00:04:50,730  -->  00:04:51,950
in a terrible direction.

69

00:04:53,300  -->  00:04:55,300
So probably slowed down a bit more.

70

00:04:55,330  -->  00:05:02,410
And so they see like as long as the stop loss is less than 40 pips on it from the price.

71

00:05:02,430  -->  00:05:08,100
It doesn't move it stays where it is but as soon as it's the price of one more doll the stop loss will

72

00:05:08,100  -->  00:05:10,590
start moving as well.

73

00:05:10,590  -->  00:05:15,620
See like the price move down and the Stop-Loss move down with it.

74

00:05:16,290  -->  00:05:19,850
And there we go so that's where the take profit was hit.

75

00:05:19,870  -->  00:05:24,580
And basically the order was closed.

76

00:05:24,840  -->  00:05:30,690
So you can see by these two the red marks the stop loss started here and moved all the way here with

77

00:05:30,690  -->  00:05:31,790
the price.

78

00:05:31,800  -->  00:05:38,790
All right let's keep keep playing this and let's watch the next one.

79

00:05:41,100  -->  00:05:44,890
So we'll just give it a few seconds till the next door's opened.

80

00:05:45,060  -->  00:05:52,340
As you remember it was a byword or a byte order which previously closed at the top also here in the

81

00:05:52,350  -->  00:05:57,030
previous example when we're looking at how the expert reviser which followed this model.

82

00:05:57,180  -->  00:06:02,010
So now we're going to also carefully observe the stop loss and other stock losses at the bottom because

83

00:06:02,000  -->  00:06:02,880
it's a buy order.

84

00:06:02,970  -->  00:06:05,380
Let's see what happens.

85

00:06:05,520  -->  00:06:13,680
Can you see that the Stop-Loss is moving up and that is because our prices going up so the stock losses

86

00:06:13,740  -->  00:06:15,950
also maintain still at.

87

00:06:16,280  -->  00:06:17,880
In this case 36.

88

00:06:18,250  -->  00:06:19,390
Oh well sorry.

89

00:06:19,470  -->  00:06:29,340
From the maximum the price so in this case it's about 40 pips So that's because the basically the price

90

00:06:29,340  -->  00:06:34,280
that you see on the chart is the bid price but by all it was open at the ask price.

91

00:06:34,290  -->  00:06:38,330
So if you include if you measure from Ask price is still going to be foolish.

92

00:06:38,340  -->  00:06:41,890
It's just like in the case with the stop loss of the seller.

93

00:06:42,120  -->  00:06:45,630
But nevertheless let's just watch the stop loss here.

94

00:06:46,920  -->  00:06:49,560
So you can see the stop loss isn't moving.

95

00:06:49,580  -->  00:06:50,420
Prices going down.

96

00:06:50,430  -->  00:06:51,970
The stop loss is not moving.

97

00:06:52,200  -->  00:06:55,470
And there you go the order got close at the stop loss price.

98

00:06:55,470  -->  00:06:58,420
So what can we observe from this example.

99

00:06:58,500  -->  00:07:05,530
Well the main thing is that previously the buy order closed at this price so lower over here.

100

00:07:05,550  -->  00:07:11,280
Now the buy or reclosed here so if we keep playing this you'll see that the price did eventually go

101

00:07:11,370  -->  00:07:18,310
all the way down but we got out of the market early so the loss that we incurred from this buy order

102

00:07:18,480  -->  00:07:22,980
could have been greater but because we had a trailing stop it got reduced.

103

00:07:22,980  -->  00:07:30,030
So that's the main principle the trailing stop loss that it kind of helps you not only control your

104

00:07:30,030  -->  00:07:36,030
losses but to reduce them in certain cases so when when the market goes in your favor you take advantage

105

00:07:36,030  -->  00:07:44,900
of those movements in your favor and you you kind of fortify the ground that you have conquered.

106

00:07:44,910  -->  00:07:52,670
So the price is moving with you so that means you can move your Stop-Loss more and that way you're slowly

107

00:07:52,740  -->  00:07:57,660
slowly gaining on and gaining on until your stop loss actually gets to the break even point.

108

00:07:57,690  -->  00:08:01,130
And from there it will keep going with the price.

109

00:08:01,300  -->  00:08:03,990
Unless you're of course you're already reached to take Kropp.

110

00:08:04,380  -->  00:08:08,030
That's a very handy way to manage you.

111

00:08:08,040  -->  00:08:12,790
For exporters it might not be the best idea in all trading systems.

112

00:08:12,810  -->  00:08:21,090
And for some types of markets trailing stop losses might not improve how well the forex robot works

113

00:08:21,090  -->  00:08:21,250
.

114

00:08:21,330  -->  00:08:23,100
But once again it's up to you.

115

00:08:23,100  -->  00:08:27,340
So in this course we learn how to optimize Forex robots.

116

00:08:27,500  -->  00:08:35,640
If you want to go ahead please feel free to use this module and test it out and see how it can improve

117

00:08:36,000  -->  00:08:39,740
the performance of your forex robot.

118

00:08:39,790  -->  00:08:47,260
And like just as we do with all the other parameters we optimize them feel free to use this trailing

119

00:08:47,260  -->  00:08:49,770
stop loss and optimize it as well.

120

00:08:49,760  -->  00:08:56,610
However also on the other hand if you want to follow the course as well as the lectures are structured

121

00:08:56,880  -->  00:09:03,050
then bear in mind that we didn't have the trailing stop loss module when the course was created originally

122

00:09:03,060  -->  00:09:10,680
so perhaps in that case you might want to switch the trailing stop loss functionality off or finish

123

00:09:10,670  -->  00:09:15,700
the course and then once you're done then experiment with the truck stop loss.

124

00:09:15,750  -->  00:09:17,890
So that's all up to you.

125

00:09:17,930  -->  00:09:25,060
But it's always better to have the module and not use it than not have it and need it.

126

00:09:25,640  -->  00:09:26,730
And that's all for today.

127

00:09:26,730  -->  00:09:33,560
Don't forget to download the new simple system from folks support web site and look for it see you next

128

00:09:33,560  -->  00:09:34,130
then.

129

00:09:34,130  -->  00:09:36,130
Until then happy trading.
