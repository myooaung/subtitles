00:00:07.300  -->  00:00:09.600
Hello this is Kirill from forexboat dot com.

2

00:00:09.660  -->  00:00:15.210
And welcome back to the course on testing and optimization in MetaTrader 4. In the previous tutorial

3

00:00:15.210  -->  00:00:20.130
we talked about exploring the results in Excel.

4

00:00:20.220  -->  00:00:23.990
And today we're going to talk about the recovery factor.

5

00:00:24.090  -->  00:00:26.450
So what is the recovery factor.

6

00:00:26.610  -->  00:00:33.180
Well we know that in metatrader 4 there are multiple ratios that are already calculated for you for

7

00:00:33.180  -->  00:00:39.300
example the profit factor the expected payoff are both ratios.

8

00:00:39.300  -->  00:00:46.950
Then you also just have characteristics such as a drawdown in terms of value to it in terms of percentages

9

00:00:46.950  -->  00:00:48.620
total number chairs and profit.

10

00:00:48.840  -->  00:00:56.190
Moreover if you run any one of these optimization results as a back test and then you go to the graph

11

00:00:56.220  -->  00:01:05.070
and then you go to the report you can see the same ratios and even more here such as the number of positions

12

00:01:05.070  -->  00:01:14.940
that were won the short and long positions and consecutive wins and losses and so on a whole 1 ratio

13

00:01:14.970  -->  00:01:18.130
that is missing out of all of this is the recovery factor.

14

00:01:18.240  -->  00:01:23.000
And I find that a curry effect is a very important ratio in trading.

15

00:01:23.130  -->  00:01:26.490
So what is the formula for the recovery factor.

16

00:01:26.490  -->  00:01:27.910
Well it's pretty simple.

17

00:01:27.990  -->  00:01:33.210
The recovery factor is your net profit divided but your max drawdown.

18

00:01:33.450  -->  00:01:36.130
And let's have a look at data on an example.

19

00:01:36.360  -->  00:01:38.390
So we go back to this chart here.

20

00:01:38.610  -->  00:01:42.410
We're actually it's probably take a better chart.

21

00:01:42.610  -->  00:01:46.590
Take one of these top ones.

22

00:01:46.590  -->  00:01:53.920
So here you can see that your net profit was from $10000 to approximately twelve thousand eight hundred

23

00:01:53.920  -->  00:01:53.940
.

24

00:01:53.940  -->  00:02:03.660
So about $2800 this is your net profit and that's what is at in the numerator of the equation the net

25

00:02:03.660  -->  00:02:04.470
profit.

26

00:02:04.500  -->  00:02:12.750
So the total profit minus the gross profit months of gross loss and the maximum drawdown in terms in

27

00:02:12.750  -->  00:02:15.370
dollar terms would be this one.

28

00:02:15.370  -->  00:02:22.380
So if you divide your net profit by the maximal drawdown you get recovery factor and basically that

29

00:02:22.380  -->  00:02:29.610
means it tells you how quickly a system will be able to recover from a drawdown.

30

00:02:29.610  -->  00:02:39.630
So if your maximum drawdown is say $2000 and your net profit is $10000 then your recovery factual B5

31

00:02:39.660  -->  00:02:40.570
meaning.

32

00:02:40.650  -->  00:02:47.490
So a system move for higher recovery factor will climb out of its drawdowns faster and that's what you

33

00:02:47.490  -->  00:02:54.690
want to happen when you're trading for your system to be able to get out of these drawdowns which inevitably

34

00:02:54.690  -->  00:02:57.920
will happen because we can't predict everything 100 percent.

35

00:02:58.110  -->  00:03:05.790
We will always have times when the system is underperforming so but we want the system to be able to

36

00:03:05.790  -->  00:03:10.240
escape clum out of these as far as quickly as possible.

37

00:03:10.260  -->  00:03:13.050
So that's what the recovery factor tells you about.

38

00:03:13.290  -->  00:03:19.730
And unfortunately it's not an administrator for and not in any of the musician or results.

39

00:03:20.010  -->  00:03:27.800
And but we can easily fix that by exploring results in Excel and adding that as an extra column.

40

00:03:27.810  -->  00:03:30.190
So that's exactly what we're going to do today.

41

00:03:30.330  -->  00:03:37.110
Here I have the results are we exported last time and after column G I'm just going to add in your columns

42

00:03:37.100  -->  00:03:37.190
.

43

00:03:37.190  -->  00:03:45.620
All right click here and I'll click insert and here I'll call it recovery factor.

44

00:03:46.260  -->  00:03:52.930
And for the formula you want to divide your profit which is your net profit here.

45

00:03:53.040  -->  00:03:57.020
You want to divide that by your drawdown percent.

46

00:03:57.060  -->  00:04:00.860
So that's what we're going to type in here we're going to in equals.

47

00:04:01.060  -->  00:04:03.060
And then you just click left on your keyboard.

48

00:04:03.060  -->  00:04:08.270
Profit divided by draw down into the dollar.

49

00:04:08.790  -->  00:04:11.190
So you get a percentage here.

50

00:04:11.460  -->  00:04:15.030
But what we do want what we don't want to see it as a percentage.

51

00:04:15.030  -->  00:04:20.290
We want to see it as a number.

52

00:04:20.340  -->  00:04:29.970
So we go into our ratio and we're going to right click and we're going to click Format Cells and in

53

00:04:29.970  -->  00:04:36.340
this window is just going to click number and maybe one decimal point is sufficient for us.

54

00:04:36.510  -->  00:04:41.520
So we go we have a rationale and all you have to do now is just double click on this little box in the

55

00:04:41.520  -->  00:04:49.930
corner we just need to double click it and it will copy the formula across to cross going down.

56

00:04:50.220  -->  00:04:59.160
And so now if you click on the formula see that all of them are calculated as total net profit divided

57

00:04:59.160  -->  00:05:01.400
by the maximum drawdown.

58

00:05:01.800  -->  00:05:07.530
I'm just going to freeze the top pair and see if you just click on any cell and you go to Dahdah you

59

00:05:07.530  -->  00:05:11.240
go to these sir and then you go free is paying you click free still prone.

60

00:05:11.250  -->  00:05:17.720
If you scroll the top pros frozen and I'm sure many of you are already familiar with these Excel techniques

61

00:05:17.730  -->  00:05:23.730
I'm just making sure that everybody is able to follow.

62

00:05:24.210  -->  00:05:27.720
Now you can see that this recovery factor has been calculated.

63

00:05:27.720  -->  00:05:38.430
I'm just going to I'm just going to change the color here quickly so that we can visually this so we

64

00:05:38.430  -->  00:05:40.360
can see it better.

65

00:05:40.440  -->  00:05:43.380
That's that's great enough.

66

00:05:43.380  -->  00:05:43.790
All right.

67

00:05:43.800  -->  00:05:51.090
So what we wanted to do is now we want to look for the best re-occur factors say if we order by profit

68

00:05:51.090  -->  00:05:59.080
now then you'll see that the recovery factor is quite high here for some of the trades.

69

00:05:59.180  -->  00:06:02.800
If they don't don't realize this great let's make it like green

70

00:06:05.670  -->  00:06:11.550
as you can see the recovery factor is quite high and we'll talk more about this in the next tutorial

71

00:06:11.550  -->  00:06:11.570
.

72

00:06:11.580  -->  00:06:16.890
But you want to be aiming for recovery factor of at least two.

73

00:06:17.500  -->  00:06:25.650
And but an interesting thing you might notice is that the recovery factor for this best result is not

74

00:06:25.710  -->  00:06:31.570
as good as the recovery factor for this result which in terms of profit is lower.

75

00:06:32.040  -->  00:06:36.410
And let's have a look at these two results back and get a trader for and see you why.

76

00:06:36.570  -->  00:06:38.710
If we can spot the difference visually.

77

00:06:38.880  -->  00:06:44.110
So if we go to a shelter for order by profit we run the first one.

78

00:06:45.300  -->  00:06:56.880
So there's our chart and we can even save as picture and we'll save it as Rick have one.

79

00:06:56.980  -->  00:07:04.490
And now if we go to optimization results and actually go to our spreadsheet This is 1 4 9 6 is the run

80

00:07:04.510  -->  00:07:04.710
.

81

00:07:04.890  -->  00:07:11.660
So if we set this one as parameters and we run it now go to the graph and save this picture.

82

00:07:11.770  -->  00:07:16.200
Call this one too and I will look at them side by side.

83

00:07:16.200  -->  00:07:20.100
So this is the second one that we run with less profitable one.

84

00:07:20.160  -->  00:07:23.270
This is the first one that we ran.

85

00:07:23.430  -->  00:07:30.210
You will notice right away that it does make sense that the recovery factor of this result is better

86

00:07:30.210  -->  00:07:39.720
than this one because if this set climbs out of the drawdowns faster or so here it only took maybe 5

87

00:07:39.720  -->  00:07:44.330
trades five new trades to climb out of this record of this drawdown.

88

00:07:44.610  -->  00:07:51.240
Whereas here it took maybe 10 trades from tree number 41 to try and over 50 or even more to climb out

89

00:07:51.240  -->  00:07:52.610
of this drawdown.

90

00:07:53.370  -->  00:07:58.050
And that's that's exactly that proves our point.

91

00:07:58.050  -->  00:08:05.220
So recovery factor is a very important parameter and I think it should be in the standard set of parameters

92

00:08:05.220  -->  00:08:10.110
in or ratios in metatrader 4 but it's Herberts not at this stage.

93

00:08:10.140  -->  00:08:14.090
Nevertheless we're able to calculate it in Excel.

94

00:08:14.280  -->  00:08:19.200
That's all for today in the next tour and we'll talk about which parameters you should focus on when

95

00:08:19.230  -->  00:08:23.370
optimizing your expert advisors in military form.

96

00:08:23.580  -->  00:08:25.140
And until then Happy training
