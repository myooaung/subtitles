00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.990
All right, I think we are good with this module.

2
00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:07.170
Let us do a quick wrapâ€‘up.

3
00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.160
So what did you learn here?

4
00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:15.020
You learned how readers and writers are working in a very simple way.

5
00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:20.930
You saw how to read and write text from files. You saw how to deal

6
00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.640
with charsets. You saw how to deal with errors.

7
00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:30.820
So now let us apply that to a more complex use case, the reading of a CSV file.

8
00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:38.000
This is what we're going to cover in the next module. So see you there in a second.
