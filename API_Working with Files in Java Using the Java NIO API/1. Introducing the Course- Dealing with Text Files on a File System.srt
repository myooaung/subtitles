Hello, and welcome to this course,

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:09,860
Working with Files in Java Using the Java NIO API.

3
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:13,260
We are first going to cover how to access files on

4
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:17,540
directory with this path object from Java 7.

5
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:18,430
My name is Jose.

6
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:21,960
I'm a Java Champion and JavaOne Rock Star,

7
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:26,140
and I'm very glad to be your steward for this course.

8
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:32,420
This course is about handling a text file using the JavaSE API.

9
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:36,580
So we are going to first cover how to access files in

10
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:40,740
general within directories using this API.

11
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:44,300
And then we will see how to write or read the text

12
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:48,940
content to files using the JavaSE API.

13
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:53,250
And after that, we will cover a very important and useful use case,

14
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:57,340
which is how to access the content of a CSV file.

15
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:01,400
You know this CSV format that can be generated by Excel,

16
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,460
for instance, the wellâ€‘known Microsoft spreadsheet.

17
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:08,870
Well we're going to see how to analyze the content of a

18
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:12,190
CSV file using the JavaSE patterns.

19
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:17,870
And the last part we're going to cover is how to move files around,

20
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:23,510
take a file from a directory, move it to another one or copy it to another one.

21
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:28,920
And in this part, we'll also see two very important patterns from Java 7,

22
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,140
which are the walk pattern.

23
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:40,000
This pattern has been updated to support the stream API. And we will also cover this part.
