1
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:04,610
So what can you do with this path object?

2
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:09,000
Well, basically, you can do the same kind of thing as with the file object.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,240
You can access file in roughly the same way,

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,820
but you can get more information,

5
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:18,840
especially specific attributes dependent on your file system object.

6
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:23,890
So in a nutshell, a path is just used to access a file or a

7
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:27,990
directory on the given file system. You can get information

8
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:30,250
on this file or directory,

9
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:34,890
especially the different elements directory you are going to go through

10
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:38,540
to access this file and the same if it is a directory.

11
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:43,220
You can check if this element contains symbolic links or not. And

12
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:46,830
through different factory methods from the Files class,

13
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:53,040
you can have more information on the file or directory represented by this path.

14
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,060
Basically,

15
00:00:54,060 --> 00:01:05,000
can you read it, can you write it, can you execute it? Is this file or directory exists or not? This kind of information.
