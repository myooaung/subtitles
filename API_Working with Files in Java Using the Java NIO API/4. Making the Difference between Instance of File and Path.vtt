00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:07.010
So what are the differences between files object from

2
00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:11.230
JavaOne and paths object from Java 7? Well,

3
00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:15.070
the first biggest difference is that file is a

4
00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.940
class, whereas path is an interface.

5
00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:21.120
It means that for each file system,

6
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.720
for each type of filesystem that there exists,

7
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.180
I can have a different implementation of this path interface.

8
00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.270
And indeed, it is the case.

9
00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:35.500
The implementation for a Windows file system is not the

10
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.310
same as the one for Linux file system, for instance.

11
00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.290
Since a file is created on a string,

12
00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.440
it's just a wrapper on a string that represents a path on a filesystem.

13
00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.990
It is independent on any file system. And indeed,

14
00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:57.120
a file does not know anything about the file system it describes a file on,

15
00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.800
for instance. Whereas Java 7 introduces a file system class

16
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.490
with file system objects, and the path is necessarily linked

17
00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.990
to an explicit file system.

18
00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.310
If you do not tell the system which file system you're

19
00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.370
going to use when you create a path,

20
00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:24.000
this system will give you a path linked to your default file systems, which is most of the time the case.
