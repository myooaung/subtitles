1
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:04,700
Now suppose we mess up with this file.

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:11,040
The sonnet here he's a a UTF‑8 file as seen here,

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:16,600
and I have the same file there, but not in the same file format.

4
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,140
Here it's Cp1252.

5
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:24,590
So I'm going to try to read this ISO file instead of the first

6
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:29,680
one. Let me run this code, and you see that this file is still

7
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:34,180
read properly. If I check this sonnet‑ISO,

8
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:38,370
I can see that, in fact, the text is correct and the file is read properly.

9
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:42,740
But if I add my name, for instance, at the end of it,

10
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:46,590
don't get me wrong, I don't pretend I have returned this text myself, this is

11
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:50,600
William Shakespeare's work, with this funny character here,

12
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:55,650
which is an e acute, and run this code again, now I have this weird

13
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:59,750
exception telling me that the charset is not the right one. And if

14
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:02,180
you check the lines that have been read,

15
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:07,640
you can see that, indeed, this is this letter that created the exception.

16
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:11,450
This is very important to understand that this code is not

17
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:15,340
correct because the file is not included properly.

18
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:20,170
But if it turns out that you don't have any special characters in your file,

19
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:22,340
you will not see the exception.

20
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:24,850
So this is very important when you consider testing your

21
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:29,140
application to pass those special characters in it.

22
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:31,650
How can I fix this problem?

23
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:36,410
Well, this newBufferedReader here can take a further argument,

24
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:38,440
which is a charset.

25
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:44,650
And the nice thing is that I have this StandardCharSet class with

26
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:51,220
the ISO_8859 one, which is going to fix my problem. Now if I run

27
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:56,580
this code, I can see that my file is read properly. So just be

28
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:58,330
careful with the charset.

29
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:01,890
Always a test your code very thoroughly,

30
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:12,000
especially with the special characters because you may end up with buggy code that is going to be very hard to fix.
