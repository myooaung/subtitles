1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:01,040
Right my friends.

2
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:08,770
I hope you did amazing with that new exercise which was to predict the purchase decision of a new customer

3
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:09,420
in the set.

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:17,220
That was the first customer who is actually 30 years old and earns an estimated salary of eighty seven

5
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,340
thousand dollars right.

6
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:24,970
If we have a look at our test set you know the original tested before this killing this one.

7
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:32,730
This is exactly the customer you had to input in your predict method in order to predict the chaste

8
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:33,690
decision.

9
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:34,400
All right.

10
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:40,230
And now in this material we're going to check two things that first you've got the right implementation

11
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:44,830
and the predict method and mostly the right input inside the brick method.

12
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:48,870
And secondly we will also check if the prediction is correct.

13
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:54,450
And in order to do this well we're going to have a look at why test the Portuguese decision of that

14
00:00:54,450 --> 00:01:00,690
first customer is exactly this one you know because white contains all the real results here all the

15
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:02,610
real purchase decision.

16
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:10,140
And so we're going to see if indeed our model was able to make a correct prediction by predicting zero

17
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:16,170
for this first customer of age 30 an estimated salary eighty seven K..

18
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:17,460
All right let's do this.

19
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:21,050
Let's proceed to the solution.

20
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,280
Here it is predicting a new result.

21
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,430
I will leave the training.

22
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:25,110
And there we go.

23
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:27,270
So let's create a new coat sale.

24
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,580
And now what was the first step.

25
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:35,880
Well of course the first step was to take our classifier because of course that predict method as any

26
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:40,060
other method has to be called from the classifier object itself.

27
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:47,640
So we take our classifier object and then from this object we're going to call this predict method by

28
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,360
the way.

29
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,710
Let me show you this again.

30
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:55,570
You have other British method which are predict low probability which will return the log.

31
00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:00,660
You know the logarithmic function of the probability that your prediction is one.

32
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,530
You know that the purchase decision is one.

33
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:09,330
And you also have to predict brother method which returns of course directly the probability that the

34
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:10,740
purchase decision is one.

35
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:17,610
All right so depending on whether you want to have directly the final prediction 0 or 1 or the probability

36
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:20,220
that the dependent variable is equal to one.

37
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:23,080
Well you had the choice between predict and predict.

38
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:23,930
OK.

39
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:29,460
So here we're going to take predict because we directly want to get the prediction whether or not that

40
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:33,910
first customer of the test set for chased yes or no the SUV.

41
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:39,030
So here we're going to add some parenthesis and now now I'm really interested if you've got this right.

42
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:45,360
What did you put inside a predict method in order to predict the purchase decision of that customer

43
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:51,090
who is 30 years old and earns an estimated salary of eighty seven thousand.

44
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:51,540
All right.

45
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:54,700
Well first of all let's remind the essential.

46
00:02:54,870 --> 00:03:03,150
Any single observation inside the predict method has to be input in a double pair of square brackets.

47
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,140
Why is that.

48
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:10,560
That's because the British method expect from its input a two dimensional array.

49
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:16,920
And how do we create a two dimensional array with only one observation know meaning only one row.

50
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:24,480
Because what about input is a two dimensional matrix of one row and two columns where the row corresponds

51
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,630
indeed to that single customer.

52
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:33,240
And the columns correspond in fact to the features that age in the first column and salary in the second

53
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:33,960
column.

54
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,920
So there you go.

55
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,600
Now I've told you everything.

56
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:42,730
What you have to input here inside this second pair of square brackets which correspond to the columns.

57
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:48,330
Well you have to input the two values of these two features to age and the salary.

58
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:54,480
And therefore since our first customer is 30 years old and earns an estimated salary of eighty seven

59
00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:00,180
thousand dollars well the two features here that we had input in these therefore two columns here is

60
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:05,310
first 30 and then eighty seven thousand dollars.

61
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:06,080
All right.

62
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:12,370
The debt the first thing you must absolutely do you know that you must absolutely have the right reflex.

63
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:12,780
OK.

64
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:20,220
Input your single observation within a double pair of square brackets to give the expected format of

65
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:23,790
the two dimensional array to your predict method.

66
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:24,430
All right.

67
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:31,920
That was the first thing but then not enough you had to do something else which is of course to scale

68
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,030
that single observation.

69
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:34,410
Right.

70
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:41,580
Because 30 years all here and eighty seven thousand dollars as the estimated salary are in the original

71
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:48,750
scale you know before applying feature scaling standardization and since our model was actually train

72
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:55,240
as we can see on X train and Y train which were just previously feature scaled.

73
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,930
You know that's the result of feature scaling.

74
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:05,640
Well as I told you to predict methods can only be applied to observations where the features have the

75
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:09,720
exact same scale as the one that was used for the training.

76
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:15,630
And therefore here we need to apply the transport method in order to give his world break method not

77
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:19,100
only the right format here but also the right scale.

78
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:26,340
And that's why we have to transform this single observation input in the right format into that new

79
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:26,850
scale.

80
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:31,470
And so what we have to do here is take r sc objects.

81
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:37,590
Remember that was the name of the feature scaling object which we used to apply feature scaling on both

82
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:42,860
the matrix of features of the training set extreme and the matrix of features of the tested excess.

83
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:46,110
So S.E. and then remember we call.

84
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:50,100
There it is just below the transform method.

85
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:57,520
The transform method which has to take as input this whole single prediction input in a 2D array.

86
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:59,160
All right in a second one.

87
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,080
And perfect.

88
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:03,750
That was my friend's dissolution and Congratulations really.

89
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:09,370
If you got this right because you had to pay attention to two things First the right format added to

90
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:13,730
the array here for your input and then transforming that input.

91
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:17,760
You know those features to get the right scale for your break method.

92
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:18,870
Okay perfect.

93
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:24,770
So now we're actually ready to run this but we'll actually get a better output you know a nicer one

94
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:28,130
if we put all this into a print.

95
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:36,530
Print that output of the brick method and now let us press play and remember let's see if our classifier

96
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:42,650
manages to predict the right outcome meaning the right Bridge's decision which according to the test

97
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:48,950
set which contains the real result is zero meaning that first customer of age 30 an eighty seven thousand

98
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:53,130
dollars estimated salary doesn't buy that new SUV.

99
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:58,360
Okay so let's press play and let's see if it is 0 and great it is 0 4.

100
00:06:58,370 --> 00:06:59,260
Good job.

101
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:04,640
Our moral did amazing here on this single observation single customer.

102
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,060
Great.

103
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:10,670
So now we're gonna move on to the next step which will be to predict the test results so that I'm sure

104
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:12,300
you know exactly how to do.

105
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:17,060
Just make sure to figure out if you need to apply feature Skilling or not and you will get to the right

106
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,080
solution.

107
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:23,810
Also I would like you to please display you know the vector of predictions you know the vector of predicted

108
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:29,360
bridges decisions for the test set and the vector of the real purchase decisions of the same test sit

109
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:34,510
next to each other and you don't have to figure out how to implement that again.

110
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,280
Remember I want you to be efficient.

111
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:42,890
So I encourage you to take that little piece of code we made in many of the regression models to display

112
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:44,150
this efficiently.

113
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:47,030
And that's exactly what we'll do together in the next material.

114
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:48,950
So until then enjoy machine learning.
