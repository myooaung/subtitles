1

00:00:02,220  -->  00:00:08,450
Here I've got a confusion matrix and this confusion matrix has 10000 records in it and it represents

2

00:00:08,460  -->  00:00:14,430
scenario number one which we'll be looking at as you can see this model has made 150 type 1 errors and

3

00:00:14,430  -->  00:00:15,670
50 type 2 errors.

4

00:00:15,870  -->  00:00:19,090
And but overall it's predicted quite a lot correctly.

5

00:00:19,110  -->  00:00:24,650
Now let's calculate the accuracy rate in this scenario the accuracy rate is the total correct word.

6

00:00:24,660  -->  00:00:29,890
But overall total and it's 9800 divided by 10000 which is 90 percent.

7

00:00:30,270  -->  00:00:35,940
Okay great but what are we going to do now is we're going to tell the model to stop making predictions

8

00:00:35,970  -->  00:00:38,870
whatsoever which is going to abandon them all completely.

9

00:00:39,090  -->  00:00:42,550
And we're going to say that from now on our prediction is always zero.

10

00:00:42,570  -->  00:00:46,300
We're always going to predict that the event is not going to occur.

11

00:00:46,500  -->  00:00:51,180
So basically what will happen to the confusion matrix is these records will move from the right call

12

00:00:51,180  -->  00:00:55,180
them to the left column and our new confusion matrix will look like this.

13

00:00:55,260  -->  00:01:02,070
Nine thousand eight hundred fifty 150 and then nothing in the predicted column where we predicted that

14

00:01:02,070  -->  00:01:03,370
something will occur.

15

00:01:03,750  -->  00:01:05,910
And of course that moves against all logic right.

16

00:01:05,910  -->  00:01:10,800
Why would you abandon a model but let's calculate the accuracy rate in this scenario.

17

00:01:10,970  -->  00:01:15,410
So in order to accuracy rate has the same formula in this case accuracy rate is nine thousand eight

18

00:01:15,410  -->  00:01:18,310
hundred fifty divided by 10000.

19

00:01:18,360  -->  00:01:24,060
So it's ninety eight and a half percent the accuracy rate went up by half a percent.

20

00:01:24,480  -->  00:01:30,390
And as you can see what we did is we just completely stopped using a model but the accuracy rate went

21

00:01:30,450  -->  00:01:31,020
up.

22

00:01:31,230  -->  00:01:39,630
And that is why you should not base your judgment just on accuracy right because things like this can

23

00:01:39,630  -->  00:01:47,190
happen and even though obviously you're not using a model any more which means that you're not applying

24

00:01:47,190  -->  00:01:53,880
any kind of logic into your decision making process your accuracy rate is going up so it's misleading

25

00:01:53,880  -->  00:02:00,780
you into a wrong conclusion that you should stop using models and this effect is called the accuracy

26

00:02:00,780  -->  00:02:01,550
paradox.

27

00:02:01,710  -->  00:02:07,070
And starting from the next tutorial I will show you a much better way to assess your models using the

28

00:02:07,080  -->  00:02:10,670
cumulative accuracy profile of forcing you then.

29

00:02:10,680  -->  00:02:12,840
Until next time happy analyzing
