00:00:00,810  -->  00:00:05,640
Hello and welcome back to the course of machine learning to do it talking about Bayes Theorem.

2

00:00:05,730  -->  00:00:10,240
Now our main goal for this section is naive and base classifiers.

3

00:00:10,380  -->  00:00:14,880
But at the same time we can proceed to them before talking about base there and that's why we're going

4

00:00:14,880  -->  00:00:18,340
to have this lovely tutorial devoted specifically to this topic.

5

00:00:18,540  -->  00:00:21,210
So let's kick it off and get straight into it.

6

00:00:21,210  -->  00:00:23,700
Today we're talking about spanners.

7

00:00:23,760  -->  00:00:25,440
I know it's a bit weird.

8

00:00:25,480  -->  00:00:30,060
We're always talking about spanners we're supposed to talk about Bayes Theorem but I'm going to be illustrating

9

00:00:30,180  -->  00:00:31,700
the Bayes theorem on an example.

10

00:00:31,710  -->  00:00:38,070
And we're going to be using spanners just because it's one of the things I found on the Internet.

11

00:00:38,160  -->  00:00:42,750
One of the first pictures that came to mind and also that way you'll always remember whenever somebody

12

00:00:42,750  -->  00:00:46,740
says Bayes Theorem you'll remember spanner and you'll remember what we talked about today so it's a

13

00:00:46,740  -->  00:00:49,490
good way to anchor this into your memory.

14

00:00:49,500  -->  00:00:49,800
All right.

15

00:00:49,800  -->  00:00:51,560
So let's say we're in a factory.

16

00:00:51,690  -->  00:00:56,530
We're doing some analytics for a factory and there's two machines and one machine produces spanners

17

00:00:56,880  -->  00:00:59,190
and the other machine produces spanners.

18

00:00:59,190  -->  00:01:04,140
Now the machines work at different rates and they have somewhat different characteristics but overall

19

00:01:04,140  -->  00:01:05,880
they're producing the same spanners.

20

00:01:06,030  -->  00:01:11,000
The additional information here is that the spanners are actually marked or tagged.

21

00:01:11,010  -->  00:01:14,180
So we know which machine they came from so the top ones came from machine one.

22

00:01:14,370  -->  00:01:15,880
The bottom ones came from machine 2.

23

00:01:16,080  -->  00:01:22,030
And then at the end of the day we've got a whole pile of these spanners and the workers go through them

24

00:01:22,040  -->  00:01:22,080
.

25

00:01:22,110  -->  00:01:27,780
And their goal is to pick out the defective spanners here we can see that there's a couple of defective

26

00:01:27,780  -->  00:01:30,280
spanners hiding among the pile.

27

00:01:30,280  -->  00:01:33,800
Now the question we're going to be asking today is what's the probability.

28

00:01:33,810  -->  00:01:39,510
What's the probability of machine to producing a defective spanner.

29

00:01:39,510  -->  00:01:45,210
So if you take just a random spanner and produced by machine two so as it comes out of the from the

30

00:01:45,210  -->  00:01:46,830
conveyor belt you pick it up.

31

00:01:46,830  -->  00:01:49,530
What is the probability that that spanner is defective.

32

00:01:49,800  -->  00:01:55,110
And the way we'll get operability is through some information that will already be given to us at the

33

00:01:55,110  -->  00:01:55,590
start.

34

00:01:55,770  -->  00:01:57,710
So we'll have a look at that information in a second.

35

00:01:57,720  -->  00:02:04,950
But the rule or the mathematical concept that I'll be using to get that probability is called the Bayes

36

00:02:05,010  -->  00:02:05,490
Theorem.

37

00:02:05,610  -->  00:02:07,710
Here's a mathematical representation of it.

38

00:02:07,710  -->  00:02:13,160
I know it is a bit complicated right now it seems like what are all these signs like we know that is

39

00:02:13,170  -->  00:02:19,350
probably probability but then be a vertical line what would all the all of them doing here what is this

40

00:02:19,350  -->  00:02:20,820
relationship telling us.

41

00:02:20,820  -->  00:02:22,230
Well don't worry about it for now.

42

00:02:22,230  -->  00:02:23,890
We will walk through it.

43

00:02:23,950  -->  00:02:29,240
Very slowly step by step and you'll get to know the base theorem very intimately.

44

00:02:29,460  -->  00:02:29,750
All right.

45

00:02:29,760  -->  00:02:30,880
So let's get started.

46

00:02:31,050  -->  00:02:34,630
What is the information that is provided to us at the very soon.

47

00:02:34,890  -->  00:02:38,650
Well we know that machine 1 produces 30 or inches per hour.

48

00:02:38,690  -->  00:02:40,590
Admission to 24 inches per hour.

49

00:02:40,680  -->  00:02:45,600
By the way trenches and spanners I found out just now that they're actually the same thing.

50

00:02:45,600  -->  00:02:47,760
A spanner is outside of North America.

51

00:02:47,770  -->  00:02:49,820
A wrench is inside of North America.

52

00:02:49,920  -->  00:02:53,400
So there you go you learn an extra additional thing today if you didn't know that.

53

00:02:53,400  -->  00:02:55,280
I learned an excellent additional thing.

54

00:02:55,320  -->  00:02:58,240
So we're was going to call them wrenches from now machine.

55

00:02:58,320  -->  00:03:02,000
One produces 30 wrenches machine to pieces 20 inches per hour.

56

00:03:02,070  -->  00:03:03,240
OK great.

57

00:03:03,300  -->  00:03:08,470
Also out of all of the produced parts we can see that 1 percent are defective.

58

00:03:08,490  -->  00:03:13,340
So after checking the parts that then they are thousands and thousands of branches we can see that 1

59

00:03:13,350  -->  00:03:14,670
percent of them are defective.

60

00:03:14,760  -->  00:03:15,210
OK.

61

00:03:15,240  -->  00:03:21,660
So we know that they also know that out of all of the defective parts we can see that 50 percent came

62

00:03:21,660  -->  00:03:24,730
from machine 1 and 50 percent came from machine too.

63

00:03:24,930  -->  00:03:32,280
So here you can see that if you take all the defective parts or only the defective parts and you calculate

64

00:03:32,340  -->  00:03:36,010
how many of them came from machine one and how many of them came from machine to.

65

00:03:36,060  -->  00:03:41,010
You'll see that half and half that half of them are for machine one and half from from Washington.

66

00:03:41,430  -->  00:03:42,150
All right.

67

00:03:42,150  -->  00:03:44,030
So this is just the defective parts.

68

00:03:44,190  -->  00:03:50,330
And the question is what is the probability that that apart produced permission to is defective.

69

00:03:50,340  -->  00:03:54,570
So that's the same question which we assess really what is the probability that if I come on two machine

70

00:03:54,570  -->  00:03:59,820
two and take the part that just popped out of Mushin to what is the probability that that part is going

71

00:03:59,820  -->  00:04:00,620
to be defective.

72

00:04:00,780  -->  00:04:04,470
So how do we put all that information together to get the answer to this question.

73

00:04:04,470  -->  00:04:07,740
That's what Bayes Theorem answers or helps us do.

74

00:04:08,040  -->  00:04:12,630
So let's have a look at how we can rewrite this information in more mathematical terms.

75

00:04:12,660  -->  00:04:17,810
So the first line what does it tell us it tells us that machine one inches per hour machine to 20 or

76

00:04:17,880  -->  00:04:23,570
inches per hour so in total out of all the range produced there is 50 ranch's produced per hour.

77

00:04:23,670  -->  00:04:29,610
And also that means that the probability of any given range that you pick up from the pile just aini

78

00:04:29,610  -->  00:04:34,470
whether it's effective or non-defective if you pick up a wrench from the final pile the probability

79

00:04:34,470  -->  00:04:38,090
that will come from machine 1 is 30 divided by 50 right.

80

00:04:38,160  -->  00:04:44,640
So if we're producing sutee from machine 1 and 50 overall per hour that means likelihood of any given

81

00:04:44,640  -->  00:04:53,550
range to be from machine 1 is about is exactly 30 divided by 50 or 0.6 or 60 percent Similarly the likelihood

82

00:04:53,620  -->  00:04:57,800
of that range being from machine to is 20 or 30 or 40 percent.

83

00:04:57,810  -->  00:04:58,050
All right.

84

00:04:58,060  -->  00:04:58,350
Great.

85

00:04:58,360  -->  00:05:00,670
So we're going to write those down and keep them there for now.

86

00:05:00,670  -->  00:05:05,220
Now let's see what we can get out of the second line so we can see that out of all the produce parts

87

00:05:05,230  -->  00:05:06,990
we can see that one person a defect.

88

00:05:06,990  -->  00:05:11,560
Well it's very simple to write this in mathematical terms or can just say possibility of a part being

89

00:05:11,560  -->  00:05:13,120
defective equals 1 percent.

90

00:05:13,180  -->  00:05:15,680
So so even though that was a simple transition.

91

00:05:15,750  -->  00:05:18,470
Actually these sentences are saying a bit different thing.

92

00:05:18,480  -->  00:05:24,270
So the one on the left says we can see that 1 percent are defective so that means that we took we counted

93

00:05:24,270  -->  00:05:27,400
the number of defective parts and we divided by the total amount.

94

00:05:27,490  -->  00:05:33,700
And that means that 1 percent effective on the right is saying the probability of a single part to be

95

00:05:33,690  -->  00:05:34,680
defective with 1 percent.

96

00:05:34,690  -->  00:05:40,890
So that means if I pick up a random part from the pile the likelihood of it being defective is 1 percent

97

00:05:40,890  -->  00:05:41,230
.

98

00:05:41,380  -->  00:05:41,830
Right.

99

00:05:41,980  -->  00:05:44,420
So that is what we're saying here.

100

00:05:44,440  -->  00:05:50,050
And here's a very simple thing to write in methodical terms there it is defective or that there's a

101

00:05:50,050  -->  00:05:51,980
defect equals 1 percent.

102

00:05:52,080  -->  00:05:54,580
All right and now we're moving on to part three.

103

00:05:54,630  -->  00:06:02,620
Out of all of the defects of parts we can see that 50 percent came from machine 1 and 50 percent came

104

00:06:02,620  -->  00:06:03,500
from machine to.

105

00:06:03,550  -->  00:06:07,230
So how do we write that in mathematical terms and this is just about.

106

00:06:07,410  -->  00:06:09,920
So let's start with the machine one part.

107

00:06:10,140  -->  00:06:11,650
50 percent came from machine one.

108

00:06:11,660  -->  00:06:18,040
Meaning that if we take only the defective part so if it's given that we're only looking at the defective

109

00:06:18,030  -->  00:06:24,520
parts then the likelihood that any part of that we pick out that that part came from machine 1 is 50

110

00:06:24,510  -->  00:06:24,810
percent.

111

00:06:24,850  -->  00:06:31,560
And the way through in mathematical terms is this way of machine one vertical line defect equals 50

112

00:06:31,560  -->  00:06:31,950
percent.

113

00:06:32,070  -->  00:06:36,830
So the right part of it here the vertical line in mathematical terms means given.

114

00:06:36,900  -->  00:06:43,150
So here is the P of part pure of machine 1 is the likelihood operability of a part coming from machine

115

00:06:43,140  -->  00:06:44,210
1 here.

116

00:06:44,230  -->  00:06:45,780
It's same thing.

117

00:06:45,980  -->  00:06:47,920
But given some condition.

118

00:06:47,910  -->  00:06:55,760
So this is the likelihood of a part coming from machine one given the condition that that part is defective

119

00:06:55,750  -->  00:06:55,770
.

120

00:06:55,770  -->  00:07:02,550
So you know priori that that part is defective because you're picking it out of the defective pile.

121

00:07:02,560  -->  00:07:06,100
So what is the probability of that part coming from machine 1.

122

00:07:06,310  -->  00:07:11,280
Well it's 50 percent and that is the mathematical transcription of this sentence.

123

00:07:11,280  -->  00:07:13,770
We can see that 50 percent came from machine 1.

124

00:07:13,760  -->  00:07:15,550
50 percent of defective parts.

125

00:07:15,840  -->  00:07:19,080
OK so now is the same thing for the machine machine too.

126

00:07:19,160  -->  00:07:21,900
It's going to look exactly the same but here is going to be machine 2.

127

00:07:21,930  -->  00:07:28,470
So probability of a part that the part that we just picked up the billy ray originally was created by

128

00:07:28,480  -->  00:07:30,840
machine 2 is 50 percent.

129

00:07:30,850  -->  00:07:34,690
Given that we're only peeking out from the defective pile.

130

00:07:34,750  -->  00:07:35,090
Right.

131

00:07:35,190  -->  00:07:38,330
Because if we're picking out of our all of them it's actually 40 percent.

132

00:07:38,360  -->  00:07:39,390
It's 0.4.

133

00:07:39,510  -->  00:07:43,390
But if we're picking it out only from the defective file it's 50 percent.

134

00:07:43,380  -->  00:07:49,230
So you can really tell from here from these two expressions are four expressions that the likelihood

135

00:07:49,320  -->  00:07:53,430
of a POD come from machine to is 40 percent meaning that it produces less.

136

00:07:53,440  -->  00:08:00,930
It produces less wrenches whereas the likelihood of a defective part coming from machine to is 50 percent

137

00:08:00,940  -->  00:08:06,340
so that if you take any part or any branch you pick it out from the defective pilot the likelihood that

138

00:08:06,340  -->  00:08:08,250
it was originally produced by machine is 50 percent.

139

00:08:08,280  -->  00:08:14,550
So you can tell right away that machine too seems to be producing disproportionately more defective

140

00:08:14,560  -->  00:08:16,040
parts than machine one.

141

00:08:16,060  -->  00:08:16,290
Right.

142

00:08:16,290  -->  00:08:20,860
So it's only producing 40 percent of the output but it's accounting for 50 percent of the defective

143

00:08:20,860  -->  00:08:21,400
parts.

144

00:08:21,630  -->  00:08:24,400
And the question that we want to ask is actually a bit different.

145

00:08:24,390  -->  00:08:24,610
Right.

146

00:08:24,610  -->  00:08:29,910
So the question to ask is What is the probability that a part produced by machine 2 is defective.

147

00:08:29,910  -->  00:08:32,390
So here it's kind of reverse here.

148

00:08:32,670  -->  00:08:36,720
First we're saying we're taking a part from machine to right.

149

00:08:36,730  -->  00:08:42,040
We're only looking at parts that are produced by machine to what is the probability of a random part

150

00:08:42,100  -->  00:08:44,250
taking out a machine to be defective.

151

00:08:44,400  -->  00:08:47,050
How do we write that in mathematical terms.

152

00:08:47,160  -->  00:08:53,210
It's written this way so probability of a defective part given that it came from machine to.

153

00:08:53,230  -->  00:08:56,480
If you look at just the probability of a car being defective it's 1 percent.

154

00:08:56,560  -->  00:08:59,430
But here we are given a condition that is machine 2.

155

00:08:59,620  -->  00:09:04,060
So the way to think of it you can think of it as parts of coming out of machine too and you just pick

156

00:09:04,060  -->  00:09:06,660
up a random one was the probability of it being defective right.

157

00:09:06,850  -->  00:09:08,970
Or you can think of it in terms of quantities.

158

00:09:08,980  -->  00:09:14,530
The correct term here is frequentist interpretation so you can think of it in terms of the frequentist

159

00:09:14,520  -->  00:09:15,480
interpretation.

160

00:09:15,490  -->  00:09:19,430
And that means instead of just picking up one part and thinking about what.

161

00:09:19,540  -->  00:09:24,840
So what is the likelihood of it being defective if we know that it came from Ashin to think of it as

162

00:09:25,050  -->  00:09:31,030
there's a pile of wrenches that only came from machine to so you have a pile of you know a thousand

163

00:09:31,020  -->  00:09:36,510
wrenches that came for machine to what is the number of wrenches that are going to be defect.

164

00:09:36,520  -->  00:09:40,150
Right so what is a portion of branches that are going to be defective.

165

00:09:40,150  -->  00:09:45,600
So those are two different ways of thinking about probabilities and or the Bayes Theorem but they pretty

166

00:09:45,610  -->  00:09:49,710
much the same thing exactly the same thing just different ways of thinking about it.

167

00:09:49,710  -->  00:09:54,660
So it's either What's the probability of this one part that just came out of machine to being defective

168

00:09:54,900  -->  00:09:59,770
or what is the portion of all of these pars that came out of a machine to what is a portion of them

169

00:09:59,760  -->  00:10:00,490
that's going to be defect.

170

00:10:01,110  -->  00:10:02,910
So that's the question that we want to answer.

171

00:10:02,900  -->  00:10:04,910
And given all this information.

172

00:10:05,000  -->  00:10:10,850
All right so let's start solving this problem and will illustrate how the Bayes theorem will help us

173

00:10:11,030  -->  00:10:14,060
convert this information to this information.

174

00:10:14,060  -->  00:10:14,390
All right.

175

00:10:14,390  -->  00:10:20,840
So first of all we won't need the ability for machine 1 and the ability for machine 1 given defective

176

00:10:20,840  -->  00:10:25,730
so we're going to get rid of that out of our information just to clean things up.

177

00:10:25,800  -->  00:10:31,130
Now let's just move everything slide everything over to make some space and not just write down the

178

00:10:31,130  -->  00:10:36,890
Bayes Theorem which we had a brief look at before and based theorem for this particular problem will

179

00:10:36,890  -->  00:10:38,490
look as follows.

180

00:10:38,690  -->  00:10:42,180
So the probability of a defective part.

181

00:10:42,200  -->  00:10:48,770
Given that it came from machine to probability of a parred being defective given that that part that

182

00:10:48,820  -->  00:10:54,410
that wrench came from machine to equals and here we go this is the fun part.

183

00:10:54,410  -->  00:10:59,840
So you will take the proverbial star from right to left it will take the probability of a part being

184

00:10:59,850  -->  00:11:00,490
defective.

185

00:11:00,530  -->  00:11:08,520
Overall we will need to multiply that by the probability that a part came from machine to.

186

00:11:08,570  -->  00:11:15,720
Given that it was defective and we need to divide that by the probability of the parts coming from machine

187

00:11:15,750  -->  00:11:16,440
to.

188

00:11:16,520  -->  00:11:16,770
All right.

189

00:11:16,760  -->  00:11:21,260
So for now this might seem a bit better already than we saw previously at least.

190

00:11:21,250  -->  00:11:25,700
Now we we can read these terms right and we know how we got them here.

191

00:11:25,700  -->  00:11:31,280
So we actually discussed each one of these terms and they're pretty straightforward even though even

192

00:11:31,280  -->  00:11:36,680
though the mathematical representation might look a bit scary at the same time they're pretty straightforward

193

00:11:36,680  -->  00:11:38,910
terms we know what we're talking about.

194

00:11:38,900  -->  00:11:44,430
At the same time we don't really understand where this formula came from and more importantly an intuitive

195

00:11:44,420  -->  00:11:46,530
level doesn't really make sense at this stage.

196

00:11:46,620  -->  00:11:52,430
But Sergei let's for now plug in the numbers and then we'll proceed to the intuitive part of this format

197

00:11:52,440  -->  00:11:52,640
.

198

00:11:52,790  -->  00:11:56,200
So if we plug in the numbers we will get is 0.5.

199

00:11:56,270  -->  00:12:01,190
So we'll just take numbers from the top or if we start from right to left again the probability of a

200

00:12:01,190  -->  00:12:08,860
par being defective overall is 1 percent multiplied by probability of a part coming from machine 2.

201

00:12:08,880  -->  00:12:15,680
Given that we're only looking at defective parts or given that that part is known to be defective it's

202

00:12:15,680  -->  00:12:16,240
50 percent.

203

00:12:16,250  -->  00:12:17,090
So there it is.

204

00:12:17,370  -->  00:12:23,930
And we're dividing that by the probability of the part coming from machine to overall and that is 40

205

00:12:23,930  -->  00:12:24,310
percent.

206

00:12:24,440  -->  00:12:33,080
So it goes over like that and we get a 0.0 4:59 so one and a quarter percentage is a one point twenty

207

00:12:33,090  -->  00:12:38,580
five percent is the probability that machine two will spit out a defective part.

208

00:12:38,610  -->  00:12:38,850
Right.

209

00:12:38,880  -->  00:12:45,140
If you come up to machine 2 and you pick up my part then the probability of that part being defective

210

00:12:45,140  -->  00:12:52,340
is one point twenty five percent or the frequentist interpretation is if machine to produced 1000 parts

211

00:12:52,640  -->  00:12:54,820
then according to Bayes Theorem.

212

00:12:55,070  -->  00:13:01,340
And a half of them will be defective so you can really say 12 and a half ranch's will be defective so

213

00:13:01,350  -->  00:13:08,250
let's say it produced 10000 parts then the base theorem tells us that 125 of those wrenches are going

214

00:13:08,250  -->  00:13:09,190
to be defective.

215

00:13:09,230  -->  00:13:15,000
So as you can see we convert all this information that we knew about the process and about the results

216

00:13:15,000  -->  00:13:17,410
of the process into exactly what we want.

217

00:13:17,420  -->  00:13:20,230
Now let's move on to the intuition the fun stuff right.

218

00:13:20,250  -->  00:13:24,420
So with this one point twenty five and so let's move this to the top.

219

00:13:24,470  -->  00:13:25,670
That's our base theorem.

220

00:13:25,670  -->  00:13:30,990
And let's look at an example and you'll see that it's actually very very intuitive what we just did

221

00:13:30,980  -->  00:13:32,440
it all makes total sense.

222

00:13:32,720  -->  00:13:37,100
So let's look an example let's say we produced a thousand ranges all total.

223

00:13:37,110  -->  00:13:42,800
So in total we have a thousand wrenches after the two machines were working for some time.

224

00:13:43,190  -->  00:13:46,780
So we know that 400 of them came from machine to.

225

00:13:46,790  -->  00:13:47,060
Right.

226

00:13:47,060  -->  00:13:54,020
So we know that machine 2 produces homier inches per hour does it PRI's produces 20 or inches per hour

227

00:13:54,040  -->  00:13:54,220
.

228

00:13:54,410  -->  00:13:58,690
And machine one produces 30 or inches per hour as per hour.

229

00:13:58,710  -->  00:14:00,340
Get information from the very start.

230

00:14:00,440  -->  00:14:05,960
And that means that out of the thousand wrenches 40 percent will be it would have been produced by machine

231

00:14:05,960  -->  00:14:08,050
2 that means 400 came from machine.

232

00:14:08,090  -->  00:14:08,360
OK.

233

00:14:08,370  -->  00:14:09,890
So that makes sense.

234

00:14:10,110  -->  00:14:13,000
Then we also know that 1 percent have a defect.

235

00:14:13,010  -->  00:14:14,640
We actually see this.

236

00:14:14,690  -->  00:14:18,850
The workers who look at the wrenches at the end of the day this is also given to us.

237

00:14:18,950  -->  00:14:24,290
They see that 1 percent of a defect and that means out of thousand one percent is tenths of 10 wrenches

238

00:14:24,290  -->  00:14:25,040
have a defect.

239

00:14:25,210  -->  00:14:26,340
Okay great.

240

00:14:26,340  -->  00:14:31,850
And so what's the next step next step is that we know that 50 percent of those 10 came from Mission

241

00:14:31,860  -->  00:14:32,320
2.

242

00:14:32,450  -->  00:14:38,260
So we know that exactly five of those defective wrenches came from machine to that is also given to

243

00:14:38,270  -->  00:14:44,820
us because those defect wrenches actually have labels on them and we can tell by the labels labels that

244

00:14:44,900  -->  00:14:46,660
five of them came from machine to.

245

00:14:46,720  -->  00:14:47,050
All right.

246

00:14:47,050  -->  00:14:51,590
So the question is what is the percent effective parts from machine to.

247

00:14:51,730  -->  00:14:56,680
Well it's very easy now right because we know that how many defective actually came from machine to

248

00:14:56,680  -->  00:14:57,500
five.

249

00:14:57,700  -->  00:15:01,740
And we know how many wrenches came from machine to 400.

250

00:15:01,780  -->  00:15:08,050
Right so all we have to do is divide 5 by 400 and we'll get one point twenty five bytes we get the same

251

00:15:08,050  -->  00:15:08,620
answer.

252

00:15:08,710  -->  00:15:10,650
Not only do we get the same answer.

253

00:15:10,780  -->  00:15:13,380
We actually did exactly the same process.

254

00:15:13,390  -->  00:15:17,500
If you think through what we did here we perform exactly the same process.

255

00:15:17,620  -->  00:15:19,650
We had a thousand wrenches right.

256

00:15:19,810  -->  00:15:26,860
And then we turned that into 400 so we multiplied a thousand wrenches by 40 percent which is the probability

257

00:15:26,860  -->  00:15:28,210
of a part time machine too.

258

00:15:28,210  -->  00:15:30,160
So this is our denominator.

259

00:15:30,160  -->  00:15:30,400
Right.

260

00:15:30,400  -->  00:15:37,240
So instead of probing the machine to what we have what we just did this 400 is P of machine 2 times

261

00:15:37,250  -->  00:15:41,740
1000 right so we have machine two times a thousand in the denominator.

262

00:15:41,820  -->  00:15:44,590
I sort of just piece of machine in what we're doing here.

263

00:15:44,590  -->  00:15:44,860
Right.

264

00:15:44,860  -->  00:15:48,080
And then one percent have a defect and that means 10.

265

00:15:48,100  -->  00:15:49,780
So where did this 10 come from.

266

00:15:49,780  -->  00:15:51,700
That's 1 percent times a thousand.

267

00:15:51,700  -->  00:15:57,530
So instead of pede defect at the top we actually have the defect times 1000 right now.

268

00:15:57,670  -->  00:15:59,650
So just visualize that for a second.

269

00:15:59,650  -->  00:16:06,250
So instead of permission to have permission two times a thousand defect times a thousand.

270

00:16:06,490  -->  00:16:12,850
And then this 50 percent the possibility of them of them 50 percent came from machine to right equals

271

00:16:12,850  -->  00:16:13,390
five.

272

00:16:13,420  -->  00:16:17,430
That's the last line is actually us performing this operation here.

273

00:16:17,530  -->  00:16:22,840
We're saying the probability of card coming from machine to given that it's defective is 50 percent

274

00:16:22,840  -->  00:16:22,870
.

275

00:16:22,870  -->  00:16:26,710
So basically to get to this what we did is we took this part.

276

00:16:26,740  -->  00:16:28,470
So we took 50 percent.

277

00:16:28,490  -->  00:16:32,230
Multiply that by the 10 which is actually.

278

00:16:32,530  -->  00:16:35,710
So 50 percent multiplied by 1 percent.

279

00:16:35,710  -->  00:16:36,610
Times 1000.

280

00:16:36,610  -->  00:16:43,960
So here we've got extra time thousand and here we've got the machine to what we did is we actually put

281

00:16:43,960  -->  00:16:45,960
in motion two times a thousand.

282

00:16:45,970  -->  00:16:51,080
So we just aggregate an extra part over here times 1000 and Pardoe here 10000.

283

00:16:51,220  -->  00:16:56,320
And then we still divided that final result that five that we got by the 400 that we got.

284

00:16:56,320  -->  00:17:01,510
So the logical steps that we took are exactly the same as the Bayes Theorem.

285

00:17:01,570  -->  00:17:05,620
The only difference is that we looked at a specific example of the thousand ranges.

286

00:17:05,650  -->  00:17:11,890
So as you can see the Bayes Theorem is a very intuitive theorem so we're not even going to go into the

287

00:17:11,890  -->  00:17:13,630
mathematics of how it's derived.

288

00:17:13,630  -->  00:17:20,050
This is about understanding it intuitively so as long as you remember the mathematical representation

289

00:17:20,050  -->  00:17:24,380
of the base theorem it actually makes sense what it is helping us calculate it.

290

00:17:24,400  -->  00:17:29,950
And in the steps that it is implied for us to take to calculate the final result.

291

00:17:30,250  -->  00:17:30,760
So there we go.

292

00:17:30,760  -->  00:17:35,650
Hopefully that all makes sense and we only have one final question left.

293

00:17:35,650  -->  00:17:38,110
We only have one obvious question here.

294

00:17:38,110  -->  00:17:42,100
So the question is why do we have to go through all this complexity.

295

00:17:42,130  -->  00:17:44,110
Why do we have to go through all this complexity.

296

00:17:44,110  -->  00:17:50,200
Why don't we just count the number of defective wrenches from machine to and then count the number of

297

00:17:50,200  -->  00:17:55,070
total wrenches that came from machine to and divide one by the other and get that same result.

298

00:17:55,090  -->  00:17:56,110
Why can't we just do that.

299

00:17:56,110  -->  00:18:01,180
Why don't we have that input of the total number of wrenches that came from machine to right away.

300

00:18:01,180  -->  00:18:07,570
So that's a question if the items are labeled Why couldn't we just count the number of defective wrenches

301

00:18:07,570  -->  00:18:11,230
that came from machine to and divide by the total number that came from Washington.

302

00:18:11,410  -->  00:18:16,410
So if you think about it that's exactly what we are doing so we are dividing the total number of.

303

00:18:16,420  -->  00:18:20,230
So this is the total number of branches that came from machine to at the top.

304

00:18:20,260  -->  00:18:26,490
If you multiply by the thousand at the top we've got the number of machine to add or so defective the

305

00:18:26,600  -->  00:18:31,090
ability of a part for mission to see if it's given as effective tumbril really would be perfect.

306

00:18:31,090  -->  00:18:37,810
So at the top as you remember we've got that five so the top is actually the number of defective parts

307

00:18:38,260  -->  00:18:43,270
that came from machine to at the end of the day we were actually doing that exact thing.

308

00:18:43,270  -->  00:18:45,220
The question is what can we do it right away.

309

00:18:45,220  -->  00:18:50,620
Why couldn't the workers just go and count the number of defective parts that came from machine to and

310

00:18:50,620  -->  00:18:52,400
divided by the number of parts.

311

00:18:52,570  -->  00:18:55,230
That's the overall number of parts that came from wishing to.

312

00:18:55,240  -->  00:18:56,380
Why not save some time.

313

00:18:56,650  -->  00:18:59,200
Well the answer to that question can can be multifold.

314

00:18:59,200  -->  00:19:05,260
First of all it might be very time consuming like in this example Zabol might be time consuming to calculate

315

00:19:05,350  -->  00:19:10,870
the number of wrenches that just came from machine to for instance we might know it might be like a

316

00:19:10,870  -->  00:19:15,820
standard metric that the factory measures how many wrenches produced overall.

317

00:19:15,820  -->  00:19:21,280
Right so we know that number 8000 or maybe 100000 but to count them permission to add might take them

318

00:19:21,280  -->  00:19:25,780
some time to sit and can through those wrenches in there for just fossil fuel based.

319

00:19:25,930  -->  00:19:29,620
The other thing here is that sometimes you might not have access to that information.

320

00:19:29,620  -->  00:19:35,350
Sometimes the problem might be such that you just cannot perform that and you have some inputs like

321

00:19:35,350  -->  00:19:36,930
we had in this case and that's it.

322

00:19:37,030  -->  00:19:42,370
And it's not as simple as in this example and therefore you just don't have access to that information

323

00:19:42,390  -->  00:19:42,720
.

324

00:19:43,030  -->  00:19:48,220
So there are numerous reasons why you could be in a situation where you can't just go through the straightforward

325

00:19:48,250  -->  00:19:52,040
easy obvious way and you need to base their base for them.

326

00:19:52,180  -->  00:19:56,250
So therefore it's a useful thing to have in your science arsenal.

327

00:19:56,470  -->  00:20:02,410
And moreover now that we know Bayes Theorem we can proceed to the naive base classifiers and to finish

328

00:20:02,410  -->  00:20:07,480
off terrestrial I've got a quick exercise for you perform the same calculational similar calculations

329

00:20:07,480  -->  00:20:14,400
for this value that we use to calculate what is the probability of a part being defective.

330

00:20:14,680  -->  00:20:17,020
Given that it came from machine 1.

331

00:20:17,260  -->  00:20:18,160
So there you go.

332

00:20:18,190  -->  00:20:21,510
It's a handy Couhig says this to solidify this knowledge.

333

00:20:21,640  -->  00:20:25,360
And I look for an external until then in Germany in learning
