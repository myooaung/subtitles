1

00:00:01,070  -->  00:00:04,120
Improves the Tauriel we talked about the accuracy paradox.

2

00:00:04,200  -->  00:00:11,070
Hopefully now you see why we need more robust methods to assess how models and we talk about the cumulative

3

00:00:11,070  -->  00:00:15,330
accuracy profile which is in fact one of those methods.

4

00:00:15,390  -->  00:00:16,420
Let's look at a scenario.

5

00:00:16,560  -->  00:00:24,180
Let's say you're a scientist at a store which sells clothes and your store has a total of 100000 customers

6

00:00:24,180  -->  00:00:24,250
.

7

00:00:24,270  -->  00:00:27,940
I'm placing that number on the horizontal axis.

8

00:00:28,200  -->  00:00:35,130
And you know that from experience whenever you send an offer like an e-mail to all your customers or

9

00:00:35,130  -->  00:00:41,190
to any random sample of your customers approximately 10 percent of them respond and purchase the product

10

00:00:41,210  -->  00:00:41,420
.

11

00:00:41,610  -->  00:00:48,280
So I'm going to place 10000 which is 10 percent of the total on the vertical axis.

12

00:00:48,450  -->  00:00:57,060
And so what we're going to do is where we've got an offer that we want to send and we want to see how

13

00:00:57,060  -->  00:00:59,360
many customers are going to purchase our product.

14

00:00:59,370  -->  00:01:06,270
We send it off so if we send it to zero customers obviously will get zero responses right.

15

00:01:06,540  -->  00:01:10,020
What do you think will happen if we send it to 20000 customers.

16

00:01:10,050  -->  00:01:11,760
How many do you think will respond.

17

00:01:11,760  -->  00:01:18,140
Well because this is a random sample and we know that about 10 percent response I would say about 2000

18

00:01:18,150  -->  00:01:18,720
would respond.

19

00:01:18,720  -->  00:01:20,270
Fair enough right.

20

00:01:20,310  -->  00:01:26,440
If 40000 if we send to the offer to 40000 of our customers then about 4000 will respond.

21

00:01:26,550  -->  00:01:35,540
Sixty thousand six thousand 80000 8000 100000 than 10000 of our customers should respond.

22

00:01:35,640  -->  00:01:43,830
And this is a random selection process so here we can draw a line which will actually represent this

23

00:01:44,280  -->  00:01:52,020
random selection the slope of the line equals to that 10 percent that we know that respond on average

24

00:01:52,020  -->  00:01:55,530
to offer as if we just send them out like that.

25

00:01:55,530  -->  00:02:03,210
Now the question is can we somehow improve this experience can we get more customers to respond to offers

26

00:02:03,810  -->  00:02:12,050
when we send out our letters so basically Can we somehow target our customers more appropriately so

27

00:02:12,060  -->  00:02:14,090
to get a better response rate.

28

00:02:14,220  -->  00:02:21,720
And how about instead of sending out these offers randomly to say a random sample of 20000 customers

29

00:02:21,730  -->  00:02:21,880
.

30

00:02:21,960  -->  00:02:26,730
How would we pick and choose the customers we send these offers to and how do we pick and choose.

31

00:02:26,850  -->  00:02:32,220
Well to start off with let's build a model just like we did in the previous section.

32

00:02:32,220  -->  00:02:38,850
Basically a customer segmentation model demographic segmentation model but which wants to predict whether

33

00:02:38,850  -->  00:02:43,350
or not they will leave the company it will actually predict whether or not they will purchase the product

34

00:02:43,350  -->  00:02:43,580
.

35

00:02:43,590  -->  00:02:45,640
It's a very simple process actually.

36

00:02:45,660  -->  00:02:51,030
In fact it's the same thing because purchased is also a binary variable yes or no.

37

00:02:51,180  -->  00:02:53,090
And we can also run the same experiment.

38

00:02:53,100  -->  00:02:58,320
We can take a group of customers before we send out the offer and then look back and see who purchased

39

00:02:58,550  -->  00:02:59,930
with a male or female.

40

00:02:59,970  -->  00:03:06,960
Which country were they in what age predominantly were they were they browsing on mobile were they browsing

41

00:03:07,440  -->  00:03:14,310
via a computer and all of these factors we can take them into account measure them put them into a logistic

42

00:03:14,310  -->  00:03:21,990
regression and get a model which will help us assess the likelihood of certain types of customers purchasing

43

00:03:21,990  -->  00:03:27,780
based on their characteristics or the general demographic status and and other characteristics.

44

00:03:28,080  -->  00:03:34,860
And once we've built this model how about we apply it to select customers we will send the offer to

45

00:03:34,860  -->  00:03:35,070
.

46

00:03:35,070  -->  00:03:41,340
So what the model will tell us like just like in the example in the previous section where females of

47

00:03:41,400  -->  00:03:47,160
female customers of a bank whose favorite color is red they're most likely to leave the bag here will

48

00:03:47,160  -->  00:03:48,000
have a similar result.

49

00:03:48,030  -->  00:03:56,330
Ill say perhaps male customers in this certain age group who browse and mobile are most likely to purchase

50

00:03:56,330  -->  00:03:56,900
a product.

51

00:03:56,940  -->  00:04:03,390
It will tell us something or ill actually rank our customers we'll give them a probability of purchasing

52

00:04:03,390  -->  00:04:07,680
our product and then we can use that probability to actually contact our customers.

53

00:04:07,680  -->  00:04:11,320
So of course if we contact zero customers will get a response rate.

54

00:04:11,460  -->  00:04:16,680
Then if we contact 20000 we'll probably get a much higher response rate than just 2000 because we're

55

00:04:16,680  -->  00:04:23,400
picking out the customers that are at the highest risk of accepting this offer.

56

00:04:23,400  -->  00:04:30,180
We know from their previous behavior from the previous behavior of customers similar to them that they

57

00:04:30,180  -->  00:04:36,360
have a 90 percent chance or an 80 percent chance of purchasing this product and we will go for them

58

00:04:36,360  -->  00:04:36,950
first.

59

00:04:36,960  -->  00:04:40,120
We will put them at the top of our list of people who we contact.

60

00:04:40,320  -->  00:04:44,810
Then when we contact let's say we contact not 20000 but 40000.

61

00:04:44,910  -->  00:04:51,960
Our response rate will be higher than 4000 which we get in the random scenario if we if our model is

62

00:04:51,960  -->  00:04:58,380
really good then by the time we're at around around 60 thousand so more that just over half of our total

63

00:04:58,680  -->  00:05:06,420
customer base we are really getting to that 10000 mark so we know that 10000 people will respond in

64

00:05:06,420  -->  00:05:06,890
total.

65

00:05:06,900  -->  00:05:13,380
There's no way we can get above that because that's just the response rate if we contact everybody it'll

66

00:05:13,380  -->  00:05:15,570
be 10000 but we're getting very close already.

67

00:05:15,570  -->  00:05:20,800
So even at 60000 we're already at nine and a half thousand respondents or purchases.

68

00:05:20,900  -->  00:05:22,660
We we could actually stop here.

69

00:05:22,650  -->  00:05:28,230
We've already pretty much contacted everyone but if we want to contact more if we send it out to 80000

70

00:05:28,230  -->  00:05:31,130
we're getting even closer to 10000 responses.

71

00:05:31,260  -->  00:05:37,050
And if we contact 100000 we will still be back at our 10000 responses.

72

00:05:37,050  -->  00:05:41,320
So not this draw a line through these crosses.

73

00:05:41,400  -->  00:05:47,560
So what you see this line here is called the cumulative accuracy profile of your model.

74

00:05:47,910  -->  00:05:54,630
And as you can imagine the better your model the larger will be the the area under the slides so the

75

00:05:54,630  -->  00:05:57,420
area between the red and the blue lines.

76

00:05:57,420  -->  00:06:03,480
It will increase as your model gets better and if your model is worse then this red line will be closer

77

00:06:03,480  -->  00:06:06,600
to the blue line so it will be closer to random.

78

00:06:06,600  -->  00:06:12,280
The next step we want to do is convert these axes from absolute values to percentages.

79

00:06:12,320  -->  00:06:12,800
So.

80

00:06:12,840  -->  00:06:14,890
So they range from zero to 100 percent.

81

00:06:15,270  -->  00:06:19,980
And this is how the cap kirpan is normally represented.

82

00:06:19,980  -->  00:06:25,160
Now let's say we ran another regression model and this time we used less variables listen dependent

83

00:06:25,250  -->  00:06:31,850
variables or just because we had less access to independent variables or we didn't see that there's

84

00:06:31,890  -->  00:06:36,080
a multicollinearity effect in a model or something else that went wrong.

85

00:06:36,090  -->  00:06:39,210
And that model because it will be worse.

86

00:06:39,450  -->  00:06:42,120
This is what it's kept curve look like.

87

00:06:42,300  -->  00:06:47,400
And therefore by plotting the cap curves you'll be able to compare models to each other and understand

88

00:06:47,730  -->  00:06:50,840
how much gain this is also sometimes called the gain chart.

89

00:06:50,970  -->  00:06:57,660
How much gain you get in each of these models compared to the random scenario or how much again you

90

00:06:57,660  -->  00:07:03,450
get additional gain you get from switching from one model to the next or from the green one to the red

91

00:07:03,450  -->  00:07:08,520
one for instance you're improving your hit ratio and therefore you're improving your return on investment

92

00:07:08,520  -->  00:07:08,920
.

93

00:07:08,940  -->  00:07:11,940
So therefore the read model is better.

94

00:07:11,970  -->  00:07:14,610
And this is how we are going to be assessing models.

95

00:07:14,680  -->  00:07:21,240
So let's label them the blue line is a random selection process like a monkey could do that to just

96

00:07:21,240  -->  00:07:28,770
pick out random sample and you send the letter or just send it to everybody you get 100 percent of respondents

97

00:07:28,770  -->  00:07:29,490
.

98

00:07:29,490  -->  00:07:31,590
The green line is a poor model.

99

00:07:31,650  -->  00:07:38,520
So it's always is better than random but it's still not as good as the red one the red one is a good

100

00:07:38,520  -->  00:07:45,240
model as you can see here or around the 50 percent mark we're getting just over 80 percent response's

101

00:07:45,240  -->  00:07:47,280
that's considered a good model.

102

00:07:47,280  -->  00:07:55,590
And there's one more line that you can think of here and it's this line this line is the ideal line

103

00:07:56,220  -->  00:08:05,460
and this is what would happen if you had a crystal ball if you could predict exactly who is going to

104

00:08:05,460  -->  00:08:07,650
purchase and contact those people.

105

00:08:07,650  -->  00:08:09,180
This is what it would look like.

106

00:08:09,180  -->  00:08:09,540
Why.

107

00:08:09,540  -->  00:08:18,150
Well because if you look at that the place where that spline occurs you will see that it's exactly 10

108

00:08:18,150  -->  00:08:20,410
percent and 10 percent as you remember.

109

00:08:20,490  -->  00:08:24,240
We know that only 10 percent of our customers ever purchase.

110

00:08:24,240  -->  00:08:31,800
So basically you're saying that on the horizontal axis I'm going to take 10 percent and each and every

111

00:08:31,800  -->  00:08:36,330
single one of those customers I pick and that 10 percent they are going to be those that purchase.

112

00:08:36,360  -->  00:08:42,990
That means I will go right straight to 100 percent with this last scenario.

113

00:08:43,000  -->  00:08:45,750
This actually took me a while to get my head around.

114

00:08:45,930  -->  00:08:50,550
When I first heard about it because I never understood why this line at the top.

115

00:08:50,550  -->  00:08:52,150
Why does it break like that.

116

00:08:52,260  -->  00:08:55,010
But that's exactly the reason because you you.

117

00:08:55,200  -->  00:08:55,700
You mad.

118

00:08:55,740  -->  00:09:00,510
You can imagine that you have a crystal ball and you contact in the first 10 percent or however many

119

00:09:00,510  -->  00:09:07,250
in your specific business scenario customers ever purchase you contact them right away.

120

00:09:07,290  -->  00:09:11,760
And then it's just flat from there because it doesn't matter how many more you contact they're not going

121

00:09:11,760  -->  00:09:12,210
to purchase.

122

00:09:12,210  -->  00:09:14,700
That's just the reality of things.

123

00:09:14,970  -->  00:09:18,280
And that is the curves that you have on a cap curve.

124

00:09:18,300  -->  00:09:21,240
If you ever see a model that goes under the blue line.

125

00:09:21,530  -->  00:09:22,670
I didn't even draw one here.

126

00:09:22,680  -->  00:09:31,650
But if that happens that's a very bad model is basically doing you a disservice if it's if you see the

127

00:09:31,650  -->  00:09:36,060
curve in the blue line and we'll talk about model deterioration further in the course when we're talking

128

00:09:36,060  -->  00:09:38,270
about maintaining a models.

129

00:09:38,370  -->  00:09:43,680
So that's it for the cap curve for the introduction to cap curve will be using the cap curve very actively

130

00:09:43,680  -->  00:09:45,890
in this section to assess our model.

131

00:09:45,990  -->  00:09:51,630
And in fact we actually build two of them and one for a model and one for our test data so that will

132

00:09:51,630  -->  00:09:53,580
be very interesting to compare.

133

00:09:53,580  -->  00:10:00,330
One last thing I wanted to mention is and note that we have the cap which is a cumulative accuracy profile

134

00:10:00,630  -->  00:10:04,380
and we have a rock which is a receiver operating characteristic.

135

00:10:04,380  -->  00:10:12,600
A lot of people get these things confused and my myself included I used to get it confused I even tried

136

00:10:12,600  -->  00:10:20,100
proving one time a colleague of mine who knew this stuff really well at the time when I was just learning

137

00:10:20,100  -->  00:10:26,420
it that she was wrong but that was a funny experience but they're not the same thing.

138

00:10:26,430  -->  00:10:30,980
So cumulative accuracy profiles all we talked about receive operating characteristics.

139

00:10:31,050  -->  00:10:33,670
We won't be covering this course.

140

00:10:33,670  -->  00:10:37,020
It'll be in my advanced course on statistics.

141

00:10:37,110  -->  00:10:42,330
It's very similar it looks similar and that's why a lot of people get confused and actually I think

142

00:10:42,720  -->  00:10:47,610
the other reason is that the rock curve is in Wikipedia there's an article for their occurred but there

143

00:10:47,610  -->  00:10:51,570
isn't one in English for the cumulative accuracy profile.

144

00:10:51,780  -->  00:11:00,180
So it's quite hard to find information on the cap curve just by searching in Google so maybe you'll

145

00:11:00,180  -->  00:11:04,550
be the first person to write a Wikipedia article on the cap curve.

146

00:11:04,560  -->  00:11:07,130
Who knows maybe.

147

00:11:07,290  -->  00:11:13,200
Anyway I look forward to seeing your next tutorial and where we will be working with the kept curve

148

00:11:13,210  -->  00:11:13,610
.

149

00:11:13,980  -->  00:11:15,720
And until then happy analyzing
