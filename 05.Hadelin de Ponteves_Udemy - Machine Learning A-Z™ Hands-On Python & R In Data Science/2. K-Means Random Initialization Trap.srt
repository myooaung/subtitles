00:00:00,600  -->  00:00:03,150
Hello welcome back to the course of machine learning.

2

00:00:03,150  -->  00:00:10,500
Today we're going to talk about specific aspects of the Kamins algorithm which is the random insulation

3

00:00:10,590  -->  00:00:11,350
trap.

4

00:00:11,550  -->  00:00:15,550
So let's have a look at this phenomenon and see what it's all about.

5

00:00:15,870  -->  00:00:17,650
So random insulation traps.

6

00:00:17,700  -->  00:00:20,430
Here we've got a scatterplot.

7

00:00:20,430  -->  00:00:24,380
Again we have two Berbel So we've got the x and y coordinates.

8

00:00:24,540  -->  00:00:28,320
And in this case let's say we're going to choose three clusters.

9

00:00:28,320  -->  00:00:33,450
So right away you kind of can't tell which is the final result what is the Father's are going to look

10

00:00:33,450  -->  00:00:35,160
like if we choose three clusters.

11

00:00:35,250  -->  00:00:39,280
It does look like you can pretty easily spot them here.

12

00:00:39,300  -->  00:00:42,510
But let's them with less form this operation this algorithm.

13

00:00:42,630  -->  00:00:49,350
And if we initialize our centroid like this then what we will get is because we already kind of can

14

00:00:49,350  -->  00:00:52,730
tell that probably that's a classic asset class and that's closer.

15

00:00:52,730  -->  00:00:57,630
So just to make the algorithm a bit faster so we don't have to do too many easy steps and directions

16

00:00:57,630  -->  00:01:00,630
we're going to select all the centroid like this.

17

00:01:00,860  -->  00:01:05,170
And the right of way if we perform the algorithm We'll get to these clusters.

18

00:01:05,400  -->  00:01:12,560
And next is even if we move around the centroid So we find the centroid of each of these classers nothing's

19

00:01:12,570  -->  00:01:13,190
going to change.

20

00:01:13,190  -->  00:01:18,930
So you can in your own time you can perform the steps that we learned about in the mirror tutorial and

21

00:01:18,930  -->  00:01:23,340
see that nothing will indeed change because of the way we selected the centroid.

22

00:01:23,340  -->  00:01:25,310
This is already the final result.

23

00:01:25,320  -->  00:01:28,700
So those are the going to be the clusters that we're going to end up with.

24

00:01:28,710  -->  00:01:35,770
So that's kind of the end result of the Kamins our own because we selected the clusters of the centroid

25

00:01:35,770  -->  00:01:37,550
is in the places where we did.

26

00:01:37,560  -->  00:01:43,440
Now the question is What if we select a centroid in different locations will we be able to change the

27

00:01:43,440  -->  00:01:45,900
result will all be different.

28

00:01:45,900  -->  00:01:51,420
And of course an algorithm has to be what we want from this algorithm is for it to use a deterministic

29

00:01:51,420  -->  00:01:56,520
result because we can select the centroid at random and therefore we don't want that selection of centroid

30

00:01:56,550  -->  00:02:00,380
to affect how the clustering is going to happen.

31

00:02:00,390  -->  00:02:02,100
But let's have a look and see what happens.

32

00:02:02,340  -->  00:02:09,390
So what will happen if we had a bad random initializations so bad is like a term we're going to use

33

00:02:09,390  -->  00:02:13,920
loosely for now but you will see why we're using bad random insulation just now.

34

00:02:14,220  -->  00:02:17,610
So again we're going to go through the steps that we discussed in the Bruce tutorial.

35

00:02:17,610  -->  00:02:21,750
We're going to choose a number of clusters which is three all selected random three boys which will

36

00:02:21,750  -->  00:02:27,510
be us and Troys will assign Is there a point to the closest Android that will form K clusters will compute

37

00:02:27,750  -->  00:02:32,880
and place a new centroid for each class of thinking in terms of center of mass or center of gravity

38

00:02:33,180  -->  00:02:36,850
and the survival re-assign Is there a point to the new closer centroid.

39

00:02:37,050  -->  00:02:40,260
If there are any assessment of place we'll return to step four.

40

00:02:40,320  -->  00:02:43,280
Others will go to the end because the model has converged.

41

00:02:43,290  -->  00:02:47,700
So these steps we discussed previously Let's have a look at them in action.

42

00:02:47,700  -->  00:02:48,080
All right.

43

00:02:48,110  -->  00:02:53,870
So three clusters and this time is sort of selecting a centroid here here and here.

44

00:02:53,910  -->  00:02:58,590
What we're going to do is we're going to think differently we're going to select the centroid is like

45

00:02:58,590  -->  00:02:58,980
this.

46

00:02:58,980  -->  00:03:02,730
So we'll put one centroid here on this side once it's right here.

47

00:03:02,730  -->  00:03:04,260
And what's interesting here.

48

00:03:04,320  -->  00:03:05,880
So let's have a look what happens now.

49

00:03:06,180  -->  00:03:09,850
If we draw a line so this and we have 3 cluster two centroid.

50

00:03:09,870  -->  00:03:12,340
But the principle is the kind of the same.

51

00:03:12,390  -->  00:03:17,190
We still have a point which is equidistant from all three of them so this point here is the same distance

52

00:03:17,190  -->  00:03:18,230
from all three.

53

00:03:18,300  -->  00:03:21,570
And then this line is equidistant from these two.

54

00:03:21,570  -->  00:03:24,900
This line is equidistant from these two the size equidistant from these two.

55

00:03:24,900  -->  00:03:29,970
Again this is not part of the algorithm as part of the algorithm you just take each individual point

56

00:03:29,970  -->  00:03:35,400
you look at this point and you see which centroid is closest to the Semmes green coloured green.

57

00:03:35,400  -->  00:03:39,790
This one you check again with colored green this one you check again colored green and so on.

58

00:03:39,940  -->  00:03:45,270
Then this one is the closest to red you'd color are red and so on but just to make things easier for

59

00:03:45,270  -->  00:03:46,760
ourselves we're going to use this little hack.

60

00:03:46,930  -->  00:03:53,400
We're going to use these lines to say anything in this part of the chart is going to be closest to read

61

00:03:53,400  -->  00:03:53,430
.

62

00:03:53,460  -->  00:03:58,250
Just because these are equidistant lines and you think in this part of the charge is going to be green

63

00:03:58,260  -->  00:04:00,010
anything is partial is going to be blue.

64

00:04:00,030  -->  00:04:01,210
It'll just save us time.

65

00:04:01,380  -->  00:04:07,230
So based on this method we can tell right away that this is the red cluster for now this the blue is

66

00:04:07,230  -->  00:04:07,840
the green.

67

00:04:08,160  -->  00:04:11,190
So now we're going to assign each data point to the closest centroid.

68

00:04:11,190  -->  00:04:12,000
That's great.

69

00:04:12,000  -->  00:04:17,500
Now we're going to we want to step four and we're going to remove these clusters.

70

00:04:17,520  -->  00:04:22,650
So we're going to recalculate compute and place and new centroid for each cluster so there we can see

71

00:04:22,650  -->  00:04:26,110
that that is probably the center of mass for the red points.

72

00:04:26,110  -->  00:04:29,010
That's one for Bluepoint That's one for green points.

73

00:04:29,070  -->  00:04:32,450
So we move our centroid to the new locations.

74

00:04:32,730  -->  00:04:37,970
And now we get to perform Step Five We're going to reassign edged out a point to the new close centroid

75

00:04:37,970  -->  00:04:38,300
.

76

00:04:38,310  -->  00:04:42,600
So again we're going to use that quick hack with the lines that see how the lines will look like this

77

00:04:42,600  -->  00:04:43,370
time.

78

00:04:43,680  -->  00:04:48,300
There's our new equidistant point and these are the equidistant lines.

79

00:04:48,330  -->  00:04:55,220
So this time you can see that nothing will change the red points are already in the red corner of blue

80

00:04:55,220  -->  00:04:59,630
points or in the blue corner and green points are in the green corner so nothing's going to change.

81

00:04:59,640  -->  00:05:01,100
There will be no re-assignment.

82

00:05:01,110  -->  00:05:06,970
So we don't go to step forward instead go to finalizing the algorithm because it has converged.

83

00:05:07,080  -->  00:05:08,010
So there we go.

84

00:05:08,040  -->  00:05:09,090
That is our model.

85

00:05:09,090  -->  00:05:09,850
It is ready.

86

00:05:10,050  -->  00:05:16,530
And as a result we have these three clusters Now these clusters are different to what we saw at the

87

00:05:16,530  -->  00:05:18,050
start so let's have a look.

88

00:05:18,120  -->  00:05:19,890
This is what we saw at the start.

89

00:05:19,890  -->  00:05:24,330
We're going to call them the truth 3 clusters because you can tell just from the charge you can tell

90

00:05:24,330  -->  00:05:29,010
that these points would most likely to form a cluster.

91

00:05:29,010  -->  00:05:33,690
These would form a class and these would form close just by looking at it you can intuitively tell that

92

00:05:33,930  -->  00:05:34,840
that is the case.

93

00:05:34,890  -->  00:05:36,210
This is what we got in the first.

94

00:05:36,210  -->  00:05:39,380
At the start of this tutorial and this is what we got now.

95

00:05:39,450  -->  00:05:46,080
So you can see that the three clusters are different and therefore what we have is a situation or phenomenon

96

00:05:46,380  -->  00:05:52,140
where the selection of the Central is at the very start of the algorithm can potentially dictate the

97

00:05:52,200  -->  00:05:53,510
outcome of the algorithm.

98

00:05:53,580  -->  00:05:58,040
And that's not a good thing because the centroid are selected at random.

99

00:05:58,050  -->  00:06:00,090
So how do you combat this.

100

00:06:00,090  -->  00:06:01,550
How do you battle this.

101

00:06:01,650  -->  00:06:06,370
Well the answer is actually not as straightforward.

102

00:06:06,390  -->  00:06:14,070
There is a addition or a modification to the Kamins algorithm that allows you to correctly select the

103

00:06:14,070  -->  00:06:19,620
centroid and the solution here is the Kamins plus plus algorithm.

104

00:06:19,620  -->  00:06:25,920
Now at the same time I wanted to mention that we're not actually going to delve deeply into the K means

105

00:06:26,280  -->  00:06:29,370
plus plus algorithm in how it's structured.

106

00:06:29,430  -->  00:06:33,930
You can definitely read up more about it on Wikipedia or other sources.

107

00:06:33,960  -->  00:06:39,300
It is quite a involves approach in how that selection occurs.

108

00:06:39,450  -->  00:06:46,050
But the good news is that all of this happens in the background so the Kamins plus plus happens either

109

00:06:46,050  -->  00:06:48,380
in our or Python or whatever tool you're using.

110

00:06:48,450  -->  00:06:50,990
You don't need to actually implement it.

111

00:06:51,090  -->  00:06:59,400
So it's just a good idea to be aware of this issue that there is a true cluster result that you're after

112

00:06:59,400  -->  00:06:59,530
.

113

00:06:59,610  -->  00:07:06,660
And there can be some false or some non desirable clustering results clustering outcomes of the Kamin

114

00:07:06,660  -->  00:07:08,370
clustering algorithm.

115

00:07:08,580  -->  00:07:14,910
It's good to be aware of that issue and it's also good to know that the tools that you use will be or

116

00:07:14,970  -->  00:07:21,180
make sure that the tools you're using are going to be implementing that specific selection of the random

117

00:07:21,180  -->  00:07:21,720
centroid.

118

00:07:21,720  -->  00:07:24,510
At the very start so that you get a good result.

119

00:07:24,540  -->  00:07:28,860
So definitely if you are more interested in interesting to learn more about the Kamins plus plus Algren

120

00:07:29,250  -->  00:07:32,850
definitely read up about it but otherwise it's not something that you really have to worry about it

121

00:07:32,850  -->  00:07:38,610
just something that you need to keep in mind and make sure or be confident that the tools you're using

122

00:07:38,910  -->  00:07:42,500
are bypassing this insulation trap.

123

00:07:42,590  -->  00:07:46,330
So enjoy today sartorial and I look forward to seeing you next time.

124

00:07:46,350  -->  00:07:48,190
Until then in Germany in learning
