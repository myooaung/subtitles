00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.380
Hello my friends.

2
00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:02.520
All right let's do this.

3
00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.800
Let us build and train the decision tree regression model on the whole dataset.

4
00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.650
So I actually could ask you to do it yourself.

5
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.370
You know even without giving you the hint of what class you would use.

6
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.910
Because I also would like you to practice to research the documentation.

7
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.670
So if I were to ask you to try to do this before me or to build and train this decision tree regression

8
00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.260
model on this data set.

9
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.140
Well what you would had to do would go to Google or Bing and then type in the search bar decision tree

10
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.210
regression class of psychic learn.

11
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.960
Then you would find the name of the class.

12
00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.840
It would probably be on the first link and then based on all the work we did before you know on how

13
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.630
to build and train a machinery more with psychic learn you would totally be able to do this whole step

14
00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:46.290
on your own.

15
00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:46.580
All right.

16
00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.210
So if you want to do this please press pause in this video and do the exercise and I'm sure you'll be

17
00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.010
proud to find a solution.

18
00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:53.530
All right.

19
00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.220
And now let's build a solution together.

20
00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.950
Starting with the creation of a new code cell.

21
00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:00.160
And here we go.

22
00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.080
The name of the class that can build a decision tree regression model inside could learn.

23
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.060
It's called Decision Tree regressive.

24
00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.530
It is a class that belongs to the tree module of learn.

25
00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:20.880
And therefore here we're going to start from cycle LEARN FROM WHICH WE'RE GONNA CALL THAT TREE module

26
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:27.460
and from which we're going to import that decision Google collab will guess it.

27
00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:28.240
There we go.

28
00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:34.240
So be careful it's not Decision Tree classifier that will be for part 3 classification but Decision

29
00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.740
Tree regressive.

30
00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:36.350
All right.

31
00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:41.710
This is based on the same moral decision trees but Decision Tree regressive will predict a continuous

32
00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.090
numerical value and decision tree classification will predict a category.

33
00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:53.260
All right then the next natural step here is of course to create an object or an instance of that decision

34
00:01:53.260 --> 00:02:00.340
tree regressive class and we're going to call that as usual re aggressor which will be equal of course

35
00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:08.080
to the call of this class I'm copying this and pasting that right here and adding some parentheses.

36
00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.740
All right so now the question is do we have to input anything here in the branch offices.

37
00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:12.760
Well actually no.

38
00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.230
You know there are not many parameters to tune in the decision tree regression model.

39
00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:23.030
I don't recommend you spend too much time tuning it and just to try it among your other regression models.

40
00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.480
But if you really want to tune it please note that there is this part 10 of the course which covers

41
00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:34.720
all the techniques of parameter tuning which allows you to improve and optimize the performance of a

42
00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:35.740
single model.

43
00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.660
And so don't worry you'll know how to deploy these techniques to enhance a model.

44
00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.620
But here we just want to learn how to build and train the decision tree regression model and therefore

45
00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.270
we will only input one parameter but which is just for training purposes.

46
00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:54.910
It is you know that random state parameter which will allow us to get the same result in the end because

47
00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:00.850
indeed there are some random factors happening when you build and train your decision tree aggressor

48
00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.350
and therefore if we don't fix the seed we will get slightly different results.

49
00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.320
Adrienne and you know it's nicer to have the same results so that we can all be on the same page.

50
00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:18.610
So we're just going to input random underscore state parameter and set that equal to zero.

51
00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.890
Right we're fixing the seed here with that zero value for the random state parameter.

52
00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.440
And now final step.

53
00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.860
Well you totally know how to finish this.

54
00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:35.920
We just need to take our aggressor and then call the fit method which takes as input of course the matrix

55
00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:41.020
of features X the whole matrix and then the dependent variable vector Y.

56
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:48.370
All right so this will actually train your decision to re regress or to understand the correlations

57
00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:55.420
between the position levels here and the salaries after which you will have a trained model which you

58
00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:01.960
will be able to deploy in production to predict a new result and especially that salary of the position

59
00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.910
level six point five.

60
00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:04.370
All right.

61
00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:05.870
So that's what we'll do in the next material.

62
00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:13.190
But first let's not forget to run the cell to indeed build and train that decision tree regression model.

63
00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:19.390
And also I want to say congratulations if you pressed buzz at the beginning of this tutorial to code

64
00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:20.800
this by yourself first.

65
00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:24.450
And also congratulations to those who tried because that's really what matters.

66
00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.880
You know to take action to at least try and practice.

67
00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.740
Okay so I'll go here.

68
00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:30.190
That's great.

69
00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:37.130
We have our regression model and now in that same spirit of you know taking action to practice and try

70
00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:39.300
to implement things on your own.

71
00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:45.640
Well I would like you to try to predict that salary of the position of number six point five and there

72
00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:51.560
is absolutely no trap here or no difficulties so I have no doubt you will actually smash this.

73
00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:58.370
All right so please try to do this and will implement the easy solution together in the next tutorial.

74
00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:59.940
Until then enjoy machine learning.
