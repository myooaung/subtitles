Hello and welcome to this art tutorial.

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:08,250
So in the previous tutorial we got the exciting result of the total reward being two thousand one hundred

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:14,040
and seventy eight and therefore almost doubling the Total War we get with the random selection algorithm

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,220
which was around 1200.

5
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:21,780
So that was the first exciting result and we also got another exciting result which was you know the

6
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:30,240
best ad to show to the user given by this selected vector by looking at the last round here containing

7
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:36,700
only fives that showed us that the ad was the highest conversion rate is the version number five of

8
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:37,580
the ad.

9
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:39,190
So two exciting results.

10
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:44,190
And now to finish this section even better we will have a look at the histogram to have a quick look

11
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:50,460
at the overall strategy you know to see the number of times each ad was selected and how the selections

12
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,840
of at number five dominate the selections of the other ads.

13
00:00:54,030 --> 00:01:01,330
So that's going to be very quick and easy because we simply need to use hest which is right here center.

14
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:07,680
And now as input we simply need to get the variable that contains the values you want to plot on this

15
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,550
histogram.

16
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:16,590
And that's of course the ads selected vector because you know this vector tells us which ad was selected

17
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:17,620
at each round.

18
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:23,610
And so this histogram method here will look at the number of times each add was selected in this selected

19
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:26,510
vector and that will plot the histogram.

20
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:31,600
So basically we're done and now just to make it better we can add a color.

21
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:35,250
So we type call equals blue in quotes.

22
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:42,570
If of course we want the blue color and then add a title by adding this main equals and then in quotes

23
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:43,690
we add a title.

24
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:47,300
And so let's say histogram.

25
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,880
Well adds selections.

26
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,680
Here we go and we can also add a label to the x axis.

27
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,690
So saying we use quotes we are here.

28
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:05,750
Right because you know basically what we all have on the x axis are going to be the labels of the ads.

29
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,770
So that's why I'm adding here ads.

30
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:22,640
And of course let's add a y label quotes and let's say a number of times each ad was selected great.

31
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:24,650
And basically we're done.

32
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:26,020
So now let's have a look.

33
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:31,270
Will select this code section here and press command control plus enter to execute.

34
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:33,080
And here is the histogram.

35
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:39,890
And wow we can clearly see that's the at number five is the ad that was most selected by the users.

36
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:45,440
That is the other has a higher conversion rate and therefore no doubt that's the ad we need to show

37
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:50,420
to our users for the marketing campaigns of this chip brand new luxury SUV.

38
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:54,320
So no doubt the fifth ad wonderful.

39
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,890
We completed our job as a machine learning scientist.

40
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:58,710
And so congratulations.

41
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:01,070
We implemented a great algorithm.

42
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:06,100
So now what we'll do is implement another algorithm to see if we can do better.

43
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:10,030
And this other algorithm will be Thompson something algorithm.

44
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:16,350
So let's see if Tompson something can beat UCB and we'll find out in the next section.

45
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:18,020
Until then in German learning
