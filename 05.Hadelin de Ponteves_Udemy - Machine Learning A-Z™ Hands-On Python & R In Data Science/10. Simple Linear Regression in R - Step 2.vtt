00:00:00.240  -->  00:00:02.780
Hello and welcome to this art tutorial.

2

00:00:02.980  -->  00:00:04.070
So preview Statoil.

3

00:00:04.080  -->  00:00:09.780
We prepared our data correctly so that now we are ready to fit our simple in your regression to our

4

00:00:09.780  -->  00:00:12.220
data set without any issues.

5

00:00:12.510  -->  00:00:14.570
So we are going to do that right now.

6

00:00:14.610  -->  00:00:20.870
And as usual we are going to use the simplest way which is to take the L and function.

7

00:00:20.910  -->  00:00:22.410
So we're going to do that right now.

8

00:00:22.410  -->  00:00:30.120
We're going to call new variable regressors and that's going to be the simple in the regress or itself

9

00:00:30.840  -->  00:00:34.830
then equals and then that's where we use the LN function.

10

00:00:34.830  -->  00:00:41.880
So let's just type LME here and then let's press 1 to see the info of this function and especially the

11

00:00:41.880  -->  00:00:42.870
arguments.

12

00:00:42.870  -->  00:00:43.590
So let's see.

13

00:00:43.590  -->  00:00:46.100
The first argument we have to input is formula.

14

00:00:46.260  -->  00:00:49.070
So let's put it formula.

15

00:00:49.410  -->  00:00:51.640
And according to you what is it going to be.

16

00:00:51.870  -->  00:00:58.890
Well this is going to be the dependent variable expressed as a linear combination of the independent

17

00:00:58.890  -->  00:00:59.620
variable.

18

00:00:59.910  -->  00:01:05.130
So here it's very simple since we only have one dependent variable and one independent variable.

19

00:01:05.130  -->  00:01:11.450
We just need to type for me that equals salary than our plus.

20

00:01:11.460  -->  00:01:13.230
And here you go.

21

00:01:13.230  -->  00:01:18.920
And then we put the independent variable which is yours experience.

22

00:01:18.990  -->  00:01:25.500
So what does this notation means that means that the salary is proportional to years experience.

23

00:01:25.680  -->  00:01:27.330
Okay so that's it for the first argument.

24

00:01:27.330  -->  00:01:29.090
That's the formula we need to input.

25

00:01:29.370  -->  00:01:32.140
And that's actually the simple in the our regression formula.

26

00:01:32.400  -->  00:01:37.420
And then we need to add a second argument which is let's see the data.

27

00:01:37.610  -->  00:01:44.590
Okay and that's normal that's because we have to specify to our on which data we want to train are simple

28

00:01:44.600  -->  00:01:51.120
in our regression model and of course this data is the training set because the training set is the

29

00:01:51.120  -->  00:01:53.590
set on which you build your model.

30

00:01:54.000  -->  00:01:59.280
Okay so that's it actually I know there are some other arguments but these are optional arguments that

31

00:01:59.310  -->  00:02:00.840
we don't really need here.

32

00:02:00.870  -->  00:02:03.810
So we won't just use this to formulate and data.

33

00:02:04.230  -->  00:02:08.550
Okay so that's it the aggressor will be ready once we select it and execute it.

34

00:02:08.550  -->  00:02:15.050
So let's do this right now and let's press command control plus enter to execute.

35

00:02:15.270  -->  00:02:20.700
Here we go now the regressors ready as you can see and just appeared here if you want to have some info

36

00:02:20.700  -->  00:02:27.660
about this regressors then the best way to do it is to you know go here in the console and type summary

37

00:02:27.680  -->  00:02:28.400
.

38

00:02:28.580  -->  00:02:35.070
Regrets are because the name of our aggressor is regress or then type enter and then you have some very

39

00:02:35.070  -->  00:02:40.250
good informations about your simple in your model for example.

40

00:02:40.350  -->  00:02:40.650
Okay.

41

00:02:40.640  -->  00:02:45.380
So let's see let's just put that up right.

42

00:02:45.690  -->  00:02:48.590
So first it tells you what the formula is.

43

00:02:48.660  -->  00:02:54.240
Okay so it's the salary being proportional to the number of years of experience and that the model is

44

00:02:54.240  -->  00:02:55.550
built on the train set.

45

00:02:55.650  -->  00:02:59.110
Then you have some info about the residuals we won't be talking about this now.

46

00:02:59.400  -->  00:03:06.750
But the really important section is this one coefficient because not only itself the value of your coefficients

47

00:03:06.750  -->  00:03:12.930
in the simple linear regression equation but also it tells you the statistical significance of your

48

00:03:12.930  -->  00:03:14.370
core efficiency.

49

00:03:15.000  -->  00:03:17.030
And here we observe three stars here.

50

00:03:17.040  -->  00:03:23.430
That means the years experience independent variable is highly statistically significant because you

51

00:03:23.430  -->  00:03:27.940
can either have no star or one star two stars three stars.

52

00:03:28.080  -->  00:03:33.780
No star it means that there is no statistical significance and three stars means that there is a high

53

00:03:33.780  -->  00:03:35.400
statistical significance.

54

00:03:35.400  -->  00:03:41.670
So that's the first info that's a first hand to what is going to happen because we already know by looking

55

00:03:41.670  -->  00:03:47.310
at this that there will be a strong linear relationship between the salary and the number of years of

56

00:03:47.310  -->  00:03:54.870
experience and the other info here is the P-value and the P-value is another indicator of the statistical

57

00:03:54.870  -->  00:04:01.830
significance because the lower the p value is the more significant your independent variable is going

58

00:04:01.830  -->  00:04:02.640
to be.

59

00:04:02.640  -->  00:04:08.730
That is the more impact the more effect your independent variable is going to have on the dependent

60

00:04:08.730  -->  00:04:09.390
variable.

61

00:04:09.780  -->  00:04:16.530
And usually a good threshold for the P-value is five percent which means that when you are below 5 percent

62

00:04:16.650  -->  00:04:19.100
the independent variable is highly significant.

63

00:04:19.140  -->  00:04:23.020
And when we are over 5 percent that means that it's less significant.

64

00:04:23.220  -->  00:04:28.800
And here you can see the P-value is one point fifty to ten at the power of minus 14 which means that

65

00:04:28.800  -->  00:04:31.470
it's a very very very small P-value.

66

00:04:31.620  -->  00:04:38.060
So that means that this independent valuable years of experience is highly statistically significant

67

00:04:38.340  -->  00:04:42.450
and it has high impact and high effects on the formula dependent variable.

68

00:04:42.840  -->  00:04:45.410
So that's very important information.

69

00:04:45.720  -->  00:04:52.230
Get the reflex to look at these by you know Taiping summer aggressor because this is really important

70

00:04:52.290  -->  00:04:58.660
especially when you want to try out several potential independent variables you need to look at their

71

00:04:58.680  -->  00:05:01.400
statistical significance to choose them.

72

00:05:02.070  -->  00:05:07.410
And then you have some informations of your model globally which we'll we'll be talking about at the

73

00:05:07.410  -->  00:05:13.620
end of this part part one regression when we'll be talking about ways to evaluate your model when here

74

00:05:13.620  -->  00:05:18.600
is you can see you have to multiple the R-squared that are Kyrle We'll talk to you about and the adjusted

75

00:05:18.600  -->  00:05:24.660
R-squared if you have several models with several teams of independent variables then that's the adjusted

76

00:05:24.660  -->  00:05:27.680
R-squared you must choose to choose the best model.

77

00:05:27.810  -->  00:05:32.610
All right so there was just a parenthesis to give you this very important trick to know in our are and

78

00:05:32.610  -->  00:05:35.170
learn how to evaluate your model already.

79

00:05:35.190  -->  00:05:41.700
So actually we are done fitting the simple in their aggression to our dataset our training set and in

80

00:05:41.700  -->  00:05:49.770
the next tutorial we're going to be predicting the test that results to finally see how our simple regression

81

00:05:49.770  -->  00:05:52.870
behaves on a new set on some new observations.

82

00:05:53.100  -->  00:05:54.840
OK so that's the end of the story.

83

00:05:54.900  -->  00:05:57.020
I look forward to seeing you in the next one.

84

00:05:57.030  -->  00:05:58.980
And until then enjoy machine learning.
