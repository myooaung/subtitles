00:00:00,240  -->  00:00:02,470
Hello and welcome to this art it's toil.

2

00:00:02,700  -->  00:00:07,680
So this story was not going to be like the usual ones because basically what we're going to do is just

3

00:00:07,740  -->  00:00:13,650
make a template in order to build our future classification models more efficiently because indeed we

4

00:00:13,650  -->  00:00:18,900
already built our first classification model which is the logistic regression model and then the future

5

00:00:18,900  -->  00:00:24,640
sections we're going to build a new classification morals like that as VM support vector machine kernel

6

00:00:24,740  -->  00:00:30,430
SVM Navy base decision tree classification as well as Ranum first classification.

7

00:00:30,660  -->  00:00:35,900
And so you know we will build these models in the same data set the social network as data set.

8

00:00:36,000  -->  00:00:40,560
And so we will make one templates for all our future classification models.

9

00:00:40,710  -->  00:00:43,720
So right now let's make our classification template.

10

00:00:43,920  -->  00:00:48,690
And maybe you already noticed that we we're going to make this template very easily because the only

11

00:00:48,690  -->  00:00:55,470
part of the code where we cut something specific to logistic regression is only in this part because

12

00:00:55,920  -->  00:00:59,960
we use the GNN function to create our logistic regression classifier.

13

00:01:00,150  -->  00:01:03,840
But then in the other sections everything is purely generalized.

14

00:01:03,870  -->  00:01:09,480
You know we use our classify variable here which is indeed an Disko the logistic regression transpired

15

00:01:09,510  -->  00:01:11,050
within the next sections.

16

00:01:11,060  -->  00:01:15,990
This classifiers is going to be something else and same in this section here we don't code anything

17

00:01:15,990  -->  00:01:18,620
specifically related to logistic regression.

18

00:01:18,630  -->  00:01:22,230
Same in this section here about the visualization of the training that results.

19

00:01:22,230  -->  00:01:25,110
The only variable that we use is classifier.

20

00:01:25,440  -->  00:01:30,600
So nothing directly related to logistic regression and same for this section here.

21

00:01:30,600  -->  00:01:33,100
The only variable that we use is classifier.

22

00:01:33,180  -->  00:01:39,510
And so if we give another definition to classify here then this code here will be perfectly adaptable

23

00:01:39,690  -->  00:01:43,070
to this new class I will be making in the future sections.

24

00:01:43,140  -->  00:01:48,510
So that's why it's so simple and therefore it's worth doing that for the next models will be creating

25

00:01:48,510  -->  00:01:49,080
.

26

00:01:49,110  -->  00:01:53,160
So I'm going to take everything from here to the bottom.

27

00:01:53,160  -->  00:02:00,270
Copy and paste it here in my future classification templates and now our classification template is

28

00:02:00,270  -->  00:02:01,380
almost ready.

29

00:02:01,380  -->  00:02:07,800
We just need to remove this section here because this is directly related to logistic regression because

30

00:02:07,800  -->  00:02:12,830
here we are using the GNN function that is only used to build a logistic regression model.

31

00:02:12,990  -->  00:02:16,890
But you know in the next sections for the next classifiers we'll be making.

32

00:02:17,070  -->  00:02:22,920
Well we'll have this classified variable here that will be the classifier of our future classification

33

00:02:22,920  -->  00:02:23,590
models.

34

00:02:23,670  -->  00:02:29,160
And then here you know we'll use the right function needed to build this classification model and then

35

00:02:29,250  -->  00:02:30,990
all the rest will be ready.

36

00:02:31,080  -->  00:02:36,630
We will have our new classifier defined here then since we have Caspari here and predict function well

37

00:02:36,630  -->  00:02:41,850
we won't have anything to change here and simpler here and simpler here as well because the only variable

38

00:02:41,850  -->  00:02:43,820
that we use is classifier.

39

00:02:43,890  -->  00:02:48,290
And that will be defined as the classifier of a new classification model.

40

00:02:48,540  -->  00:02:53,370
So let's remember that and let's you know to remind us of what we need to do.

41

00:02:53,580  -->  00:03:01,650
I'll just add a come here to say that it's the section where we create our classifier here.

42

00:03:01,650  -->  00:03:02,220
All right.

43

00:03:02,250  -->  00:03:04,960
So that's the section where you create your classifier.

44

00:03:04,980  -->  00:03:10,110
And by the way you can totally use the same place on your data sets and your business problems you will

45

00:03:10,110  -->  00:03:14,820
just need to change the name of the data set and pick your columns of interest and then just change

46

00:03:14,820  -->  00:03:18,080
the name of the depan variable here and here as well.

47

00:03:18,690  -->  00:03:23,730
But then what you will only need to do is to create your classifier here so you will pick the classify

48

00:03:23,760  -->  00:03:26,700
you want and then everything will be ready.

49

00:03:26,850  -->  00:03:31,890
You will be able to predict that as a result you will be careful of the index here and make the condition

50

00:03:31,890  -->  00:03:38,370
matrix and visualize your training set and test results so you can totally use this template as well

51

00:03:38,370  -->  00:03:39,500
for your data sets.

52

00:03:39,570  -->  00:03:45,270
And definitely this template is ready to build the future classification morals we will build in this

53

00:03:45,270  -->  00:03:45,820
part.

54

00:03:45,960  -->  00:03:47,300
So here we go.

55

00:03:47,350  -->  00:03:48,290
Template ready.

56

00:03:48,360  -->  00:03:54,100
Well we can still generalize it even more by replacing logistic regression here by classifier.

57

00:03:54,480  -->  00:04:02,670
And also we can replace logistic regression here by classifier and here as well.

58

00:04:04,450  -->  00:04:08,210
And now the template is fully ready and fully generalized.

59

00:04:08,400  -->  00:04:12,800
So you will see how it will be so efficient at building the future classification models.

60

00:04:12,810  -->  00:04:14,980
I look forward to creating these models with you.

61

00:04:15,090  -->  00:04:16,860
And until then enjoy machine learning
