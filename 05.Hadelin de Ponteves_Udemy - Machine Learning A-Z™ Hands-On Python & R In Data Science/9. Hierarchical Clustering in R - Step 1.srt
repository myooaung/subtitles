00:00:00,450  -->  00:00:02,900
Hello and welcome to this art tutorials.

2

00:00:03,030  -->  00:00:08,680
So in the previous tutorials we solved our business problem in Python using hierarchical clustering

3

00:00:08,690  -->  00:00:08,820
.

4

00:00:09,000  -->  00:00:10,890
And this time we're going to solve it in our.

5

00:00:11,000  -->  00:00:13,140
And you're going to see that it's exactly the same.

6

00:00:13,140  -->  00:00:18,000
We are going to import a small dataset first then we're going to use the DNA program to find the optimal

7

00:00:18,000  -->  00:00:22,600
number of clusters that we will fit hierarchical clustering to our small data sets.

8

00:00:22,770  -->  00:00:25,720
And then finally we will visualise our results.

9

00:00:25,740  -->  00:00:30,030
So in this tutorial we're going to do the first step which is to import the small data sets.

10

00:00:30,030  -->  00:00:32,260
So let's start doing it right now.

11

00:00:32,580  -->  00:00:36,150
But before that let's not forget to set a working directory.

12

00:00:36,180  -->  00:00:38,110
So here I am on my desktop.

13

00:00:38,280  -->  00:00:39,950
This is my machine learning easy folder.

14

00:00:39,960  -->  00:00:45,270
Let's open it then let's go to Part 3 clustering then hierarchical clustering.

15

00:00:45,420  -->  00:00:51,360
And now we click on this more button here we click on set has working directory and that sets are hierarchical

16

00:00:51,360  -->  00:00:53,580
clustering folder as a working directory.

17

00:00:53,820  -->  00:00:56,810
So let's make sure we have our small data set in the folder.

18

00:00:56,910  -->  00:00:58,230
Here it is perfect.

19

00:00:58,230  -->  00:00:59,480
We are ready to start.

20

00:00:59,790  -->  00:01:06,420
OK so let's introduce a new section with a Cummins importing the mall data set.

21

00:01:06,420  -->  00:01:07,140
Here we go.

22

00:01:07,230  -->  00:01:09,320
And now let's import our dataset.

23

00:01:09,480  -->  00:01:16,890
So we create this new variable dataset equals read Dotsie S V and in parenthesis we put the name of

24

00:01:16,890  -->  00:01:19,660
our dataset Model T as V in quotes.

25

00:01:19,980  -->  00:01:22,920
OK so let's select this line and execute.

26

00:01:22,980  -->  00:01:25,590
And now our data set appears in data.

27

00:01:25,710  -->  00:01:28,680
So let's click on it and here it is.

28

00:01:28,680  -->  00:01:33,120
So for those of you who didn't follow the Python tutorials I just gave a quick reminder of what this

29

00:01:33,120  -->  00:01:34,440
dataset is about.

30

00:01:34,440  -->  00:01:39,630
So basically these are informations of customers in a mall which are customers that not only subscribe

31

00:01:39,630  -->  00:01:45,540
to the membership card but also come often to the mall and the mall gathered some information up to

32

00:01:45,540  -->  00:01:50,910
hundreds of these customers their gender their age their annual income.

33

00:01:50,910  -->  00:01:54,580
And then for each of these customers they computed a spending score.

34

00:01:54,600  -->  00:01:58,060
So this spending's cortex values between 1 and 100.

35

00:01:58,290  -->  00:02:03,850
And the closer to spending scores to one the less the customer spends and the closer to spending scores

36

00:02:03,870  -->  00:02:04,780
to a hundred.

37

00:02:04,800  -->  00:02:06,280
The more the customer spends.

38

00:02:06,510  -->  00:02:12,420
OK so we have these informations and now our mission is to find some groups of customers.

39

00:02:12,420  -->  00:02:17,760
But since we have no idea of what kind of groups we're looking for or even the number of groups of customers

40

00:02:17,760  -->  00:02:18,870
we're looking for.

41

00:02:18,870  -->  00:02:24,460
This specifically makes this business problem a clustering problem because we don't know the answers

42

00:02:24,460  -->  00:02:24,480
.

43

00:02:24,480  -->  00:02:29,700
We don't know the final results and more precisely we don't know the final categories of our customers

44

00:02:29,700  -->  00:02:30,390
.

45

00:02:30,420  -->  00:02:36,900
OK so we imported our data set and now what we have to do is to prepare our data because we want to

46

00:02:36,900  -->  00:02:40,890
do this clustering only based on the annual income and the spinning score.

47

00:02:41,130  -->  00:02:48,270
So let's create a new variable x equals data set and then in square brackets we're going to put the

48

00:02:48,270  -->  00:02:55,410
two indexes or columns of interest which are let's see let's go back to our dataset indexes and are

49

00:02:55,410  -->  00:02:56,630
started 1.

50

00:02:56,640  -->  00:03:03,180
So customer ideas index one gender as index to Ages index three annual income as an x 4 and spending

51

00:03:03,180  -->  00:03:04,280
scores the next five.

52

00:03:04,500  -->  00:03:10,620
OK so here in the square brackets we add four column 5 that takes our Culham annual income and spending

53

00:03:10,620  -->  00:03:11,280
score.

54

00:03:11,400  -->  00:03:14,190
And now let's select this line of code and execute it.

55

00:03:14,520  -->  00:03:18,320
And here it is our x variable appears in the data.

56

00:03:18,540  -->  00:03:20,820
Let's click on it to make sure everything is fine.

57

00:03:21,060  -->  00:03:21,870
Okay perfect.

58

00:03:21,870  -->  00:03:26,830
We have our two columns annual income and spending score and our 200 observations.

59

00:03:27,270  -->  00:03:27,690
Perfect.

60

00:03:27,690  -->  00:03:29,640
So we completed our first step.

61

00:03:29,640  -->  00:03:31,420
So that's the end of this tutorial.

62

00:03:31,530  -->  00:03:34,640
And in the next tutorial things are going to get more interesting.

63

00:03:34,680  -->  00:03:39,240
We're going to use the DENTRO gram to find the optimal number of clusters and you're going to see what

64

00:03:39,240  -->  00:03:43,110
a danger a gram looks like in our thank you for watching this video.

65

00:03:43,140  -->  00:03:45,550
And I look forward to seeing you in the next tutorial
