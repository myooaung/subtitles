00:00:00,300  -->  00:00:02,740
Hello and welcome to this art tutorial.

2

00:00:03,030  -->  00:00:08,130
So in the previous tutorial we predicted our test results and now and just to tell you all we are going

3

00:00:08,130  -->  00:00:15,360
to evaluate those predictions by making the confusion matrix which will count the number of correct

4

00:00:15,360  -->  00:00:18,410
predictions and the number of incorrect predictions.

5

00:00:18,420  -->  00:00:20,180
So let's do it let's make the matrix.

6

00:00:20,190  -->  00:00:21,030
It's very simple.

7

00:00:21,030  -->  00:00:23,190
It will just take us one line.

8

00:00:23,400  -->  00:00:26,520
So let's call it C M equals.

9

00:00:26,820  -->  00:00:33,750
Then very practically We're going to use the table function in R and in the table I will first input

10

00:00:34,070  -->  00:00:42,520
the real values which are the test set brackets and then I have to select the columns of the real results

11

00:00:42,530  -->  00:00:49,170
which is if we go to the test set this column because this column contains the real results whether

12

00:00:49,500  -->  00:00:50,950
the use bought yes or no.

13

00:00:50,940  -->  00:00:53,840
The SUV and this column has an x 3.

14

00:00:53,940  -->  00:00:59,430
So here I will put come up and three.

15

00:00:59,430  -->  00:01:02,470
All right so that's my first argument that's the real values.

16

00:01:02,490  -->  00:01:08,520
And then as a second argument I'm going to input the predicted values which is of course the widespread

17

00:01:08,580  -->  00:01:09,990
vector here.

18

00:01:09,990  -->  00:01:17,220
So here I'm going to add y pred and I don't have to select an index because white bread is already the

19

00:01:17,220  -->  00:01:19,220
vector of predictions.

20

00:01:19,230  -->  00:01:24,620
So in short this is the vector of real values for all the observations.

21

00:01:24,840  -->  00:01:31,070
And this is the vector of predictions for the same observations as in this vector.

22

00:01:31,620  -->  00:01:33,100
OK and that's it.

23

00:01:33,300  -->  00:01:35,110
The confusion matrix is ready.

24

00:01:35,130  -->  00:01:38,510
So now let's select this line and execute.

25

00:01:38,670  -->  00:01:41,780
Here is table created.

26

00:01:41,790  -->  00:01:44,690
Now let's go to the console and have a look at it.

27

00:01:44,880  -->  00:01:46,770
CM.

28

00:01:47,390  -->  00:01:55,050
And here it is the most important thing to understand here is that the 57 and the 26 Here are the correct

29

00:01:55,170  -->  00:02:00,920
predictions and the 10 and the seven Here are the incorrect predictions.

30

00:02:00,930  -->  00:02:10,530
So what's interesting here at first sight is that the classifier made 57 plus 26 equals 83 correct predictions

31

00:02:10,890  -->  00:02:13,320
and 10 plus seven equals 17.

32

00:02:13,320  -->  00:02:14,950
Incorrect predictions.

33

00:02:14,970  -->  00:02:17,890
All right so 17 incorrect predictions on the test set.

34

00:02:18,120  -->  00:02:23,640
That's not bad but we can do better and we will do better with other classifiers.

35

00:02:23,640  -->  00:02:25,380
You'll see that in the next sections.

36

00:02:25,670  -->  00:02:28,160
OK so we're done with the confusion matrix.

37

00:02:28,530  -->  00:02:30,990
And finally now it's time for the best part.

38

00:02:31,050  -->  00:02:36,510
Because in the next tutorial we will be graphically looking at our results because we will plot this

39

00:02:36,510  -->  00:02:41,490
very cool chart that will allow us to make an awesome interpretation of the results.

40

00:02:41,520  -->  00:02:46,100
So I look forward to seeing you in the next tutorial where we will make this chart.

41

00:02:46,320  -->  00:02:48,060
Until then enjoy mission learning
