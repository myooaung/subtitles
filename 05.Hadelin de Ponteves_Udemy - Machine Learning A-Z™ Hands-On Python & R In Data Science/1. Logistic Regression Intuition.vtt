00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:06.320
Are right let's do this logistic regression intuition and you could probably tell by my voice that I'm

2
00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:07.460
pretty excited.

3
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.650
There's some very interesting slides coming up and this is quite an important topic.

4
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:18.300
But at the same time it is quite challenging so a quick heads up there will be some math and I've done

5
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:25.200
a few run through of this presentation already and I really will try my best to convey everything in

6
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.750
the simplest way possible.

7
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.710
So let's get into it.

8
00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.990
We already know about the linear regression.

9
00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.760
We know that there is a simple linear regression and it has a very short formula with one independent

10
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:36.570
variable.

11
00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.660
And we also have looked into the multiple linear regression which has many independent variables.

12
00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:50.580
So we already know how to deal with this type of challenge so when we have a scalpel like that where

13
00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.550
on the horizontal axis we've got the independent variable on the vertical axis.

14
00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.840
We've got the dependent variable and it's an example we looked at salary versus experience.

15
00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.310
How do we create a model here.

16
00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.190
So we use a simple linear regression.

17
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.970
It puts a line through our data and that line is modeling our observations.

18
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:18.710
So we can basically forecast things and compare our actual preservations to our model and so on.

19
00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.360
But so we know how to deal with challenges like that or problems like that.

20
00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.880
But your company had hired you as a data scientist.

21
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.950
What they do is they send out email offers to customers with like a proposal to buy certain products.

22
00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.040
It might be a clothing store it might be a grocery store or something.

23
00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:48.480
So what they do is basically they send out a offer in the in e-mail to a lot of customers to purchase

24
00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:49.180
product.

25
00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.780
And here you got a sample of those customers that they contacted recently you've got their age and also

26
00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.450
you have a variable whether or not they took action.

27
00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.180
So did the person take up an action to perform an action did they take up an offer.

28
00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.200
Did they buy a product.

29
00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.080
Did they open up an e-mail or respond to our e-mail and so on.

30
00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.530
So was the action taken or not.

31
00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.430
And the very black and white.

32
00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:11.970
Very different.

33
00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.650
But at the same time even though we don't know what to do We don't know what's going on here it's not

34
00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:22.300
what we're expecting but at the same time intuitively we can see that there is some sort of correlation.

35
00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:28.110
We can see that the observations on the bottom they're a bit more to the left observations on the top

36
00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:35.160
are a bit more to the right implying kind of that's probably older people are more likely to take action

37
00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.300
based on this offer.

38
00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.480
And younger people are more likely to ignore it.

39
00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.170
So can we somehow model this.

40
00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:49.710
How about we try our existing method in our toolkit which is the linear regression.

41
00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.210
Let's run Aleena aggression.

42
00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:52.500
And that's what it looks like.

43
00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:59.400
As you can tell it doesn't look like the best approach doesn't look like the best method to solve this

44
00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:00.210
problem.

45
00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:06.240
So let's look into this in a bit more detail.

46
00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.310
We're going to draw the other horizontal line over here.

47
00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:17.250
Instead of trying to predict exactly what's going to happen for any given person let's imagine a person

48
00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:23.520
and let's say we want to predict for that person knowing their age we want to predict whether they will

49
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.250
take up the offer or not.

50
00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.230
But instead of predicting exactly whether they're going to take it up or not.

51
00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:38.280
How about instead we will predict the probability rules will state a probability or a likelihood of

52
00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.110
that person taking up that offer.

53
00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:45.940
And if you think of it in that way right away things start becoming clearer right away you can see that.

54
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.710
OK so this chart is actually from 0 to 1.

55
00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:52.930
And I also know that probabilities are from 0 to 1.

56
00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:54.030
Oh that's interesting.

57
00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.370
So basically I could fit in probabilities between 0 and 1.

58
00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:02.970
The fact that the red dots the red observations are already either 0 1 and nowhere in between.

59
00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.150
Well that's simply because we already know the result.

60
00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:09.570
We already know that they're either there or there but for something that we're predicting it kind of

61
00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:16.460
makes sense to say well I don't know for sure I don't know 100 percent he'll take it up or not.

62
00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:19.990
By no maybe maybe an 80 percent chance he'll take it up or not.

63
00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:20.500
Right.

64
00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:25.860
And when you think of it that way the linear regression line or at least that part that's in the middle

65
00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:27.030
between 0 and 1.

66
00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:28.350
It makes sense right.

67
00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:35.670
Well it makes some sense because that is basically it's telling you that anybody between those ages

68
00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:40.560
of for instance where it's crossing the horizontal line for the first time it might be.

69
00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:45.500
Whereas Horten crossing the horizontal axis it might be like 25 or 35.

70
00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:51.630
And whereas crossing a vertical or horizontal axis for one it might be let's say 55.

71
00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:58.060
So those people between 35 and 55 they anything in-between.

72
00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:04.110
Any person that falls in between that age there is a probability of them taking up this offer and their

73
00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:10.290
probabilities is increasing as we move to the right as we take more and more older people are pre-build

74
00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:11.010
is increasing.

75
00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:16.230
So the part of the linear regression in the middle kind of makes sense and we we can do something with

76
00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:22.710
it but the parts that don't make sense at all are the ones at the top at the bottom because a probably

77
00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:24.200
can never be less than zero.

78
00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.470
It can never be above 1.

79
00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:29.200
So what is the linear regression trying to give us a hint about here.

80
00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:37.560
Well what it's probably saying what we could interpret as is that people above that age that nominal

81
00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:44.700
age we said 55 above that age they they are very very likely take off or actually more than more than

82
00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:45.390
100 percent.

83
00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:47.810
So basically they're definitely taking it up.

84
00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:53.540
Anybody below 35 on the other side on the left they're definitely not taking it.

85
00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:59.880
So essentially what we're saying is if we take that approach then we would have to replace the original

86
00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:04.320
line with a line that looks like that so let's just cut those bits off and replace them with horizontal

87
00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:14.950
parts and that would beer very basic but it still would be an attempt at creating a model for this situation.

88
00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:20.040
So we would still be able to use this to make some sort of predictions and assumptions.

89
00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:25.570
That's a lot that's talk about the correlation between the action and the age of a person.

90
00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:33.310
So that's a very basic understanding and that's kind of the start of our understanding of intuition

91
00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:35.170
behind logistic regression.

92
00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:39.330
So let's see what the actual scientific approaches.

93
00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:45.840
So here we've got the line that we looked at and it is described by this equation.

94
00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:49.360
Now this part is going to be this is the most fun parts of Beruf me.

95
00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:55.150
If you applied to this equation a sigmoid function which looks like that.

96
00:06:55.270 --> 00:07:03.950
So you put the Y into the sigmoid function in purple and then you solve for y from the purple box and

97
00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:08.020
you put y back into the blue box then you'll get the green box.

98
00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:12.590
So basically your linear regression will start to look like this.

99
00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:16.490
And this is the formula for logistic regression.

100
00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:24.550
And what that will do to chart which is most important is this visual part it all converted from the

101
00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:32.140
charter we see at the top to this new chart which is actually the logistic regression function.

102
00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:39.630
So if at this stage you're asking yourself what just happened then.

103
00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:40.950
You're not alone.

104
00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:46.840
The first time I saw this or I learned this this was the expression on my face.

105
00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:51.790
If you if you told me you feel totally comfortable for that that's super great that means you'll fly

106
00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:52.780
through this section.

107
00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:55.300
But if you're confused right now not a problem.

108
00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:57.670
I was the same when I was in your shoes.

109
00:07:57.730 --> 00:08:00.510
So let's take this step by step.

110
00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:03.790
Let's look at it step by step exactly what happened.

111
00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:12.190
So there's our graph there is our independent variable there is our outcome yes or no.

112
00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:15.310
So that's the why the dependent variable.

113
00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:20.390
And there are observations in our data set based on these observations.

114
00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:27.590
And plus using this formula which we're going to take as given this is the logistic regression formula.

115
00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:35.740
Using this formula and these observations we come up with this line and what is important to understand

116
00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:37.980
here it's not a magical line.

117
00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:45.850
This line for the logistic regression is the same as a slope or a trend line for a linear regression.

118
00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:53.500
So basically what this line is doing is it is using the formula is following a formula and it's the

119
00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:56.870
best fitting line that can fit these data.

120
00:08:56.870 --> 00:09:03.040
And so basically we doing exactly the same thing as a for linear regression but it just looks different

121
00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:03.550
that's all.

122
00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:08.770
So there there are heaps of these lines that can you can draw that look like that but only one of them

123
00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:10.020
is the best fitting line.

124
00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:14.440
So the point of the logistic regression is to find that best fitting line.

125
00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:15.580
And this is it.

126
00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:24.270
So we found the best fitting line that follows that equation and fits these variables that we.

127
00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:26.680
All these observations that we had in our data set.

128
00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:31.740
After that we can forget about the equation we forget about the variables we've got on line.

129
00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:36.120
So this is our logistic regression function we found it.

130
00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:40.190
Same thing as with the linear regression we've created the model we've built the model you can see it.

131
00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:43.040
This is the model in front of you right there.

132
00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:46.240
Now what can we do if this logistic regression.

133
00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:53.460
Well we can use it to predict probabilities and we're very touched on probabilities that they live between

134
00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:58.110
0 and 1 and that instead of predicting for sure that something will or will not happen.

135
00:09:58.110 --> 00:09:59.650
Hubble would predict probability.

136
00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:06.120
So let's look at oh by the way probability here is called p hat.

137
00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:13.360
So that that's a little sign about P gives it the name p hat and anything you see in the hat in the

138
00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:17.800
section just basically means that it's something we're predicting so.

139
00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:21.680
And that's that's a way to remember that picture.

140
00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:24.530
So we're predicting this probability.

141
00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:31.320
OK so let's take a for a random values for the independent variable for X.

142
00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:35.040
We're going to say 20 30 40 50 let's see what happens with variables.

143
00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:37.730
So let's put them on the X line.

144
00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:38.730
Those are the dots.

145
00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:45.570
And I specifically put dots not X's and crosses because it doesn't mean that they're on the horizontal

146
00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:52.110
The bottom line doesn't mean that their probability is zero or that they're dependent variable is 0

147
00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:52.370
and 0.

148
00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:57.400
They just there because they're on the x axis we just plotted them there has nothing to do with the

149
00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:59.550
vertical axis.

150
00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:04.950
Now let's what you need to do to find the probabilities is you need to project these values onto your

151
00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:05.600
curve.

152
00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:14.960
Once you project them you get these blue light blue blue dots or blue observations we plotted basically.

153
00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:19.520
So these are the fitted values as you remember in Grettel you have in red you have the actual And in

154
00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:21.130
blue you have the fitted values.

155
00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:23.420
So these are fitted values.

156
00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:29.540
And now if you project them if you want the probabilities you need to project them to the left like

157
00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:34.730
that and let's have a look at these possibilities so the person who's 20 years old the probability of

158
00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:36.450
taking up this offer is very low.

159
00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:43.600
Perhaps 0.7 percent so less than 1 percentage to take up this offer the person who's 30 years old.

160
00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:49.820
The percent probability is higher is about 23 percent take up this offer the person who's 40 years old

161
00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:52.130
they're probably take up the offers.

162
00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:57.440
Eighty five percent according to this model and the person who's 50 years old there probably is ninety

163
00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:59.060
nine point four percent.

164
00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:03.470
So that's the first thing that you can get out of a logistic regression.

165
00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:05.970
That's what we're going to be using very.

166
00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:11.780
We're going to be using it very actively when we're talking about building Joe demographic segmentation

167
00:12:11.810 --> 00:12:17.890
because you use this probability as a score and I will talk about this more so you can actually rank

168
00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:22.860
people who is the most likely to take up your friend who's the least likely to take you up.

169
00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:26.480
So it's actually even better than just having a one or a zero.

170
00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:33.830
You have a probability so you can order people by this possibility anyway you might want to say.

171
00:12:33.890 --> 00:12:35.460
Well I don't want probability.

172
00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:39.770
I want a prediction as well because this is a regression.

173
00:12:39.950 --> 00:12:43.720
I want a prediction for the the y value.

174
00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:46.010
So OK we can do that.

175
00:12:46.190 --> 00:12:50.380
Can we get let's get rid of those probabilities now.

176
00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:52.380
Can we get the why the actual.

177
00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:57.890
Obviously we can't get the actual Because the actual is something that we can only observe in our data

178
00:12:57.890 --> 00:12:59.200
set or in real life.

179
00:12:59.270 --> 00:13:01.320
We can only get a prediction for the actual.

180
00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:08.990
So white hat as it has suggests is a predictive value for the dependent variable.

181
00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:10.030
How do you get why.

182
00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:12.770
Well the approach is very arbitrary.

183
00:13:12.770 --> 00:13:14.640
You have to select a line.

184
00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:16.490
Let's wait for that archive.

185
00:13:16.610 --> 00:13:17.690
So you have to select a line.

186
00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:20.130
In this case we're going to check 50 percent.

187
00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:25.730
You can select it anywhere but 50 percent is jesús because it's in the middle and it's therefore you

188
00:13:25.730 --> 00:13:31.790
have symmetry and anything below this line so anything that falls on the curve below this line will

189
00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:34.330
be projected downwards onto the zero line.

190
00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:41.100
Which makes sense so it's basically saying if you operability your predicted probability of taking up

191
00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:45.240
this offer is less than 50 percent let's say it's 40 percent or 20 percent then we're just going to

192
00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:48.470
say that you're not you're probably not going to take up this offer.

193
00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:50.550
And so that's what's happening.

194
00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:58.890
The person we're 0.7 percent the person or whatever it was 27 percent 23 percent their predicted their

195
00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:06.450
probabilities are not zero but they're below 50 so you're if you're if you're if you do require a y

196
00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:13.080
hat so a predicted value a yes or no value then makes sense that if something is below 50 percent you're

197
00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:16.490
probably going to say that they're not going to take up the offer now.

198
00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:17.630
And you think wow.

199
00:14:17.770 --> 00:14:18.050
Yeah.

200
00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:19.890
So they know both of them.

201
00:14:19.890 --> 00:14:28.770
Why has a zero now anything above the horizontal line that was selected the 50 percent line it is agreed

202
00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:35.220
that all of those values that fall onto the curve above that line are projected upwards they're projected

203
00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:38.340
onto the yes like the one what line.

204
00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:44.730
So the person that had a possibility of 85 percent is projected outwards and the person that had the

205
00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:48.150
possibility of ninety nine point seven percent picked it up and also make sense right.

206
00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:54.390
So if she if somebody is going to cha you predicting that somebody is possibility of taking up an offer

207
00:14:54.390 --> 00:14:59.250
of 85 percent then if you have to say yes or no then you're probably going to say yes you're going to

208
00:14:59.250 --> 00:15:04.440
say yes this person will take up the offer if you just if you have to choose one of the two.

209
00:15:04.590 --> 00:15:13.130
So those are our predicted y hat values in this case they're both one for those two variables.

210
00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:21.630
And those are the two things you can get out of you know logistic regression so you get the probabilities

211
00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:25.550
which are important also you can get the Y had predicted values for the dependent variables.

212
00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:30.940
Once again it's important to think of it as it's doing exactly the same thing as a linear regression.

213
00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:31.320
It's

214
00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:37.220
it's fitting this line even though it's not a straight line.

215
00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:41.370
And the and the values are not scattered.

216
00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:48.720
Everything looks bizarre in its uniformity or in the structure its structure makes it look very bizarre

217
00:15:48.930 --> 00:15:57.510
but still it's it's a pretty much the same way we've agreed on a line or a formula for a curve and we're

218
00:15:57.510 --> 00:16:00.070
trying to fit the best curve to our daughter.

219
00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:05.340
Once we've done that we've got we've got a model we've got the coefficients which we'll talk about later

220
00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:13.530
and we can start drawing conclusions or insights from this model and some of the insights are we can

221
00:16:13.530 --> 00:16:20.910
get a probability of somebody taking action or of the event occurring and or basically the answer being

222
00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:27.120
yes so it's not a yes no it's a probability so 85 percent or 20 percent or whatever so that's when we

223
00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:29.440
projected to the left onto the y axis.

224
00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:35.520
And also we can get a predicted value for the depende Berbel based on where we select this arbitrary

225
00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:42.270
line 50 percent you can select it anywhere you like you can say a higher or lower depends on your knowledge

226
00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:44.140
about the problem at hand.

227
00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:50.460
And as you as you understand depending on where you selected that will significantly affect your variables.

228
00:16:50.490 --> 00:17:00.710
So I really hope this explanation was trivial enough and yet insightful enough for you to gain an intuitive

229
00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:02.760
understanding of logistic regression.

230
00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:05.990
I look forward to seeing you then and until next time happy analyzing.
