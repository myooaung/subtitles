00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.370
Hello my friends and welcome to this new part on association rule learning.

2
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.620
In this part we're going to cover a new way of learning relationships you know correlations.

3
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:17.730
And this time what we will learn is some association rules you know like that famous statement people

4
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.220
who bought this also bought that you know that's what Amazon for example does and its recommendation

5
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.120
system it predicts what customers will buy based on what they bought before.

6
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.340
And that's why you see all these suggestions of new products when you buy a certain product.

7
00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.340
Well and this new part I'm going to teach you how to make a model that can do these kind of things.

8
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.850
All right.

9
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.220
And that is called association rural learning so it's very different actually than what we had before

10
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.510
you know before we were either predicting a dependent variable and we knew what to predict.

11
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.210
We also did clustering where we learned some patterns in the data so as to create a new dependent variable

12
00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:55.280
epistolary.

13
00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.290
And now what we're going to learn is some association rules inside and in symbol of transactions.

14
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:01.890
All right.

15
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:07.350
So very useful especially for retail businesses or any kind of e-commerce.

16
00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.560
So if you are data scientists working for an e-commerce company you will definitely use it.

17
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.760
And if you are yourself you know a business owner of a retail company or an e-commerce company then

18
00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.400
you will definitely benefit from it as well.

19
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.000
All right.

20
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.900
So let's do this.

21
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.360
Let's start to learn this new technique.

22
00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.130
And before we start let's just make sure everyone here is on the same page.

23
00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.310
This is a folder containing all the codes and data sets of discourse.

24
00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.870
And I give you the link to this folder right before this story.

25
00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.080
So make sure not to miss it click it.

26
00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.510
And now we should all be on the same page.

27
00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:40.750
All right so let's do this.

28
00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:46.980
Let's get into Part Five association rule learning and we are going to cover two morals.

29
00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:52.710
The first one a primary which is actually the best one of the two issue in my opinion and Ella and of

30
00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.960
course we're going to start with a primary and we're going to start here with Python.

31
00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:58.470
All right.

32
00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:04.980
So insiders by them follow you will find as usual the implementation a primary that IPO and B which

33
00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.880
you can open with either Google collaboratively or Japan and notebook.

34
00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:15.390
And of course you will find the data set which is called Market Basket optimization because actually

35
00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:21.610
association with learning is used to market basket analysis or optimization.

36
00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.820
That's why I called this data set this way.

37
00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:24.180
All right.

38
00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.950
So speaking of which let's describe what this dataset is about.

39
00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.800
All right so for starters let's imagine the beautiful region of south of France you know with all these

40
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.930
cute villages with happy people walking down the streets and going to the grocery store every now and

41
00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.810
then or to the coffee places.

42
00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:47.490
Well you know imagine a very lively place where people hang out a lot and love go into the different

43
00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:52.470
shops the different Commerce's not only to buy their favorite product but also to you know chill out

44
00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.240
and the beautiful lovely town.

45
00:02:54.240 --> 00:03:00.390
And imagine that you are the business owner of one of these stores you know selling food and delicious

46
00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.970
stuff.

47
00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.580
And so you know you are the business owner of this shop and you would like to as any business owners

48
00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:12.320
optimize and boost the sales and you have an idea it is to offer some new great deals to your customers.

49
00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:19.050
And the deal idea that you have in mind is to identify you know the best association rules among the

50
00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.940
different products but by your customers in order to offer you know this very famous deal.

51
00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.050
Buy this and get that for free.

52
00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:29.820
You know if you buy this product you're going to get that product for free.

53
00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:30.540
All right.

54
00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:36.780
And so now you see the idea we're going to use Association wool learning to find the strongest rules

55
00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:43.350
saying if customers buy this product then they will have a high chance to buy that other product.

56
00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:49.020
And we will measure that chance so that in fact if they get this product they will very likely want

57
00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.680
this other product and therefore they will very likely get that deal.

58
00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.750
Get this product and get that one for free.

59
00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.140
All right so that's what this owner would like to do.

60
00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:03.690
And this owner just hired the best data scientist of thousand friends which means you of course to do

61
00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:09.720
the job you know to find these association rules and therefore what this owner did because he knows

62
00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:14.460
a little bit about data science he knows that he has to collect some data to provide the data scientists

63
00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:15.890
in order to learn these rules.

64
00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:22.320
And so each week this owner collect all the different transactions of the customers and at the end of

65
00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:27.780
the week you're given this list of transactions which you have in front of you so that you can learn

66
00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:32.850
that association rules and return the best deals that this owner should offer to the client.

67
00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:33.370
All right.

68
00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:34.530
That's your mission.

69
00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:41.070
You have to identify the best deals so as to maximize the chance that you know the customers will get

70
00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:44.550
the deals you know will buy the spirit and get another one for free.

71
00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:49.910
And of course the price of this by this get one for free will be well calculated by the owner.

72
00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.120
But that's a different question.

73
00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:56.070
So that it can indeed not only optimize the sales but also the profit.

74
00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.750
All right.

75
00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:58.410
So that's the mission.

76
00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:01.420
And now let's make sure everyone understands the data set.

77
00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:08.850
You know each row of the data set corresponds to different transactions from different customers actually.

78
00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:14.370
And for each of these transactions you have all the different products that the customer who did the

79
00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:15.930
transaction purchased.

80
00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:16.350
All right.

81
00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:22.800
So for example this first transaction corresponds to a certain customer who put in one basket some shrimps

82
00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.770
some almonds avocado vegetable mix green grapes etc..

83
00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:29.000
Up to you know olive oil.

84
00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:35.000
All right then this customer or you know this transaction corresponds to a customer who bought in one

85
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.350
same basket some burgers meatballs and x.

86
00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:38.930
All right.

87
00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:41.220
This customer just bought chutney.

88
00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:42.090
This first customer.

89
00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:44.470
But Turkey avocado and et cetera.

90
00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:45.170
Right.

91
00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:51.270
So all these transactions correspond to different customers and all these different transactions there

92
00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:52.520
are actually many of them.

93
00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.970
They're actually 7500.

94
00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:56.590
You know if we scroll down up to the end.

95
00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:03.820
Yes 7500 and these seven thousand five 7500 transactions were collected during the whole week.

96
00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.450
You know each week the owner of the shop does this.

97
00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:12.780
He records all the transactions and he gives them to you Data Scientist so that you can learn the association

98
00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:17.040
rules all right and your mission is to return to this owner as fast as possible.

99
00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:22.860
Well the best association rules you know of two elements so that this owner can find the best deals

100
00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:24.120
for his clients.

101
00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:25.350
All right good.

102
00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:28.780
So now that we clearly understand the data set.

103
00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:33.260
Well I suggest that we move on directly to the implementation.

104
00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:39.450
So we're going to go back to our folder and we're going to open this primary that IPO and be either

105
00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:43.350
with Google collaboratively or duplicate notebook as you want.

106
00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:44.520
Choose your favorite.

107
00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:45.440
Now it is loading.

108
00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:50.330
It is laying out the notebook and in a second will have it opened.

109
00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:50.640
All right.

110
00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:51.330
Perfect.

111
00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:58.150
So as usual this notebook is an read only mode and therefore what we're all going to do now is go to

112
00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:02.970
fall here to create a copy by clicking here on Save a copy in drive.

113
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.760
This will create a copy inside which we will be able to re implement that file from scratch.

114
00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:09.540
All right.

115
00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:12.500
Because I remind that discourse is an action based course.

116
00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:15.020
I want all of you to learn by doing.

117
00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:19.030
Because this is how you will maximize your progress in machine learning.

118
00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:19.440
OK.

119
00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:25.590
So now again as usual let's remove all the code cells you know only the good sales so that we can keep

120
00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:28.530
the well highlighted structure of this implementation.

121
00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:30.810
So don't remove the tech sales here.

122
00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:31.350
All right.

123
00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:35.020
So there are a few code sales but we should be done soon.

124
00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:36.550
This should be the last one.

125
00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:37.920
No one that's one.

126
00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:39.420
And there we go.

127
00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:39.980
All right good.

128
00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:42.000
We see the whole structure in one pitch.

129
00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:43.210
Let's have a look.

130
00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:45.690
So first we import the libraries as usual.

131
00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:50.580
You notice that I kept my diary depressing template because we will actually use it a bit at least you

132
00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:51.820
know the first cells.

133
00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:54.150
Then we have the data repricing phase.

134
00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:54.870
There you go.

135
00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:56.370
That's inevitable.

136
00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:02.190
Then we're going to train the primary model on the data set and then we're going to visualize the results.

137
00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:08.220
And by visualizing the results here I mean you know visualize all the different rules sorted by relevance

138
00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:09.410
as you can see.

139
00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:15.390
Well first display the results meaning the rules non sorted and then the results meaning the rules sorted

140
00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:21.210
by descending lifts you know lift is that metric of measuring the relevance of an association rule which

141
00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:23.600
you saw in the intuition lectures with zero.

142
00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:28.680
So you see we're going to display the rules by descending lives so that we can see the most relevant

143
00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:33.090
and therefore the ones having the highest chance to convert the customers.

144
00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:34.710
All right so that's the structure.

145
00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:41.070
And now whenever you're ready let's meet in a next material to start this implementation it will be

146
00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:42.540
a very exciting new journey.

147
00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:44.430
I can't wait to implement tomorrow with you.

148
00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:46.200
And until then enjoy machine learning.
