00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:00.990
Hello my friends.

2
00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:06.780
My name is Alan the point of us and it is my great pleasure to welcome you onboard into this course.

3
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:12.060
I am one of the two instructors here with whom you will be doing all the practical activities inside

4
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:16.770
which together we will build all the different machinery models of this course.

5
00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.150
So congratulations again for taking this course.

6
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:26.730
And now before we start all the practical activities I just want to make sure that everyone follow these

7
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.280
instructions that were just given to you right before this tutorial so that we can all be ready to code

8
00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:34.130
the machinery models right.

9
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.630
It is important that we do this because I really don't want any of you to have technical issue or to

10
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:44.290
be blocked on something I want here everyone to learn machine learning smoothly.

11
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.040
So in this tutorial I'm going to make sure that everyone followed the instructions here so that we can

12
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.540
all be ready to start coding.

13
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.650
All right so let's just follow the instructions here.

14
00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:55.680
Step by step.

15
00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.710
The first thing I asked you to do was to click the link of the folder containing all the python codes

16
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.980
our code and data sets of this course.

17
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:05.190
So let's do this first.

18
00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.580
Let's click this link.

19
00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:12.690
This link redirects you to indeed the whole machine learning is that folder with all the codes and data

20
00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:13.850
set here.

21
00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.800
I made sure to connect from a different Gmail account so that we can have the same page.

22
00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.260
So you should get a shared with me folder which is of course this machine learning.

23
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.730
It is that folder.

24
00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.910
Now don't worry if you have trouble accessing this folder that probably is because you don't have a

25
00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:36.150
G.M. account so I really encourage you to create and sign into a G.M. account and if you can't do this

26
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.990
don't worry.

27
00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.800
I have an alternative solution for you which I'll explain at the end of this story.

28
00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.690
All right.

29
00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.340
So here we are all on the same page.

30
00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.330
Then let's see what I wanted you to do that next thing is an important note.

31
00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:53.880
Number one I asked you to please download this folder on your machine in order to get all the files

32
00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.890
especially the datasets which we will have to upload when training the machine learning models.

33
00:01:58.890 --> 00:01:59.940
All right so let's do this.

34
00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:01.230
I'm going to show you how to do it.

35
00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:06.570
In case anyone missed it in order to download this folder it's very simple you just need to click that

36
00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.910
little error here and then click download and this will download your folder it is not a big folder

37
00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.950
because it only contains codes and data set.

38
00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:20.460
So at first it's going to zip the file and then it's going to download it very quickly.

39
00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.080
All right it should just take a few seconds and there we go download ready.

40
00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.040
Now it is downloaded and all good.

41
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.490
Perfect.

42
00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.770
So I'm going to close this tab and now I'm going to show you what we got.

43
00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.100
I'm going to go to my download folder here it is.

44
00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.710
This is what was just downloaded this machinery.

45
00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:39.610
It is it folder.

46
00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.610
So let's unzip it and just double clicked to unzip it and here it is.

47
00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.440
So I always like to put it on my desktop.

48
00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.890
So there you go.

49
00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:49.980
Let's go to my desktop.

50
00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.300
And here is the whole machinery.

51
00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.920
It is that folder containing all the different branches of machine learning you know structure in these

52
00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.060
10 parts.

53
00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.730
And in each part you will find the different machine learning models of the part because each part actually

54
00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:08.210
corresponds to a specific branch of mission learning each one corresponding to a different type of predictions.

55
00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:13.530
For example in regression we're going to predict a continuous real number in classification we're going

56
00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.270
to predict a category in clustering we're going to identify some patterns in the data.

57
00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:21.210
So you see all these are different branches of machine learning.

58
00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:27.330
And so in each of these branches you will find all the major machinery morals and in each machine learning

59
00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:33.710
model folder you will find two folders Python containing the python implementations and are containing

60
00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:39.510
the are implementations and in each of them you will find the same data set with which we will build

61
00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.390
and train the machinery model.

62
00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.570
All right so it is all structured the same way here.

63
00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:50.220
So you will find everything you will find the data sets the python codes and all codes and so make sure

64
00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:55.400
to have this folder because indeed whenever we build machinery morals we will have to upload the data

65
00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.420
set within the implementation.

66
00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:58.980
So we'll get to that later.

67
00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.360
I can't wait to start by the way.

68
00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.680
I'm really excited to show you how we're going to build all these models.

69
00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.330
And now let's follow the rest of the instructions.

70
00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:10.610
I'm going to go back to the link of the Google Drive folder.

71
00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:11.350
There we go.

72
00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:16.840
And now let's go back to this article which you just saw in the previous toil and let's read important

73
00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:17.620
note number two.

74
00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:24.010
So important note number two is only for Python coders because now I'm going to explain how to open

75
00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:29.800
the python files of this folder with Google collaborator and I will give a short introduction to Google

76
00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:30.690
collaborator.

77
00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:36.220
All right so here I specify that indeed you have to sign into your e-mail account otherwise you won't

78
00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.900
be able to open directly the Google collaborate re fouls.

79
00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:44.560
So indeed if you're signed into your email account this will automatically open this folder on your

80
00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:50.150
Google Drive which will indeed allow you to open the python files with Google collaboratively.

81
00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.930
So I'm going to show you this right away by the way.

82
00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.690
Here I am on a separate G.M. account.

83
00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:01.360
So it's exactly as if I was a student with you know a different criminal account than the one from which

84
00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:02.940
I hosted all these folders.

85
00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:06.820
So normally if you're signed into your original account we should all get the same thing.

86
00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:09.510
So for example let's go to part two regression.

87
00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:14.710
Then let's go to simple linear regression that's a very simple machinery model which will actually be

88
00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.010
the first machinery model we will build.

89
00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:22.210
Then let's go to python because now indeed I want to introduce you to google collaboratively which is

90
00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:25.630
to me the best platform to start with to code in Python.

91
00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:26.380
And there you go.

92
00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:30.160
So that's the data set and that's the Python implementation.

93
00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:37.240
This Python implementation has as you can see the IP Y and the format which means I Python notebook

94
00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:43.690
and therefore that means that you can only open this file in either Julia notebook which is a very famous

95
00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:47.130
idea to code in Python or Google collaboratively.

96
00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:52.690
And we're going to choose Google collaboratively for the simple reason that we can get a quick and direct

97
00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:55.960
access to our Python implementations.

98
00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.910
By that I mean that we don't have to install anything.

99
00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:04.690
You know we don't have to install any software and we don't have to install any package or library inside

100
00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:07.110
because everything is already pre installed.

101
00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:08.350
So that's the beauty of it.

102
00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:13.630
In order to code in Python you don't have to do anything you just need to double click this file and

103
00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:19.240
then as you can see you can just directly open this file with Google collaboratively.

104
00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:20.470
And that's really the beauty of it.

105
00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:25.890
And then you know we won't have to install any package we won't have to install the data science libraries

106
00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:32.080
like tens of so I could learn everything is already reinstalled so that's why I really want you to start

107
00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:37.210
with Google cola because indeed this will be so easy for you to get started with Python.

108
00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:37.870
All right.

109
00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:43.600
So that's the implementation of the simple linear regression model with all the different steps which

110
00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:46.180
of course we're going to re implement from scratch.

111
00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:47.190
Step by step.

112
00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:48.600
But that's for later.

113
00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:51.040
And now I just want to say something important.

114
00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:57.790
This file is in read only mode which means that we can't modify this bout right now but of course don't

115
00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:02.920
worry I'm gonna show you right away how you can create a copy of this file in which you will be able

116
00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:08.790
to indeed modify it and these will be explained again and again each time we build a new machinery model

117
00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:11.080
like this one simple in our regression.

118
00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:11.310
All right.

119
00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:14.740
So as I said this is an read only mode therefore you can't modify it.

120
00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:18.710
Right now you see I am trying to press enter and nothing happens to come modify it.

121
00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:27.190
However in order to modify it you just need to click file here and then save a copy in drive and by

122
00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:33.970
clicking this as you can see this will create a copy of this Google collaboratively file in which you

123
00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:38.000
will be able to modify their code and run it mostly.

124
00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:43.080
All right so now if I click this and I press enter into I can modify this file.

125
00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:43.550
All right.

126
00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:45.630
And you can also run it right.

127
00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:47.730
I'm running the first cell here.

128
00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:48.340
There you go.

129
00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:53.740
So if I click this you see that this cell was run but once again that's all for later we will re implement

130
00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:58.160
everything on Google collab and you will see that this will be super easy and super smooth.

131
00:07:58.720 --> 00:07:58.970
All right.

132
00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:02.300
So now you know everything you are introduced to Google collab.

133
00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:07.570
So once again I recommend to use Google collab for three reasons one because of course it is a free

134
00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:10.310
and open source Jupiter notebook environment.

135
00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:15.030
Second you don't have to install any software you can just click the link from the folder.

136
00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:22.150
And third old data science libraries packages like tens of flows I could learn anything is already pre

137
00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:26.660
installed so you won't have any trouble or any worry installing anything.

138
00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:28.700
And that's really the beauty of it.

139
00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:29.190
All right.

140
00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:30.430
So that was Google collab.

141
00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:34.840
And now final note on the instructions that were given to you just before.

142
00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:36.040
Let's see.

143
00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:38.620
Important note number three still for Python coders.

144
00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:43.630
So I understand that some of you can have a G.M. account because maybe you're working from your company

145
00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:47.000
or you know you just don't like Google so I totally respect that.

146
00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:48.230
And if that's the case.

147
00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:53.380
Well you know if you don't want to code on Google collaboratively and prefer to code on another Python

148
00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:57.850
idea like Djibril notebook or spider in Anaconda that's totally fine.

149
00:08:57.850 --> 00:09:03.780
I'm going to guide you now on how to do this and for all other people if you're happy with Google collaboratively.

150
00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:08.480
Well you can just skip this tutorial and move on to the next one where you will will teach you how to

151
00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:13.460
install ah and if you don't want to work on ah and just on Python while you can directly move on to

152
00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:17.390
the practical activities with part 1 they will be processing.

153
00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:17.750
All right.

154
00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:20.830
And for the rest of you now who wants to work on another idea.

155
00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:24.740
And Google up then please watch the end of this tutorial and let us do this.

156
00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:29.390
So important note number three was that indeed if you don't want to go on Google collaboratively and

157
00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:34.700
prefer a code on another Python idea like Jupiter notebook or spider in Anaconda you can find all the

158
00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:40.230
IPA in the files and the P Y files in the folder attached at the bottom of this oracle.

159
00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:45.670
This one so you just have to scroll down and then click this folder to download it.

160
00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:48.470
As you can see it is downloading it already downloaded.

161
00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:51.630
Perfect And so now I'm going to show you what we just got.

162
00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:57.710
I'm gonna close this gonna go to my download folder so that the old ones I'm going to put that back

163
00:09:57.710 --> 00:09:58.420
in.

164
00:09:58.430 --> 00:09:59.590
This is my down folder.

165
00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:00.920
This is what we just downloaded.

166
00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:03.050
I'm gonna put that in my desktop.

167
00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:03.620
There we go.

168
00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:06.120
I'm going to unzip it do the same.

169
00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:08.840
And now here is a folder that is a whole machinery.

170
00:10:08.830 --> 00:10:11.120
It is a folder with the same codes and data sets.

171
00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:16.490
However this time you will get in each moral and in each Python folder.

172
00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:22.520
Well not only the IP within in the implementation you know for Jupiter and notebook or Google collaboratively

173
00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:30.500
but also the p wide Python implementation in that P Y format with which you can you know code in Python

174
00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:33.050
on Spider or the classic terminal.

175
00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:35.030
And speaking of spider Ojibwe the notebook.

176
00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:39.800
Well that's what I'm gonna show you right away in order to code on these platforms which are different

177
00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:41.330
than Google laboratory.

178
00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:43.140
Well let me show you how to do this.

179
00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:45.810
So we're gonna have to go back to Google.

180
00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:52.750
Then here we're gonna type an R conduct because that's the whole platform that contains Jupiter notebook

181
00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:53.780
and Spider.

182
00:10:53.780 --> 00:11:00.610
We're gonna click the first link then we're gonna click download and then you know make sure to choose

183
00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:03.640
your right system Windows MapQuest or Linux.

184
00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:04.330
I'm on my quest.

185
00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:08.920
I'm gonna go here then you just need to click download here make sure to download Python three point

186
00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:11.880
seven and not Python 2.0 then download.

187
00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:12.880
Here it is now.

188
00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:17.530
Downloading Anaconda I should just take a few seconds 15 seconds.

189
00:11:17.530 --> 00:11:18.720
13 10.

190
00:11:18.730 --> 00:11:20.630
All right so we're gonna get it very soon.

191
00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:23.830
Six seconds left.

192
00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:27.820
Four three two one.

193
00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:28.750
Good.

194
00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:30.050
There we go.

195
00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:30.520
Perfect.

196
00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:31.340
We have it.

197
00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:34.040
So now I'm gonna go back to my download folder.

198
00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:35.080
Here it is.

199
00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:42.260
This is the file so you just double click on it to execute it then continue and then you just click

200
00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:46.430
continue continue continue all the time agree install.

201
00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:50.380
So I'm not going to click install here because Anaconda is already installed on my machine.

202
00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:54.980
But you know you won't have any issue you just need to go up to the end and this will be installed very

203
00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:55.580
quickly.

204
00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:55.960
All right.

205
00:11:55.970 --> 00:12:01.640
So I'm just gonna close this and now once it's installed well you will find it in your programs.

206
00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:08.510
So on Mac you just have to go to your applications and then there you go you double click on the navigator.

207
00:12:08.510 --> 00:12:18.700
This will open Anaconda and inside which you will find as you will see several Python I.D. even are

208
00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:24.730
by the way on which you can run all the python files that are in this folder that we just downloaded

209
00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:26.120
from the bottom of this oracle.

210
00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:28.260
So let's start with Juba notebook.

211
00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:29.710
You just need to click launch here.

212
00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:32.300
This will launch it and here it is.

213
00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:33.530
Here is Juba notebook.

214
00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:35.810
So now you are actually on your mission.

215
00:12:35.810 --> 00:12:37.810
These are the folders of your computer.

216
00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:42.510
So you're just gonna go to the folder where you unzipped this machine learning it is at folder.

217
00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:44.540
So remember I put it on my desktop.

218
00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:51.800
So I click desktop here then ok to let to give access then this is the machinery it is it for the with

219
00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:52.840
all the codes and data sets.

220
00:12:52.850 --> 00:12:54.170
That was just unzipped.

221
00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:59.960
So let's go inside and then let us take for example part two regression in simple in our regression

222
00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:06.470
and of course then python because we are on a python idea and then let's just open simple linear regression

223
00:13:06.650 --> 00:13:08.460
that IP Wendy.

224
00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:09.290
And there you go.

225
00:13:09.290 --> 00:13:13.580
That's the python file which again you can run and get exactly the same results here.

226
00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:15.080
So I'm just going to show you.

227
00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:18.740
We can click this button here to run.

228
00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:19.070
All right.

229
00:13:19.070 --> 00:13:20.420
So this was executed.

230
00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:21.140
Good.

231
00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:22.990
Now we import a dataset.

232
00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:25.940
Now we split the datasets into the training set in the test set.

233
00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:31.580
Now we train the simple in our regression model and the training set then we predict the test results

234
00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:35.220
and then we plot the results.

235
00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:36.190
And there you go.

236
00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:36.560
All right.

237
00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:38.290
So everything is executed.

238
00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:43.160
We plotted the training that results and the test results you see the numbers here mean that the cells

239
00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:44.090
were executed.

240
00:13:44.090 --> 00:13:45.740
All right so that should be the notebook.

241
00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:50.250
And lastly I'm going to show you how to execute the python files if you just prefer them.

242
00:13:50.270 --> 00:13:51.080
So let's do this.

243
00:13:51.170 --> 00:13:53.210
I'm going to go back to here.

244
00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:54.960
I'm going to launch spider now.

245
00:13:55.010 --> 00:14:01.280
This is the recommended idea to run the python files and actually I'm going to code some of the Python

246
00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:04.430
files in this machine running a course on spider.

247
00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:05.410
So let's do this.

248
00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:06.400
Welcome to spider.

249
00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:08.870
That's where you're gonna code your implementations.

250
00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:11.230
That's where you're going to find your files.

251
00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:13.970
Look at the variables you create of your implementation.

252
00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:16.310
Some help window and your plots.

253
00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:19.040
And this is where the code will be executed.

254
00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:20.780
You know the python console.

255
00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:27.230
So very simply in order to execute a Python implementation will we just had to go to file and then open

256
00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:33.530
to open a new file and then well we're gonna go to you know this desktop folder where I put the machinery

257
00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:36.630
into that folder and we're going to go for example to aggression.

258
00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:40.410
Let's take the same examples simple in our regression python.

259
00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:41.780
And there you go.

260
00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:49.670
Simple linear regression open now in files let make sure that we're also in the same folder that contains

261
00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:50.720
the set.

262
00:14:50.810 --> 00:14:54.660
So part of regression simple in our regression python.

263
00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:56.120
And there you go.

264
00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:57.420
And now you can just close this.

265
00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:01.330
Make sure that you took the P Y file right and that this one IP Wendy.

266
00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:03.870
And now there you can just execute everything.

267
00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:09.590
So in order to execute the code well what I like to do is do it code section by code section.

268
00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:16.430
So here I just did the first one I used the shortcut command or control for Windows users plus end to

269
00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:17.430
execute.

270
00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:20.450
Now let's run the second section.

271
00:15:20.450 --> 00:15:24.580
There you go and import the data set because here we are in the right folder.

272
00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:27.700
Now let's execute the third code section by the way of course.

273
00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:31.910
All these will be explained step by step and we will re implement everything.

274
00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:33.460
So executing this.

275
00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:37.610
Now this one to build and train the model.

276
00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:40.230
Now this one to make some predictions.

277
00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:40.700
All right.

278
00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:46.160
Everything goes smoothly and this one where we're going to see something plotted in the console or actually

279
00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:47.780
in a separate window.

280
00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:49.190
And there you go to several windows.

281
00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:52.670
That's the regression line with the predictions compared to the real result.

282
00:15:52.670 --> 00:15:54.820
So all this once again will be explained step by step.

283
00:15:54.830 --> 00:15:58.590
But you see you have many options to run your python files.

284
00:15:58.610 --> 00:16:04.670
I gave you the three Google collaborator re Jupiter notebook or spider and my personal recommendation

285
00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:10.000
is to run them on Google color because you won't have anything to install not any package not in your

286
00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.910
library not any dependency.

287
00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:15.420
Everything is ready for you to plug and play with the models.

288
00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:15.850
All right.

289
00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:17.690
So that's it for this material.

290
00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:23.610
I hope you managed to choose your favorite idea and I'm going to start by coding on Google collab.

291
00:16:23.690 --> 00:16:25.370
Then I will go a little bit on Spider.

292
00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:31.120
And then for deep learning of course code back in Google Code AB again because tensor flow is already

293
00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:35.230
installed and all the deep learning libraries already installed.

294
00:16:35.290 --> 00:16:36.190
So there you go.

295
00:16:36.190 --> 00:16:38.710
Now I'm super excited because we're gonna start soon.

296
00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:42.940
The practical activities and we will start with part 1 data processing.

297
00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:45.880
So I can't wait to begin the real journey.

298
00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:47.820
And until then enjoy machine learning.
