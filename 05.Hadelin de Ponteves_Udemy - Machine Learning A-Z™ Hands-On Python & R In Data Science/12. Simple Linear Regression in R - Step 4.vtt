00:00:00.300  -->  00:00:02.510
Hello and welcome to this art Tauriel.

2

00:00:02.790  -->  00:00:04.770
So now it's time for the fun part.

3

00:00:04.770  -->  00:00:08.590
I can't wait to show you the training set results and the tests that result.

4

00:00:08.850  -->  00:00:11.750
So let's start to build the graphs.

5

00:00:12.450  -->  00:00:18.540
So the first thing we're going to do is to import the GGP to library which is a very good way of putting

6

00:00:18.540  -->  00:00:19.660
something in our.

7

00:00:19.710  -->  00:00:21.500
So I'm going to import it.

8

00:00:21.690  -->  00:00:26.280
But before importing this library there might be some of you who are starting or for the first time

9

00:00:26.290  -->  00:00:32.910
so if we go to our packages here you can see that the GG plot two libraries here on my our studio but

10

00:00:32.910  -->  00:00:38.130
it might not be the case for you because that would mean that the GGP to a library is not installed

11

00:00:38.190  -->  00:00:38.950
on your car.

12

00:00:39.180  -->  00:00:45.530
So just for those of you for which it's the case I'm going to install GGP to library.

13

00:00:45.720  -->  00:00:54.170
So we have to use this command install packages here and then in parenthesis we add GGP plot to g g

14

00:00:54.730  -->  00:01:01.830
a lot to then we select this press command and control us enter to execute.

15

00:01:01.830  -->  00:01:05.940
And here as you can see it's installing the library and that's done.

16

00:01:06.160  -->  00:01:11.640
So that's the message you should be obtaining when you install a package.

17

00:01:11.670  -->  00:01:13.880
Now it should be appearing in your library.

18

00:01:13.900  -->  00:01:18.700
So mine is here and we are ready to start plotting the graph.

19

00:01:18.780  -->  00:01:20.820
I'm just going to put that in comment.

20

00:01:21.300  -->  00:01:23.300
So command shift Plessey.

21

00:01:23.370  -->  00:01:27.290
Now it's incoming because once it's installed we don't need to install it again.

22

00:01:27.840  -->  00:01:32.710
OK so now let's start to plot our training set resolves Grof.

23

00:01:32.880  -->  00:01:33.410
So.

24

00:01:33.430  -->  00:01:33.760
OK.

25

00:01:33.780  -->  00:01:38.390
So first thing we need to do is you can see the GG plot to library is not selected here.

26

00:01:38.400  -->  00:01:44.610
So we wanted to select it but we want to automate all this if we want to use simple aggression on another

27

00:01:44.610  -->  00:01:45.480
data set.

28

00:01:45.510  -->  00:01:51.630
So we will just type your library then in parenthesis the name of the library not in code.

29

00:01:51.630  -->  00:01:53.720
Actually G.G. plus 2.

30

00:01:54.030  -->  00:02:00.570
And as you can see if I select this line and executes here you see that it's not selected and if I execute

31

00:02:01.440  -->  00:02:06.950
it's selected he would just have a suggestion to type suppress package started messages to eliminate

32

00:02:06.960  -->  00:02:08.500
package started messages.

33

00:02:08.770  -->  00:02:10.140
Well that's not very important.

34

00:02:10.140  -->  00:02:14.730
You can execute that if you don't want the package started messages but that's OK.

35

00:02:15.060  -->  00:02:17.510
So I'm just going to enlarge this.

36

00:02:18.320  -->  00:02:18.710
OK.

37

00:02:18.720  -->  00:02:24.240
And now like for this course the approach will be taking to build this graph with digital too.

38

00:02:24.360  -->  00:02:30.450
It's going to be a step by step approach because we are first going to plot all the observation points

39

00:02:30.450  -->  00:02:31.830
in the turning set.

40

00:02:31.830  -->  00:02:37.530
Then we were going to plot the regression line and then we're going to add a title and then a label

41

00:02:37.530  -->  00:02:39.830
to the x axis and labels the y axis.

42

00:02:39.840  -->  00:02:41.630
So you know it's going to be step by step.

43

00:02:41.700  -->  00:02:46.950
First the observation points then the regression line then the title then the labels.

44

00:02:47.130  -->  00:02:49.940
OK so let's start with the observation point.

45

00:02:50.250  -->  00:02:54.030
So OK so generally you introduce a plot in DZIEDZIC plot.

46

00:02:54.090  -->  00:02:58.300
We started by typing GG plucked parenthesis.

47

00:02:58.370  -->  00:02:58.990
All right.

48

00:02:59.160  -->  00:03:01.500
And then that's when we start to build it step by step.

49

00:03:01.560  -->  00:03:03.360
The little components of our graph.

50

00:03:03.450  -->  00:03:08.530
And since we're adding each component one by one we are going to separate each of these components by

51

00:03:08.540  -->  00:03:09.250
plus.

52

00:03:09.480  -->  00:03:14.120
So let's go for the first component plus here I will press enter.

53

00:03:14.310  -->  00:03:16.770
And here we go for the first component.

54

00:03:16.770  -->  00:03:19.420
So the first component are the observation points.

55

00:03:19.560  -->  00:03:26.600
So very intuitively we are going to rise GM on that score point.

56

00:03:26.610  -->  00:03:27.540
All right.

57

00:03:27.540  -->  00:03:34.650
So we are going to use this function of Juji plot to scatterplot all our observation points of the trainset

58

00:03:34.680  -->  00:03:35.230
.

59

00:03:35.250  -->  00:03:41.820
So the first thing that we need to do is to precise which are going to be the x axis and the y axis

60

00:03:41.880  -->  00:03:47.410
and that's in the static function which we call a s.

61

00:03:47.430  -->  00:03:53.190
So that's the function that will take as input the X variables and the y variables so the X variables

62

00:03:53.190  -->  00:03:56.560
are your experience variable that means the number of years of experience.

63

00:03:56.640  -->  00:04:01.050
That's what we want to have in the x axis and the Y variable will be our salaries.

64

00:04:01.110  -->  00:04:03.660
But the real ones not the predicted ones yet.

65

00:04:04.050  -->  00:04:11.640
So therefore we are going to add in parenthesis X equals and then we're going to put all our years of

66

00:04:11.640  -->  00:04:14.050
experience but be careful.

67

00:04:14.070  -->  00:04:17.900
We want to take the years of experience of the observations in a training set.

68

00:04:18.000  -->  00:04:22.780
So we'll just have to specify trainset dollar.

69

00:04:23.040  -->  00:04:24.870
And then two years experience.

70

00:04:24.900  -->  00:04:31.140
So that means that we are taking the years experience values of the observations in the training set

71

00:04:31.160  -->  00:04:31.490
.

72

00:04:31.800  -->  00:04:32.470
OK.

73

00:04:32.760  -->  00:04:35.290
And now same for why.

74

00:04:35.670  -->  00:04:41.930
And here we do the same only with the salaries which is here.

75

00:04:42.360  -->  00:04:43.060
OK.

76

00:04:43.350  -->  00:04:46.290
And that plot all your observation points.

77

00:04:46.470  -->  00:04:48.970
The real ones in the plot.

78

00:04:49.470  -->  00:04:54.990
OK so we could stop here but we would like to recall that because we will want to make the distinction

79

00:04:54.990  -->  00:05:03.210
between the observation points and the regression line to make a nice plot so common here and then I'm

80

00:05:03.210  -->  00:05:08.650
going to press enter to add new arguments of Geum point because this can be a little confusing.

81

00:05:08.680  -->  00:05:13.170
We have we have a coming here and coming here this coming here is just to separate the eggs and the

82

00:05:13.170  -->  00:05:14.970
white in the static function.

83

00:05:14.970  -->  00:05:19.830
And this coming here is to separate the first argument and the second argument of the GM point function

84

00:05:19.850  -->  00:05:20.090
.

85

00:05:20.310  -->  00:05:28.080
So the second argument is color and let spec read I usually like to have my observation points and read

86

00:05:28.090  -->  00:05:28.200
.

87

00:05:28.350  -->  00:05:30.300
But you know that's just my taste.

88

00:05:30.300  -->  00:05:35.550
If you have some other tastes you're welcome to choose your favorite color for the observation point

89

00:05:35.560  -->  00:05:36.180
.

90

00:05:36.780  -->  00:05:41.420
OK so that's it for the GM point with this geom point part here.

91

00:05:41.490  -->  00:05:44.950
We are applauding all the observation points of our training set.

92

00:05:45.150  -->  00:05:49.830
And now let's add the following component which is our regression line.

93

00:05:49.830  -->  00:05:53.230
So here we add a little plus and then enter.

94

00:05:53.640  -->  00:06:00.510
So to plot the observation points we used geom point and now very intuitively to plot the regression

95

00:06:00.510  -->  00:06:01.040
line.

96

00:06:01.060  -->  00:06:03.850
We're going to use Giang line.

97

00:06:04.100  -->  00:06:09.840
All right so pretty easy to remember and then this line same as for the point we are going to take the

98

00:06:09.840  -->  00:06:13.770
x coordinates and the y coordinates of our regression line.

99

00:06:14.070  -->  00:06:17.280
So let's see first we need to take the function a static.

100

00:06:17.430  -->  00:06:19.320
Yes parenthesis.

101

00:06:19.530  -->  00:06:21.630
And that's where we put the X and Y.

102

00:06:21.960  -->  00:06:24.680
So in your opinion what is going to be the X.

103

00:06:24.990  -->  00:06:31.530
Well the X is going to be the years experience of the trining set because we want to have the predictions

104

00:06:31.980  -->  00:06:36.210
of the salaries for the observations in the training set.

105

00:06:36.210  -->  00:06:42.220
So in the x axis we need to have the number of years of experience of the trainset observations.

106

00:06:42.240  -->  00:06:50.610
So here I'm just going to copy this there and paste it here.

107

00:06:50.970  -->  00:06:58.140
But now what is going to be the why it's not going to be training said salary obviously because we don't

108

00:06:58.140  -->  00:06:59.640
want to take the real salaries.

109

00:06:59.640  -->  00:07:02.280
Now we want to take the predicted salaries.

110

00:07:02.280  -->  00:07:08.520
So in order to take a predicted salaries we will very simply use again this predict function.

111

00:07:08.520  -->  00:07:14.610
We cannot use again why read here because why predicts the predicted salaries of the test said observations

112

00:07:14.630  -->  00:07:15.110
.

113

00:07:15.120  -->  00:07:18.750
But we want to get the training set predicted salaries.

114

00:07:18.750  -->  00:07:29.310
So we will copy this predict today the predictions of the training said salaries and therefore in your

115

00:07:29.310  -->  00:07:34.910
data here we need to replace test set by training set.

116

00:07:35.670  -->  00:07:36.930
And now it's good.

117

00:07:36.960  -->  00:07:44.210
Now this GM line function here will plot all the predicted salaries of the training set observations

118

00:07:44.820  -->  00:07:48.870
and so for each employee with the same number of years of experience.

119

00:07:48.870  -->  00:07:50.690
Because here we have the same x.

120

00:07:50.920  -->  00:07:57.300
We're going to have both the real salaries the salaries they actually have in the company and the salaries

121

00:07:57.360  -->  00:08:01.840
predicted by our simple in our regression model for the same employees.

122

00:08:02.130  -->  00:08:04.190
OK so it's ready the line is ready.

123

00:08:04.200  -->  00:08:09.150
But as for the observation point we will just add a color and then that means that we need to put a

124

00:08:09.150  -->  00:08:11.830
comma here and press enter.

125

00:08:12.060  -->  00:08:15.000
And that's where we put the second argument which is going to be the caller.

126

00:08:15.360  -->  00:08:19.600
And this time we will pick a blue color.

127

00:08:19.920  -->  00:08:22.070
So again that's just my taste.

128

00:08:22.080  -->  00:08:24.800
You're welcome to use some other colors if you prefer.

129

00:08:25.200  -->  00:08:31.110
OK so now our plot is almost ready we have all the observation points of the trends that we have the

130

00:08:31.110  -->  00:08:32.640
regression line.

131

00:08:32.640  -->  00:08:34.230
And so now we could plot the graph now.

132

00:08:34.230  -->  00:08:39.990
But if you want to have a nice graph that we want to present to people like managers or clients or even

133

00:08:39.990  -->  00:08:45.130
your friends it's always better to add a little title and some labels on the access.

134

00:08:45.210  -->  00:08:48.540
So let's do this plus here and G.G..

135

00:08:48.570  -->  00:08:55.170
So this time Sangiovese G.G. because it's not a geometrical thing GG title parenthesis quotes because

136

00:08:55.380  -->  00:09:00.360
we have to put the title of our plot in quotes and here we're going to give the following title salary

137

00:09:01.850  -->  00:09:04.050
vs experience

138

00:09:06.840  -->  00:09:15.610
and we are going to specify that the trainset because then we will do the same for the test and close

139

00:09:15.630  -->  00:09:17.810
parenthesis and that's it.

140

00:09:18.360  -->  00:09:19.850
So perfect that's our title.

141

00:09:20.040  -->  00:09:27.270
And now let's just add a name of the x axis so to do this we use the x lab and in parenthesis we will

142

00:09:27.270  -->  00:09:34.240
say that the name of our x axis is going to be years of experience.

143

00:09:34.830  -->  00:09:35.710
OK.

144

00:09:36.060  -->  00:09:42.900
And then plus and then same for y axis and obviously it's going to be y lab and he will choose salary

145

00:09:43.770  -->  00:09:44.860
very simply.

146

00:09:45.360  -->  00:09:45.950
OK.

147

00:09:46.110  -->  00:09:48.800
And our graph is ready to be plotted.

148

00:09:49.050  -->  00:09:57.360
So I'm going to select all this and now press command control plus enter to execute.

149

00:09:57.540  -->  00:09:59.630
And here is our beautiful graph.

150

00:09:59.820  -->  00:10:06.750
So that's the trend that results with the real trainset observations with real salaries and red and

151

00:10:06.870  -->  00:10:08.390
regression line in blue.

152

00:10:08.550  -->  00:10:11.520
So let's zoom this graph and that's given interpretation.

153

00:10:12.970  -->  00:10:18.070
All right so this is our training set results so we can clearly make the distinction between the real

154

00:10:18.070  -->  00:10:20.560
observations which are the red points.

155

00:10:20.560  -->  00:10:24.280
So these are the real salaries of the employees in the company.

156

00:10:24.640  -->  00:10:29.690
And this blue straight line here is our linear regression model.

157

00:10:30.070  -->  00:10:36.340
So that's the prediction that means that for example if we take this employee here well we can see that

158

00:10:36.400  -->  00:10:42.550
his number of years of experience is a little more than five years of experience his real salary is

159

00:10:42.730  -->  00:10:52.120
about $65000 but our model predicted for this particular employee this result here.

160

00:10:52.120  -->  00:10:58.120
That means he predicted that this employee has a salary of a little less than seventy five thousand

161

00:10:58.120  -->  00:10:59.450
dollars.

162

00:10:59.470  -->  00:11:02.410
OK so that's a real important distinction to understand.

163

00:11:02.470  -->  00:11:07.330
This is the real value and this is the predicted value of the model and to get the predicted salary

164

00:11:07.330  -->  00:11:15.250
you need to project this point of the line here onto the salary access which give us predicted salary

165

00:11:15.250  -->  00:11:18.490
of a little less than $75000.

166

00:11:18.490  -->  00:11:18.940
All right.

167

00:11:18.940  -->  00:11:21.320
So that's the result of the training set.

168

00:11:21.430  -->  00:11:26.860
These are quite good results but that's because we trained our linear regression models on the training

169

00:11:26.860  -->  00:11:27.590
set.

170

00:11:27.730  -->  00:11:32.770
And now let's see how are simple in their regression all can predict new observations.

171

00:11:32.770  -->  00:11:35.570
That is your observations of the test set.

172

00:11:35.590  -->  00:11:37.390
So I'm going to close that.

173

00:11:37.550  -->  00:11:37.860
OK.

174

00:11:37.870  -->  00:11:43.180
Now let's do the same for the test sets to see if they are simple in their regression can make some

175

00:11:43.180  -->  00:11:45.520
good predictions on new observations.

176

00:11:45.520  -->  00:11:49.030
So the tests or observations on which our model wasn't built.

177

00:11:49.120  -->  00:11:51.970
So as usual we want to be efficient.

178

00:11:52.060  -->  00:11:59.560
And so we were going to copy all this copy and paste it here.

179

00:11:59.580  -->  00:12:00.530
OK.

180

00:12:00.550  -->  00:12:05.120
So let's replace all the trainset here by two sets.

181

00:12:05.370  -->  00:12:06.350
Ok.

182

00:12:06.850  -->  00:12:07.990
Here as well.

183

00:12:07.990  -->  00:12:09.680
Training set to set.

184

00:12:09.700  -->  00:12:11.270
That's the test results.

185

00:12:11.680  -->  00:12:11.910
OK.

186

00:12:11.920  -->  00:12:14.270
So now we must be careful with something.

187

00:12:14.290  -->  00:12:17.680
Let's see if we have to replace all the transects.

188

00:12:17.680  -->  00:12:24.160
So in the first component of Juji plot that is when we plot all the observation points to real observations

189

00:12:24.160  -->  00:12:24.600
.

190

00:12:24.940  -->  00:12:30.250
Here we have trainset years experience and training said salary in your opinion do we need to change

191

00:12:30.270  -->  00:12:32.070
strings here by test set.

192

00:12:32.380  -->  00:12:38.700
Yes of course because this time we want to have the observation points of the test set.

193

00:12:38.770  -->  00:12:44.380
So we want to take the years experience here of the tests their observations and the salaries of the

194

00:12:44.380  -->  00:12:45.900
test said observations.

195

00:12:45.910  -->  00:12:48.690
And here we will replace trainset by test.

196

00:12:49.120  -->  00:12:49.520
OK.

197

00:12:49.530  -->  00:12:54.790
But now in genome 9 so that is the component that builds the regression line.

198

00:12:54.790  -->  00:13:01.060
Do we need to replace training set by test set here no training set here in training set here.

199

00:13:01.210  -->  00:13:04.310
Do we need to replace those two training sets by test.

200

00:13:04.960  -->  00:13:10.690
Well the answer is actually of course no because our regressors already trained on the training set

201

00:13:10.690  -->  00:13:10.710
.

202

00:13:10.710  -->  00:13:16.900
So whether we keep the training set or replaced by test said we will obtain the same simple regression

203

00:13:16.900  -->  00:13:17.390
line.

204

00:13:17.560  -->  00:13:22.900
Indeed if we replaced your training set by test set we would just build some new points of the same

205

00:13:22.900  -->  00:13:26.700
regression line corresponding to the new predictions of the test and observation points.

206

00:13:26.710  -->  00:13:33.310
Because when we trained our symbology or regress her on the training set we obtained one unique model

207

00:13:33.310  -->  00:13:38.590
equation which is the simple in our equation itself and therefore with how we build the regression line

208

00:13:38.590  -->  00:13:44.050
here by predicting the training setpoints all the tests that points well since these predictions result

209

00:13:44.050  -->  00:13:49.040
from the same unique simple equation we will get the same regression line.

210

00:13:49.420  -->  00:13:50.040
OK.

211

00:13:50.060  -->  00:13:56.050
Now so that means that now we're ready to set to set test here and training said here we're all good

212

00:13:56.050  -->  00:13:56.150
.

213

00:13:56.200  -->  00:14:06.070
We are ready to plot the test results to find out how our simple regression behaves on new observations

214

00:14:06.070  -->  00:14:06.530
.

215

00:14:06.580  -->  00:14:10.740
So let's do this press command and control press enter to execute.

216

00:14:11.080  -->  00:14:12.120
And here we go.

217

00:14:12.280  -->  00:14:18.640
So as you can see as I was telling you if we go back to the training set here you can see that only

218

00:14:18.640  -->  00:14:23.300
the red points change you see and the blue regression line doesn't change.

219

00:14:23.300  -->  00:14:26.530
You see it's the same here only the red points change.

220

00:14:26.560  -->  00:14:30.790
So here that's the trainings that observation points with the model built in the training set.

221

00:14:30.970  -->  00:14:36.370
And here that's the test that observations with the same regression line builds on the training set

222

00:14:36.380  -->  00:14:36.640
.

223

00:14:36.910  -->  00:14:41.950
OK so now let's zoom on a test set plot and get some interpretation.

224

00:14:41.950  -->  00:14:44.380
OK so the test results are actually not bad.

225

00:14:44.380  -->  00:14:47.650
We can see that we have some very good predictions here.

226

00:14:47.860  -->  00:14:53.830
For example for this employee this employee this employee and this one as well because as you can see

227

00:14:53.830  -->  00:14:58.630
the real value is closer to the prediction which is on the blue regression line.

228

00:14:58.870  -->  00:15:04.990
So since these are new observations on which are simple in their regression model didn't learn any girl

229

00:15:04.990  -->  00:15:05.550
action.

230

00:15:05.740  -->  00:15:08.140
That's actually quite a good job to find.

231

00:15:08.140  -->  00:15:10.670
You know predictions so close to the real value.

232

00:15:10.810  -->  00:15:16.210
And of course there are some predictions that are further from the real value but that's because there

233

00:15:16.210  -->  00:15:22.530
is not 100 percent linear dependency between the salary and the years of experience.

234

00:15:22.780  -->  00:15:25.930
But for sure there is a certain linear dependence.

235

00:15:26.140  -->  00:15:30.940
All right so thank you for watching this tutorials about simple now regression in the next section we

236

00:15:30.940  -->  00:15:36.460
will find out about a new type of linear regression which is going to be the multiple in our regression

237

00:15:36.760  -->  00:15:42.880
meaning that instead of having only one independent variable we'll have several independent variables

238

00:15:43.270  -->  00:15:46.280
that will predict a single dependent variable.

239

00:15:46.330  -->  00:15:52.000
So there will be a new business problem and I can't wait to solve it with you using multiple regression

240

00:15:52.010  -->  00:15:52.260
.

241

00:15:52.510  -->  00:15:53.940
I'll see you in the next section.

242

00:15:53.950  -->  00:15:55.920
And until then enjoyer machine learning
