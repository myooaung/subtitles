00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:05,260
Hello and welcome to the course of machine learning.

2
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:06,680
This is curial Eremenko.

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:12,200
And I'd like to say that Hudlin and I are super excited to have inside this class and you're probably

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,730
wondering why is there a timer on your screen.

5
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:20,390
Well the reason is that we are so excited to have you on board that we want to get you excited and pumped

6
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:26,150
about learning machine learning and applying what you learn in your day to day life.

7
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:32,760
And that's why we're going to show you 10 examples of how machine learning is used in the real world.

8
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:37,810
So you can get super excited that you are learning these things at the moment in this class.

9
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:40,100
So we've got two minutes 20 seconds left.

10
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:47,330
It's a huge challenge I'm going to throw all of these examples at you very quickly to get you very excited

11
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:48,370
so let's get started.

12
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:53,850
All right machine learning applications number one Facebook facial recognition.

13
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:56,480
Everybody knows this when you upload a photo.

14
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:01,310
Facebook somehow knows already who your friends are and tags them automatically.

15
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,200
Well that's a machine learning algorithm in action.

16
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:06,460
There's a device or still is you can still buy.

17
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:11,490
It's called connected really didn't really lift off but that's like a marketing thing but it's a really

18
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:12,150
cool device.

19
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:18,900
It looks at your actions and you don't have to have a joystick and you can play games on your X-Box

20
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,870
and actually it uses a machine learning algorithm called random forest which will discuss in great detail

21
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:26,860
inside this class.

22
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:33,720
Then there's the virtual reality headsets where you turn your head and the picture moves and how does

23
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,630
the machine know how does headset know what to portray.

24
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:41,760
Well that's a machine learning algorithm monitoring your actions and connecting them to the game or

25
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:46,110
whatever you're looking at then on your phone so you have an iPhone.

26
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:52,140
You'll see this little button where you can do text to speech to text or voice recognition.

27
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:56,820
And when you click that button it recognizes what you're saying well that's a machine learning algorithm

28
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,900
in action again.

29
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:04,740
Then we've got robot dogs and they learn how to walk and it's very interesting how they teach them how

30
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:05,060
to walk.

31
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,080
They don't just put an algorithm in them.

32
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:15,540
Most of the time they actually use a good algorithm or a machine a learning method called reinforcement

33
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:18,680
learning so that dogs learn how to walk on their own.

34
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:21,490
Very interesting and one other thing that I will discuss inside the score.

35
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:23,500
So let's have a look how much time we have.

36
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:24,720
Forty seconds.

37
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,470
All right.

38
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,350
So Facebook ads they know you better than you know yourself.

39
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:29,180
Machine learning.

40
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,290
Amazon Netflix audible all use machine learning for their recommender systems.

41
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,940
Machine learning is used in medicine.

42
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:42,350
I personally know a data scientist who uses machine learning to save lives of people on a daily basis.

43
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:48,180
Machine learning is used in space to recognize certain areas of the world through maps and machine learning

44
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:52,700
is used to explore new territories such as Mars.

45
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,380
All right how are we going for time.

46
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,300
Still have eight seconds left.

47
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,500
Wonderful so hopefully that got you excited.

48
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:03,930
That's just ten examples of machine learning and how it's used in the real life.

49
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:08,280
And in this course we'll look at many different machine learning algorithms.

50
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:13,500
Those are used in these examples and those are that are used in other examples so hopefully you're going

51
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:18,520
to enjoy this class and find your own ways to apply machine learning in the real world.

52
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,210
And we always see on the next tutorial.

53
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,050
Until then intromission learning
