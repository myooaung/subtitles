00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:05,800
Let's demo some of the concepts that we just spoke about. In our demo, we're

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:11,010
going to look at the pom.xml file and add a dependency to it. We'll show you how

3
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:15,100
to add that dependency not used in our HelloWorld application currently, and

4
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:19,570
show you how to reference to transitive dependencies that are pulled in. Then

5
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:27,000
we'll also use scopes to show you how things don't get packaged or do get packaged in our final artifact.
