00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:04.310
This is what our workspace looks like the first time we've opened

2
00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:07.440
it up and haven't imported any projects into it.

3
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.150
Now, you'll see that there is an option to Import

4
00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:11.720
projects in the Package Explorer,

5
00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:16.340
and it's stating to us that there are no projects currently in our workspace.

6
00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.580
I'm not going to choose that one because that is only available

7
00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.780
the very first time that you use this workspace.

8
00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:31.440
Rather, I'm going to go up to File, and choose Import, and you'll see Maven.

9
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.740
We can expand that, and we'll say Existing Maven Project.

10
00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:38.440
Choose that, and we'll click Next.

11
00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.450
It's going to scan our workspace for a minute and see

12
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.700
which projects we have available for us,

13
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.640
and we'll click Browse.

14
00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.470
And you can see the HelloWorld project that we've

15
00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.140
been using throughout this course.

16
00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:58.130
Let's select that folder, and you'll see that it now has identified our POM.

17
00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:03.740
So we just chose the folder, and it found the POM underneath that folder.

18
00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:07.910
Let's click Finish, and now you'll see that in the lower right‑hand section,

19
00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:10.540
it's building our project this first time.

20
00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.700
So it will show you the success as it goes through and adds those dependencies,

21
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.640
configures our classpath, those types of things.

22
00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:19.760
Now that that's done,

23
00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.980
we can go over here and expand our project and you'll see

24
00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.220
that we have our src/main/java file,

25
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.880
and it will tell you that this is a src folder.

26
00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.500
And below that is our default package,

27
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.130
and you'll see our HelloWorld Java file that's

28
00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.240
actually residing underneath there.

29
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.090
The other interesting thing is our Maven Dependencies folder.

30
00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.440
Now we have interacted a little bit with the IDE throughout this,

31
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.840
but it wasn't required for you to have that IDE installed.

32
00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.560
So to show you how this ties in, we can open up our POM file,

33
00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:56.870
and once it goes through and scans our POM file and builds the cache of all

34
00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.740
the dependencies and everything else we have inside there,

35
00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.520
we can start to look at our dependencies.

36
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.450
We have org.apache.commons, lang3.

37
00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.580
We have the jupiter, junit libraries inside of here.

38
00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:11.960
We have hibernate‑core.

39
00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.480
So we can go over here and expand our Maven Dependencies,

40
00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.000
and you can see that it has all of those JARs,

41
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:24.000
plus the transitive dependencies associated with that. Let's look at how those got pulled in.
