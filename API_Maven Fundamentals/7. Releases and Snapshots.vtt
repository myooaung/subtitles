00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.350
Releases and snapshots can come from the same

2
00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:05.740
repository as we had previously mentioned.

3
00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:10.640
Why would we not want projects to just upload everything to the central repo?

4
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.930
Well,

5
00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:14.180
there's a release process not unlike deploying a mobile app to

6
00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.630
an app store, or something similar to that.

7
00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:18.340
It's a little bit difficult.

8
00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.510
We also want to make sure that we have everything final before

9
00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.510
we pushed it up there. Things like snapshots,

10
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:25.610
milestones,

11
00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:29.410
release candidates, all of these are best not to deploy to the central

12
00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.460
repository just because it's a little bit more work and a little bit of a

13
00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.370
headache to do so. We'll often define a repository to handle just snapshots

14
00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.340
and host it off of our own corporate website.

15
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.720
This was the case with the dependency repo that we

16
00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.740
looked at earlier from Spring.

17
00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:51.040
They don't want to put all of their snapshots up in repo.maven.apache.org.

18
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.550
And here's that repository again where we just get snapshots from the

19
00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:01.000
corporate repository of Spring. Snapshots are enabled, but releases are Disabled
