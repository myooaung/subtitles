00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:04.740
The target directory is where everything gets compiled to.

2
00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.000
It's also where all of your tests get ran from.

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.360
So when you run a go like package,

4
00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:15.800
it's also where we bundle up all of our code and our tests and run them from

5
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.450
the same structure, so it's contents from which your directory get packaged

6
00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:26.920
into a jar and war. To create this image on the left, I went ahead on our Hello

7
00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.780
World application and ran a maven package,

8
00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:32.740
and this is what gets dumped out.

9
00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.560
Now you can see that we have our classes directory,

10
00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.770
just our standard source main Java,

11
00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.660
the maven‑archiver directory, and that's what we're referring to for

12
00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.460
our packages, and then a Surefire and test classes directory, and

13
00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.040
that's how our code gets unit tested.

14
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.610
You can also see that the artifact that gets dumped out

15
00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.540
there is the HelloWorld‑1.0‑SNAPSHOT.

16
00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:03.000
Let's now look at how this ties into your POM file and syncs all these directories together.
