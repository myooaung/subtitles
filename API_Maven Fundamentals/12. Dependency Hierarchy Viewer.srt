00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:04,920
The Dependency Hierarchy view, I think, is one of the most important,

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,290
if not the most beneficial view inside of our IDE. It will

3
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:14,240
display the complete dependency tree, including transited dependencies,

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,020
as well as overridden and any conflicted dependencies

5
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:20,320
that we have inside of our application.

6
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,840
The scope of our resource is also displayed.

7
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,760
The Dependency view in this example is very, very clean.

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,370
There's nothing major going on,

9
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:39,000
but if we add a dependency like Hibernate has a lot of transitive dependencies, you'll definitely see the benefit of using this view.
