00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.120
This module is a basic introduction to Maven and what Maven is.

2
00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:08.180
We're going to go through and do a high‑level overview of Maven and

3
00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:11.840
just look at it from a 50,000 foot view, discuss a little bit about

4
00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:13.940
why you'd want to use it.

5
00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.250
Then we'll dive a little deeper if you've used Ant before or

6
00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.610
you're currently doing builds out of your IDE.

7
00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:23.380
We'll discuss why you want to use Maven over Ant and over your

8
00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.470
IDE, what the pros and cons of each are,

9
00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.260
and we'll go into a little bit more in‑depth look of

10
00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.840
just the cons of Ant versus Maven.

11
00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:33.110
Next,

12
00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.770
we'll look at the installation best practices and basically how a

13
00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.730
standard installation of Maven should work,

14
00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.600
what you need to set up on your machine, and where you download it from, those

15
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.140
types of things, and then we'll look at some sample code.

16
00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.000
We'll do a sample Hello World application that we can get

17
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.210
the most basic thing up and running and show you how it

18
00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:54.950
affects your job application.

19
00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.440
And then we'll explore the POM a little bit.

20
00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:58.560
Not in deep detail, though,

21
00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.140
because we're going to cover that in its own separate module. Then we'll

22
00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.670
follow all of these up with a brief summary about what we've covered and

23
00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.000
what you should've learned in this module. Let's look at that high‑level overview now.
