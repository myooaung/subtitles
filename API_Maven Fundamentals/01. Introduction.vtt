00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:02.000
In this module,

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.940
we will cover Eclipse, or rather Spring STS Integration with Maven.

3
00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:12.840
All modern IDEs have Maven integration and can be configured using <aven.

4
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.140
We're going to cover installing Spring STS,

5
00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:17.630
which is actually just a flavor of Eclipse with some

6
00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.940
plugins and some nice things added into it.

7
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.480
Then we're going to look at converting an existing project over

8
00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.540
to Maven to use Maven to configure the IDE.

9
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:31.440
We're going to look at importing projects that are also using Maven.

10
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.360
Then we will look at the various features,

11
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.840
including the POM Viewer and the Dependency Overview tool.

12
00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.610
Next we'll look at how we can add a dependency in our IDE,

13
00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.960
and it makes things a little bit easier,

14
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.120
as well as the dependency hierarchy, and how dependencies are resolved,

15
00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.050
including transitive dependencies.

16
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:49.660
Lastly,

17
00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:55.000
we'll look at the Effective POM, and what is your Effective POM inside your application?
