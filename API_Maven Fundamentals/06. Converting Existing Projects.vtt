00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:05.640
Converting existing projects is just as easy as importing new Maven projects.

2
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.820
If you have a POM file in your application,

3
00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:11.240
you can convert any Java project to a Maven project.

4
00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.860
If you don't have a POM file, it's really pretty easy to create one quite fast.

5
00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.900
You can rightâ€‘click on your project containing your POM file and

6
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.790
go to configure and convert to Maven project,

7
00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:24.270
and it will give you a little fly out where you can specify that

8
00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.580
you want to convert it to a Maven project.

9
00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.520
Once your project has been converted,

10
00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.570
the class path will automatically be set, and it will build the

11
00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:34.440
project and let you know of any errors that it may encounter or

12
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.000
whether it built successfully or not. Let's try this out with a sample project I've created now.
