00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:05,040
Dependencies are actually more easily added in the IDE.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,540
In fact, this is one huge benefit to using your IDE.

3
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:13,340
The Dependencies tab will show us which dependencies we have installed

4
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:17,140
and allow us to manipulate those dependencies as well.

5
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:20,080
The Dependency Management section that's also on

6
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,160
this tab is a more advanced topic,

7
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,810
and it's only used if you're using a parent POM,

8
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:28,070
which is definitely an advanced topic and something

9
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:30,840
we're not going to cover in this course.

10
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,470
The Add screen has searching capability,

11
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:35,330
which we're going to cover in a demo now,

12
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,320
which really makes it a nice feature.

13
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,940
We can just go ahead and type in any portion of it,

14
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:48,000
and it will give us a dropâ€‘down to which we can choose which version we want and have that added to our project for us.
