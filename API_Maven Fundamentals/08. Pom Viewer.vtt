00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:05.160
The POM Viewer is the default view when you open the POM file.

2
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.340
It gives you a POM overview that shows you the

3
00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.270
highâ€‘level elements of your project.

4
00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:14.160
Honestly, not super useful in the sense of what you can change,

5
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.540
other than the name.

6
00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.000
Most people will go directly to the source code because any

7
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.620
changes made here are directly changing the source.

8
00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:24.050
The Overview screen is real, basic looking,

9
00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:25.840
and there's things that you can change in here,

10
00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.990
such as naming convention, and packaging type,

11
00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.000
and that, but like I said, most people just generally do that in the source code anyway.
