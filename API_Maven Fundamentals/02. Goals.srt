1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:02,450
So throughout this training,

2
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:06,880
when you've seen us run things like compile or clean or package,

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:10,320
those have been goals. Goals are actually just plugins

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,510
configured in the Maven install.

5
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:17,920
So you've seen us run things like clean, compile, test, package, the

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,520
various install and deploy commands. Those are all basic goals that

7
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:25,740
are defined find inside the Super POM.

8
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,350
The Super POM has these goals defined in it,

9
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:31,810
which are then added to your effective POM.

10
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:34,160
Now this doesn't make much sense to you right now.

11
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,080
Don't worry about it.

12
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,420
That's what we're actually going to cover in this module.

13
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:40,780
But basically, we can configure all of these plugins inside of

14
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:44,750
our own project POM to tune and tweak what we want them to do,

15
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:47,240
and it's fairly common to do so.

16
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,880
A good example of this is the clean plugin. The

17
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,270
clean plugin is a very basic plugin,

18
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:56,200
but maybe you'll only want it to run during certain phases,

19
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,940
or you want to have it always run.

20
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:01,950
Say you wanted to force it to run every time you compile.

21
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:06,280
You could change which phase it's tied to. Right here,

22
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:10,940
it's tied to the clean phase, but we could tie it to the initial phase.

23
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:13,230
So goals are always tied to a phase,

24
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:20,000
and you can see from this example that it is just set for the clean goal and clean phase.
