00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:05,540
Installation with Spring STS Suite and Eclipses very easy.

2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:09,220
It doesn't use the registry, so there's nothing really to install.

3
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:12,140
We just download and unzip a bundle,

4
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:17,040
and Java and Maven are installed the same way regardless of using the IDE.

5
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:20,930
So I have to have Java installed, my JAVA_HOME variable set,

6
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:24,610
and I have to have Maven installed. Some IDEs do

7
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:26,920
include a bundled version of Maven,

8
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:31,020
and you can download Spring STS with a bundled version of Maven.

9
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:35,910
I personally prefer to install it outside of it because it's where

10
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:38,090
it finds settings in that type of stuff from,

11
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:41,780
I don't want to have to configure it in multiple places. It can often be

12
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:56,000
confusing and lead to errors down the road. To download spring STS, we're just going to go to the URL spring.io/tools.
