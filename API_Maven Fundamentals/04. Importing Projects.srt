00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:04,750
Importing an existing Maven project is really quite easy.

2
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:09,940
Spring STS or Eclipse has a Maven integration built directly into it.

3
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:13,850
The integration will allow us to execute the default Maven goals within

4
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:19,270
our IDE. IDE configuration and the classpath will also be set from our

5
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:24,140
Maven POM file. To import a project, all we have to do is locate that

6
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:29,810
project on our disk, right‑click in the Package Explorer, import Maven

7
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:33,580
and existing Maven projects, and it will show a pop‑up similar to this

8
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:38,140
where we can say that we want to choose that existing Maven project.

9
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:40,230
This will go ahead and import all of our source

10
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:46,000
code and set our classpath for us. Let's go ahead and look at doing that right now.
