Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:10,940
My name is Bryan Hansen, and welcome to my course, Maven Fundamentals.

3
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:13,560
I'm the Director of Development at Software Technology

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,860
Group and a longâ€‘time Pluralsight author.

5
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:19,910
The original version of this course was the first course I ever produced for

6
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:23,830
Pluralsight, and it's still one of my favorite topics to teach.

7
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:25,130
It was time to update it, though,

8
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:28,130
to use more recent versions of Maven and also to take

9
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:30,890
advantage of newer versions of Java.

10
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:31,540
In this course,

11
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:33,790
we're going to learn about the changes introduced by

12
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:36,940
utilizing more recent versions of Java.

13
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:41,120
Some of the major topics that we will cover include Maven installation,

14
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,830
transitive dependencies, building using Java 11 or newer,

15
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:48,430
using Maven with existing code,

16
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:51,280
and other exciting changes that have occurred with

17
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,640
more recent versions of Maven.

18
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,790
By the end of this course,

19
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:57,930
you'll know how to use Maven in your day to day programming and what

20
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:01,440
changes were needed to use it with newer versions of Java.

21
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,080
Although not required,

22
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:26,000
some experience with Java is helpful prior to learning Maven. I hope you'll join me on this journey to learn about Maven Fundamentals.
