00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.300
Now that we've seen the basic defaults that Maven has to offer,

2
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:07.580
the next question people always ask when learning Maven is great,

3
00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.440
how do I override those defaults?

4
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:11.240
Inevitably,

5
00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.110
you have some legacy code or something stuck around that you

6
00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:18.330
have to conform Maven to build to that structure or get it to

7
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.940
produce an artifact of a certain name.

8
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.480
So how do you override those? The build section. As you may remember earlier,

9
00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.270
we mentioned that the build section is where we override things of a specific

10
00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.310
nature. I'm going to show a few examples from the build section, nothing super

11
00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:37.040
deep, but how to override some of those defaults.

12
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.360
Then we're going to go deeper on the build section in the Plugins module,

13
00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:48.000
which is a later module in this course. Let's go ahead and change the final artifact name of our application that gets built now
