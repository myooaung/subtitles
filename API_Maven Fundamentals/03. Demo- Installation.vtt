00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:03.240
Getting Spring STS is actually quite easy.

2
00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:12.140
I'm just going to go ahead and open up our browser and go to spring.io/tools,

3
00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:17.620
and it will open up the main web page for the tool suite.

4
00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:21.940
It will detect which version of operating system you're on.

5
00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:27.230
We'll go ahead and choose Windows 64‑bit and it will start downloading it.

6
00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.870
I've actually already got mine downloaded,

7
00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:33.970
so I'm going to cancel that and show you where I

8
00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.690
have it downloaded to my local OS.

9
00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.930
You can see I have Spring STS tool suite right here.

10
00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.060
And if you open it up, it's just a bundled .zip file.

11
00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:45.710
That's all it is.

12
00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:54.840
I like to expand mine alongside my C dev tools Maven installation that we have,

13
00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.570
and you can see inside of here I've got a folder for Java,

14
00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.020
a folder for Maven, and a folder now for my Spring STS tool suite.

15
00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.340
So I've just gone ahead and expanded that over to here.

16
00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:06.940
And if you open this up inside of here,

17
00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.680
there is the application launcher for SpringToolSuite4.

18
00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.160
So if I double‑click on this,

19
00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:18.040
it's going to open up and launch the installation for it.

20
00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.970
It'll also ask you if you want to choose a default workspace

21
00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.140
or which workspace you want to go to.

22
00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.570
To begin with, it's going to have a much longer path.

23
00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.590
I chose C:\dev\workspace, and if you want,

24
00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.210
you can choose to have it use this as the default

25
00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.040
workspace and to not ask for that again.

26
00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:44.030
I like to have my dev tools and workspace all configured in that same space.

27
00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.000
You can choose to put it where you like,

28
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.550
but I like having those combined together. And then click Launch,

29
00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:54.130
and it'll take it a second, it'll launch the tool suite and come

30
00:01:54.130 --> 00:02:01.000
up to the main default workspace, and all of your tools will be available there for you to use.
