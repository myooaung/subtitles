00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:05.890
To convert an existing Java project over to be a Maven project inside of Spring

2
00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:12.110
STS, it's actually quite easy. Before I dive into it though, I want you to look

3
00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:14.740
at the two icons associated with these projects.

4
00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.630
So I have this sample project Foo that I've created, that's

5
00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.880
just a basic Java project, and then I have our HelloWorld

6
00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.240
project that we imported previously.

7
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.160
Notice the icon in the upper‑left hand corner of

8
00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:32.950
HelloWorld has a little m next to it, signifying that it is a Maven project.

9
00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:35.940
The Java project does not have that yet.

10
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.670
Now to convert this, I have created a basic POM file inside of here,

11
00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.320
and I've added some simple information to it, our groupId,

12
00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.940
our artifactId, version, and then our packaging type.

13
00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.640
Now, our POM for our HelloWorld application has a lot more, but there's

14
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.370
nothing in our project Foo just yet. So to convert this,

15
00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:04.840
I want to right‑click on it, and go to Configure, and Convert to Maven Project.

16
00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.550
You're going to see that the progress bar down below goes through and downloads

17
00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.470
any dependencies that we need, and those types of things, and goes ahead and

18
00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.940
converts our project over to being a Maven project once it's done building

19
00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.100
everything. Now that this is done though,

20
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.440
there are a couple of things inside of here worth mentioning.

21
00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.970
It's now set the default as Java 1.5, which that's not

22
00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.020
even a supportive environment anymore.

23
00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.940
And we have a target directory and a BIN directory hanging

24
00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.040
out here as well, and our src directory.

25
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.830
So we probably ought to go ahead and do what we learned earlier

26
00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:49.210
with the build version, and open up our POM, and add a build

27
00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.440
section for the Compiler Plugin.

28
00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:58.930
So I'm going to go ahead and grab that build plugin plugin for the compiler.

29
00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.910
I want to go ahead and open up our other POM, and

30
00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:06.150
add that section in there as well.

31
00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:12.020
Now I do need to close off our plugins element, and close

32
00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.650
off our build element, and save that.

33
00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.240
And now we want to go up to our project, and right‑click

34
00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:29.040
on it, and say Maven, Update Project, click OK,

35
00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.200
and you can see that it bumped up our build version to Java SE11.

36
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:41.000
So now that we have that all compiling the way that we expect it to, it'll act a little bit better for us.
