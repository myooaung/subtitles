1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,570
The last plugin that we're going to look at configuring is the Javadoc Plugin,

2
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:08,810
and the Javadoc Plugin is almost identical to the Source Plugin in the sense

3
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:13,360
that we're going to take our javadocs and patch them into a JAR file when we

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:18,050
upload them to our repository. Just like the Source Plugin, you can browse the

5
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:21,670
Javadoc Plugins website to see any other additional information or goals that

6
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:24,840
are available there, but it's really pretty straightforward.

7
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,120
We typically tie it to our package phase,

8
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,800
but if we're running package a lot,

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,040
we can hinder performance, and so we'll tie it to a later phase like the

10
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:38,440
verify phase or how we did with the Source Plugin, the install.

11
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:42,390
Usually, we just use the defaults, but if you have

12
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:44,860
customized javadocs for your company,

13
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:48,380
maybe throw in your company logo or change colors or whatever.

14
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:54,360
You can customize all this inside the Javadoc Plugin configuration.

15
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,820
So this plugin is defined almost identical to the source plugin in the

16
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:01,040
sense that we have our group ID, artifact ID, and version,

17
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:06,000
and then we just tie it to an execution section. Let's see what that looks like now.
