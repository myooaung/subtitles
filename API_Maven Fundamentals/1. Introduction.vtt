00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:06.090
In this module, we're going to cover repositories. Repositories or short

2
00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:10.620
repos are what Maven looks at to download code and other artifacts from so

3
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.440
that we can use them inside of our application.

4
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.240
We're going to look at the difference between a dependency repo

5
00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.570
and a plugin repo, and we'll also see how to override those

6
00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.340
repos from their default location.

7
00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.040
Then we'll look at how you can tell Maven where it should

8
00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.640
look for releases versus snapshots.

9
00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:35.000
Projects don't always release snapshots at the same place that they'll release their final artifacts at.
