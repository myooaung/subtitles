00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,690
The JAR plugin is used to package our code into a JAR file,

2
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:08,840
and it's pretty straightforward as far as its configuration's concern.

3
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:11,350
Its output result is going to make a JAR,

4
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:16,040
and it's usually tied to the package phase of our build lifecycle.

5
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:19,520
Now the Configuration section will allow us to do a couple of things,

6
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,930
but nothing too extravagant here. We can change the includes and

7
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:27,390
excludes, so if you want to only package certain things inside your

8
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:30,940
JAR, like maybe you don't want generated source code in there or

9
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:36,240
you want to include XML files, you can specify what you want in that section.

10
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,420
It will also build our manifest for us.

11
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:43,570
An example of this is that I can define a plugin in the Configuration

12
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:47,900
section, tell it to use the default manifest that it can generate, so it

13
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:57,000
will take our build and make our manifest file for us and package up our application into a JAR automatically.
