1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:03,220
To demonstrate showing you repositories,

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:08,690
I want to begin by showing you Spring's repo for snapshots.

3
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:11,090
So we're going to start off by opening up a browser and

4
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:16,300
going to repo.spring.io/libs‑snapshot/.

5
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:24,800
This will pull up a repository, and you'll quickly see they're a basic website.

6
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,770
There's nothing really that exciting about it.

7
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:31,940
I'm going to navigate all the way down to org,

8
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:35,440
which is about halfway down this page here,

9
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:40,120
and we're going to use the groupId of our artifact to

10
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:45,170
navigate into our Spring core artifact.

11
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:48,770
So if we go to org, and then this will pull up another page,

12
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:49,600
and we'll go to the Spring Framework,

13
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,040
and I'm actually going to use these search on this page to find it quicker.

14
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:59,080
Now notice before I click on here that there are three springframeworks here,

15
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,070
and this is another thing I wanted to point out.

16
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:02,110
Notice the misspellings.

17
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:04,730
There's springframeWork with a capital W,

18
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:09,230
springFramework with a capital F, and then all lowercase springframework.

19
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:13,520
One of the bad things about artifacts, and it's a good thing and a bad thing,

20
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,540
is that once we've created them, they're really not supposed to be deleted.

21
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:21,020
And so these misspellings of springframeWork with a capital

22
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:23,840
W and springFramework with a capital F,

23
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,500
we should leave there for anything we build the future.

24
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:30,250
Now this is a snapshot repository, so we really probably don't care,

25
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:33,720
but that's why there are three renditions of that spelling.

26
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,200
Let's click on springframework.

27
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:41,340
Inside of here, we can scroll down and we'll find spring‑core.

28
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:44,410
If I click on spring‑core, and scroll down to the bottom,

29
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:50,040
you'll see 5.2.0.BUILD‑SNAPSHOT.

30
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,290
Now, when I click on this,

31
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:55,750
you're going to see something that you maybe weren't expecting. Inside of here,

32
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:59,840
there is not a file called BUILD‑SNAPSHOT.

33
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,640
This is where I said the meaning of snapshot has an

34
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,780
extra special something behind it.

35
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:10,690
Maven knows to go look for the latest timestamp or

36
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:12,970
increment inside that directory.

37
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:18,500
So when we give it a groupId of org/springframework and an artifactId

38
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:23,060
of spring‑core, and a version of whatever‑snapshot,

39
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,590
it goes and looks in that directory for the most

40
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:29,140
recent code there, every time we build.

41
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:31,860
So if you do this with other files,

42
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,420
if I back up a directory here and I go to one that's

43
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,890
not listed as a snapshot anymore,

44
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:43,840
the code inside of here will have specific build numbers on there.

45
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,950
So if I go inside of this RC1, well,

46
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:50,880
this RC1 doesn't handle the same way snapshots are handled,

47
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,610
and so inside of this directory,

48
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:56,720
we just have RC1; we don't have these timestamped files.

49
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,030
So you kind of get an idea of what that snapshot is doing.

50
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:05,240
Inside of there, it has a BUILD‑ year, month,

51
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:10,680
day, dot hour, minute, second, dash their build number.

52
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,940
So there's been 402 builds of 5.2.0,

53
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:19,140
and you get to see the timestamp that this was done on May 30th.

54
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:23,020
So this is how snapshots work inside of Maven.

55
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:26,220
Now, let's go demonstrate this inside of our project.

56
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:29,920
I'm going to go ahead and switch to our IDE,

57
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,620
and inside of our IDE, I want to add that dependency,

58
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:36,940
and I'm going to start off by saying dependency,

59
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:43,840
and give it a groupId of org.springframework,

60
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:52,940
and then an artifactId of spring‑core,

61
00:03:52,940 --> 00:04:01,310
and then our version is going to be 5.2.0.BUILD in all uppercase,

62
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:07,520
SNAPSHOT, and save this.

63
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,000
Now you'll notice, we immediately got a red error.

64
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,620
You can see on line 33, we've got a red X,

65
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,570
and the reason why is this is a snapshot,

66
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:17,640
and we haven't pulled in that repository.

67
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,730
So we're going to do two things here.

68
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:22,310
We're going to add a repository that goes ahead and

69
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:24,160
allows us to download snapshots,

70
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,070
because the main repo doesn't allow you to pull down snapshots.

71
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:32,900
Now to download that dependency, because you can see we have that red X again.

72
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,000
I need to add another repository,

73
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,980
and I'm going to go down between my dependency's closing element and

74
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:42,440
my opening build element and say repositories,

75
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:48,040
and inside of this element, I have to give it the singular repository element.

76
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,470
And in here I've got to give it an id, and for the id,

77
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:55,640
I'll just do spring‑snapshot, and really,

78
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,510
the id is important to you; it's not important to Maven,

79
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:00,440
going out and pulling that down.

80
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,280
The next thing we need to add is the URL,

81
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:06,360
and I've gone ahead and grabbed that URL from our browser,

82
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:11,600
and its http://repo.spring.io/libs‑snapshot.

83
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:20,910
And before we close this out, I want to restrict this just to snapshots.

84
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:27,030
So I'm going to say snapshots enabled, and for sake of screen real estate,

85
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:30,540
I'm going to do this on the same line,

86
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:35,540
and then I'm going to create a new line that says releases,

87
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:38,010
enabled, and false.

88
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:41,940
So this going to to restrict this to just snapshots.

89
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:44,360
Now, I want to point out before I save this,

90
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:48,450
it's going to automatically download that and adjust my project

91
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:50,880
and will get rid of that red X on line 33.

92
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,240
So I'm going to hit Ctrl+S and save it, and it's already building my application.

93
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,140
You'll notice the red X went away.

94
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,850
Okay, did it actually download it, though?

95
00:05:58,850 --> 00:05:59,050
Well,

96
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:03,140
we can go check that by going up to our Maven dependencies,

97
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:05,630
opening it up, and if we scroll down,

98
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:11,940
you'll see spring‑core 5.2.0.BUILD‑SNAPSHOT.jar, and you'll

99
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:16,040
notice its path is pointing to our hard drive.

100
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,660
You see the path exactly to where that file is stored.

101
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,080
So if you wanted to go out there and verify it,

102
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,810
you can actually navigate to that in your File Explorer, and see

103
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:28,140
that it did in fact exist at that location.

104
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,260
So pretty simple.

105
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:33,050
We showed you that HTTP sites for repositories are just that.

106
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:37,590
They're very simple websites that a dependency with a snapshot

107
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:40,530
will not build, because most people don't upload their

108
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:43,970
snapshots to the central Maven repo.

109
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,550
And to add a repository,

110
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:50,170
we can go ahead and just add a repositories element below our closing

111
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:55,380
dependencies tag, but before our build tag, and add a single repository

112
00:06:55,380 --> 00:07:00,440
for snapshots and restrict it to just a snapshot release and no other

113
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:05,040
final releases from that repository. Really simple to do, but a good way

114
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:11,000
for you go download code that's possibly under development by a library that you're using.
