00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.210
The Effective POM can be a very wordy document.

2
00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:07.730
It is actually what our POM is underneath the hood of everything.

3
00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:12.760
It's our complete POM with everything that's inherited from our project POM.

4
00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:18.180
If we're using a parent POM and the default super POM, so it's three,

5
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.710
possibly even four POM files combined into one.

6
00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.420
It's more of a debugging tool to see what the POM is doing

7
00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.940
and what versions of things we're using.

8
00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.230
Not a lot of people spend much time in here,

9
00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.430
but it is important to know about because you can find specific

10
00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.240
things inside your application in the Effective POM.

11
00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.690
We'll show a demo of it,

12
00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.400
and I'll scroll through the whole Effective POM, and you'll see

13
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.870
that it's quite wordy and lengthy, but it is important to know

14
00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.280
what's going on inside of there,

15
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:52.000
and that is an available tool to help you troubleshoot things inside of your application.
