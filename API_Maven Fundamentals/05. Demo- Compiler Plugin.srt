1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:03,360
Since this is an updated course,

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:08,580
we actually had to jump ahead and add the plugin for the Maven Compiler

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:12,740
early on in the course to use a newer version of Java.

4
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:16,070
This was required after about Java 8.

5
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:19,850
It doesn't really matter though if you want to specify the version of Java.

6
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:20,390
Like I said,

7
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:25,010
this is the most overridden plugin there is inside of a Maven project.

8
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:27,900
You're going to define this anyway, so we jumped ahead a little bit.

9
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,440
But now that you understand how plugins work and that we have a build section,

10
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,240
let's just review it quickly.

11
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,910
So inside of our build section, again,

12
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:38,160
we have a plugins section because we can have multiple plugins,

13
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,510
and then we have defined the maven‑compiler‑plugin inside of here.

14
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:47,280
It has the groupId of org.apache.maven.plugins and the

15
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,140
artifactId of maven‑compiler‑plugin.

16
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:57,520
The version is 3.8.0 and the configuration and, specifically,

17
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,110
the release is version 11 inside of here.

18
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:04,940
Now I want to show you one small change inside of here

19
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:07,330
just for the sake of an example.

20
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:12,140
If we wanted to compile this down to Java 9,

21
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:14,640
and we save this,

22
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,040
it'll go through and it will build our project, but it'll give

23
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:23,940
us a warning or an error stating that the project space isn't

24
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:26,390
up to date with the configuration.

25
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:31,010
And you can tell that by our project name having a red X in it,

26
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:38,200
or if we looked at the Problems section in our application down below here,

27
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:42,250
the project configuration is not up to date with the pom.xml.

28
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:46,440
Now, how we resolve that is we go right‑click on our project,

29
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:51,540
go down to Maven, and Update Project.

30
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:52,810
Click OK.

31
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:56,210
And it should go through, rebuild our application,

32
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:58,990
and you'll notice that it has now configured our

33
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:04,340
project to be a JavaSE‑9 application.

34
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:06,340
Well, we know we want to go with the later version,

35
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:08,790
so we're going to switch it back to 11.

36
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:12,390
And at the time of recording, Java 12 has been released,

37
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:16,920
but the plugin isn't working as nicely with the IDE.

38
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:20,440
So when things are a little bit more flushed out,

39
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:26,780
you'll be able to change this to 12 and it will embrace the Java 12 JRE.

40
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,730
So let's switch this back to 11.

41
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:31,230
Save it, right‑click on our project again,

42
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:46,000
say Maven, Update Project, click OK, it'll do the same thing. It'll go refresh, build your application, and then bump it up to JavaSE‑11.
