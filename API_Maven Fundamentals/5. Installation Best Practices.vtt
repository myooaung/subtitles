00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:05.540
Let's look at how we install Maven and the setup and configuration

2
00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.340
of it just to get our environment up and running.

3
00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.730
To get a copy of it, we just need to navigate to maven.apache.org,

4
00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:16.650
and you can see we have a Download link in the left‑hand section,

5
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.120
or there's one right in the center of our page.

6
00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.410
They go to the same place.

7
00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:21.670
I'm going to click on that.

8
00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.740
If you ever have a problem getting Maven,

9
00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.940
you may want to check to make sure you don't have a mirror that is blocked.

10
00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:33.530
So some companies will block FTP sites. This is a common problem that I see

11
00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.540
while people are trying to get various applications downloaded.

12
00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.230
They'll go to an FTP site or a mirror that's blocked for whatever reason,

13
00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.750
and it will just error out, and they don't know why.

14
00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.710
So if you're having a problem downloading it, try one of the different mirrors.

15
00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:49.250
This one should work for us.

16
00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.240
I'm going to scroll down on the page a little bit,

17
00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.390
and you can see that we have a tar file,

18
00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.640
a binary zip archive, and the source code.

19
00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.910
A lot of times you don't really need to download the source code.

20
00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.230
In fact, I would dare say, rarely do you need to download the source code,

21
00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:09.810
and tarballs are usually for Linux or UNIX‑based environments,

22
00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.060
where ZIPs are more for Windows environments.

23
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.160
I'm going to go ahead and download the binary zip archive.

24
00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.040
You can see it downloading down below.

25
00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.410
I've actually already got it done on my box,

26
00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:23.540
so I'm just going to minimize this and let it finish.

27
00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.730
Now I want to open up File Explorer, and I like to create a folder

28
00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:34.640
structure of C:\dev\tools and then expand my JDK there,

29
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.780
my IDE, Maven. Any other tools like that I have,

30
00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.340
I like to put underneath this directory.

31
00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.640
So I want to go ahead and grab that ZIP file that I've already

32
00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:51.000
downloaded and just copy the contents over there.

33
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.420
Now, as it expands that,

34
00:01:53.420 --> 00:02:00.290
two things. You'll notice that the ZIP file actually comes over as a

35
00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.750
folder named the exact same thing inside the ZIP file.

36
00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.170
So when you click on this, it should go directly into a bin,

37
00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.280
boot, conf, lib directory.

38
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.440
So from our tools directory, you'll see that apache‑maven.

39
00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:15.480
From time to time,

40
00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.150
I'll see people who have a nested Apache folder underneath there,

41
00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.030
depending on how they've expanded that.

42
00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.290
So it'll be apache‑maven‑3.6.1 and a folder inside

43
00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.320
that called apache‑maven‑3.6.1, and then it will go into that bin,

44
00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.530
conf, lib directory.

45
00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.810
So just make sure your structure looks the same,

46
00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.680
that it goes into dev, tools, apache‑maven‑3.6.1,

47
00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.620
and then you've got your bin directory there.

48
00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.250
And I keep referencing the bin file because that's what we're

49
00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.910
going to now point our environment variables to.

50
00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.340
Let's go ahead and minimize these folders.

51
00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.420
Let's go ahead and edit our system environment variables.

52
00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.300
Now notice I say system environment variables.

53
00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.110
If you click on the user environment variables,

54
00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.640
it's not going to let you edit those.

55
00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.640
So let's open up this account and say Environment Variables.

56
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.680
And if these are grayed out down here, the New,

57
00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.540
Edit, and Delete buttons, it's because you've chosen to edit the user variables.

58
00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:20.660
Let's go ahead and click New, and for the Variable name, we will say JAVA_HOME.

59
00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.820
I already installed Java on this OS,

60
00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.630
but I have not set up the environment variables.

61
00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.180
And if you don't have this set up correctly,

62
00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.190
you will get an error when you try to run Maven.

63
00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:38.540
I'm going to click Browse Directory, and I'm going to go to This PC,

64
00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.840
and I have all of my stuff under C:, dev,

65
00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:48.330
tools, and I'll click my jdk for the first one and click OK.

66
00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:55.090
So that should say C:\dev\tools\jdk, yours may not be exactly, ‑12.0.1,

67
00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.940
do it to the directory that you installed yours to,

68
00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:59.500
and click OK.

69
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.760
And then we want to do one more environment variable.

70
00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:10.040
We'll say New, MAVEN_HOME, and we'll Browse Directory again.

71
00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:15.540
We'll do the same thing. We'll go to C:,

72
00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:24.040
dev, tools, and we have our apache‑maven‑3.6.1 instance there.

73
00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.760
Click OK and OK again.

74
00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.340
We're almost done; we need to edit the Path.

75
00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:35.550
So if we come over here and say Edit Path, this brings up a different dialog.

76
00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.980
If you've used other versions of Windows in the past,

77
00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:39.850
it didn't look the same as this.

78
00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:43.400
We have to do two things here. Want to click New,

79
00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:52.340
and we want to type in %JAVA_HOME%\bin.

80
00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.340
And we want to move that up to the very top.

81
00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:04.840
And then we want to do another New, want to do %MAVEN_HOME%\bin,

82
00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.140
and move that up to the second position,

83
00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.510
just below JAVA_HOME.

84
00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:12.390
Yours should look similar to that, %JAVA_HOME%\bin,

85
00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:19.240
%MAVEN_HOME%\bin, and click OK, click OK,

86
00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.640
and then click OK again.

87
00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:26.040
And now we should be able to run a Command Prompt.

88
00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:32.640
And from here I can type java, and I should get different commands for Java.

89
00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:37.170
I should be able to type mvn and get different options for Maven.

90
00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:38.590
The first time you run this,

91
00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:41.670
it's going to give you an error because it can't find a build file.

92
00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:48.000
That's actually correct; we don't have a project set up yet. That's what we're going to do next.
