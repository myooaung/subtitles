1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:05,460
Our src/main/java directory is where we store all of our Java code.

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:09,040
It's also the beginning of our package declaration.

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,890
If you've done much with Java, or C# as well,

4
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:16,540
you'll know that we have a package declaration at the top of our application.

5
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:19,870
This is the start of our source code directory.

6
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:21,140
In our previous example,

7
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:24,720
we were just using the default package, so it stores it right underneath

8
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:30,470
src/main/java. But, if we use a package, which you ultimately should, it would

9
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:34,140
build that folder structure underneath this directory.

10
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:35,540
What about other languages?

11
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:40,640
Say we're using Groovy or Scala or Kotlin, or another tool like that,

12
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,020
or that we're generating some web services? We can actually set it up

13
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:49,670
to use the src/main/groovy or src/main/resources folder, or other

14
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:53,540
folder structures underneath that. When we talk more about plugins in

15
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:54,540
a later module,

16
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:57,900
you'll learn that this is how we keep that code separate or how

17
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:01,290
we use those different plugins to access the different types of

18
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:03,540
source code that we're dealing with.

19
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:05,040
What about testing?

20
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,140
You actually set up a src/test/java directory.

21
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:10,830
You want to do this for two reasons.

22
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:14,040
You can keep test code separate from production code,

23
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,440
but we can have them reference the same package structure.

24
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:21,200
We'll show an example of how this is done down the road, but suffice

25
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,810
it to say, you put all of your test code under src/test/java and all

26
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:27,640
of your source code under src/main/java.

27
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:31,440
One thing that's worth mentioning is that src/test/java directory is

28
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:35,330
specifically for unit tests and not necessarily for things like

29
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:39,140
integration tests or other types of testing, black box,

30
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:46,000
white box, etc. It's an automated test, but specifically just for unit tests.
