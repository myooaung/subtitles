1
00:00:00,347 --> 00:00:04,357
Just like for operations and projects, there's grooming for initiatives.

2
00:00:04,357 --> 00:00:07,317
Let's explore.

3
00:00:07,317 --> 00:00:09,364
How do you select the right initiatives to be in

4
00:00:09,364 --> 00:00:11,317
your backlog in the first place?

5
00:00:11,317 --> 00:00:13,367
Well, that is the million-dollar question for sure.

6
00:00:13,367 --> 00:00:17,347
This is the hard part, even before the real grooming even begins.

7
00:00:17,347 --> 00:00:20,297
At the operations or basic project level,

8
00:00:20,297 --> 00:00:23,461
those are pretty basic things to do and people are typically

9
00:00:23,461 --> 00:00:26,297
coming to you with the projects they would like.

10
00:00:26,297 --> 00:00:27,307
At this level,

11
00:00:27,307 --> 00:00:29,626
the business is presenting high-level initiatives and

12
00:00:29,626 --> 00:00:32,317
strategies and maybe leaving the rest up to you.

13
00:00:32,317 --> 00:00:38,377
This is a big challenge and selecting the right team members is the first step.

14
00:00:38,377 --> 00:00:39,377
Building Your Team.

15
00:00:39,377 --> 00:00:41,307
You cannot do this alone.

16
00:00:41,307 --> 00:00:44,317
You need a team to help you determine your initial projects,

17
00:00:44,317 --> 00:00:45,337
and as I keep mentioning,

18
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:49,307
how better to ensure the initiatives and projects are aligned to the business,

19
00:00:49,307 --> 00:00:53,377
thereby including business leaders and Subject-Matter Experts into your process.

20
00:00:53,377 --> 00:00:55,307
So with the Board of Directors,

21
00:00:55,307 --> 00:00:58,367
I would suggest limited interviews to get their vision and recommendations.

22
00:00:58,367 --> 00:01:00,387
They're probably really busy, hard to reach,

23
00:01:00,387 --> 00:01:02,387
and you got to be careful with their time.

24
00:01:02,387 --> 00:01:04,367
Next, with senior executives,

25
00:01:04,367 --> 00:01:08,307
I would have regular interviews to get their vision and recommendations,

26
00:01:08,307 --> 00:01:11,337
and maybe one or two from this group could actually be on your team.

27
00:01:11,337 --> 00:01:14,307
Next, line of business or LOB leaders.

28
00:01:14,307 --> 00:01:18,176
I really have regular and consistent interviews with them and I would

29
00:01:18,176 --> 00:01:21,357
suggest that many of this group actually be on your team.

30
00:01:21,357 --> 00:01:23,367
Lastly, well, this is your team,

31
00:01:23,367 --> 00:01:27,340
a collection of line-of-business leaders and other Subject-Matter Experts

32
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:31,317
or SMEs helping to identify and collect the initiatives.

33
00:01:31,317 --> 00:01:34,887
This then can constitute your team to first distill and

34
00:01:34,887 --> 00:01:38,307
determine the initial list of initiatives.

35
00:01:38,307 --> 00:01:39,297
All right.

36
00:01:39,297 --> 00:01:43,347
Now let's look at developing project candidates.

37
00:01:43,347 --> 00:01:46,317
Here is how you might get things kicked off with your team.

38
00:01:46,317 --> 00:01:48,337
Select, invite, and assemble your team.

39
00:01:48,337 --> 00:01:52,357
Have them bring their tactical plans, initiative ideas and project ideas.

40
00:01:52,357 --> 00:01:55,367
Clearly describe purpose and outcome of your process.

41
00:01:55,367 --> 00:01:59,347
Walk them through your candidate initiatives document that you presently have.

42
00:01:59,347 --> 00:02:00,367
Next, it's the outcome.

43
00:02:00,367 --> 00:02:02,317
Make sure they understand the outcome,

44
00:02:02,317 --> 00:02:06,511
which is a list of prioritized candidate projects that drive business

45
00:02:06,511 --> 00:02:09,327
value and directly tie back to the initiatives.

46
00:02:09,327 --> 00:02:14,347
Now let's see how we can groom these initiative-driven projects.

47
00:02:14,347 --> 00:02:18,327
Here's a way to do some grooming for your project candidates with your team.

48
00:02:18,327 --> 00:02:22,357
Rank of value and benefits for each proposed project,

49
00:02:22,357 --> 00:02:26,307
such as increasing revenue, reducing cost,

50
00:02:26,307 --> 00:02:28,337
improving customer service and things like that.

51
00:02:28,337 --> 00:02:31,241
Come up with your own criteria and use those to help

52
00:02:31,241 --> 00:02:34,337
rank each one of value and benefit.

53
00:02:34,337 --> 00:02:36,387
Appraisal of risk to achieve the benefits.

54
00:02:36,387 --> 00:02:40,297
You want to probably have low risk, high benefits.

55
00:02:40,297 --> 00:02:42,337
Next, the assessment of resources, people,

56
00:02:42,337 --> 00:02:46,357
money, et cetera, that's available or not available to try to get the job done.

57
00:02:46,357 --> 00:02:48,307
The alignment of the initiatives,

58
00:02:48,307 --> 00:02:52,307
making sure that each project is truly aligned to the initiative,

59
00:02:52,307 --> 00:02:54,307
again, that's the whole point of this section,

60
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:56,347
lastly, there could be some intangible benefits.

61
00:02:56,347 --> 00:02:59,377
This just means these are things that are much more difficult to measure.

62
00:02:59,377 --> 00:03:03,377
Sometimes market share or brand image is much tougher to measure,

63
00:03:03,377 --> 00:03:06,764
but yet we do believe this initiative would help

64
00:03:06,764 --> 00:03:10,307
with brand image or market share, and lastly,

65
00:03:10,307 --> 00:03:12,387
is there going to be an effect on operations or other projects

66
00:03:12,387 --> 00:03:15,357
in doing these initiative-driven projects?

67
00:03:15,357 --> 00:03:17,297
That's important as well.

68
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:17,377
Of course,

69
00:03:17,377 --> 00:03:20,342
this is just a starter list of attributes about each

70
00:03:20,342 --> 00:03:23,347
initiative-based project that you need to collect and analyze.

71
00:03:23,347 --> 00:03:25,387
Feel free to add more of these attributes yourself.

72
00:03:25,387 --> 00:03:27,317
Now in the next section,

73
00:03:27,317 --> 00:03:36,000
we will explore a technique to determine high-value and low-risk projects. These will be the best ones to go work on.
