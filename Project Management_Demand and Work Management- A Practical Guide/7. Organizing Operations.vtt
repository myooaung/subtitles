00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:02.759
At this point,

2
00:00:02.759 --> 00:00:07.344
we know about the demand and work management activities and processes and

3
00:00:07.344 --> 00:00:10.061
have learned about several approaches to helping you out.

4
00:00:10.061 --> 00:00:13.071
Say you have a team of six people or three dozen.

5
00:00:13.071 --> 00:00:15.061
How might you organize them?

6
00:00:15.061 --> 00:00:19.561
So let's look at a variety of ways to organize your

7
00:00:19.561 --> 00:00:22.061
operational support resources.

8
00:00:22.061 --> 00:00:24.031
Here's a great quote.

9
00:00:24.031 --> 00:00:27.371
"The purpose of an organization "is to enable ordinary

10
00:00:27.371 --> 00:00:30.427
human beings "to do extraordinary things.

11
00:00:30.427 --> 00:00:33.081
" by the business genius, Peter Drucker.

12
00:00:33.081 --> 00:00:35.051
Yes, it sounds a bit lofty,

13
00:00:35.051 --> 00:00:38.368
but serious thought should be taken in determining how you

14
00:00:38.368 --> 00:00:40.091
will organize and align your resources.

15
00:00:40.091 --> 00:00:44.081
You don't want the organization to get in the way of productive work.

16
00:00:44.081 --> 00:00:45.091
So in this section,

17
00:00:45.091 --> 00:00:49.091
we will explore a bunch of different ways to slice and dice the team

18
00:00:49.091 --> 00:00:54.051
and may give you some ideas on where to start.

19
00:00:54.051 --> 00:00:56.091
Dedicated versus shared resources.

20
00:00:56.091 --> 00:00:57.415
I will provide, first,

21
00:00:57.415 --> 00:01:01.071
a general definition of each and then discuss their attributes.

22
00:01:01.071 --> 00:01:06.091
When you have a dedicated resource, that person is working on your work alone.

23
00:01:06.091 --> 00:01:09.081
You get to allocate all of his or her time.

24
00:01:09.081 --> 00:01:11.041
Shared resources.

25
00:01:11.041 --> 00:01:13.081
This person is not just yours.

26
00:01:13.081 --> 00:01:16.091
Other projects have claims on this resource too.

27
00:01:16.091 --> 00:01:16.589
Therefore,

28
00:01:16.589 --> 00:01:22.061
when and where this person's hours will be available may need to be negotiated.

29
00:01:22.061 --> 00:01:23.255
OK, for dedicated,

30
00:01:23.255 --> 00:01:27.498
you have a known budget or headcount for a customer or project,

31
00:01:27.498 --> 00:01:28.081
for example.

32
00:01:28.081 --> 00:01:34.021
But for shared, you have a known budget or headcount for anyone asking for help.

33
00:01:34.021 --> 00:01:39.021
So any one of your customers may pull and tug on those resources as needed.

34
00:01:39.021 --> 00:01:39.923
For dedicated,

35
00:01:39.923 --> 00:01:44.381
less need to track and make tickets since you are only

36
00:01:44.381 --> 00:01:47.041
working with maybe one customer or one project.

37
00:01:47.041 --> 00:01:49.011
For shared on the other hand,

38
00:01:49.011 --> 00:01:52.089
I think there's a greater need to track or make tickets since your

39
00:01:52.089 --> 00:01:55.081
time is allocated across multiple customers,

40
00:01:55.081 --> 00:01:58.492
and you need to know what percent of those resources are

41
00:01:58.492 --> 00:02:01.081
used for better managing those resources.

42
00:02:01.081 --> 00:02:06.031
Next, for dedicated, easy and direct access to your customers,

43
00:02:06.031 --> 00:02:09.031
no competition with other customers or projects.

44
00:02:09.031 --> 00:02:12.081
But for shared, less direct access to your customers,

45
00:02:12.081 --> 00:02:17.001
resources should support all customers as equally as possible.

46
00:02:17.001 --> 00:02:20.091
For dedicated, may waste unused resources.

47
00:02:20.091 --> 00:02:23.061
If the customer has lightened up on requests,

48
00:02:23.061 --> 00:02:27.051
then some of those other resources may be on the bench or have some downtime.

49
00:02:27.051 --> 00:02:30.081
For shared, better use of limited resources,

50
00:02:30.081 --> 00:02:33.061
if a customer has lightened up on requests,

51
00:02:33.061 --> 00:02:36.011
then resources can help other customers.

52
00:02:36.011 --> 00:02:36.781
For dedicated,

53
00:02:36.781 --> 00:02:42.061
a greater level of customer service since the resources are dedicated.

54
00:02:42.061 --> 00:02:45.031
They get to know the customer better and deeper.

55
00:02:45.031 --> 00:02:49.081
They can build solid relationships and likely provide better service.

56
00:02:49.081 --> 00:02:49.938
For shared,

57
00:02:49.938 --> 00:02:54.174
less level of customer service but can save money by

58
00:02:54.174 --> 00:02:57.011
spreading resources across multiple customers.

59
00:02:57.011 --> 00:03:01.051
Also, let's say you had one really big customer and 10 little ones.

60
00:03:01.051 --> 00:03:05.265
Maybe you organize one team around the one big customer and

61
00:03:05.265 --> 00:03:07.041
another team around the 10 little ones.

62
00:03:07.041 --> 00:03:13.011
Now let's look at other options to organizing your teams.

63
00:03:13.011 --> 00:03:17.001
So how should you organize your people to support operations?

64
00:03:17.001 --> 00:03:18.041
Maybe by skills.

65
00:03:18.041 --> 00:03:22.041
The developers are on one team, the business analysts are on another team,

66
00:03:22.041 --> 00:03:26.011
and the triage specialists are yet another team.

67
00:03:26.011 --> 00:03:29.011
Or collect people by platform or technology.

68
00:03:29.011 --> 00:03:31.298
Maybe you collect everyone with similar skills to

69
00:03:31.298 --> 00:03:33.081
tackle all tickets for those skills.

70
00:03:33.081 --> 00:03:37.061
Let's say you have a large suite of apps written on the Microsoft stack,

71
00:03:37.061 --> 00:03:38.536
you know, such as.

72
00:03:38.536 --> 00:03:40.011
NET, C#, and SQL,

73
00:03:40.011 --> 00:03:42.416
placing everyone together on a team to support all

74
00:03:42.416 --> 00:03:45.041
tickets within that stack may be prudent.

75
00:03:45.041 --> 00:03:48.031
Or maybe by line of business, LOB.

76
00:03:48.031 --> 00:03:51.021
People, whether a developer, business analyst,

77
00:03:51.021 --> 00:03:55.021
or other role, are together to support a line of business.

78
00:03:55.021 --> 00:03:55.250
Now,

79
00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.091
a line of business is a general term which refers to a product or service

80
00:03:59.091 --> 00:04:03.001
that serves a particular customer or business need.

81
00:04:03.001 --> 00:04:05.687
A large aerospace company may be divided,

82
00:04:05.687 --> 00:04:08.041
organizationally, by marketing, engineering,

83
00:04:08.041 --> 00:04:10.011
manufacturing, and quality.

84
00:04:10.011 --> 00:04:14.031
It may make great sense to map your supports ops by line of business.

85
00:04:14.031 --> 00:04:16.061
For complicated business organizations,

86
00:04:16.061 --> 00:04:20.493
it takes a very experienced and domain-rich set of individuals to

87
00:04:20.493 --> 00:04:24.031
provide that operational support to the highest level.

88
00:04:24.031 --> 00:04:26.091
And lastly, what I call a mix.

89
00:04:26.091 --> 00:04:30.061
And you'll see more of what I call a mix on almost every slide.

90
00:04:30.061 --> 00:04:33.091
People may be organized in a team containing some skills,

91
00:04:33.091 --> 00:04:36.071
some platform, some line of business.

92
00:04:36.071 --> 00:04:39.051
I see a lot of this, and it's not my favorite.

93
00:04:39.051 --> 00:04:39.340
OK,

94
00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:43.302
now let's drill a little deeper into the example of

95
00:04:43.302 --> 00:04:46.091
levels of skills and knowledge.

96
00:04:46.091 --> 00:04:46.687
In general,

97
00:04:46.687 --> 00:04:49.922
here are the levels of skill and knowledge required for

98
00:04:49.922 --> 00:04:52.051
each of the following categories.

99
00:04:52.051 --> 00:04:53.176
In custom built,

100
00:04:53.176 --> 00:04:56.378
you will have highly technical application development

101
00:04:56.378 --> 00:04:59.061
people with a rich domain knowledge.

102
00:04:59.061 --> 00:05:01.061
In off-the-shelf solutions,

103
00:05:01.061 --> 00:05:06.071
you need application configuration expertise and rich domain knowledge.

104
00:05:06.071 --> 00:05:10.051
You can't effectively configure a system without business domain knowledge.

105
00:05:10.051 --> 00:05:12.796
But the skill level could be more like a business

106
00:05:12.796 --> 00:05:15.061
analyst and typically not developers.

107
00:05:15.061 --> 00:05:16.051
SaaS.

108
00:05:16.051 --> 00:05:19.989
Many times SaaS applications are even easier to provision and have

109
00:05:19.989 --> 00:05:24.031
what I call super user skills may be sufficient.

110
00:05:24.031 --> 00:05:24.384
And lastly,

111
00:05:24.384 --> 00:05:29.021
the catch-all or mix may be a combination of all of the previous skillsets.

112
00:05:29.021 --> 00:05:33.031
Notice, all of them require, in my view, rich domain knowledge.

113
00:05:33.031 --> 00:05:35.081
That is a consistent thread in my opinion.

114
00:05:35.081 --> 00:05:40.521
Domain knowledge, that's an in-depth understanding of your business,

115
00:05:40.521 --> 00:05:42.011
process, and industry.

116
00:05:42.011 --> 00:05:48.041
Now let's drill a little deeper into organizing by platform and technology.

117
00:05:48.041 --> 00:05:52.011
Here's what organizing by platform or technology may look like.

118
00:05:52.011 --> 00:05:54.904
The first is custom built where you have the developers

119
00:05:54.904 --> 00:05:57.081
together and they have very similar skills.

120
00:05:57.081 --> 00:06:00.041
The second is off-the-shelf solutions.

121
00:06:00.041 --> 00:06:03.031
So not custom built, but pre-made and purchased.

122
00:06:03.031 --> 00:06:05.541
These are fully operational products that you have

123
00:06:05.541 --> 00:06:08.056
configured and purchased such as SAP, Salesforce,

124
00:06:08.056 --> 00:06:10.031
or something like that.

125
00:06:10.031 --> 00:06:14.051
So you might have a team assembled around a suite of SAP products, for example.

126
00:06:14.051 --> 00:06:17.051
Next is SaaS, software as a service,

127
00:06:17.051 --> 00:06:20.031
is basically an off-the-shelf solution in the cloud.

128
00:06:20.031 --> 00:06:24.419
SaaS is a software licensing and delivery model in which software is

129
00:06:24.419 --> 00:06:28.051
licensed on a subscription basis and is centrally hosted.

130
00:06:28.051 --> 00:06:32.091
SaaS is typically accessed by users using a thin client or web browser.

131
00:06:32.091 --> 00:06:32.792
Nonetheless,

132
00:06:32.792 --> 00:06:38.516
all SaaS solutions have administrator portals so that people can configure,

133
00:06:38.516 --> 00:06:40.031
monitor, and use the system.

134
00:06:40.031 --> 00:06:44.041
And again, you may have a team assembled around one or more SaaS solutions.

135
00:06:44.041 --> 00:06:47.081
Some examples may be Microsoft Office 365,

136
00:06:47.081 --> 00:06:51.001
Atlassian's Confluence or Jira, and Box.

137
00:06:51.001 --> 00:06:51.605
And lastly,

138
00:06:51.605 --> 00:06:55.513
the catch-all or mix of all of these may be needed to support a

139
00:06:55.513 --> 00:06:58.011
business unit or portions of an organization.

140
00:06:58.011 --> 00:07:00.081
Also keep in mind that customer may not care.

141
00:07:00.081 --> 00:07:03.041
You want to operate and support your applications,

142
00:07:03.041 --> 00:07:03.468
systems,

143
00:07:03.468 --> 00:07:10.001
and platforms in such a way as to make your customer as efficient as possible

144
00:07:10.001 --> 00:07:14.011
and the seams between the systems as transparent as possible.

145
00:07:14.011 --> 00:07:14.164
Now,

146
00:07:14.164 --> 00:07:16.573
let's drill a little deeper into different examples

147
00:07:16.573 --> 00:07:21.051
of organizing by line of business.

148
00:07:21.051 --> 00:07:24.041
Now let's see the different flavors of line of business.

149
00:07:24.041 --> 00:07:26.061
Maybe you want to organize around industry.

150
00:07:26.061 --> 00:07:30.071
For example, a team of all different skills support education.

151
00:07:30.071 --> 00:07:33.031
Or another one, say, government agencies.

152
00:07:33.031 --> 00:07:35.051
Or you organize around business verticals,

153
00:07:35.051 --> 00:07:38.279
for example, engineering, marketing, finance,

154
00:07:38.279 --> 00:07:39.081
things like that.

155
00:07:39.081 --> 00:07:44.011
Or regionally, such as US, Europe, Asia.

156
00:07:44.011 --> 00:07:47.001
And lastly, our catch-all, which is mix.

157
00:07:47.001 --> 00:07:49.081
Maybe everyone is supporting everything.

158
00:07:49.081 --> 00:07:52.731
But you can imagine if a regional is Europe and another

159
00:07:52.731 --> 00:07:55.643
regional was North America that language,

160
00:07:55.643 --> 00:08:01.081
customs, currencies, religions, and business practices could all be so different.

161
00:08:01.081 --> 00:08:05.061
So having dedicated teams per region may be the best thing.

162
00:08:05.061 --> 00:08:11.041
Alright, now let's explore other organizational dynamics.

163
00:08:11.041 --> 00:08:14.001
So which is the best way to organize your team?

164
00:08:14.001 --> 00:08:16.051
Well, there's no one right answer.

165
00:08:16.051 --> 00:08:19.529
But I wanted you to be aware of the myriad of approaches to

166
00:08:19.529 --> 00:08:22.021
structuring your ops support organization.

167
00:08:22.021 --> 00:08:26.021
And it is dynamic, and there is another dimension of things to think about.

168
00:08:26.021 --> 00:08:27.071
Let's go through them.

169
00:08:27.071 --> 00:08:30.001
Constantly review your support structure,

170
00:08:30.001 --> 00:08:34.001
your customers, and the business since it's changing all the time.

171
00:08:34.001 --> 00:08:37.021
Making adjustments to your team is good leadership.

172
00:08:37.021 --> 00:08:39.011
Attrition may drive changes.

173
00:08:39.011 --> 00:08:40.091
If you lose some of your key people,

174
00:08:40.091 --> 00:08:43.031
hence you are losing some skills and knowledge,

175
00:08:43.031 --> 00:08:45.031
don't be afraid to make changes.

176
00:08:45.031 --> 00:08:47.061
New hires may drive opportunities.

177
00:08:47.061 --> 00:08:52.351
New people in your organization means new skills and knowledge which would

178
00:08:52.351 --> 00:08:56.011
allow you to make positive adjustments to your organization.

179
00:08:56.011 --> 00:08:58.091
Also rotate people through different roles.

180
00:08:58.091 --> 00:09:02.081
I am a huge believer in knowledge transfer between your team members.

181
00:09:02.081 --> 00:09:05.081
This allows you to have more resiliency to attrition,

182
00:09:05.081 --> 00:09:07.041
expand people's skillsets,

183
00:09:07.041 --> 00:09:11.031
and you'll sleep better at night as well with less worries.

184
00:09:11.031 --> 00:09:15.041
Make customer service an absolute requirement of your team.

185
00:09:15.041 --> 00:09:18.081
Be sure you train and coach your team on customer service.

186
00:09:18.081 --> 00:09:21.001
Users are not trying to ruin your day.

187
00:09:21.001 --> 00:09:23.031
They just are trying to get the job done,

188
00:09:23.031 --> 00:09:27.031
and at times technology gets in the way and you can help them.

189
00:09:27.031 --> 00:09:29.071
Your greatest asset is your people.

190
00:09:29.071 --> 00:09:38.000
Love and care for them at all times. Now let's summarize this module in the next slide.
