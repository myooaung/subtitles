00:00:00.683 --> 00:00:06.683
Now, let's discuss the Agile Scrum process groups in this section.

2
00:00:06.683 --> 00:00:08.713
Here's the definition of process group.

3
00:00:08.713 --> 00:00:12.693
A process group denotes a collection of one or more processes.

4
00:00:12.693 --> 00:00:14.683
Not too complicated, certainly.

5
00:00:14.683 --> 00:00:19.633
An example is the five phases of traditional project management that we covered,

6
00:00:19.633 --> 00:00:21.713
they're also known as process groups.

7
00:00:21.713 --> 00:00:25.663
Within each one of those process groups, there were other subprocesses.

8
00:00:25.663 --> 00:00:29.623
Now let me introduce you to the Agile Scrum process groups.

9
00:00:29.623 --> 00:00:30.693
And then later in this module,

10
00:00:30.693 --> 00:00:33.557
we're going to compare the two process groups between

11
00:00:33.557 --> 00:00:38.623
the Agile Scrum and the traditional.

12
00:00:38.623 --> 00:00:41.703
With traditional project management, we had five process groups,

13
00:00:41.703 --> 00:00:46.633
conception and initiation, planning, execution,

14
00:00:46.633 --> 00:00:49.663
performance and monitoring, and lastly, closure.

15
00:00:49.663 --> 00:00:52.653
With Agile there are four process groups.

16
00:00:52.653 --> 00:00:53.663
And here they are.

17
00:00:53.663 --> 00:00:57.703
The first, projects, the second, releases,

18
00:00:57.703 --> 00:01:02.653
the third, iterations, and the fourth, daily work.

19
00:01:02.653 --> 00:01:08.663
Now, let's go through each of these in detail in the next four slides.

20
00:01:08.663 --> 00:01:10.703
Agile projects are kicked off with the following.

21
00:01:10.703 --> 00:01:13.683
Develop vision and product roadmap.

22
00:01:13.683 --> 00:01:16.663
This is where you define the overall project goal.

23
00:01:16.663 --> 00:01:17.713
Select the Scrum team.

24
00:01:17.713 --> 00:01:22.683
That includes the Product Owner, the development team and the Scrum Master.

25
00:01:22.683 --> 00:01:25.683
Perform high-level release planning, very high!

26
00:01:25.683 --> 00:01:28.623
Subject to change but a general idea.

27
00:01:28.623 --> 00:01:31.653
This would also include a timeframe for release delivery.

28
00:01:31.653 --> 00:01:33.683
Determine your product backlog definition,

29
00:01:33.683 --> 00:01:35.663
not so much the items themselves,

30
00:01:35.663 --> 00:01:38.683
what this means is how are you going to manage and maintain the backlog,

31
00:01:38.683 --> 00:01:40.703
what columns of information will you need.

32
00:01:40.703 --> 00:01:43.673
Identify high level features and functionality.

33
00:01:43.673 --> 00:01:47.643
Again, very high level, subject to change but a general idea.

34
00:01:47.643 --> 00:01:49.713
These items can be your starter backlog list.

35
00:01:49.713 --> 00:01:50.693
When the project is complete,

36
00:01:50.693 --> 00:01:55.693
you will return to the project process group and perform project wrap-up.

37
00:01:55.693 --> 00:01:58.186
That might include things like stakeholders getting

38
00:01:58.186 --> 00:02:00.673
together and talking about how it went.

39
00:02:00.673 --> 00:02:03.703
Customers might come as well, do project reflection,

40
00:02:03.703 --> 00:02:06.633
recommend improvements, if you need them.

41
00:02:06.633 --> 00:02:08.173
And maybe handle any sort of contractual

42
00:02:08.173 --> 00:02:09.713
administrative closure that you might need.

43
00:02:09.713 --> 00:02:10.042
Now,

44
00:02:10.042 --> 00:02:13.524
there may also be other items to discuss in project

45
00:02:13.524 --> 00:02:15.653
planning such as project start-up.

46
00:02:15.653 --> 00:02:18.703
Elements that would be part of project start-up may be the environment set-up.

47
00:02:18.703 --> 00:02:21.688
You might need computers, architectural documentation,

48
00:02:21.688 --> 00:02:25.653
coding standards and all sorts of things that you might also need.

49
00:02:25.653 --> 00:02:30.643
Do what you think needs to be accomplished to prepare the team.

50
00:02:30.643 --> 00:02:31.713
Projects have releases, that is,

51
00:02:31.713 --> 00:02:35.693
a project will be made up of a series of product releases.

52
00:02:35.693 --> 00:02:38.643
For each release planning will be organized.

53
00:02:38.643 --> 00:02:39.713
Key team members attend.

54
00:02:39.713 --> 00:02:43.693
The Product Owner, the Scrum Master and the development team.

55
00:02:43.693 --> 00:02:47.633
The planning produces a release plan, a guide for the team.

56
00:02:47.633 --> 00:02:49.683
If you had 10 releases in a project,

57
00:02:49.683 --> 00:02:52.643
you would have had 10 release planning sessions.

58
00:02:52.643 --> 00:02:55.713
The release planning will produce a list of features that is a product backlog,

59
00:02:55.713 --> 00:02:59.703
the team will prioritize and estimate each item for this release,

60
00:02:59.703 --> 00:03:01.653
goals and assumptions,

61
00:03:01.653 --> 00:03:05.333
determine if there are any goals to be accomplished and also are there any

62
00:03:05.333 --> 00:03:07.673
assumptions that need to be addressed for this release.

63
00:03:07.673 --> 00:03:09.703
As with the project process group,

64
00:03:09.703 --> 00:03:13.275
when the release is complete you'll return to the release

65
00:03:13.275 --> 00:03:15.713
process group and perform release wrap-up.

66
00:03:15.713 --> 00:03:17.693
This includes key members.

67
00:03:17.693 --> 00:03:21.003
Here you will recommend improvements that you want to leverage in

68
00:03:21.003 --> 00:03:24.623
the next release or across other Agile projects.

69
00:03:24.623 --> 00:03:28.623
Now let's see what makes up a release.

70
00:03:28.623 --> 00:03:30.623
Releases have iterations.

71
00:03:30.623 --> 00:03:33.801
There are multiple iterations per release just as there

72
00:03:33.801 --> 00:03:35.663
are multiple releases per project.

73
00:03:35.663 --> 00:03:37.643
Iterations are planned, that is,

74
00:03:37.643 --> 00:03:40.673
the list of features is decided that will be part of the iteration.

75
00:03:40.673 --> 00:03:43.683
Basically, an iteration is a subset of the release.

76
00:03:43.683 --> 00:03:46.623
An iteration is like a timebox of work.

77
00:03:46.623 --> 00:03:50.653
A sprint is equal to an iteration and we talked about that in the last module.

78
00:03:50.653 --> 00:03:53.826
Some iteration characteristics are: contains a list of

79
00:03:53.826 --> 00:03:57.673
features to build and by the way, they are chosen by the team on the sprint,

80
00:03:57.673 --> 00:04:01.019
tasks are assigned to all team members and a sprint or

81
00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:04.273
iteration is a fixed duration of time and may range from one

82
00:04:04.273 --> 00:04:08.653
to four weeks in duration though, two or three seems pretty typical.

83
00:04:08.653 --> 00:04:12.633
They have a fixed start date, for example May 1st and a fixed end date,

84
00:04:12.633 --> 00:04:13.713
for example, May 22nd.

85
00:04:13.713 --> 00:04:18.643
Now let's see what comprises an iteration.

86
00:04:18.643 --> 00:04:22.643
Daily work is what the team does everyday within an iteration.

87
00:04:22.643 --> 00:04:25.643
Several days of work make up an iteration or sprint.

88
00:04:25.643 --> 00:04:27.673
The team will be working on assigned features,

89
00:04:27.673 --> 00:04:29.703
each team member on one or more tasks,

90
00:04:29.703 --> 00:04:33.643
you will conduct daily stand-ups to share status in progress,

91
00:04:33.643 --> 00:04:35.245
there'll be meetings with the Scrum Master,

92
00:04:35.245 --> 00:04:38.013
as needed, there'll be meetings with the Product Owners,

93
00:04:38.013 --> 00:04:40.373
as needed and you'll probably use some automated and visual

94
00:04:40.373 --> 00:04:43.421
tools to show features in the backlog, in work,

95
00:04:43.421 --> 00:04:46.673
and QA, and complete, et cetera, such as the tool JIRA.

96
00:04:46.673 --> 00:04:50.633
Then the team completes work in the iteration, that is, a sprint.

97
00:04:50.633 --> 00:04:51.623
Now a note.

98
00:04:51.623 --> 00:04:54.703
What I have shared with you is not perfect or the way to do it.

99
00:04:54.703 --> 00:04:58.683
Every company has their own flavor and that is what's great about Agile.

100
00:04:58.683 --> 00:05:05.000
Adapt it to your environment and do not be afraid to tweak it to meet your needs.
