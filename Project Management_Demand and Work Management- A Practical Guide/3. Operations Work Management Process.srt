00:00:02,004 --> 00:00:04,994
Operations Work Management Process.

2
00:00:04,994 --> 00:00:06,014
In the previous section,

3
00:00:06,014 --> 00:00:10,044
we talked about just what the operational role is and its activities.

4
00:00:10,044 --> 00:00:13,999
Now we want to talk about how we want to execute and manage

5
00:00:13,999 --> 00:00:18,984
that work through a work management process.

6
00:00:18,984 --> 00:00:22,004
Let's recap our demand sources for operations.

7
00:00:22,004 --> 00:00:24,974
Pretty much, everything is going to come through from verbal,

8
00:00:24,974 --> 00:00:28,019
phone, email, forms, and tickets themselves,

9
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:29,034
of course.

10
00:00:29,034 --> 00:00:32,014
And what do we do with those requests for services?

11
00:00:32,014 --> 00:00:35,054
Let's check it out in the next slide.

12
00:00:35,054 --> 00:00:37,014
In the operations world,

13
00:00:37,014 --> 00:00:41,044
everything is a ticket or certainly should be in my humble opinion.

14
00:00:41,044 --> 00:00:45,004
Trust me, this makes life so, so much easier.

15
00:00:45,004 --> 00:00:47,024
You may think, "Ah, what a pain.

16
00:00:47,024 --> 00:00:49,783
"I need to open a ticket or add to a ticket.

17
00:00:49,783 --> 00:00:54,034
" But it is an essential tool for all operations work.

18
00:00:54,034 --> 00:00:57,024
The operations world can be crazy busy.

19
00:00:57,024 --> 00:01:00,034
If you don't track your tickets, you can't measure.

20
00:01:00,034 --> 00:01:03,974
If you don't measure, you cannot improve.

21
00:01:03,974 --> 00:01:06,034
So go find a tool and use it.

22
00:01:06,034 --> 00:01:09,034
I will talk a bit about tools in the summary module.

23
00:01:09,034 --> 00:01:13,044
Now on to the operations ticket process.

24
00:01:13,044 --> 00:01:17,984
Here is the operations ticket process at a very high level.

25
00:01:17,984 --> 00:01:20,897
We have done our triage and backlog grooming like we

26
00:01:20,897 --> 00:01:23,004
discussed in the previous module.

27
00:01:23,004 --> 00:01:26,014
Now we have all of our approved tickets,

28
00:01:26,014 --> 00:01:28,004
some of which may be hot production fixes,

29
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:30,044
and we're going to have to get on those ASAP,

30
00:01:30,044 --> 00:01:33,024
and others will be what I call normal work.

31
00:01:33,024 --> 00:01:37,004
Either way, the tickets are basically all treated the same.

32
00:01:37,004 --> 00:01:38,064
Now, this is a very high level.

33
00:01:38,064 --> 00:01:39,054
Now, the next slide,

34
00:01:39,054 --> 00:01:45,064
I want to go through a detailed timeline of events in the life of a ticket.

35
00:01:45,064 --> 00:01:48,024
Here's a timeline of ticket events.

36
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:49,974
The first event is approval.

37
00:01:49,974 --> 00:01:54,004
Demand management approves and releases the ticket after triage.

38
00:01:54,004 --> 00:01:55,984
Next, it is assigned.

39
00:01:55,984 --> 00:02:00,004
Resources are assigned and allocated and the ticket is updated.

40
00:02:00,004 --> 00:02:02,064
Resources meaning one or more people may be assigned,

41
00:02:02,064 --> 00:02:07,014
and the ticket then collects additional information about who was assigned.

42
00:02:07,014 --> 00:02:09,054
Next, well, the work is in progress.

43
00:02:09,054 --> 00:02:14,024
Work is being performed, and the ticket can be periodically updated with status.

44
00:02:14,024 --> 00:02:16,994
Next, it's ready for QA, the work is done.

45
00:02:16,994 --> 00:02:19,984
So the resources prepare for customer testing and buy off,

46
00:02:19,984 --> 00:02:22,014
and the ticket again is updated.

47
00:02:22,014 --> 00:02:24,034
Next, customer approval.

48
00:02:24,034 --> 00:02:27,974
The customer tests and approves or rejects a ticket,

49
00:02:27,974 --> 00:02:29,064
and then a ticket is updated as well.

50
00:02:29,064 --> 00:02:33,064
Now, if the ticket is rejected, it flows back to work in progress,

51
00:02:33,064 --> 00:02:37,034
and it'll be ready for QA again and ready for customer approval.

52
00:02:37,034 --> 00:02:39,044
But if the customer approves the ticket,

53
00:02:39,044 --> 00:02:41,054
then it's scheduled for production,

54
00:02:41,054 --> 00:02:45,984
and the resources hand off to devops or maybe installs themselves,

55
00:02:45,984 --> 00:02:48,064
and the ticket information is updated again.

56
00:02:48,064 --> 00:02:51,014
And lastly, ticket closure.

57
00:02:51,014 --> 00:02:54,064
To me, it can only be closed by the ticket creator.

58
00:02:54,064 --> 00:02:57,974
And then the ticket information is updated again.

59
00:02:57,974 --> 00:03:01,024
Now, this is just a general process, and you may have your own,

60
00:03:01,024 --> 00:03:05,044
but be sure you document it and communicate it to all users of the process.

61
00:03:05,044 --> 00:03:10,145
Tracking your work is, to me, an absolute priority and benefit to you,

62
00:03:10,145 --> 00:03:14,024
your customers, and your management.

63
00:03:14,024 --> 00:03:15,044
Here's a tip.

64
00:03:15,044 --> 00:03:19,034
Have a process for managing the workflow of your ticket events.

65
00:03:19,034 --> 00:03:21,034
And here's a way to maybe do that.

66
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:24,004
To design it with your team, just don't force it on them.

67
00:03:24,004 --> 00:03:27,034
Get together as a team and come up with your own design.

68
00:03:27,034 --> 00:03:29,014
Build it, though, using an automated tool.

69
00:03:29,014 --> 00:03:30,044
There are so many out there.

70
00:03:30,044 --> 00:03:33,024
And again, the summary module will talk about some of the tools.

71
00:03:33,024 --> 00:03:36,024
And get buy in, not only from a team,

72
00:03:36,024 --> 00:03:39,984
but key users as well because they'll be main participants.

73
00:03:39,984 --> 00:03:42,994
Then use it and improve it over time.

74
00:03:42,994 --> 00:03:46,044
Now, my previous slide was a very simplified workflow process.

75
00:03:46,044 --> 00:03:49,251
Many automated tools have workflow templates that

76
00:03:49,251 --> 00:03:51,054
you can use and customize as well.

77
00:03:51,054 --> 00:03:59,000
I suggest you start with one of those and then tweak it to meet your needs. Now let's go check out kanban.
