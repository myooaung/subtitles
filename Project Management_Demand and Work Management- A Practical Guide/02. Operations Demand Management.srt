1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:04,088
So what do the demand types, operations,

2
00:00:04,088 --> 00:00:07,380
projects, and initiatives, all have in common?

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:10,330
Well, you need to collect your demand items,

4
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:13,340
they must be organized with value and benefits,

5
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:17,350
they are tracked and made available for everyone to see and understand,

6
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:20,300
and lastly, and maybe even most importantly,

7
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:21,380
you must prioritize them.

8
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:26,017
The outcome of these simple steps is a collection of well

9
00:00:26,017 --> 00:00:30,310
organized and tracked demand items in priority order.

10
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:33,615
So at a macro level, demand for operations,

11
00:00:33,615 --> 00:00:38,340
projects, and initiatives all need to follow this general process.

12
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:44,340
Now let's go to more detail for all three demand types.

13
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,350
Operations Demand Management.

14
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:51,223
This section contains my recommendations of the basics you need

15
00:00:51,223 --> 00:00:54,350
for setting up your operations demand process.

16
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:58,320
Think of this as a starter kit or approach for you and your team,

17
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,350
and modify it as you see fit.

18
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:04,300
Okay, let's get started.

19
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:07,380
Let's define, in general, what ticket means.

20
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,290
For this course,

21
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:14,380
a ticket is a representation of an instance of potential work to perform,

22
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:17,310
that is a demand request.

23
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:18,320
For each ticket,

24
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,898
you must capture key attributes that'll help you make good

25
00:01:21,898 --> 00:01:24,330
decisions about what to do with this ticket.

26
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:28,010
Sometimes the term ticket is also called an issue,

27
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:31,360
requirement, feature, or other term.

28
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,310
Call it anything you want,

29
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:39,330
as long as you understand it is a unit of potential work in your demand queue.

30
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:45,340
Okay, let's talk about where do these tickets come from.

31
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:49,380
If you give users or customers access to an issue or ticketing system,

32
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:50,370
well, that's great.

33
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:54,300
They can start the process there by entering their own tickets,

34
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,310
and if not,

35
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:59,135
all these are sources of tickets and they must map or

36
00:01:59,135 --> 00:02:03,340
be transposed into a real ticket, a potential unit of work.

37
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:06,840
So tickets could come initially from: verbal discussions,

38
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,380
phone calls, emails, form-based systems or applications,

39
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:16,812
and of course, tickets themselves, and everything becomes a ticket,

40
00:02:16,812 --> 00:02:17,310
period.

41
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:20,766
Everything should drive and become a ticket and that way you can

42
00:02:20,766 --> 00:02:24,350
collect them and track them and manage them.

43
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:28,370
So now that we have a bunch of tickets flowing in, what is the next step?

44
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:32,340
Let's find out.

45
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,360
Operations for New Tickets.

46
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,300
Here's the process.

47
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,300
This slide represents a new ticket.

48
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:42,370
They have come in from the potential demand sources on the previous slide.

49
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:47,049
The new ticket queue or backlog must be monitored by someone

50
00:02:47,049 --> 00:02:51,350
or a team or maybe alerts are sent to someone so they know

51
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:52,370
something requires assessing.

52
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:55,370
We sometimes call this assessment triage,

53
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:58,845
and you may have heard of that term in those medical or hospital shows

54
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:02,330
on TV when the patient comes into the emergency room.

55
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:05,380
You want to perform this triage, if possible as a team,

56
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:09,320
but maybe based on resources, a single person may do this.

57
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,700
With some of the new tools today, you could use Jira,

58
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:12,360
for example,

59
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,087
and then use Slack to have a quick call or video or shared

60
00:03:16,087 --> 00:03:18,300
screen to quickly assess with others.

61
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,340
Certainly there are many tools to do this.

62
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:24,340
Now the ticket can be triaged into one of three cases.

63
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:27,380
Case number one, the one ticket belongs to another group or team.

64
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:30,330
In other words, it doesn't really belong to you.

65
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:32,330
It's not part of your responsibility.

66
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:35,675
So you want to reassign it to another queue or another backlog

67
00:03:35,675 --> 00:03:40,525
since it does not apply to you and your team at all or maybe the

68
00:03:40,525 --> 00:03:44,932
ticket is just not applicable or bogus or it is returned to the

69
00:03:44,932 --> 00:03:46,300
ticket creator with a reason.

70
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:49,310
Now case two, the ticket does belong to your team,

71
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:52,330
and then it is super-hot production issue.

72
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:55,589
So you want to assign it immediately to a person

73
00:03:55,589 --> 00:03:57,380
responsible to get this ticket done.

74
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:00,594
This means you have to have some documentation and

75
00:04:00,594 --> 00:04:02,360
process for triage to handle this.

76
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:06,290
Case three, the ticket belongs to your team as well,

77
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:09,290
but it's not critical like in case number two.

78
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,585
You want to place it in the backlog queue,

79
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:16,310
and if possible, add a few attributes like a rough estimate,

80
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:19,290
maybe it's small, medium, large or jumbo.

81
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:23,177
I like to call this case the normal case since most

82
00:04:23,177 --> 00:04:25,370
tickets will likely drop here.

83
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:30,290
So we have three cases: doesn't belong to you at all in case one,

84
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:33,310
not applicable, case two, it's a production issue,

85
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:36,360
you have to assign this ASAP, as soon as possible,

86
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:40,310
and begin working, in other words, it's approved and in work,

87
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:42,370
it never had a moment to be in your backlog,

88
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:46,380
and then the normal case, case three, is what I call your normal ticket.

89
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:50,310
It goes into the backlog for later grooming.

90
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:54,300
Now this is just a simple high-level process to give you

91
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,300
the general essence of the workflow.

92
00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:05,000
Certainly yours may be more elaborate. Now let's move on to operations backlog and tickets in the next section.
