00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:04.500
This section will define what activities make up Initiative Work

2
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.960
Management and the Portfolio Management Office.

3
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.900
Now we are on the other side of the spectrum.

4
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:10.925
This is the big,

5
00:00:10.925 --> 00:00:14.930
strategic and quite frankly it can be a bit fuzzier side of the work management.

6
00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.583
Yet in my opinion it is the most critical of the three work types for

7
00:00:19.583 --> 00:00:22.880
the long-term success of your organization or company.

8
00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:23.960
So we'll explore further,

9
00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.937
and yes you had another PMO abbreviation and for this

10
00:00:27.937 --> 00:00:32.696
module I just want to emphasize that the PMO stands for

11
00:00:32.696 --> 00:00:34.940
the Portfolio Management Office.

12
00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.930
Are your initiatives successfully implemented.

13
00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.910
That is are your strategic plans and visions successfully fulfilled?

14
00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:49.880
89% of high-performing organizations use the concept of portfolio management.

15
00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.910
The point of this slide is that the success of initiatives,

16
00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.960
those very large complex and strategic chunks of work,

17
00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.940
must be managed by leveraging the best practices of portfolio management.

18
00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.411
So for this class I will be using the term portfolio management to

19
00:01:05.411 --> 00:01:10.910
represent the management and implementation of initiatives.

20
00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.920
Let's recap the demand sources for initiatives.

21
00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.910
If you recall we have the Board of Directors,

22
00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.900
Steering Groups throughout the company.

23
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.880
Senior executives which should also include your CIO or CTO,

24
00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:23.940
and business leaders.

25
00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.950
The initiative is the goal, the endgame,

26
00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.950
and the projects are a means to achieve those initiatives.

27
00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.900
Initiatives require projects or programs to be successful.

28
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:36.960
They are the engine.

29
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.396
Also these initiative based projects here are the biggies and

30
00:01:40.396 --> 00:01:42.950
very important strategically for the company.

31
00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:43.379
Conversely,

32
00:01:43.379 --> 00:01:46.801
projects spawn from the operations side are smaller

33
00:01:46.801 --> 00:01:48.930
and more tactical in general.

34
00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.930
So who or what is going to manage all of this?

35
00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.960
Let's look at the organizational construct of a Portfolio Management Office.

36
00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.880
Before we jump into the portfolio management office,

37
00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.890
we will first define portfolio and then portfolio management.

38
00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.559
A portfolio is a collection of programs,

39
00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:12.460
projects or operations managed as a group to

40
00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.960
achieve a strategic business purpose.

41
00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.960
Now I want to highlight a few items.

42
00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:22.131
A collection is a thoughtful grouping of business entities that

43
00:02:22.131 --> 00:02:25.613
are comprised of one or more parts of an existing

44
00:02:25.613 --> 00:02:27.910
organization's operations including projects,

45
00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.970
project management offices and programs.

46
00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:35.405
Also I'd like to re-emphasize a portfolio is targeted or tied to one

47
00:02:35.405 --> 00:02:37.970
or more strategic business goals or initiatives.

48
00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.960
So you can't have a portfolio just kind of hanging out there.

49
00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.960
It must be tied to initiatives.

50
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.057
So that is why we call the organization that is responsible for managing

51
00:02:47.057 --> 00:02:49.890
and implementing the business strategies and initiatives,

52
00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.920
the Portfolio Management Office.

53
00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.910
Now let's further define portfolio management.

54
00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.890
Managing portfolios does not involve literally running the projects or programs.

55
00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.781
Those will be run by other parts of the organization or by

56
00:03:04.781 --> 00:03:08.400
program or project management offices within operational

57
00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.890
organizational structures,

58
00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.390
but it does involve designing the portfolios and choosing which programs

59
00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.900
and projects to execute as part of those portfolios.

60
00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.910
A typical company may have several portfolios.

61
00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.880
Now let's talk a little bit more about the Portfolio Management Office,

62
00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:30.940
now that we've defined portfolio and the term portfolio management.

63
00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.900
The need for a portfolio management office.

64
00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:34.930
So why have one?

65
00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.960
First organizations today are actually pretty good at managing

66
00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.950
individual projects or even a small number of projects,

67
00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.806
and some employee project management offices and that is

68
00:03:45.806 --> 00:03:47.920
relatively easy to tackle for most companies,

69
00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.970
and those projects are typically spawned from operations

70
00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.910
or a mid-level management directive.

71
00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.890
Now challenges arise when there are multiple,

72
00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:59.930
large complex projects with limited resources.

73
00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:04.076
Now a company may have projects all over the place and the executive management

74
00:04:04.076 --> 00:04:06.900
will be wondering if they are getting their money's worth,

75
00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.960
and is that money being spent on doing the right work.

76
00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:14.890
So it is critical therefore to establish an organizational structure,

77
00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.420
their Portfolio Management Office and that office then acts

78
00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:22.419
as the initiative process owner and the stewards of the

79
00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:23.900
company's strategic investments.

80
00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.920
Now let's drill a little deeper on what PMO's are solving.

81
00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.880
Solving business challenges with PMOs.

82
00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.960
So most businesses have similar challenges.

83
00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.497
A solid portfolio management structure will go a long

84
00:04:37.497 --> 00:04:38.950
way in solving these challenges.

85
00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:41.890
Okay, here are some challenges.

86
00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:43.880
Too many projects to invest in.

87
00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.516
There is always too much work,

88
00:04:45.516 --> 00:04:48.930
so how do you decide just what is the best things to work on?

89
00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.910
Difficulty aligning projects and programs with initiatives.

90
00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:55.646
There needs to be a central place to help ensure

91
00:04:55.646 --> 00:04:57.930
projects are aligned with the initiatives.

92
00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:01.960
Inadequate measurement and approaches to benefits, costs and risks.

93
00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.930
Everyone wants their project or project to be approved,

94
00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:09.425
but you really need to also look at the benefits to the business,

95
00:05:09.425 --> 00:05:12.960
costs and risks, and this takes an independent group.

96
00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.940
In over-emphasis on project execution versus project selection,

97
00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:19.950
grooming and alignment.

98
00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:23.890
That is why we spent the early modules focus on demand management.

99
00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:26.465
Everyone seems to focus on the execution side and

100
00:05:26.465 --> 00:05:28.940
not on proper project selection.

101
00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:32.950
Note to self this is one of the biggest takeaways of this course.

102
00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:36.900
Quality demand management and project selection.

103
00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:40.900
Next operations could be ignored, when they should not.

104
00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.960
Again there is this desire to only focus on projects.

105
00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:49.970
Most times projects must include, be aware of or in some fashion relate to,

106
00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:52.950
existing operations to be successful.

107
00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:56.890
For example you may need some of the resources in the ops groups,

108
00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:59.950
or you may be implementing a new system that affects the ops groups,

109
00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:01.960
and I could come up with many more examples.

110
00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:03.970
Hence don't forget about ops.

111
00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:08.880
Lastly lack of total picture of business investments.

112
00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:12.094
Typically many projects don't see the world from the top down,

113
00:06:12.094 --> 00:06:13.900
but rather from the bottom up.

114
00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:17.665
It is best to manage the initiative driven project process with the

115
00:06:17.665 --> 00:06:20.930
entire business or a large segment of the business,

116
00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:29.000
both of which from the investment perspective. Now let's go into more detail about the PMO processes in the next section.
