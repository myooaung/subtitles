1
00:00:01,668 --> 00:00:08,628
In this section, we'll define what activities make up operations.

2
00:00:08,628 --> 00:00:12,698
Your goal or mission in operations is the following.

3
00:00:12,698 --> 00:00:18,158
Make it as easy as possible for your users and customers to maximize

4
00:00:18,158 --> 00:00:22,638
their productivity in doing their daily activities.

5
00:00:22,638 --> 00:00:25,678
You exist to service your customers.

6
00:00:25,678 --> 00:00:28,698
You want a frictionless interface with your customers.

7
00:00:28,698 --> 00:00:32,658
You want it easy for them to access you and your team,

8
00:00:32,658 --> 00:00:34,678
to help them get things done.

9
00:00:34,678 --> 00:00:35,708
Here's the takeaway.

10
00:00:35,708 --> 00:00:39,939
Your customers are using your applications and systems every

11
00:00:39,939 --> 00:00:42,648
minute of every day to get their job done.

12
00:00:42,648 --> 00:00:45,618
You exist to service your customers.

13
00:00:45,618 --> 00:00:46,638
Do not forget that.

14
00:00:46,638 --> 00:00:52,628
Now let's look at the general scope of activities within operation.

15
00:00:52,628 --> 00:00:56,618
Here are some examples of application operational activities.

16
00:00:56,618 --> 00:00:59,893
All of these application items that I'm about to share with you could,

17
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:02,638
in fact, be managed and run by the application teams,

18
00:01:02,638 --> 00:01:03,698
especially in smaller companies.

19
00:01:03,698 --> 00:01:05,628
That is totally fine.

20
00:01:05,628 --> 00:01:09,098
The important thing is that you understand as a manager and leader that

21
00:01:09,098 --> 00:01:11,586
there are operational responsibilities that either you,

22
00:01:11,586 --> 00:01:14,708
your team, or a dedicated ops team must manage and address.

23
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:18,618
These examples here are generally customer-facing.

24
00:01:18,618 --> 00:01:21,668
Help desk or call center duties are sometimes split between an IT

25
00:01:21,668 --> 00:01:25,638
applications help desk and an IT operations help desk.

26
00:01:25,638 --> 00:01:28,658
Usually, the operations help desk is what they call level one,

27
00:01:28,658 --> 00:01:32,638
and the application or system help desk sometimes is called level two.

28
00:01:32,638 --> 00:01:34,668
ID or access management.

29
00:01:34,668 --> 00:01:39,618
People need access to their applications or specific roles and permissions.

30
00:01:39,618 --> 00:01:41,708
So they need IDs for this, and permission settings.

31
00:01:41,708 --> 00:01:44,708
Sometimes this is managed centrally by operations.

32
00:01:44,708 --> 00:01:46,698
Production or hot fixes.

33
00:01:46,698 --> 00:01:49,678
Something is broke and it must be fixed ASAP,

34
00:01:49,678 --> 00:01:52,678
and sometimes the operation group gets right on it.

35
00:01:52,678 --> 00:01:53,688
Escalation.

36
00:01:53,688 --> 00:01:58,625
You need a clear escalation path from when an issue is determined,

37
00:01:58,625 --> 00:02:01,678
who is informed, and move quickly up your chart as needed.

38
00:02:01,678 --> 00:02:05,025
You may need approvals for more resources or access to subject

39
00:02:05,025 --> 00:02:07,648
matter experts that are beyond your pay grade.

40
00:02:07,648 --> 00:02:11,618
So you would need to escalate the issue to get the necessary approvals.

41
00:02:11,618 --> 00:02:15,618
The ops role is always looking to find, fix, and inform.

42
00:02:15,618 --> 00:02:16,698
Small updates and features.

43
00:02:16,698 --> 00:02:21,628
These are code changes that are small and are handled directly by the ops team.

44
00:02:21,628 --> 00:02:24,698
Now you need to decide what small means, of course, that is level of effort.

45
00:02:24,698 --> 00:02:29,658
For example, anything less than 16 hours may be considered small in your group.

46
00:02:29,658 --> 00:02:33,708
Application subject matter experts, also known as SMEs.

47
00:02:33,708 --> 00:02:37,939
Many times your issues may be simply handled by an SME or

48
00:02:37,939 --> 00:02:40,648
a domain expert by talking or walking the customer

49
00:02:40,648 --> 00:02:42,638
through the issue to resolution.

50
00:02:42,638 --> 00:02:45,658
Off-the-shelf software installation and configuration

51
00:02:45,658 --> 00:02:48,618
for business application support.

52
00:02:48,618 --> 00:02:52,474
Many times off-the-shelf software or cloud-based software needs to be

53
00:02:52,474 --> 00:02:54,678
configured and set up to support the customers.

54
00:02:54,678 --> 00:02:58,668
And many times the operation group will perform this function.

55
00:02:58,668 --> 00:03:02,678
Now let's look at a few more examples in the next slide.

56
00:03:02,678 --> 00:03:05,668
These examples are generally internal-facing,

57
00:03:05,668 --> 00:03:07,658
still things you are doing for the customer,

58
00:03:07,658 --> 00:03:08,698
but indirectly.

59
00:03:08,698 --> 00:03:12,688
Integration with business partners, customers, and other entities.

60
00:03:12,688 --> 00:03:17,688
For example, FTP, EDI, eCommerce connections for ordering,

61
00:03:17,688 --> 00:03:21,651
copying data between servers, setting up API endpoints,

62
00:03:21,651 --> 00:03:22,638
et cetera.

63
00:03:22,638 --> 00:03:25,688
Every company has business partners either on the supply chain side

64
00:03:25,688 --> 00:03:28,668
or the customer side to work with electronically.

65
00:03:28,668 --> 00:03:30,668
Job scheduling and management.

66
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:33,678
To ensure that all required jobs run according to schedule

67
00:03:33,678 --> 00:03:36,628
on all platforms for all applications.

68
00:03:36,628 --> 00:03:39,638
Remember, not everything runs through a user interface.

69
00:03:39,638 --> 00:03:42,678
Actively monitoring applications, triggering alerts,

70
00:03:42,678 --> 00:03:44,678
and generating automated tickets,

71
00:03:44,678 --> 00:03:48,638
and then informing key operations people of an issue.

72
00:03:48,638 --> 00:03:51,397
The last thing you want is the CEO calling you at

73
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:52,708
home because the system is down.

74
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:55,688
You want to know first, not last.

75
00:03:55,688 --> 00:03:57,678
System logging and tracking.

76
00:03:57,678 --> 00:04:01,698
Apps needs to constantly log and track their activity at all times.

77
00:04:01,698 --> 00:04:03,698
So in the event an issue happens,

78
00:04:03,698 --> 00:04:07,678
it is easy to review the log and help pinpoint an issue.

79
00:04:07,678 --> 00:04:09,668
It's like leaving bread crumbs.

80
00:04:09,668 --> 00:04:11,618
Database maintenance.

81
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:14,460
Applications and users maintain the database from a

82
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,678
database integrity viewpoint.

83
00:04:15,678 --> 00:04:18,648
In other words, they know their data and its business meaning,

84
00:04:18,648 --> 00:04:23,658
whereas operations maintains it from an efficiency and processing viewpoint,

85
00:04:23,658 --> 00:04:25,708
cleaning up deleted records, re-indexing,

86
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:29,168
creating new indexes and views, backing up data,

87
00:04:29,168 --> 00:04:30,648
things like that.

88
00:04:30,648 --> 00:04:31,658
Data movement,

89
00:04:31,658 --> 00:04:35,338
like file transfers and moving transactional data to a data warehouse,

90
00:04:35,338 --> 00:04:35,698
for example.

91
00:04:35,698 --> 00:04:41,618
So we have covered a plethora of operational topics related to applications.

92
00:04:41,618 --> 00:04:43,678
Again, these should all be part of your business,

93
00:04:43,678 --> 00:04:48,628
whether partially staffed by your development team or a separate ops team,

94
00:04:48,628 --> 00:04:50,628
or some other combination of both.

95
00:04:50,628 --> 00:04:52,648
And this list is not comprehensive.

96
00:04:52,648 --> 00:04:55,161
You need to come up with the list that best suits

97
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:56,668
the needs of your organization.

98
00:04:56,668 --> 00:05:06,000
Now, let's talk about a great technique to use to support operational tasks, tickets, in the next section.
