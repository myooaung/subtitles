1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,160
Operations Backlog and Tickets.

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:04,140
In this section,

3
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:11,180
we will discuss how we transform a ticket into a fully-formed backlog item.

4
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:15,180
Let's define in general what an operations backlog means.

5
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:19,120
It's a prioritized list containing short descriptions

6
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:23,160
and other information about the issue, functionality or requirements,

7
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,110
desired in the product or system.

8
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:28,200
For each backlog item, that is ticket,

9
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:32,200
you want to capture key attributes that'll help you make good decisions.

10
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,150
This is very important.

11
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:37,150
I'll have a few attributes for you to get you started,

12
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:41,120
but is very important to choose attributes wisely.

13
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,170
They will help you save loads of time and money.

14
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:46,200
So before we talk about those key attributes,

15
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:52,190
let's review the assessment process, a little more detail.

16
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:58,170
Here is an approach, a process to performing normal ticket assessment.

17
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:00,180
Assess Backlog Item.

18
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:04,200
So you or someone else or a small team will review each item.

19
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:08,140
The assessor owns the backlog item.

20
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:10,170
Never have a ticket unowned.

21
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:14,140
So until it is assigned or reassigned to someone else,

22
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:17,190
it is owned by the person doing the assessment of the ticket.

23
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:22,160
Next, provide feedback to the ticket creator or the initiator of the ticket,

24
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:25,180
for example, by sending a confirmation email,

25
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:27,180
or a Slack message, for example,

26
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:31,596
or the ticketing system itself will have a feedback loop to the requester,

27
00:01:31,596 --> 00:01:32,190
I'm sure.

28
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:37,140
You want to inform the requester that the ticket is under review,

29
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,180
and please reply within a reasonable timeframe.

30
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,170
People don't like to wait.

31
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:43,120
"Gee, I wonder what happened to my ticket.

32
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:43,945
"Are they looking at it?

33
00:01:43,945 --> 00:01:46,170
" You want good, quick customer service.

34
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:49,170
Next, you will analyze the request.

35
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:52,160
Ask the requester questions, get clarifications,

36
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:55,170
or ask other Subject-Matter Experts for inputs.

37
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:59,140
Spend only about an hour or two at most per item or ticket.

38
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:02,200
Do not solve, only assess.

39
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,200
You don't want to spend all day doing solution solving.

40
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,594
You have lots to do with assessing and keeping the

41
00:02:08,594 --> 00:02:11,140
tickets moving forward into the backlog.

42
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:13,170
Maybe some tickets are literally, five minutes,

43
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:16,150
five seconds, but never more than one or two hours,

44
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:18,160
or if it's more than that,

45
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,700
then you add to the ticket that the assessment will take an additional,

46
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:27,150
say, four hours or eight hours to do the proper analysis.

47
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:32,140
Next, update attributes of the backlog item or the ticket item.

48
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:36,130
Now each item will have attributes or information of value

49
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:39,170
which we will go into detail in the next slide.

50
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:44,150
Ticket is now ready for grooming, that is it's in your backlog,

51
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:46,160
it's ready to be looked at and groomed,

52
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,120
and we're going to talk about grooming more in the next section as well.

53
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:55,299
But now let's talk about those attributes or fields of information that are

54
00:02:55,299 --> 00:03:02,150
very important to be attached to the backlog item or ticket.

55
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:05,820
The purpose of collecting information is to help you and your

56
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:08,200
team make good decisions regarding your demand.

57
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:12,110
You can't make good decisions without good data.

58
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:15,421
So you need to decide what are the minimum fields you need

59
00:03:15,421 --> 00:03:18,130
filled out to be able to make good decisions.

60
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:21,160
Timeliness in analyzing the request is important.

61
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:25,170
If you take too long, you are likely not to meet the customer's needs.

62
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:29,170
Also, who is responsible for doing it, doing the analysis?

63
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:32,880
You need someone to be relatively savvy about the business and

64
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:36,190
the systems in order to perform the data fulfillment activity

65
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:39,120
and prepare the ticket for grooming.

66
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,889
The person doing the initial assessment may not be the person doing the

67
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:45,170
analysis and gathering the important data element.

68
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:50,110
It certainly could be, but doesn't have to, and lastly, urgency.

69
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:53,140
Most tickets may be changes to an existing system,

70
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:56,140
like I need a new ID, add a new field to the report,

71
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:58,180
or things that I have been calling normal tickets,

72
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:02,160
but at times that normal ticket might be extremely important,

73
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:07,110
or even politically important, that needs immediate disposition,

74
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:11,120
maybe not a production issue, but needs to be handled very quickly.

75
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,137
Once I worked in a ticketing system that had a checkbox for VIP,

76
00:04:15,137 --> 00:04:17,180
very important person, and the name of that person,

77
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:20,200
and if you check VIP, it went to the top of the queue,

78
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,130
quite interesting.

79
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:23,120
All right.

80
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,140
So let's go over the list of attributes that I think are important.

81
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:30,180
So what do you think they should be?

82
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:35,150
Here is an example list of attributes that might work for you as a starter list.

83
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:37,672
Ultimately the list of attributes is what you and your team

84
00:04:37,672 --> 00:04:40,180
needs to do the job and it's up to you.

85
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:44,150
Now I have two columns here: the attribute and an example.

86
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:47,170
The first, item number or ID, and it should be unique.

87
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:49,200
It's just an easy way to do a reference, certainly.

88
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,150
Next, a short description of the item.

89
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:56,130
Ensure it's easy-to-read and easy to understand its intent,

90
00:04:56,130 --> 00:05:00,130
in this case, modify the home page to reflect the five new products.

91
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:04,150
Category, such as maybe operations, could be an activity,

92
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:09,200
a project, just some sort of way to categorize this particular demand item.

93
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,140
You may want to filter later, like,

94
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:14,110
well show me all the items that have to do with operations,

95
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:16,200
or show me all the items that has to do something else.

96
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,150
So a category bucket is quite handy.

97
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:25,120
Next, system reference, maybe there is a system or application name or a tag,

98
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,190
maybe it's the corporate website or something like that,

99
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:30,200
then level of effort or LOE.

100
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:33,962
It could be something chunky like just use small,

101
00:05:33,962 --> 00:05:37,120
medium, large, similar to the scrum style,

102
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,120
or it could be number of hours like 40 hours.

103
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,486
Maybe the small medium large might be something

104
00:05:42,486 --> 00:05:46,620
like less than 25 hours is small, 25 to 50,

105
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:51,140
medium, 50 to 100, large, anything over 100 is really large.

106
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:53,624
Maybe just have some sort of yardstick like that that

107
00:05:53,624 --> 00:05:56,736
helps your team quickly go small, medium,

108
00:05:56,736 --> 00:05:57,180
large.

109
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:59,150
Next, due date.

110
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,180
There's always going to be a due date.

111
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,180
When do they want it?

112
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:04,130
Many times, it might just be right now.

113
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:05,200
Next, blocker.

114
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:09,140
What items are blocking or impeding this item?

115
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:10,190
Here's a quick definition.

116
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:13,200
A blocker is something that is blocking or impeding your work.

117
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,130
It's in the way of moving forward.

118
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:19,120
In other words, there's no way you could do this ticket,

119
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,120
that is this backlog item, unless the blocker is removed.

120
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,110
For example,

121
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:28,150
you need to meet with Joe who's a subject-matter expert and he's out of town,

122
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:29,190
so we have to wait.

123
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:31,180
Next, risk.

124
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:36,180
What risks might there be, such as we may lose revenue if we don't do this.

125
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,160
Again,

126
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,878
a risk is defined as something that might happen in

127
00:06:39,878 --> 00:06:42,150
the future to affect the item.

128
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:44,160
So you need to consider risk as well.

129
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,120
Next is sponsor.

130
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:49,110
Now a sponsor could be the actual ticket requester,

131
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:53,110
but what I really mean by this is is this requester,

132
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:56,346
underneath a particular senior manager or vice president,

133
00:06:56,346 --> 00:06:57,150
for example.

134
00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:02,130
I want to know where in the organization this ticket is coming from.

135
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:04,130
This could be very, very important.

136
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:07,170
Maybe the company right now has issues with manufacturing,

137
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:09,200
and therefore, any ticket that comes through,

138
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,200
maybe the VP of Manufacturing,

139
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:15,728
I might want to move up higher on the list to get done because I

140
00:07:15,728 --> 00:07:18,453
know the business is really having trouble now manufacturing

141
00:07:18,453 --> 00:07:21,120
certain items and getting them out the door.

142
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,190
All right, the next is urgency or impact.

143
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:27,374
Urgency values may be things like high, medium,

144
00:07:27,374 --> 00:07:32,140
or low, and the impact is maybe the broadness of the issue.

145
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:35,190
It might be very urgent, but affect two people.

146
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:39,150
It may not be that urgent, but affects 2, 000 people.

147
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:44,180
So something less urgent, but affecting more people may drive a higher priority.

148
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:47,140
Next, business domain.

149
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:50,543
For example, is it manufacturing, engineering,

150
00:07:50,543 --> 00:07:51,190
sales, things like that,

151
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:54,190
and may want to know where in the business does this fit.

152
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:56,170
Of course, technical domain.

153
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:57,180
Is this a.

154
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:03,120
NET thing, a Java thing, e-commerce, maybe SAP, Oracle, or other platforms.

155
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,517
It may be great to just know what that technology is because

156
00:08:05,517 --> 00:08:08,987
it may help you make the particular assignments or assign

157
00:08:08,987 --> 00:08:11,130
the right resources later on.

158
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:13,140
Lastly in my example is priority.

159
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:18,130
I like to assign numbers, like one, or two, or three, and they are unique.

160
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:20,120
I never use the same number twice.

161
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:24,180
I don't have five number ones because that's just plain impossible and silly.

162
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:29,150
So priority is a category that identifies the relative importance of this

163
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:32,934
particular issue or problem or change and the priority all of times is

164
00:08:32,934 --> 00:08:36,167
going to be based on the impact and urgency,

165
00:08:36,167 --> 00:08:39,180
in particular, maybe even some of the other attributes I mentioned.

166
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:44,130
So I do use impact and urgency to help me assign the particular priority.

167
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:47,185
Now notice the attributes are all about collecting information to

168
00:08:47,185 --> 00:08:52,865
provide you data you need to prioritize and assign resources and to

169
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:56,130
decide if or when to start the particular work.

170
00:08:56,130 --> 00:09:00,170
None of the attributes have to do with the actually working the ticket item.

171
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:04,170
That'll come later after it's been approved and is being worked.

172
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:05,170
When it's being worked,

173
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:10,000
then additional attributes could be filled out in terms of its progress.

174
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Okay, now let's move on to grooming and con-bon for operations in the next section.
