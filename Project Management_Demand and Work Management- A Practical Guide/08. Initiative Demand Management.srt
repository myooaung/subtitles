1
00:00:01,367 --> 00:00:02,447
Initiative Demand Management.

2
00:00:02,447 --> 00:00:06,111
This section contains my recommendations of the basics you need

3
00:00:06,111 --> 00:00:08,437
for setting up your initiative demand process.

4
00:00:08,437 --> 00:00:11,921
Think of this as a starter kit or approach for you and

5
00:00:11,921 --> 00:00:14,367
your team and modify it as you see fit.

6
00:00:14,367 --> 00:00:17,397
Remember, no one process can be applied to every situation.

7
00:00:17,397 --> 00:00:19,447
Now we are on the other side of the spectrum.

8
00:00:19,447 --> 00:00:22,407
This is the big, chunky, and quite frankly,

9
00:00:22,407 --> 00:00:27,219
the area where you can make and save the most money for your company or

10
00:00:27,219 --> 00:00:32,367
organization and have by far the greatest impact to the business,

11
00:00:32,367 --> 00:00:36,397
the employees and the customers.

12
00:00:36,397 --> 00:00:41,397
What do you think is the current perception of IT by the business?

13
00:00:41,397 --> 00:00:42,397
Well, let's see.

14
00:00:42,397 --> 00:00:47,407
13% of business executives view IT as a business leader.

15
00:00:47,407 --> 00:00:50,397
Wow, only 13%.

16
00:00:50,397 --> 00:00:56,437
87% of (chuckles) business executives do not view IT as business leaders.

17
00:00:56,437 --> 00:00:58,437
I think that is appalling.

18
00:00:58,437 --> 00:01:00,397
Why do you think that is?

19
00:01:00,397 --> 00:01:04,397
How can you be a strategic IT business leader yourself

20
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:06,407
and create and drive initiatives?

21
00:01:06,407 --> 00:01:08,407
This module will help you get there.

22
00:01:08,407 --> 00:01:14,437
Now let's see how you can overcome and change that perception.

23
00:01:14,437 --> 00:01:18,581
How to overcome the perception that only 13% of business

24
00:01:18,581 --> 00:01:21,437
executives view IT as a business leader.

25
00:01:21,437 --> 00:01:23,417
So here are a few things you need to do.

26
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:26,407
Align your demand with business initiatives.

27
00:01:26,407 --> 00:01:30,234
Make sure your demand is always in alignment with the

28
00:01:30,234 --> 00:01:32,377
business strategies of the company.

29
00:01:32,377 --> 00:01:34,387
Next, you want to add value to the business.

30
00:01:34,387 --> 00:01:36,367
Don't just do cool, techie stuff.

31
00:01:36,367 --> 00:01:38,377
Be sure it helps the business.

32
00:01:38,377 --> 00:01:42,417
Next, increase revenue, avoid costs, improve service.

33
00:01:42,417 --> 00:01:47,377
This trilogy should be memorized and used to help you prioritize your demand,

34
00:01:47,377 --> 00:01:51,387
not just in initiatives, but actually in operations and projects as well.

35
00:01:51,387 --> 00:01:54,437
Become a business leader and not just a technology leader.

36
00:01:54,437 --> 00:01:55,427
Do both.

37
00:01:55,427 --> 00:01:56,427
This can be tough.

38
00:01:56,427 --> 00:02:00,417
Some people need to improve their leadership and communication skills first,

39
00:02:00,417 --> 00:02:02,387
and there'll be more on that later.

40
00:02:02,387 --> 00:02:04,407
And now you can start by understanding,

41
00:02:04,407 --> 00:02:08,367
embracing and implementing what I'm about to say in this module.

42
00:02:08,367 --> 00:02:14,377
Okay, let's first recap the definition of an initiative.

43
00:02:14,377 --> 00:02:16,407
Let's define business initiative.

44
00:02:16,407 --> 00:02:19,590
Initiatives are the means through which a strategic

45
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:22,447
vision is translated into practice.

46
00:02:22,447 --> 00:02:27,407
A vision is a realistic and credible future state for an organization.

47
00:02:27,407 --> 00:02:31,916
Initiatives drive activities you're going to do in order to

48
00:02:31,916 --> 00:02:34,397
achieve the organization's strategic vision.

49
00:02:34,397 --> 00:02:38,397
A business initiative is an organization's way of setting a priority.

50
00:02:38,397 --> 00:02:42,031
It is usually a description of the direction the organization wants to

51
00:02:42,031 --> 00:02:45,397
take and how that will improve the organization.

52
00:02:45,397 --> 00:02:47,937
The initiative is usually a component of the

53
00:02:47,937 --> 00:02:50,437
organization's vision for the future.

54
00:02:50,437 --> 00:02:55,387
Now let's dig a little deeper in the next slide.

55
00:02:55,387 --> 00:02:57,920
Initiatives are a means through which a strategic

56
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,437
vision is translated into practice.

57
00:03:00,437 --> 00:03:04,983
Strategic initiatives are collections of finite duration discretionary

58
00:03:04,983 --> 00:03:09,902
projects and programs outside of the organization's day-to-day

59
00:03:09,902 --> 00:03:14,427
operational activities and these are designed to help the organization

60
00:03:14,427 --> 00:03:18,397
achieve its targeted business goal or goals.

61
00:03:18,397 --> 00:03:22,357
Now let's look at some examples.

62
00:03:22,357 --> 00:03:27,397
Here are some examples of strategic initiatives: Increase revenue by 15%.

63
00:03:27,397 --> 00:03:30,357
Build a new, cost-efficient aircraft.

64
00:03:30,357 --> 00:03:34,397
Implement a new CAD, computer-aided design, engineering system.

65
00:03:34,397 --> 00:03:38,447
Now increasing revenue by 15% may have been driven by the sales organization,

66
00:03:38,447 --> 00:03:42,268
building a new cost-efficient aircraft may have been driven by

67
00:03:42,268 --> 00:03:44,447
the engineering or manufacturing organization,

68
00:03:44,447 --> 00:03:47,447
and lastly, implement a new CAD, computer-aided design,

69
00:03:47,447 --> 00:03:51,407
system may have been driven by the IT organization.

70
00:03:51,407 --> 00:03:54,920
Now all of these initiatives are likely to drive a lot

71
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,407
of demand and a lot of work into IT.

72
00:03:57,407 --> 00:03:58,427
So be ready.

73
00:03:58,427 --> 00:04:05,000
Now in the next section, we will look at demand sources and the portfolio management organization.
