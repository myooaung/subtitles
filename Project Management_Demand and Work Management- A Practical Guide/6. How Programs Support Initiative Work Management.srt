1
00:00:00,591 --> 00:00:02,631
Now let's look at the construct of a program.

2
00:00:02,631 --> 00:00:09,641
Again it is just another organizational container, but has several advantages.

3
00:00:09,641 --> 00:00:12,551
Why are programs important?

4
00:00:12,551 --> 00:00:16,586
Programs exist in order to focus resources that will enable

5
00:00:16,586 --> 00:00:18,631
broader business benefits and objectives.

6
00:00:18,631 --> 00:00:20,591
Programs have a broader reach,

7
00:00:20,591 --> 00:00:24,601
therefore a much broader impact than a project on the business,

8
00:00:24,601 --> 00:00:28,967
and therefore that is why I am emphasizing that more high-level business

9
00:00:28,967 --> 00:00:32,631
benefits can be realized by employing the notion of a program.

10
00:00:32,631 --> 00:00:37,591
Now here is a more formal definition of programs.

11
00:00:37,591 --> 00:00:38,034
Programs,

12
00:00:38,034 --> 00:00:42,715
a program is a group of related projects and operations

13
00:00:42,715 --> 00:00:47,175
managed in a coordinated manner to obtain benefits not

14
00:00:47,175 --> 00:00:49,611
available for managing them individually.

15
00:00:49,611 --> 00:00:52,571
Program management is the application of knowledge,

16
00:00:52,571 --> 00:00:56,611
skills tools and techniques to meet program requirements.

17
00:00:56,611 --> 00:00:59,611
Organizations with mature program management,

18
00:00:59,611 --> 00:01:02,601
I believe are more successful than those without it.

19
00:01:02,601 --> 00:01:04,631
Now let's revisit some key points.

20
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:08,631
A program is a collection of projects and operations.

21
00:01:08,631 --> 00:01:13,076
Typically the collection contains those projects or operations of a

22
00:01:13,076 --> 00:01:17,282
similar type or kind or possibly having the same business objective and

23
00:01:17,282 --> 00:01:20,621
goal and there also to enable synergistic benefits.

24
00:01:20,621 --> 00:01:23,508
Such as increase in revenue or avoid costs,

25
00:01:23,508 --> 00:01:27,145
things like that and lastly more benefits can be

26
00:01:27,145 --> 00:01:28,641
derived from managing them collectively.

27
00:01:28,641 --> 00:01:33,631
That is the projects and operations, rather than managing them individually.

28
00:01:33,631 --> 00:01:36,971
Now where possible there are significant advantages to

29
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:40,614
defining a program in support of an objective and then

30
00:01:40,614 --> 00:01:42,621
subdividing into component projects.

31
00:01:42,621 --> 00:01:46,621
Instead of embarking on individual projects on their own.

32
00:01:46,621 --> 00:01:50,093
This strengthens the alignment to the organizational

33
00:01:50,093 --> 00:01:55,314
strategy and ensures better control and focus in realizing

34
00:01:55,314 --> 00:01:59,571
those intended and expected benefits.

35
00:01:59,571 --> 00:02:01,641
Because projects can have a significant impact,

36
00:02:01,641 --> 00:02:05,621
positive or negative, on other projects and operations,

37
00:02:05,621 --> 00:02:10,321
the construct of a program as a container to better manage

38
00:02:10,321 --> 00:02:12,561
those interrelationships was created.

39
00:02:12,561 --> 00:02:14,601
It is a simple and great idea.

40
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:18,641
Now let's look at the attributes of a program.

41
00:02:18,641 --> 00:02:21,973
Here are the characteristics or attributes of a program which

42
00:02:21,973 --> 00:02:24,631
by the way are similar to an initiative.

43
00:02:24,631 --> 00:02:28,074
Which makes sense since we have learned that programs can be

44
00:02:28,074 --> 00:02:31,561
employed to drive and execute initiatives quite well.

45
00:02:31,561 --> 00:02:35,816
Unlike projects programs may never end or may end only when the

46
00:02:35,816 --> 00:02:37,611
businesses requirements or strategy changes.

47
00:02:37,611 --> 00:02:40,641
Programs have a higher level of complexity than projects.

48
00:02:40,641 --> 00:02:44,071
Obviously since they will involve many projects and

49
00:02:44,071 --> 00:02:46,571
operational elements and their dependencies.

50
00:02:46,571 --> 00:02:50,561
Programs involve a broader range of senior management or stakeholders.

51
00:02:50,561 --> 00:02:52,621
If you're going to have many projects and operations,

52
00:02:52,621 --> 00:02:56,581
you will quite likely have more management and stakeholders involved.

53
00:02:56,581 --> 00:02:59,581
Programs use more resources than any project might.

54
00:02:59,581 --> 00:03:02,696
Well sure multiple projects and operations will certainly add

55
00:03:02,696 --> 00:03:05,591
up to more resources in people and money.

56
00:03:05,591 --> 00:03:11,561
Programs have more potential conflict and serious broad range business issues.

57
00:03:11,561 --> 00:03:12,581
Well, yes certainly.

58
00:03:12,581 --> 00:03:16,551
You have higher level management and much more resources to compete with,

59
00:03:16,551 --> 00:03:19,591
which may result in more potential conflict.

60
00:03:19,591 --> 00:03:21,621
Programs require much more coordination.

61
00:03:21,621 --> 00:03:26,071
To say the least, it takes an immense amount of coordination management,

62
00:03:26,071 --> 00:03:30,561
acumen, communication skills and experience to work on or run a program.

63
00:03:30,561 --> 00:03:34,561
Now a couple of those might sound a little more risky or tough,

64
00:03:34,561 --> 00:03:37,082
but the point is is you're going to get the benefits from

65
00:03:37,082 --> 00:03:41,156
focusing all those resources on the big initiatives in your

66
00:03:41,156 --> 00:03:43,611
company and you'll get more bang for the buck.

67
00:03:43,611 --> 00:03:48,591
Okay now let's look at an example in the next slide.

68
00:03:48,591 --> 00:03:51,611
In this example we have an aerospace company where one of the

69
00:03:51,611 --> 00:03:55,271
initiatives is to sell better fuel saving jets and we may have

70
00:03:55,271 --> 00:03:57,591
several programs and projects for this initiative,

71
00:03:57,591 --> 00:04:00,621
but the main program is the new wing design.

72
00:04:00,621 --> 00:04:03,641
This program is strategic to the business and we want

73
00:04:03,641 --> 00:04:06,813
to manage to control all activities, sub programs,

74
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:08,571
operations and projects,

75
00:04:08,571 --> 00:04:12,551
under one umbrella to ensure resources are used effectively.

76
00:04:12,551 --> 00:04:16,581
So a portion of this program contains, engineering operations.

77
00:04:16,581 --> 00:04:19,581
Obviously we'll be using engineering to design a new wing

78
00:04:19,581 --> 00:04:21,641
and we want to be sure that current engineering operations

79
00:04:21,641 --> 00:04:23,611
are included in this program.

80
00:04:23,611 --> 00:04:28,551
A project to upgrade the CAD, Computer Aided Design software and equipment,

81
00:04:28,551 --> 00:04:32,551
we need this highly unique and specialized platform to design our new wing.

82
00:04:32,551 --> 00:04:34,551
Therefore we have a project for that.

83
00:04:34,551 --> 00:04:37,551
Another project is to streamline the supply chain

84
00:04:37,551 --> 00:04:38,641
with more supplier integration,

85
00:04:38,641 --> 00:04:42,283
since a new wing will have new high-tech materials from new

86
00:04:42,283 --> 00:04:46,262
suppliers and I want to be sure they are integrated into our

87
00:04:46,262 --> 00:04:48,611
supply chain in the most efficient fashion,

88
00:04:48,611 --> 00:04:50,611
and really this is just a partial list.

89
00:04:50,611 --> 00:04:52,601
More components could be placed here.

90
00:04:52,601 --> 00:04:56,591
Now on the right I have highlighted the upgrade CAD project.

91
00:04:56,591 --> 00:04:58,551
It has a defined scope.

92
00:04:58,551 --> 00:05:00,561
It has a begin date of August first.

93
00:05:00,561 --> 00:05:04,591
It has an end date of October 14th, and we have a budget of two million dollars,

94
00:05:04,591 --> 00:05:08,611
and as you can see the program includes this project under its control.

95
00:05:08,611 --> 00:05:11,611
So in this example you can see the vast differences

96
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:13,611
between a program and a project.

97
00:05:13,611 --> 00:05:17,215
So the construct of a program is a container of sorts that we

98
00:05:17,215 --> 00:05:19,591
will use to group activities that are related.

99
00:05:19,591 --> 00:05:21,571
So that to keep them coordinated,

100
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:24,564
working towards a strategic outcome and in this

101
00:05:24,564 --> 00:05:26,551
case a successful new wing design.

102
00:05:26,551 --> 00:05:30,591
Now let's see how this might look organizationally.

103
00:05:30,591 --> 00:05:34,591
Now let's explore a simple example of a program structure organizationally.

104
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:37,631
So we have our initiative, sell fuel saving jets.

105
00:05:37,631 --> 00:05:39,611
So we can make a lot more money,

106
00:05:39,611 --> 00:05:42,908
and we're going to have a program to redesign the wing because we

107
00:05:42,908 --> 00:05:45,571
know that's very important to help sell more jets.

108
00:05:45,571 --> 00:05:48,591
Under that program we're going to have a program management office,

109
00:05:48,591 --> 00:05:50,621
and that's where all the action is going to happen.

110
00:05:50,621 --> 00:05:54,452
Then to the right we've included our engineering but it's the

111
00:05:54,452 --> 00:05:57,281
operational area of engineering and we may have some other

112
00:05:57,281 --> 00:05:59,611
operations that we want to put under here as well and on the

113
00:05:59,611 --> 00:06:01,571
left we're going to upgrade CAD.

114
00:06:01,571 --> 00:06:05,571
To the upgrade CAD project will be also into the program and also the

115
00:06:05,571 --> 00:06:07,621
supplier integration project will also be under the program.

116
00:06:07,621 --> 00:06:09,621
So you can see we have all these elements,

117
00:06:09,621 --> 00:06:14,621
programs and operations, all under a program management office for wing design.

118
00:06:14,621 --> 00:06:18,805
All of which are integrated and you're looking at sharing resources,

119
00:06:18,805 --> 00:06:22,204
maximizing resources and coordinating the efforts towards the

120
00:06:22,204 --> 00:06:29,000
initiative of selling more fuel saving jets. Okay, now let's summarize this module.
