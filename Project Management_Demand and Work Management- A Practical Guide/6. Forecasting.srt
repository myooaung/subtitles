00:00:01,051 --> 00:00:01,553
Forecasting,

2
00:00:01,553 --> 00:00:07,091
that's the activity of predicting or estimating a future event or trend.

3
00:00:07,091 --> 00:00:10,121
Typically, the demand for work comes to you,

4
00:00:10,121 --> 00:00:15,091
and we will talk about those sources of demand in the next section.

5
00:00:15,091 --> 00:00:18,606
Forecasting is the activity or process by which you get up

6
00:00:18,606 --> 00:00:23,051
and try and figure out what the demand might be in the future

7
00:00:23,051 --> 00:00:25,061
for your products and services.

8
00:00:25,061 --> 00:00:31,111
So, you want to predict or estimate that future workload, that future demand.

9
00:00:31,111 --> 00:00:35,743
This information is very important to help you prepare for your staffing,

10
00:00:35,743 --> 00:00:38,768
budgeting, tools, methods, outsourcing, systems,

11
00:00:38,768 --> 00:00:44,131
et cetera, as early as possible to meet the demand.

12
00:00:44,131 --> 00:00:49,111
Let's see examples of forecasting for each demand type.

13
00:00:49,111 --> 00:00:49,960
First, though,

14
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:55,414
remember we are doing forecasting to enhance your ability to forecast,

15
00:00:55,414 --> 00:01:01,101
predict, and estimate as early as possible to meet the demand that's coming.

16
00:01:01,101 --> 00:01:07,091
Okay, in the area of operations, how about 20% increase in help center calls?

17
00:01:07,091 --> 00:01:11,101
That would help you decide maybe you need to staff up more in the help center.

18
00:01:11,101 --> 00:01:12,345
In the area of projects,

19
00:01:12,345 --> 00:01:15,131
you've learned that there's eight new projects coming your way.

20
00:01:15,131 --> 00:01:17,121
Do you have enough project managers?

21
00:01:17,121 --> 00:01:20,131
Do you have enough subject matter experts to get the job done?

22
00:01:20,131 --> 00:01:23,111
That'll help you staff up and get ready.

23
00:01:23,111 --> 00:01:27,071
For initiatives, there are three new initiatives coming.

24
00:01:27,071 --> 00:01:28,061
What does that mean?

25
00:01:28,061 --> 00:01:30,101
What are the resources required for that?

26
00:01:30,101 --> 00:01:30,429
So,

27
00:01:30,429 --> 00:01:33,713
it is very important to reach out to your customer

28
00:01:33,713 --> 00:01:36,336
base in the area of initiatives, projects,

29
00:01:36,336 --> 00:01:40,131
and operations to predict and determine what is coming.

30
00:01:40,131 --> 00:01:49,000
Now, let's look at the sources of demand. In other words, where does all this work come from?
