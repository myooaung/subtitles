00:00:01.381 --> 00:00:03.381
Sprint versus kanban.

2
00:00:03.381 --> 00:00:06.561
Kanban to me is a great tool or approach for handling

3
00:00:06.561 --> 00:00:10.321
operational work tasks such as bugs, maintenance,

4
00:00:10.321 --> 00:00:12.371
smallish requirements, and things like that.

5
00:00:12.371 --> 00:00:15.291
But when is sprint a better choice?

6
00:00:15.291 --> 00:00:17.381
Well, let's find out.

7
00:00:17.381 --> 00:00:19.311
What's a sprint?

8
00:00:19.311 --> 00:00:23.361
You have likely heard of or been part of a sprint, but let's recap.

9
00:00:23.361 --> 00:00:28.331
A sprint is a term coined and used by the agile framework of scrum,

10
00:00:28.331 --> 00:00:33.291
and it is a timebox, a length of time during which a usable,

11
00:00:33.291 --> 00:00:35.462
and potentially releasable product increment,

12
00:00:35.462 --> 00:00:36.331
is created.

13
00:00:36.331 --> 00:00:40.301
And in software it would be like a new version or release.

14
00:00:40.301 --> 00:00:44.301
Now, sprints have consistent durations throughout a development effort.

15
00:00:44.301 --> 00:00:47.331
And maybe there are two, three, or four-week segments.

16
00:00:47.331 --> 00:00:51.361
A new sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the previous sprint.

17
00:00:51.361 --> 00:00:54.371
They typically end on a Friday, but they don't have to.

18
00:00:54.371 --> 00:00:58.361
But if it did end on a Friday, the next sprint starts on Monday.

19
00:00:58.361 --> 00:01:03.371
Now let's talk about a few sprint characteristics in the next slide.

20
00:01:03.371 --> 00:01:06.321
Here are a few high-level sprint characteristics.

21
00:01:06.321 --> 00:01:11.291
First, an agile iteration is equivalent to a timebox of work,

22
00:01:11.291 --> 00:01:13.739
and a sprint is an agile iteration, therefore,

23
00:01:13.739 --> 00:01:15.331
a timebox of work.

24
00:01:15.331 --> 00:01:17.301
And some of the characteristics.

25
00:01:17.301 --> 00:01:19.341
It contains a list of features to build.

26
00:01:19.341 --> 00:01:22.341
And by the way, they are chosen by the team on the sprint.

27
00:01:22.341 --> 00:01:25.291
Tasks are assigned to all team members.

28
00:01:25.291 --> 00:01:28.237
A sprint is a fixed duration of time and may range

29
00:01:28.237 --> 00:01:30.925
from one to four weeks in duration, but typically,

30
00:01:30.925 --> 00:01:32.361
I've seen two or three.

31
00:01:32.361 --> 00:01:35.361
It has a fixed start date, maybe it's May 1st.

32
00:01:35.361 --> 00:01:38.361
And it has a fixed end date, maybe it's May 22nd.

33
00:01:38.361 --> 00:01:41.311
That would be a three-week sprint.

34
00:01:41.311 --> 00:01:44.115
So it is important for you to have a basic understanding of a

35
00:01:44.115 --> 00:01:48.568
sprint so you can better relate to my next slide on comparing

36
00:01:48.568 --> 00:01:52.341
the approach of kanban to sprints.

37
00:01:52.341 --> 00:01:55.361
Sprint versus kanban, which to choose?

38
00:01:55.361 --> 00:02:00.097
Sprints and kanban are both iterative work approaches that rely

39
00:02:00.097 --> 00:02:02.361
on process flows and aim to reduce waste.

40
00:02:02.361 --> 00:02:02.663
However,

41
00:02:02.663 --> 00:02:05.381
there are a few main differences between the two

42
00:02:05.381 --> 00:02:07.371
that I'd like to point out to you.

43
00:02:07.371 --> 00:02:10.291
In the category of assigning work,

44
00:02:10.291 --> 00:02:12.361
they're both somewhat similar for this attribute.

45
00:02:12.361 --> 00:02:14.381
Sprint uses a pull system.

46
00:02:14.381 --> 00:02:14.709
However,

47
00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:18.787
an entire batch of work or use cases or multiple tasks is

48
00:02:18.787 --> 00:02:21.341
pulled for each sprint or iteration.

49
00:02:21.341 --> 00:02:22.341
Now, with kanban,

50
00:02:22.341 --> 00:02:26.763
it also uses a pull system or a systematic workflow that allows team members to

51
00:02:26.763 --> 00:02:30.371
only pull new tickets once the previous ticket is complete.

52
00:02:30.371 --> 00:02:32.331
Regarding due dates,

53
00:02:32.331 --> 00:02:35.983
deliverables for sprint are determined by the sprint

54
00:02:35.983 --> 00:02:39.351
themselves or set periods of time in which a set of work

55
00:02:39.351 --> 00:02:42.331
must be completed and ready for review.

56
00:02:42.331 --> 00:02:44.291
Whereas with kanban,

57
00:02:44.291 --> 00:02:48.859
products and processes are delivered continuously on an as needed basis with

58
00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:51.381
duties determined typically by the business or the customer.

59
00:02:51.381 --> 00:02:53.301
So, best uses.

60
00:02:53.301 --> 00:02:53.970
With sprint,

61
00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.644
it's best for teams with stable priorities that may not change

62
00:02:57.644 --> 00:03:00.311
as much over time such as with projects.

63
00:03:00.311 --> 00:03:01.641
And with kanban,

64
00:03:01.641 --> 00:03:05.361
best for varying and changing priorities such as with operations.

65
00:03:05.361 --> 00:03:05.640
Now,

66
00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:14.000
I have a few more comments about ticket queues and triage that I'd like to cover in the next section.
