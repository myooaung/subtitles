Hello everyone,

2
00:00:05.914 --> 00:00:10.431
my name is Michael Krasowski and welcome to my course Demand

3
00:00:10.431 --> 00:00:13.020
and Work Management: A Practical Guide.

4
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:16.413
Are you overwhelmed by the amount of work request you get every week,

5
00:00:16.413 --> 00:00:17.090
even everyday?

6
00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.010
Are you challenged by juggling, not only your project workload,

7
00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:23.080
but the workload of your entire team or department?

8
00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:28.070
Is every new request seemingly the next new number one item to accomplish?

9
00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.090
If so, you've come to the right place.

10
00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.000
This course is for you.

11
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.060
In this course, we're going to provide you the skills,

12
00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:36.057
approaches, tools,

13
00:00:36.057 --> 00:00:41.080
and techniques to learn and improve your demand and work management skills.

14
00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.868
Some of the major topics that we'll cover include fundamentals of

15
00:00:44.868 --> 00:00:48.060
demand management and why it is so important.

16
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.884
Constructing your demand management process to ensure you're

17
00:00:50.884 --> 00:00:53.080
doing the right work in the first place.

18
00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:58.020
Building your operations management process, including Kanban techniques.

19
00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.874
Building your project management process using traditional

20
00:01:00.874 --> 00:01:03.060
and Agile project management techniques.

21
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:08.000
And building your initiatives management process, plus portfolio management.

22
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.930
By the end of the course, you'll be able to collect,

23
00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.050
organize, analyze, track, and prioritize your demand and backlog.

24
00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.383
Furthermore, several approaches to managing the work itself will be presented,

25
00:01:19.383 --> 00:01:22.010
such as Kanban and Agile techniques.

26
00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:31.000
I hope you'll join me on this journey to improving your skills with my Pluralsight course Demand and Work management: A Practical Guide.
