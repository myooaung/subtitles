Some final words: "A goal properly set is halfway reached, " by Abraham Lincoln.

2
00:00:07.156 --> 00:00:09.653
It may seem that the material presented in this course would just

3
00:00:09.653 --> 00:00:12.349
take way too long to get going in your organization,

4
00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:17.206
but like the quote says, setting your goal would be half the challenge.

5
00:00:17.206 --> 00:00:19.176
Then I think you're home free.

6
00:00:19.176 --> 00:00:23.785
I would treat the implementation of demand and work management processes and

7
00:00:23.785 --> 00:00:28.181
tools like an IT project using agile or scrum techniques for all the things

8
00:00:28.181 --> 00:00:31.176
you need to do in your demand list and work them.

9
00:00:31.176 --> 00:00:33.216
That is, implement them in Sprints.

10
00:00:33.216 --> 00:00:37.216
Then do grooming, grab a few more items, and move forward.

11
00:00:37.216 --> 00:00:40.166
Now it may take some time to get where you want to be,

12
00:00:40.166 --> 00:00:42.186
but that is a great way to get going.

13
00:00:42.186 --> 00:00:43.461
And with the Sprint approach,

14
00:00:43.461 --> 00:00:47.978
you can do the necessary course corrections to navigate your

15
00:00:47.978 --> 00:00:51.176
organizational roadblocks and potential resistance to change.

16
00:00:51.176 --> 00:00:53.206
Believe me, you will encounter some resistance.

17
00:00:53.206 --> 00:00:58.246
Take your time, be patient, you'll make it.

18
00:00:58.246 --> 00:01:01.166
Thank you very much for taking my course.

19
00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:01.935
I, like you,

20
00:01:01.935 --> 00:01:05.654
have struggled over the years in how to handle demand and how to get

21
00:01:05.654 --> 00:01:08.226
things done in the most efficient way possible.

22
00:01:08.226 --> 00:01:11.430
I hope and trust that this course has been able to

23
00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.022
provide you with the essential tools, methods,

24
00:01:14.022 --> 00:01:14.808
approaches,

25
00:01:14.808 --> 00:01:19.246
and renewed confidence to help you and your teammates be more successful.

26
00:01:19.246 --> 00:01:28.000
Lastly, I hope to see you again in one of my other courses, and I wish you the best in your professional journey.
