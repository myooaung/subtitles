Grooming for Projects.

2
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:07.650
This section contains the definition and process of grooming to help

3
00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:11.690
you manage the demand process for your projects.

4
00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:13.670
Let's define grooming.

5
00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:19.372
It is the process of reviewing projects in the backlog to ensure

6
00:00:19.372 --> 00:00:21.690
the backlog contains the appropriate projects,

7
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:23.680
that they are prioritized,

8
00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.660
and that the projects at the top of the backlog are ready to be worked.

9
00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.630
Why is the grooming process important?

10
00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.640
Let's find out in the next slide.

11
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.680
How do you ensure you are doing the right projects?

12
00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.196
If you make a mistake of approving a ticket in the

13
00:00:42.196 --> 00:00:45.610
operational side of the house, the impact of that mistake,

14
00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.660
I would suggest to you, may be small or may have a modest impact.

15
00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.899
The impact to resources and budget are typically

16
00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:54.690
much larger on the project side.

17
00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.640
Projects can be very large, take many resources, and cost a lot of money.

18
00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.630
So as the project demand starts to pile up,

19
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:08.380
you need to have a method and approach or process in order

20
00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.613
to best decide and determine what qualifies as the best use

21
00:01:13.613 --> 00:01:15.640
of your company's resources.

22
00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.610
That is the importance of good grooming.

23
00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.524
Now let's review a simple process that you can use as a

24
00:01:22.524 --> 00:01:25.630
starting point for project grooming.

25
00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.680
Here is the summary of the project grooming process.

26
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.670
Assemble the project grooming team.

27
00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.650
Keep it the right size, just the key people.

28
00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.620
Maybe this is performed weekly to keep abreast with new request,

29
00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.630
but maybe monthly your team performs more comprehensive grooming.

30
00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.897
Review new project requests and ensure all the attributes

31
00:01:44.897 --> 00:01:46.680
and information are all filled out.

32
00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.610
You need this information to help you make good decisions.

33
00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.640
You follow the process in the previous slide,

34
00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.650
review and incorporate feedback from the projects in work,

35
00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.640
such as status reports and metrics and things like that,

36
00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.630
to help you make better decisions, and lastly,

37
00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:08.610
reprioritize your backlog, adjust resources on existing projects if necessary,

38
00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:09.011
also,

39
00:02:09.011 --> 00:02:12.620
possibly stop working projects if you need to reallocate

40
00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.610
resources to other more pressing projects.

41
00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:16.640
Now, a note on that.

42
00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.026
It is certainly easier to start and stop an operations

43
00:02:20.026 --> 00:02:22.670
ticket since there is typically less impact.

44
00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.690
To stop a project, you will need to have solid data about the project,

45
00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:33.690
its scope, goals, and outcomes in order to make a good case to stop it.

46
00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.620
I would like to make a very key point.

47
00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.600
Demand project management does not involve running the projects.

48
00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.150
That'll be on the work management side that we will

49
00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:44.680
talk about in the later modules,

50
00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:51.620
but project demand management does involve selecting which projects to execute.

51
00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.610
I would suggest strongly to you to ponder this point.

52
00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.630
Demand management may be more important than work management.

53
00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:09.000
In other words, doing the wrong work efficiently is worthless. Now let's move on to initiative demand management.
