1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:04,070
Identifying sources of demand.

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:08,410
So, how and where does all this demand, requests for your products and services,

3
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:09,160
come from?

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:13,090
Let's find out.

5
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:18,080
Let's look at the sources of demand for the demand type operations.

6
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,090
So, where is all your work coming from?

7
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:24,080
Verbal, people might just stop you in the hall,

8
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,125
go to your desk, or your manager just says,

9
00:00:27,125 --> 00:00:28,140
go do this.

10
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:29,160
Could be the phone.

11
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:34,070
People might just call you and say, this is what I want or need from you.

12
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:38,070
Email, or maybe a messaging service will ask for your help.

13
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:40,160
At least with email or a messaging service,

14
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,150
say, like Slack, you have something in writing,

15
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:45,130
much better to act on.

16
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:48,070
Next, maybe a form.

17
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:51,274
That is someone used a paper form, or electronic form,

18
00:00:51,274 --> 00:00:54,100
or system to capture and log the request,

19
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:56,130
certainly even better than email.

20
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:58,110
And, lastly, maybe it's a ticket,

21
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:02,268
that is you are using a real issue management system that has tickets,

22
00:01:02,268 --> 00:01:04,922
that is issues a request, they're captured,

23
00:01:04,922 --> 00:01:06,110
and they're tracked.

24
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:08,110
I think this is even better.

25
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:11,110
Now, all of these make up your work intake,

26
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:16,140
that is your operations demand of things people are asking or telling you to do.

27
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:22,140
So, this is the point at which the operations demand management process begins.

28
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:27,110
Now, let's check out the demand sources for projects.

29
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:31,120
Let's look at the sources of demand for the demand type projects.

30
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:34,070
So, where is all your project work coming from?

31
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:35,160
Well, it could be a management directive,

32
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,904
someone up high on the organization chart,

33
00:01:37,904 --> 00:01:40,240
or your boss, assigns you, your team,

34
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,090
or your department a project or even multiple projects.

35
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:46,120
It could also be a project request system.

36
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:50,120
Many organizations have a process to collect project requests.

37
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:54,113
So, someone fills out a few electronic forms and they get routed,

38
00:01:54,113 --> 00:01:56,120
say, to you, and then they get worked.

39
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,070
Could be tickets.

40
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:01,130
There could be some tickets that are in fact not really quick fixes,

41
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:03,909
but actually, upon further review by you,

42
00:02:03,909 --> 00:02:05,100
much more complex.

43
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:09,437
And, hence, you might decide they weren't being categorized as a project,

44
00:02:09,437 --> 00:02:12,150
and not just another operational task.

45
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:15,100
Lastly, projects come from initiatives.

46
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,140
Remember, initiatives are very large,

47
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:21,604
very strategic activities that in fact are a main

48
00:02:21,604 --> 00:02:24,120
source of driving new projects.

49
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,070
Now, all of these make up your work intake,

50
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:32,080
that is your project demand of things people are asking or telling you to do.

51
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:37,110
So, this is the point at which the project demand management process begins.

52
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:41,150
Now, let's check out the demand sources for initiatives.

53
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:46,140
Let's look at the sources of demand for the demand type initiatives.

54
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:50,080
So, where is all your work coming from for initiatives?

55
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,120
It could be from the board of directors.

56
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:56,070
You don't get much more senior than the board of directors of a corporation,

57
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:58,070
large or small for that matter.

58
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:02,140
Typically, a board is looking at very high level and broad strategies.

59
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,160
Steering groups.

60
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:06,671
Many times these are comprised of senior company

61
00:03:06,671 --> 00:03:10,090
individuals across multiple business domains,

62
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:13,160
such as manufacturing and engineering, within a company.

63
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,100
Senior executives.

64
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,539
They may band together to tackle problems and

65
00:03:17,539 --> 00:03:20,110
comprise their own list of initiatives.

66
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:21,130
Business leaders.

67
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:25,110
Maybe this group is not only leaders in a company,

68
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:28,130
but may also comprise of business leaders in the community,

69
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:33,070
or their supply chain, as two examples, all working together.

70
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:34,430
And, lastly, PMO,

71
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:37,893
which is the portfolio management office that I'll

72
00:03:37,893 --> 00:03:40,120
further define in the next slide.

73
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:44,070
Now, all of these make up your work intake for initiatives.

74
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:49,070
That is, your initiative demand of things people are asking or telling you to do.

75
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:54,070
So, this is the point at which the initiative demand management process begins.

76
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:58,304
The next module is dedicated to elaborating on the demand

77
00:03:58,304 --> 00:04:02,100
management processes for each of the three demand types.

78
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:11,000
But, before we end this module, it is important to define the term, PMO, a little further.
