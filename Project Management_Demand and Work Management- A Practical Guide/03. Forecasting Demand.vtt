00:00:01.082 --> 00:00:04.092
Forecasting Demand Yeah, you might need a crystal ball.

2
00:00:04.092 --> 00:00:06.132
Forecasting can be challenging.

3
00:00:06.132 --> 00:00:09.112
So let's discover the possibilities and opportunities.

4
00:00:09.112 --> 00:00:13.122
The point is that you don't want it to be waiting for demand to come to you,

5
00:00:13.122 --> 00:00:16.629
but reach out and talk to your customers to plan for

6
00:00:16.629 --> 00:00:20.122
demand that is coming in the future.

7
00:00:20.122 --> 00:00:23.082
Are you reacting or planning your demand?

8
00:00:23.082 --> 00:00:27.122
You are probably just like the rest of us, probably reacting more than planning.

9
00:00:27.122 --> 00:00:32.072
Now, being reactive is basically acting in response to a situation,

10
00:00:32.072 --> 00:00:35.082
rather than creating or controlling the situation.

11
00:00:35.082 --> 00:00:39.042
Now, the situation is usually unplanned, so it just happens.

12
00:00:39.042 --> 00:00:43.062
And the activity that is the demand is being pushed to you.

13
00:00:43.062 --> 00:00:46.562
Proactive is where you are creating or controlling the

14
00:00:46.562 --> 00:00:49.042
situation by causing something to happen,

15
00:00:49.042 --> 00:00:52.072
rather than responding to it after it has happened.

16
00:00:52.072 --> 00:00:56.112
The activity is planned, and you are pulling the demand to you.

17
00:00:56.112 --> 00:01:01.102
Now let's see how this applies to our work types.

18
00:01:01.102 --> 00:01:05.062
Reactive/proactive versus our work types.

19
00:01:05.062 --> 00:01:08.052
Typically, operations are very reactive,

20
00:01:08.052 --> 00:01:12.112
usually not proactive with a very heavy ticket orientation.

21
00:01:12.112 --> 00:01:17.042
Projects tend to not be very reactive but typically more proactive,

22
00:01:17.042 --> 00:01:20.042
because projects take more work that is resources.

23
00:01:20.042 --> 00:01:24.082
They usually need more lead time, hence more planning-oriented.

24
00:01:24.082 --> 00:01:28.572
Now initiatives are rarely reactive, usually very proactive,

25
00:01:28.572 --> 00:01:32.072
hence initiatives need a longer planning phase.

26
00:01:32.072 --> 00:01:34.082
Certainly, there are exceptions to these,

27
00:01:34.082 --> 00:01:37.052
but in general, this is what you might expect.

28
00:01:37.052 --> 00:01:42.092
Let's see what we can do to better prepare ourself for what's coming.

29
00:01:42.092 --> 00:01:46.102
Forecasting Demand Forecasting is certainly easier said than done,

30
00:01:46.102 --> 00:01:50.042
that business world today is so dynamic and fast-moving.

31
00:01:50.042 --> 00:01:53.072
But maybe there are a few things we can do, and you can't be shy.

32
00:01:53.072 --> 00:01:54.102
You got to get out there.

33
00:01:54.102 --> 00:01:58.072
Now these recommendations would basically apply to all of the work types.

34
00:01:58.072 --> 00:02:00.052
Demand is your friend.

35
00:02:00.052 --> 00:02:03.547
Your backlog helps you show your management what is on your

36
00:02:03.547 --> 00:02:06.092
plate in an organized and trackable method,

37
00:02:06.092 --> 00:02:07.823
not just, "Gee, I'm really busy.

38
00:02:07.823 --> 00:02:10.072
" Track all demand.

39
00:02:10.072 --> 00:02:12.358
By tracking your demand for operations, projects,

40
00:02:12.358 --> 00:02:12.949
and initiatives,

41
00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:16.745
you will have data that can be used to help plan and

42
00:02:16.745 --> 00:02:19.072
forecast what may be coming down the road.

43
00:02:19.072 --> 00:02:21.092
Use automated tool or tools.

44
00:02:21.092 --> 00:02:24.082
Be sure they are easy to use by your team,

45
00:02:24.082 --> 00:02:27.062
easy for your manager to view progress and status,

46
00:02:27.062 --> 00:02:30.233
and easy for your customers that that make sense for them to see it,

47
00:02:30.233 --> 00:02:31.122
to view as well.

48
00:02:31.122 --> 00:02:34.112
Report on historical demand.

49
00:02:34.112 --> 00:02:37.082
Historical data may help you predict the future.

50
00:02:37.082 --> 00:02:42.052
Prepare a six, 12, or 18 month average backlog.

51
00:02:42.052 --> 00:02:42.339
Remember,

52
00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:45.067
we've talked about the key attributes we gather for

53
00:02:45.067 --> 00:02:47.308
each backlog item for operations, projects,

54
00:02:47.308 --> 00:02:48.132
and initiatives.

55
00:02:48.132 --> 00:02:53.276
Based on that data, we could average total backlog by month and hours,

56
00:02:53.276 --> 00:02:56.607
and use this as a baseline for future budgets,

57
00:02:56.607 --> 00:02:58.132
resources, and projections.

58
00:02:58.132 --> 00:03:04.122
Forecast future backlog by using the historical data plus any new business data

59
00:03:04.122 --> 00:03:08.092
such as the company is adding 10% more orders per quarter.

60
00:03:08.092 --> 00:03:11.122
You could make a rough forecast of what you may need in the future.

61
00:03:11.122 --> 00:03:14.072
By using the backlog and their estimates,

62
00:03:14.072 --> 00:03:18.052
you could propose a business case to secure more resources.

63
00:03:18.052 --> 00:03:25.000
And without tracking, you absolutely cannot do this in a methodical, organized way.
