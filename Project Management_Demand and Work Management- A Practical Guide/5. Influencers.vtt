00:00:01.162 --> 00:00:01.835
Influencers,

2
00:00:01.835 --> 00:00:07.842
these are individuals or groups who have the power to affect

3
00:00:07.842 --> 00:00:10.802
decisions of others because of their authority,

4
00:00:10.802 --> 00:00:14.162
knowledge, position, or relationship.

5
00:00:14.162 --> 00:00:14.316
Now,

6
00:00:14.316 --> 00:00:17.578
let's look at each demand type and what kinds of

7
00:00:17.578 --> 00:00:22.172
influencers are typically associated with each.

8
00:00:22.172 --> 00:00:25.232
Let's look at influencers for each demand type.

9
00:00:25.232 --> 00:00:31.242
For operations, influencers may be your manager, end users, developers.

10
00:00:31.242 --> 00:00:36.162
For projects, influencers may be middle management,

11
00:00:36.162 --> 00:00:39.162
business focal points, IT management.

12
00:00:39.162 --> 00:00:43.252
For initiatives, influencers may be board of directors,

13
00:00:43.252 --> 00:00:46.252
executives, steering groups.

14
00:00:46.252 --> 00:00:46.572
Now,

15
00:00:46.572 --> 00:00:49.376
you may have noticed that the people with the

16
00:00:49.376 --> 00:00:51.182
greater influence are on the right.

17
00:00:51.182 --> 00:00:54.212
And, as you move to the left, first to projects,

18
00:00:54.212 --> 00:00:55.712
and then to operations,

19
00:00:55.712 --> 00:00:59.093
the people most associated with that demand type typically

20
00:00:59.093 --> 00:01:02.182
have less influence in an organization.

21
00:01:02.182 --> 00:01:05.822
Yes, this is a generality, and there are exceptions,

22
00:01:05.822 --> 00:01:10.172
certainly, but initiatives are usually driven by senior executives,

23
00:01:10.172 --> 00:01:14.172
projects by more mid-level management and subject matter experts,

24
00:01:14.172 --> 00:01:18.212
and operations by end users and line management.

25
00:01:18.212 --> 00:01:21.222
So, it goes from the right, with greater influence,

26
00:01:21.222 --> 00:01:22.902
down to the left,

27
00:01:22.902 --> 00:01:28.182
with less influence in terms of the overall influence to that organization.

28
00:01:28.182 --> 00:01:30.252
Now, demand isn't just someone coming to you.

29
00:01:30.252 --> 00:01:33.232
Demand management includes you trying to figure out

30
00:01:33.232 --> 00:01:42.000
what the demand may be in the future. So, let's look at the notion of forecasting.
