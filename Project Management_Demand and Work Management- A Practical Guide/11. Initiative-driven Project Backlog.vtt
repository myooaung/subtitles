00:00:00.425 --> 00:00:03.405
Initiative-driven Project Backlog.

2
00:00:03.405 --> 00:00:05.435
To me, the most critical, important,

3
00:00:05.435 --> 00:00:08.405
and strategic projects should be initiative-driven.

4
00:00:08.405 --> 00:00:09.395
Sure,

5
00:00:09.395 --> 00:00:12.085
there'll be projects coming from operations or other parts of the

6
00:00:12.085 --> 00:00:14.445
organization based on your demand resource thresholds,

7
00:00:14.445 --> 00:00:18.445
but this is where the most high-value projects should likely originate,

8
00:00:18.445 --> 00:00:22.455
high value and low risk.

9
00:00:22.455 --> 00:00:25.405
Initiatives drive projects.

10
00:00:25.405 --> 00:00:28.395
An initiative is what we want to achieve,

11
00:00:28.395 --> 00:00:30.405
like grow revenue by 15%,

12
00:00:30.405 --> 00:00:35.395
and the projects are the engines on how we are going to get there.

13
00:00:35.395 --> 00:00:38.415
Let's explore further.

14
00:00:38.415 --> 00:00:42.405
Let's talk about the relationship between all of these backlogs for a moment.

15
00:00:42.405 --> 00:00:45.223
We have the initiatives backlog and basically just one

16
00:00:45.223 --> 00:00:49.203
backlog in the company since it is linked right up with the

17
00:00:49.203 --> 00:00:50.445
CEO or the Board of Directors.

18
00:00:50.445 --> 00:00:54.455
We have our operations and project backlogs, many of them.

19
00:00:54.455 --> 00:00:58.435
So the initiatives backlog should include,

20
00:00:58.435 --> 00:01:04.405
and consider, and integrate, and drive all of the other backlogs.

21
00:01:04.405 --> 00:01:08.435
There should not be any disconnect here in a well-run and healthy company.

22
00:01:08.435 --> 00:01:13.375
If there is a disconnect, then resources may not be optimally allocated.

23
00:01:13.375 --> 00:01:16.946
People may not be sure of why or what they're working on and the

24
00:01:16.946 --> 00:01:19.425
direction of the company may be fuzzy or confusing,

25
00:01:19.425 --> 00:01:23.465
and a host of other problems may arise as well.

26
00:01:23.465 --> 00:01:27.445
Here is a technique to help you groom your project candidates.

27
00:01:27.445 --> 00:01:29.405
We're going to come up with a grid.

28
00:01:29.405 --> 00:01:33.603
The scale on the left is going to be business value and the scale on the bottom

29
00:01:33.603 --> 00:01:38.385
is going to be our ability in IT to execute successfully.

30
00:01:38.385 --> 00:01:41.435
So the business value is low to high, as the arrow shows,

31
00:01:41.435 --> 00:01:47.415
and for our risk or our ability to execute successfully or not is left to right.

32
00:01:47.415 --> 00:01:52.445
Now these dots represent our placement of potential project candidates.

33
00:01:52.445 --> 00:01:57.072
Each dot represents a project and where it sits was based on

34
00:01:57.072 --> 00:02:00.425
discussions with the team on its business value or our

35
00:02:00.425 --> 00:02:02.405
ability to execute successfully.

36
00:02:02.405 --> 00:02:07.425
So on the lower-left quadrant, they are four projects of low value and high risk.

37
00:02:07.425 --> 00:02:09.445
We would likely exclude to do those.

38
00:02:09.445 --> 00:02:13.445
Up in the upper-left quadrant, we have high value and high risk.

39
00:02:13.445 --> 00:02:16.445
We may revisit or exclude those, not sure yet,

40
00:02:16.445 --> 00:02:19.923
and then the quadrant on the right is low value and low risk,

41
00:02:19.923 --> 00:02:24.385
and again, we may revisit or exclude those particular four projects,

42
00:02:24.385 --> 00:02:28.425
but the real target we're looking for of course is high value and low risk,

43
00:02:28.425 --> 00:02:30.385
project approved.

44
00:02:30.385 --> 00:02:33.445
So we have four projects that we want to move forward with right away.

45
00:02:33.445 --> 00:02:37.920
Now we may want to further look at the yellow-box quadrants: high value,

46
00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.445
high risk, or low-value, low risk.

47
00:02:40.445 --> 00:02:43.425
I would suggest next might be high value, high risk.

48
00:02:43.425 --> 00:02:44.455
I like the high value.

49
00:02:44.455 --> 00:02:47.435
I don't like the high risk, so we may want to revisit that.

50
00:02:47.435 --> 00:02:50.435
Maybe we want to do more analysis, dig in a little deeper,

51
00:02:50.435 --> 00:02:52.395
look back at our attributes.

52
00:02:52.395 --> 00:02:53.455
Why do we think it's high risk?

53
00:02:53.455 --> 00:02:56.395
Maybe we can do things to mitigate that risk,

54
00:02:56.395 --> 00:02:58.862
and maybe we'd find another couple projects that would

55
00:02:58.862 --> 00:03:01.425
ultimately move into the green box.

56
00:03:01.425 --> 00:03:05.814
This is a very easy approach and it's a visual approach that

57
00:03:05.814 --> 00:03:08.385
executives can easily see and understand,

58
00:03:08.385 --> 00:03:11.385
as well as your team.

59
00:03:11.385 --> 00:03:12.395
On the previous slide,

60
00:03:12.395 --> 00:03:15.023
we identified our projects that we'd like to go work on

61
00:03:15.023 --> 00:03:16.465
and kind of narrow down our backlog.

62
00:03:16.465 --> 00:03:17.465
On this slide,

63
00:03:17.465 --> 00:03:20.734
I want to give you a perspective of the backlog and the projects

64
00:03:20.734 --> 00:03:23.425
in work and how they relate to the initiatives,

65
00:03:23.425 --> 00:03:25.415
and again, I like a simple grid.

66
00:03:25.415 --> 00:03:28.385
In the first column, we have our initiative backlog,

67
00:03:28.385 --> 00:03:30.405
second column would be our project backlog,

68
00:03:30.405 --> 00:03:32.455
and the third column will be our projects in work.

69
00:03:32.455 --> 00:03:33.455
So again on the left,

70
00:03:33.455 --> 00:03:37.455
we have build a new cost-efficient aircraft as a major initiative,

71
00:03:37.455 --> 00:03:41.435
and maybe another one that's related is electronic design modernization.

72
00:03:41.435 --> 00:03:44.635
I put these together because I believe the projects may

73
00:03:44.635 --> 00:03:46.455
actually overlap and support both of those.

74
00:03:46.455 --> 00:03:48.385
So in the project backlog,

75
00:03:48.385 --> 00:03:51.455
we can see we have four projects identified that are ready to go.

76
00:03:51.455 --> 00:03:53.435
Oh, by the the way, we have two projects.

77
00:03:53.435 --> 00:03:56.405
Now each of these cards, if you will,

78
00:03:56.405 --> 00:04:00.238
each of these cards may have a whole bunch of information or limited

79
00:04:00.238 --> 00:04:03.917
information or just high-level information so the executives and team members

80
00:04:03.917 --> 00:04:07.405
can quickly glance at this and see where the projects are,

81
00:04:07.405 --> 00:04:09.435
maybe what the budget is and things like that.

82
00:04:09.435 --> 00:04:12.435
In the next row, we have a couple more initiatives.

83
00:04:12.435 --> 00:04:16.465
We have improve employee services, improve return on net assets,

84
00:04:16.465 --> 00:04:18.465
and on-demand financial management.

85
00:04:18.465 --> 00:04:21.455
These three initiatives have a lot of overlap again,

86
00:04:21.455 --> 00:04:24.455
and so we thought we would tie the projects this way.

87
00:04:24.455 --> 00:04:28.445
These three projects are actually supporting all three of those initiatives.

88
00:04:28.445 --> 00:04:32.405
Again, it could be three projects supporting just one initiative,

89
00:04:32.405 --> 00:04:34.947
but I want to show on this slide that projects typically

90
00:04:34.947 --> 00:04:37.455
overlap and support multiple initiatives.

91
00:04:37.455 --> 00:04:41.791
So we have three projects in the project backlog for this row and we have

92
00:04:41.791 --> 00:04:44.425
three projects that are actually in work for this row as well.

93
00:04:44.425 --> 00:04:49.395
So again, at a very high level, it'd be very easy to summarize your initiatives,

94
00:04:49.395 --> 00:04:52.395
summarize the projects that are ready to be worked,

95
00:04:52.395 --> 00:04:55.425
that is your backlog, and also show which projects are in work,

96
00:04:55.425 --> 00:04:58.154
and then you could drill into each one of these colored boxes if you

97
00:04:58.154 --> 00:05:03.261
will and show more status and more scope and more results of what's

98
00:05:03.261 --> 00:05:11.000
happening in each particular project. All right, in the next section, we'll talk about key roles in demand management.
