00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:03,010
Key Roles in Demand Management.

2
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:04,020
In this section,

3
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:08,000
I thought I would share with you the key roles that are essential for supporting

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,012
demand management for each of the demand types: operations,

5
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:15,050
projects, and initiatives.

6
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:18,541
Here are a few key demand management roles that would be

7
00:00:18,541 --> 00:00:21,980
required to run demand management for operations.

8
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:23,030
Manager or Leader.

9
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:27,020
This person is the process owner of the operations demand management.

10
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:29,970
They would lead, coach, and mentor the team,

11
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:32,970
and can do any of the roles, if needed.

12
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:35,714
Next should be the Queue Monitor, someone or team,

13
00:00:35,714 --> 00:00:37,960
monitoring, reviewing the queue,

14
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,020
performing the triage and keeping the tickets moving forward.

15
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:42,000
Analyst.

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
You will need one or more analysts to perform the analysis for each ticket.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,960
This role will perform more in-depth review and research if needed,

18
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,050
and the Groomer role, facilitate the daily grooming,

19
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:56,010
review items in the queue, ensure attributes are in place,

20
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:57,040
adjust priorities.

21
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:00,960
Remember, people may have one or more roles.

22
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,010
When I use the term role,

23
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:07,000
it does not necessarily represent a single person only doing that job.

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,436
Now, in a very large organization, that might be very likely,

25
00:01:10,436 --> 00:01:13,040
of course, and if I was the leader of this team,

26
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,980
I would have everyone cross-trained to be able to do any role.

27
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:21,000
Now let's take a look at project roles.

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,482
Here are a few key demand management roles that would be required

29
00:01:25,482 --> 00:01:27,780
to run demand management for projects: PMO,

30
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,970
Manager or Leader.

31
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:30,960
Here,

32
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,372
PMO stands for the Project Management Office and either the PMO or

33
00:01:34,372 --> 00:01:38,003
manager would be the process owner of the project demand

34
00:01:38,003 --> 00:01:40,319
management activities and they would lead,

35
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:44,513
coach and mentor the team, that is the manager could do any of those roles,

36
00:01:44,513 --> 00:01:45,020
if needed.

37
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:48,980
Project Manager, Project Leader, and Project Coordinator,

38
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:52,020
all roles responsible for the actual running of the projects.

39
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:55,970
Even though this role was more on the work-management side of the house,

40
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:59,173
I have placed them here since they'll be working on the processes within

41
00:01:59,173 --> 00:02:03,040
the PMO and how to execute and deliver the projects.

42
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,030
Queue Monitor,

43
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:08,010
someone or team monitoring and reviewing the queue of new projects,

44
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:11,970
performing the triage, and keeping the projects moving forward.

45
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:13,970
Business Analysts and Groomer.

46
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:17,050
You will need one or more analysts to perform the analysis for each project.

47
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:19,697
This role will perform more in-depth review and research,

48
00:02:19,697 --> 00:02:23,497
if needed, of course, and the groomer, facilitate the grooming,

49
00:02:23,497 --> 00:02:28,217
reviewing projects in the queue, ensure the attributes are in place,

50
00:02:28,217 --> 00:02:28,970
adjust priorities,

51
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:33,171
and of course review the status and outcomes of projects in work and make

52
00:02:33,171 --> 00:02:36,960
any resource or priority changes as needed as well.

53
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,960
As before, remember, people may have one or more roles.

54
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,000
So when I use the term role,

55
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,030
it does not necessarily represent a single person only doing that job.

56
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:47,970
If I was again the leader of this team,

57
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:52,960
I would have everyone as cross-trained as possible to be able to do any role.

58
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:57,970
Okay, now let's look at the initiative roles next.

59
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:02,000
Here are the initiative demand management roles: our steering group,

60
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,050
comprised of senior executive and SMEs, Subject-Matter Experts,

61
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:09,980
which will be the governance of the demand initiative process.

62
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:15,000
Senior business architects and analysts that really know the business.

63
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,960
These people will help with the business cases,

64
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:22,030
perform return on investment, do high-level planning and business architecture,

65
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:27,030
and of course, portfolio program and project managers and support teams.

66
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:30,980
These will be the leaders to actually run the portfolio management office,

67
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:33,040
the program management office, maybe offices,

68
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:40,000
and the project management offices as well. Now let's summarize this module in the next section.
