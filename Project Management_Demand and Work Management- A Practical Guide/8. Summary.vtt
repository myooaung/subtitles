00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:04.159
Now let's summarize this module.

2
00:00:04.159 --> 00:00:08.189
In this module, we want to be sure we are doing the work right.

3
00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.219
Remember, in the demand modules, we were ensuring we were doing the right work.

4
00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:15.239
The role of operations.

5
00:00:15.239 --> 00:00:20.179
Make it as easy as possible for your customers to maximize their productivity.

6
00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:23.179
You exist to service your customers.

7
00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:26.149
Operations work management process.

8
00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:28.199
In my opinion you must have a ticketing process,

9
00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.239
and that's the core in the way you are managing your work.

10
00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:35.229
Design it, build it, get buy-in from your team and customers,

11
00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:39.159
then use it and improve the process over time.

12
00:00:39.159 --> 00:00:40.179
Why kanban?

13
00:00:40.179 --> 00:00:42.189
Because it is just great.

14
00:00:42.189 --> 00:00:45.149
It is an easy technique, highly visible,

15
00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.189
simple to comprehend, yielding great results.

16
00:00:48.189 --> 00:00:50.209
Sprint versus kanban.

17
00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:52.169
In a nutshell with sprint,

18
00:00:52.169 --> 00:00:56.149
deliverables are determined by sprints or set periods of time.

19
00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:02.159
And with kanban, work is delivered continuously and in an as needed basis.

20
00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:04.209
The importance of quality triage.

21
00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:06.149
With quality triaging,

22
00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:10.159
your developers and QA teams will appreciate complete bug tickets,

23
00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:12.239
and the product owners will have a deeper understanding

24
00:01:12.239 --> 00:01:15.179
about the health of their system.

25
00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:17.189
Organizing operations.

26
00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.159
So which is the best way to organize your team?

27
00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.199
As I mentioned, there is no one right answer,

28
00:01:22.199 --> 00:01:25.686
but I wanted you to be aware of the numerous approaches to

29
00:01:25.686 --> 00:01:28.169
structuring your ops support organization.

30
00:01:28.169 --> 00:01:30.149
Organizational dynamics.

31
00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:32.189
Be vigilant and look for opportunities.

32
00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.189
New hires may drive new possibilities.

33
00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:35.531
Also,

34
00:01:35.531 --> 00:01:38.512
rotate people through different roles and make customer

35
00:01:38.512 --> 00:01:41.209
service an absolute requirement of your team.

36
00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:49.000
In the next module we will build your project management processes. I'll see you there.
