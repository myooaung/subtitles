00:00:00.788 --> 00:00:03.858
Now let's recap demand management.

2
00:00:03.858 --> 00:00:08.010
Demand management does not involve running operations,

3
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.818
projects, or initiatives, but it does involve selecting which operations,

4
00:00:13.818 --> 00:00:16.798
projects, or initiatives to execute.

5
00:00:16.798 --> 00:00:22.848
Demand management is selecting the right work to do.

6
00:00:22.848 --> 00:00:26.838
Whether it is for operations, projects, or initiatives,

7
00:00:26.838 --> 00:00:30.778
each will collect the demand, organize it,

8
00:00:30.778 --> 00:00:33.768
track it, and prioritize it.

9
00:00:33.768 --> 00:00:36.778
And the outcome is your organized demand,

10
00:00:36.778 --> 00:00:42.808
also called your backlog, all the work you may or could do.

11
00:00:42.808 --> 00:00:46.996
Let's recap the sources of demand for operation: verbal,

12
00:00:46.996 --> 00:00:52.838
phone, email, form, and tickets.

13
00:00:52.838 --> 00:00:57.976
Now let's recap the sources of demand for projects: Management directive,

14
00:00:57.976 --> 00:01:02.364
project request system, tickets from operations,

15
00:01:02.364 --> 00:01:05.798
and projects from initiatives.

16
00:01:05.798 --> 00:01:10.795
Now let's recap the demand sources for initiatives: the board of directors,

17
00:01:10.795 --> 00:01:20.000
steering groups, senior executives, business leaders, and the PMO, the Portfolio Management Office.
