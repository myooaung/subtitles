00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
Now let's recap project work management.

2
00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.929
Projects are the lifeblood of almost every business.

3
00:00:07.929 --> 00:00:11.909
Projects can be driven from management directives throughout an organization,

4
00:00:11.909 --> 00:00:14.949
operations drive project based on a threshold criteria.

5
00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:17.929
For example, if a ticket takes over 200 hours,

6
00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:18.969
you might want to make it a project.

7
00:00:18.969 --> 00:00:23.919
We do that to provide focus, visibility, and ensure success.

8
00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:25.909
Initiatives certainly drive projects.

9
00:00:25.909 --> 00:00:28.773
That is why it is so very critical that you have an

10
00:00:28.773 --> 00:00:32.159
excellent project management process in place and

11
00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:33.979
implement the best practices as you can,

12
00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:39.949
because it is so important to the success of your company.

13
00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:42.929
Here are the key concepts for project work management.

14
00:00:42.929 --> 00:00:47.959
We learn that 62% is the industry-wide standard for success rate of projects.

15
00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:49.969
That's barely two thirds of all projects.

16
00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:53.739
Good quality project work management will help you better

17
00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:55.979
succeed at running and completing your projects.

18
00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:59.889
The Project Management Office, another PMO.

19
00:00:59.889 --> 00:01:02.609
We explore why it is important to have a PMO to help

20
00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:03.969
manage project demand management,

21
00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:06.919
execute project following standards and metrics,

22
00:01:06.919 --> 00:01:09.909
and provide a necessary report and communication.

23
00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:12.949
We define a project as a temporary group activity

24
00:01:12.949 --> 00:01:15.267
designed to produce a unique product, service,

25
00:01:15.267 --> 00:01:15.929
or result,

26
00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:20.242
and that the purpose of the project construct is to focus

27
00:01:20.242 --> 00:01:22.889
resources and provide visibility to management.

28
00:01:22.889 --> 00:01:24.949
We learn about the role of the project manager.

29
00:01:24.949 --> 00:01:27.969
It is essential to ensure the project gets done professionally,

30
00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:31.434
and that they have the responsibility of initiation,

31
00:01:31.434 --> 00:01:33.919
planning, execution, performance, monitoring,

32
00:01:33.919 --> 00:01:36.889
and the closure of a project.

33
00:01:36.889 --> 00:01:38.929
We talked about traditional project management,

34
00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:41.956
which has five major process groups: conception,

35
00:01:41.956 --> 00:01:46.449
initiation, planning, execution, performance and monitoring,

36
00:01:46.449 --> 00:01:47.979
and lastly, closure.

37
00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:50.909
We also discuss agile project management,

38
00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.929
which is based on key agile principles and practices for delivering software.

39
00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:57.825
One of which would be that the highest priority is to

40
00:01:57.825 --> 00:02:01.599
satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery

41
00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:04.919
of variable that is usable software.

42
00:02:04.919 --> 00:02:07.939
We talked about the agile/scrum process groups,

43
00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:11.979
in contrast to those with the traditional project management process groups,

44
00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:14.959
and we learned that there are four agile process groups.

45
00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:18.969
And they are projects, iterations, releases and daily work.

46
00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:22.889
And we did a mapping of agile onto traditional.

47
00:02:22.889 --> 00:02:30.000
This helps us better understand the relationship between traditional project management and agile project management.
