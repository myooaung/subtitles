00:00:01.092 --> 00:00:04.092
Demand versus work, what's the difference?

2
00:00:04.092 --> 00:00:07.092
Let's list a few attributes of each.

3
00:00:07.092 --> 00:00:10.022
Demand or stuff to do.

4
00:00:10.022 --> 00:00:12.042
Where does this stuff come from?

5
00:00:12.042 --> 00:00:14.032
Where do I put it?

6
00:00:14.032 --> 00:00:16.052
How do I track it?

7
00:00:16.052 --> 00:00:19.032
How do I decide to work on it?

8
00:00:19.032 --> 00:00:21.042
Who will work on it?

9
00:00:21.042 --> 00:00:23.042
When do I start?

10
00:00:23.042 --> 00:00:26.052
Okay, I've started, now what?

11
00:00:26.052 --> 00:00:30.082
Next, it's the work itself, the stuff that I am doing.

12
00:00:30.082 --> 00:00:32.022
Well, it's work.

13
00:00:32.022 --> 00:00:35.022
Okay, it's work being, well, worked.

14
00:00:35.022 --> 00:00:37.042
Who is working it?

15
00:00:37.042 --> 00:00:39.002
Why?

16
00:00:39.002 --> 00:00:41.082
How are you doing about the work?

17
00:00:41.082 --> 00:00:44.052
What about new priorities?

18
00:00:44.052 --> 00:00:46.082
When will it be done?

19
00:00:46.082 --> 00:00:49.092
I have other approved work, now what?

20
00:00:49.092 --> 00:00:52.082
So you can see I have attributes on each side.

21
00:00:52.082 --> 00:00:56.032
One, the stuff to do side on the left.

22
00:00:56.032 --> 00:01:00.032
the work is coming in, I'm thinking about how to organize it and structure it,

23
00:01:00.032 --> 00:01:01.072
and what does it all mean.

24
00:01:01.072 --> 00:01:04.022
And on the right, it's stuff that I am doing.

25
00:01:04.022 --> 00:01:05.082
I am working on these things,

26
00:01:05.082 --> 00:01:07.888
but these are other questions that might come up and thoughts I may

27
00:01:07.888 --> 00:01:11.082
have while I'm working on these kinds of things.

28
00:01:11.082 --> 00:01:16.062
Now let's see why I choose to split up things in this way.

29
00:01:16.062 --> 00:01:19.012
Each is approached differently.

30
00:01:19.012 --> 00:01:22.042
So, why did I split it up this way, you may be asking.

31
00:01:22.042 --> 00:01:25.022
It is very important to understand the differences

32
00:01:25.022 --> 00:01:28.042
between managing demand and managing work.

33
00:01:28.042 --> 00:01:32.052
There are different processes and business practices for each.

34
00:01:32.052 --> 00:01:36.052
And I thought the best way to approach this course is to first focus on demand

35
00:01:36.052 --> 00:01:39.042
because that is what usually will be coming to you first,

36
00:01:39.042 --> 00:01:42.072
and secondly, focus on the work portion.

37
00:01:42.072 --> 00:01:45.012
Now, there is some overlap in their respective processes,

38
00:01:45.012 --> 00:01:54.000
certainly, and that will be addressed in later modules of this course. Okay, here are the course modules.
