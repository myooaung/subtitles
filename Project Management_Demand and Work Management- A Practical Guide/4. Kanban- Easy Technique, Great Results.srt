Kanban: Easy Technique, Great Results.

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:08,346
Kanban is a great tool or approach to handling

3
00:00:08,346 --> 00:00:11,080
operational-type work tasks such as bugs,

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,620
maintenance, smallish requirements, and things like that.

5
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,570
Let's check it out.

6
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:19,600
Here is a quick and simple technique known as kanban.

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,550
Originally from Japan.

8
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:25,540
Kanban is Japanese for visual signal or card.

9
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:27,370
Toyota line workers used a kanban,

10
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:31,570
an actual physical card to show steps in their manufacturing process.

11
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:35,087
The system's visual nature allows teams to communicate more

12
00:00:35,087 --> 00:00:37,620
easily on what work needed to be done and when.

13
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:41,580
It also standardized its queues, things you put on the cards,

14
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:44,610
such as numbers, colors, icons, and things like that,

15
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:50,580
which help refine the processes which help to reduce waste and maximize value.

16
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:52,600
Kanban has a simple board layout.

17
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,620
Think of it as a big whiteboard, if you will,

18
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:58,590
that has sections or columns such as a to do column,

19
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:01,580
a doing column, or a done column.

20
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:05,550
Basically, your backlog, your in work, and complete.

21
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:10,550
Be creative and add additional columns or sections if you like, such as re-do.

22
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:13,590
Maybe this is the defect column from work in progress,

23
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:16,968
maybe user acceptance testing column, and lastly,

24
00:01:16,968 --> 00:01:17,610
a production column.

25
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:20,540
In other words, you're finally done with the ticket.

26
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:21,610
Now, before I show you an example,

27
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:26,570
let's check out some of the benefits of using kanban.

28
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:28,620
Let's review the key benefits of kanban.

29
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:31,600
It enhances a team's ability to focus.

30
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,590
I think we all focus better when you have a visual dimension

31
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:37,570
with only the critical data on the board.

32
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:40,530
Offers flexibility and ease of use.

33
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:42,560
There is no one perfect way to do kanban.

34
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,600
Shape it for your team's effectiveness.

35
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,560
Sounds like agile to me.

36
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,620
Provides easy-to-comprehend visuals.

37
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:53,540
Visuals are simple and clear, therefore easy to understand.

38
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:55,580
I'm a very visual person, so I love it.

39
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:57,600
Focuses on continuous delivery.

40
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:03,530
With kanban, you see the flow of work from backlog to delivery or completion.

41
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:06,590
You see each step of your delivery process very easily.

42
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:08,620
Reduces wasted work and time.

43
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:13,560
If you use kanban, I truly believe you'll save time and money,

44
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,610
people work and collaborate better, and it promotes teamwork.

45
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:21,540
Lastly, it increase productivity and efficiency.

46
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,540
Because of the items I've mentioned above,

47
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,590
you will see an increase in productivity.

48
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,610
Also, what people don't always realize,

49
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:31,704
doing the wrong work at the wrong time isn't work at all,

50
00:02:31,704 --> 00:02:32,570
it's just waste.

51
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:35,550
Kanban helps doing the work right.

52
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:38,620
Alright, now let's see an example.

53
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:43,540
For our example, every ticket is represented by a kanban card.

54
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:44,620
It is a unit of work.

55
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:46,590
Kanban's board has a grid.

56
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:50,570
This one is simple with three columns, but you can get creative.

57
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:53,580
Here is our to do list on the left, or our backlog.

58
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:57,590
The next column are all the things we are doing, work in progress.

59
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:01,530
And next are the things that have been recently completed.

60
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:02,620
I'd like to see the done column.

61
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:05,206
Since I can't remember everything we've finished and

62
00:03:05,206 --> 00:03:10,560
it reinforces our accomplishments, that is a feel-good thing for me and the team.

63
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,313
And maybe they fall off the board after two weeks or some

64
00:03:13,313 --> 00:03:15,540
other timeframe that works for you.

65
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:15,752
Now,

66
00:03:15,752 --> 00:03:19,590
underlying all of this should be your automated ticketing and workflow system.

67
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:21,580
It could be that when tickets first come in,

68
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:25,550
they are in a pending column, then they move to a triage,

69
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:28,540
and then they move to the to do column, or backlog column.

70
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,600
Design it as you see fit with your team.

71
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:35,550
Now let's look at grooming the kanban board.

72
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:38,530
Now let's go through a kanban example.

73
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:42,072
And what I like about kanban is that it is simple,

74
00:03:42,072 --> 00:03:44,610
visual, easy to understand, and very flexible.

75
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:47,550
Alright, here's our grid with three columns.

76
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:50,590
Our to do column on the left or our demand column,

77
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:56,540
our doing or work in progress column, and our done or completed item column.

78
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:00,570
And here are all our to do or demand items as tickets on the left.

79
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:03,600
And the center column will have our work in progress cards.

80
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,560
And lastly, of course, our done cards.

81
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:12,580
Now, if we have identified the purple ticket as approved and resourced,

82
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:16,570
then we are ready to move that ticket to the doing column.

83
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:19,560
So let's move it.

84
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,600
It is that easy.

85
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,610
Drag and drop the tickets as you need to.

86
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:26,325
And if you are in a conference room using a

87
00:04:26,325 --> 00:04:28,560
widescreen monitor or over the internet,

88
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,560
it is very easy for people to understand.

89
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:36,600
Now, let's look at a sample screen from an automated tool.

90
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:41,580
I thought it would be a good idea to see a sample board from a real tool.

91
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:44,580
They really can look almost like my PowerPoint examples.

92
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:47,540
As you can see, here is the to do column,

93
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:51,570
then the doing column, and lastly, the done column.

94
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:55,570
But also, you can see the collapsed column on the left called backlog.

95
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:59,620
And my guess is that the designer of this board called the backlog,

96
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:03,530
as those items still needing some amount of triage,

97
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:06,560
and after the triage they are promoted to the to do column,

98
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,540
that is, it is ready to be resourced.

99
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,590
That is what's so nice and simple about the kanban.

100
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:15,530
Set it up any way you want to meet your requirements.

101
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:18,580
And notice on the right that they've added an archive column.

102
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:19,560
Perfect!

103
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:23,600
So after, say, two weeks the ticket or card will flow into the archive.

104
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:28,580
Now let's talk about the kanban card itself.

105
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:31,530
Designing kanban cards.

106
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:33,943
You can annotate your kanban cards to contain a brief

107
00:05:33,943 --> 00:05:35,610
but rich amount of information.

108
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:39,906
Choose annotations that make sense to you and your team to

109
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:42,540
help you make timely and quality decisions.

110
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:46,560
Maybe green means a particular system, like a sales management system,

111
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,530
so they are very easy to see and identify.

112
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:51,590
Now let's say I want to drill into one of the green tickets.

113
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:55,437
Here is a ticket with reference number 12345 and a

114
00:05:55,437 --> 00:05:59,590
brief description of the requirement, 12 month scheduling feature.

115
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:03,580
Next we are showing who worked the ticket, that's Joe and Mary.

116
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,570
And the estimate of 32 hours.

117
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:08,620
Maybe it'd be great if we included the actual hours used as well.

118
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:11,610
You can usually pick the type of information you need

119
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:13,610
that is relevant for you and your team.

120
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:19,560
Now, let's see an example of inserting additional columns in our board.

121
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:23,610
Here is a variation that I like to call the re-do or defect option.

122
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:28,620
Here's our grid, here is the to dos, here are the doing or work in progress,

123
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,610
and here is the done column.

124
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:33,560
And here we add the re-do column.

125
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:38,540
It means it was once in the done column, but a defect was found.

126
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,560
You could certainly just put it in the to do column,

127
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:45,610
that is fine, but I like the re-do column since it is of a higher priority.

128
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:49,610
The customer may be a bit upset and it provides focus to the team.

129
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:52,560
Plus if something comes back into the re-do column,

130
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,530
then I think it deserves a higher priority and hence more focus and attention.

131
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:57,974
Remember,

132
00:06:57,974 --> 00:07:02,354
anything in the doing or in work column can always go

133
00:07:02,354 --> 00:07:07,560
back to being in the to do list, that is back in the demand state at any time.

134
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:12,174
And don't be afraid to stop work on anything in order to free

135
00:07:12,174 --> 00:07:14,610
resources to another more important task.

136
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:18,293
Now, you could add even more columns that represent UAT,

137
00:07:18,293 --> 00:07:21,910
or user acceptance testing, and promote to production,

138
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:22,590
for example.

139
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:27,610
Be creative not only with columns but the information on the card as well.

140
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:32,600
Just be sure it is very simple, easy to read and understand,

141
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,590
even by your management or a customer, for that matter.

142
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:40,620
Now let's see how to run a kanban discussion.

143
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:44,570
It is one thing to say use kanban as a technique,

144
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:47,540
but it is another to use it effectively.

145
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:48,610
Communication is critical.

146
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:49,683
Here is an approach,

147
00:07:49,683 --> 00:07:53,269
and please feel free to modify it as you see fit to make

148
00:07:53,269 --> 00:07:55,610
better use of it in your organization.

149
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:58,590
Now, you may have heard of stand-ups with scrum, of course.

150
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:00,560
This is very similar.

151
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,580
Assemble your team.

152
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,570
If you are doing this face to face,

153
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:06,590
find a comfortable spot so you don't disturb others

154
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:08,590
and you can all see the board.

155
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:11,600
If you are doing it via the internet, such as using Slack,

156
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,570
then that works too, of course.

157
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:16,560
Begin with a lead-off statement, set the tone.

158
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,620
If any issues are critical, talk about those.

159
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:21,560
Maybe there is a change in management direction,

160
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,590
maybe someone is out sick or on vacation,

161
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:26,550
or maybe today is just a normal day.

162
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:28,530
Any changes to priorities?

163
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:31,910
Maybe you learn that manufacturing is behind schedule and as of 6

164
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:35,223
AM today the top priority in the company that everything

165
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:37,540
manufacturing must get moved through quickly.

166
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:40,887
Well, that would change your criteria for prioritizing your tickets,

167
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:41,560
wouldn't it?

168
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,590
Stop any items?

169
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:45,560
Well, based on the last statement regarding manufacturing,

170
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:48,442
we may want to stop one or more items so that we have the

171
00:08:48,442 --> 00:08:51,570
resources to allocate to manufacturing tickets.

172
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:53,600
And as we discussed using colored cards,

173
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,580
it would be easy to quickly identify those on the board

174
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:59,540
or filter them to make your decisions.

175
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:03,070
Now, randomly go around the team and solicit inputs,

176
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:05,620
asking each person, what did they do yesterday,

177
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:09,610
what do they plan to do today, and if there are any issues or blockers.

178
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:13,530
Those issues, if any, will play into the next few steps,

179
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:16,920
plus you now have a good feel of the team's health and how

180
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,540
they are feeling about what they're doing.

181
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:20,570
That's important.

182
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:23,550
Now, look at the board and start with work in progress.

183
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:28,530
And if you have a re-do or defect column, consider that as well.

184
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:29,560
Any blockers?

185
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:32,570
That is any impediments to continuing with those tickets?

186
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:36,610
To make the best decisions, we'll use any top-down information from management,

187
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:40,530
you will use the feedback from getting inputs from the team,

188
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:43,610
and you will review the board to make any adjustments you might have to make.

189
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:46,530
Adjust resources and move tickets.

190
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:48,590
You may need to change resources, for example.

191
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:51,587
You might have moved a ticket to backlog and took that

192
00:09:51,587 --> 00:09:53,580
resource to help on another ticket.

193
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:56,550
Do it every morning no matter who is missing.

194
00:09:56,550 --> 00:10:01,530
In real critical times, you may consider a second one around 1 or 2 PM,

195
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:03,550
or pick a tempo that works for you.

196
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:13,000
Now let's contrast sprints with kanban and when you might want to use one over the other in the next section.
