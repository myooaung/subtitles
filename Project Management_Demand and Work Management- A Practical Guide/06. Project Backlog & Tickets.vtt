1
00:00:02.368 --> 00:00:04.398
Project Backlog and Tickets.

2
00:00:04.398 --> 00:00:11.408
Let's go through project demand in a similar fashion as we did for operations.

3
00:00:11.408 --> 00:00:15.378
Now here is a new project process that you can use as a starter,

4
00:00:15.378 --> 00:00:19.000
and then change it as you see fit for your own organization.

5
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.328
First, all the new tickets are coming into the ticket queue for new projects.

6
00:00:23.328 --> 00:00:25.338
So these are new project requests.

7
00:00:25.338 --> 00:00:28.358
These can be monitored each day, weekly or whatever makes sense.

8
00:00:28.358 --> 00:00:31.328
Maybe projects are monitored daily or maybe weekly.

9
00:00:31.328 --> 00:00:36.338
Then your team will perform triage on these new project tickets,

10
00:00:36.338 --> 00:00:39.338
and if you can, like I mentioned before for operations,

11
00:00:39.338 --> 00:00:41.388
a team is probably better than one person,

12
00:00:41.388 --> 00:00:44.212
even more so for projects because projects could be

13
00:00:44.212 --> 00:00:46.348
quite large and quite complicated.

14
00:00:46.348 --> 00:00:48.752
So you're going to review the project tickets and you're going

15
00:00:48.752 --> 00:00:51.937
to look at the attributes that you're collecting for projects to

16
00:00:51.937 --> 00:00:54.338
see: Is it worthy to be a project?

17
00:00:54.338 --> 00:00:56.338
Is there any information missing?

18
00:00:56.338 --> 00:00:59.368
Do I have to go back and talk to the project requester?

19
00:00:59.368 --> 00:01:03.134
Now some of these projects may not be applicable or may be out of

20
00:01:03.134 --> 00:01:06.388
scope or belong in someone else's project queue.

21
00:01:06.388 --> 00:01:08.388
So you're going to maybe reassign these.

22
00:01:08.388 --> 00:01:10.398
Next, maybe there's a production issue.

23
00:01:10.398 --> 00:01:11.408
You might say, "Wait a minute.

24
00:01:11.408 --> 00:01:14.185
"If it's production, "we want to send that back to operations,

25
00:01:14.185 --> 00:01:16.398
" and that may also be out of scope.

26
00:01:16.398 --> 00:01:19.398
Lastly, they're going to be all what I call the normal backlog.

27
00:01:19.398 --> 00:01:23.082
These are new tickets that come in that are worthy to be new

28
00:01:23.082 --> 00:01:25.408
projects and to be considered in your backlog.

29
00:01:25.408 --> 00:01:28.378
Now let's take a look at the definition of backlog

30
00:01:28.378 --> 00:01:32.328
and what that means for project.

31
00:01:32.328 --> 00:01:36.328
Now let's define in general what a project backlog means.

32
00:01:36.328 --> 00:01:40.328
It's going to be the prioritized projects list containing short

33
00:01:40.328 --> 00:01:43.378
descriptions of the project's purpose and outcomes.

34
00:01:43.378 --> 00:01:47.398
Now for each project backlog item, we're going to capture key attributes,

35
00:01:47.398 --> 00:01:52.318
key bits of information that will help you make good decisions.

36
00:01:52.318 --> 00:01:55.378
So this is very similar to the operations backlog,

37
00:01:55.378 --> 00:01:58.348
but the attributes themselves may be somewhat similar,

38
00:01:58.348 --> 00:01:59.775
but they will also be different and we're going to talk

39
00:01:59.775 --> 00:02:02.348
about those in a couple more slides.

40
00:02:02.348 --> 00:02:05.358
Obviously, the items in this list will be chunkier,

41
00:02:05.358 --> 00:02:08.388
likely larger level of efforts and time durations,

42
00:02:08.388 --> 00:02:13.348
but at a macro level, no different again as the operations backlog.

43
00:02:13.348 --> 00:02:16.338
So before we talk about those key attributes for projects,

44
00:02:16.338 --> 00:02:21.358
let's review the project backlog assessment process first.

45
00:02:21.358 --> 00:02:24.068
Here's an approach to performing ticket assessment once it

46
00:02:24.068 --> 00:02:26.378
is in the normal backlog for project.

47
00:02:26.378 --> 00:02:28.388
First, assess the backlog item.

48
00:02:28.388 --> 00:02:32.398
So you or someone else or a small team will review each project.

49
00:02:32.398 --> 00:02:35.408
Next, the assessor owns this project item.

50
00:02:35.408 --> 00:02:37.398
Never have a ticket be unowned.

51
00:02:37.398 --> 00:02:41.398
So until it is assigned or the project is launched to someone else,

52
00:02:41.398 --> 00:02:45.318
it is owned by the assessor of this process.

53
00:02:45.318 --> 00:02:47.388
Next, provide feedback to the ticket creator,

54
00:02:47.388 --> 00:02:50.358
for example, by sending a confirmation email,

55
00:02:50.358 --> 00:02:52.348
or a Slack message, for example,

56
00:02:52.348 --> 00:02:56.378
or the ticketing system itself may have a feedback loop to the requester.

57
00:02:56.378 --> 00:02:59.398
You want to inform your requester that the ticket is under review,

58
00:02:59.398 --> 00:03:03.368
and please reply within a reasonable timeframe.

59
00:03:03.368 --> 00:03:04.348
This way,

60
00:03:04.348 --> 00:03:06.780
they know that their project request was received and it's

61
00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.388
being looked at by you and your team.

62
00:03:08.388 --> 00:03:11.944
This gives the requester a lot of comfort and they feel

63
00:03:11.944 --> 00:03:14.868
like you're doing a good job before you've even started to

64
00:03:14.868 --> 00:03:16.378
implement the project itself.

65
00:03:16.378 --> 00:03:19.338
Next, you want to analyze the request.

66
00:03:19.338 --> 00:03:22.398
Ask the requester questions, get clarifications,

67
00:03:22.398 --> 00:03:25.408
or ask other Subject-Matter Experts for inputs.

68
00:03:25.408 --> 00:03:28.328
Spend maybe only a couple hours on this.

69
00:03:28.328 --> 00:03:30.318
Again, this isn't an operational one.

70
00:03:30.318 --> 00:03:33.769
This is a ticket for a new project and it might require

71
00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:38.398
many many more hours of analysis, but do the initial review of the ticket,

72
00:03:38.398 --> 00:03:42.000
that is new project request, for a few hours if you can.

73
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.378
Next, update all the attributes that you can for this ticket item,

74
00:03:45.378 --> 00:03:49.507
and each item will have attributes and information of value which

75
00:03:49.507 --> 00:03:51.398
we will go over in detail in the next slide.

76
00:03:51.398 --> 00:03:52.378
All right.

77
00:03:52.378 --> 00:03:55.880
Now let's talk about those attributed fields that we want to add or attach

78
00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.388
to this particular ticket request for a new project.

79
00:03:58.388 --> 00:04:02.368
Again, based on the data that's been collected for this project,

80
00:04:02.368 --> 00:04:04.378
you may have a lot of information already,

81
00:04:04.378 --> 00:04:08.037
but you want to also capture the minimum amount of information

82
00:04:08.037 --> 00:04:12.348
that's necessary to make good decisions.

83
00:04:12.348 --> 00:04:15.562
Here is an example list of project attributes that

84
00:04:15.562 --> 00:04:17.358
might work for you as a starter list.

85
00:04:17.358 --> 00:04:22.318
Ultimately, the list of attributes is what you and your team needs to do the job.

86
00:04:22.318 --> 00:04:26.348
These will be similar to operations, but on a larger and grander scale.

87
00:04:26.348 --> 00:04:30.398
Okay, the first example, of course, an item number or a project number,

88
00:04:30.398 --> 00:04:33.365
and it should be unique so we can always refer to the

89
00:04:33.365 --> 00:04:35.318
project correctly and uniquely.

90
00:04:35.318 --> 00:04:37.388
Next, a short description of the item,

91
00:04:37.388 --> 00:04:42.318
something to ensure it's easy to read and easy to understand its intent.

92
00:04:42.318 --> 00:04:45.388
For example, develop new health care application workflow system.

93
00:04:45.388 --> 00:04:46.378
Next, a category.

94
00:04:46.378 --> 00:04:49.704
I call it just project because maybe there's other categories like

95
00:04:49.704 --> 00:04:52.338
operations and initiatives and things like that.

96
00:04:52.338 --> 00:04:54.408
Next is level of effort, LOE.

97
00:04:54.408 --> 00:04:57.368
Now it could be a bit chunky, like small,

98
00:04:57.368 --> 00:05:02.318
medium, large, similar to scrum style, or it could be a number of hours.

99
00:05:02.318 --> 00:05:04.358
For example, 4, 000 hours might be an estimate.

100
00:05:04.358 --> 00:05:06.358
Maybe small is at least 400 hours.

101
00:05:06.358 --> 00:05:08.398
Medium might be between 600 and 1, 000.

102
00:05:08.398 --> 00:05:13.348
Large might be 1, 000, and maybe over 4, 000 is maybe jumbo.

103
00:05:13.348 --> 00:05:15.822
You would come up with your own category of values and their

104
00:05:15.822 --> 00:05:19.378
rationale and make it consistent across all projects.

105
00:05:19.378 --> 00:05:23.474
There's due date and that's going to be provided by the customer about

106
00:05:23.474 --> 00:05:26.318
when they would like that project to be completed.

107
00:05:26.318 --> 00:05:30.408
Again, blockers, what items are blocking or impeding this item to be completed,

108
00:05:30.408 --> 00:05:31.388
and in this case,

109
00:05:31.388 --> 00:05:35.713
the example would be maybe we need to wait for a new VP to be hired

110
00:05:35.713 --> 00:05:37.398
or something like that so we have good leadership.

111
00:05:37.398 --> 00:05:39.358
Next is risks.

112
00:05:39.358 --> 00:05:41.388
What risks might there be in this project,

113
00:05:41.388 --> 00:05:44.328
such as lost revenue, things like that.

114
00:05:44.328 --> 00:05:48.328
Again, a risk is something that might happen in the future to affect the project.

115
00:05:48.328 --> 00:05:50.378
Next is the sponsor, such as a CEO.

116
00:05:50.378 --> 00:05:52.388
Again, if the CEO was sponsoring this project,

117
00:05:52.388 --> 00:05:55.338
it's probably something that'll go high in your list.

118
00:05:55.338 --> 00:05:57.378
Next is urgency and impact.

119
00:05:57.378 --> 00:06:02.398
High and significant impact on customer retention might be an example.

120
00:06:02.398 --> 00:06:07.368
In other words, it's a high urgency and significant impact on customer retention.

121
00:06:07.368 --> 00:06:09.368
That sounds very important.

122
00:06:09.368 --> 00:06:10.000
Next,

123
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.385
the business domain of your company or corporation or your

124
00:06:13.385 --> 00:06:16.338
target audience: health care supply chain.

125
00:06:16.338 --> 00:06:20.358
Next, which is usually really important in projects, is the budget.

126
00:06:20.358 --> 00:06:22.750
Let's say the budget here is at $1.

127
00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:26.348
5 million and the return on investment, sometimes known as the ROI,

128
00:06:26.348 --> 00:06:27.348
is nine months.

129
00:06:27.348 --> 00:06:29.583
That means if I invest $1.

130
00:06:29.583 --> 00:06:30.328
5 million,

131
00:06:30.328 --> 00:06:35.053
I should see savings or increase revenue or things that go right to

132
00:06:35.053 --> 00:06:38.318
the bottom line within the nine months of time.

133
00:06:38.318 --> 00:06:41.368
Lastly, priority and window of opportunity.

134
00:06:41.368 --> 00:06:44.378
Now for priority, I prefer using more of a macro tag,

135
00:06:44.378 --> 00:06:46.358
like high, medium, and low,

136
00:06:46.358 --> 00:06:50.470
and the window of opportunity is a timeframe within which the

137
00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:53.408
project must be launched to be of success,

138
00:06:53.408 --> 00:06:56.408
and in this example, if we don't launch this within six months,

139
00:06:56.408 --> 00:07:01.358
we may lose the opportunity to have this be a success at all.

140
00:07:01.358 --> 00:07:05.087
Now priority's a category that identifies the relative importance of this

141
00:07:05.087 --> 00:07:08.964
project to others and priority is typically based on impact,

142
00:07:08.964 --> 00:07:13.348
urgency, window of opportunity, and maybe even the sponsor.

143
00:07:13.348 --> 00:07:15.842
Notice the attributes are all about collecting information to

144
00:07:15.842 --> 00:07:19.318
provide you the data you need to prioritize,

145
00:07:19.318 --> 00:07:22.408
assign resources and decide if or when to start the project.

146
00:07:22.408 --> 00:07:26.388
None of the attributes have to do with actually working the projects.

147
00:07:26.388 --> 00:07:34.000
That comes later, after it has been approved to be worked. Now let's move on to grooming for projects.
