00:00:00.563 --> 00:00:00.846
Now,

2
00:00:00.846 --> 00:00:04.021
let's take the five process groups of traditional project

3
00:00:04.021 --> 00:00:06.603
management and compare and contrast them to Agile.

4
00:00:06.603 --> 00:00:10.553
So across the top, we'll put the five traditional process groups.

5
00:00:10.553 --> 00:00:14.557
Conception and initiation, planning, execution,

6
00:00:14.557 --> 00:00:18.583
performance and monitoring, and closure.

7
00:00:18.583 --> 00:00:23.563
And over on the left, we have the Agile and I made these columns, as well.

8
00:00:23.563 --> 00:00:27.513
So on the far left, we'll come down with the Agile process groups.

9
00:00:27.513 --> 00:00:32.533
Project, release, iteration and daily work.

10
00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:34.737
And what I'm going to do then is I'm going to put into

11
00:00:34.737 --> 00:00:37.866
each of these columns and row intersections to cells how

12
00:00:37.866 --> 00:00:39.533
they relate to the traditional.

13
00:00:39.533 --> 00:00:41.523
So let's start with project.

14
00:00:41.523 --> 00:00:42.563
Business case.

15
00:00:42.563 --> 00:00:45.563
That would be like conception and initiation.

16
00:00:45.563 --> 00:00:46.573
Project kick-off.

17
00:00:46.573 --> 00:00:48.563
That would be like planning.

18
00:00:48.563 --> 00:00:52.513
Iterative and incremental delivery of working software.

19
00:00:52.513 --> 00:00:56.523
That's the Agile term and we'll be doing that in execution.

20
00:00:56.523 --> 00:01:00.543
Regular reviews and deliverables, progress and process.

21
00:01:00.543 --> 00:01:03.543
That's similar to performance and monitoring.

22
00:01:03.543 --> 00:01:07.053
And we have our project retrospectives and in the traditional,

23
00:01:07.053 --> 00:01:08.543
we call that closure.

24
00:01:08.543 --> 00:01:10.523
Now, for the release row.

25
00:01:10.523 --> 00:01:11.603
Roadmap and release definition.

26
00:01:11.603 --> 00:01:14.543
That would relate to conception and initiation.

27
00:01:14.543 --> 00:01:17.543
Release planning would be like our regular planning.

28
00:01:17.543 --> 00:01:21.563
Iterative and incremental delivery of working software, again, execution.

29
00:01:21.563 --> 00:01:24.573
Regular reviews of deliverables and progress and process,

30
00:01:24.573 --> 00:01:26.603
that'd be like performance and monitoring.

31
00:01:26.603 --> 00:01:29.533
And release retrospective.

32
00:01:29.533 --> 00:01:30.603
Next would be iteration.

33
00:01:30.603 --> 00:01:34.533
Iteration planning would be like conception and initiation.

34
00:01:34.533 --> 00:01:37.513
Iteration planning, again like planning.

35
00:01:37.513 --> 00:01:40.543
Work features through to completion, that's execution.

36
00:01:40.543 --> 00:01:42.252
Task boards, charts, stand-ups,

37
00:01:42.252 --> 00:01:45.573
acceptance of features would be like performance and monitoring.

38
00:01:45.573 --> 00:01:49.593
An iteration demo review and retrospective would be like closure.

39
00:01:49.593 --> 00:01:51.583
Next is daily work.

40
00:01:51.583 --> 00:01:56.563
That'd be like morning hellos (laughs) for initiating the day.

41
00:01:56.563 --> 00:01:59.593
Daily stand-ups would be our daily planning.

42
00:01:59.593 --> 00:02:02.523
Just working the task through to completion.

43
00:02:02.523 --> 00:02:03.593
That's execution.

44
00:02:03.593 --> 00:02:07.603
Attention to blockers and solutions would be like performance and monitoring.

45
00:02:07.603 --> 00:02:10.603
And closure would be the task and burndown chart.

46
00:02:10.603 --> 00:02:15.719
So what I've tried to do here is show roughly how the Agile

47
00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:19.046
process groups and all the Agile work would overlay the

48
00:02:19.046 --> 00:02:20.583
traditional project planning.

49
00:02:20.583 --> 00:02:23.523
I think it gives you a nice relative view.

50
00:02:23.523 --> 00:02:26.738
If you're familiar with the traditional project approach now

51
00:02:26.738 --> 00:02:28.583
you can see how we relate to the Agile.

52
00:02:28.583 --> 00:02:30.593
If you're familiar with the Agile approach,

53
00:02:30.593 --> 00:02:33.900
now you can see how we relate to the traditional approach,

54
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:34.583
as well.

55
00:02:34.583 --> 00:02:38.553
Okay, on to a great quote.

56
00:02:38.553 --> 00:02:39.593
Here's a good quote.

57
00:02:39.593 --> 00:02:44.162
"However beautiful the strategy, "you should occasionally look at the results.

58
00:02:44.162 --> 00:02:46.583
" The point of this slide is that with Agile and Scrum,

59
00:02:46.583 --> 00:02:48.603
you have what's called the retrospective.

60
00:02:48.603 --> 00:02:51.765
I have seen quite often in the workplace that project

61
00:02:51.765 --> 00:02:54.751
closures and retrospectives are usually never performed

62
00:02:54.751 --> 00:02:56.593
since everyone is just too busy.

63
00:02:56.593 --> 00:02:58.573
Now that is a mistake.

64
00:02:58.573 --> 00:03:01.962
It is important that an Agile retrospective meeting is

65
00:03:01.962 --> 00:03:05.099
held at the end of each iteration, each release,

66
00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:07.603
and of course, at the end of the project.

67
00:03:07.603 --> 00:03:10.513
Much can be learned and improved upon.

68
00:03:10.513 --> 00:03:16.000
And it greatly helps morale, as well. Okay, now let's summarize this module.
