00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:07.999
Level of effort, or LOE, is used to define the amount of work.

2
00:00:07.999 --> 00:00:10.089
It can be measured in days, or hours per day,

3
00:00:10.089 --> 00:00:14.079
per week, per month, or in a relative manner,

4
00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:19.029
such as large, medium, or small, for example.

5
00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:22.029
And, within, also, a relative timeframe.

6
00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:23.669
For example, a large effort of work may,

7
00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:27.079
in general, take about three months of elapsed time.

8
00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:33.059
Now, let's see some examples of the level of effort across each demand type.

9
00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.049
For operations, a simple example may be smaller LOE,

10
00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:42.079
such as add a drop down with some values in it.

11
00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:47.999
For projects, a simple example may be more like a medium LOE,

12
00:00:47.999 --> 00:00:50.192
and where more analysis may be needed before you

13
00:00:50.192 --> 00:00:52.999
even understand the demand itself,

14
00:00:52.999 --> 00:00:58.039
such as a new module to enable users to fill out healthcare applications online.

15
00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:02.359
For initiatives, a simple example may be a much larger LOE,

16
00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:07.009
with large budgets, and intense senior executive involvement,

17
00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:10.049
in other words, people with a lot of influence,

18
00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.059
such as increase revenue by 15%.

19
00:01:13.059 --> 00:01:16.079
That would be a significant initiative.

20
00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:20.029
So, you can see a general size, or level of effort,

21
00:01:20.029 --> 00:01:20.707
or scale,

22
00:01:20.707 --> 00:01:26.089
that seems to imply in my examples just what constitutes an operational task,

23
00:01:26.089 --> 00:01:30.039
a project, or an initiative.

24
00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:34.176
In the next module, we will talk about the processes required to triage,

25
00:01:34.176 --> 00:01:37.049
or identify, each piece of work, demand,

26
00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.059
and how to execute it.

27
00:01:39.059 --> 00:01:41.089
Now, did you notice anything about these guys?

28
00:01:41.089 --> 00:01:44.079
How might you characterize the succinctness,

29
00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:49.029
or conciseness of the requirement or work request?

30
00:01:49.029 --> 00:01:53.069
Well, that's what this course is all about, to help you do just that.

31
00:01:53.069 --> 00:02:01.000
Well, speaking of people with influence, let's take a look at the various types of influencers.
