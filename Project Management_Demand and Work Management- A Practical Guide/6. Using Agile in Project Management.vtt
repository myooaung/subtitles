00:00:00.293 --> 00:00:03.263
Using Agile in Project Management.

2
00:00:03.263 --> 00:00:07.283
The previous section discussed the traditional project management process.

3
00:00:07.283 --> 00:00:11.253
This process does work very well and is still in use today.

4
00:00:11.253 --> 00:00:14.577
But I would like to spend a few minutes discussing an Agile

5
00:00:14.577 --> 00:00:19.213
approach to project management in this section.

6
00:00:19.213 --> 00:00:21.253
Here's a quote to lead off this section.

7
00:00:21.253 --> 00:00:24.303
"It is not the strongest of the species that survive,

8
00:00:24.303 --> 00:00:29.848
"nor the most intelligent, "but the ones most responsive to change,

9
00:00:29.848 --> 00:00:32.243
" stated by Charles Darwin.

10
00:00:32.243 --> 00:00:35.243
That is what makes the Agile approach so powerful.

11
00:00:35.243 --> 00:00:37.273
It is designed for change.

12
00:00:37.273 --> 00:00:42.233
Every single business I have ever seen is constantly changing.

13
00:00:42.233 --> 00:00:43.293
So why not give this a try?

14
00:00:43.293 --> 00:00:47.213
Let's learn more.

15
00:00:47.213 --> 00:00:50.213
Here is a basic definition of Agile.

16
00:00:50.213 --> 00:00:54.516
Agile describes a set of principles and practices for

17
00:00:54.516 --> 00:00:58.253
delivering software or for that matter, any product or service.

18
00:00:58.253 --> 00:01:01.973
The principles and practice are the underpinnings for

19
00:01:01.973 --> 00:01:06.233
many Agile frameworks such as Scrum.

20
00:01:06.233 --> 00:01:10.046
Here are the key principles and practices of Agile but there are

21
00:01:10.046 --> 00:01:12.213
more if you're so inclined to research them.

22
00:01:12.213 --> 00:01:16.529
Highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and

23
00:01:16.529 --> 00:01:21.213
continuous delivery of valuable that is usable software.

24
00:01:21.213 --> 00:01:23.253
Welcome changing requirements.

25
00:01:23.253 --> 00:01:25.233
Even late in development,

26
00:01:25.233 --> 00:01:29.263
Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.

27
00:01:29.263 --> 00:01:31.897
Business owners and developers must work closely

28
00:01:31.897 --> 00:01:34.273
together daily throughout the project.

29
00:01:34.273 --> 00:01:38.293
Working software is the primary measure of progress.

30
00:01:38.293 --> 00:01:44.233
Simplicity, the art of maximizing the amount of work not done is essential.

31
00:01:44.233 --> 00:01:46.253
Remember how easy it is to goal play?

32
00:01:46.253 --> 00:01:48.875
That is develop requirements that are not really

33
00:01:48.875 --> 00:01:51.233
necessary at the moment in time?

34
00:01:51.233 --> 00:01:55.263
At regular intervals, reflect on how to become more effective,

35
00:01:55.263 --> 00:01:59.233
then tune and adjust your team's behavior accordingly.

36
00:01:59.233 --> 00:02:02.994
These are just some of the basic examples of Agile principles on

37
00:02:02.994 --> 00:02:07.263
which other methodologies were built upon.

38
00:02:07.263 --> 00:02:11.213
Here are some examples of Agile methodologies in use today.

39
00:02:11.213 --> 00:02:14.233
Scrum, which is probably the most widely used.

40
00:02:14.233 --> 00:02:17.213
eXtreme Programming known as XP,

41
00:02:17.213 --> 00:02:20.258
Dynamic Systems Development Method and Adaptive

42
00:02:20.258 --> 00:02:22.293
Software Development and there's more, of course.

43
00:02:22.293 --> 00:02:24.273
Since the Agile approach is different,

44
00:02:24.273 --> 00:02:26.913
you might imagine that the roles have changed

45
00:02:26.913 --> 00:02:30.293
somewhat from traditional projects.

46
00:02:30.293 --> 00:02:33.283
Since Scrum is the most widely used today,

47
00:02:33.283 --> 00:02:37.253
let's talk about the new key roles of a Scrum-based project.

48
00:02:37.253 --> 00:02:41.554
Each of these roles has a defined set of responsibilities and only if

49
00:02:41.554 --> 00:02:44.963
they fulfill these responsibilities and closely interact and work

50
00:02:44.963 --> 00:02:48.213
together can they finish the project successfully.

51
00:02:48.213 --> 00:02:50.213
Okay, the Scrum team.

52
00:02:50.213 --> 00:02:52.293
It is composed of three roles.

53
00:02:52.293 --> 00:02:54.303
The first, the Scrum Master.

54
00:02:54.303 --> 00:02:58.243
And the Scrum Master role has two distinct subroles.

55
00:02:58.243 --> 00:03:01.273
First, he or she acts as the protector of the team,

56
00:03:01.273 --> 00:03:03.263
making sure that everyone on the project,

57
00:03:03.263 --> 00:03:06.377
especially the development team members can focus on

58
00:03:06.377 --> 00:03:08.233
their work without any distractions.

59
00:03:08.233 --> 00:03:11.120
The second element of the Scrum Master role is to

60
00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.213
protect the Scrum process itself.

61
00:03:13.213 --> 00:03:17.293
The Scrum Master is the expert on how Scrum works and how it should be applied.

62
00:03:17.293 --> 00:03:20.611
He or she will ensure that the product owner and

63
00:03:20.611 --> 00:03:23.253
development team stay within the Scrum framework,

64
00:03:23.253 --> 00:03:24.497
and to a greater degree,

65
00:03:24.497 --> 00:03:28.146
the Scrum Master can coach the other team members on how to

66
00:03:28.146 --> 00:03:30.253
use Scrum in the most effective manner.

67
00:03:30.253 --> 00:03:30.760
Now note,

68
00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.263
this is a very different role from that of a traditional project manager.

69
00:03:35.263 --> 00:03:38.243
Despite frequent comparisons made between the two,

70
00:03:38.243 --> 00:03:41.810
project managers are responsible for managing the work of the project

71
00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.263
team members and that guides their own day-to-day work.

72
00:03:44.263 --> 00:03:46.213
For the Scrum Master however,

73
00:03:46.213 --> 00:03:49.273
the only formal accountability is over the process itself.

74
00:03:49.273 --> 00:03:52.223
Another new role is the development team.

75
00:03:52.223 --> 00:03:53.273
Within the Scrum framework,

76
00:03:53.273 --> 00:03:57.263
all work delivered to the customer is done by dedicated Scrum teams.

77
00:03:57.263 --> 00:04:01.045
A Scrum team is a collection of individuals working together to

78
00:04:01.045 --> 00:04:03.293
deliver requested and committed product elements.

79
00:04:03.293 --> 00:04:05.263
And the development team is just that.

80
00:04:05.263 --> 00:04:08.233
They're the software engineers developing the software.

81
00:04:08.233 --> 00:04:10.253
Then we have the Scrum Product Owner.

82
00:04:10.253 --> 00:04:13.273
The Product Owner is the cornerstone of the project's success,

83
00:04:13.273 --> 00:04:17.040
responsible for defining the work that needs to be

84
00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.223
completed and prioritizing that work.

85
00:04:19.223 --> 00:04:22.154
It may be comprised of an end user or a business

86
00:04:22.154 --> 00:04:24.233
user or a line of business user.

87
00:04:24.233 --> 00:04:25.273
It may even be a team.

88
00:04:25.273 --> 00:04:29.553
The Product Owner knows what they want and the development team

89
00:04:29.553 --> 00:04:32.233
designs it and builds it and delivers it to them.

90
00:04:32.233 --> 00:04:33.233
Then there's the synergy.

91
00:04:33.233 --> 00:04:36.273
In other words you've got to work together collaboratively.

92
00:04:36.273 --> 00:04:39.653
Now here we've only scratched the surface of the three Scrum roles but

93
00:04:39.653 --> 00:04:43.253
it's enough to establish that each is unique to Scrum.

94
00:04:43.253 --> 00:04:45.303
They're not simply revised waterfall roles.

95
00:04:45.303 --> 00:04:48.293
Further, each one complements the other.

96
00:04:48.293 --> 00:04:51.628
Success can only come from embracing all three and

97
00:04:51.628 --> 00:04:53.303
allowing them to work together.

98
00:04:53.303 --> 00:04:56.243
Now, as organizations move towards Scrum,

99
00:04:56.243 --> 00:04:59.213
it is vital that they support each of these roles,

100
00:04:59.213 --> 00:05:03.063
allowing time for expertise to develop and resisting comparisons

101
00:05:03.063 --> 00:05:11.000
between Scrum and waterfall or traditional approaches. Now let's check out Agile process groups.
