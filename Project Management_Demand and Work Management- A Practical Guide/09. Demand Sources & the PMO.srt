1
00:00:00,013 --> 00:00:02,013
Demand Sources and the PMO.

2
00:00:02,013 --> 00:00:03,003
In this section,

3
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:06,953
we will first refresh ourselves with the demand sources for initiatives,

4
00:00:06,953 --> 00:00:08,933
that is where do initiatives come from,

5
00:00:08,933 --> 00:00:14,280
and let's start laying out our need for the Portfolio Management Office,

6
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,953
the PMO.

7
00:00:15,953 --> 00:00:19,993
Now let's look at the sources of demand for the demand type initiatives.

8
00:00:19,993 --> 00:00:23,933
So where is all this work or demand coming from?

9
00:00:23,933 --> 00:00:24,953
Board of Directors.

10
00:00:24,953 --> 00:00:27,976
You don't get much more senior than the Board of Directors of a corporation,

11
00:00:27,976 --> 00:00:29,963
large or small for that matter.

12
00:00:29,963 --> 00:00:33,983
Typically, a Board is looking at very high-level and broad strategies.

13
00:00:33,983 --> 00:00:35,003
Steering groups.

14
00:00:35,003 --> 00:00:37,687
Many times these are comprised of senior company

15
00:00:37,687 --> 00:00:40,933
individuals across multiple business domains,

16
00:00:40,933 --> 00:00:43,013
such as manufacturing and engineering within the company.

17
00:00:43,013 --> 00:00:44,933
Senior Executives.

18
00:00:44,933 --> 00:00:46,444
They may band together to tackle problems and

19
00:00:46,444 --> 00:00:48,973
comprise their own list of initiatives.

20
00:00:48,973 --> 00:00:49,983
Business Leaders.

21
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:52,973
In this group, it's not only leaders in a company,

22
00:00:52,973 --> 00:00:57,670
but may also comprise of business leaders in a community or their supply chain,

23
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:58,943
as two examples.

24
00:00:58,943 --> 00:01:01,013
All of these make up your work intake, your demand,

25
00:01:01,013 --> 00:01:04,973
that is your initiative, demand of things people are asking,

26
00:01:04,973 --> 00:01:07,023
or maybe even telling you to do so.

27
00:01:07,023 --> 00:01:10,199
So this is the point at which the initiative demand

28
00:01:10,199 --> 00:01:13,516
management process begins and it begins by being managed

29
00:01:13,516 --> 00:01:17,953
by the Portfolio Management Office, the PMO.

30
00:01:17,953 --> 00:01:19,963
so the creation, privatization,

31
00:01:19,963 --> 00:01:23,963
and execution of the initiatives is managed by the PMO.

32
00:01:23,963 --> 00:01:27,003
Let's explore further.

33
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:30,953
Here are the key characteristics of a backlog of initiatives.

34
00:01:30,953 --> 00:01:33,993
The first, they are very large-scale, second,

35
00:01:33,993 --> 00:01:36,983
very senior executive focus, and as I mentioned before,

36
00:01:36,983 --> 00:01:40,023
like the Board of Directors and senior steering groups,

37
00:01:40,023 --> 00:01:41,003
the next,

38
00:01:41,003 --> 00:01:44,446
long-term outcomes which will have a significant

39
00:01:44,446 --> 00:01:47,013
strategic impact on the corporation.

40
00:01:47,013 --> 00:01:49,983
These are reviewed quarterly or semiannually.

41
00:01:49,983 --> 00:01:53,993
Please recall in operations backlog, we review them daily,

42
00:01:53,993 --> 00:01:57,993
with the project backlog, possibly weekly and monthly,

43
00:01:57,993 --> 00:02:02,943
and with the initiative backlog, they are reviewed quarterly or semiannually.

44
00:02:02,943 --> 00:02:04,953
Lastly, they're a bit hard to measure.

45
00:02:04,953 --> 00:02:07,023
Since these activities are so impactful and large,

46
00:02:07,023 --> 00:02:10,280
they tend to be harder to measure and to see whether

47
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,963
they're having the intended outcome.

48
00:02:11,963 --> 00:02:17,013
Okay, we need a PMO, a Portfolio Management Office, to manage all this.

49
00:02:17,013 --> 00:02:20,023
Let's see an example.

50
00:02:20,023 --> 00:02:23,993
Here is an example using the list of initiatives from a couple of slides ago.

51
00:02:23,993 --> 00:02:27,013
We're going to have our container or portfolio of initiatives,

52
00:02:27,013 --> 00:02:30,023
one of which is increase revenue by 15%.

53
00:02:30,023 --> 00:02:34,973
All initiatives will be managed by the PMO, the Portfolio Management Office.

54
00:02:34,973 --> 00:02:38,023
Now in order to achieve the goal of increasing revenue by 15%,

55
00:02:38,023 --> 00:02:42,488
let's clock up other key initiatives that instead of being sibling initiatives,

56
00:02:42,488 --> 00:02:43,973
they are subordinate.

57
00:02:43,973 --> 00:02:46,953
So building a new aircraft will be a program.

58
00:02:46,953 --> 00:02:50,112
We have multiple programs all supporting the higher-level initiative,

59
00:02:50,112 --> 00:02:52,933
to increase revenue by 15%.

60
00:02:52,933 --> 00:02:55,656
Now since programs can be a very significant amount of

61
00:02:55,656 --> 00:02:59,643
work and use a lot of resources, we will create a PMO,

62
00:02:59,643 --> 00:03:01,003
a Program Management Office.

63
00:03:01,003 --> 00:03:04,963
We typically have one program as an office per program.

64
00:03:04,963 --> 00:03:09,488
Now we have the program that is responsible to deliver the new CAD,

65
00:03:09,488 --> 00:03:10,973
computer-aided design system.

66
00:03:10,973 --> 00:03:12,963
It is made up, in our case here,

67
00:03:12,963 --> 00:03:17,003
in this example of two projects and an existing operations group.

68
00:03:17,003 --> 00:03:21,023
It is also managed by its own PMO, Program Management Office.

69
00:03:21,023 --> 00:03:24,023
Yes, we have PMO which is Portfolio Management,

70
00:03:24,023 --> 00:03:26,983
Program Management and Project Management.

71
00:03:26,983 --> 00:03:31,933
Yes, it is confusing, so just saying the word PMO sometimes isn't enough.

72
00:03:31,933 --> 00:03:33,933
Now, initiatives, programs,

73
00:03:33,933 --> 00:03:38,356
and projects are management constructs that you can use as tools or

74
00:03:38,356 --> 00:03:42,953
building blocks to best set up your organization to be the most efficient

75
00:03:42,953 --> 00:03:47,953
at managing your limited and precious resources.

76
00:03:47,953 --> 00:03:51,963
Here are the common goals for PMO, that is for any PMO,

77
00:03:51,963 --> 00:03:55,943
portfolio, program or project management offices.

78
00:03:55,943 --> 00:03:59,933
They all in general do the same things at a different level.

79
00:03:59,933 --> 00:04:04,973
So first, define and maintain standards, metrics and process for what they do.

80
00:04:04,973 --> 00:04:05,973
They all do that.

81
00:04:05,973 --> 00:04:07,963
Execute on time and on budget.

82
00:04:07,963 --> 00:04:10,983
That's very important as well for what they're responsible for.

83
00:04:10,983 --> 00:04:11,963
They manage.

84
00:04:11,963 --> 00:04:12,953
They plan.

85
00:04:12,953 --> 00:04:13,963
They prioritize.

86
00:04:13,963 --> 00:04:14,963
Lastly,

87
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:18,328
they perform cross-functional reporting and communication because

88
00:04:18,328 --> 00:04:21,023
portfolio certainly slice across an entire company,

89
00:04:21,023 --> 00:04:23,336
programs, maybe most of the company, projects,

90
00:04:23,336 --> 00:04:26,993
a good chunk of key areas of the company as well.

91
00:04:26,993 --> 00:04:30,003
So there's a lot of reporting and communication going on.

92
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:33,013
So basically, they will all function in a similar way,

93
00:04:33,013 --> 00:04:37,980
but at different levels of granularity where a portfolio is very strategic,

94
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:40,963
long-term, big picture, program's a little more focused,

95
00:04:40,963 --> 00:04:43,483
but always tied to an initiative, like many initiatives,

96
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:45,953
if you will, and finally projects,

97
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:48,544
which are very discreet and are either linked to an

98
00:04:48,544 --> 00:04:49,973
initiative or under a program.

99
00:04:49,973 --> 00:04:56,000
All right. In the next section, we're going to cover initiative governance and grooming.
