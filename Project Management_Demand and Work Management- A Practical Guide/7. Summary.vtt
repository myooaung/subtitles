00:00:01.292 --> 00:00:02.382
Now let's summarize this module.

2
00:00:02.382 --> 00:00:05.342
We learned the importance of initiative work management.

3
00:00:05.342 --> 00:00:09.969
In fact 89% of high-performing organizations use portfolio

4
00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:13.292
management as a means to support their initiatives.

5
00:00:13.292 --> 00:00:15.292
We learn the importance of the PMO.

6
00:00:15.292 --> 00:00:17.322
The Portfolio Management Office.

7
00:00:17.322 --> 00:00:20.544
That it is critical to establish an organizational structure,

8
00:00:20.544 --> 00:00:21.372
the PMO,

9
00:00:21.372 --> 00:00:25.459
that acts as the initiative process owner and the stewards

10
00:00:25.459 --> 00:00:27.372
of the company's strategic investments.

11
00:00:27.372 --> 00:00:31.228
We discussed the goal of having governance and it's to ensure and

12
00:00:31.228 --> 00:00:34.362
enhance the prosperity and viability of an organization,

13
00:00:34.362 --> 00:00:37.352
which includes of course maximizing the investment value.

14
00:00:37.352 --> 00:00:40.382
I showed you an example of a portfolio management workflow.

15
00:00:40.382 --> 00:00:43.302
Showing how we engage senior management,

16
00:00:43.302 --> 00:00:47.292
identify business initiatives and create our portfolio of initiatives,

17
00:00:47.292 --> 00:00:51.342
programs and projects, to support the company's long term strategies.

18
00:00:51.342 --> 00:00:54.560
We talked about designing portfolios and in this course I have

19
00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.828
shown that a portfolio is a collection of programs,

20
00:00:57.828 --> 00:01:01.312
operations and projects in support of one or more initiatives,

21
00:01:01.312 --> 00:01:04.840
but out in the real world the term portfolio may contain different

22
00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:07.372
components towards potentially lesser goals.

23
00:01:07.372 --> 00:01:11.322
Also we talked about how programs support portfolio outcomes.

24
00:01:11.322 --> 00:01:15.372
Programs exist in order to focus resources that will enable broader

25
00:01:15.372 --> 00:01:19.158
business benefits and objectives and we showed you an example of an

26
00:01:19.158 --> 00:01:21.352
organizational structure of a program.

27
00:01:21.352 --> 00:01:23.332
Lastly keep it lean.

28
00:01:23.332 --> 00:01:26.322
This does not need nor should it be bureaucratic.

29
00:01:26.322 --> 00:01:26.660
Okay,

30
00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.734
in the next module we will completely summarize our

31
00:01:29.734 --> 00:01:35.000
course and cover the key learning points. See you there.
