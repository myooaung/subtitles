00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:04,090
Hello I'm Michael Krasowski from Pluralsight.

2
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:08,070
I will be presenting the module, Building Your Initiative Management Process.

3
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:12,060
In the course, Demand and Work Management; a Practical Guide.

4
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:15,090
Okay, let's get started.

5
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:18,040
Let's recap demand versus work.

6
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:20,080
Demand, that's the stuff you have yet to do.

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,090
Also known as the backlog, and then there's work, the stuff you are doing.

8
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:28,070
Also known as work in progress or W-I-P, WIP.

9
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:32,230
Now earlier modules we talked about the work processes is for operations

10
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:36,380
and projects and now we're going to focus on the work processes for the

11
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:41,000
work type of initiatives in this module.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,040
Remember in the demand module, we talked about doing the right work.

13
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,090
Selecting and choosing the things we think are the right things to do,

14
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:51,080
and here we're talking about doing the work right.

15
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:55,279
Hence we have already decided that what we are doing has been vetted in the

16
00:00:55,279 --> 00:00:58,050
demand management process and we have just to get the job done.

17
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:00,060
So how are you going to get the job done?

18
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:03,000
That is what we'll be covering in this module,

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,050
Building Your Initiative Management Process.

20
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:10,030
Let's also recap the three work management types,

21
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:13,050
and these are a mirror image of the demand management types.

22
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:19,040
Operations, again ongoing, short bursts of activity may drive projects.

23
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,462
Any technical and domain knowledge certainly and that's

24
00:01:22,462 --> 00:01:24,010
what we covered a couple modules ago.

25
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:26,090
Next was projects, they have a beginning and an end.

26
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:28,070
They're medium to long term.

27
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:31,627
They are focused activities and that's what we covered in the

28
00:01:31,627 --> 00:01:34,070
previous module and now we're onto initiatives.

29
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:38,000
Longer-term strategies, they drive large projects.

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,090
Consume large resource commitments.

31
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:46,060
This module is all about the work management for initiatives.

32
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:49,080
Here are the key topics we'll be covering in this module.

33
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,020
Initiative work management, why?

34
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,020
A portfolio management office.

35
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:56,070
Portfolio management office processes.

36
00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:02,040
Portfolio management office workflow, governance, designing portfolios.

37
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:05,050
Help programs support initiative work management

38
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:07,020
and an organizational viewpoint.

39
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:13,000
Now let's dive into the Initiative Work Management process and the Portfolio Management Office.
