Hello, I'm Michael Krasowski from Pluralsight.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,583
I will be presenting the overview module in the course Demand

3
00:00:08,583 --> 00:00:12,020
and Work Management: A Practical Guide.

4
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:14,050
Let's get started.

5
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:18,060
Have you ever asked yourself: Do I need more people?

6
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,010
Seems like I have too much to do.

7
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:23,020
Am I working on the right stuff?

8
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:25,070
Everything seems important.

9
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:30,030
Am I getting the right guidance from my customers, managers, and stakeholders?

10
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,030
Do I need to hire more with new skill sets,

11
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:36,020
maybe more leadership-type people as well?

12
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:39,000
How am I going to get this done?

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,050
What is the best way to do the work that I have?

14
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:44,010
What's the priority?

15
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:47,060
Everyone is saying do mine first.

16
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:49,050
Is there visibility to what I'm doing?

17
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:52,259
Can others see my list of work to do and see my

18
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:55,010
progress on the work that I'm doing?

19
00:00:55,010 --> 00:01:00,010
Or conversely, have you ever been asked these questions by others?

20
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:03,030
And if you have, did you struggle with the answers?

21
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:05,000
Well, you are not alone.

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,090
Most people do struggle.

23
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:11,040
And a major client of mine, the senior vice president told one of his directors,

24
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,060
"You will get the resources you need.

25
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:17,676
"Just give me the business case "or show me some data or something.

26
00:01:17,676 --> 00:01:22,030
" Since the director had no written list or backlog of work

27
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:25,050
and no way to status and track his work,

28
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:27,080
he was unable to get resources.

29
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,070
Yes, he did need them,

30
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:35,040
but any reasonably qualified senior manager must act on good solid data,

31
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,813
not just, "Gee, I'm really, really busy; can I hire?

32
00:01:37,813 --> 00:01:48,000
" Sorry, that doesn't work for me either. Now, let's find out just why you are here watching my course.
