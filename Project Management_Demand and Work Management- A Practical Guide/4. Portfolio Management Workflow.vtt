1
00:00:00.793 --> 00:00:04.076
We will now review the portfolio management workflow and the

2
00:00:04.076 --> 00:00:07.833
importance of the executive governance body.

3
00:00:07.833 --> 00:00:10.843
Like to reinforce again why we are doing this.

4
00:00:10.843 --> 00:00:11.964
Without the PMO,

5
00:00:11.964 --> 00:00:15.629
the business tends to believe that the ultimate goal

6
00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:17.873
is to achieve project success.

7
00:00:17.873 --> 00:00:22.424
Yet it is found that many projects do not fit well with the strategic

8
00:00:22.424 --> 00:00:25.873
initiatives and hence do not represent the best use of resources.

9
00:00:25.873 --> 00:00:28.793
So basically the term does not fit well,

10
00:00:28.793 --> 00:00:30.833
really means to either stop the project,

11
00:00:30.833 --> 00:00:34.853
maybe reduce the resources or merge portions with other projects.

12
00:00:34.853 --> 00:00:39.863
I want to emphasize this since management seems reticent to stop projects.

13
00:00:39.863 --> 00:00:43.983
Remember the ultimate goal is the best allocation of resources,

14
00:00:43.983 --> 00:00:46.833
and maximizing the investment dollar.

15
00:00:46.833 --> 00:00:50.863
Okay, onto a workflow example.

16
00:00:50.863 --> 00:00:54.843
Here is an example of a simple workflow of portfolio management.

17
00:00:54.843 --> 00:00:58.803
You could use this as a starting point and then modify to meet your needs.

18
00:00:58.803 --> 00:01:02.039
First you need to identify and gather the executives you

19
00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.833
need to form your executive Steering Group.

20
00:01:03.833 --> 00:01:09.783
They should be members of the C-suite, like the CEO, CFO, COO et cetera.

21
00:01:09.783 --> 00:01:14.305
Plus you want to have the CIO and the CTO as members as well and of

22
00:01:14.305 --> 00:01:16.813
course anyone else that makes sense to join the team.

23
00:01:16.813 --> 00:01:19.813
From that team you will identify and itemize your key

24
00:01:19.813 --> 00:01:21.813
strategic initiatives and projects,

25
00:01:21.813 --> 00:01:24.853
with corresponding data such as business case outcome goals,

26
00:01:24.853 --> 00:01:26.863
target ROI and things like that.

27
00:01:26.863 --> 00:01:31.846
Then your PMO executive team may be some of the same players or a subset,

28
00:01:31.846 --> 00:01:34.982
will follow the governance to find and filter through

29
00:01:34.982 --> 00:01:36.863
the initiative and project proposals.

30
00:01:36.863 --> 00:01:40.843
The results of which is the initiative and project backlog.

31
00:01:40.843 --> 00:01:43.629
The portfolio reviews will groom the backlog,

32
00:01:43.629 --> 00:01:47.457
add new items and discuss feedback from ongoing initiatives and

33
00:01:47.457 --> 00:01:49.863
projects and I'll show you more of that in a moment.

34
00:01:49.863 --> 00:01:51.853
If a project is approved.

35
00:01:51.853 --> 00:01:55.175
We will make a resource allocation and launch a new

36
00:01:55.175 --> 00:01:56.853
project to support an initiative,

37
00:01:56.853 --> 00:02:00.203
or maybe we have to adjust the resource allocation for

38
00:02:00.203 --> 00:02:03.803
an existing initiative or project, either up or down.

39
00:02:03.803 --> 00:02:08.793
Next is portfolio X, which is a container of either projects,

40
00:02:08.793 --> 00:02:10.833
programs and our operations.

41
00:02:10.833 --> 00:02:15.494
There would be a container for each initiative as a way to display it to the

42
00:02:15.494 --> 00:02:18.863
executives or your governance body for easy status reporting.

43
00:02:18.863 --> 00:02:22.863
Now as you can see in this example we have four projects.

44
00:02:22.863 --> 00:02:25.813
Two are going good and are green.

45
00:02:25.813 --> 00:02:29.803
One is red, so that is an issue we need to drill in on,

46
00:02:29.803 --> 00:02:31.783
and project four is yellow.

47
00:02:31.783 --> 00:02:34.166
Now we still may want to drill in on that but we hope that

48
00:02:34.166 --> 00:02:36.793
project is going okay and can be corrected.

49
00:02:36.793 --> 00:02:39.466
Also we have two operational areas,

50
00:02:39.466 --> 00:02:43.645
one and two and again they would reflect actual pieces of the

51
00:02:43.645 --> 00:02:48.044
organization that exists and will likely continue to exist versus

52
00:02:48.044 --> 00:02:49.873
projects that have a start and end,

53
00:02:49.873 --> 00:02:53.570
and in this case there is synergy and a working relationship

54
00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:57.798
between project one and operational area one and between

55
00:02:57.798 --> 00:03:01.803
project two and operational two, and that's why I wanted to show it that way.

56
00:03:01.803 --> 00:03:05.820
So our portfolio project or program managers of those

57
00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.853
projects and operational areas, will be feeding information.

58
00:03:08.853 --> 00:03:12.293
That is decision metrics such as value, costs,

59
00:03:12.293 --> 00:03:13.793
risk et cetera,

60
00:03:13.793 --> 00:03:18.853
back to the executive PMO governance for periodic portfolio reviews.

61
00:03:18.853 --> 00:03:22.873
Also you will notice that the communication in this area is bi-directional.

62
00:03:22.873 --> 00:03:23.613
Information,

63
00:03:23.613 --> 00:03:27.818
guidance and decision-making will flow up and down

64
00:03:27.818 --> 00:03:29.803
this chain of responsible parties.

65
00:03:29.803 --> 00:03:31.853
Now let's talk more about executive governance,

66
00:03:31.853 --> 00:03:35.853
which is where I'm now highlighting.

67
00:03:35.853 --> 00:03:39.384
Now let's see who we'd like to have participate in the

68
00:03:39.384 --> 00:03:40.863
executive governance body or team.

69
00:03:40.863 --> 00:03:43.504
You want to be sure you populate the body with key

70
00:03:43.504 --> 00:03:45.853
executives from all parts of the organization.

71
00:03:45.853 --> 00:03:49.298
These are the leaders of the company and are ultimately

72
00:03:49.298 --> 00:03:51.803
responsible for the success of the company as well.

73
00:03:51.803 --> 00:03:53.873
They can come from the board, Steering Groups,

74
00:03:53.873 --> 00:03:58.783
senior executives, and just important business leaders in your organization.

75
00:03:58.783 --> 00:04:01.619
Now let's talk about what we expect from these leaders to

76
00:04:01.619 --> 00:04:06.843
make governance and the PMO even work.

77
00:04:06.843 --> 00:04:09.863
The executive role in PMO governance.

78
00:04:09.863 --> 00:04:13.863
Executives or senior managers are busy people, well who isn't?

79
00:04:13.863 --> 00:04:16.793
But sometimes your attention span is short.

80
00:04:16.793 --> 00:04:19.840
So you will need to sit them down and educate them on what you

81
00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.793
expect from them to jumpstart this activity,

82
00:04:22.793 --> 00:04:24.863
and here's a short checklist on what you need to do.

83
00:04:24.863 --> 00:04:27.863
You want to have them avoid informal decisions.

84
00:04:27.863 --> 00:04:31.863
Basically do not launch projects outside of the process and governance.

85
00:04:31.863 --> 00:04:35.664
Sometimes executives or managers are targets of those in the

86
00:04:35.664 --> 00:04:37.793
organization seeking support and funding.

87
00:04:37.793 --> 00:04:40.873
This is not good since it redirects monies away from critical initiatives.

88
00:04:40.873 --> 00:04:43.803
You want to have them avoid pet projects.

89
00:04:43.803 --> 00:04:47.803
If a project is tied too closely to only one executive or manager,

90
00:04:47.803 --> 00:04:49.793
they may not be as objective.

91
00:04:49.793 --> 00:04:52.873
Remember the full team makes decisions, not just one member.

92
00:04:52.873 --> 00:04:56.873
Now of course if the CEO is on the team and he or she has a pet project,

93
00:04:56.873 --> 00:04:58.863
well it's likely to get done.

94
00:04:58.863 --> 00:05:00.803
Okay, that's life.

95
00:05:00.803 --> 00:05:03.863
Now also have them follow the governance process.

96
00:05:03.863 --> 00:05:05.843
Don't work outside the process.

97
00:05:05.843 --> 00:05:08.833
If people go around the process, why even have one?

98
00:05:08.833 --> 00:05:12.333
If the process needs to be changed, recommend changes,

99
00:05:12.333 --> 00:05:15.833
get consensus, update the process and move on.

100
00:05:15.833 --> 00:05:17.873
Think in terms of investment management.

101
00:05:17.873 --> 00:05:21.793
The team is determining how best to spend their investment dollars

102
00:05:21.793 --> 00:05:24.793
for the future of the organization or the company,

103
00:05:24.793 --> 00:05:26.853
and lastly work as a team.

104
00:05:26.853 --> 00:05:29.843
The strength of a team is each individual member.

105
00:05:29.843 --> 00:05:32.863
So take time and care in selecting the right members.

106
00:05:32.863 --> 00:05:42.000
The strength of each member, well, is of course the team. In the next section we'll look at ideas of how we may design our portfolios.
