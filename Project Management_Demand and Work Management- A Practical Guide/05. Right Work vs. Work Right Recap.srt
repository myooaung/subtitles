1
00:00:00,294 --> 00:00:06,224
Now let's recap right work versus work right.

2
00:00:06,224 --> 00:00:12,254
Demand management is all about determining and selecting the right work to do.

3
00:00:12,254 --> 00:00:16,244
And work management is all about literally doing the work in the right way.

4
00:00:16,244 --> 00:00:18,585
That is following the best practices, standards,

5
00:00:18,585 --> 00:00:21,284
and tools that your company or organization adopts

6
00:00:21,284 --> 00:00:25,314
in order to carry out your work.

7
00:00:25,314 --> 00:00:29,625
Our key work management types are operations... Again,

8
00:00:29,625 --> 00:00:32,294
that's on-going work, short verse of activity,

9
00:00:32,294 --> 00:00:35,314
made right projects, and you have to have a lot of business domain.

10
00:00:35,314 --> 00:00:37,234
Next is project.

11
00:00:37,234 --> 00:00:39,264
Remember, projects have a beginning and an end.

12
00:00:39,264 --> 00:00:42,294
They're may be in the long term, and they're very focused activities.

13
00:00:42,294 --> 00:00:46,774
And initiatives are long-term strategies that drive large

14
00:00:46,774 --> 00:00:49,254
projects and require large resource commitments.

15
00:00:49,254 --> 00:00:52,304
And they are very important to the success of a company.

16
00:00:52,304 --> 00:00:55,314
Now, they each have their own process for demand management,

17
00:00:55,314 --> 00:00:55,972
though similar,

18
00:00:55,972 --> 00:00:59,378
and they each have their own processes for getting

19
00:00:59,378 --> 00:01:03,244
the work done in the right way.

20
00:01:03,244 --> 00:01:05,284
We focused on demand first in this course,

21
00:01:05,284 --> 00:01:08,294
so you can see the distinction between demand and work,

22
00:01:08,294 --> 00:01:12,294
and that demand is the process of selecting the right work.

23
00:01:12,294 --> 00:01:15,510
Then we discuss the work management processes for operations,

24
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:17,304
projects, and initiatives.

25
00:01:17,304 --> 00:01:18,291
In actuality,

26
00:01:18,291 --> 00:01:23,686
demand and work should be one integrated and continuous overall

27
00:01:23,686 --> 00:01:28,244
process with subprocesses for each work type.

28
00:01:28,244 --> 00:01:31,234
Yet I also want you to know that at a macro level,

29
00:01:31,234 --> 00:01:38,244
demand and work are one big process and should be tightly integrated.

30
00:01:38,244 --> 00:01:41,254
IT has a pretty challenging balancing act, in my opinion.

31
00:01:41,254 --> 00:01:47,712
74% of senior IT leaders say it is challenging to balance business initiatives,

32
00:01:47,712 --> 00:01:51,594
innovation, products, services, very disruptive,

33
00:01:51,594 --> 00:01:53,234
with operations.

34
00:01:53,234 --> 00:01:53,494
Therefore,

35
00:01:53,494 --> 00:01:56,287
you need a really good structuring process to manage

36
00:01:56,287 --> 00:01:59,050
demand and work management for operations,

37
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:06,000
projects, and initiatives like you've seen in this course. Now let's move on to recapping demand management.
