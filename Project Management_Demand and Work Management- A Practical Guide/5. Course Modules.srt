00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:03,919
Here are the course modules.

2
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:07,909
First, we're going to explore the fundamentals of demand management.

3
00:00:07,909 --> 00:00:11,919
Then, construct your demand and management process.

4
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:15,909
Next, building your operations management process.

5
00:00:15,909 --> 00:00:20,849
Next, building your project management process.

6
00:00:20,849 --> 00:00:24,869
And next, building your initiative management process.

7
00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:28,919
And lastly will be the course summary and a recap of your understanding.

8
00:00:28,919 --> 00:00:32,899
Now here is an interesting quote.

9
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:39,889
"All things are in a state of flux" by the Greek philosopher Heraclitus.

10
00:00:39,889 --> 00:00:44,298
Can you imagine he was way out ahead of his time and he

11
00:00:44,298 --> 00:00:46,859
was way out ahead of agile methodology, like,

12
00:00:46,859 --> 00:00:49,829
by 2500 years?

13
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:51,889
Because we know that change is constant,

14
00:00:51,889 --> 00:00:55,919
all of our processes, by which we manage any sort of systems development,

15
00:00:55,919 --> 00:00:59,859
must be able to adapt to change.

16
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:02,859
Don't fight change, embrace it.

17
00:01:02,859 --> 00:01:05,909
We talk about following the agile process to write software.

18
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:10,879
Well, let's follow the agile, AKA, adaptive process,

19
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:15,899
to manage our demand or work intake, and also the work itself.

20
00:01:15,899 --> 00:01:16,404
Lastly,

21
00:01:16,404 --> 00:01:21,899
Heraclitus was famous for his insistence on ever present changes

22
00:01:21,899 --> 00:01:25,869
being the fundamental essence of the universe.

23
00:01:25,869 --> 00:01:26,899
And so, it is.

24
00:01:26,899 --> 00:01:35,000
Change is all around us. Okay, now let's see what demand is all about in the next module.
