1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:04,500
Now let's recap operations work management.

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,480
Here are the key concepts for operations management.

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:12,289
The role of operations: make it as easy as possible for your

4
00:00:12,289 --> 00:00:14,410
customers to maximize their productivity.

5
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:16,460
You exist to service your customers.

6
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:18,480
Operations work management process.

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,467
In my opinion,

8
00:00:19,467 --> 00:00:23,480
you must have a ticketing process as the core way to manage your work.

9
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:27,450
Design it, build it, get buy in from your team and customers,

10
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:30,420
and use it and improve the process overtime.

11
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:31,420
Why Kanban?

12
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:32,470
Because it's just great.

13
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:35,420
It is an easy technique, highly visible,

14
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:38,470
simple to comprehend, yield in great results.

15
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:41,410
We also talked about Sprint versus Kanban.

16
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:42,470
Now, in a nutshell with Sprint,

17
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:46,440
the deliverables are determined by a sprint or a set periods of time.

18
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:51,430
And with Kanban, work is delivered continuously in an as needed basis.

19
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:53,490
The importance of quality triage.

20
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:54,619
With quality triaging,

21
00:00:54,619 --> 00:00:59,943
your developers and QA teams will appreciate complete bug tickets that has

22
00:00:59,943 --> 00:01:02,470
all the information that is there and then they correct it.

23
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:04,500
And the product will have a deeper understanding

24
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,470
about the health of their system.

25
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:08,450
Organizing operations.

26
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:11,410
So which is the best way to organize your team?

27
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:12,490
There is no one right answer,

28
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:15,788
but I wanted you to be aware of the numerous approaches of

29
00:01:15,788 --> 00:01:17,480
structuring your app support organization.

30
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:20,420
And lastly, organizational dynamics.

31
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:22,460
Be vigilant and look for opportunities.

32
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:24,470
New hires may drive possibilities.

33
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:27,490
Also rotate people through different roles and make

34
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:29,470
customer service an absolute.

35
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:33,430
Now let's review Kanban.

36
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:34,490
Here is a Kanban board.

37
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:36,490
We have three columns in this case.

38
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:39,420
We have the To Do column on the left.

39
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:42,430
Middle column Doing, that's the work in progress.

40
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:44,440
And the last column is the Done column.

41
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:48,450
The To Do column of course is our backlog, those are things we need to do.

42
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:51,410
We will review those items on the left column,

43
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:54,480
approve them to be work, then we would move the card into the Doing column.

44
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:58,410
After we complete the work, we would move the card into the Done column.

45
00:01:58,410 --> 00:01:59,004
And as I've mentioned,

46
00:01:59,004 --> 00:02:02,440
you can add as many columns as you want to simulate

47
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:10,000
any kind of workflow you have. Very easy, very powerful tool to use, highly recommended.
