1
00:00:01,006 --> 00:00:03,056
Understanding demand types.

2
00:00:03,056 --> 00:00:09,738
So, no matter what your demand type is you will always need to collect,

3
00:00:09,738 --> 00:00:15,986
organize, track, and prioritize your demand prior to doing any work.

4
00:00:15,986 --> 00:00:18,046
Now, let's see what they are.

5
00:00:18,046 --> 00:00:23,673
For this course, I'm going to simplify and categorize all demand,

6
00:00:23,673 --> 00:00:29,276
that is work you're asked to do, into three categories: operations,

7
00:00:29,276 --> 00:00:33,056
projects, and initiatives.

8
00:00:33,056 --> 00:00:36,036
So, what I am saying, in my opinion,

9
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:44,026
is that 99% of all demand and work will fall into one of these broad categories.

10
00:00:44,026 --> 00:00:44,280
Now,

11
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:50,016
each category will be handled and managed at a macro level pretty much the same,

12
00:00:50,016 --> 00:00:53,046
but, at a detailed level, somewhat differently.

13
00:00:53,046 --> 00:00:59,006
Therefore, I have modeled this entire course around these three demand types,

14
00:00:59,006 --> 00:01:03,996
and later, correspondingly, the same for work types as well.

15
00:01:03,996 --> 00:01:08,986
Now, let's compare each one to better understand the differences.

16
00:01:08,986 --> 00:01:09,983
For this course,

17
00:01:09,983 --> 00:01:13,986
I'm going to simplify and categorize all demand and work

18
00:01:13,986 --> 00:01:17,001
into three general categories: operations,

19
00:01:17,001 --> 00:01:20,016
projects, and initiatives.

20
00:01:20,016 --> 00:01:23,323
To better understand just what I mean by the term,

21
00:01:23,323 --> 00:01:28,976
operations, here are a few characteristics: day-to-day functions of the business,

22
00:01:28,976 --> 00:01:32,594
keeps the lights on, like a utility company,

23
00:01:32,594 --> 00:01:37,056
you just expect it to work, issues are formally tracked in a tracking system,

24
00:01:37,056 --> 00:01:43,016
such as Jira, or others, typically smaller units of work,

25
00:01:43,016 --> 00:01:47,046
always running, sometimes even seven by 24.

26
00:01:47,046 --> 00:01:49,755
To better understand just what I mean by the term,

27
00:01:49,755 --> 00:01:55,046
projects, here are a few characteristics: projects drive new revenues,

28
00:01:55,046 --> 00:02:00,036
supports existing products or services, drives cost containment,

29
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:03,986
has a maybe higher level management focus,

30
00:02:03,986 --> 00:02:07,046
it's typically more of a medium level of effort,

31
00:02:07,046 --> 00:02:10,066
and has a distinct beginning and end.

32
00:02:10,066 --> 00:02:13,046
It's not ongoing like operations.

33
00:02:13,046 --> 00:02:16,359
To better understand just what I mean by the term,

34
00:02:16,359 --> 00:02:16,807
initiatives,

35
00:02:16,807 --> 00:02:21,516
here are a few characteristics: initiatives propel a

36
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:26,986
company forward strategically, they are large-scale activities,

37
00:02:26,986 --> 00:02:29,996
major new products or services,

38
00:02:29,996 --> 00:02:34,036
and an executive focus rather than a mid-management focus,

39
00:02:34,036 --> 00:02:39,041
and also typically very large activities in terms of resources,

40
00:02:39,041 --> 00:02:41,066
people, and money required.

41
00:02:41,066 --> 00:02:46,036
Also, long term outcomes, maybe even a year to three years.

42
00:02:46,036 --> 00:02:50,066
Now you may have a better sense of my three major demand and work types.

43
00:02:50,066 --> 00:02:53,709
It is important to understand these types since how you handle

44
00:02:53,709 --> 00:02:56,006
the demand for your products or services,

45
00:02:56,006 --> 00:03:00,006
and how you will ultimately handle the work-side are different.

46
00:03:00,006 --> 00:03:02,996
Let's see some examples.

47
00:03:02,996 --> 00:03:05,976
Here are a few demand type examples.

48
00:03:05,976 --> 00:03:06,836
For operations,

49
00:03:06,836 --> 00:03:10,686
a simple example may be add an additional drop down

50
00:03:10,686 --> 00:03:13,986
values for healthcare application types.

51
00:03:13,986 --> 00:03:14,541
For projects,

52
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:19,236
a simple example may be add a new module to enable users to

53
00:03:19,236 --> 00:03:21,986
fill out healthcare applications online.

54
00:03:21,986 --> 00:03:22,846
For initiatives,

55
00:03:22,846 --> 00:03:29,026
a simple example may be develop a new healthcare paperless application system.

56
00:03:29,026 --> 00:03:33,672
Yes, these are simple examples, but hopefully they convey a relative size,

57
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:36,036
complexity, and level of effort.

58
00:03:36,036 --> 00:03:37,986
Speaking of level of effort,

59
00:03:37,986 --> 00:03:46,000
let's be sure we are on the same page on that term's definition on the next slide.
