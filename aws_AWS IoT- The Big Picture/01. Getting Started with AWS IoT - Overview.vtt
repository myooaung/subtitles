00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.699
Hello, and welcome back.

2
00:00:02.699 --> 00:00:05.573
This is Fernando Medina Corey and in this module we'll be

3
00:00:05.573 --> 00:00:09.425
looking at Getting Started with AWS IoT.

4
00:00:09.425 --> 00:00:11.585
In this module, we'll be taking a look at two areas.

5
00:00:11.585 --> 00:00:14.135
The first will be device software.

6
00:00:14.135 --> 00:00:16.587
We'll be looking at things like Amazon FreeRTOS,

7
00:00:16.587 --> 00:00:21.796
Amazon IoT Greengrass, and AWS IoT Device SDK.

8
00:00:21.796 --> 00:00:24.548
And each of these areas will allow us to understand more about the software

9
00:00:24.548 --> 00:00:28.710
that runs on IoT devices when we're interacting with AWS IoT.

10
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.615
Now after that, we'll take a look at some management services,

11
00:00:33.615 --> 00:00:35.698
specifically we'll look at the Device Gateway,

12
00:00:35.698 --> 00:00:39.803
which will help us manage connections into AWS IoT and out of it,

13
00:00:39.803 --> 00:00:42.580
we'll also look at authentication and authorization and how

14
00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.124
AWS IoT handles both of those processes.

15
00:00:45.124 --> 00:00:47.024
We'll look at the Thing Registry,

16
00:00:47.024 --> 00:00:51.698
so how we can register our different IoT things and devices in order

17
00:00:51.698 --> 00:00:53.270
to keep track of them and manage them effectively,

18
00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.222
as well as the Fleet Indexing Service to allow us to take some of the

19
00:00:57.222 --> 00:01:00.209
information about out things and effectively index it and search

20
00:01:00.209 --> 00:01:02.494
through it when we need to do different tasks,

21
00:01:02.494 --> 00:01:05.191
like finding various devices.

22
00:01:05.191 --> 00:01:06.679
We'll also look at the Jobs Service,

23
00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:09.256
which will help us deal with our devices after we've already sent

24
00:01:09.256 --> 00:01:12.933
applications out to them and maybe we want to update them or take

25
00:01:12.933 --> 00:01:14.719
different changes on those devices.

26
00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:16.368
After that, we'll look at Device Defender,

27
00:01:16.368 --> 00:01:20.631
which will help us both audit and secure our devices from attacks or

28
00:01:20.631 --> 00:01:23.984
potential misconfigurations that we may accidentally leave.

29
00:01:23.984 --> 00:01:27.711
Now in addition to Device Defender, we'll also look at some AWS IoT jargon,

30
00:01:27.711 --> 00:01:30.746
just so we can kind of understand the broader picture around a few

31
00:01:30.746 --> 00:01:33.762
different terms that get thrown around in relation to AWS IoT.

32
00:01:33.762 --> 00:01:41.000
So I'll go ahead and see you in the next video and we'll get started taking a look at some device software.
