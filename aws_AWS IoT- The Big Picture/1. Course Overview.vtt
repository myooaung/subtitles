Hi everyone, my name is Fernando Medina Corey,

2
00:00:08.476 --> 00:00:12.220
and welcome to my course AWS IoT: The Big Picture.

3
00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:17.094
I currently work as a cloud architect at Stormlight Consulting, LLC.

4
00:00:17.094 --> 00:00:21.278
And I've previously used AWS as a data engineer and software developer.

5
00:00:21.278 --> 00:00:24.381
I also currently hold six AWS certifications and have made

6
00:00:24.381 --> 00:00:28.227
courses that span dozens of AWS services.

7
00:00:28.227 --> 00:00:31.305
This course is a high level overview of all the

8
00:00:31.305 --> 00:00:33.728
components of AWS's IoT offering.

9
00:00:33.728 --> 00:00:36.801
With billions of IoT devices being added to the market every year,

10
00:00:36.801 --> 00:00:39.645
you'll want to be prepared to benefit from what some are

11
00:00:39.645 --> 00:00:42.809
calling the fourth industrial revolution.

12
00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.156
Some of the major topics that we'll cover include

13
00:00:45.156 --> 00:00:50.746
IoT risks and responsibilities, leveraging custom software for IoT devices,

14
00:00:50.746 --> 00:00:54.603
AWS IoT services to help us build and secure our applications,

15
00:00:54.603 --> 00:00:59.149
and how we could integrate our IoT applications with other AWS services.

16
00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:01.340
By the end of this course,

17
00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.865
you'll know enough about the Internet of Things and the AWS IoT

18
00:01:04.865 --> 00:01:08.687
Service Suite to plan out your first IoT applications and

19
00:01:08.687 --> 00:01:11.748
understand any IoT jargon you might encounter.

20
00:01:11.748 --> 00:01:12.897
Before beginning this course,

21
00:01:12.897 --> 00:01:15.191
you should probably be familiar with cloud computing and

22
00:01:15.191 --> 00:01:18.699
potentially know a little bit about AWS itself.

23
00:01:18.699 --> 00:01:19.148
From here,

24
00:01:19.148 --> 00:01:23.514
you should feel comfortable diving into other IoT and non-IoT AWS

25
00:01:23.514 --> 00:01:27.810
services with courses on particular AWS IoT services,

26
00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.185
AWS Lambda, or other foundational AWS courses.

27
00:01:32.185 --> 00:01:35.659
I hope you'll join me on this journey to learn AWS IoT

28
00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:43.000
with the AWS IoT: The Big Picture course, here at Pluralsight.
