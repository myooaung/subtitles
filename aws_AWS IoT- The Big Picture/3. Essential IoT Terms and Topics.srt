1
00:00:00,784 --> 00:00:02,890
So now that we have a high level understanding of how IoT

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:06,023
works and some segments that IoT falls within,

3
00:00:06,023 --> 00:00:09,119
let's take a look at some specific terminology that we'll need to

4
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:12,077
know when we're working with the Internet of Things.

5
00:00:12,077 --> 00:00:16,329
Let's get started by talking about smart and connected devices, or things.

6
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:19,150
Now this is kind of a more generic term that could apply to

7
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:22,486
anything from watches to thermostats to dishwashers.

8
00:00:22,486 --> 00:00:26,127
But when I'm talking about things in the context of AWS later on,

9
00:00:26,127 --> 00:00:27,941
specifically AWS IoT things,

10
00:00:27,941 --> 00:00:31,118
I'm not only talking about those devices that we

11
00:00:31,118 --> 00:00:32,972
mentioned that are smart or connected,

12
00:00:32,972 --> 00:00:35,826
but I'm specifically talking about a representation of a

13
00:00:35,826 --> 00:00:37,414
specific device or logical entity.

14
00:00:37,414 --> 00:00:42,283
Now this is taken directly from the AWS developer documentation.

15
00:00:42,283 --> 00:00:43,191
And when we're talking about this,

16
00:00:43,191 --> 00:00:45,719
it could be anything from an application instance,

17
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:48,637
so not just maybe a thermostat or a dishwasher,

18
00:00:48,637 --> 00:00:51,484
but an actual application that's running somewhere in the cloud or on-premises,

19
00:00:51,484 --> 00:00:55,311
but also things like physical entities that are related

20
00:00:55,311 --> 00:00:58,546
to devices that connect to AWS IoT, but they don't connect themselves.

21
00:00:58,546 --> 00:01:03,007
So if we're thinking about this in the context of that car I mentioned earlier,

22
00:01:03,007 --> 00:01:05,748
this could maybe be an engine inside of the car,

23
00:01:05,748 --> 00:01:09,084
which is a physical entity that's related to the car,

24
00:01:09,084 --> 00:01:12,384
but that engine itself might not actually connect to AWS IoT.

25
00:01:12,384 --> 00:01:15,444
It might send information to the car and that car maybe

26
00:01:15,444 --> 00:01:18,764
would then send information up to AWS IoT.

27
00:01:18,764 --> 00:01:21,226
So now let's fill in a few more missing components of this

28
00:01:21,226 --> 00:01:24,011
larger diagram of how IoT things work.

29
00:01:24,011 --> 00:01:26,879
Now specifically, I talked about those devices,

30
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:29,804
but let's take a little bit of a step back and start thinking about

31
00:01:29,804 --> 00:01:33,701
different sensors that might exist on those devices and inputs that

32
00:01:33,701 --> 00:01:36,085
might come into those devices themselves.

33
00:01:36,085 --> 00:01:38,054
Now one of the first ones might be things like

34
00:01:38,054 --> 00:01:40,130
thermometers that check different temperatures.

35
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:41,577
You might also have things like motion sensors,

36
00:01:41,577 --> 00:01:44,165
which determine whether or not some motion is there,

37
00:01:44,165 --> 00:01:47,803
or device inputs that come directly from some physical device.

38
00:01:47,803 --> 00:01:50,785
This could either be things like touch or other device inputs

39
00:01:50,785 --> 00:01:53,896
that maybe come from an ambient environment.

40
00:01:53,896 --> 00:01:56,595
Now another thing I wanted to point out is there could be device states,

41
00:01:56,595 --> 00:01:58,305
such as locked or unlocked,

42
00:01:58,305 --> 00:02:01,290
and different devices might have actuators inside of them,

43
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:04,702
which essentially allow you to do things with those devices,

44
00:02:04,702 --> 00:02:08,825
and they might report on the state of those actuators inside the devices.

45
00:02:08,825 --> 00:02:12,881
Now these could be things like locks or levers or manufacturing equipment,

46
00:02:12,881 --> 00:02:16,233
and all of these might be things that might feed data into an

47
00:02:16,233 --> 00:02:19,155
environment or might require some input from outside of the

48
00:02:19,155 --> 00:02:22,099
environment to actually change and so stuff with.

49
00:02:22,099 --> 00:02:24,014
So let's go ahead and actually take another closer

50
00:02:24,014 --> 00:02:26,757
look at how these IoT things work.

51
00:02:26,757 --> 00:02:27,084
Specifically,

52
00:02:27,084 --> 00:02:31,774
let's look at these IoT devices and how sensor inputs might come into them.

53
00:02:31,774 --> 00:02:33,576
So inside of these devices,

54
00:02:33,576 --> 00:02:37,290
we might have a lock or a speedometer or maybe a control

55
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:39,473
attached to manufacturing equipment.

56
00:02:39,473 --> 00:02:42,976
Now each of these different things would then connect to the device

57
00:02:42,976 --> 00:02:46,035
and these devices would then need to use some communication protocol

58
00:02:46,035 --> 00:02:47,954
to actually send information around.

59
00:02:47,954 --> 00:02:51,274
And when we're talking about these communication protocols,

60
00:02:51,274 --> 00:02:52,691
we might be talking about things like Wi-Fi,

61
00:02:52,691 --> 00:02:57,988
but we could also be talking about other protocols like Bluetooth or 3G or 4G,

62
00:02:57,988 --> 00:03:02,383
and there's many others that might come into play because the communication

63
00:03:02,383 --> 00:03:07,029
protocols that we use with IoT can be substantially more varied than the ones

64
00:03:07,029 --> 00:03:09,266
we're used to just when we're using our laptops,

65
00:03:09,266 --> 00:03:10,326
for example.

66
00:03:10,326 --> 00:03:12,050
Those might all be tuned to Wi-Fi,

67
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:16,132
whereas these other devices might have other protocols for the various

68
00:03:16,132 --> 00:03:19,390
situations that might come up to leverage those more effectively.

69
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:21,977
So after these protocols get involved,

70
00:03:21,977 --> 00:03:24,103
the ones that are going to connect to the internet eventually

71
00:03:24,103 --> 00:03:27,117
would probably do so and then be sent over to maybe a cloud

72
00:03:27,117 --> 00:03:30,372
provider to send that information that's generated up there or

73
00:03:30,372 --> 00:03:31,742
retrieve information from it.

74
00:03:31,742 --> 00:03:34,392
There might also be information that's send over the

75
00:03:34,392 --> 00:03:36,648
internet to an on-premises environment.

76
00:03:36,648 --> 00:03:38,741
However, again, like the example we mentioned earlier,

77
00:03:38,741 --> 00:03:42,446
it could just be that that device is kept within the on-premises

78
00:03:42,446 --> 00:03:45,293
environment and never really sent out through the open internet.

79
00:03:45,293 --> 00:03:47,050
So now that you understand there's this

80
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:49,858
communications protocol layer in between,

81
00:03:49,858 --> 00:03:53,350
let's take a quick look at some different protocols that we might interact with.

82
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:55,261
Now this will be really quick so we don't have to

83
00:03:55,261 --> 00:03:56,869
dive into too much detail here,

84
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:59,758
but the language will be important for you to use later on.

85
00:03:59,758 --> 00:04:02,137
Now the first one, which you may already be familiar with,

86
00:04:02,137 --> 00:04:08,339
is 2G or 3G, which has long range and takes a relatively high amount of power.

87
00:04:08,339 --> 00:04:10,739
There's also Wi-Fi, which you should also be familiar with,

88
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:14,538
which is relatively medium range and medium power usage.

89
00:04:14,538 --> 00:04:16,198
But when you're trying to do things that save power,

90
00:04:16,198 --> 00:04:18,143
you might use protocols like Bluetooth,

91
00:04:18,143 --> 00:04:21,127
which have a smaller range and lower power usage,

92
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:23,809
or even things like near-field communications,

93
00:04:23,809 --> 00:04:25,123
or NFC,

94
00:04:25,123 --> 00:04:29,539
which has a very small range and low power usage because when you're using

95
00:04:29,539 --> 00:04:32,340
near-field communications and also thinking of things like RFID,

96
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:37,098
these things are going to be activated by some other scanner or

97
00:04:37,098 --> 00:04:39,608
power that's actually being brought next to them.

98
00:04:39,608 --> 00:04:43,210
So that's why it's not actually using any power until it's activated.

99
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:45,915
So in addition to these transport protocols where

100
00:04:45,915 --> 00:04:47,232
we're transporting information,

101
00:04:47,232 --> 00:04:51,627
there's also data protocols that kind of fit underneath that.

102
00:04:51,627 --> 00:04:53,114
And I won't dive into all the specifics here,

103
00:04:53,114 --> 00:04:56,294
but the terminology, again, is important to just be aware of.

104
00:04:56,294 --> 00:04:58,144
The first one of these protocols is MQTT,

105
00:04:58,144 --> 00:05:02,125
which is a lightweight publish and subscribe messaging model.

106
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:05,146
Now this will allow us to do things like see what different messages are

107
00:05:05,146 --> 00:05:08,763
coming from different channels and subscribe to those and also send messages

108
00:05:08,763 --> 00:05:12,184
out to channels so other devices and other people could subscribe to those

109
00:05:12,184 --> 00:05:14,538
bits of information for their applications.

110
00:05:14,538 --> 00:05:15,264
There's also Websocket,

111
00:05:15,264 --> 00:05:19,483
which is going to enable bi-directional web communications.

112
00:05:19,483 --> 00:05:21,747
Now this is going to allow you not only to send

113
00:05:21,747 --> 00:05:23,079
information from one point to another,

114
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:25,933
but it's also going to allow you to send information from

115
00:05:25,933 --> 00:05:29,531
that endpoint back to the original device and do that at the

116
00:05:29,531 --> 00:05:32,049
same time in an efficient manner.

117
00:05:32,049 --> 00:05:32,989
There's also HTTP,

118
00:05:32,989 --> 00:05:35,522
which you'll frequently see when you're working with web applications,

119
00:05:35,522 --> 00:05:39,269
and it's the traditional web application protocol that many of us are used to.

120
00:05:39,269 --> 00:05:42,066
Now these are just a few of the data protocols as well,

121
00:05:42,066 --> 00:05:43,869
but the main reason I'm including these,

122
00:05:43,869 --> 00:05:45,695
as well as the transport protocols,

123
00:05:45,695 --> 00:05:50,405
is because there's a lot of variety when it comes to protocols and IoT.

124
00:05:50,405 --> 00:05:52,636
You're not just getting the exact same stack that you're

125
00:05:52,636 --> 00:05:54,132
used to seeing in web applications.

126
00:05:54,132 --> 00:05:57,226
There's a lot of differences that are happening underneath the hood

127
00:05:57,226 --> 00:05:59,104
here when you're working with all these devices.

128
00:05:59,104 --> 00:06:02,395
So now that we have a better understanding of all of that terminology,

129
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:05,080
let's actually move on in the next video to start taking a

130
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:13,000
look at the purposes of IoT things and how we can use them for the benefit of our organizations.
