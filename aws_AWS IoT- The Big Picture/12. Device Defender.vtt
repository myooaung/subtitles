00:00:01.224 --> 00:00:05.793
Let's take a look at another critical management service, the Device Defender.

2
00:00:05.793 --> 00:00:08.608
The Device Defender is an IoT security service that allows you

3
00:00:08.608 --> 00:00:11.323
to audit the configuration of your devices,

4
00:00:11.323 --> 00:00:14.012
monitor connected devices to detect abnormal behavior,

5
00:00:14.012 --> 00:00:16.869
and to mitigate security risks.

6
00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:19.542
So what can we do with Device Defender?

7
00:00:19.542 --> 00:00:21.245
Well there's two categories of features to it.

8
00:00:21.245 --> 00:00:23.587
The first is the audit feature,

9
00:00:23.587 --> 00:00:26.433
and the audit feature is going to allow us to run the set of

10
00:00:26.433 --> 00:00:30.246
predefined checks to look for best practices with our IoT things

11
00:00:30.246 --> 00:00:33.066
and other configuration in our AWS account.

12
00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:35.022
There's also the detect feature.

13
00:00:35.022 --> 00:00:37.877
Now this is going to be used to detect anomalies that

14
00:00:37.877 --> 00:00:39.783
we ourselves configure and define.

15
00:00:39.783 --> 00:00:43.050
So let's take a closer look at each of these feature sets.

16
00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.288
Now let's start with the audit feature set.

17
00:00:45.288 --> 00:00:45.624
With auditing,

18
00:00:45.624 --> 00:00:49.408
we'll be able to check for a variety of different preconfigured checks,

19
00:00:49.408 --> 00:00:54.574
like things ranging from revoked certificates to overly permissive policies,

20
00:00:54.574 --> 00:00:56.391
or soon-to-be expiring certificates,

21
00:00:56.391 --> 00:00:59.688
or even devices that are reusing certificates to connect,

22
00:00:59.688 --> 00:01:04.294
and things like disabled logging where we might actually want that enabled to

23
00:01:04.294 --> 00:01:07.175
catch potential activity down the line that looks suspicious,

24
00:01:07.175 --> 00:01:10.057
or simply because we want to make sure we're collecting logs.

25
00:01:10.057 --> 00:01:13.217
Now there's other predefined checks that we could automatically run against

26
00:01:13.217 --> 00:01:16.718
our account to make sure we're in line with security best practices and

27
00:01:16.718 --> 00:01:20.698
just general best practices for our IoT things.

28
00:01:20.698 --> 00:01:22.407
Now on the other hand, we have detect.

29
00:01:22.407 --> 00:01:25.002
It's not going give us these preconfigured checks

30
00:01:25.002 --> 00:01:27.371
that align with best practices.

31
00:01:27.371 --> 00:01:27.516
Instead,

32
00:01:27.516 --> 00:01:31.123
we're going to be able to set up our own custom anomalies that we can

33
00:01:31.123 --> 00:01:35.517
define based on things like configuring IP deny or allow lists or

34
00:01:35.517 --> 00:01:39.054
looking at spikes in inbound or outbound traffic.

35
00:01:39.054 --> 00:01:42.374
And we can also take looks at the number of messages or the message size

36
00:01:42.374 --> 00:01:45.736
that is coming in and out of our devices or our account,

37
00:01:45.736 --> 00:01:47.542
as well as things like the number of authorization

38
00:01:47.542 --> 00:01:50.292
failures or unusual port listening activity.

39
00:01:50.292 --> 00:01:50.633
Finally,

40
00:01:50.633 --> 00:01:53.630
we could also look at things like the number of active

41
00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.576
connections or connection attempts.

42
00:01:55.576 --> 00:01:59.634
Now these are just some of the metrics that detect provides us so that we can

43
00:01:59.634 --> 00:02:03.529
configure our own anomalies in our account and that is just determined based

44
00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:08.337
on what we think suspicious IP addresses or maybe what we think unusual

45
00:02:08.337 --> 00:02:11.113
message sizes or numbers of messages are.

46
00:02:11.113 --> 00:02:15.858
It's really up to us with detect to go ahead and configure that on our own,

47
00:02:15.858 --> 00:02:19.594
whereas with audit we can pick any of the predefined best

48
00:02:19.594 --> 00:02:25.000
practices to run against our account and let us know if we have any potential issues.
