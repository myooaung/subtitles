1
00:00:01,314 --> 00:00:03,442
So now that we have a lot of context about IoT generally,

2
00:00:03,442 --> 00:00:09,633
let's take a look at how AWS specifically fits in with our IoT needs.

3
00:00:09,633 --> 00:00:12,741
Now first let's ask the question, what does IoT require?

4
00:00:12,741 --> 00:00:14,356
Now we talked about this a little bit before,

5
00:00:14,356 --> 00:00:17,319
but we think it really starts with these devices.

6
00:00:17,319 --> 00:00:20,927
But on top of these devices, we need some sort of device software.

7
00:00:20,927 --> 00:00:24,538
Now this device software will allow us to interface with these devices and to

8
00:00:24,538 --> 00:00:27,598
do different things from the data that they're generating.

9
00:00:27,598 --> 00:00:30,135
Now in addition to this device software,

10
00:00:30,135 --> 00:00:33,103
we might need some management services to help us do things like

11
00:00:33,103 --> 00:00:37,626
secure those devices and also verify that the incoming information is

12
00:00:37,626 --> 00:00:39,549
from those specific devices authentically,

13
00:00:39,549 --> 00:00:42,495
and then doing things like integrating them into workflows and

14
00:00:42,495 --> 00:00:45,862
monitoring them both for security vulnerabilities and also just to

15
00:00:45,862 --> 00:00:48,137
make sure they're functioning as expected.

16
00:00:48,137 --> 00:00:49,820
Now in addition to these management services,

17
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:53,306
we also have other things we'll want to do to analyze

18
00:00:53,306 --> 00:00:55,530
and act on the data that is generated.

19
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:57,717
So these three different categories are what we'll be

20
00:00:57,717 --> 00:00:59,670
looking at later on this in course,

21
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:03,965
specifically related to AWS services that enable all of these areas.

22
00:01:03,965 --> 00:01:08,173
But let's take a look at some specific components of IoT so that we

23
00:01:08,173 --> 00:01:11,273
know exactly why we need these different services.

24
00:01:11,273 --> 00:01:11,487
First,

25
00:01:11,487 --> 00:01:14,538
we already have the devices and AWS isn't currently going to help us out

26
00:01:14,538 --> 00:01:18,126
there by providing us our own devices unless we're using things like an

27
00:01:18,126 --> 00:01:20,986
Amazon Dot or Alexa or things like that.

28
00:01:20,986 --> 00:01:24,975
Now in addition to these devices, we need the software that we just talked about.

29
00:01:24,975 --> 00:01:27,593
Then we might also need certificates to verify these devices

30
00:01:27,593 --> 00:01:30,899
to some sort of authorization provider so we know these

31
00:01:30,899 --> 00:01:33,162
devices are who they say they are.

32
00:01:33,162 --> 00:01:34,372
Now in order to do that,

33
00:01:34,372 --> 00:01:37,479
we might need network connectivity to actually go in and

34
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:39,413
connect to some authentication system.

35
00:01:39,413 --> 00:01:42,094
Now this authentication would then verify those certificates

36
00:01:42,094 --> 00:01:45,487
and then maybe pass them on in terms of the information that

37
00:01:45,487 --> 00:01:48,231
they're sending to a public cloud, a local device,

38
00:01:48,231 --> 00:01:50,145
or an on-premises server.

39
00:01:50,145 --> 00:01:53,250
Now each of these different things might also require us to have some

40
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:56,201
certificate management system so that we can verify other local

41
00:01:56,201 --> 00:01:58,608
devices or just the ones that we're using now.

42
00:01:58,608 --> 00:02:00,443
Now in addition to certificate management,

43
00:02:00,443 --> 00:02:04,479
we might need permissions so that we know which devices that

44
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,870
are sending information in are allowed to send it to the

45
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:08,646
public cloud or local devices as well.

46
00:02:08,646 --> 00:02:11,814
We don't want every device to have all the permissions or it might

47
00:02:11,814 --> 00:02:14,115
exploit those later on if it ever gets hacked.

48
00:02:14,115 --> 00:02:15,520
Now in addition to permissions,

49
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,498
we want to make sure we can store some of the data that's coming in,

50
00:02:18,498 --> 00:02:20,337
so we'd need some data stores.

51
00:02:20,337 --> 00:02:23,213
We might also want to integrate devices or the data that's coming

52
00:02:23,213 --> 00:02:26,380
in with other applications or third party APIs.

53
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:26,881
In addition to that,

54
00:02:26,881 --> 00:02:29,133
we might want to do backups of the data that's coming in or

55
00:02:29,133 --> 00:02:31,199
the devices and the states that they're in.

56
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:34,597
We might also want to monitor and log our devices to see if

57
00:02:34,597 --> 00:02:37,958
there's anything unusual happening and also just to graph the

58
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:39,923
variances in our device fleets.

59
00:02:39,923 --> 00:02:40,421
In addition,

60
00:02:40,421 --> 00:02:43,154
we might have workflows that we want to integrate into our

61
00:02:43,154 --> 00:02:45,107
systems so that if something happens on a device,

62
00:02:45,107 --> 00:02:47,621
we can then trigger other things to happen down the line.

63
00:02:47,621 --> 00:02:48,944
Now in addition to workflows,

64
00:02:48,944 --> 00:02:51,864
maybe we have lots and lots of devices and we want to be

65
00:02:51,864 --> 00:02:54,267
able to group them into logical categories.

66
00:02:54,267 --> 00:02:56,406
This is another feature that we might have to build

67
00:02:56,406 --> 00:02:58,789
ourselves if we were doing this all on our own.

68
00:02:58,789 --> 00:03:02,006
So this should give you a decent idea of what the kinds of

69
00:03:02,006 --> 00:03:05,811
things are that we would actually need in order to start

70
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:08,536
working with devices in IoT effectively.

71
00:03:08,536 --> 00:03:13,239
So now let's take a look at how AWS starts to solve some of these problems.

72
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:15,662
First let's take a look at device software.

73
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:19,831
Now AWS offers many different tools and one of them is Amazon FreeRTOS.

74
00:03:19,831 --> 00:03:22,104
This is an IoT device operating system.

75
00:03:22,104 --> 00:03:25,232
Now it's going to be installed on IoT devices themselves to

76
00:03:25,232 --> 00:03:27,855
allow you to interface more effectively.

77
00:03:27,855 --> 00:03:30,571
This is an open source piece of software that you can integrate with

78
00:03:30,571 --> 00:03:33,868
your devices to allow them to be used more effectively.

79
00:03:33,868 --> 00:03:37,057
In addition to this operating system that Amazon provides that's very

80
00:03:37,057 --> 00:03:39,804
lightweight and is meant to be installed on IoT devices,

81
00:03:39,804 --> 00:03:43,315
it also offers the AWS IoT device SDK.

82
00:03:43,315 --> 00:03:47,401
Now this comes in multiple languages and provides SDKs for programming with

83
00:03:47,401 --> 00:03:52,094
IoT devices that need to interact with the AWS cloud.

84
00:03:52,094 --> 00:03:56,793
Now in addition to the AWS device SDK, which can be used on those IoT devices,

85
00:03:56,793 --> 00:03:59,021
we also have AWS IoT Greengrass.

86
00:03:59,021 --> 00:04:04,277
Now this allows you to extend AWS services down into your own devices.

87
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:08,128
So rather than having all of your devices need to connect up into the cloud,

88
00:04:08,128 --> 00:04:13,404
you can extend the functionality of AWS services down into your own hardware

89
00:04:13,404 --> 00:04:18,588
in your own maybe manufacturing environment or other locations that need some

90
00:04:18,588 --> 00:04:22,951
sort of ability to use things like AWS services,

91
00:04:22,951 --> 00:04:24,924
but don't always get to connect to the internet.

92
00:04:24,924 --> 00:04:27,673
So this can really expand the amount of things that

93
00:04:27,673 --> 00:04:29,943
you can do with those devices.

94
00:04:29,943 --> 00:04:34,800
Now in addition to device software, there's also AWS Management Services.

95
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,809
Now some of these are not specific to IoT,

96
00:04:37,809 --> 00:04:40,695
but they're all useful for IoT itself.

97
00:04:40,695 --> 00:04:42,873
One of the first ones is the Thing Registry.

98
00:04:42,873 --> 00:04:46,252
And this going to allow you to register all the IoT things that

99
00:04:46,252 --> 00:04:49,376
you have so that you can keep track of them,

100
00:04:49,376 --> 00:04:50,017
use certificates for them,

101
00:04:50,017 --> 00:04:53,731
and do a bunch of other things specifically related to those things,

102
00:04:53,731 --> 00:04:56,222
like grouping them and adding metadata.

103
00:04:56,222 --> 00:04:57,642
In addition to the Thing Registry,

104
00:04:57,642 --> 00:05:00,862
there's also features for security and identity verification.

105
00:05:00,862 --> 00:05:03,116
Now these are going to allow you to assign certificates

106
00:05:03,116 --> 00:05:07,226
to different things in the registry, create certificates that you might need,

107
00:05:07,226 --> 00:05:10,386
and otherwise control permissions and things along

108
00:05:10,386 --> 00:05:12,413
those certificates and authentications.

109
00:05:12,413 --> 00:05:15,947
There's also the AWS IoT Device Defender.

110
00:05:15,947 --> 00:05:19,084
Now Device Defender is going to help you by auditing your fleets of IoT

111
00:05:19,084 --> 00:05:22,865
devices and making sure that you're configuring them with best practices

112
00:05:22,865 --> 00:05:25,399
and otherwise notifying you if you're not.

113
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:27,879
Now in addition to Device Defender, there's also the Message Broker,

114
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:31,887
which will allow you to send and receive messages from IoT devices effectively

115
00:05:31,887 --> 00:05:34,952
and then take actions off of those messages down the line.

116
00:05:34,952 --> 00:05:37,822
We'll also be talking about the IoT Thing Graph,

117
00:05:37,822 --> 00:05:41,133
which will allow you to help keep track of the various IoT

118
00:05:41,133 --> 00:05:44,396
things underneath your organization's umbrella.

119
00:05:44,396 --> 00:05:45,762
And finally, there's on other point,

120
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:48,711
which is one of the ones that is less related specifically to IoT,

121
00:05:48,711 --> 00:05:52,376
but more to AWS in general, which is Identity and Access Management.

122
00:05:52,376 --> 00:05:54,114
If you're unfamiliar with AWS,

123
00:05:54,114 --> 00:05:57,019
you can essentially think of this as the overlying system

124
00:05:57,019 --> 00:06:00,522
that is helping keep everything secure and properly

125
00:06:00,522 --> 00:06:02,995
authenticated when you're working with AWS.

126
00:06:02,995 --> 00:06:04,550
It manages everything from granting users

127
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:07,509
permissions to do things on AWS services,

128
00:06:07,509 --> 00:06:10,620
to also making sure that any applications that you're

129
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,943
running inside of the AWS cloud have permissions

130
00:06:12,943 --> 00:06:15,058
appropriately to act on other services.

131
00:06:15,058 --> 00:06:17,816
So in addition to these management services,

132
00:06:17,816 --> 00:06:22,260
the final kind of building block here is the analysis and action section.

133
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:25,934
And AWS has many different services to help you do this,

134
00:06:25,934 --> 00:06:29,314
ranging from AWS IoT Analytics to help you analyze the data

135
00:06:29,314 --> 00:06:31,626
that's coming into your IoT environment,

136
00:06:31,626 --> 00:06:33,517
and then develop meaningful insights from it,

137
00:06:33,517 --> 00:06:36,295
and also AWS IoT SiteWise,

138
00:06:36,295 --> 00:06:38,876
which is going to help people in manufacturing environments actually

139
00:06:38,876 --> 00:06:42,574
keep track of the equipment that's on their locations.

140
00:06:42,574 --> 00:06:44,501
There's also AWS IoT Events,

141
00:06:44,501 --> 00:06:48,089
which will help you act on different things that are coming into the IoT

142
00:06:48,089 --> 00:06:51,360
environment and the trigger other reactions from that.

143
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,066
And finally,

144
00:06:52,066 --> 00:06:56,807
there's other AWS integrations even outside of all of these specific services.

145
00:06:56,807 --> 00:06:59,918
You can integrate with a vast variety of different services that

146
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:03,459
AWS already has inside of their services suite.

147
00:07:03,459 --> 00:07:06,329
So now that you have an understanding of all of these different services,

148
00:07:06,329 --> 00:07:09,148
I hope that'll get you ready for future sections where we'll dive

149
00:07:09,148 --> 00:07:16,000
into many of these different services themselves and help you understand the specifics of what each of them do.
