1
00:00:01,069 --> 00:00:03,746
So now let's take a look at authentication and authorization and

2
00:00:03,746 --> 00:00:07,167
how these two different things can work together to help us

3
00:00:07,167 --> 00:00:09,250
secure our applications and devices.

4
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:14,256
Now let's briefly take a look at what authentication and authorization are.

5
00:00:14,256 --> 00:00:18,632
When we're talking about authentication, we mean being able to prove how we are.

6
00:00:18,632 --> 00:00:20,270
When we're talking about authorization,

7
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:23,088
we mean being able to prove what we have permissions to do.

8
00:00:23,088 --> 00:00:27,307
Now when I'm saying we, I don't necessarily always mean us as individuals,

9
00:00:27,307 --> 00:00:32,157
but also devices that might take advantage of these two different concepts.

10
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:35,795
So let's first start by looking at AWS IoT authentication.

11
00:00:35,795 --> 00:00:38,523
There's going to be multiple forms of authentication and then

12
00:00:38,523 --> 00:00:42,206
there's going to be purposes of that authentication.

13
00:00:42,206 --> 00:00:44,921
So the first form of authentication is X.509 certificates.

14
00:00:44,921 --> 00:00:48,534
There's also identity and access management users,

15
00:00:48,534 --> 00:00:51,074
groups, and roles, which I'll talk about in a moment,

16
00:00:51,074 --> 00:00:54,172
but are another concept inside of the AWS umbrella.

17
00:00:54,172 --> 00:00:57,735
After that, there's Amazon Cognito identities,

18
00:00:57,735 --> 00:01:00,667
which again, is another concept related to AWS.

19
00:01:00,667 --> 00:01:01,768
And federated identities,

20
00:01:01,768 --> 00:01:05,398
which will allow organizations that already have existing federation

21
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:09,992
and identity solutions to integrate those with IoT.

22
00:01:09,992 --> 00:01:10,545
And finally,

23
00:01:10,545 --> 00:01:12,107
there's also custom authentication strategies that you

24
00:01:12,107 --> 00:01:14,661
could use when you're working with IoT.

25
00:01:14,661 --> 00:01:17,963
So what are the purposes of each of these forms of authentication?

26
00:01:17,963 --> 00:01:22,182
Well X.509 certificates are going to be used on IoT devices so that those

27
00:01:22,182 --> 00:01:25,469
devices can prove they are the device that they say they are.

28
00:01:25,469 --> 00:01:27,520
Now the IAM users, groups,

29
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,632
and roles are going to allow you to use things like the CLI,

30
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:31,165
the SDKs,

31
00:01:31,165 --> 00:01:34,717
or you could integrate them in web and desktop applications that might

32
00:01:34,717 --> 00:01:38,231
be running with some components in the AWS cloud.

33
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:39,360
With Amazon Cognito identities,

34
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,017
those will be tied to mobile applications and mobile

35
00:01:42,017 --> 00:01:43,996
devices that use those mobile applications,

36
00:01:43,996 --> 00:01:46,806
and then federated identities will also be used

37
00:01:46,806 --> 00:01:49,525
sometimes for web and desktop applications.

38
00:01:49,525 --> 00:01:51,165
Now with custom authentication strategies,

39
00:01:51,165 --> 00:01:55,287
those could be used for web, desktop, or mobile applications as well.

40
00:01:55,287 --> 00:01:57,710
So in addition to authentication methods,

41
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:01,175
how can we deal with authorization in IoT?

42
00:02:01,175 --> 00:02:04,417
Well there's two kinds of authorization that we might interact with.

43
00:02:04,417 --> 00:02:09,290
The first is AWS IoT policies, and the second is AWS IAM policies,

44
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:12,358
or identity and access management policies.

45
00:02:12,358 --> 00:02:16,585
So what do these two different kinds of policies actually allow us to do?

46
00:02:16,585 --> 00:02:19,254
Well let's look at some example authorized actions that we

47
00:02:19,254 --> 00:02:22,249
might get from having one of these policies.

48
00:02:22,249 --> 00:02:25,128
One of the first actions we could potentially take with maybe an

49
00:02:25,128 --> 00:02:28,099
IoT policy would be to publish or subscribe.

50
00:02:28,099 --> 00:02:33,726
Now this would mean we could send or receive messages to MQTT message topics.

51
00:02:33,726 --> 00:02:37,312
We could also do things like management actions inside of the AWS console,

52
00:02:37,312 --> 00:02:41,346
where we might use an IAM policy to do things like manage certificates,

53
00:02:41,346 --> 00:02:45,032
IoT things themselves, rules related to those IoT things,

54
00:02:45,032 --> 00:02:47,423
or other actions of that nature.

55
00:02:47,423 --> 00:02:49,909
Now we could also do AWS integrations, for example,

56
00:02:49,909 --> 00:02:52,660
we might have an IAM policy set up to allow us to

57
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,098
interact with other AWS services.

58
00:02:54,098 --> 00:02:59,439
Now this could be things from storing data inside of Amazon S3 or

59
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:01,351
maybe integrating with the database like DynamoDb.

60
00:03:01,351 --> 00:03:03,909
Now each of these is just an example of the many different

61
00:03:03,909 --> 00:03:07,136
kinds of actions and the layering and complexity of these

62
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:08,911
policies that we could get into.

63
00:03:08,911 --> 00:03:09,469
But for right now,

64
00:03:09,469 --> 00:03:11,990
let's actually take a look at how authorization and

65
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:14,022
authentication are tied together,

66
00:03:14,022 --> 00:03:20,579
specifically what could we attach to an AWS IoT policy versus an AWS IAM policy?

67
00:03:20,579 --> 00:03:23,079
Well when we're working with AWS IoT policies,

68
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:26,643
we're more likely to attach those to Amazon Cognito

69
00:03:26,643 --> 00:03:28,888
identities or X.509 certificates,

70
00:03:28,888 --> 00:03:30,973
whereas when we're working with AWS IAM policies,

71
00:03:30,973 --> 00:03:33,498
we're going to associate those with users,

72
00:03:33,498 --> 00:03:35,397
with groups, and with roles.

73
00:03:35,397 --> 00:03:39,039
So both of these different kinds of policies will not only

74
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:42,508
give us different permissions to take actions on IoT related

75
00:03:42,508 --> 00:03:44,605
concepts or AWS related services,

76
00:03:44,605 --> 00:03:50,000
but they'll also frequently be attached to completely separate things, like you see here.
