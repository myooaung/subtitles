00:00:01.154 --> 00:00:03.904
I wouldn't be doing my job if I didn't take you through a few bits of

2
00:00:03.904 --> 00:00:08.086
common jargon that'll prepare you for whenever you're working with AWS IoT

3
00:00:08.086 --> 00:00:11.133
interacting with others who have some experience with it or even just

4
00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:13.978
trying to get through the AWS documentation.

5
00:00:13.978 --> 00:00:16.379
So let's really quickly take a look at a few terms,

6
00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.542
starting with the AWS IoT Core.

7
00:00:19.542 --> 00:00:21.557
So what is this AWS IoT Core?

8
00:00:21.557 --> 00:00:21.899
Well,

9
00:00:21.899 --> 00:00:25.971
it includes everything from the IoT Device Gateway to the authentication

10
00:00:25.971 --> 00:00:29.983
and authorization portions of the IoT systems in AWS,

11
00:00:29.983 --> 00:00:33.529
also the Thing Registry where we go and actually register things,

12
00:00:33.529 --> 00:00:37.284
as well as the Device Shadow Service, which I'll talk about shortly,

13
00:00:37.284 --> 00:00:39.141
and the Message Broker,

14
00:00:39.141 --> 00:00:43.553
which will allow us to manage the messages coming in and out of IoT devices,

15
00:00:43.553 --> 00:00:45.803
as well as the Rules Engine,

16
00:00:45.803 --> 00:00:48.510
which will allow us to do some things related to what happens

17
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.587
when devices take specific actions or some messages trigger

18
00:00:52.587 --> 00:00:55.361
to some Message Broker topic.

19
00:00:55.361 --> 00:00:57.232
So don't worry that we've only talked about some of

20
00:00:57.232 --> 00:00:58.914
these things on the top level here,

21
00:00:58.914 --> 00:01:00.953
I'll go into more detail on some of these bottom

22
00:01:00.953 --> 00:01:03.508
level services in the next sections.

23
00:01:03.508 --> 00:01:08.519
Now in addition to the AWS IoT Core, the words AWS IoT Device Management,

24
00:01:08.519 --> 00:01:11.709
or IoT Device Management, are thrown around a lot too.

25
00:01:11.709 --> 00:01:14.549
Now this essentially just means a few overlapping

26
00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.475
characteristics of IoT Core itself.

27
00:01:16.475 --> 00:01:18.940
And this includes things like the Thing Registry,

28
00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.064
the Fleet Indexing Service, the Jobs Service,

29
00:01:22.064 --> 00:01:23.165
device logging,

30
00:01:23.165 --> 00:01:27.600
so essentially the logs that are actually generated from our IoT things,

31
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.107
also thing attributes,

32
00:01:29.107 --> 00:01:32.979
both those searchable and non-searchable attributes that I mentioned earlier,

33
00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:34.670
and also thing groups and types,

34
00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.754
which are helpful to keep track of all those different

35
00:01:36.754 --> 00:01:38.878
things that we have inside of our account.

36
00:01:38.878 --> 00:01:41.428
So hopefully this will dispel some of the marketing jargon

37
00:01:41.428 --> 00:01:44.375
and you can dive into this knowing what exactly is being

38
00:01:44.375 --> 00:01:46.483
talked about with these two terms.

39
00:01:46.483 --> 00:01:47.616
But now that I've talked about some of this jargon,

40
00:01:47.616 --> 00:01:52.655
let's go ahead and recap what we've done inside of this entire module.

41
00:01:52.655 --> 00:01:55.419
Now we started by looking at device software.

42
00:01:55.419 --> 00:01:59.741
Now we looked at device software both for IoT things and also for edge data

43
00:01:59.741 --> 00:02:04.869
processing with Amazon FreeRTOS and the AWS Greengrass Core.

44
00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:07.411
Now that software enables us to do a lot of different things,

45
00:02:07.411 --> 00:02:13.719
but we also needed the AWS IoT device SDKs to run on top of it to interact

46
00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:17.847
with the AWS IoT Core and the services inside of it.

47
00:02:17.847 --> 00:02:19.259
Now outside of that device software,

48
00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:22.398
we looked at management services that allowed us to

49
00:02:22.398 --> 00:02:24.985
do things ranging from security, authentication,

50
00:02:24.985 --> 00:02:25.804
and authorization,

51
00:02:25.804 --> 00:02:29.831
to being able to manage and onboard new IoT things and

52
00:02:29.831 --> 00:02:31.954
devices that are coming into our system,

53
00:02:31.954 --> 00:02:35.049
and also to clarify some of the terminology and concepts

54
00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:39.489
surrounding many of these different components of IoT.

55
00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:41.943
So hopefully you feel pretty confident about where you're at

56
00:02:41.943 --> 00:02:43.588
with all of these different components,

57
00:02:43.588 --> 00:02:52.000
and in the next modules we'll take a look at even more of them, so you can feel even more confident going forward.
