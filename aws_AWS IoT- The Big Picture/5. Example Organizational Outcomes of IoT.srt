1
00:00:00,819 --> 00:00:05,241
So now let's take a look at two specific examples of improvements to an

2
00:00:05,241 --> 00:00:08,770
organization that were directly the result of leveraging IoT.

3
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:08,941
First,

4
00:00:08,941 --> 00:00:10,965
we'll take a look at the example of Centratech and then

5
00:00:10,965 --> 00:00:14,563
we'll take a look at the example of iRobot.

6
00:00:14,563 --> 00:00:18,559
Centratech works for the Australian government primarily and helps deal

7
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:23,351
with things like water shortages and other utility needs that local city

8
00:00:23,351 --> 00:00:27,916
councils and other parts of Australian government actually need in order to

9
00:00:27,916 --> 00:00:29,764
provide utilities to their residents.

10
00:00:29,764 --> 00:00:32,996
Now Centratech previously had been doing manual repairs on

11
00:00:32,996 --> 00:00:35,418
many different devices in the field.

12
00:00:35,418 --> 00:00:38,745
Now those manual repairs were time consuming and expensive

13
00:00:38,745 --> 00:00:41,198
because they had to send technicians all the way out to

14
00:00:41,198 --> 00:00:43,301
the devices to repair them.

15
00:00:43,301 --> 00:00:44,821
They were also doing server management,

16
00:00:44,821 --> 00:00:47,763
so they had to pay their developers to not only develop applications,

17
00:00:47,763 --> 00:00:51,273
but also to manage the underlying infrastructure that they

18
00:00:51,273 --> 00:00:53,321
were building those applications on top of.

19
00:00:53,321 --> 00:00:54,406
In addition to this,

20
00:00:54,406 --> 00:00:57,261
they were previously doing 6 hour trainings for each of

21
00:00:57,261 --> 00:01:00,026
their field technicians so that every time they had to go

22
00:01:00,026 --> 00:01:01,322
out and actually start the job,

23
00:01:01,322 --> 00:01:04,520
it took 6 hours to get the training they needed before they could go

24
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:08,398
out there and actually repair the physical devices.

25
00:01:08,398 --> 00:01:13,244
Now they eventually ended up using AWS IoT to allow them to

26
00:01:13,244 --> 00:01:16,763
actually have the devices in the field be repaired remotely and

27
00:01:16,763 --> 00:01:19,022
drastically cut down on the amount of time,

28
00:01:19,022 --> 00:01:22,799
and therefore the cost, it took to repair many of those devices.

29
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,180
Additionally, they transitioned over to the AWS IoT managed platform,

30
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,367
which means that because they were using AWS IoT,

31
00:01:29,367 --> 00:01:33,314
they didn't have to pay anybody anymore to manage that infrastructure.

32
00:01:33,314 --> 00:01:35,197
AWS took care of it for them.

33
00:01:35,197 --> 00:01:38,618
Also, after they simplified a lot of their platform and applications,

34
00:01:38,618 --> 00:01:43,351
they were able to cut the training time down to a single hour.

35
00:01:43,351 --> 00:01:46,536
So these were just a few examples of how Centratech actually improved the

36
00:01:46,536 --> 00:01:50,692
efficiency of their organization using IoT technologies.

37
00:01:50,692 --> 00:01:55,941
Now in addition to the Centratech outcomes, we also have the example of iRobot.

38
00:01:55,941 --> 00:02:00,914
Now iRobot is a manufacturer of wireless and cordless vacuums that

39
00:02:00,914 --> 00:02:04,099
robotically go around your home and clean it up.

40
00:02:04,099 --> 00:02:08,367
Now iRobot, back in July of 2015, sold 14,

41
00:02:08,367 --> 00:02:13,485
000 Roomba robotic vacuums just in a single day on Amazon Prime day.

42
00:02:13,485 --> 00:02:17,295
Now it eventually later launched internet- connected Roombas,

43
00:02:17,295 --> 00:02:22,265
which are another version of its traditional robot vacuum machine.

44
00:02:22,265 --> 00:02:25,771
And those internet-connected Roombas then needed to go out and

45
00:02:25,771 --> 00:02:29,108
actually use cloud services to leverage the additional resources

46
00:02:29,108 --> 00:02:31,176
that they developed inside of the cloud.

47
00:02:31,176 --> 00:02:35,892
Now this required some authentication and authorization keys to enable that,

48
00:02:35,892 --> 00:02:40,046
but then they were also able to ingest real-time data from robots

49
00:02:40,046 --> 00:02:42,985
that they had in people's homes to the cloud.

50
00:02:42,985 --> 00:02:45,576
Now this allowed them to continually improve on those

51
00:02:45,576 --> 00:02:47,624
robots and build more features into them,

52
00:02:47,624 --> 00:02:51,360
leveraging the cloud connect that they had and that connection to the internet.

53
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,936
Now this is an example of improving the product itself,

54
00:02:53,936 --> 00:02:58,190
so it kind of falls on the other end of the spectrum that we talked about when

55
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:01,942
it comes to organizational outcomes with revenue growth.

56
00:03:01,942 --> 00:03:05,088
And these two examples of iRobot and Centratech are just a few of

57
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:08,798
the examples that I've actually pulled from AWS's website to take

58
00:03:08,798 --> 00:03:16,000
a look at how different people are using and leveraging IoT to improve their organizations.
