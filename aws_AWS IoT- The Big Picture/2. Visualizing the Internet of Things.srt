1
00:00:01,034 --> 00:00:02,548
So what is the Internet of Things?

2
00:00:02,548 --> 00:00:06,632
Well let's get started with a quick definition of the Internet of Things.

3
00:00:06,632 --> 00:00:10,664
The network of traditionally non-networked devices like teapots,

4
00:00:10,664 --> 00:00:11,741
dishwashers, or vehicles,

5
00:00:11,741 --> 00:00:14,175
that contain the hardware and software required to connect

6
00:00:14,175 --> 00:00:16,744
with other devices and exchange data.

7
00:00:16,744 --> 00:00:19,810
Now this will start to get us a little bit of an understanding of what

8
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:23,596
we're talking about when people use the words IoT.

9
00:00:23,596 --> 00:00:25,725
But let's take a look at a visual to help us get a

10
00:00:25,725 --> 00:00:27,124
look at this a little bit better.

11
00:00:27,124 --> 00:00:30,265
We'll start with some of those IoT devices that we mentioned.

12
00:00:30,265 --> 00:00:32,880
Now these are traditionally non-network things,

13
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,577
so not traditional computers or servers or maybe even cell

14
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:38,209
phones as we think of them in the modern age,

15
00:00:38,209 --> 00:00:42,005
but maybe something like a door with an internet connected lock or a car

16
00:00:42,005 --> 00:00:44,815
with maybe a speedometer in the long run or other bits of information

17
00:00:44,815 --> 00:00:47,004
that would eventually be sent to a network.

18
00:00:47,004 --> 00:00:50,531
Or maybe some hardware in a factory that we need to construct

19
00:00:50,531 --> 00:00:53,356
different things inside of a manufacturing environment.

20
00:00:53,356 --> 00:00:57,489
Now each of these devices would probably send or receive bits of information,

21
00:00:57,489 --> 00:01:00,689
and because of this they'd need to be networked in some way.

22
00:01:00,689 --> 00:01:03,707
Now these devices might just be networked in a way that's

23
00:01:03,707 --> 00:01:06,042
with a local application or a local device,

24
00:01:06,042 --> 00:01:09,250
so for example, in the instance of the manufacturing equipment,

25
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:12,530
maybe it doesn't eventually connect to the entire internet,

26
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:15,768
but it does communicate within the manufacturing environment and

27
00:01:15,768 --> 00:01:19,686
communicate to other local devices or local applications.

28
00:01:19,686 --> 00:01:21,746
However, for many other IoT devices,

29
00:01:21,746 --> 00:01:25,212
they will eventually connect to some sort of application server through the

30
00:01:25,212 --> 00:01:28,472
internet and then maybe be processed in different ways.

31
00:01:28,472 --> 00:01:31,225
So for the example of the locking door for the IoT device,

32
00:01:31,225 --> 00:01:33,729
it might connect to some sort of mobile application that

33
00:01:33,729 --> 00:01:36,517
would allow you to lock or unlock your door.

34
00:01:36,517 --> 00:01:37,270
For the car,

35
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:39,503
maybe we'd send speedometer information to an application that

36
00:01:39,503 --> 00:01:42,387
allows us to process that for insurance companies.

37
00:01:42,387 --> 00:01:44,802
And this actually happens frequently where if you

38
00:01:44,802 --> 00:01:46,816
sign up and opt into these programs,

39
00:01:46,816 --> 00:01:49,929
you might be eligible for reduced rates if you're a safe driver

40
00:01:49,929 --> 00:01:52,888
and you're driving within the average speed limits of the area

41
00:01:52,888 --> 00:01:55,685
or the required rules for the road.

42
00:01:55,685 --> 00:01:58,205
Now let's take another look at some segments of IoT,

43
00:01:58,205 --> 00:02:00,774
just so we can get a better understanding not only of these

44
00:02:00,774 --> 00:02:03,115
individual devices and how they might work,

45
00:02:03,115 --> 00:02:07,183
but general segments that the entire IoT market might have.

46
00:02:07,183 --> 00:02:10,081
Now the first one that we already discussed a little bit is vehicles.

47
00:02:10,081 --> 00:02:13,117
You'll frequently see these not only in your own cars and the

48
00:02:13,117 --> 00:02:16,239
devices inside of those that send and receive information for

49
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:17,392
maintenance and other purposes,

50
00:02:17,392 --> 00:02:21,117
but also in things like 16 wheelers that have lots and lots of

51
00:02:21,117 --> 00:02:23,095
information that they send back and forth,

52
00:02:23,095 --> 00:02:26,996
both on the places that the goods that they're carrying go and the

53
00:02:26,996 --> 00:02:30,084
maintenance information on those large vehicles.

54
00:02:30,084 --> 00:02:34,117
In addition, there'll also be IoT used in agriculture or in security,

55
00:02:34,117 --> 00:02:38,316
to do things like monitor the progress of growing plants and also just

56
00:02:38,316 --> 00:02:41,115
to keep track of different locations and try and make sure that no

57
00:02:41,115 --> 00:02:43,999
intruders are coming into those locations.

58
00:02:43,999 --> 00:02:45,974
You'll also frequently see IoT within the medical industry,

59
00:02:45,974 --> 00:02:50,163
and it'll be used within hospitals to monitor the various

60
00:02:50,163 --> 00:02:52,211
devices that are in those hospitals.

61
00:02:52,211 --> 00:02:54,312
Now frequently this will impart a bit of a responsibility on

62
00:02:54,312 --> 00:02:56,913
us when we're using IoT to do it correctly.

63
00:02:56,913 --> 00:02:59,704
And we'll talk more about these risks later on.

64
00:02:59,704 --> 00:03:00,581
Now in addition to medicine,

65
00:03:00,581 --> 00:03:02,950
you'll also see these in buildings and cities and homes.

66
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:05,718
Now these sorts of integrations could be anything from

67
00:03:05,718 --> 00:03:08,830
traffic lights to just integrations on the door lock in our

68
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:10,551
home that we talked about earlier.

69
00:03:10,551 --> 00:03:10,721
However,

70
00:03:10,721 --> 00:03:14,044
they'll also frequently be used to try and save on things like electricity

71
00:03:14,044 --> 00:03:17,325
or power that might be used for heating and cooling when there's nobody in

72
00:03:17,325 --> 00:03:20,047
the building or the temperature inside or outside the building is

73
00:03:20,047 --> 00:03:22,127
fluctuating a little bit differently.

74
00:03:22,127 --> 00:03:24,115
Now to kind of lead into our next segment here,

75
00:03:24,115 --> 00:03:28,116
the utilities will also use this information and use IoT devices to help

76
00:03:28,116 --> 00:03:30,644
monitor the progress of their various utility networks.

77
00:03:30,644 --> 00:03:34,174
Now all of these are just a few of the segments that we

78
00:03:34,174 --> 00:03:37,108
might encounter when we're working with IoT.

79
00:03:37,108 --> 00:03:39,896
But I wanted to give you a basic understanding of all these IoT

80
00:03:39,896 --> 00:03:41,938
segments and the fact that there are many more,

81
00:03:41,938 --> 00:03:50,000
to let you see how pervasive IoT currently is and how likely it is that this will continue to be of importance later on.
