00:00:01.373 --> 00:00:03.331
So let's really quickly take a look at the Fleet

2
00:00:03.331 --> 00:00:06.218
Indexing Service and the Jobs Service.

3
00:00:06.218 --> 00:00:09.390
These two different services provide us with completely separate things,

4
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:11.396
but we're going to briefly take a look at each of them.

5
00:00:11.396 --> 00:00:14.157
The Fleet Indexing service is going to be a managed

6
00:00:14.157 --> 00:00:17.343
service that will allow us to search through the registry

7
00:00:17.343 --> 00:00:18.708
data inside of the Thing Registry,

8
00:00:18.708 --> 00:00:20.591
it's also going to allow us to look at shadow data,

9
00:00:20.591 --> 00:00:23.241
and we'll talk about shadows a little bit later on,

10
00:00:23.241 --> 00:00:26.025
as well as looking at device life-cycle events,

11
00:00:26.025 --> 00:00:28.453
like connections and disconnections.

12
00:00:28.453 --> 00:00:32.697
And it's going to allow us to create dynamic thing groups using the

13
00:00:32.697 --> 00:00:36.319
searches that we can make on all of this index data.

14
00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:39.156
Now in addition to being able to search through all of this data,

15
00:00:39.156 --> 00:00:41.761
it's going to allow us to control what we actually want

16
00:00:41.761 --> 00:00:44.492
to index so that we can search it.

17
00:00:44.492 --> 00:00:45.239
So in this way,

18
00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.524
we'll be able to say which specific attributes we want to

19
00:00:47.524 --> 00:00:51.341
be able to search and also what other data we do or don't

20
00:00:51.341 --> 00:00:52.850
want to pay attention to.

21
00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.225
Now this is completely separate from the Job service,

22
00:00:55.225 --> 00:00:59.409
which is going to allow us to coordinate device updates using that over

23
00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:01.700
the air device updating that I mentioned earlier.

24
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.338
It's also going to allow us to review the status of over the air

25
00:01:05.338 --> 00:01:08.354
updates so we can keep track of different devices and whether or

26
00:01:08.354 --> 00:01:10.763
not those have been successful.

27
00:01:10.763 --> 00:01:13.754
It's also going to give us built in support to rollback to earlier

28
00:01:13.754 --> 00:01:17.830
versions of software and abort update jobs if they fail.

29
00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.525
And we've already discussed the over the air update process previously,

30
00:01:20.525 --> 00:01:24.489
so I won't really dive into the Job service very much now.

31
00:01:24.489 --> 00:01:24.913
And similarly,

32
00:01:24.913 --> 00:01:27.898
I've already discussed the capabilities of the Fleet Indexing service before,

33
00:01:27.898 --> 00:01:35.000
but I just wanted to point out both of these two different terms so that you're aware of them if you see them in the future.
