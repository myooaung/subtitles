00:00:01,662 --> 00:00:04,923
No discussion of AWS IoT device software would be complete

2
00:00:04,923 --> 00:00:09,367
without talking about the AWS IoT Device SDKs.

3
00:00:09,367 --> 00:00:11,284
So let's take a quick look at what these are.

4
00:00:11,284 --> 00:00:16,060
The AWS IoT Device SDKs allow you to easily connect to

5
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:19,448
AWS IoT and other AWS service s.

6
00:00:19,448 --> 00:00:23,235
They're going to use MQTT or MQTT over the WebSocket protocol,

7
00:00:23,235 --> 00:00:25,636
in order to make those connections,

8
00:00:25,636 --> 00:00:29,162
and they're also going to allow you to do things like publish and subscribe

9
00:00:29,162 --> 00:00:33,859
to IoT topics and interact with IoT rules and shadows.

10
00:00:33,859 --> 00:00:36,899
Now this is a subset of the functionality that they offer,

11
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:40,144
but essentially you can think of the device SDK as the

12
00:00:40,144 --> 00:00:44,002
massive library of tools that will let you leverage all of

13
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:46,618
the functionality of AWS IoT.

14
00:00:46,618 --> 00:00:50,936
Now the AWS IoT Device SDK comes in a variety of different types.

15
00:00:50,936 --> 00:00:56,021
It'll provide language support for things like development in iOS and Android,

16
00:00:56,021 --> 00:00:59,002
it'll also allow you to use Python or embedded C,

17
00:00:59,002 --> 00:01:01,898
C++, Java, and JavaScript.

18
00:01:01,898 --> 00:01:05,973
So essentially a lot of different support for many different platforms and

19
00:01:05,973 --> 00:01:08,851
languages to do whatever you'd like to do with your IoT devices.

20
00:01:08,851 --> 00:01:12,245
Now this will save you the work of having to manually code all

21
00:01:12,245 --> 00:01:15,126
of the different API calls to AWS services,

22
00:01:15,126 --> 00:01:18,268
and allow you to take advantage of security benefits and new features down

23
00:01:18,268 --> 00:01:22,238
the road as AWS continues to add more functionality.

24
00:01:22,238 --> 00:01:28,000
So be sure to take a look at this whenever you're starting a project with AWS IoT.
