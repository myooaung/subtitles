1
00:00:01,678 --> 00:00:05,107
Running a unit test with Spring changed as well.

2
00:00:05,107 --> 00:00:09,627
We used to use a runner and load our configuration from there.

3
00:00:09,627 --> 00:00:13,120
Now we can use an ExtendWith annotation,

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:19,495
as well as the SpringBootTest helper annotation to configure and run our test.

5
00:00:19,495 --> 00:00:21,497
To see a more real-world example of this,

6
00:00:21,497 --> 00:00:26,669
let's look at a client that will run a test to get a value from the

7
00:00:26,669 --> 00:00:29,605
reactive service we did in the previous demos.

8
00:00:29,605 --> 00:00:32,136
If you'll remember from our previous module,

9
00:00:32,136 --> 00:00:37,099
we had a call to a Mono web service that would return one

10
00:00:37,099 --> 00:00:40,195
Person object by just passing in an id,

11
00:00:40,195 --> 00:00:43,554
and you can see that we've built that request here on line 22.

12
00:00:43,554 --> 00:00:46,125
We're asking to go against our localhost.

13
00:00:46,125 --> 00:00:49,404
On 24, we're going to call the person API,

14
00:00:49,404 --> 00:00:54,426
and we're going to pass in a variable of 1 into that first placeholder.

15
00:00:54,426 --> 00:00:56,410
We're going to tell it that we're going to accept

16
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:58,833
JSON back as a response on line 25.

17
00:00:58,833 --> 00:01:04,969
And then we map that response on line 27, and 28 we grab the actually name back.

18
00:01:04,969 --> 00:01:09,169
Now a lot of this has more to do with how we handle a

19
00:01:09,169 --> 00:01:13,021
Mono object than our actual test, but you can see on line 30,

20
00:01:13,021 --> 00:01:14,908
we're going to do an assertion,

21
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:20,536
and I'm going to compare the string that comes back from that Mono object

22
00:01:20,536 --> 00:01:25,197
to the name of Bryan and see that that runs correctly.

23
00:01:25,197 --> 00:01:28,646
And I've gone ahead and set this test up.

24
00:01:28,646 --> 00:01:31,017
Our Mono server is, in fact, running.

25
00:01:31,017 --> 00:01:40,549
And I want to just right-click on this object and Run As, a JUnit Test.

26
00:01:40,549 --> 00:01:42,867
And it will run successfully and complete,

27
00:01:42,867 --> 00:01:47,723
and this is how we can do a real-world test against the Mono web

28
00:01:47,723 --> 00:01:51,831
object that we created earlier and assert that that test does bring

29
00:01:51,831 --> 00:01:54,527
back the response that we would like it to.

30
00:01:54,527 --> 00:01:57,893
There's a handful of ways we can do this with a Mono object,

31
00:01:57,893 --> 00:02:02,216
but this gives you the idea of how to run that SpringBootTest,

32
00:02:02,216 --> 00:02:10,000
use that @ExtendWith(SpringExtension. class) and do a roundtrip against our server.
