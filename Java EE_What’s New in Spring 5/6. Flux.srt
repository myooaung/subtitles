We saw how to deal with a single record responded to a stream,

2
00:00:05,347 --> 00:00:09,244
but a more effective use is more likely dealing with responses with

3
00:00:09,244 --> 00:00:12,868
multiple records being streamed back to the UI.

4
00:00:12,868 --> 00:00:22,000
We're going to look at integrating a fairly simple usage of the Flux object, but one that uses streams nonetheless.
