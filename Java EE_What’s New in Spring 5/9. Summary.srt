1
00:00:02,104 --> 00:00:06,405
In this module, we spoke about the manifesto of reactive apps.

2
00:00:06,405 --> 00:00:10,997
The manifesto really sets the stage about how we use WebFlux.

3
00:00:10,997 --> 00:00:14,359
Including WebFlux is quite easy as we demonstrated by

4
00:00:14,359 --> 00:00:16,626
including the dependency in the POM.

5
00:00:16,626 --> 00:00:20,216
We then demonstrated how to stream a single response

6
00:00:20,216 --> 00:00:24,060
using Mono and a collection using Flux.

7
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:24,380
Lastly,

8
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:27,257
we covered some of the difficulties you might encounter

9
00:00:27,257 --> 00:00:29,550
using streams in a reactive application,

10
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:32,787
much of which is just early adoption problems,

11
00:00:32,787 --> 00:00:35,834
even though we showed basic client functions.

12
00:00:35,834 --> 00:00:44,000
In this next module, we'll show how to properly test when we cover testing upgrades in Spring 5.
