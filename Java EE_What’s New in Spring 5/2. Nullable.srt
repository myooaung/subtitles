00:00:01,826 --> 00:00:05,430
A major overhaul to the entire API is declaring methods

2
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:07,595
that are nullable and non-nullable.

3
00:00:07,595 --> 00:00:12,023
When working with tools in other frameworks such as Kotlin,

4
00:00:12,023 --> 00:00:16,655
having parameters and return types to find in the API as such

5
00:00:16,655 --> 00:00:19,369
just helps with how these tools interoperate.

6
00:00:19,369 --> 00:00:21,549
It may not always help with your direct code,

7
00:00:21,549 --> 00:00:25,519
but with the tools that you will use, it will definitely make a difference.

8
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,984
This will also help us to catch null pointers at

9
00:00:28,984 --> 00:00:37,000
compile time rather than at runtime. We will demonstrate this more in the next module when we look at Kotlin.
