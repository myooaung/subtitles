1
00:00:01,505 --> 00:00:06,417
For this course, I'm going to be running all of the examples on Java 9.

2
00:00:06,417 --> 00:00:10,856
I will run all of my exercises through the Spring STS IDE

3
00:00:10,856 --> 00:00:13,065
or just the command line interface.

4
00:00:13,065 --> 00:00:18,963
For all the Java code, I'm going to use Maven for my builds and build management.

5
00:00:18,963 --> 00:00:22,104
And for the Kotlin examples, I'll use Gradle.

6
00:00:22,104 --> 00:00:27,975
Although we will cover it in the Kotlin section, I'm going to use 1.

7
00:00:27,975 --> 00:00:28,382
1.

8
00:00:28,382 --> 00:00:28,790
3.

9
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:34,328
And then finally we're going to cover JUnit 5 and compare it to JUnit 4.

10
00:00:34,328 --> 00:00:45,000
Those are all the prerequisites of what I have for this course. Let's look at what support was discontinued in Spring 5.
