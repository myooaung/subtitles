00:00:01.818 --> 00:00:05.268
This snippet of code shows a get mapping from a

2
00:00:05.268 --> 00:00:07.808
controller in a Spring MVC web application.

3
00:00:07.808 --> 00:00:09.742
Notice that to use streams,

4
00:00:09.742 --> 00:00:16.285
all we need to do is change the response body to a mono of type person and

5
00:00:16.285 --> 00:00:19.845
then build the mono object using the just statement.

6
00:00:19.845 --> 00:00:25.008
A Mono object is used when we want to return one single object,

7
00:00:25.008 --> 00:00:28.144
but still want to do it using streams.

8
00:00:28.144 --> 00:00:31.897
We would still want to use a stream to do this if we weren't sure how

9
00:00:31.897 --> 00:00:35.780
responsive the call would be and also if we just wanted it to be

10
00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.576
non-blocking and allow the UI thread to do other things while not

11
00:00:39.576 --> 00:00:42.067
having to wait for this call to return.

12
00:00:42.067 --> 00:00:51.000
Let's build a Spring MVC controller now and add this Mono return of a Person object.
