00:00:01.753 --> 00:00:06.046
Previously the entire framework was contained in a single jar.

2
00:00:06.046 --> 00:00:11.049
You needed to import the entire JUnit library just to run a single test.

3
00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:12.014
With JUnit 5,

4
00:00:12.014 --> 00:00:15.942
the framework has become more granular to allow you to import specific

5
00:00:15.942 --> 00:00:19.864
pieces for what you would like to accomplish with your tests.

6
00:00:19.864 --> 00:00:22.144
JUnit 5 is also more performant.

7
00:00:22.144 --> 00:00:26.362
In previous versions, you could only run a single test runner.

8
00:00:26.362 --> 00:00:29.076
Now you can run multiple test runners.

9
00:00:29.076 --> 00:00:31.879
This will allow you to inherently have multithreaded

10
00:00:31.879 --> 00:00:34.457
tests that will perform much faster.

11
00:00:34.457 --> 00:00:39.039
JUnit 4 was also limited to Java 7 features.

12
00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:42.268
These limitations were almost four years old.

13
00:00:42.268 --> 00:00:46.944
JUnit 5 was upgraded to take advantage of Java 8 and later features,

14
00:00:46.944 --> 00:00:51.259
thus eliminating a lot of the backwards compatibility baggage.

15
00:00:51.259 --> 00:00:53.461
To be able to take advantage of these features,

16
00:00:53.461 --> 00:00:57.011
JUnit was almost a complete rewrite of the entire API.

17
00:00:57.011 --> 00:00:59.583
To still use the older features,

18
00:00:59.583 --> 00:01:04.915
you can use the JUnit Vintage jar though for backwards compatibility.

19
00:01:04.915 --> 00:01:07.348
Let's look at what some of the different naming

20
00:01:07.348 --> 00:01:10.837
conventions are from JUnit 4 to 5.

21
00:01:10.837 --> 00:01:13.324
Some of the annotations were changed to make them more

22
00:01:13.324 --> 00:01:15.517
clear about what their functions are.

23
00:01:15.517 --> 00:01:21.459
Before was changed to BeforeEach since it is ran before each individual test.

24
00:01:21.459 --> 00:01:25.426
The same thing applies to After and AfterEach.

25
00:01:25.426 --> 00:01:28.099
Those annotations are at the test level.

26
00:01:28.099 --> 00:01:32.751
At the suite level, BeforeClass was changed to BeforeAll,

27
00:01:32.751 --> 00:01:36.501
and AfterClass was changed to AfterAll.

28
00:01:36.501 --> 00:01:40.157
And then finally, Ignore was changed to Disabled.

29
00:01:40.157 --> 00:01:50.000
Disabled works at the suite level and at the individual test level. Let's look at how exceptions have changed.
