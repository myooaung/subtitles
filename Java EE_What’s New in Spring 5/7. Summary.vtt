00:00:01.953 --> 00:00:03.172
In this module,

2
00:00:03.172 --> 00:00:07.595
we went and compared JUnit 4 versus JUnit 5 because there's

3
00:00:07.595 --> 00:00:10.457
quite a few significant changes in that API,

4
00:00:10.457 --> 00:00:15.742
and it affects ultimately how we test the code inside of our Spring application.

5
00:00:15.742 --> 00:00:17.890
We covered exceptions, assertions,

6
00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:23.628
and how we can do lambda expressions inside of those assertions.

7
00:00:23.628 --> 00:00:29.476
We looked at the Assumptions API and then finally did an example

8
00:00:29.476 --> 00:00:34.576
with ExtendWith that shows us how to run that against a

9
00:00:34.576 --> 00:00:38.162
SpringBootTest against our Mono server that we had.

10
00:00:38.162 --> 00:00:44.029
And this actually concludes the course on What's New in Spring 5.

11
00:00:44.029 --> 00:00:47.368
I hope you've found this informational and you're able to

12
00:00:47.368 --> 00:00:55.000
go ahead and begin using the new features inside of Spring 5 in your applications today.
