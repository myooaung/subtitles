Hello and welcome to the Skala and sparked for Big Data A machine learning course.

2
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.750
My name is Jose Portsea and I've taught tens of thousands of students Anyuta me about programming and

3
00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:10.640
data science.

4
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.860
I'm so excited to teach you about the newest technologies for analyzing big data.

5
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.270
This course covers both the scholar programming language and utilizing Scala to work with Sparke to

6
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.790
analyze big data.

7
00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.860
So why learn Skala and Sparke Scala has been reported to be one of the most valuable tech skills in

8
00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:34.200
the market today with payscale dot com reporting that knowledge of Skala alone can result in an average

9
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.500
salary increase of 22 percent.

10
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.440
In addition to scholar Sparke is quickly becoming one of the most powerful big data technologies it

11
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:49.520
can run programs up to 100 times faster than Hadoop map reduce memory since SPARC is written in Scala.

12
00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:55.600
It can perform these big data tasks faster than any other API language for Sparc in this course.

13
00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:01.090
You'll learn the latest SPARC 2.0 methods and get the newest updates to Spark's machine learning library

14
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.440
Emelin all using SPARC sequel and SPARC data frames.

15
00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.440
The job market the man for this skill set has exploded.

16
00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.450
His first job postings growing by over 500 percent in recent years.

17
00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.260
Let's go ahead and take a peek at what is inside the course.

18
00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.710
We'll start off with a full set up and installation guide for your platform whether it's on Windows

19
00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.120
Mac OS or Linux.

20
00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.430
We've got you covered.

21
00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:30.280
Then we have a full guide Skala programming in a way that clears confusion and makes it easy to learn.

22
00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:36.640
Then we'll dive in to using Socolow of SPARC 2.0 learning how to use the latest data from syntax.

23
00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.320
Once we understand SPARC we can learn how to use Spark's machine learning library using the data from

24
00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:48.960
API all of these concepts are presented in lectures of full HD video and reference code for each topic.

25
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.260
So you can learn in the way that's best for you.

26
00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:56.400
We have coding exercises for you to fill out all along the way to test your understanding and practice

27
00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.860
your new skills.

28
00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:03.030
Not only do you get amazing content you'll also get access to our online question and answer forums

29
00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.160
were full of students and I are happy to help you out with any questions you may have.

30
00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.110
Upon completion of this course you'll also receive a certificate that you can post here linked in profile

31
00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.690
to show potential employers.
