00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:10,850
Welcome to the machine learning section of the course in this introduction section we're going to be

2
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:14,920
discussing a general overview of what machine learning is in this lecture.

3
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:19,640
Then in the next lecture we'll discuss machine learning and its specifics of spark and then we will

4
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:26,150
show you how to install Intel Ejay ID which is a full ID which may be helpful to you when conducting

5
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:30,370
Sparke with machine learning in this course.

6
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:35,650
We're going to be focusing on overall machine learning ideas and concepts not on specific algorithms

7
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:37,520
for each machine learning concept.

8
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,340
We will show you an example algorithm that you can easily switch out for the other algorithms available

9
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:44,200
in Spark's machine learning library.

10
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,070
Otherwise known as e-mail it.

11
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:52,510
The reason for this is because SPARC setup is actually tedious for M-L tasks due to the way that it's

12
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:53,530
distributed.

13
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:58,680
So you won't learn much by continually repeating the same mundane tasks for a different learning algorithm.

14
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:04,060
Instead SPARC makes it very easy for you to switch the algorithms with its pipeline object which we'll

15
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:06,430
be discussing in the next lecture.

16
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:10,050
Keep that in mind as you continue out through this machine learning section of the course.

17
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:16,100
For each specific machine learning algorithm that we do discuss we will have a brief theory discussion

18
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:19,350
for more information and background the machine learning algorithms.

19
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:25,750
I highly recommend the textbook introduction to statistical learning this book which is commonly referred

20
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:29,680
to as I SLR is a fundamental textbook for machine learning.

21
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,350
It's also available for free.

22
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,180
You can check out the resource link for more info.

23
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:37,500
Now let's get an overview of machine learning in general.

24
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:43,060
Let's discuss what is a machine learning machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates

25
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:48,790
analytical model building using algorithms that iterative Lee learn from data.

26
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:54,760
Machine learning allows computers to find hidden insights without being explicitly programs where to

27
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:59,570
look you may be wondering what is machine learning used for.

28
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:06,680
It's used in a lot of fields such as fraud detection real time ads on Web pages calculating new pricing

29
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:13,340
models financial modeling email spam filtering text sentiment analysis customer segmentation recommendation

30
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:15,540
engines and so much more.

31
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:21,650
And we're going to be exploring a lot of these cases with the machine learning portfolio projects presented

32
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:22,900
throughout this course.

33
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:27,310
Let's talk about the machine learning process in general.

34
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:33,310
First you need to acquire data so your data is going to have a lot of features based off whatever you're

35
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:34,460
trying to study.

36
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:39,640
Then you'll probably have to clean your data to get it into a nice format and you can use your panderers

37
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:45,230
skills in order to do that then you're going to split your data into test data and training data.

38
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:51,280
You will train your machine learning model on your training data and then you will test your model on

39
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,390
the test data which the model hasn't seen before.

40
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:59,890
And then you can iterate through this process try to tune your model to best fit both the training data

41
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02,350
and then test well on the test data.

42
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:06,590
Then once it's ready you can deploy your model.

43
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,970
Let's talk about what is machine learning and a little more detail.

44
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:15,690
There are three main types of machine learning algorithms supervised learning algorithms unsupervised

45
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:18,510
learning algorithms and reinforcement learning.

46
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:22,460
Let's briefly describe each type before diving in a little more detail.

47
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:29,560
Supervised learning is when you have labelled data and are trying to predict a label based off of known

48
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:35,590
features unsupervised learning is when you have unlabeled data and are trying to group maybe together

49
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:41,320
similar data points based off of other features or doing some other unsupervised Machine Learning tests

50
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,220
which we'll get into later on.

51
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:48,640
And then finally the reinforcement learning algorithm tries to learn to perform an action based off

52
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,330
of previous experience.

53
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:54,790
Let's discuss supervised learning in a little more detail.

54
00:03:54,830 --> 00:04:00,950
Again supervised learning algorithms are trained using labeled examples such as an input or the desired

55
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:02,630
output is known.

56
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:08,330
For example maybe have a piece of equipment that has data points labeled either for failed or are for

57
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:15,540
runs the learning algorithm receives a set of inputs along with the corresponding correct outputs and

58
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:21,460
then the algorithm learns by comparing its actual output with correct outputs to find errors.

59
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,830
It then modifies the model accordingly.

60
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:30,680
Through methods like classification regression prediction and gradient boosting supervised learning

61
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:37,670
uses patterns the values of the label on additional unlabeled data meaning train your model unlabeled

62
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:43,280
data and then later on you will feed your model unlabeled data and see if it can correctly predict the

63
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,370
label value.

64
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:51,540
Supervised learning is commonly used in applications where historical data predicts likely future events.

65
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:56,890
For example it can anticipate when credit card transactions are likely to be fraudulent or which insurance

66
00:04:56,890 --> 00:05:02,230
customer is likely to file a claim or can even attempt to predict the price of a house based off of

67
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:08,200
different features for houses for which we have historical price data unsupervised learning is used

68
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,820
against data that has no historical labels.

69
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:14,800
The system is not told the right answer.

70
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:20,950
The algorithm must figure out what is being shown and the goal here is to explore the data and find

71
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:27,580
some sort of structure within that data or can also find the main attributes that separate customer

72
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:29,350
segments from each other.

73
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:35,710
Popular techniques include self organizing maps nearest neighbor mapping Kamins clustering and singular

74
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:43,520
value decomposition these algorithms are also used to segment text topics recommend items and identify

75
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,110
data outliers.

76
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:49,770
This will make a lot more sense when we actually perform unsupervised learning with Python.

77
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:56,670
For now we'll just leave it at that and know that it has unlabeled data reinforcement learning is often

78
00:05:56,670 --> 00:06:02,520
used for robotics gaming and navigation with reinforcement learning the algorithm discovers through

79
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:10,460
trial and error which actions yield the greatest rewards this type of learning has three primary components.

80
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:15,740
The agent which is the learner or the decision maker the environment everything the agent interacts

81
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:22,110
with and then the actions what the agent can actually do or perform the objective is for the agent to

82
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:28,680
choose actions that maximize the expected reward over a given amount of time the agents will reach the

83
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,860
goal much faster by following a good policy.

84
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:37,030
So the goal in reinforcement learning is to learn the best policy.

85
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:38,830
All right so that's it for this lecture.

86
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:42,940
Coming up next is a discussion of machine learning specifics when using Sparke.

87
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,370
After that we'll show you how to install the Intel Ejay idea or idea interface.

88
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:50,410
Thanks everyone and I will see at the next lecture.
