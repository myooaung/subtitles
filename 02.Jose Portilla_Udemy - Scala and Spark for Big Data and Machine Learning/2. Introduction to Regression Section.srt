Hello everyone and welcome to the regression with SPARK section of the course.

2
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:14,620
Let's go ahead and finally begin to learn how to use Spark's incredible machine learning capabilities.

3
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:19,380
We'll start off by walking you through the documentation for the machine learning section specifically

4
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:24,870
the regression section of the documentation Spark's machine learning documentation is actually much

5
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:29,100
better than the rest of its documentation has really nice examples there.

6
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:33,690
So we'll go ahead and start off by walking you through some of the simple examples so you can get used

7
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:39,360
to referencing the documentation on your own in order to fill in any blanks you may have in the future.

8
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:42,180
Then we'll go ahead and code out our own example.

9
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:46,670
Walking you through step by step in the example that's different than the documentation.

10
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,910
And then finally you'll go ahead and have a project exercise to fill out on your own.

11
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:56,100
Will you be given a data set a set of instructions and you'll have to follow along and solve the problem

12
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,040
yourself.

13
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:01,530
All of the relevant files for this section are under the machine learning sections folder under the

14
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:02,740
regression folder.

15
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:04,140
All right I'm excited.

16
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:05,660
So let's go ahead and get started.

17
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:06,690
I'll see you at the next lecture.
