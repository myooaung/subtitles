00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:10.400
Hello everyone and welcome to the Scala and Sparke Ubuntu installation lecture and this lecture will

2
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:15.410
be walking you through how to install Skala and its dependencies such as Java and also how to install

3
00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:18.770
SPARC as well as the text editor.

4
00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:19.730
Let's get started.

5
00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.430
All right here I am at my Ubuntu desktop.

6
00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:25.520
First thing I need to do is open up your terminal.

7
00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:30.140
If you don't know how to do that you can just always search your computer and then search for terminal

8
00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:31.780
and it should bring it up.

9
00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.350
In this case I already have it open so I'll just go ahead and close that here at the terminal.

10
00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:42.770
We need to install Java first so you can go ahead and check to make sure Java is already installed but

11
00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.890
just typing Java version enter.

12
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:52.360
And if you get something like this it means you need to install Java and JDK in order to make sure that

13
00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.280
Skala installs correctly.

14
00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:00.160
First thing you want to do is say sudo gets and then update.

15
00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:05.170
Keep in mind when we're using sudo you're going to need to enter your password so you don't have a password

16
00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.390
for your Ubuntu program you're going to need to get that then just put in your password.

17
00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:16.600
Since this is a pseudo command it will work and it will make sure that sudo get is fully updated so

18
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.610
that will update our package index which will make sure that we actually grab the latest versions of

19
00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:23.170
everything we need.

20
00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.680
And another quick note I want to make is.

21
00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:31.630
You can check out a written instruction file or a link to a written instruction file in the resource

22
00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.030
section for this lecture.

23
00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.420
So in case you just want to read instead of actually watching this video you can just read up through

24
00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:38.440
the commands.

25
00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.510
Once you've gone ahead and said sudo apt get update the next thing you want to do is actually install

26
00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:56.500
the default JDK so say sudo apt gets install default JDK enter.

27
00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.630
Ill ask you if you want to continue.

28
00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.310
Say yes or put in wife.

29
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.680
Yes and it will install JDK.

30
00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.830
I'm going to jump ahead in time to this finished installation.

31
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:16.300
All right so Java has finished downloading installing Now I need to download and install Skala.

32
00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.520
So in your terminal you can type this.

33
00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:29.470
You will say sudo at get install Skala enter.

34
00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:36.170
You'll get a prompt that says Do you want to continue to reply for yes and that it will download install

35
00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:37.520
Skala for us.

36
00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.220
Let's jump in time to this finished installation.

37
00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:47.690
All right so we finished installing Skala to make sure that everything installed correctly.

38
00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:55.110
Go ahead and type Skala into your terminal and you should see a Skala ripple or read evaluate print's

39
00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.990
loop and then if you want to really make sure that everything's working and say prints Ellen double

40
00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:06.440
quotes Hello enter and you should see hello back.

41
00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.270
Right now we have scal installed but we need to go onto the next step and install Sparke.

42
00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.560
If you have everything running like this so far you are good.

43
00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:21.760
So do Colan Q to quit this Skoll interpreter and you can type clear for your terminal.

44
00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.500
So so far we've installed Java and we have installed Skala.

45
00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.570
Now it's time to install SPARC in order to install SPARC.

46
00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:35.060
We need to have a get installed so to make sure we have it installed.

47
00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:47.600
Just say sudo AAPT or apt get install G-I t get to enter say yes to continue and let that install.

48
00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:50.670
I'm going to jump again in time to this finished installation.

49
00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:57.090
In order to install SPARC we need to download the entire package.

50
00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.170
So open up a browser in order to do this.

51
00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.310
In this case I'm just using Firefox web browser and go to spark that Apache.

52
00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:17.190
The org may pull this up spark Apache org enter should see this page up and up and then once that's

53
00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:24.840
loaded click on download and make sure that you're using the latest version of Sparke that's greater

54
00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:25.990
than 2.0.

55
00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:32.070
If you want you can use 2.00 point 1 to point 0.2 etc. but it has to be greater than 2.0 to make sure

56
00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.380
everything we do in this course works.

57
00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:40.560
You want a pre-built for Hadoop 2.7 and later and you can do a direct download or you can select an

58
00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:45.360
Apache mirror direct download a slow but direct download should be fine for us.

59
00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:54.900
Go ahead and click here to download this dot TGT and then hit OK and let that download.

60
00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:02.620
I am going to jump ahead in time where this is finished downloading all right my download has completed.

61
00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:07.890
I have the spark 2.0 point one and its pre-built for Hadoop 2.7.

62
00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:10.330
Note that it's a TGF file.

63
00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.840
So we need to extract that.

64
00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.820
I have it under my downloads folder.

65
00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:18.350
I will move it to home just so it's easier to find later on.

66
00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:25.650
So under home now I can see a habit the TGV folder in case it's not under the ballots for you.

67
00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:28.520
You may also want to check your Tampere temporary folder.

68
00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:31.010
That should be available to you in your browser.

69
00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:34.330
If you just go over here you have a choice.

70
00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:37.170
Click here to display progress of ongoing downloads.

71
00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.080
That should also help you find it.

72
00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:44.880
Chrome also has a very similar thing where on the bottom over here it will show you where files downloaded

73
00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:46.380
are actually saved.

74
00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:50.350
Now click to terminal and go home.

75
00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:55.840
You can do this by just saying see the to change directory to your home directory and now you should

76
00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.040
see that spark that TVC file is there.

77
00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:05.520
Let's say tar XXVII F and then begin typing Sparke.

78
00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:09.870
You can use tab to autocomplete this and this should extract everything that we need.

79
00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.300
So let that extract.

80
00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:20.360
I will jump forward in time all right now that it has finished extracting that spark folder.

81
00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:25.480
I should be able to just say LS list and see that extract that Sparke folder.

82
00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:32.440
So you will change directory to spark and you can use tab to autocomplete this list the folders here

83
00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:40.480
and you should see Ben as a folder say CD to bin then go ahead and list these again.

84
00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:45.120
You should see things such as SPARC submit spark sequel spark shell spark Harke cetera.

85
00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:47.530
We're going to show you how to work with those later on.

86
00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:53.110
Right now we're going to keep things simple and just open up the spark shell which is basically like

87
00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:58.950
a revaluate print loop sort of terminal deal with SPARC instead of just Skala.

88
00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:07.300
So to do this say Dot forward slash spark bash shell enter.

89
00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:11.970
And this should eventually bring up the spark shell and as you're running this you may see some warnings

90
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.050
but don't worry.

91
00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:18.150
We'll show you later on how to set logging levels so you don't see a bunch of warnings as you're starting

92
00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:21.840
up a spark shell right now will keep things simple.

93
00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:27.840
You should see that it's starting a spark session spark context and it also gives you a little weblink

94
00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:35.850
here you can go ahead and with the scroll up here grab that HTP or L and it has a web interface for

95
00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:37.790
you to check out which is actually really cool.

96
00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:44.220
To make sure everything's working here under SPARC type in print.

97
00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:47.350
Alan than type.

98
00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:49.140
Hello world.

99
00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:51.710
This has to be in double quotes.

100
00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:52.340
Enter.

101
00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:53.990
You should see back Hello world.

102
00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:55.990
That means everything's working correctly for us.

103
00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.320
Which is exactly what we need.

104
00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:02.990
You now have Sparke Scala and Java all set up on your Ubuntu computer.

105
00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:06.510
Type in Colon due to quit out of this.

106
00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:12.570
Next let's show you how to install the Adam text editor which is the first ID will be working with.

107
00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:13.720
To start off with.

108
00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:17.340
When we're learning Skala we will actually not even be using an editor.

109
00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:22.840
We'll go line by line in Scala or Sparke shells prompt.

110
00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:28.610
But later on we will expand our knowledge to work of a text editor and then after that we will actually

111
00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:30.060
show you how to work with intelligence.

112
00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:38.590
But for now keeping things simple lets just go Adam text editor enter click on the first link it should

113
00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:44.410
be just Adam the IO and this will eventually take you to a downloads page and then once you're up this

114
00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:52.500
Web site just say download doc DCB and this will begin to download this db in a package for Adam say

115
00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:56.060
save file and then let that download.

116
00:08:56.110 --> 00:09:04.680
I'm going to jump ahead in time to finish downloading all right now that has finished downloading.

117
00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:06.980
Let's find the file right here.

118
00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:15.270
Adam and it say the file you can open up its file location in this case it's right here under Downloads.

119
00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:19.400
Once you've located the db file you can right click.

120
00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:25.200
You should be able to see open with software install click on that and this should eventually install

121
00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:27.060
your Adam software.

122
00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:35.670
So you should see a boon to software have it load up and then click install and this will go ahead and

123
00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:38.250
install the Adam as text editor.

124
00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:43.260
Once you have Adam text editor installed you may need to put in your password.

125
00:09:43.690 --> 00:09:49.750
So put that in and authenticate and now that we have Adam installed and open there's one last thing

126
00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:50.390
we need to do.

127
00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:55.210
And that's actually to install some packages that will help us program with Skala and Sparke.

128
00:09:55.210 --> 00:10:03.670
You can click here under install a package open installer and here you're going to search for Scala

129
00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:05.840
enter.

130
00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:08.210
It's going to be in searching packages for Skala.

131
00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:14.090
And then we want the skull language support and Adam that just should just be language that Skala click

132
00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:22.310
Install and that will install a skull in language support for this text editor meaning things such as

133
00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:29.280
code completion and text highlighting Once that has finished installing we want to install one more

134
00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:30.400
package.

135
00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:37.290
So go and search for terminal and we will install a package which will allow us to open a terminal right

136
00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:38.800
here in Adam.

137
00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:40.280
There's lots of options for this.

138
00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:41.850
I prefer this platform.

139
00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:46.260
IDG terminal so let's install that one.

140
00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:46.690
All right.

141
00:10:46.690 --> 00:10:51.850
Now that we have this terminal plug and download it let's show you how to create it an example Skoll

142
00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:53.800
script and click down here.

143
00:10:53.810 --> 00:10:54.760
There's a plus.

144
00:10:54.760 --> 00:11:00.080
They'll open up a new terminal and then we will go ahead and create an example Skull's script.

145
00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:07.420
So you'll just come up here you can close any of these savefile you file.

146
00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:15.530
And let's just say Prince Allen my first Skala script double quotes there.

147
00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:20.210
So this is just a print line command and we'll learn how to do a lot more Skala later on.

148
00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:22.380
And then down here where it says plain text.

149
00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:25.300
Click on that and then type in Scala.

150
00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:29.520
This will encode this to be a scholar and then you should see the syntax highlighting.

151
00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:30.630
Now we haven't saved this yet.

152
00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:38.270
So you can do control or command this and then save this we will save this as my first script.

153
00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:41.990
Skala keep things simple I'm just putting it right in my home directory.

154
00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:46.560
Save that and then let's show you how to run this file.

155
00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:49.120
I will say call that SPARC shell.

156
00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:55.800
In this case I need to call the whole folder path so I will say Sparke wherever that was and then been

157
00:11:56.370 --> 00:12:00.010
and then Sparke shell and you depending on where you are located in your terminal.

158
00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:04.230
You need to put in like home user slash Sparke.

159
00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:07.400
Hit enter that should load up the spark shell.

160
00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:12.080
As long as your folder locations are exactly the same as what I showed you earlier.

161
00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:17.250
This will then load up the spark shell in once that has loaded up.

We can just say Colan load and then type in the name of your script in this case it's my first script.

163
00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:26.420
Skala enter.

164
00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:29.380
And you should see my first script as the output.

165
00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:30.310
Perfect.

166
00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:35.230
So if you have any questions on this download and installation process feel free to post into the Q&amp;A

167
00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:35.880
forums.

168
00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:39.310
But make sure you do a search that Kewney forums and check out the written guide.

169
00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:44.710
As long as you follow it everything exactly as it should you should have been able to follow along with

170
00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:46.200
the exact same steps.

171
00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:46.930
All right.

172
00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:48.850
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
