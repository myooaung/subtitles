Hello everyone and I just wanted to let you know that coming up next is the Skala basics assessment

2
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:11,410
test.

3
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:15,550
Now this test is actually really simple it's just six very basic questions.

4
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:19,880
If you've been following along with the previous lectures it shouldn't be that hard.

5
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:24,380
So coming up next is just an article lecture that consists of the questions and then after that I'll

6
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:29,480
have a video walkthrough and you can also check out the notes for the questions themselves and the solutions

7
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,050
to the questions in case you want to read through it.

8
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:35,390
All right thanks everyone and best of luck on the assessment test.

00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:38,330
