Hello everyone and welcome to the project exercise overview lecture for the clustering of Sparke section

2
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:14,780
of the course and this lecture will have a brief overview of what you can expect for the project.

3
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:15,820
Exercise.

4
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,580
Let's jump to the script and get started.

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:18,890
All right.

6
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:19,780
Here I am.

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,020
I've opened up the Kamins underscore project underscore exercise thought Skala script and basically

8
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:30,210
we're going to be doing is trying to cluster clients of a wholesale distributor based off of the sales

9
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:35,700
of some sort of product categories and this data source actually comes from you see Irvine's machine

10
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,370
learning data set repository.

11
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:38,680
And there's a link here.

12
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:43,210
I'm going to copy and paste this into my browser and show you a little bit about it.

13
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:44,380
All right.

14
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:50,390
So if you go to that link it will take you here to use the eyes machine learning repository and UC Irvine

15
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:56,150
has a great repository of real data sets that you can access for free and play around with in order

16
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:58,170
to test machine learning algorithms.

17
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:03,300
And in this case we're going to be looking at a Portuguese data set on wholesale customer data.

18
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:08,930
And basically what this data set refers to is a wholesale distributor and it includes annual spending

19
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:16,040
on specific product categories and what you'll try to do is cluster them into specific regions.

20
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:23,290
So based off of spending information such as fresh milk grocery frozen delicatessen detergents cetera.

21
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:29,960
So how much the annual spending on fresh milk for particular regions you'll try to cluster them and

22
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,060
in this case we actually have three regions.

23
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:39,570
We have this one or Port-Au and then other regions so 316 77 and 47 for a total of 440.

24
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:43,370
And what you'll try to do is based off of these attributes.

25
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:46,790
See if you can cluster them into three specific regions.

26
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:50,590
Now keep in mind in this case you actually already have the label.

27
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:55,340
So you would technically already know the answer in order to treat this as an unsupervised learning

28
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:56,090
problem.

29
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:59,270
We're just going to be dealing with these first seven attributes.

30
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:01,830
Fresh milk grocery frozen delicatessen channel.

31
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,170
Cetera.

32
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:07,810
You can check out the actual download for the data set by clicking here on data folder.

33
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:12,340
And here's a CSP file and it should also be included under your clustering folder.

34
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:16,610
Now one more thing to know if you want to explore more about the machine learning repository you can

35
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:18,840
just click here to view all the data sets.

36
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:24,800
And here you can actually browse through based off default task data types area a number of instances

37
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,330
how all the data set is number of attributes etc..

38
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,290
So I encourage you to play around for a lot of these datasets.

39
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:34,730
They're really great to work with and gain some real experience working with real data.

40
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:39,860
Now let's jump back to the script and here we are back at the script and basically what you're going

41
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:44,390
to be doing it's just like the other project exercises you're going to complete the tasks below that

42
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:45,680
are commented out here.

43
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,180
So you're going to import a spark session create your clustering algorithm load the wholesale customer

44
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,550
data etc..

45
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:54,500
And in this case the following columns are going to be used for training.

46
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:59,380
You're just going to be using fresh milk grocery frozen detergents paper and delicatessen.

47
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:04,380
You actually use data channel or region data because that's essentially almost a label.

48
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:11,000
So you're just using based off of the sales of these various groups or products can you actually predict

49
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,830
what region they come from.

50
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:19,130
Then you're going to import vector assembler and vectors etc. create that features column create a Kamins

51
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:25,460
model and eventually just cluster the algorithm and show the result very close to what we did in the

52
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:29,440
actual example so you can refer to the example if you need a little bit of guidance.

53
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:33,280
And if you can't figure something out you can always refer to the solution script or to the solutions

54
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:35,180
video coming up next.

55
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:37,130
All right I hope you guys enjoy the project.

56
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:39,750
If you have any questions feel free to post the Q&amp;A forums.

57
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,920
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
