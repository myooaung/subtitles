Hello everyone and welcome to the clustering of Sparke section of the course.

2
00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:16.730
Clustering is an unsupervised learning task we're trying to cluster unlabelled data into similar groups.

3
00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:22.030
Now due to the nature of unsupervised learning algorithms in general it's usually quite hard to get

4
00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:26.150
a good metrics of performance for your actual learning algorithm.

5
00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:31.300
And this is really due to the fact that you don't have labels to check against your data already is

6
00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:36.820
unlabeled and essentially unsupervised learning algorithms are trying to create labels by clustering

7
00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.370
into smaller groups.

8
00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.670
So keep that in mind as we continue throughout this section of the course but we will show you some

9
00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:48.700
ways to actually get some metrics of performance but those metrics won't be as solid as the other metrics

10
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:53.740
you saw for things such as regression and classification supervised tasks where you can actually compare

11
00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.160
a prediction to the true label.

12
00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.850
In this case since your data is unlabelled you have no base to actually compare it to.

13
00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.200
You can only compare to how well your clusters are formed together.

14
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.230
For this clustering section of the course we're going to be focusing on using K means clustering which

15
00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:12.440
is one of the most common clustering algorithms.

16
00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.320
And in this course we're going to just have a light theory explanation so we'll discuss.

17
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.700
K means it's background and also give you a reading assignment that's optional if you want to go deeper

18
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:21.890
into the mathematics.

19
00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.100
We'll show the documentation example which is actually thorough enough that we don't need to have a

20
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.690
full walk through example.

21
00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.370
So right after the documentation example we'll set you loose on a project exercise so you can test out

22
00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:33.510
your new skills.

23
00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.000
OK.

24
00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.460
I'm excited to get started.

25
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.200
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
