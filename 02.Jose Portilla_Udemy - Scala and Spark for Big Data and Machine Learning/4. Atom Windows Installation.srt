00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:12,190
Hello everyone and welcome to the Skala and spark development environments lecture in this lecture.

2
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,310
We're going to be showing you various options for development environments.

3
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:20,730
However before we get started I want you to know that you should feel free to choose whatever environment

4
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,650
you personally prefer.

5
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:26,390
Let's go ahead and discuss our approach to maximize learning in this course.

6
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:33,160
For this course we're actually going to start off just by using the REPL or read evaluate print's loop

7
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,210
interpreter.

8
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:39,910
Then we're going to go ahead and move on to using a basic text editor with some Skala plugins and that

9
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:44,680
text editor will be Adam then we're finally going to move on to a fool idea.

10
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:50,740
Again you don't have to follow these steps but these particular pathways from going to the interpreter

11
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:55,660
to a text editor to a fool ideally should maximize your learning process.

12
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:59,580
But if you want you can also just start with the Fool ID.

13
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,630
Let's go ahead and get started by jumping to our browser showing you the options and then walking you

14
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:11,110
through how to download our first text editor Adam OK here I am at the browser.

15
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:16,070
The first idea I want to discuss is the Scala ideally for Eclipse.

16
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:20,450
Now if you've programmed in Java or maybe some other languages you're already familiar with Eclipse

17
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:21,250
Scala.

18
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:27,560
Id eat basically allows you to have a Scala ID with Eclipse and you can go ahead and check out this

19
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,220
Web site.

20
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:33,340
It says Skala that idea or has lots of features and documentations.

21
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:40,790
It's definitely a full blown I.T. with features editing debugging highlighting etc. and it's something

22
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:41,830
she definitely check out.

23
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:48,440
If you're interested in using a more professional Skala ID is probably the most popular Skala ID on

24
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:51,580
the market and it's free.

25
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:57,810
The next idea I want to talk about is Intel A-J idea from Jet brains or idea.

26
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:02,400
And this is a Java idea but it's actually more than just Java.

27
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:05,410
You can scroll down and check out the various languages it supports.

28
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:08,930
But again this is a full ID development environment.

29
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:13,940
It's going to look a lot like pi charm if you're familiar that for Python that it has what you would

30
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:21,400
expect code completion frameworks specific assistance things to help you debug intelligence built in.

31
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:23,890
And like I mentioned it supports Skala.

32
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:29,330
This is the idea we're going to be using later on this course so you can go ahead and scroll down and

33
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:31,090
download the community edition.

34
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:35,540
You can do this now or wait till we actually approach this later on this course.

35
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:38,720
It's quite a large download so we'll just leave it at that for now.

36
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:44,630
Later on we're going to come back to this and actually show you how to use this for larger programs

37
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:45,760
and tasks.

38
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:49,560
For now we're going to go ahead and move on to text editors.

39
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:55,430
This is the link for sublime text you can find the sublime text dot com sublime text is just a text

40
00:02:55,460 --> 00:03:02,740
editor for code markup and prose and it works for a variety of languages and basically state text editor.

41
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:07,760
It's not a full blown idea in the sense that it has debugging capabilities but it does support things

42
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,870
such as syntax highlighting.

43
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:13,230
It's a very famous text editor is probably one of the most popular out there.

44
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:18,260
So if you program in something before you may even already have sublime text the text editor we're going

45
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:21,110
to be using for this course however is Adam.

46
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,280
Adam is from the developers at hub.

47
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:30,290
It's also a text editor but it has some really nice plug ins for Skala which we're going to be using.

48
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:35,800
So Adam is the text editor will be using throughout this course before we jump to an idea.

49
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:40,180
I'm going to go ahead and click download here in order to begin the Adam download.

50
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:42,960
It's a little lighter than Skala.

51
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,170
Ian Intelli J.

52
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,120
ITA.

53
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:51,080
So it's about ninety one point five megabytes will take maybe a few minutes to download.

54
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,490
I'm going to go ahead and jump to the finished download.

55
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:54,130
All right.

56
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:55,810
So the Dalat has completed.

57
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:58,170
Let's go ahead and open up that executable file.

58
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:03,320
Ok when you click that you should see Adam beginning to install and it's going to launch.

59
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:09,660
Once it's done I'm going to go ahead and jump forward to the finished installation process.

60
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,030
OK.

61
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:11,300
This is what Adam looks like.

62
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:17,780
Once it's done installing it's text editor will go ahead and make this full screen here so he can explore

63
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:18,910
it a little bit.

64
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,690
We're going to go ahead and check out the welcome guide.

65
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:26,780
What I want you to go ahead and do is click here on install a package you can later checkout.

66
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:31,200
Choosing a theme for coloring customized in the styling such as font etc..

67
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:34,920
Well let's go ahead and say install a package and we're going to import.

68
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:35,390
Scuse me.

69
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:37,210
Open installer.

70
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:45,250
And then here under install packages I want you to search for Scala and try to search it's going to

71
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:51,620
search packages for Skala and you should see here language dash Scala Skala language support.

72
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:55,180
Adam you'll go ahead and click here to install that.

73
00:04:55,480 --> 00:05:01,930
And basically the really cool aspect of Adam is that it's open source and there's also a lot of support

74
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:05,170
in community around this specific text editor.

75
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:10,710
So a lot of people create really cool packages and plug ins for this text editor for various languages.

76
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:16,720
Now it already has most languages at least the common ones built in as far as syntax highlighting.

77
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:23,380
But you can go ahead and check out under here install under settings to check various packages that

78
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:26,770
maybe aren't default installed into Adam.

79
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,350
OK.

80
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:31,200
So once we have that installed we're basically ready to go.

81
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:44,130
You can just click file new file and then let's go ahead and say Say Prince l an double quotes.

82
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:45,660
Hello world.

83
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:51,550
The book quotes there and I'm going to go ahead and come down here where it says plain text.

84
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:57,260
Click on that and then start typing Skala to make sure this is actually a scholar file and you should

85
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:01,190
see now that the syntax highlighting has changed for print line.

86
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:06,110
Now we can see the hello world is a string and it's going to give us just enough help so that we don't

87
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:08,600
feel overwhelmed by a fool either.

88
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:13,000
We're also not totally lost if a blank text editor which is a really nice balance.

89
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:19,380
At this stage of our learning so we're going to go ahead and save this we'll save file save as and you

90
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,660
can save this basically wherever you want.

91
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:27,340
Let's go ahead and make a new folder and save it under Sparke.

92
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:36,510
So good to see Dr good to spark here and I'm going to make a new folder click new folder and call it

93
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:48,900
my programs open up this folder here and then I want to call this my underscore first program and then

94
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,040
hit save.

95
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:50,690
OK.

96
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:54,600
Now let's actually show you how to run this program code.

97
00:06:54,610 --> 00:07:00,690
This my first program I'll go ahead and go to your command prompt again you can just search for it by

98
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:07,380
typing a command prompt you should see this pop up and then you're going to CD to that folder where

99
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:08,030
it was saved.

100
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:16,950
In this case it's my programs so we can see the two or change the directory to see Colin back slash

101
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:25,520
spark and then we'll go back to see the my programs and I just did tab to autocomplete there.

102
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:33,010
And now under my programs I'm going to go ahead and start my Sparc shell enter.

103
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:38,460
This may take a little bit of time to load up but basically once you have spark shell I will show you

104
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:41,490
how to load up that file you just made.

105
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:43,370
OK so here's the spark shell.

106
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:47,250
We can see that the Skala are EPL is ready and loaded.

107
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:51,130
So let's go ahead and load this program file not to do that.

108
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:51,780
You just do.

109
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:58,160
Colin load and then type in my first program.

110
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,390
So remember this has to match exactly as you saved it.

111
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:08,040
So we're going to say Colin Lote's space my underscore first underscore program is going to load up

112
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:11,160
my first program and then it prints out Hello world.

113
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:11,890
Great.

114
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:17,860
Let's go ahead and confirm that this is actually working by editing our first program file.

115
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:24,410
So we'll go ahead and change this print line to something that says maybe new line.

116
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:28,920
So we'll say new line.

117
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:30,890
We'll go ahead and save that control.

118
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:33,470
S come back to the command prompt.

119
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:43,320
And then type in again colon load my first underscore program enter.

120
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:46,040
Now we can see that it outputs new line.

121
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:46,700
All right.

122
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,390
Great.

123
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:52,340
So let's go ahead and quickly review what we discussed in this lecture in this lecture we showed you

124
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:54,510
various ideal options.

125
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:57,130
And then we showed you a few text editor options.

126
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:03,260
We showed you how to install Adam as a text editor how to download the Scala plug in for Adam and then

127
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:06,950
how to actually run your very first program of Scala code.

128
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:12,590
Coming up next as we deal with the very basics of Scala Roxi just going to go and input right at the

129
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:14,540
interpreter Scala code.

130
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:19,790
Later on we'll move on to actually using the text editor that we've set up here for now as we continue

131
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:21,050
on through the very basics.

132
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:24,050
We're just going to actually put stuff straight into the interpreter.

133
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:25,800
OK thanks everyone.

134
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:28,950
Do you have any questions feel free to post them to the Kewney forums.

135
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:29,990
I'll see you at the next lecture.
