Hello everyone.

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:06,730
Welcome to the project.

3
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:11,100
Exercise overview lecture for the classification section of the Course.

4
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:15,630
This lecture will briefly go over the project exercise and the questions you have to answer.

5
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:18,290
We're going to jump to the exercise script now.

6
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:19,490
OK here I am.

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,530
I've opened the log Regg project Skala.

8
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:27,500
It's under the classification folder and basically in this project what you're going to be working with

9
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:32,840
is a fake advertising dataset which indicates whether or not a particular internet user clicked on an

10
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,130
advertisement.

11
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:38,420
We're going to try to create a model that will predict whether or not they will click on an ad based

12
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:42,740
off the features of that user and this data set contains the following features.

13
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:45,420
It has a feature column for daily time spent on the site.

14
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:48,430
So that's the consumer time on a particular Web site in minutes.

15
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:54,230
The age of the customer in years the average income of geographical area of that customer the average

16
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:57,710
minutes a day consumer or that customer is on the internet.

17
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:02,240
Then there's an ad topic line which is this a string the headline of the actual advertisement.

18
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:08,030
The city of the consumer customer mail which just indicates whether or not the consumer was male the

19
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:13,970
country of the consumer a time stamp and then clicked on AD 0 or 1 in the kid and clicking on ad that's

20
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:19,520
basically your label there what you want to do is actually build a logistic regression model that based

21
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:25,130
off of all these features can you predict whether or not clicked on ad is a zero or one and basically

22
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:27,260
just complete the commented tasks below.

23
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:34,130
You get the data do some exploration of the data display the data set up the data frame for machine

24
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:34,700
learning.

25
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:36,490
There's some stuff you have to do.

26
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:39,530
Import vector assembler etc. do a random split.

27
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:42,450
Set up the pipeline and then evaluate the model.

28
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:44,840
OK that's basically all there is to it.

29
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,630
Best of luck.

30
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:46,580
If you have any questions.

31
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:48,480
Make sure to check out the solutions lecture.

32
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:49,610
Coming up next.

33
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:51,410
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
