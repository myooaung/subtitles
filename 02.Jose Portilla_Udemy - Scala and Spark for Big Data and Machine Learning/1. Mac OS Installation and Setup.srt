00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:07,060
Hello everyone and welcome to this lecture on the skull and Sparke Mac OS installation.

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:10,260
Make sure you check out the resource link for this lecture.

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,830
That's what we're going to be walking through in this lecture.

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:17,620
It contains fully written instructions on how to install everything that includes Java.

5
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:22,680
Scala Sparke it's dependencies and this lecture will explain these steps.

6
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:27,180
Walk you through that resource link and then we will show you how to install the Adam text editor which

7
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:31,650
will be using later on in the course and how to run a simple Skala script.

8
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:34,440
Let's get started by going to that resource link.

9
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,500
I'm going to jump to that link now.

10
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,050
OK here I am at the research link.

11
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:44,030
It's just a blog post and I will make sure this blog post is updated in case any changes happen.

12
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:49,140
As far as the installation process goes but everything here should be basically up to today already

13
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,300
in order to install Skala and Apache's SPARC.

14
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:57,750
There's a lot of dependencies we need to install and usually this is actually really difficult on Mac

15
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:04,040
OS systems but a system or program called homebrew makes your life a lot easier.

16
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:10,710
So what you will do is go to this Web site which is going to be brewed S H and it will tell you how

17
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:11,990
to install homebrew.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,730
It's basically just go to your terminal and in case you don't know how to use your terminal use click

19
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:23,640
command space spacebar type in terminal and paste will copy and paste this into your terminal.

20
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,060
And this single line will basically install homebrew for you.

21
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:32,590
Once you've installed homebrew that's the first step you're going to maybe install X code select.

22
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:36,840
So in order to install a Java Scala and Spark's to the command line which will be doing you will probably

23
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,580
need to install X code select.

24
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:43,710
If you haven't done so already for some other programming language that's actually quite easy you just

25
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:49,320
go to your terminal and type X code that select space dash dash install and you can just copy and paste

26
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,130
these commands from the resource link to your terminal.

27
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:57,280
You may get a prompt that looks something like this asking you to install command line developer tools.

28
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:01,180
Go ahead and click install on that link once you have that setup.

29
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,310
It's time to use homebrewed to install Java Skala is dependent on Java.

30
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:10,270
As we've previously discussed the easiest way to install Java again is just use homebrew.

31
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:15,300
So once you've installed the homebrew at your command line you just type in Brue task install Java and

32
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,510
it will automatically install a job for you.

33
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:19,110
It may prompt you for your password.

34
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:21,120
So make sure you have that ready.

35
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:24,140
Once you have Java installed you can install Skala again.

36
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:28,140
Really easy to just say Brue install Skala and type them into your terminal.

37
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:33,240
It should automatically install sculped for you then you just use homebrewed to install Apache Sparke.

38
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:34,500
Again very easy.

39
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:39,560
You say Brue install Apache dash Sparc and they will automatically download and install Apache Sparc

40
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,980
and that may take some time.

41
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:43,830
These are not very small files or kind of large.

42
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,920
So depending on your internet connection that Dalat installation process may take some time.

43
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:53,280
Once that's ready to go you should be able to use SPARC shell at your terminal command line.

44
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:58,950
What's really nice about homebrew is it will automatically add all these commands to your path or to

45
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:01,160
your source file that bash RC file.

46
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:06,570
That way you can call SPARC shell from anywhere once you type in SPARC shell you should see a flood

47
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:10,840
of text and warnings but eventually see something like this that says welcome to spark.

48
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:15,720
And then you'll have a Skala input there and you can confirm that it's working by typing in something

49
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,710
like this.

50
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:20,860
Let's go ahead and jump to the terminal and show you how that works.

51
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:26,370
At the end of this resource link there's also a common issue homebrews should automatically take care

52
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,740
of adding things to your path in bash but in case you need to copy this or you want to add the python

53
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,120
Bash as well.

54
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,730
You can just copy and paste these two lines into your terminal.

55
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,710
That should take care of it all right.

56
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:46,800
Let's jump to the terminal and show you how the sparks shell should actually look I'm going to say terminal.

57
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,450
So here I am at my terminal.

58
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,990
You should be able to just say SPARC shell.

59
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,990
After installing everything this should work.

60
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:57,490
And you will see some warnings there.

61
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,600
Don't worry about those later on the course.

62
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,600
We will show you how to adjust the warning level.

63
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:08,180
SPARC is kind of notorious for showing you a warning for every single little thing but we'll show you

64
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:14,600
later on how to actually add a line to your script to only get output for severe errors or warnings.

65
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:15,840
You should see something like this.

66
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,680
And then finally see the sparks shell.

67
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:24,820
And just to make sure everything's working can say Prince L-N open parentheses and then type in something

68
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:25,050
like.

69
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:28,730
Hello world McCarry using double quotes here.

70
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,270
Enter And there is.

71
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,360
Hello world.

72
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,550
And that is your Sparke shell running Skala and in this case I'm running version two point eleven.

73
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:42,760
Make sure that the spark version you are using is 2.00 or higher in order to use everything that we

74
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:45,610
do in this course to quit this SPARC shell.

75
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:49,320
All you have to do is say colon Q And then hit enter.

76
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,810
That will bring you back to your home directory.

77
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:56,960
Now let's go ahead and show you how to install the Adam text editor.

78
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:59,560
We won't be using the text editor immediately.

79
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:03,550
We will use it later on in the course of learning about data frames and then later on after that we'll

80
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:08,530
jump to and tell you J ID or other ID options and then after that I'll show you how to use notebooks.

81
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:13,450
But for now since we're already installing things let's show you how to install the Adam text editor

82
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:18,440
and what plugins you need to add the Adam text editor.

83
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,760
Once you're at this Web site you will be at the Web site for atom.

84
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,450
I know this is a really useful text editor.

85
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:31,340
We won't use it at first but we will gradually evolve to doing full Skala scripts in our Adam text editor.

86
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:36,360
If you don't have it already just click on this download for Mac and it will automatically download

87
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:40,610
the DMG file that you'll need for installing this text editor.

88
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,110
It's one of my favorite text editors.

89
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:45,470
Again as I've mentioned before you're free to use whatever idea you want.

90
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:51,150
If you want to jump straight into Intelli J ideally or something like Scala ID for Eclipse.

91
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,710
Those are all viable options.

92
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:54,790
Feel free to choose what feels right to you.

93
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:59,910
But if you're just starting out like this course assumes you are we will gradually introduce more and

94
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:02,440
more ideas and text editors as we go along.

95
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:05,120
So just download for Mac.

96
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:08,400
I've already downloaded this so I will jump to the Adam text editor.

97
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:13,050
I'll open it up and I will show you two plug ins that you need to install to make sure everything works

98
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:14,600
correctly with Scala.

99
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:17,850
I'm going to jump to the Adam text editor now.

100
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,500
All right here is what Adam text editor looks like.

101
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:26,390
A lot of times the first time you open it you should see some sort of welcome message but what we want

102
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:30,680
to do is show you how to install plugins which is one of the best features of ADOM in my opinion.

103
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:36,280
Just come here to Adam go to preferences and you should see something that looks like this.

104
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:42,580
Under settings what you want to do is click here on install and here you can install packages or plug

105
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:46,010
ins to actually enhance the text editor.

106
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:47,900
There's two main plugins we need to do.

107
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:56,620
As far as installation type in Skala and enter into install packages and what we want you to do is install

108
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:58,390
language Dasch Scala.

109
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,660
All you have to do is click on the Install button.

110
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,770
I already have it installed so I don't need to do that.

111
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:04,520
But this is your first time using it.

112
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,190
They'll be a little blue Insall button.

113
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:08,150
Go ahead and click on that.

114
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:15,420
When you have this language Skala installed the next thing I need to install is a terminal package.

115
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:16,760
So just come here.

116
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:23,210
Type in terminal enter to search and there are a lot of terminal packages for Adam.

117
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:26,480
They're all pretty good but my favorite is this platform you.

118
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:28,380
Dash ID dash terminal.

119
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,440
So I would recommend just installing that one.

120
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:34,020
Some of these other terminals sometimes are buggy between operating systems.

121
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:39,410
I've found that platform Real ID the terminal works across pretty much all the operating systems I've

122
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:41,420
been to Windows and Mac.

123
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:45,460
Which is why I recommend to install this platform ID terminal.

124
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:50,820
Once you have those two installed you should be ready to go as far as running a scarlet script.

125
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,880
So let's show you how to do that.

126
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:55,700
You can go ahead and say file new file.

127
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:57,930
In this case I already have an untitled one here.

128
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:08,150
I will do a simple print Ellen and say my first Skala script close print CS note that right now we're

129
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:13,490
not getting any syntax highlighting what you need to do is come down here to the bottom right it plain

130
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:19,310
text and then type in Scala and you can see the syntax highlighting.

131
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:24,730
And now we will also save this so I will say file save as

132
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:30,260
it's going to say this to my desktop.

133
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:39,390
I will say my first script scholar and I will save that file.

134
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:44,430
And then in order to actually open up a terminal inside of Adam what you can do is just click here on

135
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:45,550
this plus sign.

136
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:49,350
And this plus sign should show up once you've installed that terminal.

137
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:57,150
Here I am at my desktop so I will call Sparke shell enter later on as the course progresses we will

138
00:08:57,150 --> 00:09:02,400
show you how to use things such as Spark's submit or even SPARC notebooks up in the cloud.

139
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,970
Right now we want to keep things simple.

140
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:09,310
So we will keep with SPARC shell once everything's loaded up.

141
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:10,750
Let me jump to that now.

142
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:17,740
You should see something that looks like this welcome to spark and then to load a scholar a script you

143
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:21,140
just say call and load and then type in the name of your skulls script.

144
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:29,590
This case it's my first script Scala hit enter and you'll see my first script whatever this output was.

145
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:30,000
All right.

146
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,490
That's really all there is to it.

147
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:34,210
Just follow the directions in the resource link.

148
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:39,280
I can't really walk you through the directions here on this computer because a lot of the stuff is already

00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:44,020
installed so it may look a little buggy and I don't want to confuse you but everything that you need

150
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:46,960
to type is basically already in that resource link.

151
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,210
So just open it up.

152
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,030
Follow through.

153
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:51,480
Make sure the instructions are followed in the correct order.

154
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:55,500
And if you have any questions feel free to post the Kewaunee forums I'm here to help out.

00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:57,930
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
