1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:01,910
All right welcome back my students.

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,810
So that makes this lecture super easy.

3
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:07,970
We're going to add a band here that would close the box whenever we want so that way this thing is never

4
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:09,900
it's not open all the time.

5
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:10,380
All right.

6
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:17,660
So let's go ahead and do that real quick let's go all the way to the top and right here we've got and

7
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:19,430
we Empress's that BHB by the way.

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,510
Let's use.

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,190
Called his bun close.

10
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:23,700
I don't know.

11
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:24,700
That's a bull.

12
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:25,750
I haven't used it.

13
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:26,040
But

14
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:29,880
that's it.

15
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:30,480
All right.

16
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:33,810
And there you go all the way to the bottom here.

17
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,100
We don't need to actually

18
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:47,220
write all that if we don't want to have a whole bunch of different ways that we can do this but we can't

19
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:50,270
even attach it to the send button.

20
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:51,710
Close by.

21
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:52,700
There we go.

22
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:55,850
And I need to be honest.

23
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,810
Just this click event here

24
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:02,510
tag right here.

25
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:07,960
You can remove it from the Dohm if you want it to.

26
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:09,070
Would a function.

27
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:12,780
But we can also hide it.

28
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:13,400
So

29
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:22,560
between is ID.

30
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:25,340
So let's check it out real quick to see if it works.

31
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,180
All right.

32
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:29,280
We need to take these we're hello out of there.

33
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:31,510
This is the lead.

34
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:35,290
But anyway this barn right here with click click it and it's closed.

35
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:36,070
All right.

36
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:37,120
So

37
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,010
there we go.

38
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:43,560
What else

39
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:57,570
oh hello word.

40
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,780
All right.

41
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,480
Beautiful beautiful.

42
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:02,140
Click it.

43
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:05,580
Gone we go.

44
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:05,930
Actually

45
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:11,380
we're computer guys.

46
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:20,160
Computer update record was updated.

47
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:27,440
It can go to Friday's update as well on the fly and we can search our database for that specific Honda

48
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,780
winking at it.

49
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:34,910
Lamborghini intercessors.

50
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:35,500
You spell it.

51
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:36,170
Maybe not.

52
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,140
There we go.

53
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:44,560
Can select it from here and delete it.

54
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:56,080
Of course we might want to work on this here because it's actually being shown right now.

55
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,940
But we can take that off and fix it.

56
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,750
All right.

57
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:04,390
Anyway I'm not going to work them out right now.

58
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:09,260
I'll work on them on that next lectures.

59
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:10,430
All right.

60
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:15,770
Meanwhile just remove this wants you.

61
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:16,860
You'll show it.

62
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:18,890
It should be easy.

63
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:21,110
Or when you actually close it down.

64
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:26,480
You can remove the anyway.

65
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,860
Thank you so much for watching.

66
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:32,930
When the next lectures and hopefully I'll make some more lectures and make more there's more events.

67
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,880
Bye Bye bye.

68
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,690
Now this course is finish.

69
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:41,870
You know I did what I promised the cross functionalities here and whatever comes after this is really

70
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:46,580
really really extra lectures that I haven't even promise you yet.

71
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:47,180
All right.

72
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:52,650
I just say I might make some more and actual lectures and I like doing that to all my courses.

73
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,450
Thank you so much for the support.

74
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:57,470
If you are happy with the course don't forget to give me some reviews.

75
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:03,410
I love seeing my students reviewing my course and again it's a pleasure and I'll see you in the next

76
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,350
lectures or courses.

77
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:05,800
Take care.
