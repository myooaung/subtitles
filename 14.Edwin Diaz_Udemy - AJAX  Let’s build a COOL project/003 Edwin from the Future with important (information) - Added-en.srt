1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:01,200
I will come back.

2
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:07,830
My name is Edwin and of course you already met me but you met my other me from the past.

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:13,520
I'm from the future and I come by once in a while just to add a couple more lectures to the course.

4
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:16,880
I hope you don't mind me coming to the out more lectures.

5
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:21,860
I think that gives you a better value for your time and the money that you spend for this course.

6
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:24,500
So if you don't mind me being around.

7
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:27,390
Dand good if you mind me being around.

8
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:30,060
Send me a message and I'll handle any issues you got.

9
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:36,990
But anyway on this section here we are going to be creating a database we are going to be learning how

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,890
Ajax works with Jake werie.

11
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:45,720
But before we do that I also added some new lectures to introduce to introduce you to javascript to

12
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:49,500
do in jets with pure javascript.

13
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,010
I think you should know that foundation before you jump into Ageod's.

14
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:54,420
All right.

15
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,790
So I'm adding those two lectures here.

16
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:00,710
Well you know my other me from the past told me to do that.

17
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,930
So really cool.

18
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:08,430
But anyway for those of you that are here for some reason and don't know Ph be.

19
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,880
Ph be.

20
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:12,920
I don't want you to actually miss out on this.

21
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:18,150
You shouldn't ph be for this course but if you don't don't worry you can still follow a norm even though

22
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:22,010
you might now understand the BHB PSI or the Cheikh where we say.

23
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:24,740
But you can follow along with everything I type.

24
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:28,230
All right so all you have to have is a local environment.

25
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:32,220
So if you already know what I'm talking about and you know BHB you can skip this lecture.

26
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:32,670
All right.

27
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:37,760
If not go ahead and keep watching because I'm going to show you how to set it up.

28
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:46,930
So basically you will find something like Zap line which is a software package that will install a couple

29
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:47,670
of things for us.

30
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:54,260
It we install BHB at bacci in my school that we are going to need in the course you install it.

31
00:01:54,410 --> 00:02:00,290
Then you turn it on with an application that he has inside once you install the cold the control manager

32
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:02,130
or something like Application Manager.

33
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:07,410
Make sure that you my squill database is running are you Apache is running right.

34
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:13,510
And does the same thing for another software package called wimp bright.

35
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,450
There are a couple of them.

36
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:15,770
These are the big ones.

37
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:16,780
Lamp.

38
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,880
That's another one that you can stuff windows.

39
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:22,870
And there's another one for Mac and Windows as well called.

40
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:25,430
All right.

41
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,700
So these are the software packages.

42
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:28,800
You install it.

43
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:32,980
Make sure that you go in the Control Panel make sure that those services are on your mind.

44
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,110
You know you have Patchi and all that.

45
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:41,920
And then once you have a radio you have to go and visit your your browser and type in localhost.

46
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:46,300
This is going to give you your server directory basically.

47
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:49,690
This is where you're going to be placing all those files to make them work.

48
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:54,590
For example the application that will build and coal is in a folder called Ajax Demel and this is where

49
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:55,320
it is.

50
00:02:55,640 --> 00:03:00,800
All right localhost forward slash the folder name where your application is.

51
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:01,160
All right.

52
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:09,320
I'm also using an editor call it the cold brackets which is free for Windows Linux and Mac users.

53
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:10,010
Right.

54
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:12,590
So once you have the local environment ready.

55
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,160
All right.

56
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,650
For Windows users this is going to install the in a folder called zap.

57
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,160
Right.

58
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:21,390
And you Feigel in my Mac this is my Mac but it's very similar.

59
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:27,560
So if I go to my applications now all my files my application you're going to find you're going to find

60
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:33,220
a full decode zem for Windows users this will be you see Dr. for Mac users.

61
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:35,620
Obviously it would be an complications.

62
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,740
So when you click on this folder and you have another folder called HD docs This is where all those

63
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:44,280
folder that I just showed you in the browser will be located at.

64
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,600
This is where we will store our project.

65
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:50,040
As you can see right here that Demel they juts underscored Demel.

66
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:50,640
All right.

67
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:56,750
And what I am going to do later on in the lecture is I'm going to make a shortcut and put it on my desktop

68
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:00,300
from the docs so that way we can create a project right here right.

69
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,430
This was a fast overview.

70
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:08,220
For those of you that for some reason did not get my warning about not getting into the cores on lets

71
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,500
you know BHB.

72
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:12,140
All right but I didn't want you to miss out.

73
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,210
Thank you so much.

74
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:19,320
And on the next lectures I'm going to explain to you how javascript works with AJAX.

75
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:22,260
All right and then we'll continue with the rest of the course.

76
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,070
Thank you so much and I'll see you then.
