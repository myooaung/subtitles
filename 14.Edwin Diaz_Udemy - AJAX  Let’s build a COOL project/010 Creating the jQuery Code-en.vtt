00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:06.950

Hi welcome back my dear students on this lecture you were going to finally start creating the Jake where



2

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.460

we ask him to allow us to communicate with our local server.



3

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:11.790

All right.



4

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.620

I'm going to take up this window seat since we don't need it anymore.



5

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:16.440

All right.



6

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.780

So now actually let's just open up our best friend.



7

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:24.660

You my best friend because he lets me find everything I like.



8

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:25.130

All right.



9

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:31.750

We're going to be using something called the dot Ajax and you can look it up right here.



10

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.580

This from Jake where we're going to take you to Jake Web site.



11

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.940

And here you can see all the parameters that we can pass to this agent.



12

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:45.710

All right what this is going to do is going to perform a asynchronous HTP requests.



13

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:46.880

Right.



14

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.440

It's going to communicate in other words is going to communicate with our server.



15

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:50.970

All right.



16

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.930

So we get to we can pass a couple of parameters there as you can.



17

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.550

You're welcome to to read this documentation here.



18

00:00:58.370 --> 00:00:59.070

Rice.



19

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.100

If you don't know Jake where this might look very confusing.



20

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.770

Don't worry I'm going to just show you how to use this.



21

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:07.310

All right.



22

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.190

So let's go ahead and start using it.



23

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.100

As Bernard coeditor.



24

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.110

And now we created this markup here in the last part.



25

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.890

So now it's time for us to start creating our Jake werie cold right.



26

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.240

So now that we have all this mark up here I'm just going to tighten things up a little bit.



27

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.340

Right right here inside that document that dot ready.



28

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:41.590

Let's create the start Jake Weary right so we start square with a dollar sign of course parentheses



29

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:51.940

and what we want to target here is we need to get the value of this input here so when people typing



30

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.240

here will get some type of value.



31

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:00.330

All right saved somewhere and we need to save it into a variable.



32

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:08.790

So we are going to be targeting this input with a class of ID and this is how we're going to get this



33

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:09.940

value with this idea.



34

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.260

So we're going to grab it.



35

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:19.390

So we're going to say Jake where we listen look for the IDs search.



36

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.380

All right name search and I want you to do something with it.



37

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.360

Jake are those you know right now what we want and what we wanted to do right.



38

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.690

So we're going to say look when somebody types in something.



39

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.630

But I want you to do something.



40

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:36.380

All right.



41

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:42.720

So this something is a function right here that is going to do something for us.



42

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:43.460

Right.



43

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.410

So let's put the function down a little bit there.



44

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.340

So Jacqui what is it that you want me to do.



45

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.620

Can you put it in between these brackets please as well and can you do that.



46

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.630

Well there we go then.



47

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.940

All right.



48

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:06.150

So I want you to make a variable called search and I want you to grab that box search with the search



49

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:13.370

element with ID search and I want you to say the value of it.



50

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.730

There we go.



51

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.150

Isn't that beautiful.



52

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:17.910

Right.



53

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:23.740

And we can go ahead and test it out and say you know what test it out.



54

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.830

By alerting it.



55

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.480

So let's go ahead and do that right now.



56

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:36.330

Go save it then we go we put an F and we get the f right here on the alert.



57

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.970

See what they queue up does.



58

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:40.260

He alerts everything.



59

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.050

Now it's the there we go.



60

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.690

Perfect.



61

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:45.700

All right.



62

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.310

So I think that it's working really good.



63

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:49.870

What do you think.



64

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:50.320

All right.



65

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:54.520

So now that we know he's working let's go ahead and continue let's just delete that and continue with



66

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:57.360

our code right.



67

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:03.690

So the next thing is right that upshift that element that I was telling you about age that's right.



68

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:04.900

That age that's



69

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:09.230

like this.



70

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.200

And we're going to put it down a little bit.



71

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:12.850

And we go then.



72

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.140

And then we can use this.



73

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:22.600

You are all here just to tell what page we won this request to go to.



74

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:23.090

All right.



75

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.870

So we wanted this request to go to that BHB because what we're going to be doing is we're going to be



76

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:33.840

sending some data right to that page and we're going to pull it from there.



77

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.440

We're going to send out requests and that request is going to come back to us.



78

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:43.700

So let's send it to search dot BHB that's where we're sending it.



79

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:47.100

We're going to put a comb on because we're going to put some of the parameters in here and we're going



80

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:52.860

to say look I want you to send this data that is type of what.



81

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.260

Well not it's not Type-B and we're not there yet.



82

00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:01.000

Let's just put data and send that with a key of search.



83

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.480

All right.



84

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:04.020

And send the variable search with it.



85

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:05.850

That's what we're doing right now.



86

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:13.690

What we were saying is send this key where I want you to use that in your post pro-global or super global



87

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:17.930

and then send it send this variable with it.



88

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:18.760

All right.



89

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:27.340

So that's all we're doing here and we're going to put a coma and now we are going to say type a now



90

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:30.490

here we can put get or post whatever you want.



91

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:31.850

Really doesn't matter.



92

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:35.450

I'm just going to post I'm just so used to it.



93

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:45.430

And now we're going to also pass in the success full back here function.



94

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:50.420

But make a function here real quick.



95

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:51.150

All right.



96

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:52.540

Is perfect.



97

00:05:52.540 --> 00:06:00.670

Now let's also pass the variable here because we're going to need it and we're going to say something



98

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:01.180

like



99

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:09.570

If not data dot error



100

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:21.030

then I want you to grab basically what we're saying here is if you don't have an end narrow here right



101

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.190

then I want you to do this.



102

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:25.560

So that's what we're going to be doing.



103

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:27.960

Making sure that we don't have no errors there.



104

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:32.530

This is just a simple way of doing this is a lot of ways actually validating this but this is the most



105

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:35.020

simplest way possible.



106

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:35.400

All right.



107

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:40.070

So we're going to grab the search right here.



108

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:46.750

The Elliman with the search and we're going to insert actually now the search one we're going to grab.



109

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:53.500

We made a empty H2 here what we're going to be placing the data that's going to come back from our server.



110

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:57.200

This is where we're going to be placing it right here.



111

00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:57.960

All right.



112

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:01.510

So that's why this H2 is empty right now.



113

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:05.430

We're grabbing the stuff from here sending the request to the server.



114

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:10.850

And then when it comes back it's going to come here so we need this idea actually.



115

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:16.720

And we are going to be putting it right here in sounds good right.



116

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:22.960

And we're going to be using this HD mail just to insert the amount in there because that's what you



117

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:24.380

do with Jake right.



118

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:27.500

So we're going to insert this data that is coming in.



119

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:29.020

All right.



120

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:31.190

So that looks perfect.



121

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:36.570

All right on that next one we're going to continue this because this lecture is getting kind of long.



122

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:40.960

So I'm just going to go a little slower there and maybe you can see the whole thing and you can just



123

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:42.090

copy it.



124

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:43.810

Make sure that you have everything there.



125

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:45.380

Now I haven't tested this too.



126

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:49.110

Just make sure that we don't have any errors there so.



127

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:50.590

But on the next video we're going to do that.



128

00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:51.190

All right.



129

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:55.270

So thank you so much for watching this lecture was a pleasure again.



130

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:57.370

And looking forward to see you in the next one.



131

00:07:57.370 --> 00:07:57.850

Take care.



132

00:07:57.850 --> 00:07:59.070

Have an awesome day.
