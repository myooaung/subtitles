1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,090
All right welcome back my students.

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:07,350
So it's time for us to start actually spending a little bit more than hello to our application right

3
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:10,140
to our boss right here.

4
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:13,530
Let's go and do that right now.

5
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:13,860
All right.

6
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:18,410
Let's take that off and let's comment this whole thing right here.

7
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:20,800
All right.

8
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:27,420
So right now the way this is if I send this like this I think we should get something from it.

9
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:32,550
Let us refresh and click on it as you can see.

10
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:36,230
We get all the records back with IDS and everything.

11
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:36,530
All right.

12
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,800
But we want to show a little bit more than that right.

13
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,740
Well a little bit something different right.

14
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:47,280
We don't want to show everything we want to show something specific to that record so let's do that

15
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:48,600
test right now.

16
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:55,650
First of all we want to test to see if the I.D. that's being said the post requests is equal to the

17
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:56,370
ID right.

18
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:04,280
So we're going to say post if we're getting post value or key

19
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:10,320
right here.

20
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:11,840
Right.

21
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:23,330
Then we execute everything else and we are going to be selecting from cars where we see OK where ID

22
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:28,410
equals the idea that we're getting from here.

23
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:36,990
You can use this whole thing or you can make it a variable is up to you so I can go ahead and do that.

24
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:42,000
Of course you might want to clean that up with a function.

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,620
Let me show you how to do that.

26
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:48,170
So whatever you get from here I think you should clean it up.

27
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:57,250
All right my ask you a real scape string will scape everything coming in.

28
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:00,410
From here even though

29
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,860
this is very secure.

30
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,360
Right because he's a post requests.

31
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:15,660
Nobody's looking is sending is not typing anything that's import or anything like that right now because

32
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:16,680
we just sending that in.

33
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:23,440
But in the future when somebody is typing something in a tetes make sure that you clean it up like this.

34
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,410
All right.

35
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:29,490
We'll just the first parameter with this would be the connection.

36
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,520
And the second would be what I was cleaning and then you can assign an ID to it.

37
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,490
I mean a variable Now this is clean.

38
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:46,550
And we can replace that with like this ID.

39
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:50,600
All right so now let's check that out real quick to see if it works.

40
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,780
We're running a lot of calls and we haven't tested it.

41
00:02:52,800 --> 00:03:00,070
Click on it and now he's bring that specific code for click onto yota when it comes perfit things being

42
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:00,870
cleaned.

43
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:03,250
That's beautiful isn't it.

44
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,050
All right.

45
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:08,840
But now that we've been in that specific record let's actually make this look a little better.

46
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,560
Right.

47
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:13,150
Well we don't one TVs we don't have a table or anything like that.

48
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:23,160
I don't think I need we don't need this anymore we don't need this and we don't even need the TVs anymore.

49
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:25,900
Let's just do input them and see how it looks.

50
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,080
Import would a class of actually already have a class.

51
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:35,130
I don't know maybe one control would make this look better for in-control

52
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:46,400
this out here.

53
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:48,560
Let's see.

54
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:52,710
This just making both input like this.

55
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:55,620
We're going to need a couple of inputs here.

56
00:03:55,830 --> 00:04:05,420
The first input that we need is a ttes sole input type ttes that Sec.

57
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,580
That's the first one that we need the second one that we need it would be.

58
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,100
But in

59
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:13,590
so that would be a

60
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,640
button here and the buttons have different classes.

61
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:31,140
So let's say for this button would be that of the bond so let's say between success which would make

62
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,160
it a green one.

63
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:40,550
This is bull strapper right guys and ladies and this one would be for deletion for the leading so Bun

64
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:44,230
B D danger would make a red.

65
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:49,400
Let's take the form out there let's see how this looks real quick.

66
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,200
All right.

67
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,690
Not much to it yet.

68
00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:01,860
Let's put something value or something there.

69
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:08,100
So as a matter of fact we can make these bones there instead of inputs but it's up to you.

70
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:15,950
I mean whatever works you know let's just say the value would be for this one would be update

71
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:21,680
actually.

72
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:29,220
That would be updated like this.

73
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:33,300
And the value with this one here would be

74
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:39,080
to see how that looks now.

75
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:44,630
Looking a lot better right.

76
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:55,510
All right so we made really good progress in this one here.

77
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:56,770
All right.

78
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:58,920
So thank you so much for watching in the next lecture.

79
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:03,370
We'll continue working with this functionality here and I'll see you then.

80
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:03,910
Take care.

81
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:04,450
Have fun.
