1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:03,060
All right welcome back my students.

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:10,080
So we are actually making a lot of improvement here since we are starting to write these cold and that's

3
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:11,510
going to be a great thing.

4
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:11,880
All right.

5
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:15,130
You're going to organize my call a little bit here.

6
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:17,650
Right.

7
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:24,770
All right so why is the next thing the next thing would be to actually create the while loop right to

8
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:27,190
make this fetch.

9
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:36,080
So let's actually use a variable here and use the function Maia's you lie fetch array.

10
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:37,740
That's best.

11
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,240
And that Querrey which is the query.

12
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,290
Let me just copy this.

13
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:43,660
Real quick.

14
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:49,310
I don't want to actually write it down make a mistake and then you know go crazy trying to find out

15
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:50,530
what's going on right.

16
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:53,560
So just because we have a table I'm going to relate in that to you.

17
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,720
We have a table down here right where we're going to be catching that data.

18
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,510
We do we need a TR And we need some on cells right.

19
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:07,190
So let's go back to the split cars.

20
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:13,090
And so the first thing that I want to do is echo a TR

21
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,300
we go.

22
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:21,380
The second thing would be to call a TV

23
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,470
with some information right.

24
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:34,590
So we could say and it's put in brackets actually we can use it this is the only way we can use arrays

25
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:35,950
here when we have double quotes.

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,500
Right.

27
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,530
That's why I like to use double quotes because you can use arrays.

28
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:43,240
So we want to pull out the ID.

29
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:48,240
So first thing you want to pull out of them is sure make sure that you put these single calls around

30
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:56,080
and then we close that the like does.

31
00:01:56,210 --> 00:02:06,620
And we can just copy this and provide the name of that car which I think is cars that's the way you

32
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,220
can bring it out of the database.

33
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:14,820
And then make sure that this is the same there.

34
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:24,120
We can actually get this from here close a TR Guidice beautiful and we save it.

35
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:31,470
All right so this is looking really nice and next thing to do is to try this cold and see if it works.

36
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:33,240
But anyway we're going to do that in the next lecture.

37
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,880
If we find a bug or anything we'll fix it.

38
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:38,100
You're welcome to try the cold if it works for you.

39
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,030
Great.

40
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,630
If he doesn't don't worry we'll get it working on that net lecture.

41
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:46,060
Thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next lecture.
