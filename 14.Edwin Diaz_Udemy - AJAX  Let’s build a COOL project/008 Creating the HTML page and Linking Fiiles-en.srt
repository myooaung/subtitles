00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:03,210
Hi my students Welcome back.

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:05,260
It's really a pleasure to have you here.

3
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:06,800
I hope your day is going good.

4
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,680
My day is going wonderful.

5
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:11,050
I can feel the keyboard in my fingers.

6
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:17,270
I can't even field the energy right now inside of me wanting to live and live in live.

7
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:17,920
All right.

8
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,720
I'm alive right so that's why math matters right.

9
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,710
Well in this case you are alive.

10
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:25,170
You're watching me so feel good.

11
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:25,690
All right.

12
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:26,690
It's a great day.

13
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:29,510
You're learning something really valuable here right.

14
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:34,070
So now on this lecture we will be creating an in that hd a male page.

15
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:38,930
We're going to be linking to Jake where we were going to be also link it to bootstrap and making sure

16
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:41,310
that everything works just right.

17
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:41,980
All right.

18
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:46,620
If you don't know up again I have a really good cause I bought it for beginners.

19
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:53,720
Well actually for developers and I also have a course in javascript window that's not it's not the same

20
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:58,270
same same thing about Jake where we will help you understand Jake we're a little better.

21
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,280
I might have a course in Jake where we laid on.

22
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:01,080
Not sure yet.

23
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:04,280
So you might want to check on my house by the time you're watching this.

24
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,210
All right.

25
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:08,380
If you don't know it that's fine if you don't know Jake where.

26
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:09,920
Just follow me and you should be fine.

27
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:10,810
All right.

28
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:15,680
This course is not about Jake where we so we won't go into details or body right.

29
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:16,400
No.

30
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,490
Those are major tools that every developer should have.

31
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:19,940
All right.

32
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:22,090
So just make sure that you have it.

33
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:25,600
So now let's go ahead and get a right click here.

34
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:30,460
And I am going to create a file called index that age the e-mail.

35
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:31,360
Right.

36
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:38,670
And then you are just going to create a simple markup for our HD L5 document.

37
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:43,370
And I am also using a plugin called Emma which helps me write things faster.

38
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:46,480
So E M M E T Emett.

39
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:48,330
And that's a plug for this editor here.

40
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:53,060
A lot of editors have that plug in so if you are develop it you can go ahead and look it up online and

41
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:54,330
find out how to use it.

42
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:55,210
You saw how I did it.

43
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:59,670
I just put a question exclamation and tap and bang.

44
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,180
All right.

45
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:03,580
I just like teaching your stuff every every minute I guess.

46
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:08,600
I like teaching you stuff so make sure you grab all of that information in your brain and write it down

47
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,560
to them for good.

48
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:14,090
So I'm going to go to the Jay Querrey download section there.

49
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:18,470
Go to actually let's link bootstrap first.

50
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:22,100
So let's link this first one.

51
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:26,440
Here's first link and that's it.

52
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:29,870
You can see that you are all here get Bushrod that come.

53
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:34,250
And the next one is this one Jake.

54
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,330
Let's just make sure that Jay Square is below this.

55
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:37,800
All right.

56
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,880
Perfect.

57
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:43,160
So now the next step is for us to check this out to see if it works right.

58
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:45,720
He's got to make sure that he works.

59
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:52,620
I'm going to save it with my keyboard control as will command s and let's Gricean Jake where we put

60
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:58,620
our script tax for javascript for Jake where he basically is a library for javascript just to make things

61
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:04,840
easier for us to write and he has a whole bunch of I think well you should probably know that already.

62
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:13,840
So let's just create a simple function here from Jake where we and just make sure there are this is

63
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:16,280
this whole thing is working right.

64
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,650
All right so the document out ready is going to help us do that.

65
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:27,780
And I'm just going to learn something in the stream and I'm going to say this is great.

66
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:31,380
All right perfect.

67
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:33,260
There we go refresh.

68
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:36,120
I saved my document and I get that this is great.

69
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,930
So that means Jake where he's actually working.

70
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,830
This is beautiful right.

71
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:44,110
We got it working out our first try.

72
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:46,390
So anyways if you got this done great.

73
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:49,030
If you didn't don't worry about it I'll wait for you.

74
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,460
Well actually I won't wait for you.

75
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:54,080
You could just pause the video and you know copy it yourself.

76
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:56,930
But anyway thank you so much for watching this lecture.

77
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:59,690
I hope it was enjoyable for you as it was for me.

78
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:00,890
Now CNN that's all right.

79
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:01,570
Take care.
