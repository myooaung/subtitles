00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:02.230

All right we'll come back and my students.



2

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.470

So in the last lecture we build a link and we're build a container for the box that we are going to



3

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:08.870

be showing.



4

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:15.870

And on this lecture here I want to start refactoring some of this stuff so instead of actually creating



5

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:23.160

another page for you know the update and the lead part of the crowd we are going to be processing that



6

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.340

information one page so that way you can see how he's done on just one page right.



7

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.620

So let's create another page here another file.



8

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:38.270

I'm going to call this process that BHP like dat.



9

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:39.770

Right.



10

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.960

And I'm going to include our database of course



11

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:52.840

that's included right here on top let's open our BHB tag first include included.



12

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:54.490

All right.



13

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:56.110

Beautiful.



14

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:58.380

Because I'm not writing any more mail here.



15

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:59.580

Actually you know what.



16

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.610

Let's just close it just in case.



17

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:09.750

I think we're going to be using some some scripts or something like that.



18

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:10.250

All right.



19

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.820

But anyway so we've got this page right here.



20

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.010

But they're going to be writing this called later on.



21

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:23.310

But let's go now to the end that's actually these play cards right here.



22

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.360

Now we are clicking on the link we are showing the container and that's that's cool right.



23

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:39.410

But now we need to pull some information out of there because we need to make the request to be right.



24

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:45.420

So what do we need to make that request because we are going to be getting some information pulling



25

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.260

some information out.



26

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.980

So we need to pull all that information out of there.



27

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.760

We're going to be doing something like this.



28

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.370

Let me show you.



29

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.570

A cartes that's not showing it



30

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:10.930

display cars.



31

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.250

This isn't like this one.



32

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.040

All right.



33

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.170

Basically all we are going to be doing their



34

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:25.830

but the only difference is that we are going to be needing the I.D. because we are going to be this



35

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.940

way not only the idea but we are also going to be needing that title because we're going to be putting



36

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.670

that in their input in that touching input.



37

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:33.000

All right.



38

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.490

So that's basically the only difference here.



39

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.890

So let's actually copy all this.



40

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:46.950

Right now you know we're looking at least half some data from there copy this.



41

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.720

Let's take it to a process here like that.



42

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:58.150

Now here well let's just leave this like this for now and then later on we'll modify it a little bit.



43

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.800

Right.



44

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.370

Let's go back to



45

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:04.270

this play cards.



46

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.100

Actually we are in the same page.



47

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.440

I keep forgetting that.



48

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.010

All right so.



49

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.390

So how do we pull the I.D. from this table here.



50

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:17.650

But we have the link here so we can target it right.



51

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.050

And we have the I.D. right here.



52

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.180

So when you click on it we need to pull the I.D. from this link here.



53

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:33.510

So let's actually create a natural view here called rail and that's put that the ID right in there.



54

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.150

How about that.



55

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.760

Right.



56

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:39.530

So let's see here.



57

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.970

And I'm just going to separate this like this that we got.



58

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.480

All right.



59

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.280

So we got the idea there what else do we need we need to have what



60

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.350

well we need a ref to make that request right.



61

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.350

Do we need a ref.



62

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:07.780

Actually no we do not need a ref right.



63

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:09.780

We just need the ID.



64

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:10.810

That's it.



65

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:11.460

All right.



66

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.490

Anyway if we need something else we'll get it later on.



67

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:26.790

All right so now let's create a variable here and let's just say I want to grab this.



68

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:38.260

He We're going to target that 80 TR for review and it's going to be the rail review value like the course



69

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:42.970

you can ALLERT that knowledge just to make sure that we are getting the right stuff.



70

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:44.190

All right.



71

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:48.610

This too.



72

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:49.110

All right.



73

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.350

Let's check it out real quick.



74

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:54.970

I don't like the pound symbol there so we're going to take care of that right now.



75

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:56.010

Click on it.



76

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.720

We get at 43 ID with click on the next one.



77

00:04:58.780 --> 00:04:59.500

44.



78

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:00.890

All right we're getting the I.D..



79

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:02.370

Perfect.



80

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:04.480

All right so I don't want I don't like the power symbol there.



81

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:10.390

Let's get rid of that let's go to a ref here and just right javascript



82

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:19.040

colon and void zero save it.



83

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.500

Come back here.



84

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:23.710

Take that power symbol out of there you click on it.



85

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:25.270

We don't have that problem anymore.



86

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:26.000

Beautiful.



87

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:31.220

Learn something new for those of you that don't know how to do that they know how to do that.



88

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:31.680

All right.



89

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.690

So let's make our requests.



90

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:38.780

Let's use the post because we are going to be making post requests which is a lot better than anything



91

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:39.200

else



92

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:42.470

and



93

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:47.120

we have a process that BHB page.



94

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:50.470

So let's send that request there.



95

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:51.850

All right.



96

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:52.180

All right.



97

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:53.500

First parameter there.



98

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:59.910

Now the data that's going there and that would be the ID and ID.



99

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:00.750

All right.



100

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:04.660

That's always going right now if we need something we'll add later on.



101

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:13.950

And now the third parameter would be function Let's bring that down real quick.



102

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:15.390

All right.



103

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:21.020

So really in reality what I want to do is actually learn something just to make sure that the data is



104

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:25.600

being you know what actually on alert.



105

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:26.690

Yes.



106

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:29.210

Let's look at the data coming back.



107

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:33.020

So let's put it that variable there.



108

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:39.470

And right now if we go across that BHB we have this or this but we don't want this want to test it out



109

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:39.950

first



110

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:46.830

let's just echo something.



111

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:49.110

Save it.



112

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:50.840

Let's come back here.



113

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:57.570

And we're getting that back from the server response.



114

00:06:57.570 --> 00:06:58.560

All right perfect.



115

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:00.740

So it is working.



116

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:01.500

Beautiful.



117

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:04.930

Let's go back and let's see what else we can do here.



118

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:05.690

All right.



119

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:10.750

So what we want to do is one insert the data in the action container right.



120

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:15.720

We're targeting.



121

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:24.030

And this is hold down right here and we'll just use the H to malfunction there and we'll put the data



122

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:25.320

in there.



123

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:26.390

All right.



124

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:34.610

Let's go back to process and let's bring that back and see if it works.



125

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:35.940

We already have a hello there.



126

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:38.020

So foolisher refresh



127

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:46.730

click on it and now is actually being replaced by the new hello coming from the database.



128

00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:49.390

All right I hope you see how this is working.



129

00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:51.620

Looking pretty cool right.



130

00:07:51.640 --> 00:08:00.540

But anyway remember that we want to bring the values only specific to each of this links right to each



131

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:03.200

of these records rows in the database.



132

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:06.820

So for the road I would add the number for 44 for Honda.



133

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:11.700

I want to bring that record there to update for the lead.



134

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:18.330

Whatever this Honda role in the database not just everything right.



135

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:23.210

But anyway in the next lecture we'll continue building on this thing if you want to go ahead and you



136

00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:25.460

know be creative and start doing something extra.



137

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:27.350

Go ahead and start doing it before me.



138

00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:28.610

See you in the next lecture.



139

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:29.100

Take your.
