00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:05.700

All right welcome back my students I hope you're really excited because we're learning something super



2

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:06.690

valuable here.



3

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:15.390

So let's go back to our cold here and I don't know if it's I actually show you a thing on the last lecture



4

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.980

we got this data here but I didn't type anything here I just wanted to type something here and show



5

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.110

you.



6

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:26.270

Murray says and you can see now that we are actually pulling all that information out of there.



7

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:27.180

All right.



8

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.020

So we just want you to know.



9

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:35.850

All right so what we're going to be using is this function call that post.



10

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.020

All right.



11

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.800

So this function is going to be in charge of sending all this information to where it needs to go.



12

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:44.410

All right.



13

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:50.080

So let's go ahead and create does this say pose.



14

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.150

First thing that we need to send is the you are now.



15

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.580

And what else do we need to send in.



16

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:04.410

This post is just going to say like it's going to be like this.



17

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:07.330

So we're going to pass in this parameter.



18

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.030

If you are the next one is post data



19

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:24.230

and the next one will be a function actually let me just pull this over here.



20

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.600

All right let's do it like this because this is the way I'm used to it.



21

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:29.260

All right.



22

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.760

So we're Pessin this guy right here.



23

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.360

I'm just trying to remember because I haven't used this in a while.



24

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.420

False data.



25

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.310

And then here the third parameter then with passing a function OK.



26

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:50.500

Now I remember are-I almost lost it for a minute then we pass in the data we're get him back which is



27

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.780

going to be card data.



28

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:53.300

All right.



29

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:54.770

Or we can say



30

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.330

HP stable data.



31

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.210

All right so that way you know exactly what it is.



32

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.660

All right.



33

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.250

So we can put this data somewhere.



34

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.280

All right.



35

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:17.210

Do we have a search box somewhere here that we are using actually down here where we are putting some



36

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:18.020

information



37

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.430

search bots



38

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.110

these resorts right here.



39

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:40.600

All right so they actually put this somewhere else.



40

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.010

Dave roll right here this is this form.



41

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.810

This is that roll.



42

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:52.950

There it will be nice if we can put this data somewhere else so you're going to make it there fear with



43

00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:10.590

a class of fat ass sets and say you we're going to put a diff with car with salt.



44

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:16.560

Actually that's just car salt.



45

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:17.910

There we go.



46

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.340

All right and that's what we're going to be putting all this information in there.



47

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:22.210

All right.



48

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:33.340

So we gonna target ID and then we're going to be putting in mail and then we put this



49

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.280

post-dating there.



50

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.020

All right.



51

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.240

But before we do that let's just come in this hour real quick.



52

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.640

All right we're going to send that data and then if we want to get back something.



53

00:03:52.790 --> 00:04:00.280

But for now let's go into the cars and set this up real quick I think we're running out of time here.



54

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:03.080

But basically what we want to do is want to catch the



55

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:10.460

catch the pull superglue over here.



56

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:19.100

So we're going to say if foe's this post data comes here and this pulls data is going to be needed to



57

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:32.350

to to to to to to to to just go back here and see what their name is and it's all right once we send



58

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.620

it in.



59

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.610

Actually it's going to have the same names not going to be like this one where we're sending it right



60

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:43.800

here we're sending the information that search with here we send information as it is and form.



61

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:51.070

So this one here the form is going to have a current name and that's how we're going to receive we receive



62

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:52.270

it at the end.



63

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:58.330

In the cards that BHP So if that's there then we execute it.



64

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:04.120

So I'm just going to say echo something like data received.



65

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.180

So that way we know we are communicating right.



66

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:09.370

Come back to in



67

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.630

and let's just echo that data right here.



68

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.580

Hopes are still executing stuff out.



69

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:29.320

All right this is going somewhere else where it's not supposed to be going



70

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:39.850

it's going to cars out BHP is executing so we need to go back and make sure that it doesn't execute



71

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:50.700

serialise



72

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.140

we will click on it.



73

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:03.560

And he's executing right now.



74

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:09.600

But on the next lecture we're going to debug this and make sure that he doesn't send this information



75

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:14.610

anywhere that he's not supposed to right now is sending these parameters and this is not supposed to



76

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:19.170

be happening so we wrote a lot of code on this one here and I'm going to cut this lecture we can spend



77

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:21.050

a couple of minutes the bug in this.



78

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:26.590

But what I want to do is I want to come back and actually fix this fast for you.



79

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:27.170

All right.



80

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:33.510

So the jump to the next lecture in this should be fits and we should be actually transferring some information



81

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:36.650

to our database communicating with BHB.



82

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:37.800

See you in the next lecture.
