1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:06,680
All right welcome back my students so if you went ahead and try this cold and the last section of a

2
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:10,300
cold you've probably got to work.

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:14,110
Let's find out real quick let's just click Update.

4
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:15,390
Oh we got this.

5
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:16,390
We got to work on that.

6
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:20,370
And now you see that the record is being updated from the database.

7
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:22,140
Isn't that beautiful right.

8
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:23,520
So it works really good.

9
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,040
We're getting that.

10
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:34,050
Let's see if we can at least get something back a little nicer on alert alerting everything.

11
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:35,490
Let's just say something like

12
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:48,000
your data of data and successfully.

13
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:49,240
All right.

14
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,710
You can also insert

15
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:57,480
Let's see.

16
00:00:57,730 --> 00:00:58,960
Let's actually refresh this

17
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:06,800
right.

18
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:10,880
We can actually write more advanced Querrey see if we wanted to if nothing was changed.

19
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:12,460
We can also alert that now.

20
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:17,590
But that would probably be really events parts of this placation.

21
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,410
If I decide to make more lectures.

22
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:25,530
My main goal here is to show you the crowd create read and delete this actually create something a little

23
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:29,280
better than an alert.

24
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:29,910
Right.

25
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,800
Let's go to bootstrap real quick.

26
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:35,210
All right.

27
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:44,190
And bootstrap P As a matter of fact I already know how to do this.

28
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:48,130
I don't have to have bootstraps So you just do it real quick.

29
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:54,580
What I want to do is insert something in a div somewhere.

30
00:01:54,580 --> 00:02:00,850
So let's go to end its real quick and let's find out where can we insert this type of notification that

31
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:03,790
it was already updated.

32
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:05,400
Instead of being alert.

33
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:05,850
Right.

34
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:07,270
What about here.

35
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:08,110
Right up off here.

36
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:08,710
Can we do that.

37
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:18,750
Yeah we can actually look for that code in the process that BHB because that's dynamic code.

38
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,110
All right.

39
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,540
So we are displaying or inputs right here we've got these tetch input right.

40
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:35,950
If we could if we wanted to display it we can use BHB to do that but I think that's too much colder

41
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:36,630
ready.

42
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:46,940
Let's go to end that's and ry above here we can say we can read a little paragraph with an ID

43
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:53,380
and also it a class of

44
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:59,350
e.g. success.

45
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:00,220
There we go.

46
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:02,010
Right.

47
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:05,870
So we're going to target this and put some information there.

48
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,350
All right.

49
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:15,630
US is that BHP all the way to the bottom here.

50
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:18,920
Just answer some stuff right.

51
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:26,050
Use this idea and let's just answer some HDMI in there.

52
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,280
All right.

53
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:34,030
And whether we want insert We could write some tests.

54
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:36,360
Well I think tets would work fine for us.

55
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:37,880
Let's just say.

56
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:46,910
Of data successfully Let's see how this works.

57
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:49,500
All right.

58
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:50,310
All right.

59
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:51,190
Perfect.

60
00:03:54,820 --> 00:04:00,690
Ray as you can see says Recker of data successfully.

61
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:01,270
All right.

62
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:09,270
And you can also get another container in Bootstrap where you can take this off if you like it will

63
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:10,510
go off every time there.

64
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:10,790
But

65
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:19,270
that's just to give you an idea how this is done that you can get really advance on this if you like.

66
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:23,880
But anyway I'll leave it like this and maybe later on we'll create something a little more fancy.

67
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:28,450
I just wanted to show you this could be done with the data coming back from the database.

68
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:29,670
All right.

69
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:30,800
All right.

70
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:34,590
With the response coming back from the database it was a pleasure as always.

71
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,890
I'll see you in the next lecture.
