1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,020
All right welcome back my dear student.

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:09,750
So one thing that I want to actually do in this small application here is that I want to go to search

3
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:14,370
and I want to take this out of here I want to take the connection out and then I'm going to cut it out.

4
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:19,490
All right and I want to create a separate file for our connection to our database is going to cold is

5
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:22,670
going to be called divi BHP.

6
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:23,520
All right.

7
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,010
And I'm going to paste that in there.

8
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:27,610
Whoops.

9
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,030
What did I do with it I do.

10
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:33,910
It's not good.

11
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:35,850
The BHB enter

12
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:42,950
Roy and then pasted in there.

13
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,490
Sorry about that guys.

14
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:51,260
Make sure that you pull your BHB tags of course and I wish the editor had that BHB tags.

15
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:57,660
Hopefully by the time you're watching this it does have some type of plug in that we can you know do

16
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:02,390
that fee and then tap and we create a BHB tag automatically that would be nice.

17
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:06,610
I haven't really I should actually researched it but probably is already available.

18
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,480
But anyway so we have the connection here.

19
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:15,480
What we need right now is to include this in our search just to make sure that

20
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:21,470
it's working.

21
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:22,870
That would be nice.

22
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:27,470
I think you could do require that to include and see how that works.

23
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,480
And we own the B.

24
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:30,980
B.

25
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,310
B.

26
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:32,780
All right.

27
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:36,320
And let's try this out to see if it works.

28
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,440
Be all right.

29
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:39,940
So he's still working.

30
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:40,880
Beautiful.

31
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,470
So we're going to do the same thing for sure.

32
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:47,840
We haven't created it yet.

33
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:54,410
All right we're going to be creating a different file for our code to add the cars.

34
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:55,260
All right.

35
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,210
We could if we wanted to put it right here if we it but we're not going to do that.

36
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:01,310
We're going to send this information somewhere else.

37
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:12,100
So I'm going to create a separate file and I'm going to call this at the car that BHP Antar and we're

38
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:13,690
going to include.

39
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:16,030
That's right ph feedback for first right.

40
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:19,740
We do

41
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:31,460
we include the database of course the be that BHB.

42
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:32,540
All right.

43
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,730
So we have this file ready here to go.

44
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:39,230
Let's go to our end there and see what we gotta do here.

45
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:46,310
So basically what we're going to be doing here is picking up all this information with Jake wari and

46
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:52,940
communicate it like we did here but we're going to be using some different functions to communicate

47
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:55,610
because I just want to show you a different way of doing it.

48
00:02:55,610 --> 00:03:01,070
You're right you learn that Ageod's function and that's when you're going to learn that that post function

49
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,840
is going to be really cool.

50
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,300
All right.

51
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:11,920
So let's actually make sure that we have the correct.

52
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:12,450
All right.

53
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:15,310
So we're going to start writing a call right here.

54
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:21,250
All right but let's go to a form to the forum first and put an ID here because one is selected and we're

55
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:26,440
going to say at car form that's going to be the idea right.

56
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:31,060
So in the next lecture we're going to select the form get all the data out of there and submit it to

57
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:31,570
the database.

58
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:33,150
Hopefully we got time to do that.

59
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:34,200
The next one.

60
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:37,770
Take care keep active keep playing around with the cold.

61
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:42,710
It's really exciting to learn something new and I promise you this course is going to give you some

62
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:48,560
some of the foundations that you're going to be using in really really nice application with agents.

63
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:50,350
Thank you and I'll see you in the next lecture.
