1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,070
All right welcome back my dear student.

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:08,720
So we need to write some functionalities here so that way when we click on here we send Ageod's requests.

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:09,020
All right.

4
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:10,880
And get something back from the server right.

5
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:12,260
Make everything work.

6
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:18,680
So we need to target is born here and when we when we talk when we click on it we want to send the data.

7
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:22,500
We want to send is value we want to send the ID and everything through agents.

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,800
So let's target our buy in there and make sure that we add some type of functionality when we click

9
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,520
it.

10
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:32,440
So let's say let's first give up on an ID.

11
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,230
So this one here of the

12
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:38,600
has a car Id here.

13
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:42,300
Let's just say update right here.

14
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:46,630
And let's while we at it let's just change this one to the list.

15
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:50,210
There we go.

16
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:53,060
So what are we going to do.

17
00:00:54,150 --> 00:01:02,580
Let's actually is class and we're going to say when we click on it I'm going to use on function

18
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:07,960
run dysfunction

19
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:16,660
make sure you put your pull my ear.

20
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:21,030
All right let's test it out real quick just to make sure that it works.

21
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:24,050
What an industry in there real quick.

22
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,760
All right refresh

23
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:32,160
and click on it.

24
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:35,950
It's not working.

25
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:36,840
All right.

26
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:38,390
Let's check it out.

27
00:01:52,370 --> 00:02:00,520
And that's just because it is inside the other functionality there and that needs to be separate.

28
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:04,300
So I'm going to put this right here.

29
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,750
There we go.

30
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:20,520
Bigot.

31
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,570
And now it works.

32
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:25,680
And he takes over stuff there.

33
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:26,140
All right.

34
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:26,700
Perfect.

35
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:41,090
All right so I'm just going to actually write some variables here.

36
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:48,580
Update delete stuff I don't want to use that.

37
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,420
That's just say delete this all right.

38
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:55,270
They did delete this.

39
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:59,400
I know this is weird but let's do that.

40
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,000
All right.

41
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:09,720
And as a matter of fact I'm going to just put something here.

42
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:20,770
Update science on something right away way to and we're going to use this just to detect the pulse requests.

43
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:23,300
That's all right.

44
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:29,450
So let's use post that falls right here.

45
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:45,730
And the first of course parameter would be the process that BHB then the data that's going in and taking

46
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:50,580
in the title we're getting right here.

47
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:52,950
So let's write that right there.

48
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:57,450
Title.

49
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:08,480
And we're also taking in the idea as well that this should be first lady.

50
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:09,600
What else.

51
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,820
And maybe this update by now.

52
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,120
I think we should take that.

53
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,020
UPDATE this.

54
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:18,970
There we go.

55
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:19,820
And then the function

56
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:29,970
right looking pretty good.

57
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:40,630
Let's look at the data coming back.

58
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:48,310
Let's go to process values.

59
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:55,060
We are here ready.

60
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,630
You should put a comment on this one here.

61
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,110
Just saying.

62
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,540
Just playing

63
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:07,930
choose me.

64
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:15,950
And you can bring them down here

65
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:25,640
and here you would write something like updating or something like that.

66
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,440
Perfect.

67
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:39,330
So now we can write functions if set and then post

68
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:47,740
update does that said then we will do something right.

69
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:54,190
So what can we do.

70
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:57,090
Well we can just Eckl it works

71
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,650
and it's called here.

72
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,280
All right beautiful.

73
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:06,860
Save it.

74
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:19,400
I click on it and it works and then we have pulling out all that information.

75
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:19,990
All right.

76
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:25,420
All right.

77
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,400
Actually pulling out all the data.

78
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:29,930
We don't want to see all that data right.

79
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:33,770
But anyway thank you so much for watching.

80
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,580
This is working if it's not working for you.

81
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:37,380
Make sure you watch the video again.

82
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:44,330
Any little cool My here or the cold or single call that you're missing can make your whole thing fail.

83
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:47,150
So you know check your inspect Elliman.

84
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:47,950
All right.

85
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,840
Anyway thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next lecture.
