00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:05.780

All right welcome back my students I hope you're having fun with this little complication here and the



2

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:07.130

course so far.



3

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.090

But anyway we have come very far.



4

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:16.620

Right now we are actually you know making this action container here you know putting the buns there



5

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:23.640

right now we're what would I like to see here is a value coming from the database to each of this specific



6

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.560

value from each of these roles here.



7

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:26.360

Right.



8

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:28.590

So let's do that right now let's bring a value there.



9

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:36.840

Let's go back to a process that BHP and on the ttes here has put a value here and the value would be



10

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.970

the title right.



11

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:51.260

So will say we won the title here.



12

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:51.690

All right.



13

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:58.760

So that would be the value of the Chicot.



14

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.740

And as you can see now we had different values there.



15

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.220

Beautiful.



16

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:04.070

All right.



17

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:11.650

So now the next thing that we need is to be able to send a request to the server to update these values.



18

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:18.760

Take this to the server and tell the server listen I want you to update this right with this new value



19

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.080

that I'm putting in this box here.



20

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.560

So how do we do that.



21

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.980

Well first we need to grab the value right.



22

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.200

And then we need to grab the ID of it as well.



23

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:35.710

So that way we can send those bill for that information to the server right to to process it.



24

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:36.340

All right.



25

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:36.920

So



26

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:43.300

let's start writing our Jake wari.



27

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.290

All right.



28

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:46.760

All right.



29

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.610

Perfect.



30

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:54.780

And remember what I told you about anomic tetes I mean dynamic data is that we need to have the same



31

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.740

functionality on the same page that we are creating on the namak data.



32

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:59.270

Right.



33

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:12.840

So let's use this script here.



34

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:21.550

You know what we need something like this here just to make sure we need it in that display cards.



35

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.290

All right make sure that you have that there.



36

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.790

It's very important to have that there.



37

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:29.860

Save it.



38

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.080

Let's take that to the process that each page.



39

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.610

Just before we write any Jake where are we here.



40

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:37.740

All right.



41

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.410

Take that there as well.



42

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.020

And then we'll have this here and there.



43

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.370

Bring that down like this.



44

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:51.500

All right.



45

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:53.530

All right.



46

00:02:53.530 --> 00:03:01.320

So let's fry some global variables here just in case we need the I.D. and we need that title right.



47

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.520

Perfect.



48

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.970

Now we can write some comments here and say you know what.



49

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:07.930

Extract



50

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.680

ID untied or something like that.



51

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.030

All right.



52

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.430

Now how can we extract it from here.



53

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.160

How do we calm this guy right here.



54

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.510

Well we're not going to be putting a lot of this right now.



55

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:31.420

Not many touch which is one so we can use an ID.



56

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.110

All right.



57

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:34.530

We can use this car.



58

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:35.650

I t.



59

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.290

We can use that class to get the value out.



60

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:47.380

All right let's check it out.



61

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.880

Actually



62

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:52.830

let's just make it more meaningful.



63

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.480

How about that would make something something a little.



64

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:02.300

More meaningful than this.



65

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:03.300

Where are we going to get.



66

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.220

Let me just go back here.



67

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.830

Right now we can get the idea from here.



68

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:09.240

We need the ID's somehow right.



69

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:15.030

Because we can get a value that's ok we can get it from this from this input but we also need the ideas



70

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.200

that we need to get the idea from



71

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:21.330

right.



72

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:26.320

All right.



73

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:34.720

So what we're going to be doing is when we click on this tets input here you're going to be a garroting



74

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:41.320

to value two things we're going to be grabbing the idea in the title right.



75

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.700

So first of all let's actually put that somewhere.



76

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:53.730

So we got it tied on the value and I mean the title there and then we can make Rayle not your view and



77

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.040

put the idea in there.



78

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.670

All right.



79

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:58.100

So that way we can pull it out.



80

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:03.060

To the tune right here.



81

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:08.190

Copy right here and make sure that we change it for the ID.



82

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:08.830

All right.



83

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:09.640

And that's how we're going to do



84

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:14.800

perfect.



85

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:16.520

Let's go down.



86

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:17.960

That's right.



87

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:18.990

Jake where are we now.



88

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:21.920

Let's see if we can get it by



89

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:38.070

know what we should actually put a different name on this something like title tets or title input that's



90

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.460

more meaningful.



91

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:43.840

Can use a class or you can use an idea I just don't want to put more stuffing here.



92

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:44.830

All right.



93

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:55.630

So from the title input I want to when we actually want to use our own function and when



94

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:08.120

we put our select that right on that input we're run dysfunction.



95

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:09.730

All right.



96

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:15.230

So I'm going to grab two values when I click on this text input two values a title and ID.



97

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:18.580

Beautiful I think is better like that we can do in different ways.



98

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:25.490

But I think it's better now let's use Jake wari here to extract that.



99

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:39.200

Let's use you know what this like this an 80 or let's get the first from the.



100

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:43.390

And the second one is going to be the title.



101

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:48.800

And this also used this Hoopes.



102

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:58.660

And we'll just get it out like this you know and just to test this out we can just say Alert alert title



103

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:02.350

or title and see how that works save it.



104

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:03.570

Come back here.



105

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:08.260

Refresh and just click on it.



106

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:12.500

Folks there we go.



107

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:12.820

So



108

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:20.030

all right you need to tie down to get those values out.



109

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:25.620

I think this is a lot better than we can use other functionality we can use on click blur.



110

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:29.690

I mean there's a whole bunch of things that we can use but I found that this is the best one to use



111

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:30.340

with input.



112

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:36.550

The input one arises when you type you get all those values out immediately.



113

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:37.890

Beautiful.



114

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:39.160

So we got that there.



115

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:45.640

Let's actually put another common he is going to get you used to writing comments



116

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:50.650

of date.



117

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:55.460

And I think this would be the last one that I do with you.



118

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:56.540

All right.



119

00:07:58.830 --> 00:07:59.630

Perfect.



120

00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:06.830

So now down here what we going to be doing is writing the functionality for the Ajax.



121

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:07.470

All right.



122

00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:10.720

So anyway thank you so much on the next lecture we'll target that.



123

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:12.510

And it's been a pleasure.



124

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:13.370

Take care.
