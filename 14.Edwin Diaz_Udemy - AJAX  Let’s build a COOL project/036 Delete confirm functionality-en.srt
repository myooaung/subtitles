1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,030
All right welcome back my students.

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:07,110
So I decided to come back because I wanted to work on this notification that we were getting here.

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,400
All right I want to close it.

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,560
We get this little bug here.

5
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:15,990
And I also wanted to work on THE LEAD functionality right now which is alerting saying something like

6
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:17,080
delete whatever.

7
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,330
And we still have this problem here.

8
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:22,530
Now we can hide it every time we took one of those.

9
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:27,220
But I think it would be nice if we had this close automatically with the bots.

10
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:40,700
So all we have to do for that is go to and that's take it out from there or put it right here.

11
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:49,090
Actually we go to Prosser's up the HP and we can include it right here on top this for sure where we'll

12
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:53,750
work as we go.

13
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:54,790
Now we save.

14
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:03,520
And when we come back if we have some this we still get this but when we close it does disappear so

15
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,630
that's taken care of.

16
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:11,480
Right now let's work with the delete to what can we do with the functionality Well what I had in mind

17
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:15,860
was a confirmed bond saying something like Are you sure you want to delete this item.

18
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:17,010
Something like that anyway.

19
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:20,750
We are not sure we can solve it and then everything will be cancell.

20
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:26,450
If we are sure we can continue deleting it because sometimes we might just click on that and there not

21
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:28,710
be sure that we want to delete that data.

22
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:37,500
So right here what I want to do is when we click on this button there I want to add to q an if statement.

23
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:45,280
Now I want to say if because this function will return true if something was if it went through or not

24
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:48,080
right if it's cancel is false the fees.

25
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:51,240
OK then is true.

26
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,710
So confirm from javascript.

27
00:01:54,790 --> 00:02:02,340
Are you sure you want to delete this.

28
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:03,980
So we wrap it around here

29
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:16,340
here and just put a semi-colon there for some reason that's not that did not have it there.

30
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:17,280
All right.

31
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,680
Let's save it and let's find out if it works.

32
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,440
All right.

33
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:26,080
So click to what I would try to delete it and says Are you sure you want to delete it.

34
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,580
No cancel.

35
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:28,500
Nothing was deleted.

36
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:32,350
Beautiful right in simple this actually click it again.

37
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:36,870
And you know what I want to delete it delete it.

38
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:39,700
But I want to take it out of there right here.

39
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,410
We don't need that anymore.

40
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:45,040
All right that was fun let's test it again.

41
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:48,430
Let's add something to the database and w.

42
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:51,310
Let's try to delete this item right now.

43
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:52,180
Delete.

44
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:53,730
Are you sure you want to lead counsel.

45
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:54,700
I don't want to delete it.

46
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,950
I'm going to try this guy right here.

47
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:58,310
Are you sure you want to delete this.

48
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,330
Yes I am.

49
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:02,040
Item deleted.

50
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,190
Beautiful.

51
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:04,060
All right.

52
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:06,540
Very simple I think you learn something new here.

53
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:12,100
