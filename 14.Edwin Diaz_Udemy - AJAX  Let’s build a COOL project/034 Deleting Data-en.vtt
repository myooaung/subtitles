00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.270

All right we'll come back with your students I hope you're having fun.



2

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:04.170

This is really good.



3

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.320

We're learning something that will make applications super cool.



4

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:12.570

But anyway on this lecture we're going to start working on the delete functionality and we already did



5

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:13.560

something with the update.



6

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.030

So this is going to be a breeze right because of the leaf function.



7

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:18.680

It's super simple to do.



8

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.970

So let's go ahead and start working on that.



9

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:22.260

All right.



10

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.900

So the only thing that we need to delete from BHB of course is the idea of the record right.



11

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:28.360

So we already have a function.



12

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:34.590

I mean processes that BHB here we already have a function ID for that update let's actually copy these



13

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.170

down right.



14

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.290

Copy this comment because is useful to have it



15

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:53.160

right here and say delete and and a copy of this face to right here and you know a little comment for



16

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:03.490

the document ready would be nice document ready and tacks right there.



17

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:09.360

Right so we're going to target that elite class which we already have a peer



18

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.410

right this button right here we have a daily class there right.



19

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.140

Just make sure that you know that.



20

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.820

All right.



21

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.390

So once we tell you that then we want something to happen.



22

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.790

We're going to take in the idea



23

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.010

don't have a yet because



24

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.090

we need waterfalls to get the ID we need to click on this.



25

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:44.610

The way we did that functionality before is that when we click on it then we extract the ID but we delete



26

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.690

We don't have the ID available right.



27

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:55.970

So the ID would be available in here and this links so we got extracted from there.



28

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:56.810

All right.



29

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:10.050

So right now when we opened up bots Let's go to these cars and look at it.



30

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:16.630

So we got the ID already in this link right here so we need to extract it from this rail.



31

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.720

All right wouldn't the title link actually let's go back and do it in kinda dissenting



32

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:36.390

but let's grab this.



33

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.840

We are extracted from that title link



34

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:42.050

title



35

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.580

title link.



36

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:47.390

There we go.



37

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:51.910

Then we don't need to send the title there.



38

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.610

We don't need to send.



39

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:02.330

We need to send delete this bill so we write one.



40

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.390

We just copy and paste here.



41

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:06.770

All right.



42

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.940

And let's actually make sure that we're getting something back from the server.



43

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:18.050

Let's just alert ID.



44

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:23.460

All right this looks like it could work.



45

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:28.240

Let's go in-process that BHP and create the wall up here.



46

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.430

So we got this update this.



47

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:36.820

Let's do the next BHB function already deleting data.



48

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.490

Just copy this whole thing.



49

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:47.260

We don't have to but



50

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:55.590

write We don't need that title



51

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.890

and we're going to change equerry we're going to say delete



52

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:15.580

delete from cars where IDs Id like to



53

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:22.640

fix them misspelled there.



54

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.150

And I think we're golden here.



55

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:27.120

All right.



56

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:33.580

And that's actually



57

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:41.440

right.



58

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:42.220

Find out



59

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.080

nothing is deleted.



60

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:57.400

The data is going sigh.



61

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:01.400

It's going to be up here.



62

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:05.740

But now deleting so delete



63

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:17.120

from cars where ID equals ID.



64

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:18.650

We've got to see where we did wrong.



65

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:21.160

And you probably seen mine already and you figured that out.



66

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:24.700

But from car where Id calls ID



67

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:35.820

we're sending that into Ajax



68

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:44.650

right here found symbol.



69

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:51.210

Make sure you have that hash right here for the ID list does it actually have class.



70

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:56.960

Be careful on that.



71

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:00.580

Save this going.



72

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:01.880

Try that out now.



73

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:09.160

Refresh click on here and delete Hugo is deleted.



74

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:11.970

When I we need to remove this from here.



75

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:13.860

So let's work on that.



76

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:19.270

And right after we alert that we need to remove.



77

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:25.860

So I believe that it's call the action container



78

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:46.260

container and then hide it see if we got it save it come back here Honda deleted.



79

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:47.120

All right.



80

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:53.140

So now we got the daily functionality is working beautifully and let's try another one.



81

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:54.730

Beautiful lead it



82

00:06:58.330 --> 00:06:59.030

or.



83

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:00.280

Well that's OK.



84

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:07.960

You can you can switch this around if you want it actually hide it before you you are alert somebody.



85

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:08.980

It's up to you.



86

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:13.720

Or if you want to confirm it we can also show the later to confirm if they wanted to delete it.



87

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:14.330

All right.



88

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:15.860

I'll show I can show you how to do that.



89

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:22.420

And make sure lectures but on the next lecture we'll build a little bun here that will close the spots



90

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:24.390

just in case we don't want to do anything with it.



91

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:25.240

All right.



92

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:31.340

So if you want to go ahead and do that right now you can go go ahead and feel free to do it.



93

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:35.240

Thank you so much for watching and for the support you guys gave me all the time.



94

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:36.410

I really appreciate it.



95

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:42.520

That's the reason why I'm making these lectures because people like you and you see you in the next



96

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:42.910

lecture.
