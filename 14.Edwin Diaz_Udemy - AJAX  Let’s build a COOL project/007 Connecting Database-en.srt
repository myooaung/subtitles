1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,350
I'm a wonderful students today I'm going to show you will.

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:08,460
You should already know but we will be making our connection with our database.

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:09,090
Right.

4
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:11,250
So let's go ahead and do that.

5
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:15,750
I'm going to open my coeditor one of them.

6
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:19,110
I use brackets and this is a free coeditor by the way.

7
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:20,050
Get off their phone.

8
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,640
B corps which I will be removing in a minute.

9
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,980
So I'm going to make a folder here called age that's all right.

10
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:30,810
Whoops.

11
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:32,820
I'm already doing something in my coeditor.

12
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,010
Sorry about that.

13
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:41,580
Let's just make something for the code that's on my desktop and I'm just going to make sure age is already

14
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:43,410
taken.

15
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:44,030
All right.

16
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:48,540
So that's Demel.

17
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:49,010
All right.

18
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:50,920
A judge underscored Demel.

19
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,880
It looks like I have another folder on my desktop.

20
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,130
All right.

21
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:57,190
So Ajax Demel perfect.

22
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,990
So here I'm going to connect.

23
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:04,190
I'm going to create a couple of files let's just create the first file and then we will do with the

24
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:04,470
rest.

25
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:05,050
All right.

26
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:09,070
So I'm just going to reichlich it right click anywhere here.

27
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:16,000
Again this coeditor is free and advertising them.

28
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,940
It has been pretty good for me.

29
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:18,350
All right.

30
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,670
It's a really good way to mail.

31
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:28,310
So let's create the first one is going to be called Search Dopp HP.

32
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:32,660
And the reason why we created this first is because I want to make sure that we have a connection where

33
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:35,590
our database are really super important right.

34
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:39,290
So I'm going to open some ph BTX here.

35
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:46,120
All right.

36
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,840
And let's create our connections here.

37
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,410
Like I said before you should already know how to do this.

38
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:52,120
If you don't.

39
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:56,450
And I said very clearly before lecture.

40
00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:04,050
All right because this is a little advance if you don't know it.

41
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:04,590
All right.

42
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:14,130
So let's create a connection here where a local host parameter there make sure we are creating this

43
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:21,070
list doesn't let me majus does a little bit bigger here so you can see and just going up there.

44
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:21,600
All right.

45
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,300
Perfect.

46
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:23,780
OK

47
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:30,780
and our database name.

48
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,240
That's I believe.

49
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:34,110
All right.

50
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,480
So that's that's you.

51
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:41,200
Let's go ahead and test our connection actually make sure that it is working right.

52
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:51,030
So let's just say yes it is perfect.

53
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,780
All right so I hope you have an awesome day.

54
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:56,030
I'm having a really good day today again.

55
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:59,190
Able to be alive and breathing right.

56
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:04,560
I was just sick one or two weeks ago and I thought I was going to die basically.

57
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:07,190
But thank God that everything is fine.

58
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:07,740
All right.

59
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:12,490
So now we do need to actually places folder in our

60
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,830
zap location right.

61
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:26,490
Just make sure that you place there I think I have the docs folder in my somewhere and my desktop looks

62
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:28,320
like I don't but that's fine.

63
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:36,310
I'm just going to go to my Xantippe HD Ducs make sure that you place it in your local server.

64
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:37,250
There we go.

65
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,540
Now we have that working there.

66
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:49,320
Now I'm going to go back to my coeditor and this button here allows me to preview this in the browser.

67
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:53,880
So I'm just going to define loco's here actually.

68
00:03:54,200 --> 00:04:06,070
HTP localhost and the folder that we made for this one is Ageod's underscored them all right.

69
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:09,640
He juts underscored them all that we are.

70
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:12,070
Let's see if this works.

71
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:14,770
All right let's check it out.

72
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:16,360
Perfect.

73
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:16,730
All right.

74
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:21,200
So what I like about this coin is that I can preview my documents when I take them here.

75
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:23,520
I can just preview right away on the browser.

76
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:23,950
All right.

77
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:26,450
Even though it's BHB.

78
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:28,120
All right so we create a connection.

79
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:31,590
It looks like he's working perfect on the last lecture.

80
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:36,460
We're going to be creating that mark up and following with a tutorial right.

81
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:42,730
Perfit thank you so much for allowing me to teach you the scores and this classes and I'll see you in

82
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:43,590
the next one right.

83
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,170
Take care.

84
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:45,200
Have an awesome day.
