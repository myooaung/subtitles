00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:05.020

Welcome back my students I hope you're having fun with this course.



2

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:11.310

I'm having a really really hell of a fun time with you guys says you know you give me the opportunity



3

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:17.190

to teach you this and when and when I say you guys I mean ladies too I know ladies are also taking the



4

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:17.750

course.



5

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:18.370

All right.



6

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.680

So bless you ladies are wonderful sense.



7

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.450

They're more wonderful when they are in technology right.



8

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:26.550

Since they.



9

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.760

I mean to see a lady in technology is really awesome.



10

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:30.610

I like it.



11

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.820

So let's go ahead and write our next function here.



12

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.850

When it's not working right any function actually we did write some predefined functions here but it's



13

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.630

actually a piece of code right.



14

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:44.830

With some functions inside.



15

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.040

That's all we're going to be doing.



16

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.380

So let's get creative.



17

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.250

Wow real quick.



18

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:54.960

So in the last one we just created this statement here making sure that search was not empty making



19

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:02.640

sure the query was not what it was successful with selecting everything from the database as related



20

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.250

to this search starting with the first word.



21

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:12.300

All right so now here let's put everything from our database and actually not everything just feel that



22

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.230

we need just a column that we need right.



23

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.800

So let's use this while loop here.



24

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:22.380

And again if you don't know is if it looks confusing you should not look confusing because you should



25

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.490

know BHB and ask you well but if it looks confusing.



26

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.330

Make sure you check all my BHB course BHB for beginners.



27

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:42.360

So BHB array we are going to send this free set right here.



28

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:49.510

All right so now that we have that when we get it back here some way grow.



29

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.390

Let's just name it rule everybody does name and roll right.



30

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.430

Well it's it makes sense right zero.



31

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:05.250

And what we want to get out of that is from the column cars and not also named cars here.



32

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.850

I think that's a good name for it.



33

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:12.170

Cars or maybe we should call it brand actually.



34

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.770

Why not.



35

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:13.640

Brand.



36

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.720

There we go.



37

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:16.020

All right.



38

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:22.880

What I really want to do on this one is I want to get out of BHB and when I create a new order list



39

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.340

ordered list there we go.



40

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:28.370

Perfect.



41

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.880

Now we're going to come back to the HP again here because I love HP.



42

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.300

How am I going to leave HP by myself.



43

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.310

So now.



44

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.910

All right.



45

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:38.370

Perfect.



46

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:44.420

So make sure that you're so close right here right.



47

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.050

And then you bring it down here again.



48

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.030

Want to make sure we get this little tag right here.



49

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:52.910

We don't want to leave him by himself.



50

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:53.930

Right.



51

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:54.650

All right.



52

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.880

So I think we're good here.



53

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.240

And we have the they're in there.



54

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.930

All right.



55

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.740

Just making sure everything works fine.



56

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:06.200

All right.



57

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:11.510

So let's create a echo here.



58

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.700

Actually we should give our listen.



59

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.400

Let's just do the egg roll here first.



60

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.150

So let's echo a list item here.



61

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.440

If I can get this right that would be nice right.



62

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.590

And let's use a core brand right here



63

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:31.160

we go



64

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.560

and I'm just going to say in stock



65

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.080

perfect as good right what do you think.



66

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.230

Yeah yeah I agree with you.



67

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:49.930

Seriously let's go and check it out.



68

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:54.890

I think this is a time that we need to be applauding.



69

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:55.880

There we go.



70

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:00.610

We find all the be in double digits by typing the word b.



71

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:01.820

Isn't that nice.



72

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:03.080

So BMW.



73

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:07.760

Three twenty five only the results we won into our database.



74

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.080

Now we have these little dots.



75

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:10.380

We're going to take that off in a minute.



76

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.720

But so you can see that this is actually working.



77

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:19.750

We bring all the handles in and if I take Honda Civic There we go.



78

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:25.670

Or C C or V like that.



79

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.590

Perfect.



80

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:27.560

Isn't that awesome.



81

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:32.640

We're getting all these data from the database means testing interstate instantaneously.



82

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:36.410

There we go without actually refreshing the page.



83

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:38.770

You imagine the power that we got right now.



84

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:40.240

Do you imagine that.



85

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:41.050

Right.



86

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:42.450

I would just search for Belinda.



87

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:43.760

I don't know who Belinda is.



88

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:45.800

I don't know that name was just stuck in my head.



89

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:48.460

But anyway did you see the power in this.



90

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:56.900

You have a database with thousands of records and you can instantly bring any record you one out to



91

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:58.270

see it in a box.



92

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:01.260

Interesting ink instance dangerously.



93

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:05.040

Jesus I have such a bad language for that word.



94

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:06.330

I going to have to practice.



95

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:10.100

But anyway I think we did pretty good in here.



96

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:14.960

All right let's go ahead and install this really quick because I don't like to see those dots there.



97

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:16.010

Do you like to see those dots.



98

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:17.160

I don't think so.



99

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:22.100

So let's just make sure that we take those dots away and the reason why that's looking like this is



100

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:29.660

because we have a test center class right here that's making everything Center show you right now real



101

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:34.960

quick down here we have the test center here.



102

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:43.300

We take it off and then we go back to refresh and then B you see now everything here like this.



103

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:46.160

If you want it like that that's fine.



104

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:46.760

All right.



105

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:57.620

And now here while we are going to be doing is using some of those magic glasses here and I'm just going



106

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:08.480

to call this this is a predefined clouds by the way by the framework bootstrap on styled and that is



107

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:13.160

going to make everything Fredy be.



108

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:13.840

There we go.



109

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:17.980

Now we just have this onoda list on style there.



110

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:22.720

So if you want it on the center in here just put that test center there.



111

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:26.330

But as you can see here we are done.



112

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:27.220

All right.



113

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:29.570

We are done with our application.



114

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:32.100

You can do whatever you want in your database.



115

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:38.870

You can go back insert another dear friend row if you want and you can call this maybe Friday that's



116

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:40.340

a nice car isn't it.



117

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:41.210

I love Fridays.



118

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:44.720

Hopefully one day I will have a Friday right.



119

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.800

Why would I pay $100000 for a car.



120

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:54.970

I don't know even if I think even if I have 100 billion dollars I don't think I ever do that.



121

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:56.050

Yes.



122

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:56.600

I don't know.



123

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:57.740

It doesn't make sense but.



124

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:58.190

Yeah.



125

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:00.160

A hundred thousand.



126

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:00.910

I don't know.



127

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:06.040

Maybe maybe 50000 or something I don't know how to be.



128

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:09.280

I have to do a lot of things for poor people in the world first.



129

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:10.780

So be.



130

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:17.820

All right so we have a variety there we can type of be any fines of Ferrari you see that.



131

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:22.840

And I think we have a Lamborghini and we find the Lamborghini with the L.



132

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:24.190

Isn't that great.



133

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:25.220

Perfect.



134

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:31.160

So as you can see here we meet up location work and I mean you can implement this thing any size you



135

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:31.730

want.



136

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:34.700

And I mean you have that's working for you.



137

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:36.050

What more can you ask.



138

00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:42.090

And you can also look up age that's a little bit more and see all the parameters that you can pass through.



139

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:45.270

But you know the possibilities are endless.



140

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:47.270

Anyway thank you so much for watching this.



141

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:51.100

And I think we still have one or two more lectures below.



142

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:55.930

Just maybe give me just some tips on what to do next or something else.



143

00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:56.480

All right.



144

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:58.880

But if not I see you.



145

00:07:59.030 --> 00:07:59.660

Take care.



146

00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:00.990

Thank you for being here.



147

00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:02.150

It was a pleasure.



148

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:04.540

And have a blessed day.
