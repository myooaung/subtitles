00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:02,150
Welcome back my students.

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:09,780
So we are here in the mail and we create an idea and the last lecture there so we get to actually target

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:13,080
is formed by doing that by actually with his ID.

4
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:20,280
So let's go ahead to our Jake werie right here and let's make sure that we are right after this function

5
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:28,390
ends right here and between this is going to be the document right here right.

6
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:36,180
Dokument This is the commands ready function.

7
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:39,850
Just make sure that we put some type of common here here's what we know.

8
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:40,310
All right.

9
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:41,980
And all right.

10
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:48,380
So the first thing is we need to target our button right.

11
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:57,070
So let's target it like this ad form at with an idea of course at car form and then we're going to use

12
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:59,320
a function called submit.

13
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:03,430
All right so basically we got to actually take this when we submit the form.

14
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:04,000
Right.

15
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:10,120
And of course we can put a callback function here right.

16
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:16,460
And we don't actually create this function.

17
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:21,370
And let's just put this variable there because we're going to be using it here to see just to prevent

18
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:26,500
the form from submitted submitting pre-event.

19
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:29,230
And you can see that does this editor.

20
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:36,400
I was already writing bracket's is already writing that that function prevent default.

21
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:43,030
All right so now now if I want to go back here and I try to submit that data from this form it doesn't

22
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:43,570
go anywhere.

23
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:46,870
Now if you have that you see right now I'm going to comment this.

24
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:53,610
I'll save it come back here and I click and you can see that he's already sending information that doesn't

25
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:57,210
wouldn't want to do that we want to pick up the information before he sends it.

26
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,800
So that's why we use in this function right there to prevent that.

27
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:09,380
Come back here and now we clean this up a little bit to refresh and click it and nothing happens.

28
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:13,760
All right so it prevents the default functionality of it.

29
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:17,250
Now we need to do something called serialise right.

30
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:22,120
We need to take all that data and I'm going to call this phone data.

31
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,660
We're going to take all the data from the form like this.

32
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:36,020
This serialise So we're going to serialize the form and you can see the function right here in my brackets.

33
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:36,440
All right.

34
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:40,640
So now we got all the data from that form right there on this variable.

35
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,110
Beautiful.

36
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:49,390
Now we also going to need your mail so that we can send our information somewhere our data and we get

37
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:54,470
to pick this up from where from this ETR.

38
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:55,340
There you go.

39
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:01,580
Look at that right there from the action remember.

40
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:03,390
So we're going to see action.

41
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:04,690
There we go.

42
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:05,140
All right.

43
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:08,490
So we can even alert this hour if you want to see it.

44
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:12,980
We can Adlard your L here.

45
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:21,710
And let's just click here and you can see that it actually doesn't have anything that is actually put

46
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:23,520
or you are out there in that form.

47
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:34,610
Let's go to the in the form and make sure they submit it to add on the score cards that BHP.

48
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:35,740
All right.

49
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:42,890
So now we refresh here click on it and now you can see that it's picking up that actually there.

50
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:44,810
All right.

51
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:51,660
We can also if you want to see it.

52
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:55,180
Also check the full state of

53
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,720
save refresh.

54
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:08,140
Click on it and you can see that it is actually taken in the car on the score name.

55
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:09,490
All right.

56
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:11,950
So he's taking the pulls data as well.

57
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:17,820
All right.

58
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:26,430
So let's go up a little bit here make sure that everything is so that we can put a little comment here

59
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:39,840
real quick and this code adds cars to database table cars something like that.

60
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,230
All right.

61
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:45,810
So in the next lecture we'll continue adding doing some more processing here so that where we can send

62
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:48,810
this information to our database and execute it.

63
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:53,030
So thank you so much and I'll see you in the next lecture.
