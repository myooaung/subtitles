00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:07,470
Hi welcome back my awesome student on this lecture here we're finally going to test to see if our data

2
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:10,560
is actually being sent if our request has been sent to the server.

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,190
Right.

4
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:15,900
So we need to get some type of response back just to make sure that everything is working fine right.

5
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:17,370
We roll the school here.

6
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:19,790
We don't even know if we have a mistake here somewhere.

7
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:20,550
Right.

8
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,650
So let's go ahead and go to our search got BHB.

9
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:26,200
All right.

10
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,590
And just because we are sending a post requests I'm just going to take this esteeming out of this since

11
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:33,120
we don't need it anymore.

12
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:39,390
Actually I'm going to leave it there and just going to comment this all because I want to give you these

13
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:40,670
files at the end of this.

14
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:41,370
Right.

15
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,850
So you can have something that you don't have to write everything from scratch.

16
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:49,860
I hope you're writing everything from scratch that way you can learn more to be honest with you.

17
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:58,730
All right so now we are getting a POST request being sent to this page right here.

18
00:00:58,730 --> 00:00:59,030
Right.

19
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:02,620
So the post requests a few If I go back.

20
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:11,450
Well let me just go back to that in that we are sending a key with it right here called search and we

21
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:14,600
are sending the values of this variable right to this variable.

22
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:17,300
We have these values here from the user.

23
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:17,870
Right.

24
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:25,100
So let's go ahead and search for that key right here in this Superguy o'War Ray Ray.

25
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:31,640
And I was going to say search and now we need to assign it to something we actually don't need to but

26
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:35,600
I like to assign it to a very well I'm going to assign it to a very we'll call search.

27
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,180
What are the odds of that right.

28
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,810
And you know we're going to do.

29
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:44,990
I'm going to echo this and try to see if I can get some response back just to make sure that everything

30
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:45,800
is working fine.

31
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:49,170
Make sure you put a semicolon there right.

32
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:50,750
So I think we're good here.

33
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:52,110
Let's go ahead and check it out.

34
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:59,180
Let's go to our page and get a refresher here.

35
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:01,350
And I'm just going to say hello.

36
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:02,800
Look at that.

37
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,390
We were already getting a response back.

38
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:06,880
This is age outs right now working.

39
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:10,510
Hello my dear my dear student

40
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:14,660
All right.

41
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:19,750
You see that instant result from the server.

42
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:23,570
This is no refreshing at all in the speech.

43
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:28,900
Imagine the possibilities when once we start searching our database with this every day all the resorts

44
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,250
are going to be instantaneous here.

45
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:31,790
So

46
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:43,170
right perfect Hope you're really enjoying this class.

47
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:50,370
It's my goal to you know just for you to maybe send me a message later on tell me how awesome this course

48
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:55,890
is on what you're learning and maybe see more of you.

49
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:57,030
Mauldin courses.

50
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:57,710
All right.

51
00:02:57,930 --> 00:02:59,510
So it's really a pleasure for me.

52
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:06,100
I love teaching my students and preparing them with knowledge affordable knowledge free knowledge.

53
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:08,090
You know the word to you.

54
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:13,290

Anyway thank you so much.

57
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:17,990
We're going to make this story very short.

58
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:23,520
And because I don't want to just drag you here with a 20 minute tutorial and on the next lecture here

59
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:29,760
we're going to start building our Querrey into our database and making sure that we can pull some data

60
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,170
out of it.

61
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:30,900
All right.
