00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.540

All right welcome back my students.



2

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:08.790

So we are going to be learning how to display data from our table here with age but this is going to



3

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.280

be a super super exciting lecture.



4

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:12.780

All right.



5

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.530

And I could say probably lectures because it's not going to be just one lecture is going to be a couple.



6

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:18.540

All right so let's learn how to do that first.



7

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.080

We need to actually for those of you that don't have this Colma right here and post data for these at



8

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:30.840

car forum at car call here for Jake where we make sure that you add that are there.



9

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.070

All right.



10

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.780

That's probably something that I took off and when I was playing around with this.



11

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.430

All right just make sure that you have that there.



12

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.670

So that way your other function can work properly this function right here.



13

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:43.620

All right.



14

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.320

All right so we are displaying data from our inventory and we are also adding data but we only displaying



15

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.810

data when we search here.



16

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.330

It would be nice to see all that data down here permanently.



17

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.760

So let's do that right now.



18

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.350

First thing that I want to do is actually create a div to hold that data.



19

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:09.600

So let's go down here and let's create another rule right here.



20

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:10.690

A new element.



21

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.710

And you def would a class of row.



22

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:15.690

All right.



23

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:16.800

Perfect.



24

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:24.420

And let's create a another div with a class of call at six.



25

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:25.180

All right.



26

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.830

And inside here let's create a table with a class of table just to make it look nice.



27

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:37.730

In bootstrap our right super simple to do.



28

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.830

So what else.



29

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:57.720

So now once we create this we need to create a d head for the table where TR actually TR and three actually



30

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:58.080

two.



31

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.980

Th.



32

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.430

All right so if you're wondering how I did it again I'm using Emett which is that the plug in for this



33

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.490

for many coeditors out there which allow you to actually write code a lot faster and have a free course



34

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.510

on that by the way called Emett.



35

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.370

So if you want to look at that it would help you reach the Molesey assess really fast.



36

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:25.360

So we're going to put the idea here on the first tee heading this is for the table heading and now we



37

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.960

are going to be actually creating the T body right here and the body is going to have the cold coming



38

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:34.700

from the BHB cold the right we agents.



39

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.420

So we're going to leave that like that.



40

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.390

And we're bringing that call in a minute.



41

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:45.780

Make sure let's put this put an idea here of car showing.



42

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.440

Show cars.



43

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.760

All right safe perfect.



44

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.270

So let's go up here and let's start writing our Jake where we.



45

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.750

Let's make sure that we know I'm going to pull my mouse over here because this tells me when this cold



46

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.150

ends and I end up with my mouse here and this tells me when this one ends.



47

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:18.230

So I just I could put a comment here and says at car function code not cart in that Codie function and



48

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.100

something like that.



49

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.610

All right.



50

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.650

I'm going to start writing my call right here.



51

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.690

So the first thing is to select this information that we need.



52

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.790

So I actually you know what we don't need to select anything.



53

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:40.950

I'm going to use that Ageod's this one here because in this code the I show you how to use this pose



54

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:46.920

function here from Jay Querrey on this one we going to go back to these agents because actually I like



55

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.430

it better.



56

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:49.000

All right.



57

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:54.280

So anyway we're going to open up our agents here.



58

00:03:54.380 --> 00:04:01.740

And the first thing that we want to actually pass is the euro and we'll make a page that we haven't



59

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.120

made yet but we will.



60

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:09.210

It's going to be called display cars that BHP we've got to make the following a minute.



61

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:12.430

That's where are all our APHC call is going to be.



62

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:19.310

And then will you say you know what this is going to be type we can pull whatever type we want.



63

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:27.520

I'm just going to use post here portaloo coma and Hoopes right here.



64

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:34.920

And then the success and we'll make this a function of course Dye's going to take



65

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.190

it's going to bring some data.



66

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:39.650

Right.



67

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:45.720

Let's just put Show cartes right.



68

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.400

Perfect and we're going to see if



69

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.070

and I would say if not show cars



70

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:07.060

show cars that error right then we can display this information here.



71

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:08.250

That would be nice.



72

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:13.890

And what we're going to be doing is going to target that idea that we have down there which is car show



73

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.670

cars I believe that's cool down here and let's just copy it.



74

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:23.960

Show cars.



75

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:28.140

HD a male and we'll put in we'll put that data in there.



76

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:28.680

Right.



77

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:31.840

But now let's just put something here and see if it works.



78

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:32.310

Hello.



79

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:35.150

It works right.



80

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:45.270

Safe and let's actually I don't think actually we see the table where we are now getting data from here.



81

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:51.250

So let's just take this call.



82

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:52.680

All right.



83

00:05:56.290 --> 00:06:03.210

Let's check in Speth element Bansal is saying that the server responding with start for a fourth course



84

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.050

because he's now finding that you are out.



85

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:10.020

So we need to make to you or else that's OK let's just think this code is really good right now.



86

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:15.400

So let's actually make that BHB page on that net lecture.



87

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:17.450

So make sure that you copy this down.



88

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:18.340

All right.



89

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:25.340

Let me just put this a little bit more condensed so that you can see it better and you can copy it.



90

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:25.890

All right.



91

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:27.270

So I see you in the next lecture.



92

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:28.020

Take care.
