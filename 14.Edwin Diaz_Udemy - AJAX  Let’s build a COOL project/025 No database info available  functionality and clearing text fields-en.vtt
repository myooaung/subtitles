00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:06.990

Welcome back my students so I'm going to be actually fixing something from that you're actually not



2

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.330

fixing it but adding some more functionality.



3

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:17.630

Well we know that every time we add some type of item in the database for example I don't know.



4

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.440

Let me see if I can come up with a car name.



5

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:20.780

All right I got one.



6

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.430

I was getting better guys.



7

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:27.900

I was actually really good when I first started this course but I don't know what happened.



8

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.190

But anyway if I had a car here you can see that we get the response right here.



9

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:36.380

But this doesn't clear so we need to clear this for him right here.



10

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.170

All right.



11

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:37.860

All right.



12

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.130

So I got the easy fix for that in this lecture.



13

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:46.950

I also want to add that functionality where we search for a car and we can't find it in the database



14

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.870

then it will give us back a response saying listen you know the car was not found.



15

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.630

Sorry we don't have or something like that.



16

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:54.250

Right.



17

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.500

So let's try to kill two birds in one shot.



18

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.220

All right.



19

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.830

So if you're in that stage a male and you were cold that's the car



20

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.840

right here right below here I'm going to add another piece of cold.



21

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:17.720

Once this is finished getting the response back I want to reset the form so I'm going to do this like



22

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:18.480

this.



23

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:31.420

I'm going to grab a the idea of the form right here to target it via Jake where we and my.



24

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:31.970

Would go.



25

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.850

So I'm targeting the form and what I want to do with the form is reset it.



26

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:42.660

So they're going to reset the form the first in that's of the form.



27

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.580

And let's just reset it like this reset.



28

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:48.340

There we go.



29

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.410

And you can also do this via javascript.



30

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.330

You get the element by ID and you do the reset.



31

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.840

All right.



32

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.240

But anyway set.



33

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:04.440

And there's another way of actually doing this by setting the value of this value right here.



34

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.310

The value of this input.



35

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.540

I'm sorry to empty.



36

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:09.110

All right.



37

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.370

Some developers do that but I'd like to reset the form.



38

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:13.230

All right.



39

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:21.390

If this doesn't work for you try targeting the input field and setting up the empty value to it.



40

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:27.970

All right so now if we had another car for example then see if I can come up with something really fast.



41

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:28.520

All right.



42

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.950

I think I have it on day at car.



43

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.230

Now we at the car and now the form is reset it.



44

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:39.880

Right so nice reset.



45

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.620

We're back to this is looking better by the day right guys and ladies.



46

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.150

All right so search in the form.



47

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.310

All right so now we can find stuff right.



48

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:55.280

But if we don't have the car for it's so you know let's just say I'm looking for.



49

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:58.410

I don't know Hummer.



50

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:59.450

And we don't have it.



51

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:00.910

It doesn't show anything.



52

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:06.270

So let's go back to our BHB search for search file.



53

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:07.900

This is where the problem is.



54

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:08.790

Right.



55

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:17.980

So we select everything from from cars where tidal surge or whatever and with title like search.



56

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:24.700

All right so what we need to do here is we need to come up with a way to count the records in our database.



57

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.420

All right so if we don't find anything when we're searching then we displayed something else.



58

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.280

So just cold cold this in a variable called count.



59

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.940

And I'm going to use a function call my Eskew a line from rolls who's going to count the rows in the



60

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:50.190

database and all we have to pass to that function is search the result set coming back like that and



61

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.640

save it.



62

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.010

Now we have the count of the rules inside the database.



63

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.870

All right.



64

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:02.620

So now we don't want to do this unless the count is you know unless we have something right.



65

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:03.950

So let's do that.



66

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:15.700

Let's create an IF condition here and we're going to say if count all right is less then zero right



67

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:25.430

is less or equal to zero than one HQ whatever below.



68

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:26.970

Right.



69

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.010

Right now we are echoing this right here.



70

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.950

So if it's less than or equal to zero we want to echo something else.



71

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:48.650

We're going to call Sorry we don't have that car available Sunday like that right else.



72

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:53.040

That means we have something and we can't secure this cold right here.



73

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:06.470

All right.



74

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.970

So I pasted that basically that cold inside the else.



75

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:11.120

Let's see if it works ok.



76

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:12.180

If not we'll debug it.



77

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:13.380

Don't worry.



78

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:17.070

Let's refresh this.



79

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:22.860

Will go so we don't have s available on Dyson's stock



80

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:26.290

right.



81

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.330

S it's not.



82

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:35.150

Say something like example for sorry we don't have that car.



83

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:36.590

Right.



84

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:39.030

So our application is looking pretty good right.



85

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:40.920

It's getting better and better by the minute.



86

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:42.360

Well by the lecture.



87

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:42.960

All right.



88

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:47.320

So if you're happy with the course so far don't forget to give me a review in the course it really helps



89

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:47.890

a lot.



90

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:51.140

And you know it motivates me to keep making more lectures.



91

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.610

Again thank you and I'll see you in the next lectures.



92

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:53.930

Take care.
