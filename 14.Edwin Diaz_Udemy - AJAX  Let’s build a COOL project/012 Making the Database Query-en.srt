1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:05,590
Welcome back my ideas today it is a pleasure to have you here again.

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:11,580
Now on this lecture you were going to write some Ph.D. since our database application right here our

3
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:12,990
request has been sent to the server.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,570
We're getting our response back to our little application right so we say hello and we get it right

5
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:19,360
here.

6
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,860
So this is working now we're done with it.

7
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,830
So let's go ahead and concentrate on our Ph.D..

8
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,290
Now we do need to be echoing anything out.

9
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:32,130
So let's just take that a quarter there and let's start writing on Querrey How about that.

10
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:32,610
Right.

11
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:35,360
Finally some PH Because I love BHB.

12
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:42,920
Let's go ahead and check first if this which is this here is empty or not.

13
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:46,960
Because we don't want to you know empty information to be sent to our server.

14
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:54,480
So we're just going to say just a simple statement here we're just going to say if it's not actually

15
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:57,770
empty was going to use this function empty.

16
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,280
If it's not empty

17
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:08,160
right if it's not empty then we want to do something with it right.

18
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:14,260
So let's just say we're going to make a query when to select

19
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:18,450
all from where.

20
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:33,790
From our users table actually is not use it's cars where cars like and that's the special key where

21
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:35,670
they used to find similar things right.

22
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:43,920
Or something started with certain words and search and that percentage right here.

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,910
You know I don't know what I'm doing.

24
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:49,960
Just make sure you watch my BHB course is going to teach you everything that you need to know about

25
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,060
my you know writing stuff like this.

26
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:52,990
Right.

27
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:54,980
Of statements.

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,260
All right.

29
00:01:55,260 --> 00:02:04,110
So we're going to start searching our database for anything else when we type here the first word is

30
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,700
going to find something in our database right.

31
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:10,920
So if he's not empty we do that.

32
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:14,450
So the next thing for us to do is actually send that query in.

33
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:28,710
So I'm just going to say something like Ajax search query that sounds more semantic right search query

34
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:36,880
and let's just send it with my lie and go Kohary

35
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:48,450
send it in with a connection and let's send it in with that with this with equerry query.

36
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:48,860
All right.

37
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,710
Perfect.

38
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:53,370
Make sure the search actually spelled it wrong.

39
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,700
I'd also like to check on my connection.

40
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:57,930
All right.

41
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:58,990
I like to check them every day.

42
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:01,560
I don't like to be writing called that.

43
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:04,850
Maybe later on is going to give me a problem if I don't check it before right.

44
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:07,840
So let's make sure that that query is actually successful.

45
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:14,530
So if it's not quite what I want you to do BHB is go and die.

46
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:18,220
Actually now really just killed every script below there.

47
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:20,520
So in a way die.

48
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,720
That's a really good name for it right.

49
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:26,700
My ask you lie error and give me an error.

50
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:31,260
Also send in the connections so that way you know to give me an error right.

51
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,800
Especially for this connection here.

52
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:38,380
All right so if our query is not successful is going to give us an arrow.

53
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:40,450
All right there we go.

54
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:42,150
No arrows means good.

55
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:50,530
So if I make any mistake here on our Querrey and I come here and I type in the day and we get this big

56
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:51,340
error here.

57
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,560
Perfect.

58
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:54,810
So our core is actually working.

59
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:56,580
And I think we are good here.

60
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,610
Let's just make sure.

61
00:03:58,690 --> 00:03:59,270
All right.

62
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:02,210
So in the next part here I'm going to leave this lecture.

63
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:08,200
I like to make a short and sweet so that you can have some coffee time or maybe some wine time and and

64
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:08,860
relax.

65
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:09,430
All right.

66
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:15,700
So on the next one we're going to continue building this Querrey here and that will build a nice function

67
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,790
that's going to pull everything from the database.

68
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,070
Right.

69
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:23,410
So thank you again for giving me this opportunity it's really really a pleasure.

70
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:24,040
All right.

71
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:26,100
So I'll see you in the next lecture.

72
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:26,980
Take care.
