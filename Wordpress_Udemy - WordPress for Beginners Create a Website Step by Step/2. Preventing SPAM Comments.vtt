Hello everyone in this lesson we will learn about preventing spam comments at the heart and soul of

00:08.700 --> 00:17.190
this lesson is a plug in named a Kismet the kismet plug in will automatically block 99 percent of incoming

00:17.190 --> 00:20.240
spam comments without further ado.

00:20.250 --> 00:23.320
Let me show you how to get started using a kismet.

00:23.550 --> 00:28.980
OK so here we are on the home page of my web site and the first thing I want to do is jump over to the

00:28.980 --> 00:36.510
Wordpress admin dashboard so I will click on this top left link and now in the left hand side bar look

00:36.510 --> 00:38.100
for plug ins.

00:38.220 --> 00:40.050
It's a little more than halfway down.

00:40.050 --> 00:42.630
Go ahead and click on plug ins.

00:42.630 --> 00:49.090
All right now this screen shows us a list of all currently installed plugins.

00:49.110 --> 00:55.000
There is a difference however between an installed plug in and an active plug in.

00:55.230 --> 01:01.030
So for example remember this responsive light box plug in that we added several lessons ago.

01:01.290 --> 01:07.320
It's using a light blue background and the light blue background signifies that it's activated.

01:07.320 --> 01:13.560
These other three plug ins are plug ins that I personally did not download or install right so I didn't

01:13.560 --> 01:18.740
search for a Kismet Hello Dolly or jet pack by WordPress.

01:18.840 --> 01:20.830
WordPress comes with a few plug ins.

01:20.880 --> 01:24.110
Out of the box but it doesn't activate them for you.

01:24.150 --> 01:31.410
Back to the task at hand though we want to begin using a Kismet So 99 percent of the time you will see

01:31.410 --> 01:34.640
a Kismet in your list of installed plugins.

01:34.770 --> 01:38.330
But if for some reason you do not see a Kismet here.

01:38.430 --> 01:41.770
Perhaps your web hosting company removed it for some reason.

01:41.790 --> 01:44.900
All you need to do is click on this add new button

01:48.140 --> 01:57.480
and then from this screen use this top right search field and search for a kismet.

01:57.520 --> 02:03.550
So here it is it's the first results and we see that it has over a million active installs.

02:03.700 --> 02:09.760
So if for some reason you did not see a Kismet in your initial install plug in screen you can install

02:09.760 --> 02:12.040
it from the screen after you search for it.

02:12.220 --> 02:15.130
But let me jump back to my initial plug in screen.

02:15.160 --> 02:20.500
So from this list of installed plugins on a Kismet just click the Activate button

02:23.140 --> 02:28.080
OK now that activated the kismet plug in within our WordPress website.

02:28.120 --> 02:34.690
But next we need to activate or create an account with the kismet right so just like you would create

02:34.690 --> 02:38.420
an account if you wanted to use Facebook or Twitter or G-mail.

02:38.440 --> 02:41.430
We need to go and create an account with a kismet.

02:41.590 --> 02:46.360
So as soon as we activated the plug in we saw this green and blue bar towards the top.

02:46.360 --> 02:53.720
Go ahead and click the blue activate your Kismet the count button and then from this screen click this

02:53.720 --> 02:56.410
blue get your API key button.

02:58.470 --> 03:05.700
That will open a new tab in my web browser and take me to a Kismet dot com slash Wordpress and from

03:05.700 --> 03:06.420
this website.

03:06.420 --> 03:11.210
Go ahead and click the large blue button that reads get in a Kismet API key

03:13.910 --> 03:17.040
and on this screen you're just creating a new account.

03:17.090 --> 03:23.360
So enter your email address and then invent a username for yourself and then type in a password.

03:23.510 --> 03:27.500
Once you fill out that form and click the submit button you'll be taken to this screen.

03:27.680 --> 03:35.200
In our example we are going to use the basic or free plan to go ahead and click this get basic button.

03:35.320 --> 03:41.240
Now towards the top right here we can see that the Kismet is asking us if we want to give it a donation.

03:41.260 --> 03:48.130
So by default it looks like it's set to a $36 per year donation but I can just drag this down to the

03:48.160 --> 03:52.350
full left edge and say zero dollars a year.

03:52.360 --> 03:55.750
So I do not want to make a donation to the kismet software.

03:55.840 --> 04:01.780
Once I do that then the form on the left hand side no longer asks me for a credit card makes sense because

04:01.780 --> 04:03.580
now I'm not paying any money.

04:03.790 --> 04:08.980
So go ahead and enter your first and last name and then click the blue continue button.

04:08.980 --> 04:09.400
All right.

04:09.400 --> 04:12.550
Now this is the screen we've been waiting for.

04:12.610 --> 04:17.300
Here we see that a Kismet is giving us our very own API key.

04:17.320 --> 04:21.730
Now I've blacked out my API keys and you can't see it just for security reasons.

04:21.910 --> 04:28.090
But when you log into the kismet Web site it will give you your own uniquely generated string of characters

04:28.090 --> 04:28.770
here.

04:29.050 --> 04:33.280
So go ahead and select those characters and copy them to your clipboard.

04:33.520 --> 04:39.310
And now we can jump back to the other tab and our web browser that has our WordPress admin dashboard

04:39.310 --> 04:40.090
open.

04:40.210 --> 04:43.000
And if you can't remember how we got to this screen that's OK.

04:43.030 --> 04:44.810
Let me show you one more time.

04:44.830 --> 04:50.740
So in the left hand admin side bar you can always just click on plugins and then under a Kismat you

04:50.740 --> 04:57.440
can click Settings right here or you can click this large activate your Kismet account button.

04:57.520 --> 04:59.230
So either will do the trick.

04:59.530 --> 05:05.520
And now down here where it says manually enter an API key as you might have guessed.

05:05.530 --> 05:09.910
Now you can just paste in from your clipboard that API key.

05:09.940 --> 05:10.980
So once you paste it in.

05:10.990 --> 05:18.560
Then click the used this key button and congratulations your web site is now protected by a kismat.

05:18.650 --> 05:23.290
I'm not sure if it's really necessary but just to play it safe why don't we click this save changes

05:23.300 --> 05:23.920
button.

05:27.050 --> 05:27.830
And that's it.

05:27.830 --> 05:31.700
We are good to go now before we bring this lesson to a close.

05:31.730 --> 05:37.140
I want to answer a question you might have because you might be wondering how does a Kismet work.

05:37.220 --> 05:39.050
How does it block spam comments.

05:39.050 --> 05:41.510
How does it know which comment is spam.

05:41.510 --> 05:49.310
Now I don't claim to 100 percent understand how a Kismet works but a big part of any anti-spam tool

05:49.400 --> 05:51.350
goes a little something like this.

05:51.350 --> 05:58.180
So for example in the sidebar if we click on comments remember this screen from an earlier lesson here

05:58.180 --> 06:00.370
we can moderate the comments.

06:00.370 --> 06:02.530
So that means we can approve or unapproved.

06:02.560 --> 06:06.420
And we can mark comment as spam or send it to the trash.

06:06.580 --> 06:12.670
Well the idea is that if millions of people are using a Kismet on their WordPress Web site and if you

06:12.670 --> 06:19.690
see a spam comment and market as spam the kismet software watches for patterns and it notices which

06:19.690 --> 06:24.600
type of comments are marked as spam and it's got a huge sample to work from right.

06:24.630 --> 06:27.760
There's millions of people using the equipment software.

06:27.850 --> 06:35.010
So over time it builds up this huge database of what spam looks like of what spam smells like.

06:35.020 --> 06:38.630
So the idea is that the hard work has already been done for you.

06:38.710 --> 06:42.560
Millions of people have already marked comments as spam.

06:42.580 --> 06:48.660
So ninety nine point nine percent of spam will not even make it to this comment screen on your Web site.

06:48.850 --> 06:53.070
The vast majority of spam will just end up in this spam filter here.

06:53.200 --> 06:59.800
So if I click on spam you can see it says no comments found but over time a Kismet will do its job and

06:59.800 --> 07:04.490
just like your email how most of your email that spam goes into the spam folder.

07:04.600 --> 07:08.800
Well all of your spam comments will go into this sort of spam folder.

07:08.890 --> 07:15.880
Now nothing's perfect so Kismet will not catch 100 percent of spam so from time to time you might see

07:15.880 --> 07:22.360
a spam comment show up in this main comments area and you can help the world by just marking it as spam

07:22.840 --> 07:29.430
and that's actually going to bring this lesson to a close in our next lesson we will learn about a plugin

07:29.470 --> 07:36.280
named discuss discuss we'll let the visitors of our Web site leave comments without having to type in

07:36.460 --> 07:37.980
their name in email.

07:38.050 --> 07:44.020
Right so discuss will let your visitors leave comments via their Twitter account or via their Facebook

07:44.020 --> 07:44.860
account.

07:44.860 --> 07:49.990
It's a really neat plug and you've probably seen it used on other WordPress web sites without even realizing

07:49.990 --> 07:51.250
what you are seeing.

07:51.250 --> 07:52.890
Discuss is entirely optional.

07:52.890 --> 07:57.960
You do not need to use it but I think it might be a lot of fun to take it for a test drive.

07:58.150 --> 08:01.820
Let's keep rolling and I will see you in the next lesson.
