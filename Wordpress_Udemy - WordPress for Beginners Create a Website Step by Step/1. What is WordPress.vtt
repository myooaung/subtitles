00:01.120 --> 00:10.320
Hello everyone in this lesson we will answer the question what exactly is Wordpress the boring soulless

00:10.360 --> 00:16.140
answer is that WordPress is a free tool that helps us create Web sites and blogs.

00:16.370 --> 00:16.680
OK.

00:16.690 --> 00:20.620
But humans don't learn from boring soulless answers right.

00:20.620 --> 00:23.200
We learn from real world examples.

00:23.410 --> 00:30.220
So in this lesson I'm going to share my screen and visually show you what Wordpress is.

00:30.460 --> 00:36.070
It's important to point out that in this lesson I do not want you to worry about following along step

00:36.070 --> 00:38.110
by step on your computer.

00:38.170 --> 00:43.900
In our next lesson you'll get your hands dirty and learn how to set up your own WordPress website that

00:43.900 --> 00:45.290
you are the owner of.

00:45.490 --> 00:50.010
OK but in this current lesson I want you to take your hands off the keyboard.

00:50.230 --> 00:53.450
Sit back relax and just watch.

00:53.470 --> 00:57.870
So right now we're looking at a completed example of a WordPress Web site.

00:57.910 --> 01:03.670
I think that oftentimes the best way to understand something is to begin by looking at a finished product

01:03.760 --> 01:09.400
and dissect it and then once you have a general understanding of what your goal is and the basic moving

01:09.400 --> 01:14.790
pieces involved at that point then it's easy to create your own brand new project from scratch.

01:14.980 --> 01:20.500
So here we see the home page of this example web site and up in the header we see links to different

01:20.500 --> 01:21.250
pages.

01:21.250 --> 01:29.590
So if I click on About Us Here is the About Us page it's got a bit of text an intro video a photo a

01:29.590 --> 01:30.800
bit of text.

01:30.880 --> 01:35.580
If I scroll back up to the navigation we see there's a link named photo gallery.

01:35.860 --> 01:38.370
So if I click that takes me to another page.

01:38.860 --> 01:41.730
This page dedicated to all of these different photographs.

01:41.770 --> 01:46.870
And if we click on one of these thumbnail versions a larger full screen version appears and then we

01:46.870 --> 01:51.820
can click these arrows down at the bottom to cycle through the photos or we can click this X in the

01:51.820 --> 01:54.620
top right to close out of the full screen preview.

01:54.800 --> 01:55.080
OK.

01:55.090 --> 01:58.150
So that's the photo gallery page in the header navigation.

01:58.150 --> 02:00.700
We also see another link named travel.

02:00.790 --> 02:07.220
So if I click that this travel page is a collection of different stories or posts related to travel.

02:07.570 --> 02:10.940
So first we see a trip to the Midwest.

02:11.040 --> 02:17.100
I scroll down further resee trip to the west coast and finally trip to the east coast.

02:17.470 --> 02:23.320
And let's say a visitor of this website was interested in the trip to the west coast story after they

02:23.320 --> 02:24.690
read this initial paragraph.

02:24.700 --> 02:29.920
They could click on this continue reading button and that would take them to this new page with the

02:29.920 --> 02:30.970
full story

02:33.760 --> 02:35.650
backup in the header navigation.

02:35.650 --> 02:38.710
We also see we have a page named recipes.

02:38.710 --> 02:41.960
So if I click on that it's similar to the travel page.

02:41.980 --> 02:45.730
So now we have a collection of stories that are about recipes.

02:45.760 --> 02:49.990
So the first one is Greek salad and we see another one.

02:49.990 --> 02:54.290
Homemade french bread and finally easy spaghetti.

02:54.380 --> 02:59.510
And again if we are interested in any of those we can click on the continue reading button or the title

02:59.510 --> 03:02.240
itself back up in the header navigation.

03:02.240 --> 03:04.990
Finally we have a page named contact us.

03:05.000 --> 03:11.640
So let me click on that on this page we see the company's telephone number and their address.

03:11.670 --> 03:17.000
If I scroll down a bit we see an interactive Google Maps widget.

03:17.050 --> 03:21.720
This allows you to show your visitors where your corporate offices or something along those lines.

03:21.940 --> 03:26.560
If I scroll down further we see a contact form that visitors can fill out.

03:26.620 --> 03:32.200
So they enter their name their email subject line they can choose the service they are interested in.

03:32.200 --> 03:34.290
So the reason they're contacting you.

03:34.690 --> 03:38.630
And then obviously they can type out a message to you and click send.

03:39.010 --> 03:44.260
So that's the Contact Us page if I scroll back up to the top and click on the logo here.

03:44.590 --> 03:48.010
That takes me back to the home page and that's the Web site.

03:48.010 --> 03:49.090
In a nutshell.

03:49.150 --> 03:53.980
Now so far we haven't seen anything specifically related to WordPress.

03:54.010 --> 03:58.020
All we've seen so far is a typical Web site just like any other.

03:58.030 --> 04:03.090
So the question becomes where and how does WordPress fit into the equation.

04:03.370 --> 04:08.490
Well let's imagine we are the owners of this Web site and we want to make a few changes to it.

04:08.500 --> 04:15.340
So for example if I click back to the About Us page let's imagine we are not happy with this opening

04:15.340 --> 04:16.990
paragraph of text.

04:17.080 --> 04:17.880
We want to change.

04:17.890 --> 04:19.960
We want to make a few edits to it.

04:20.050 --> 04:25.670
Now the first thing we need to do is prove to WordPress that we are the owners of the Web site.

04:25.960 --> 04:26.220
Right.

04:26.230 --> 04:27.790
Because this isn't Wikipedia.

04:27.790 --> 04:32.860
We don't want just anyone from the general public who visits our Web site to be able to edit our Web

04:32.860 --> 04:33.730
site.

04:33.730 --> 04:39.730
So to prove to WordPress that we are indeed the owners of this Web site we need to visit the log in

04:39.730 --> 04:40.480
page.

04:40.630 --> 04:44.230
So let me switch over to a new tab in my web browser.

04:44.740 --> 04:47.780
This is the log in page for my wordpress.

04:48.010 --> 04:51.600
For now don't worry about how to navigate to this screen.

04:51.760 --> 04:54.760
We will cover that in detail in our next lesson.

04:54.760 --> 05:00.430
For now just know that I'm going to log in with my username and password to prove to WordPress that

05:00.430 --> 05:02.240
this is my web site.

05:05.950 --> 05:11.200
Once I sign in wordpress will take me over to this administrator dashboard screen.

05:11.500 --> 05:15.790
Now the general public will never ever ever see this screen.

05:15.790 --> 05:19.640
This section is only for the eyes of the owner of the Web site.

05:19.870 --> 05:23.910
OK so this is where we edit and manage and build the Web site.

05:24.190 --> 05:26.100
Now let's get back to the task at hand.

05:26.140 --> 05:33.150
So remember back on our Web site we want to edit this text that lives on the About Us page.

05:33.160 --> 05:34.570
Now the keyword there is.

05:34.570 --> 05:38.870
Page We are interested in the About Us page.

05:38.950 --> 05:45.360
So over in the administrator dashboard along the left hand side of the screen there is an item in this

05:45.370 --> 05:53.790
menu named pages so I'm going to click that and then word press will show me a list of all of the pages

05:53.790 --> 05:55.030
on my web site.

05:55.050 --> 05:58.650
There's no limit to how many pages you can have on a WordPress site.

05:58.650 --> 06:04.260
If we did want to create a new one we could just click this button that says add new but in our case

06:04.260 --> 06:06.260
right now we don't want to create a new page.

06:06.270 --> 06:10.860
We want to edit the existing About Us page so here it is.

06:10.860 --> 06:18.410
It's the first page in the list so I'll click that and now from this screen I can edit the page if I

06:18.410 --> 06:24.380
wanted to change the title of the page I could use this field so I can type here but we want to leave

06:24.380 --> 06:26.060
the title about us.

06:26.060 --> 06:31.760
Remember our goal was to edit this intro paragraph so maybe after this first sentence I want to add

06:31.760 --> 06:34.190
a new sentence that reads.

06:34.190 --> 06:39.190
Our company has been around for over a decade.

06:39.740 --> 06:45.770
Maybe I even want this new sentence to be bold so I can just use my cursor to highlight the text and

06:45.770 --> 06:50.420
then within this menu we see the traditional icon for bold.

06:50.420 --> 06:51.190
Perfect.

06:51.440 --> 06:55.460
OK so at this point I'm happy with my change I want to save my change.

06:55.460 --> 07:02.600
So over on the right hand corner of the screen I want to click this blue update button all right my

07:02.600 --> 07:08.720
changes were successfully saved and now if we jump back to the public facing Web site that anyone in

07:08.720 --> 07:16.130
the world can see if I refreshed this about us page there we see a new sentence.

07:16.130 --> 07:19.590
All right let's give ourselves another example task.

07:19.620 --> 07:26.760
So for example over on the Travel page of my web site let's imagine that we are not happy with the intro

07:26.760 --> 07:34.070
paragraph for the trip to the west coast story so maybe we want to make it edit to this text.

07:34.080 --> 07:39.390
Now you might think that our first step is to head back over to the administrator dashboard of Wordpress

07:39.870 --> 07:46.860
and click on pages in the sidebar but you'll notice that trip to the west coast is nowhere to be seen

07:46.870 --> 07:48.550
in this list of pages.

07:48.910 --> 07:55.240
And that's because the trip to the west coast story is not a page it is a post.

07:55.270 --> 07:57.930
So what's the difference between a page and a post.

07:58.120 --> 08:01.670
Well I will explain the difference in about 10 seconds from now.

08:01.810 --> 08:07.180
But first I just want to say that you don't need to worry about memorizing the difference right now

08:07.270 --> 08:12.850
in this lesson because this is a topic that we will revisit again and again throughout the course.

08:12.850 --> 08:18.060
But for now I will say that a page is an independent entity.

08:18.160 --> 08:24.550
It's something that can stand on its own right so we saw an example of that in the About Us page whereas

08:24.820 --> 08:28.830
a post is part of a collection of multiple posts.

08:28.900 --> 08:35.390
So in this instance the West Coast trip story is a part of a collection of travel related posts.

08:35.680 --> 08:41.530
And if we want to make changes to it we can just look in the left hand sidebar menu of the Wordpress

08:41.590 --> 08:46.730
administrator dashboard and click on this menu item named posts.

08:48.120 --> 08:51.610
All right here we see a list of all of the posts on the website.

08:51.690 --> 08:57.460
Greek salad homemade french bread easy spaghetti trip to the Midwest a trip to the west coast.

08:57.690 --> 09:00.310
This is the one I want to edit so I click it.

09:00.690 --> 09:06.120
Lets imagine I want to add a new sentence after this first sentence so I just place my cursor here.

09:06.450 --> 09:12.640
The trip lasted three days and was wonderful.

09:12.690 --> 09:14.120
I'm happy with that change.

09:14.160 --> 09:19.650
So then I would click this blue update button on the right hand side of the screen but before I do that

09:19.860 --> 09:23.710
I want to point out a little something about this category's menu.

09:24.030 --> 09:29.970
This trip to the west coast story shows up under travel on my website because that's the category that

09:29.970 --> 09:31.270
we've assigned it.

09:31.290 --> 09:36.080
If instead we wanted the story to live under recipe's we could just check that box.

09:36.210 --> 09:39.370
OK but obviously I want to leave it categorized under travel.

09:39.390 --> 09:42.190
So let's change that scroll back up click update.

09:43.590 --> 09:44.980
All right my changes were saved.

09:44.980 --> 09:51.090
Now if I switch back to the public facing view of my web site and refresh remember I'm currently on

09:51.090 --> 09:53.130
the Travel page of my site.

09:53.480 --> 09:57.650
If we scroll back down to the west coast story here is the new sentence.

09:57.720 --> 09:59.040
Perfect.

09:59.040 --> 10:06.180
Now believe it or not over the last ten minutes you've just learned about 90 percent of Wordpress pages

10:06.180 --> 10:09.790
and posts are the heart and soul of Wordpress websites.

10:09.810 --> 10:11.230
It's really that simple.

10:11.250 --> 10:16.320
Now before we bring this lesson to a close here's a review of the key points that I want you to walk

10:16.320 --> 10:18.000
away with from this video.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.500
I have four main points.

10:19.500 --> 10:25.830
Number one we have the public facing portion of the Web site that the entire world can see.

10:25.830 --> 10:31.500
Number two we have the administrator dashboard screens that only the owner of the website has access

10:31.500 --> 10:32.170
to.

10:32.520 --> 10:34.130
And that's where they manage the web.

10:34.140 --> 10:40.950
From number three we have pages and we have posts and our fourth and final point is one that I didn't

10:40.950 --> 10:42.900
verbalize until right now.

10:42.990 --> 10:48.900
But you may have picked up on it subconsciously and that is that in wordpress there's a separation between

10:48.900 --> 10:51.310
content and presentation.

10:51.540 --> 10:52.830
So what does that phrase mean.

10:52.830 --> 10:55.330
Separating our content from our presentation.

10:55.500 --> 10:57.450
Well let's define our terms.

10:57.720 --> 11:03.960
So content in this context refers to the titles of our pages and posts and to the actual paragraphs

11:03.960 --> 11:05.010
of text.

11:05.220 --> 11:05.490
Right.

11:05.490 --> 11:12.110
So content refers to our raw data presentation refers to the design of our Web site.

11:12.390 --> 11:18.840
So the colors the spacing the layout the fonts typography the header the footer you get the point.

11:18.870 --> 11:23.120
Presentation refers to design or stylistic choices.

11:23.160 --> 11:27.350
Now in this lesson we only saw examples of how to edit content.

11:27.480 --> 11:29.940
We did not learn how to edit presentation.

11:30.090 --> 11:34.250
Don't worry you can definitely edit the presentation of Wordpress websites.

11:34.380 --> 11:37.270
You are not locked into this design or theme.

11:37.350 --> 11:42.510
We all learn how to change our presentation later on in the course but I did want to mention that concept

11:42.510 --> 11:48.480
of separating content from presentation as early in the Course as possible because it's a big part of

11:48.480 --> 11:54.780
what makes WordPress so powerful and flexible and it's an idea that we'll circle back to many times

11:54.780 --> 11:56.140
in the course.

11:56.160 --> 12:00.190
All right that's going to do it for this lesson in our next lesson.

12:00.240 --> 12:04.550
You'll learn how to create your very own new WordPress Web site.

12:04.560 --> 12:10.030
It will start out as a completely empty blank canvas but you'll be the administrator of it.

12:10.200 --> 12:12.780
It'll be your blank canvas to work with.

12:12.810 --> 12:19.530
Also I will be hitting the metaphorical reset button and I'll start with a brand new MT WordPress website

12:19.590 --> 12:24.200
as well so that way you and I can move forward together step by step.

12:24.240 --> 12:28.130
I'm excited to start rolling along and seeing what you'll create with wordpress.

12:28.170 --> 12:31.200
Let's keep things moving and I'll see you in the next lesson.
