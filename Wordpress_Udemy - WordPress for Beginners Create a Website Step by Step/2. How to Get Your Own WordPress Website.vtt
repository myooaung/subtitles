00:00.770 --> 00:07.490
Hello everyone in this lesson we will answer the question how do I get my own board press.

00:07.490 --> 00:07.790
Right.

00:07.790 --> 00:13.910
So how do I get my own public facing web site and how do I get my own administrator dashboard.

00:14.120 --> 00:21.890
Well there are two main ways to get started with Wordpress and it all boils down to two Web sites WordPress

00:21.890 --> 00:26.290
dot com and wordpress dot org.

00:26.300 --> 00:28.860
Now they each have their own pros and cons.

00:28.940 --> 00:30.840
So let me go over those right now.

00:30.860 --> 00:32.940
Let's start with wordpress dot com.

00:32.990 --> 00:37.540
The pros of Wordpress dot com is that it's very easy to get started.

00:37.730 --> 00:41.080
You simply visit WordPress dot com and you sign up for an account.

00:41.240 --> 00:45.770
So it's really similar to signing up for a new email account with Google or Gmail or it's like signing

00:45.770 --> 00:47.870
up for a new account at Facebook.

00:47.870 --> 00:50.030
It's super intuitive super simple.

00:50.030 --> 00:52.640
Now they do offer different types of accounts or plans.

00:52.670 --> 00:58.570
So some of the plans cost a monthly fee but they also have a free plan to get you started.

00:58.730 --> 01:00.820
And there's no time limit for the free plan.

01:00.860 --> 01:02.980
It will remain free forever.

01:03.200 --> 01:07.840
All right changing gears let's talk about the cons of Wordpress dotcom.

01:07.850 --> 01:11.690
So number one you are not in complete control of your web site.

01:11.870 --> 01:18.070
Your web site lives on the Wordpress dot com servers and this means you are really at their mercy.

01:18.080 --> 01:23.990
This means they limit which plugins you can use they limit which themes you can use.

01:23.990 --> 01:29.090
Now I realize at this point in the course we haven't even covered what a plug in or theme is but you

01:29.090 --> 01:31.410
can imagine that you don't want to be limited.

01:31.490 --> 01:32.860
That's never a good thing.

01:33.080 --> 01:39.110
So the general idea is that you can only customize the parts of your website that WordPress dot com

01:39.440 --> 01:41.760
allows you to customize.

01:41.900 --> 01:46.580
Now depending on your business or depending on what you want to achieve with your Web site this might

01:46.580 --> 01:51.800
not bother you if you just want to create a simple blog and be able to write and share your writing

01:51.800 --> 01:53.340
with the entire world.

01:53.420 --> 01:56.860
WordPress dot com can be an amazing service.

01:56.860 --> 02:03.160
However WordPress dot com is clearly not for everyone because it is very restrictive or limiting.

02:03.320 --> 02:08.710
So now let's really change gears and talk about WordPress dot org.

02:08.960 --> 02:10.730
Let's go over the pros and cons.

02:10.730 --> 02:12.260
We'll start with the pros.

02:12.260 --> 02:16.620
Number one this is the full WordPress experience.

02:16.700 --> 02:24.020
This is what people think of when they think of Wordpress with Wordpress or you are in 100 percent complete

02:24.020 --> 02:25.670
control of your website.

02:25.730 --> 02:28.240
You are the owner of your website.

02:28.370 --> 02:30.410
You can customize anything you want.

02:30.410 --> 02:35.540
You can use any plugin you can use any theme again at this stage in the course we don't really know

02:35.540 --> 02:41.270
what those words mean plug in and theme but you can imagine that the freedom to use whatever you want

02:41.360 --> 02:42.410
is a good thing.

02:42.590 --> 02:46.620
With wordpress org you're also free to monetize your Web site.

02:46.640 --> 02:50.970
That means you can run ads or sell products so on and so forth.

02:51.170 --> 02:53.690
And the final pro and this is not necessary.

02:53.690 --> 02:55.420
You don't ever need to learn how to code.

02:55.430 --> 03:01.140
If you don't want to but if in the future you decide you want to learn how to code with wordpress.

03:01.190 --> 03:06.230
Or you're free to customize the code of every single aspect of your website.

03:06.320 --> 03:09.340
So in a nutshell Wordpress or is amazing.

03:09.470 --> 03:12.760
It's personally what I use for my web sites now.

03:12.770 --> 03:18.380
I haven't even gotten to the cons of Wordpress dot org yet and I can already tell you that this is what

03:18.380 --> 03:20.440
we're going to use in the course.

03:20.480 --> 03:26.270
Now you are free to use Wordpress dot com with the advice to outside of this course but for the purposes

03:26.270 --> 03:28.850
of learning as much as possible in this course.

03:28.880 --> 03:33.920
I encourage you to follow along with me and give WordPress dot org a try.

03:33.920 --> 03:35.960
Now let's talk about the cons.

03:35.960 --> 03:42.980
There's really only one con to WordPress dot org and that is that you need to find your own web hosting.

03:43.010 --> 03:43.610
What does that mean.

03:43.610 --> 03:44.650
What is web hosting.

03:44.720 --> 03:50.900
Well remember when I said that with wordpress dot com your web site lives on their servers and this

03:50.900 --> 03:56.560
is what allows them to limit or restrict what you can do with wordpress dot org.

03:56.600 --> 04:02.270
Your web site will live on whatever web host company you choose and there are hundreds of thousands

04:02.270 --> 04:08.330
of web host companies to choose from a web host is just a company that leaves their computers or servers

04:08.330 --> 04:16.190
on 24 hours a day 365 days a year and your web site lives on their servers so that way your web site

04:16.220 --> 04:19.070
is accessible to the world around the clock.

04:19.100 --> 04:22.240
Now any web host worth using costs money.

04:22.460 --> 04:27.590
But don't worry I want you to be able to work through this course without spending an extra penny.

04:27.590 --> 04:31.090
So I've partnered with a web host so you can get started for free.

04:31.250 --> 04:34.520
You won't even need to enter a credit card or any form of payment.

04:34.520 --> 04:36.930
We'll talk more about that in just a few minutes.

04:37.040 --> 04:43.490
But anyways with web hosts you typically pay a monthly or yearly amount and in return they host your

04:43.490 --> 04:44.700
Web site for you.

04:44.930 --> 04:50.150
Generally speaking you get what you pay for meaning the more expensive the web host the faster your

04:50.150 --> 04:52.130
site will load for your visitors.

04:52.130 --> 04:57.530
Now like I said there are tons of web hosting companies to choose from and it can be difficult to know

04:57.530 --> 04:58.570
where to begin.

04:58.580 --> 05:00.250
Which companies should we use.

05:00.460 --> 05:07.570
Well if we open up our web browser and go to the official WordPress dot org Web site we see that up

05:07.570 --> 05:08.280
in the header.

05:08.280 --> 05:16.460
Within this main navigation bar towards the right hand side there's a link named hosting over the years

05:16.480 --> 05:21.750
the Wordpress team has paid attention to which hosting companies treat their customers the best and

05:21.750 --> 05:24.240
make working with wordpress a breeze.

05:24.250 --> 05:29.020
Now you don't have to use one of these companies but these are among the best.

05:29.020 --> 05:36.040
So we see blue host dream host flywheel and site ground.

05:36.040 --> 05:42.400
Now normally it costs money to sign up with one of these web hosts but I've partnered with site ground

05:42.400 --> 05:48.250
for this course and thanks to that partnership you can get started with your own hosting and wordpress

05:48.250 --> 05:50.930
site without spending another penny.

05:51.070 --> 05:56.170
Now I don't want you to feel like you have to use site ground if you want to google and do your own

05:56.170 --> 05:58.980
research and choose a hosting company on your own.

05:58.990 --> 06:05.230
More kudos to you but as the teacher of this course I want to provide a clear example path that anyone

06:05.230 --> 06:06.130
can follow.

06:06.310 --> 06:06.700
All right.

06:06.700 --> 06:07.990
So let's get started.

06:08.170 --> 06:20.830
As a student in this course you are free to visit the following URL learn web code dot com slash student

06:21.070 --> 06:29.550
dash Costain so learn web code dot com is my web site and then the slash student hosting will take us

06:29.550 --> 06:30.570
to the free site.

06:30.570 --> 06:31.710
Ground Seiner.

06:31.950 --> 06:41.480
So if I push enter to visit this you are l we see special deal for learn web code students create your

06:41.480 --> 06:42.550
Web site now.

06:42.560 --> 06:45.250
So I'm going to click the sign out button.

06:47.470 --> 06:54.440
Just enter your e-mail address and make up a password then just fill in a bit of basic contact info.

06:54.440 --> 06:56.980
So basically your name and your address.

06:56.990 --> 07:00.470
Scroll down a bit further within this box.

07:00.500 --> 07:03.640
Three months is the only available option.

07:03.920 --> 07:07.710
And again it's not like at the end of three months they can automatically believe you.

07:07.730 --> 07:10.860
They can't because we aren't even entering a credit card.

07:11.090 --> 07:16.700
So we see zero dollars and zero cents and if we scroll down a bit further make sure this box is checked

07:17.150 --> 07:19.810
and the submit button reads pain now.

07:20.030 --> 07:23.900
But obviously our grand total is zero dollars and zero cents.

07:24.050 --> 07:25.340
So you're not actually paying.

07:25.340 --> 07:27.380
So go ahead and click the pay now button.

07:27.800 --> 07:30.800
And that should take you to this success screen.

07:30.800 --> 07:36.530
Now it may take five seconds or may take ten minutes but very soon you should receive an e-mail from

07:36.530 --> 07:37.650
site ground.

07:37.850 --> 07:45.290
In that e-mail look for a button or link that reads log in to customer area or you can simply hover

07:45.290 --> 07:51.980
over this button in the top right that reads log in and you can enter your email and password right

07:51.980 --> 07:52.590
here.

07:52.790 --> 07:58.820
Or if you actually click right about here that will take you to the dedicated logging page.

07:58.810 --> 08:00.660
It doesn't matter how you log in.

08:00.830 --> 08:01.130
OK.

08:01.130 --> 08:03.820
So go ahead and type in your e-mail and your password.

08:03.830 --> 08:11.160
And then click sign that should take you to this page for this first option of set up your website.

08:11.270 --> 08:18.090
Let's choose the option of start a new Web site and then from these available options.

08:18.140 --> 08:22.090
Obviously we're interested in the first one WordPress.

08:22.310 --> 08:29.070
So click that let me scroll down a bit within this section we are going to create the administrator

08:29.070 --> 08:30.880
user for WordPress.

08:31.020 --> 08:31.340
Right.

08:31.350 --> 08:36.860
So this will be the account that has access to the Wordpress administrator dashboard screens.

08:36.930 --> 08:40.390
So enter your email address and a username.

08:40.530 --> 08:42.020
Here's a quick security tip.

08:42.030 --> 08:47.730
Instead of using a user name of the admin choose something that's a bit more difficult for other people

08:47.730 --> 08:49.020
to guess.

08:49.050 --> 08:56.990
So maybe my secret admin or something along those lines and then make up another password here.

08:57.330 --> 09:03.340
And before you click this confirm button double check that you spelled your email address correctly.

09:03.600 --> 09:06.290
OK so when you're all set click the confirm button.

09:08.300 --> 09:13.790
Which will take us to the next screen and from here we just want to check this checkbox that says we

09:13.790 --> 09:19.560
agree to the terms of service and then we can click on complete set up.

09:19.580 --> 09:25.490
Now it might take five seconds or five minutes but once the screen appears then go ahead and click on

09:25.760 --> 09:29.200
proceed to customer area.

09:29.210 --> 09:32.890
All right now this is our site Ground dash board.

09:33.230 --> 09:37.420
But we're interested in our WordPress admin dashboard.

09:37.760 --> 09:44.890
So up towards the top here click on my accounts and then right here I see the Web site that I just set

09:44.890 --> 09:49.060
up about a minute ago you will have a different you are all right here.

09:49.180 --> 09:52.300
Probably your first name and then the first letter of your last name.

09:52.300 --> 09:59.050
So go ahead and click on that and this is your very own WordPress website.

09:59.050 --> 10:04.480
All right so you could share this you RL with anyone in the world and they would be able to see this

10:04.480 --> 10:05.760
Web site.

10:05.800 --> 10:06.190
All right.

10:06.190 --> 10:12.100
But if this is your Web site you want to be able to log in as the administrator so you can edit and

10:12.100 --> 10:19.330
change and customize your website up in the address bar at the end of your you Arel out on a forward

10:19.330 --> 10:27.000
slash and then W.P. dash logging in dot ph p.

10:27.490 --> 10:30.530
And again this part of your you are will be different.

10:30.610 --> 10:36.670
So press enter and then just add the Wordpress admin username and password.

10:36.700 --> 10:43.660
Remember this is the user name where I told you to maybe use something like my secret admin or something

10:43.660 --> 10:45.050
along those lines.

10:45.250 --> 10:48.280
So go ahead and type in your username and password right now.

10:48.400 --> 10:55.070
Click log in and if you're using the free site Ground account you'll see a screen that looks like this.

10:55.120 --> 11:00.030
You will not see the screen if you are using any other web hosting company.

11:00.040 --> 11:05.530
This is a Quickstart Guide that the site Ground company created to try and make the process of creating

11:05.530 --> 11:08.020
a WordPress Web site a bit easier.

11:08.020 --> 11:11.820
However this Quickstart Guide is not necessary.

11:11.860 --> 11:18.490
You're free to use it if you want to but I recommend just scrolling down to the bottom and clicking

11:18.490 --> 11:20.740
on the exit link.

11:20.830 --> 11:24.090
If you do want to use this Quickstart Guide and you click Start now.

11:24.100 --> 11:27.540
Nothing bad will happen and the default choices are great.

11:27.550 --> 11:28.820
They won't hurt anything.

11:29.020 --> 11:34.870
I just think the steps are necessary so I recommend clicking exit OK.

11:34.880 --> 11:40.000
Now again if you're using site ground like I am you'll see a screen that looks like this.

11:40.040 --> 11:46.980
If you're using any other web host your Wordpress admin dashboard will not look exactly like this.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
That's OK.

11:48.230 --> 11:54.100
In fact if you are using site ground like I am I actually encourage you to do the following.

11:54.290 --> 11:55.840
We can go ahead and click this.

11:55.910 --> 12:01.910
Don't show this again message here because we don't really need the site Ground Quickstart Guide.

12:02.090 --> 12:05.540
It's not a part of the official WordPress software.

12:05.540 --> 12:11.480
This is basically just a message from our web hosting company site ground trying to make our lives easier.

12:11.570 --> 12:16.910
So I'd recommend clicking don't show this again and then finally if you're using site ground on our

12:16.910 --> 12:23.690
dashboard here I recommend scrolling down to the very bottom and down here we see the sentence that

12:23.690 --> 12:25.460
reads If you wish.

12:25.460 --> 12:29.150
You can always switch to the default dashboard.

12:29.150 --> 12:34.640
So basically what's going on here is that the site Ground web hosting company is trying to give us a

12:34.640 --> 12:37.820
dashboard that makes our lives easier.

12:37.820 --> 12:42.350
The issue is that this is not the official WordPress dashboard.

12:42.440 --> 12:47.960
So for the sake of having everyone in this course be on the same page I recommend to scroll down to

12:47.960 --> 12:53.610
the bottom here and if you're using site ground you can just click switch to default.

12:53.750 --> 12:59.660
You'll notice as soon as I do this my admin dashboard looks a bit different and that's OK.

12:59.690 --> 13:04.740
This is the official WordPress dashboard and this is what I want you to get used to.

13:05.000 --> 13:09.020
Here I can see that the site Ground optimizer is trying to show me a message.

13:09.110 --> 13:10.350
This is not important.

13:10.370 --> 13:14.960
I can go ahead and click this X towards the right hand side to hide that message.

13:15.380 --> 13:21.240
Also I see this note here about personal data and privacy towards the bottom right hand corner of this

13:21.260 --> 13:29.800
little message I can just click dismiss and congratulations this is your admin dashboard area and from

13:29.800 --> 13:35.200
here you can customize your website which is what we'll be learning how to do in depth throughout this

13:35.200 --> 13:36.750
entire course.

13:36.760 --> 13:40.960
Now I do want to point out that web hosting companies are not charities.

13:41.080 --> 13:47.620
The hard drive space and bandwidth we use even on our experimental Web sites like this cost hosting

13:47.620 --> 13:48.990
companies money.

13:49.030 --> 13:53.680
So let me talk a little about how this free site Ground student account works.

13:53.710 --> 13:58.990
First you'll notice that you did not get your own custom dot com domain.

13:58.990 --> 14:05.250
So for now the URL of your web site is simply your name and then as GED you does site.

14:05.470 --> 14:12.270
Secondly as we saw on the sign up screen this student account will only last for three months.

14:12.310 --> 14:14.770
Now we won't get Bill that the end of three months.

14:14.770 --> 14:19.940
Remember we didn't even enter a credit card but I do want you to be aware of that time limit.

14:20.080 --> 14:25.800
Now three months is more than enough time to learn how to use Wordpress and create a great Web site.

14:26.050 --> 14:31.010
And that's the entire point of this course to learn the ins and outs of WordPress.

14:31.030 --> 14:35.350
If by the end of this course you're really happy with the Web site you create and you want it to be

14:35.350 --> 14:42.460
tied to a real custom your name dot com domain and you want it to live forever instead of 3 months.

14:42.520 --> 14:47.410
That's going to cost a bit of money and in the name of transparency I do want to say that if you decide

14:47.410 --> 14:50.980
to sign up with site ground it won't cost you anything extra.

14:51.000 --> 14:56.450
