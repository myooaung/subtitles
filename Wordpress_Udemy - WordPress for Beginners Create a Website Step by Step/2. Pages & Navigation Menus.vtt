00:00.830 --> 00:07.580
Hello everyone in this lesson we will begin learning about pages in our previous lesson.

00:07.580 --> 00:12.710
We created a few posts and in this lesson we will create a few pages.

00:12.950 --> 00:15.070
Let's begin with the important question.

00:15.110 --> 00:18.620
What is the difference between a post and a page.

00:18.920 --> 00:21.490
Well a page is exactly what it sounds like.

00:21.500 --> 00:23.450
It's a page on our website.

00:23.690 --> 00:31.070
For example that could be an about us page or a Contact Us page or a photo gallery page a page is meant

00:31.070 --> 00:33.190
to be its own independent entity.

00:33.200 --> 00:40.010
It can stand alone and you would typically have links to pages in the navigation area towards the top

00:40.010 --> 00:41.020
of your website.

00:41.360 --> 00:49.640
Also a page usually is not time sensitive like a blog post might be on the front end public facing portion

00:49.640 --> 00:50.700
of our website.

00:50.720 --> 00:56.960
We don't usually display the date that a page was created like we do with blog posts so we might say

00:56.960 --> 01:01.040
that a page is an example of evergreen content.

01:01.040 --> 01:08.360
A page is timeless and we can contrast all of this with a post right because we know that a post is

01:08.360 --> 01:09.870
a part of a collection.

01:09.980 --> 01:17.930
A blog page shows multiple posts at once and a post is time sensitive that a blog page will be sorted

01:17.930 --> 01:20.310
with the newest posts on top.

01:20.370 --> 01:25.670
Now if everything I just said didn't make any sense that's OK because the best way to learn about pages

01:25.670 --> 01:32.360
vs posts is not to listen to an explanation but to simply go and create a few pages in wordpress.

01:32.360 --> 01:34.370
So let's do that right now.

01:34.370 --> 01:35.000
All right.

01:35.000 --> 01:42.800
So here I am on the admin dashboard of my web site and let's create a few pages in case you've forgotten

01:42.800 --> 01:45.890
how to navigate to this admin screen.

01:45.890 --> 01:51.530
Remember that you are able to get here is simply the base or route part of your you RL.

01:51.560 --> 01:56.180
So the part that I'm highlighting and that will be slightly different for your web site.

01:56.570 --> 02:04.020
But then after the root of your you are l just out on a slash and then W P add men.

02:04.490 --> 02:09.540
OK so once you log in you'll be taken to an admin screen that looks similar to this.

02:09.710 --> 02:14.210
And our goal right now is to create a few new pages.

02:14.210 --> 02:22.400
So in this left hand side bar a few links down from the top here we see an option named pages and when

02:22.400 --> 02:30.850
I hover over it noticed this menu appears and I'm interested in the add new option so on this screen

02:30.880 --> 02:33.260
we are creating a brand new page.

02:33.280 --> 02:36.580
Let's begin by giving this page a title.

02:36.580 --> 02:42.280
So in this first field let's call this new page about us.

02:42.370 --> 02:46.240
You're free to use whatever title you want but this is what I'm going to use.

02:46.450 --> 02:49.170
And then down in the main content field.

02:49.270 --> 02:58.960
For now let's just add a bit of placeholder content so this page will contain real about us related

02:58.960 --> 03:01.000
content very soon.

03:01.480 --> 03:02.440
You get the idea.

03:02.500 --> 03:06.170
We can fill in this area with more content in the future.

03:06.430 --> 03:10.210
But for now let's just go ahead and create this new page.

03:10.210 --> 03:15.870
So over on the right hand side of the screen lets use this blue publish button.

03:15.910 --> 03:19.420
OK so we just successfully created a new page.

03:19.660 --> 03:25.210
But you'll notice that if we jump over to the public facing portion of our Web site so if we use this

03:25.210 --> 03:31.360
link towards the top left the link with the home icon if we click that this is our home page.

03:31.360 --> 03:34.130
This is what the general public sees.

03:34.150 --> 03:38.470
You'll notice that there's no link to that new about us page.

03:38.470 --> 03:45.070
Clearly that's a problem right because how can we expect the visitors of our website to ever find the

03:45.070 --> 03:46.520
about us page.

03:46.720 --> 03:53.200
If there isn't a prominently displayed link to it now in about 60 seconds from now I will show you how

03:53.200 --> 03:58.900
to create navigation links so we will learn how to create links towards the top of our Web site right

03:58.900 --> 04:01.710
about here that link to different pages.

04:01.750 --> 04:07.810
But before we do that why don't we go back into the admin area and create a second page so that way

04:07.810 --> 04:15.640
we have multiple pages to experiment with so I can use this link to go back to my admin area and let's

04:15.640 --> 04:17.070
create another page.

04:17.080 --> 04:25.090
So if I hover over pages and click add new just a moment ago we created an about us page.

04:25.090 --> 04:31.620
Why don't we now create a contact us page and again in the content area.

04:31.630 --> 04:43.270
I will just type this page will contain real contact related content very soon.

04:43.690 --> 04:47.940
OK so we will update this later but for now let's publish this page.

04:50.120 --> 04:52.270
Ok and now we have two pages.

04:52.280 --> 04:59.960
We have about us and contact us and if we jump over to our public Web site the question still remains

05:00.320 --> 05:02.620
if we don't have links to those pages.

05:02.630 --> 05:06.270
How are the visitors of our Web site ever supposed to find them.

05:06.290 --> 05:09.380
Now the solution here is to add a navigation menu.

05:09.410 --> 05:16.280
Maybe right about here that includes links to our various pages and luckily WordPress makes it fairly

05:16.280 --> 05:18.920
simple to create a navigation menu.

05:19.010 --> 05:20.190
So check this out.

05:20.480 --> 05:27.710
Let's use this link to jump back to our admin area and if we want to create a navigation menu Let me

05:27.710 --> 05:31.180
show you where you would look in this left hand side bar.

05:31.340 --> 05:37.880
Look for the item named appearance and then when you hover over appearance these extra options should

05:37.880 --> 05:42.410
appear and we're interested in the menus link.

05:42.440 --> 05:49.610
So go ahead and click on menus and now on this screen since our website is brand new it doesn't contain

05:49.640 --> 05:51.620
any menus at the moment.

05:51.620 --> 05:57.050
So our first step is to create a new menu in this field right here.

05:57.080 --> 06:00.030
You just click and then give the menu a name.

06:00.050 --> 06:05.750
It doesn't really matter what you name the menu the visitors of your website usually will not see this

06:05.750 --> 06:10.670
menu name really the name is just for your own organization purposes.

06:10.880 --> 06:17.690
So for example I will name my menu main menu but you can name it whatever you want then go ahead and

06:17.690 --> 06:20.470
click the blue create menu button.

06:22.000 --> 06:26.500
And now it's just a matter of adding different pages and links to our menu.

06:26.500 --> 06:32.050
So for example right about here we see a list of all of the pages that we've created so far.

06:32.170 --> 06:38.530
And if I want to add a link to the About Us page in our menu I can just check this box next to about

06:38.530 --> 06:43.720
us and then click this add menu button OK.

06:43.750 --> 06:47.130
So this area is basically a preview of our menu.

06:47.280 --> 06:52.750
So currently the menu only contains this one linked to about us and if we also want to add.

06:52.750 --> 06:55.240
Contact us over in this area.

06:55.240 --> 06:58.400
Obviously we would just check the box for contact us.

06:58.420 --> 07:03.410
We could have checked it just a moment ago so you can check multiple pages at once you get the idea.

07:03.670 --> 07:04.480
But we just want to add.

07:04.480 --> 07:08.950
Contact us and then click add to Menu OK.

07:08.950 --> 07:11.800
So now our menu contains these two links.

07:11.890 --> 07:14.230
We will add more pages and links in the future.

07:14.230 --> 07:15.820
But for now this looks good.

07:15.940 --> 07:20.100
And now our final step is to choose where on the page.

07:20.110 --> 07:22.090
This menu should be displayed.

07:22.270 --> 07:27.790
Basically we need to decide do we want this navigation menu to be up at the top of the page in our header

07:28.060 --> 07:32.650
or do we want to be down at the bottom of the page in the footer or do we want it to be in the side

07:32.650 --> 07:33.280
bar.

07:33.400 --> 07:39.190
So you'll notice that down here we have an area named display location with three options to choose

07:39.190 --> 07:39.950
from.

07:40.120 --> 07:44.120
Later in the course we will learn how to have more options here to choose from.

07:44.320 --> 07:46.540
But for now the choice is pretty simple.

07:46.570 --> 07:51.190
I think it's best for navigation menus towards the top of the Web site near the header.

07:51.340 --> 07:54.230
So I will check this box that reads primary.

07:54.430 --> 07:55.780
OK so now we're good to go.

07:55.780 --> 07:58.290
I'm going to click this blue save menu button.

07:58.280 --> 08:01.060
There's also a copy of that button up here.

08:01.060 --> 08:03.460
Click either one save menu.

08:03.670 --> 08:06.610
And now let's jump over to our public Web site.

08:07.180 --> 08:11.070
And good news right below the header we see this navigation menu.

08:11.080 --> 08:16.930
So right now we're on the home page but if I click on this about us link that takes me to the About

08:16.930 --> 08:20.110
Us page remember here is that placeholder content.

08:20.110 --> 08:24.460
This page will contain real about us related content very soon.

08:24.460 --> 08:31.150
Check out that you are Albar right so it took us to slash about us and back in the navigation menu if

08:31.150 --> 08:32.990
we click on Contact Us.

08:33.010 --> 08:36.620
Obviously that takes us to the Contact Us page.

08:36.780 --> 08:37.240
OK.

08:37.240 --> 08:39.730
And then you can always click on the name of your web site.

08:39.730 --> 08:43.330
So this heading to go back to your home page and there you have it.

08:43.330 --> 08:45.490
So we have a mini web site at this point right.

08:45.490 --> 08:52.000
We have a home page and we have a navigation bar where visitors can switch between our various pages.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.440
Now practice makes perfect.

08:53.440 --> 09:00.310
So before we end this lesson why don't we try to create another new page and then add it to our navigation

09:00.310 --> 09:00.970
menu.

09:01.180 --> 09:07.950
So let's use this link to go back to the admin area to create a new page I will hover over pages and

09:07.960 --> 09:10.210
click add new.

09:10.390 --> 09:13.600
You can create whatever new page you want and name it whatever you want.

09:13.600 --> 09:22.120
But I'm going to call this page photo gallery and then down here I will say photo gallery content will

09:22.150 --> 09:25.570
live on this page very soon.

09:25.570 --> 09:33.340
Looks good so I will click this publish button ok so I just created a new page and now the next step

09:33.340 --> 09:36.300
is to add it to the navigation menu.

09:36.340 --> 09:40.930
So remember when you want to deal with menus look in the sidebar for appearance.

09:40.930 --> 09:41.860
Here it is.

09:42.100 --> 09:47.430
And then out of all of these appearance options we want menus.

09:47.490 --> 09:51.490
OK so here's what our menu currently contains just these two links.

09:51.740 --> 09:54.790
And here is a list of all of our available pages.

09:54.980 --> 10:00.520
So obviously I want to add the photo gallery page so check the check box and then just click add to

10:00.530 --> 10:06.340
menu and maybe I don't want the photo gallery link to be the last link in the menu.

10:06.380 --> 10:11.160
Maybe I want it to be second so maybe I want to come before contact us.

10:11.360 --> 10:17.620
Well reordering the links is super easy you can just click and drag so you can drag it wherever you

10:17.620 --> 10:18.030
want.

10:18.100 --> 10:24.850
So I want it to be there and then just click the blue save menu button again and now if we switch back

10:24.850 --> 10:28.510
over to our public Web site here we see the navigation.

10:28.510 --> 10:32.050
And more importantly here we see our new photo gallery link.

10:32.350 --> 10:33.450
Perfect.

10:33.550 --> 10:37.180
And that's actually going to bring this lesson to a close.

10:37.180 --> 10:42.970
Now in future lessons we will learn a lot more about pages so that we will be able to actually build

10:42.970 --> 10:49.750
out the real content for the About Us page and for the photo gallery page and for the Contact Us page.

10:49.920 --> 10:50.220
OK.

10:50.230 --> 10:53.810
So don't worry we won't have this placeholder content forever.

10:53.950 --> 10:58.930
But before we get to that and build up the real content there's something even more important I want

10:58.930 --> 11:00.170
to cover first.

11:00.340 --> 11:05.100
I want to show you how to customize the overall appearance of your website.

11:05.290 --> 11:12.850
So for example what if you wanted the margins of your website to be wider or narrower or what if you

11:12.850 --> 11:18.160
want to use different colors for the text and the links or what if you want to use a different background

11:18.160 --> 11:21.030
color instead of white you get the idea.

11:21.190 --> 11:27.160
Now when we talk about the visual appearance the stylistic appearance of our WordPress website what

11:27.160 --> 11:31.570
we are really talking about is the theme of our Web site.

11:31.720 --> 11:38.650
That's a word you are going to hear over and over again in the Wordpress universe theme and in our very

11:38.650 --> 11:45.880
next lesson we will get our first taste of what the theme is we will learn how to switch to a different

11:45.880 --> 11:51.940
theme and we will also learn how to customize the appearance settings of the current theme that we have

11:51.940 --> 11:52.690
chosen.

11:52.900 --> 11:54.130
It's going to be a ton of fun.

11:54.130 --> 11:56.940
This is where you really get to customize your Web site.

11:57.190 --> 12:01.390
So let's keep things rolling and I'll see you in the next lesson.
