00:00.810 --> 00:05.780
Hello everyone in this lesson we will learn about themes.

00:06.090 --> 00:07.520
Let's begin with a question.

00:07.560 --> 00:10.140
So what is a theme.

00:10.320 --> 00:15.150
A theme is what controls the design or appearance of your website.

00:15.510 --> 00:22.350
So a theme is what controls things like the fonts being used the colors being used and the page layout.

00:22.350 --> 00:22.610
Right.

00:22.610 --> 00:25.470
So how many columns there are things like that.

00:25.470 --> 00:33.090
So big picture when we think of our Web site let's think of two main concepts content and presentation

00:33.180 --> 00:34.740
or appearance.

00:34.740 --> 00:42.690
Now the posts and pages we create those control the actual content of the Web site and the theme controls

00:42.690 --> 00:45.390
the appearance or the design.

00:45.390 --> 00:47.180
All right that's enough talking.

00:47.250 --> 00:53.900
Now let's just jump right into the action so you can visually see with your own eyes an example of what

00:53.900 --> 00:55.740
a theme is.

00:55.770 --> 00:56.420
All right.

00:56.430 --> 00:59.670
So this is what my public web site looks like right now.

00:59.850 --> 01:01.050
But check this out.

01:01.200 --> 01:08.660
If I navigate over to my admin dashboard area by using this link and then if I look in the sidebar for

01:08.660 --> 01:15.590
the appearance option I can either click directly on this main appearance item or I can click on themes

01:15.590 --> 01:18.180
in this pop out menu.

01:18.220 --> 01:25.560
OK so these are the three themes that WordPress comes with out of the box and you can see that this

01:25.560 --> 01:33.010
one 20:19 says active because that's the particular theme that my web site is using.

01:33.150 --> 01:39.120
Now depending on when you're watching this lesson you might not have the exact same three themes here

01:39.630 --> 01:45.270
because the people who create WordPress release a new theme every year.

01:45.300 --> 01:51.300
Long story short you might not have the exact same three themes that I have here but that's OK because

01:51.300 --> 01:54.300
the exact same concepts still apply.

01:54.570 --> 02:01.260
So back to the task at hand if I want to change the way my website looks I can stop using this theme

02:01.260 --> 02:04.460
by activating one of these two themes.

02:04.470 --> 02:14.070
So for example I will hover over this 20:17 theme and then I will go ahead and click this activate button.

02:14.260 --> 02:20.880
And now if I go and check out my public facing web sites if I click this link we can see that my web

02:20.880 --> 02:27.590
site looks completely different now and it's because we switched to a new theme we we're using a new

02:27.590 --> 02:28.390
theme.

02:28.820 --> 02:33.830
And let's imagine that we don't really like this theme and we want to switch to yet another one.

02:34.010 --> 02:41.360
So I will just jump back to my admin dashboard click on appearance in the sidebar and I'm going to try

02:41.360 --> 02:44.490
out the theme named 2016.

02:44.810 --> 02:52.580
So I would just click activate and then jump back to my public facing web site and we can see that new

02:52.580 --> 02:54.430
theme in action.

02:54.430 --> 02:55.890
Now I really like this theme.

02:55.930 --> 03:01.510
It's the one that I'm going to stick with but before I go any further I do want to let you know that

03:01.510 --> 03:06.940
you are not limited to the three themes that WordPress comes with out of the box.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.080
Let me show you what I mean.

03:08.080 --> 03:14.530
So if I go back to my admin area and click on appearance I want to stress that you are not limited to

03:14.530 --> 03:17.070
just the three themes that you see here.

03:17.230 --> 03:21.580
In reality there are thousands of free themes you can choose from.

03:21.760 --> 03:22.570
So check this out.

03:22.600 --> 03:29.890
If we click this large add new theme area down here or if we click add new up here towards the top of

03:29.890 --> 03:37.480
the page if we click on either of those links we are taken to this new page with a ton of new themes

03:37.480 --> 03:38.470
to choose from.

03:39.340 --> 03:45.250
Now if you immediately see one that you like just hover over it and click the blue install button.

03:45.460 --> 03:50.400
But if you scroll through this list of featured themes and you don't see one that you really like.

03:50.410 --> 03:54.510
That's OK because remember there's much more than just these featured ones.

03:54.550 --> 04:00.580
There are thousands to choose from and what you can do is utilize this search menu up in the top right

04:00.580 --> 04:01.430
corner.

04:01.510 --> 04:07.000
So maybe you're looking for a theme that has a dark background or a light background or maybe you want

04:07.000 --> 04:10.250
a blue themed site or green site you get the idea.

04:10.360 --> 04:15.600
Just search for whatever keywords you're interested in whatever kind of theme you're looking for.

04:15.700 --> 04:19.390
Maybe if your business is a restaurant you could even search for that.

04:19.390 --> 04:25.080
Or if you're a photographer you could search for photo gallery or photographer.

04:25.090 --> 04:26.330
You get the idea.

04:26.350 --> 04:33.400
Now before I jump back to the 2016 theme that I really like I want to show you how easy it is to install

04:33.400 --> 04:35.690
and utilize a new theme that you find.

04:35.860 --> 04:40.170
So for example I know that there's a theme named but that I really like.

04:40.180 --> 04:44.460
So if I search for that button it's the first result here.

04:44.650 --> 04:49.370
So once you find a theme you like just hover over it and then click the blue install button.

04:53.320 --> 04:53.740
OK.

04:53.740 --> 04:55.900
And then once the installation completes.

04:55.900 --> 05:03.110
Now you can click activate or if you just click on appearance back in your sidebar that'll take you

05:03.110 --> 05:08.260
back to a screen where you can see only the themes that you actually have installed.

05:08.300 --> 05:11.510
And in my case now we can see that button is included here.

05:11.660 --> 05:17.300
So now I'm free to go ahead and click the Activate button and if I switch back over to my public facing

05:17.300 --> 05:22.190
Web site here we can see that new Butland theme in action.

05:22.420 --> 05:22.800
OK.

05:22.810 --> 05:29.290
Now obviously you are free to use any theme that you would like but for the purposes of this course.

05:29.380 --> 05:31.360
Why don't we stay on the same page.

05:31.480 --> 05:34.110
Why don't we go ahead and use the same theme.

05:34.300 --> 05:42.860
So I really like the 2016 theme so I'm going to jump back to my admin area click on appearance hover

05:42.860 --> 05:47.580
over this 2016 theme and click activate.

05:47.730 --> 05:54.240
Now if you're watching this video in 2018 or 2019 or even beyond that in your word press didn't come

05:54.240 --> 05:55.650
with the 2016 theme.

05:55.680 --> 06:06.930
Out of the box you can always just click on Add new and simply use the search bar to search for 20 16

06:09.990 --> 06:10.420
OK.

06:10.430 --> 06:11.980
And there we see it.

06:12.260 --> 06:15.620
Now again you are free to use any theme that you like.

06:15.620 --> 06:20.560
There are thousands to choose from but every theme is a little bit different.

06:20.720 --> 06:26.600
And even though all themes use the same general concepts when you're just starting out with wordpress

06:26.900 --> 06:31.670
I think it will be easier for you to follow along with me using the same theme as me.

06:31.940 --> 06:36.770
And then once you've worked through the course and you're familiar with the concepts it would be a piece

06:36.770 --> 06:42.290
of cake for you to go through this course a second time where you use a theme of your choice.

06:42.500 --> 06:45.320
So it's totally up to you if you're feeling brave right now.

06:45.320 --> 06:50.610
You don't have to use 2016 but that is the theme that I'm going to use.

06:50.630 --> 06:55.760
So let's jump back to our public facing web site and let's get down to work.

06:55.820 --> 06:59.760
The first thing that I want to address is our navigation menu.

06:59.810 --> 07:05.900
Now if you switched to a new theme and you still successfully see your navigation menu that's great

07:06.350 --> 07:10.090
but if you switch to a theme in your navigation menu disappeared.

07:10.280 --> 07:11.940
I don't want you to panic.

07:11.960 --> 07:16.190
So for example if my navigation menu was not here what would I do.

07:16.190 --> 07:17.800
How could I get it back.

07:17.840 --> 07:18.690
Let me show you.

07:18.920 --> 07:27.270
Let's go back into our admin dashboard and in the sidebar under appearance click on menus and in this

07:27.270 --> 07:33.900
area of the page below the preview of our menu we see display location.

07:34.110 --> 07:40.470
Now because the theme that I was using previously matches the same name as this new theme I'm using

07:40.740 --> 07:43.810
this checkbox was smart enough to stay checked.

07:43.830 --> 07:47.650
Now every theme has different display locations.

07:47.700 --> 07:54.120
For example one theme might let you add the navigation menu to the side bar or down the footer or up

07:54.120 --> 07:55.080
in the header.

07:55.080 --> 07:57.360
So there's different options for each theme.

07:57.540 --> 08:03.780
And if your website no longer displays your navigation menu you just need to come to the screen and

08:03.780 --> 08:10.290
probably choose the option that reads either a primary menu or top menu or head or menu or something

08:10.290 --> 08:11.560
along those lines.

08:11.630 --> 08:14.880
Everything is a bit different but you get the general idea.

08:14.940 --> 08:18.590
So make sure one of them is checked and then click save menu.

08:19.040 --> 08:19.650
OK.

08:19.740 --> 08:26.010
For our next bit of business let's imagine that we don't really like this thick black border around

08:26.070 --> 08:27.890
all four edges of our Web site.

08:28.170 --> 08:33.660
Or maybe instead of the links turning blue when we hover over them and these links in the sidebar being

08:33.660 --> 08:37.600
blue maybe we want to use green or pink or any other color.

08:37.740 --> 08:44.460
Well most themes but not all themes make it very easy to customize basic settings like that.

08:44.460 --> 08:45.270
So check it out.

08:45.420 --> 08:52.290
If we jump over to our admin dashboard area and in the sidebar look for appearance and then look in

08:52.290 --> 08:55.320
the pop up menu for customize.

08:55.760 --> 08:56.270
OK.

08:56.280 --> 09:02.190
From this new screen along this left hand side bar we see all sorts of different settings that we can

09:02.190 --> 09:03.340
change.

09:03.360 --> 09:09.170
Now again not every theme allows you to customize all of these settings.

09:09.390 --> 09:15.120
Some themes will only let you change maybe two or three of these types of things and other themes might

09:15.120 --> 09:17.150
let you customize even more.

09:17.400 --> 09:24.450
But in my case because I'm using the 2016 theme I see an option named colors.

09:24.450 --> 09:29.250
So if I go ahead and click on that I see these different colors that I can change.

09:29.250 --> 09:32.140
So first we see something called background color.

09:32.310 --> 09:36.890
And if I click on that color patch I can choose any color I want.

09:43.880 --> 09:45.370
You get the idea.

09:45.380 --> 09:49.170
Now personally I don't want any background color or border.

09:49.220 --> 09:54.320
So for example if most of my web page has a white background I just want the very edges to be white

09:54.320 --> 09:55.160
as well.

09:55.220 --> 10:01.700
So I'm just going to click this white tile OK and then if I click on this color tile again that will

10:01.700 --> 10:03.000
collapse that menu.

10:03.110 --> 10:08.900
OK the next color is called page background color and this is what controls the vast majority of the

10:08.900 --> 10:13.640
screen so feel free to choose whatever you like.

10:13.640 --> 10:15.250
I'm going to stick with white.

10:15.560 --> 10:18.570
Let's click this to toggle that or to close it again.

10:18.750 --> 10:21.020
OK the next color is link color.

10:21.170 --> 10:24.740
So instead of blue I'm going to choose maybe like a red or pink

10:30.160 --> 10:30.550
OK.

10:30.580 --> 10:35.860
And you'll notice that that changes the colors of the links in the sidebar and the hover color.

10:35.860 --> 10:41.800
So when I hover over a title or if I hover over any of the links in the navigation menu it uses that

10:41.800 --> 10:43.640
new color that I just chose.

10:43.840 --> 10:50.240
OK the next color main text color I think that goes without saying that's what controls the main text.

10:50.320 --> 10:55.510
I'm going to leave that as black just so that my text is easy to read for everyone.

10:56.450 --> 11:05.810
And in secondary text color we can see that this 20:16 theme uses that color for things like the day

11:06.250 --> 11:08.000
the slogan of our website.

11:08.010 --> 11:09.600
So on and so forth.

11:09.600 --> 11:11.580
So I will just set that back to the default.

11:11.600 --> 11:13.300
Gray I think that looks good.

11:13.530 --> 11:19.540
And at this point I'm happy with my changes so I will click this save and publish button up at the top.

11:20.650 --> 11:21.120
OK.

11:21.120 --> 11:26.540
And then to get back to our main admin dashboard we can just click this X in the top corner.

11:27.130 --> 11:33.030
And now just to test things out if I jump back to my public facing Web site we can see that those customisations

11:33.030 --> 11:36.690
are in place OK for our next bit of business.

11:36.690 --> 11:42.930
Why don't we work on customizing this header content so maybe we want to use a different title instead

11:42.930 --> 11:48.080
of my blog for the Web site or maybe we want to use a different slogan.

11:48.210 --> 11:54.180
Or maybe you have a logo for your company that you want to use here instead of a text based title.

11:54.210 --> 11:59.430
So to begin working on those changes you can go back to your admin from this link and then click on

11:59.490 --> 12:01.140
appearance and customize.

12:01.140 --> 12:02.520
Or here's a shortcut.

12:02.520 --> 12:05.970
You can just click customize right here.

12:06.030 --> 12:09.060
Now again every theme is different.

12:09.060 --> 12:13.760
The particular theme that I'm using makes it very easy to edit this content.

12:13.920 --> 12:20.010
I can just click on this blue circle icon next to my blog and it automatically takes me to the field

12:20.010 --> 12:21.250
that controls that.

12:21.480 --> 12:26.180
So maybe I want to switch this to learning WordPress.

12:26.220 --> 12:32.490
So if your theme doesn't have these blue circle icons that's OK because you can still change all of

12:32.490 --> 12:33.490
this content.

12:33.570 --> 12:35.310
You just have to know where to look for it.

12:35.460 --> 12:41.130
So for example instead of clicking this blue circle icon next to the slogan that I want to change if

12:41.130 --> 12:47.600
your theme didn't have that blue icon I can tell you that the slogan is also referred to as the tagline.

12:47.820 --> 12:53.930
So when you first get into the main customize screen you can look under the site identity option and

12:53.940 --> 12:56.290
that's where the title and the slogan live.

12:56.340 --> 13:03.060
So you could change the slogan to our slogan here or if you're like me you could just leave it completely

13:03.060 --> 13:03.860
blank.

13:04.180 --> 13:07.010
OK so I think that already looks a lot better.

13:07.200 --> 13:10.420
But what if you want to use a company logo.

13:10.500 --> 13:13.130
So an image instead of text right here.

13:13.200 --> 13:16.060
Well over in the sidebar we see this logo area.

13:16.080 --> 13:23.510
So just click on the Select logo button then click this select files button next.

13:23.520 --> 13:27.250
It's up to you to choose an image file from your computer's hard drive.

13:27.250 --> 13:29.490
You want to use in my example.

13:29.490 --> 13:31.520
I want to use this logo file

13:34.920 --> 13:35.320
OK.

13:35.330 --> 13:39.240
Then click this blue select button down here in the bottom right corner.

13:39.300 --> 13:45.050
WordPress gives me the option to crop the image but I don't want to crop it so I can just click skip

13:45.050 --> 13:49.450
cropping and there we see it.

13:49.500 --> 13:54.830
Now maybe you just want to use your logo and you want to skip this title text entirely.

13:54.900 --> 14:02.700
If that's the case you can use this display site title and tag line option and just uncheck it OK.

14:02.740 --> 14:03.970
So this looks good to me.

14:03.970 --> 14:08.020
Now I'm just going to click the blue save and publish button.

14:08.110 --> 14:11.770
If you want to go back to the full list of options that you can customize.

14:11.770 --> 14:14.090
Use this left pointing arrow.

14:14.350 --> 14:20.530
I'm done with my customisations for now so I can just click this X icon to go back to my website and

14:20.530 --> 14:27.910
that's actually going to bring this lesson to a close in our next lesson will begin creating real content

14:27.910 --> 14:33.300
for our pages to be more specific if I look at my About Us page.

14:33.370 --> 14:39.250
We see that I'm still using this placeholder content and in our next lesson we will learn how to replace

14:39.250 --> 14:46.370
this with legitimate content so we will learn how to add our own photographs YouTube videos and more.

14:46.630 --> 14:51.280
Let's keep our momentum rolling and I will see you in the next lesson.
