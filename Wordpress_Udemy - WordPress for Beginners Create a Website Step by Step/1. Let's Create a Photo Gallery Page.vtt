00:00.900 --> 00:07.800
Hello everyone in this lesson we will learn how to create a photo gallery without further ado.

00:07.800 --> 00:10.140
Let's jump right into the action.

00:10.140 --> 00:10.710
All right.

00:10.710 --> 00:14.470
So here is the home page of my public facing WordPress site.

00:14.610 --> 00:21.180
And if I use my navigation menu to navigate to my photo gallery page we can see that.

00:21.180 --> 00:26.360
Currently this page only consists of a bit of dummy or filler content.

00:26.370 --> 00:31.770
So our goal for this lesson is to replace this with real photo gallery content.

00:32.100 --> 00:38.230
So if I want to make changes to this page I can just look up here and the top bar and use this edit

00:38.280 --> 00:44.650
page button all right and then down within this main content field.

00:44.650 --> 00:58.090
Let me get rid of this text and instead I will say below is a collection of some of my favorite photographs.

00:58.150 --> 01:00.330
Then I will drop down to a new line.

01:00.340 --> 01:02.100
So here's my cursor.

01:02.320 --> 01:05.200
And now I want to create a photo gallery.

01:05.290 --> 01:07.120
So a grid of images.

01:07.210 --> 01:09.820
So maybe I want there to be four images per row.

01:09.820 --> 01:16.060
So one image here one image here one image here and one image here and then if the user clicks on any

01:16.060 --> 01:22.120
one of those four images they can view the larger full resolution copy of the photograph.

01:22.120 --> 01:28.350
So if I want to create a photo gallery my first step is to use this button right here that reads add

01:28.360 --> 01:34.410
media and let's pay attention to this left hand side of this pop up screen.

01:34.450 --> 01:38.050
Currently we are viewing the insert media screen.

01:38.260 --> 01:41.160
And our goal is to create a photo gallery.

01:41.290 --> 01:46.810
So we actually want to switch to this create gallery screen so go ahead and click that.

01:47.270 --> 01:47.730
OK.

01:47.740 --> 01:52.640
And now we just build up a collection of images that will make up our photo gallery.

01:52.660 --> 01:59.710
Currently this media library link is selected and this is basically WordPress asking me if I want to

01:59.710 --> 02:04.370
use any of my previously uploaded images in my photo gallery.

02:04.450 --> 02:08.610
In my case these are the only two images that I've uploaded in the past.

02:08.650 --> 02:14.920
And I don't want to use those in my photo gallery so I'm going to need to upload new photographs from

02:14.920 --> 02:17.820
my hard drive to fill up this gallery.

02:18.130 --> 02:24.230
So to do that I'm going to click on this upload files button.

02:24.530 --> 02:31.950
Then I will click on select files and from here it's up to you to find the photographs on your computer's

02:31.950 --> 02:35.610
hard drive that you want to use in your photo gallery.

02:35.610 --> 02:46.740
So in my case I have a folder on my desktop named assets and I'm going to use these 8 images.

02:46.790 --> 02:53.240
You can click and drag to select multiple images to upload at once or if you're using Windows you should

02:53.240 --> 02:59.090
be able to hold down either the control or shift key and then individually click on the different images

02:59.090 --> 03:00.260
you want.

03:00.260 --> 03:06.190
Or if you're using a Mac you can use the command key or the Apple key and hold that down.

03:06.200 --> 03:09.970
And then you can click on the individual images that you were interested in.

03:12.250 --> 03:12.590
OK.

03:12.590 --> 03:18.410
Now depending on the speed of your internet connection and how many photos you uploaded and how large

03:18.440 --> 03:24.860
each file was the uploading process might take a minute or two or maybe even five or ten minutes but

03:24.860 --> 03:30.500
once it's complete you will see thumbnails for all of your images here and basically any image that

03:30.500 --> 03:36.560
has a checkmark next to it will be added to this new photo gallery that we are trying to create.

03:36.560 --> 03:43.550
So for example all of the images we see right now except for these two are the images that I just right

03:43.550 --> 03:47.100
now uploaded and they all have check marks.

03:47.150 --> 03:53.030
But if for some reason I did want to use one of these two images that I uploaded on a previous day I

03:53.030 --> 03:55.090
could just click on them.

03:55.150 --> 03:59.120
So now they have the checkmarks but obviously I don't actually want to use them.

03:59.120 --> 04:03.150
So then I can just click on them again to remove the check marks.

04:03.160 --> 04:03.570
All right.

04:03.580 --> 04:08.500
So once you've selected all of the images that you want to use in your gallery and they have check marks

04:08.500 --> 04:11.770
on them go ahead and click this blue.

04:11.800 --> 04:19.490
Create a new gallery button from this screen you are free to drag and drop to reorder your gallery.

04:19.580 --> 04:25.820
So maybe I want this elephant photographed come first and then I want the cat wearing glasses to come

04:25.820 --> 04:26.530
second.

04:26.540 --> 04:27.700
You get the idea.

04:27.740 --> 04:35.480
Also you are free to add captions for each photo here so I could click here and say elephant with baby

04:35.480 --> 04:36.520
elephant.

04:37.070 --> 04:42.680
Maybe I don't need a caption for this cat photograph but maybe for this cupcake photo I want to say

04:43.220 --> 04:44.510
cupcakes.

04:44.720 --> 04:45.980
You get the idea.

04:45.980 --> 04:49.540
Now I do want to bring your attention to this right hand column.

04:49.610 --> 04:55.570
So the first option we see here is linked to and this is what controls what will happen when a visitor

04:55.580 --> 04:59.450
of our Web site clicks on one of these thumbnail images.

04:59.450 --> 05:06.240
So if I click this I'm going to select media file so that way when a visitor clicks on one of the thumbnails

05:06.300 --> 05:10.370
it will take them directly to the full large resolution.

05:10.380 --> 05:12.620
Original copy of the photograph.

05:12.780 --> 05:14.950
The next option is columns.

05:15.090 --> 05:19.340
You are free to choose however many photos you want to be per row.

05:19.350 --> 05:24.240
I think it would look good if there were four photographs per row so I choose four.

05:24.480 --> 05:29.810
I'm not sure why you would want to randomize the order but you're free to check that if you want to.

05:29.850 --> 05:35.820
I will leave it unchecked so that the order that I created will stay intact and then the last option

05:35.820 --> 05:41.190
size controls the size of the image before the user clicks on one of the images.

05:41.370 --> 05:43.860
You're free to change this and experiment with it.

05:43.890 --> 05:48.610
But I would say that nine times out of 10 thumbnail is probably the best bet.

05:48.690 --> 05:51.850
OK I'm happy with those options so I will click this bottom right.

05:51.870 --> 05:57.430
Insert gallery button here we can see our new photo gallery.

05:57.440 --> 06:03.530
And why don't we go ahead and update this page using this blue update button and then see what it looks

06:03.530 --> 06:06.400
like on the public front end of our website.

06:06.590 --> 06:13.380
So up here we see page successfully created and I can use this link to jump to my public Web site.

06:14.080 --> 06:15.310
Let me scroll down a bit.

06:16.340 --> 06:17.290
Looks good.

06:17.410 --> 06:19.760
And if I click on the elephant thumbnail

06:22.550 --> 06:25.610
it takes me to the original large resolution.

06:25.610 --> 06:32.300
Very high quality copy of the photograph and then I can just use my web browsers back arrow button to

06:32.300 --> 06:33.670
go back a page.

06:34.010 --> 06:36.320
OK and practice makes perfect.

06:36.350 --> 06:39.510
So why don't we try to create another photo gallery.

06:39.590 --> 06:44.800
I want to point out that we can include multiple galleries on the same page.

06:44.930 --> 06:53.000
So I want to edit this photo gallery page again so up in my top bar I will use this edit page link so

06:53.010 --> 06:58.800
down here within our main content field I will click to the right of the gallery to place my cursor

06:58.830 --> 07:03.870
there and then I will use my enter or return key to drop down to a new line.

07:04.350 --> 07:12.540
And why don't we create a bit of text that reads seen in photos and maybe instead of standard paragraph

07:12.540 --> 07:19.210
text I want this to look like a headline so I just select this text and then up here from this menu

07:20.700 --> 07:27.270
I will choose heading level 2 and then right below that headline I will just push enter to drop down

07:27.270 --> 07:28.570
to a new line.

07:28.860 --> 07:33.960
And now why don't I add another photo gallery so my cursor is where I want it.

07:33.960 --> 07:40.080
We can see it blinking and now I'm just going to use this add media button.

07:40.180 --> 07:47.470
I will click Create gallery over here in the left hand column and I could create a new gallery by reusing

07:47.470 --> 07:53.530
some of these images that I've already uploaded but I want to upload a few new images so click upload

07:53.530 --> 07:54.590
files here.

07:55.500 --> 08:03.710
It then select files I have a folder on my computer named scenic and it contains these four photographs

08:03.710 --> 08:05.330
that I want to use.

08:09.520 --> 08:10.560
OK looks good.

08:10.570 --> 08:16.360
We can see that the four new images I just uploaded are the only four with the checkmark on them.

08:16.360 --> 08:16.960
Perfect.

08:16.960 --> 08:20.310
Those are the only four that I want in my new image gallery.

08:20.470 --> 08:23.240
So I will just click Create new gallery down here.

08:24.230 --> 08:30.170
Maybe I want this mountain to be the first photo so I can just drag and drop over on this right hand

08:30.170 --> 08:31.120
column.

08:31.250 --> 08:35.710
I'll change this to media file and I want per row.

08:35.720 --> 08:40.330
So I will change columns to 4 for column grid.

08:40.610 --> 08:45.920
And now I can just click insert gallery and there we have it.

08:45.970 --> 08:51.850
Now before I save this page I do want to point out that it's not like you can only add photo galleries

08:51.850 --> 09:01.420
to a page that has a title of photo gallery you can add a photo gallery to any page in any post.

09:01.420 --> 09:06.820
Ok so feel free to use this technique wherever you see fit on your Web site.

09:06.820 --> 09:10.170
Having said that I will click the blue update button.

09:10.720 --> 09:13.090
OK here we see page successfully updated.

09:13.090 --> 09:15.880
I will use this link to preview things.

09:15.880 --> 09:20.190
Let me scroll down a bit perfect so here's our first photo gallery.

09:20.200 --> 09:21.820
Here's our new headline.

09:22.040 --> 09:24.470
And here's the second photo gallery.

09:24.470 --> 09:28.280
And if I click on one of these thumbnails so let me click on this one.

09:29.090 --> 09:33.740
It takes me to the original full resolution copy of the photograph.

09:33.740 --> 09:39.350
Now you'll notice that I need to use my web browser back button to navigate back to the Web site.

09:39.380 --> 09:44.740
If I want to click on a different photograph so again I would have to click the back button.

09:46.010 --> 09:48.830
And maybe I want to view this fourth photograph.

09:48.920 --> 09:49.320
Cool.

09:49.370 --> 09:54.730
And then I would have to click the back button again so we can see that that is not ideal.

09:54.800 --> 10:00.470
In a perfect world our visitors would not have to keep clicking the back button on their browser.

10:00.470 --> 10:05.990
In a perfect world maybe when a visitor clicks one of these thumbnails it would open a larger copy of

10:05.990 --> 10:11.840
the image that maybe takes up this portion of the screen and then the outer edges of the screen would

10:11.840 --> 10:18.560
maybe be a slightly transparent black background and maybe there would be a small x button right about

10:18.560 --> 10:18.920
here.

10:18.920 --> 10:26.410
You get the idea and the user can maybe click forward and back arrows to switch between different photographs.

10:26.450 --> 10:33.920
That kind of a layout and behavior is often referred to as a light box or a modal or sometimes it's

10:33.920 --> 10:39.220
even referred to as a pop up photo gallery or a pop up slide show or pop up carousel.

10:39.320 --> 10:43.940
But most of the time we will hear that referred to as either a light box or modal.

10:43.940 --> 10:49.370
Anyways long story short the point that I'm trying to make is that that behavior would be much better

10:49.370 --> 10:54.710
than what we currently have because visitors of our website should not have to use the back button in

10:54.710 --> 10:59.950
their browser to switch between the different full resolution copies of the photos.

10:59.960 --> 11:02.460
It's just not a user friendly experience.

11:02.510 --> 11:10.310
So in our next lesson we will learn how to customize WordPress to use a lightbox or modal or a pop up

11:10.310 --> 11:15.170
type of behavior when visitors click on one of our thumbnails to pique your interest.

11:15.170 --> 11:16.690
Maybe a little bit more.

11:16.850 --> 11:23.260
In other words our next lesson will be our first exposure to something called a plugin.

11:23.300 --> 11:28.230
So in our next lesson we will answer the question what in the world is a plug in.

11:28.340 --> 11:34.420
And we will leverage the power of plug ins to create the exact photo gallery experience that we want.

11:34.420 --> 11:35.830
It should be a lot of fun.

11:35.840 --> 11:40.240
Let's keep things rolling and I will see you in the next lesson.
