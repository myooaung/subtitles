00:01.000 --> 00:08.670
Hello everyone in this lesson we will learn about user accounts in wordpress to be more specific.

00:08.770 --> 00:10.370
Here's what we're going to cover.

00:10.450 --> 00:16.290
First we will learn how to change your author name that gets displayed on the front end of your website.

00:16.300 --> 00:23.170
After that we will learn how to add or customize your avatar profile photo so that way depending on

00:23.170 --> 00:27.990
your theme you can have a little photo of yourself appear next to all of your posts.

00:28.000 --> 00:33.850
After that we will learn how to create new additional accounts for your friends or coworkers.

00:34.090 --> 00:37.900
So that way your website can have multiple authors.

00:37.990 --> 00:45.100
And finally we will work to understand the different user roles that are available in wordpress.

00:45.250 --> 00:50.980
Right because maybe we do want to invite a friend or coworker to help contribute to our Web site but

00:50.980 --> 00:57.040
we don't want that person to have full administrative access to customize anything and everything on

00:57.040 --> 00:57.960
our website.

00:58.210 --> 01:03.730
Without further ado let's start with our first goal which is to learn how to change the author name

01:03.880 --> 01:06.250
that gets displayed on our posts.

01:06.310 --> 01:13.390
So for example here's the home page of my website and if I navigate to the recipes category archive

01:13.960 --> 01:19.500
and then if I click on any of these posts so Greek salad or homemade french bread.

01:19.810 --> 01:25.430
Once I click on one of them I'm taken to the detail screen for just that one single post.

01:25.570 --> 01:29.380
And here we can see my profile Avatar photo.

01:29.410 --> 01:37.390
And more importantly my name now at the moment it reads kiddo admin which is my username so you can

01:37.390 --> 01:42.070
imagine that we don't want to share the visitors of our website our user name here.

01:42.190 --> 01:45.460
It would make much more sense to show them our real name.

01:45.700 --> 01:47.990
So let me show you how to customize this.

01:48.130 --> 01:57.310
If we jump into the admin dashboard and then in the left hand side bar look for users OK and then on

01:57.310 --> 02:02.850
this screen we will see a list of all registered users within our website.

02:03.010 --> 02:07.800
Now obviously at the moment we just have the one my main admin account.

02:07.930 --> 02:09.440
So go ahead and click on it.

02:10.450 --> 02:14.870
And from this screen I want to draw your attention to this name Area.

02:17.140 --> 02:17.530
All right.

02:17.530 --> 02:22.070
So you can see that the user name field is grayed out because we cannot change that.

02:22.150 --> 02:25.640
That's the username that you chose at the very beginning of this course.

02:25.720 --> 02:28.650
And once you choose that it's really set in stone.

02:28.660 --> 02:34.780
However we can input a first name a last name and a nickname.

02:34.930 --> 02:36.700
So let's try this out for first name.

02:36.700 --> 02:43.720
I will say Kitty because I'm pretending that my cat is the author of this Web site for last name I will

02:43.720 --> 02:45.770
say hello kitty Doh.

02:46.030 --> 02:50.140
And for nickname I will say Kitty the cat.

02:50.500 --> 02:55.560
Ok and now that we've entered content for these three fields here's the important part.

02:55.600 --> 03:03.640
Now down here within this display name publicly as within this field now we can choose how we want to

03:03.640 --> 03:08.700
display our name on the front end of our Web site so we can choose our username.

03:08.770 --> 03:14.770
Our first name our last name our first and last name combined our last name first and then our first

03:14.770 --> 03:17.410
name or our nickname.

03:17.410 --> 03:19.150
So feel free to choose whatever you like.

03:19.150 --> 03:21.100
I'm going to choose my nickname.

03:21.160 --> 03:22.160
Kitty the cat.

03:22.390 --> 03:28.850
Ok then just scroll down to the very bottom of this page and click the blue update profile button.

03:30.340 --> 03:37.370
Ok and now that we've made that change if I jumped back to the homemade french bread blog post or any

03:37.370 --> 03:39.040
post for that matter.

03:39.050 --> 03:39.550
Perfect.

03:39.560 --> 03:43.670
Now we can see the my author name gets displayed as Kitty the cat.

03:43.930 --> 03:46.490
OK so we've completed our first goal.

03:46.490 --> 03:52.380
Now let's change gears and learn how to customize our avatar profile photo.

03:52.400 --> 03:58.700
So if I zoom in a bit you can see that currently my profile photo is a cat and you might be wondering

03:58.700 --> 04:01.840
how you can add an Avatar like that to your account.

04:01.850 --> 04:09.050
I do want to stress the point that every theme is different and I'm using the 2016 theme which chooses

04:09.050 --> 04:12.010
to show my avatar and my author name.

04:12.050 --> 04:17.000
But depending on the theme that you're using it might be placed in a different location or it might

04:17.000 --> 04:18.290
not be used at all.

04:18.410 --> 04:21.310
But if you're using a theme that supports avatars.

04:21.320 --> 04:23.080
Let me show you how to add one.

04:23.090 --> 04:28.390
All you need to do is perform a Google search for Gravatar.

04:28.400 --> 04:30.730
Here is the official Gravatar Web site.

04:30.740 --> 04:32.810
It's Gravatar dot com.

04:32.810 --> 04:36.800
And from this Web site you can create a free Gravatar account.

04:36.860 --> 04:42.290
So just like you would create a free account with services like Twitter or Facebook or Pinterest you

04:42.290 --> 04:48.290
create an account with the Gravatar service now creating and setting up your Gravatar account is very

04:48.290 --> 04:50.030
simple very intuitive.

04:50.060 --> 04:52.140
So we don't need to walk through it together.

04:52.220 --> 04:54.860
But I do want to stress one key point.

04:55.100 --> 05:01.610
When you sign up for your Gravatar account be sure that you use the same e-mail address that you used

05:01.700 --> 05:04.620
for your Wordpress administrator account.

05:04.640 --> 05:10.820
What I mean by that is if I jump back to my wordpress admin dashboard and in the sidebar if I click

05:10.820 --> 05:12.130
on users.

05:12.560 --> 05:16.450
So at the moment you probably just have the one admin account of yours.

05:16.640 --> 05:22.880
So whatever e-mail address you used for that account be sure you use that same e-mail address when you

05:22.880 --> 05:28.180
create your Gravatar account as long as that e-mail address lines up and matches.

05:28.220 --> 05:30.410
You don't need to do anything else.

05:30.410 --> 05:36.230
WordPress will automatically look for your e-mail address within the Gravatar service and it will begin

05:36.230 --> 05:38.720
pulling in your profile photo.

05:38.720 --> 05:43.310
All right so now you know how to associate an avatar with your user account.

05:43.310 --> 05:48.350
Feel free to pause this lesson and go create a Gravatar account right now if you'd like to.

05:48.530 --> 05:55.040
And now let's change gears and learn how to create new user accounts within WordPress.

05:55.100 --> 05:55.430
Right.

05:55.430 --> 06:01.800
Because maybe we want to invite a friend or a family member or a coworker to help us manage the Web

06:01.800 --> 06:02.310
site.

06:02.450 --> 06:06.100
Maybe we want multiple authors on the Web site.

06:06.170 --> 06:07.600
It's super easy to set up.

06:07.640 --> 06:08.670
So check this out.

06:08.840 --> 06:16.460
Let's jump back to our admin dashboard and in the sidebar when we hover over the users option within

06:16.460 --> 06:21.040
this pop out menu we see an item named add new.

06:21.320 --> 06:26.810
So go ahead and click on Add new and then from this screen we just need to fill in a bit of info about

06:26.810 --> 06:30.950
our colleague or friend or family member that we want to invite.

06:30.950 --> 06:33.450
So first let's give them a user name.

06:33.500 --> 06:39.710
In my case since I'm acting like my cat is the main administrator of the web site I will pretend that

06:39.710 --> 06:42.470
my cat is inviting me to contribute.

06:42.470 --> 06:50.690
So for the new username account I will say Brad then enter the new person's email address and you can

06:50.690 --> 06:53.530
fill out these fields but they are not required.

06:53.720 --> 06:59.630
Now when it comes to the password for this new account WordPress will generate a really long secure

06:59.630 --> 07:02.150
password for us automatically.

07:02.300 --> 07:05.290
If you want to see the passwords you can keep note of it.

07:05.300 --> 07:07.810
Just go ahead and click the show password button.

07:07.850 --> 07:13.340
Otherwise you can just make sure that this box is checked and then WordPress will send the new user

07:13.340 --> 07:20.300
an email with an activation link they can click where they can immediately choose their own new password.

07:20.300 --> 07:25.910
Now before we click this add new user button I want to bring your attention to this role field because

07:25.910 --> 07:29.350
this is perhaps the most important thing on this screen.

07:29.420 --> 07:33.830
So when I click on this field I can choose between five different options.

07:33.860 --> 07:39.520
Subscriber contributor author editor and administrator.

07:39.530 --> 07:44.680
Now in just a moment I will explain what each of these five options means in detail.

07:44.750 --> 07:49.910
But before we jump into that I just want to say that this field is basically just asking you the question

07:50.240 --> 07:55.150
How much do you trust this new person that you're inviting into your wordpress.

07:55.280 --> 08:00.100
OK and then based on how much you trust that person or how much faith you want to place in that person

08:00.410 --> 08:03.060
you choose a role level accordingly.

08:03.200 --> 08:06.460
So now let's go through these options one by one.

08:06.620 --> 08:11.690
I'm actually going to go through them in the opposite order that WordPress lists them because I think

08:11.690 --> 08:13.300
this makes more sense.

08:13.310 --> 08:14.970
So let's start with administrator.

08:14.990 --> 08:15.980
What does that mean.

08:16.100 --> 08:22.740
Well that's basically full access and control of literally everything within your Wordpress Web site.

08:22.970 --> 08:28.250
That's the role that your current user admin account has right throughout this course.

08:28.250 --> 08:29.970
You have been the administrator.

08:30.120 --> 08:36.690
So you have full rights and privileges to change anything unless you really truly trust someone and

08:36.690 --> 08:38.380
they have great technical skills.

08:38.520 --> 08:42.410
I probably wouldn't grant them full administrator access.

08:42.540 --> 08:45.030
OK let's move on to the editor role.

08:45.150 --> 08:51.690
So an editor has permissions to create and edit any post so they can create their own posts.

08:51.720 --> 08:58.260
They can edit and change other people's posts and they can fully publish the content up live on to the

08:58.260 --> 08:59.120
Web site.

08:59.340 --> 09:02.130
Next let's talk about the author role.

09:02.190 --> 09:08.790
So an author can create and edit their own posts but they cannot edit any other posts that were created

09:08.790 --> 09:10.080
by other people.

09:10.110 --> 09:12.490
So an author has a little bit of independence.

09:12.540 --> 09:17.700
They can create a draft for a post and then indeed they can also publish that post live up onto the

09:17.700 --> 09:23.460
Web site but they're kind of locked into their own sandbox because they can't make changes to any other

09:23.460 --> 09:24.900
author's posts.

09:24.900 --> 09:32.130
Next let's talk about the contributor role a contributor can create a draft for a post but they can't

09:32.190 --> 09:37.480
actually publish it live up onto the Web site for the whole world to view.

09:37.620 --> 09:43.930
So the contributor role is a great option if you want someone to help write guest posts for your website.

09:43.950 --> 09:49.860
They can sign in and create rough drafts for post but then it's up to an editor or an administrator

09:50.040 --> 09:53.850
to review their post and finalize it or publish it.

09:53.890 --> 10:00.990
Also once an editor or an administrator does indeed publish a contributor's post from that point forward

10:00.990 --> 10:03.430
the contributor cannot make changes to it.

10:03.540 --> 10:08.820
So the contributor just creates the rough draft and then once it gets published it's out of their hands.

10:08.820 --> 10:14.280
At that point it's up to the administrators and the editors to make any future changes to the article

10:14.340 --> 10:15.660
if necessary.

10:15.660 --> 10:20.910
And finally let's talk about the subscriber role a subscriber can't really do anything.

10:21.000 --> 10:24.260
They can't even create rough drafts for blog posts.

10:24.390 --> 10:30.470
All the subscriber can do is sign in and change their first name last name and nickname that's it.

10:30.480 --> 10:33.820
You might be wondering why the subscriber role even exists.

10:33.960 --> 10:36.420
Well it's outside the scope of this course.

10:36.540 --> 10:42.240
But when you get into more advanced things like e-commerce where if you try to create the next big social

10:42.240 --> 10:48.400
network like Facebook there are plug ins that can help you create those sorts of things within Wordpress

10:48.630 --> 10:55.140
and in those types of cases advanced plugin developers can do some pretty creative things with the subscriber

10:55.160 --> 11:00.990
role but within the context of this course and what we are trying to achieve with user accounts we don't

11:00.990 --> 11:03.630
have any real need for the subscriber role.

11:03.720 --> 11:08.130
Now that weve gone over these five roles Let's get back to the task at hand.

11:08.250 --> 11:14.340
So remember I'm pretending that my cat is creating a new user account for me and when it comes to the

11:14.340 --> 11:19.860
role let's say that my cat says that I can be an editor.

11:19.940 --> 11:20.290
All right.

11:20.300 --> 11:28.260
And then I will click the Add New User button and now from this main user's screen here's the list of

11:28.260 --> 11:31.250
all registered users and there are now two of them.

11:31.470 --> 11:38.850
Now at the moment in this web browser I'm still logged in as kindo admin but just as an example why

11:38.850 --> 11:43.620
don't I open up a new web browser and sign in as the Brad user.

11:43.800 --> 11:47.550
So here's a new browser window where I'm not signed in as anyone.

11:47.650 --> 11:52.250
We can tell that's the case because there's no black admin bar along the top.

11:52.260 --> 11:58.500
However if I want to sign in with my new Bradd account all I need to do is go up into the address bar

11:58.800 --> 12:07.500
and add on slash W.P. and then I can either visit dasht log in HP.

12:07.800 --> 12:10.420
So that would successfully take me to a log in screen.

12:10.440 --> 12:14.490
Or you can visit W.P. dash admen.

12:14.590 --> 12:19.130
So I think either of those to the end of the route of your you are l will do the trick.

12:19.290 --> 12:22.770
Both you or els will ask for the new username and password.

12:22.800 --> 12:26.120
So remember my new user name is Brad.

12:26.200 --> 12:30.230
And then behind the scenes let me type in my password and then click log in.

12:30.430 --> 12:30.820
OK.

12:30.820 --> 12:35.650
So here's the admin dashboard as viewed by my Bradd account.

12:35.920 --> 12:40.680
And remember my new Bradd account is not an administrator it's an editor.

12:40.750 --> 12:47.210
And remember of the 5 user roles aside from Administrator editor is the next most powerful.

12:47.350 --> 12:53.230
So if we look at my left hand sidebar you can see that as an editor I can create new posts.

12:53.230 --> 13:00.310
I can create new pages and if I click on posts I can even edit existing posts that were created by the

13:00.310 --> 13:01.730
administrator.

13:01.840 --> 13:02.990
The Katic count.

13:03.070 --> 13:07.670
Now you might be wondering what are the limitations of an editor accountant.

13:07.810 --> 13:16.090
Well you'll notice that in my sidebar I don't have a plugins option nor do I have a settings option

13:16.210 --> 13:18.430
or an appearance option.

13:18.460 --> 13:22.140
Those are things that only administrators have access to.

13:22.240 --> 13:27.470
So that means as an editor I can't customize the look and feel of the Web site.

13:27.550 --> 13:33.370
I can't change the design or the navigation menus but I can add new content.

13:33.370 --> 13:35.030
So let's try that out right now.

13:35.170 --> 13:42.390
Let's just create a new post really quick so I will click Add new and let's imagine.

13:42.430 --> 13:47.700
I want to create a new blog post named chocolate cake for the content.

13:47.710 --> 13:56.410
I will just say Loren if some chocolate cake recipe will be placed here shortly.

13:56.410 --> 13:57.780
Check back soon.

13:58.060 --> 14:04.480
And then if I scroll down in the right hand side bar and look under categories I will assign this post

14:04.720 --> 14:09.880
into the recipes category and let's go ahead and publish this post.

14:11.750 --> 14:17.280
Now if I check out the front facing portion of my website click on recipes.

14:17.370 --> 14:20.450
Here we see the newest post is by Brad.

14:20.450 --> 14:22.740
Here is my username and profile photo.

14:22.800 --> 14:24.600
Chocolate cake.

14:24.810 --> 14:30.070
Now if we look closely the author name uses a lower case b for bread.

14:30.270 --> 14:34.710
So that means it's using my user name instead of my full name or nickname.

14:35.040 --> 14:40.600
So practice makes perfect if we want to change the way this author named display is.

14:40.770 --> 14:47.970
We can just go back into the admin dashboard in the sidebar click on profile instead of users.

14:48.060 --> 14:55.830
It can be a bit confusing because administrators see the word users in the sidebar but editors authors

14:55.830 --> 14:59.120
contributors and subscribers only see profile.

14:59.280 --> 15:05.430
But anyways go ahead and click on profile and if we scroll down a bit you can enter in your first or

15:05.430 --> 15:06.960
last name where your nickname.

15:06.960 --> 15:15.150
So I will just change my nickname to Brad the chef and then under this display name publicly as field.

15:15.180 --> 15:18.120
Change that to the nickname option.

15:18.150 --> 15:22.980
Then scroll down to the very bottom of this page and click Update profile.

15:23.890 --> 15:30.100
And then if I jump back to the front facing portion of the Web site and refresh perfect.

15:30.110 --> 15:37.000
So now the author name reads Brad the chef and that's actually going to bring this lesson to a close.

15:37.010 --> 15:42.950
I hope this lesson encouraged you to collaborate with other people to create better and better content

15:43.250 --> 15:49.760
because even if you don't 100 percent trust someone you can always assign their user account the contributor

15:49.760 --> 15:55.760
role and then you will have final say as the owner of the website before anything gets truly posted

15:56.090 --> 15:58.640
onto your website for the entire world to view.

15:58.640 --> 16:02.220
There is no real limit to how many different user accounts you create.

16:02.270 --> 16:06.570
So feel free to invite and collaborate with as many people as you would like.

16:06.590 --> 16:13.490
All right now changing gears in our next lesson we will learn about a few miscellaneous but very important

16:13.490 --> 16:16.750
settings in wordpress that we can customize.

16:16.820 --> 16:19.360
It should be an eye opening experience.

16:19.370 --> 16:23.430
Let's keep things rolling and I will see you in the next lesson.
