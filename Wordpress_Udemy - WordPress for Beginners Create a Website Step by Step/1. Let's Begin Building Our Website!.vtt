00:00.840 --> 00:06.420
Hello everyone in this lesson you will actually begin building your website.

00:06.660 --> 00:09.510
So without further ado let's get started.

00:09.840 --> 00:14.360
So here we see my wordpress Web site that I created in the last lesson.

00:14.460 --> 00:18.670
If you followed along you also now have your own WordPress Web site.

00:19.020 --> 00:22.870
And what we're looking at right now is the public facing portion of the site.

00:23.040 --> 00:23.270
Right.

00:23.270 --> 00:30.210
So anyone in the world can see this but if we want to begin building and customizing our Web site we

00:30.210 --> 00:34.880
want to switch over to the back and administrative dashboard screens.

00:35.040 --> 00:38.280
Now you still might be logged in as the admin.

00:38.430 --> 00:42.040
If that's the case obviously you don't need to log in again.

00:42.240 --> 00:52.820
So up in the address bar at the end of your you Arel add on a slash and then W.P. dash add in.

00:52.980 --> 00:57.070
Now if you're still logged in that will take you to the admin screens.

00:57.330 --> 01:02.780
And if you're not logged in wordpress is smart enough to redirect you to the log in page.

01:02.790 --> 01:08.130
Now once you've logged in and made it to the admin screen the first thing I want to bring to your attention

01:08.190 --> 01:14.640
is this top bar that runs along the very top of the page towards the left hand side of this bar we see

01:14.640 --> 01:17.830
a home icon and then the name of your website.

01:18.060 --> 01:22.180
In my case it's my blog but your site might be named something different.

01:22.350 --> 01:29.850
Anyways if you click that link it will let you switch back and forth between the front and public facing

01:29.850 --> 01:31.420
portion of your website.

01:31.500 --> 01:37.820
And if I click on it again it takes me back to the back and administrative part of the website.

01:38.110 --> 01:41.750
OK so that's a very useful link to be aware of.

01:41.760 --> 01:43.940
Now with that out of the way let's begin.

01:43.950 --> 01:46.240
Actually building our website.

01:46.560 --> 01:50.210
Let's start by creating a new blog post.

01:50.430 --> 01:55.780
So in this lefthand menu area let's click on posts.

01:55.780 --> 01:56.280
All right.

01:56.280 --> 02:02.310
This screen will show us a list of all the posts that currently exist on our website because my web

02:02.310 --> 02:03.300
site is brand new.

02:03.300 --> 02:05.850
You can see that it says no posts found.

02:05.850 --> 02:06.110
Right.

02:06.120 --> 02:08.550
We haven't created any posts yet.

02:08.550 --> 02:14.280
Depending on the web hosting company that you're using They might have created a few sample or dummy

02:14.280 --> 02:15.550
posts for you.

02:15.720 --> 02:19.650
So if your screen doesn't look exactly like mine here that's OK.

02:19.680 --> 02:26.250
But we are interested in creating a new post so up at the top here we see this add new button you can

02:26.250 --> 02:29.900
click that or in the sidebar You can click add new.

02:29.910 --> 02:32.910
Which is nested under the posts part of the menu.

02:33.270 --> 02:40.830
So I will click Add new and this first time that we visit this edit screen WordPress will show us this

02:40.860 --> 02:42.600
pop up help message.

02:42.720 --> 02:48.420
We can just click the X in the top right corner of this message to close it OK now for our first bit

02:48.420 --> 02:51.620
of business let's add a title for this post.

02:51.840 --> 02:55.770
Let's call it my example blog post.

02:56.120 --> 03:01.640
OK and then let's switch down to this field and begin writing the content for the post.

03:02.130 --> 03:03.510
Hello everyone.

03:03.510 --> 03:06.930
This is my first blog post.

03:06.930 --> 03:10.860
It is just a quick example.

03:11.280 --> 03:12.140
You get the idea.

03:12.150 --> 03:17.190
You can type whatever you want here and then when you're happy with what you have over on the right

03:17.190 --> 03:20.880
hand side of the screen we see this blue publish button.

03:21.180 --> 03:22.780
So let's click that.

03:23.280 --> 03:29.140
And in this newest version of Wordpress it's a bit annoying but we need to click publish a second time

03:30.280 --> 03:33.760
if you're like me and you don't like having to click the button twice.

03:33.820 --> 03:39.190
You can look down towards the bottom right hand corner of the screen and we can uncheck this box that

03:39.190 --> 03:39.840
reads.

03:40.120 --> 03:42.980
Always show pre published checks.

03:43.120 --> 03:48.180
So I'm going to uncheck that so in future I don't have to click publish twice.

03:48.340 --> 03:51.660
So let's click the publish button one more time here.

03:52.430 --> 03:58.960
OK now we see the success message right here that says Post published and why don't we go test things

03:58.960 --> 03:59.170
out.

03:59.170 --> 04:05.930
Why don't we view the public front facing portion of our website and look for that new blog post.

04:05.950 --> 04:12.040
So remember we can click this link in our top bar that will take us to the public facing portion of

04:12.040 --> 04:12.610
the Web site.

04:12.640 --> 04:17.490
And if we scroll down here we see the brand new blog post that we just wrote.

04:17.830 --> 04:19.640
Now practice makes perfect.

04:19.660 --> 04:23.730
So why don't we practice creating another new blog post.

04:24.070 --> 04:30.850
So I will use this link to jump back to my admin area and then under posts in the sidebar.

04:30.850 --> 04:36.340
I will click add new Let's enter a title for this new post.

04:36.340 --> 04:40.920
How about another nude test post.

04:41.070 --> 04:41.500
All right.

04:41.500 --> 04:45.120
And then for the actual content or the body of the post.

04:45.640 --> 04:46.650
Hello world.

04:46.720 --> 04:50.240
This is a test post.

04:50.410 --> 04:59.590
You could write as much as you want to within this area and maybe I want the phrase as much as you want

04:59.590 --> 05:05.770
to to be bold so I could just highlight that and then click this B for bold.

05:05.860 --> 05:06.970
All right this looks good.

05:06.970 --> 05:13.750
So over on the right hand side I will click the blue publish button all right and then I can use this

05:13.750 --> 05:20.810
link up in the header again to switch back to my public facing web site and there it is.

05:20.830 --> 05:24.070
Notice how our newest post comes first.

05:24.070 --> 05:30.100
Right so this is the post we created a few minutes ago and this is the one we just now created.

05:30.130 --> 05:35.920
So on the front end of your website that the public sees WordPress will always sort your posts by the

05:35.920 --> 05:37.480
date that they were created.

05:37.720 --> 05:41.100
And the most recently created posts are up at the top.

05:41.230 --> 05:47.890
All right and if we click on the title for one of these posts so if I click here or here for example

05:47.890 --> 05:50.700
I will click on another new test post.

05:50.860 --> 05:57.550
Notice that that takes us to a new U R L right that takes us to a new screen or a new page and this

05:57.550 --> 06:03.480
new you are Elvis new screen is dedicated to just that one single blog post.

06:03.610 --> 06:09.520
So if you wanted to share one of your posts with friends or family or you wanted to post a link on Facebook

06:09.520 --> 06:16.000
or Twitter and you wanted to link to a particular post and not just your website in general you could

06:16.000 --> 06:19.160
share this particular link.

06:19.230 --> 06:21.190
Write in to get back to our home page.

06:21.190 --> 06:24.890
We can just click the name of our website that lives in the header.

06:24.970 --> 06:29.980
So if I click on that we are right back to the home page.

06:30.270 --> 06:35.940
OK so feel free to create as many posts as you like as often as you like.

06:36.200 --> 06:43.520
If you want to delete or make changes to one of your existing posts just visit your dashboard in the

06:43.520 --> 06:46.940
left hand menu click on posts.

06:47.120 --> 06:49.610
Here we see all of our existing posts.

06:49.670 --> 06:56.630
If you hover over one you'll see an option to click trash which will delete the post and if you want

06:56.630 --> 07:02.690
to edit or make changes to an existing post just click on its title that will take you back to the edit

07:02.690 --> 07:05.030
screen for that post.

07:05.090 --> 07:10.240
You're free to make changes here and then just save your changes by clicking the blue update button.

07:10.280 --> 07:15.860
Now at this point I want to take a moment to address a common concern you might have at this point you

07:15.860 --> 07:18.000
might be thinking to yourself is this.

07:18.020 --> 07:21.980
It is WordPress just for creating blogs.

07:22.010 --> 07:24.970
Is this the only type of Web site we can create.

07:25.070 --> 07:32.810
Right so for example maybe you do want a blog on your Web site but you don't want the home page of your

07:32.810 --> 07:34.380
website to be the blog.

07:34.730 --> 07:41.570
Maybe you want a more traditional static welcoming home page and you want a blog or a news area tucked

07:41.570 --> 07:44.190
away within its own neat page somewhere.

07:44.390 --> 07:47.120
Well the good news is that WordPress can do that.

07:47.180 --> 07:50.240
Wordpress is not limited to only creating blogs.

07:50.270 --> 07:54.480
WordPress can be used to create just about any Web site we can imagine.

07:54.710 --> 07:59.830
OK so at this point we are at least a little bit familiar with what a post is.

08:00.080 --> 08:07.610
But if we want to unlock the full potential of Wordpress our next step is to learn about pages and that

08:07.610 --> 08:11.480
is exactly what we are going to learn about in our next lesson.

08:11.480 --> 08:18.650
More importantly will learn what the differences between a post and a page and we will also learn how

08:18.650 --> 08:25.520
to create a navigation menu that lives at the top of our website that links to our different pages.

08:25.520 --> 08:25.870
Right.

08:25.880 --> 08:32.390
So maybe we want to have an About page and a contact page or a photo gallery page.

08:32.390 --> 08:33.660
You get the idea.

08:33.870 --> 08:39.080
Right so having said that let's keep things rolling and I will see you in the next lesson.
