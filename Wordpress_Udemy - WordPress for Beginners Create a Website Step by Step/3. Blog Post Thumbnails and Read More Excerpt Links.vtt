00:01.040 --> 00:09.470
Hello everyone in this lesson we will learn how to improve our blog posts to be more specific we will

00:09.470 --> 00:16.700
learn three new techniques that will allow us to create more captivating blogs too by the end of this

00:16.700 --> 00:20.040
lesson we will have answered the following questions.

00:20.100 --> 00:23.150
Number one what is a featured image.

00:23.160 --> 00:26.590
Number two what is the read more tag.

00:26.840 --> 00:32.080
And number three what is an excerpt within the context of wordpress.

00:32.090 --> 00:37.730
All right now at this point let's jump right into the action and begin answering those questions one

00:37.730 --> 00:38.610
by one.

00:38.900 --> 00:44.270
So here we are on my home page and the first thing that I'm going to do since this lesson is all about

00:44.270 --> 00:52.660
blog posts is navigate to my travel page so my navigation menu I will click on travel.

00:52.780 --> 00:53.240
All right.

00:53.250 --> 00:59.530
And remember this page will show the most recent blog posts from the travel category.

00:59.670 --> 01:03.300
So let's begin making a few improvements to this page.

01:03.390 --> 01:08.660
So here we see the first post and then the second post and then the third post.

01:08.940 --> 01:11.430
And currently this content looks a bit boring.

01:11.670 --> 01:18.240
I think it would be better if we included a photograph for each post right about here now in previous

01:18.240 --> 01:24.030
lessons we already learned how to add photographs within the content for a page or a post.

01:24.030 --> 01:30.210
Now while that is certainly a valid way of adding photos to your content in this lesson I want to show

01:30.210 --> 01:37.080
you a feature that WordPress has that will let us associate an image with a post so WordPress will create

01:37.110 --> 01:41.540
a one to one relationship between a post and its image.

01:41.540 --> 01:48.600
So for example for this trip to the Midwest post we can assign it a featured image and then WordPress

01:48.600 --> 01:53.250
will use that featured image in relation to this post throughout our website.

01:53.340 --> 01:55.990
If that explanation didn't make a whole lot of sense.

01:56.040 --> 02:01.850
That's OK because at this point let me show you visually how to add a featured image.

02:01.890 --> 02:08.670
So for example let's work on this trip to the Midwest post so I will use the top left link to go into

02:08.670 --> 02:17.260
my admin dashboard within the sidebar I will click on posts to view a list of all of my posts.

02:17.310 --> 02:23.410
Here we see trip to the Midwest so I will click on that to edit it all right.

02:23.410 --> 02:29.690
Now your first instinct if you want to add a photo here might be to click into this main content field

02:30.200 --> 02:32.680
and insert an image right here.

02:32.690 --> 02:37.970
So maybe you would use the Add media button now that will technically work but I want to show you a

02:37.970 --> 02:39.070
better way.

02:39.440 --> 02:45.350
So let's leave this main content field alone and instead I want to direct your attention to the right

02:45.350 --> 02:46.900
hand side of the screen.

02:47.000 --> 02:52.290
So if I scroll down a bit actually if I scroll down all the way.

02:52.290 --> 02:57.730
Notice in the very bottom right hand corner this box named featured image.

02:57.990 --> 03:01.830
Let's click on the set featured image link.

03:01.850 --> 03:08.120
I'm going to upload a new photo for this trip to the Midwest post so I will click on upload files.

03:09.190 --> 03:16.320
And then click select files on my computer's desktop I have a folder named assets and then within that

03:16.320 --> 03:23.130
folder I have a folder named travel for this blog post I'm going to use this photo of a field so I will

03:23.130 --> 03:24.310
select that file

03:27.330 --> 03:28.770
once it finishes uploading.

03:28.770 --> 03:34.590
I will click Set featured image towards the bottom right corner and there we see it.

03:34.800 --> 03:39.130
So at this point I'm going to scroll back up and click the blue update button.

03:41.670 --> 03:45.700
And now let me jump back to my public front facing Web site.

03:45.730 --> 03:46.780
This is the home page.

03:46.780 --> 03:54.320
Let me jump back to the travel page OK so for the first post we see the title trip to the Midwest and

03:54.320 --> 03:56.630
now we see the featured image.

03:56.630 --> 04:01.640
Now at this point you might be wondering to yourself why didn't we just add the image within the main

04:01.640 --> 04:03.770
content field for the post.

04:03.950 --> 04:09.230
What's the point of using the featured image option instead of just inserting the image along with the

04:09.230 --> 04:10.480
main content.

04:10.700 --> 04:12.350
Well there are a few reasons.

04:12.480 --> 04:18.800
So number one you'll notice that the content for this post lives in this column and the information

04:18.800 --> 04:19.660
about the post.

04:19.660 --> 04:26.390
So the date that it was posted on and the category that it lives in that information takes up this column.

04:26.420 --> 04:31.940
So if we would have inserted this image into the main content field with this text then the image would

04:31.940 --> 04:39.470
have lived in this column instead because we set this image to be the featured image our 2016 theme

04:39.470 --> 04:44.900
or whatever theme you are using will be on the lookout for the featured image and it will use it in

04:44.900 --> 04:47.140
special places in the lab.

04:47.690 --> 04:53.990
So for example if we switched to a different theme instead of the 2016 theme perhaps the featured image

04:53.990 --> 04:57.470
would be used as a smaller thumbnail right about here.

04:57.470 --> 05:03.740
The idea is that every theme is different and it's up to the theme to use the featured image in a compelling

05:03.740 --> 05:04.640
way.

05:04.640 --> 05:06.870
Now let's get back to the task at hand.

05:07.070 --> 05:11.450
My goal is to make this travel page look as nice as possible.

05:11.630 --> 05:15.350
And currently I think this photo is a bit too tall.

05:15.350 --> 05:22.040
I think it would look a lot nicer if this image used a really wide but not very tall landscape aspect

05:22.040 --> 05:22.860
ratio.

05:22.940 --> 05:23.240
Right.

05:23.240 --> 05:28.280
Because that way we are still adding a bit of captivating imagery to the screen but the image won't

05:28.280 --> 05:34.700
be as tall so it won't force users to scroll down as far just to begin reading the real content.

05:34.700 --> 05:38.990
So to edit this feature image or I should say to crop the featured image.

05:39.050 --> 05:47.060
I'm just going to jump back into my admin dashboard click on posts in the sidebar curious trip to the

05:47.060 --> 05:47.810
Midwest.

05:47.810 --> 05:49.550
Let me click that again.

05:49.760 --> 05:53.560
Scroll down and look in the very bottom right corner for featured image.

05:53.750 --> 06:01.600
And if I click on that image I can then look towards the top right corner and use this edit image option.

06:04.280 --> 06:04.660
OK.

06:04.670 --> 06:10.840
Now from this screen I can simply click and drag the portion of the image that I want to use.

06:10.850 --> 06:13.130
All right so I'm happy with that selection.

06:13.130 --> 06:17.740
Now to actually crop the image just use this first icon here.

06:20.730 --> 06:27.910
OK so that cropped the image and now just click the blue save button.

06:28.090 --> 06:34.420
Then be sure to look in the bottom right corner for set featured image perfect.

06:34.420 --> 06:40.160
So now we can see the images cropped just the way we want it so that scroll back up and click Update

06:40.170 --> 06:42.230
to truly save our changes.

06:43.680 --> 06:50.370
And now if we jump back to our front facing web site let me click on travel perfect.

06:50.400 --> 06:52.480
I think that looks pretty nice.

06:52.560 --> 06:59.910
All right now at this point in the lesson we've learned what a featured image is next let's change gears

06:59.940 --> 07:02.820
and learn about the read more tag.

07:03.060 --> 07:12.320
So for example with our trip to the Midwest post maybe on the screen that lists multiple posts maybe

07:12.320 --> 07:19.220
on this screen we only want to show the first couple of sentences of this text and then we want to include

07:19.220 --> 07:22.830
a link right about here that says Click to read more.

07:23.180 --> 07:29.300
And that link will take visitors to the detail or single view for just that one post.

07:29.300 --> 07:32.300
Now this is a fairly simple feature to implement.

07:32.300 --> 07:35.030
The only hard part is knowing where to look.

07:35.030 --> 07:36.330
So let me show you.

07:36.470 --> 07:43.120
So let me jump over to my admin dashboard and click on posts in the left hand side bar.

07:43.250 --> 07:51.330
I want to edit trip to the Midwest so I will click on that all right and let's say after these few sentences.

07:51.350 --> 07:57.050
So right here where the cursor is right now this is where I want to insert the read more link.

07:57.050 --> 08:03.410
So with my cursor placed right there I can just go up to this menu and click on this icon that I'm selecting

08:03.410 --> 08:04.300
right now.

08:04.550 --> 08:07.320
If you hover over it it reads insert.

08:07.340 --> 08:10.090
Read More tag OK.

08:10.090 --> 08:14.290
And here we can see that it was successfully added to my post.

08:14.290 --> 08:16.650
Now I'm going to save or update this post.

08:16.660 --> 08:20.300
So in the right hand column click the blue update button.

08:21.620 --> 08:24.620
Then I will jump back to my public facing Web site.

08:24.860 --> 08:28.630
Click on travel perfect.

08:28.640 --> 08:35.060
So we have our title our featured image and now we only see this little bit of text and if a visitor

08:35.060 --> 08:40.520
is intrigued by this content they can click Continue reading link or they can click on the featured

08:40.520 --> 08:42.530
image or the title.

08:42.530 --> 08:48.970
So as an example I will click on continue reading WordPress even scrolls me down to the exact point

08:48.970 --> 08:52.480
on the page where the read more insert tag was inserted.

08:52.480 --> 08:58.420
I believe I was right about here but anyways here we are on the dedicated single post view for a trip

08:58.420 --> 09:04.630
to the Midwest and if we look up in our address bar you can see that this is the detail screen for the

09:04.630 --> 09:06.880
trip to the Midwest post.

09:07.000 --> 09:07.350
All right.

09:07.360 --> 09:10.960
So that's really all there is to the read more tag.

09:11.050 --> 09:15.360
Once you know where to find that icon in the menu it's very simple to use.

09:15.580 --> 09:19.940
So feel free to use that for any and all of your posts.

09:20.320 --> 09:22.510
Ok so for a quick lesson recap.

09:22.510 --> 09:26.780
So far we've addressed featured images the read more tag.

09:27.010 --> 09:32.350
Next let's change gears and talk about excerpts as an example.

09:32.350 --> 09:38.720
I will continue to edit the trip to the Midwest post so let's jump over to the admin area.

09:38.980 --> 09:41.820
Click on posts here.

09:41.830 --> 09:42.870
Trip to the Midwest.

09:42.880 --> 09:45.100
Let's edit that one.

09:45.100 --> 09:52.450
All right now by default WordPress does not show us the option to create an excerpt in order to begin

09:52.450 --> 09:53.680
using excerpts.

09:53.680 --> 10:00.700
We need to click this button towards the top right corner of the screen named screen options.

10:00.700 --> 10:09.060
So if I click that this new menu area appears and here we see excerpt so go ahead and check the check

10:09.060 --> 10:15.550
box right near the word excerpt and then to close this menu you can just click screen options which

10:15.550 --> 10:16.460
is right about here.

10:16.480 --> 10:17.940
Just click it one more time.

10:19.130 --> 10:19.690
All right.

10:19.690 --> 10:25.570
Now if we scroll down towards the bottom of the screen towards the bottom of the left hand column.

10:25.570 --> 10:29.110
Here we see a box named excerpt.

10:29.110 --> 10:33.430
Now I realize there's a good chance you have no idea what an excerpt is.

10:33.580 --> 10:35.930
So let's find out by experimenting.

10:36.130 --> 10:38.370
So within this box I will type.

10:38.470 --> 10:49.400
This is an important snippet of text from the mid west trip post.

10:49.510 --> 10:50.430
You get the idea.

10:50.470 --> 10:59.400
You could type anything you want in this field and now if I scroll up and save or update this post and

10:59.400 --> 11:06.610
then jump back to my public facing web site and click on travel.

11:06.870 --> 11:10.980
Here we see the title of the post and here we see the excerpt.

11:10.980 --> 11:14.010
Now remember every theme is different.

11:14.160 --> 11:21.600
Now I'm using the 2016 theme and it chooses to display the excerpt right here but not every theme will

11:21.600 --> 11:22.710
do this.

11:22.710 --> 11:28.920
Each theme will style and position and use the excerpt differently in other themes.

11:28.920 --> 11:35.190
When we fill out the excerpt field it might not display this normal text here at all and it might only

11:35.190 --> 11:39.850
display the excerpt until you click Continue reading to view the full article.

11:40.140 --> 11:45.300
So I know it's a bit tricky to wrap your head around what the excerpt really is because it's different

11:45.300 --> 11:52.440
in every theme but in general the excerpt field is your chance to provide a catchy important part of

11:52.440 --> 11:59.280
the post to catch people's eyes to get their attention or to summarize the post in an interesting fashion.

11:59.280 --> 12:06.690
Also I will point out that even within a single theme the excerpt can be used in different ways on different

12:06.690 --> 12:07.580
pages.

12:07.740 --> 12:14.070
So for example on this category archive screen here we see in the excerpt used in a slightly larger

12:14.070 --> 12:15.690
than average font.

12:15.690 --> 12:25.330
However if I use my web site's search functionality and if I search for mid west there's only one result.

12:25.330 --> 12:32.110
Obviously the trip to the Midwest blog post but now you'll notice that all we see is the title The featured

12:32.110 --> 12:36.990
image and instead of the regular text here we see the XOR.

12:37.510 --> 12:40.810
Only it's not styled like a sub headline any longer.

12:40.810 --> 12:44.150
Now it just looks like standard small text.

12:44.200 --> 12:45.500
So long story short.

12:45.520 --> 12:51.910
Think of the excerpt field as your chance to summarize a post and that's actually going to bring this

12:51.910 --> 12:54.520
lesson to a close to review.

12:54.520 --> 12:59.370
We learned about featured images we learned about the read more tag.

12:59.800 --> 13:04.200
And finally we learned about excerpts in our next lesson.

13:04.210 --> 13:11.410
We will begin learning about comments comments allow visitors of your website to interact with you.

13:11.680 --> 13:18.010
If you already know for a fact that you do not want commenting enabled on your website that's ok I will

13:18.010 --> 13:20.330
show you how to disable comments.

13:20.530 --> 13:26.750
But for a lot of people and a lot of Web sites the comments section can create a vibrant community.

13:26.780 --> 13:30.630
Anyways there's a lot to be said about comments there's a lot to learn.

13:30.640 --> 13:31.800
We're going to have a blast.

13:31.840 --> 13:33.270
Let's keep things rolling.

13:33.400 --> 13:36.390
And I will see you in the next lesson.
