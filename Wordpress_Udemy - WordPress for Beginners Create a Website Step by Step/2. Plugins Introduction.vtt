00:01.030 --> 00:10.120
Hello everyone in this lesson we will answer the question what is a plug in a plugin lets us add new

00:10.120 --> 00:17.560
functionality or new features to our WordPress website or in other words when we want WordPress to be

00:17.560 --> 00:20.910
able to do something that it can't do out of the box.

00:21.010 --> 00:25.130
We can install a plugin to make the impossible possible.

00:25.270 --> 00:26.640
Here's a quick metaphor.

00:26.770 --> 00:34.060
So think of your kitchen as your WordPress website and when you first moved into your house imagine

00:34.060 --> 00:40.030
that your kitchen did not have a dishwasher machine and so you had to wash all of your dishes by hand.

00:40.270 --> 00:46.750
So that means in order to add the feature of automatic dishwashing to your kitchen you need to install

00:46.780 --> 00:48.390
a dish washing machine.

00:48.580 --> 00:52.020
So think of the dish washing machine as a plug in.

00:52.210 --> 00:57.490
You add it into your kitchen you install it within your kitchen to add the new functionality and new

00:57.490 --> 01:00.520
features of automatic dishwashing.

01:00.520 --> 01:06.190
The same is true with wordpress when we want WordPress to be able to do something new that it previously

01:06.190 --> 01:07.270
could not do.

01:07.330 --> 01:09.580
We just install a plugin.

01:09.640 --> 01:14.740
There are thousands of plug ins to choose from that can add all sorts of new features.

01:14.830 --> 01:20.970
For example in this lesson why dont we use plugins to improve our photo galleries.

01:21.250 --> 01:28.360
So if I use my main navigation to navigate to the photo gallery page and then if I click on one of these

01:28.360 --> 01:34.900
thumbnail images so maybe if I click on the elephant image it opens the high resolution photo in a new

01:34.900 --> 01:41.140
page and then visitors of our website have to use the back button on their web browser to switch back

01:41.140 --> 01:42.460
to the photo gallery.

01:42.640 --> 01:48.370
And you'll remember in our previous lesson we discussed why that's less than ideal and we reviewed how

01:48.370 --> 01:54.370
it would be better if instead when we clicked on one of the thumbnails it opened up a larger copy right

01:54.370 --> 02:00.430
here and the rest of the screen turned transparent black and maybe there were also arrows to switch

02:00.430 --> 02:06.430
back and forth to the previous and next photos in the web design industry we commonly referred to a

02:06.430 --> 02:10.630
pop up photograph like that as a light box.

02:10.750 --> 02:18.030
Now by default WordPress does not support lightbox functionality but we can leverage the power of plug

02:18.030 --> 02:23.530
ins to add that light box pop up functionality or feature to our Web site.

02:23.710 --> 02:24.640
So check this out.

02:24.640 --> 02:29.100
Lets begin by switching over to the admin dashboard of our Web site.

02:29.140 --> 02:34.400
I can use this link in my top bar to navigate to my admin area.

02:34.450 --> 02:41.950
Remember you can always get to your admin area by adding slash WP admin to the end of the route of your

02:41.970 --> 02:45.160
website you are all in if you're not already logged in.

02:45.160 --> 02:48.280
WordPress will just ask for your username and password.

02:48.490 --> 02:55.420
OK so from our dashboard lets look in the left hand side bar about a little more than halfway down for

02:55.420 --> 02:57.990
the item named plugins.

02:59.130 --> 03:05.860
All right now your plug in screen might not look exactly like mine depending on which web host you're

03:05.860 --> 03:10.020
using you may or may not have this top area that you see here.

03:10.270 --> 03:15.520
It's entirely possible that your plug in screen only contains the part that I'm highlighting right now

03:16.000 --> 03:17.010
and that's A-OK.

03:17.020 --> 03:19.290
That's actually what I would prefer.

03:19.300 --> 03:25.900
So if your plug in screen looks like mine and you do have this top area for the time being I recommend

03:25.900 --> 03:29.690
we use the top right next icon to close out of it.

03:29.710 --> 03:37.270
Basically what's going on is some web hosts pre-install a plug in named jet pack and this is just the

03:37.270 --> 03:40.460
jetpacks specific menu options up here.

03:40.560 --> 03:44.680
So for the time being I'm going to close out of that we don't need to look at it we can always bring

03:44.680 --> 03:46.060
it up again later.

03:46.350 --> 03:50.680
OK and now everyone's plugins screen should look very similar.

03:50.920 --> 03:55.640
So here we see a list of all of the plugins that are currently installed.

03:55.660 --> 04:00.910
Again different web hosts will pre-install different plugins for the time being.

04:00.910 --> 04:02.740
None of these plugins matter.

04:02.890 --> 04:05.240
OK we can review those at a later date.

04:05.290 --> 04:07.700
For now let's try something fun.

04:07.990 --> 04:15.190
Let's try to add a new plug in to our WordPress that will add the Lightbox pop up behavior to our photo

04:15.190 --> 04:16.240
galleries.

04:16.450 --> 04:23.200
So what we want to do is add a new plugin so you can either click the Add New button right here towards

04:23.200 --> 04:30.830
the top or you can click add new under the plug ins menu in the sidebar.

04:30.930 --> 04:36.630
All right now this screen lets us choose from thousands of free plugins.

04:36.690 --> 04:41.490
Now nine times out of 10 you're probably just going to want to jump right to the top right search bar

04:41.490 --> 04:47.760
area because you're probably looking for a specific plugin to solve a specific issue.

04:47.760 --> 04:55.600
So in my case I will use this top right search bar and I will search for light box.

04:55.630 --> 05:00.770
OK so we can see that that brings up all sorts of Lightbox related results.

05:00.790 --> 05:03.450
Now sometimes the results can be overwhelming.

05:03.460 --> 05:06.880
All of these plugins claimed to do basically the same thing right.

05:06.880 --> 05:12.550
They all promised to create a pop up lightbox when you click on an image right in the pop up will show

05:12.550 --> 05:15.900
you a larger higher resolution copy of the photograph.

05:16.000 --> 05:20.950
So you might be wondering how in the world are you supposed to choose one of these plug ins when there

05:20.960 --> 05:23.540
so many of them and they all seem so similar.

05:23.740 --> 05:29.290
Well that's a really good question and there's not really a scientific or correct answer but I can tell

05:29.290 --> 05:31.070
you what I usually do.

05:31.120 --> 05:34.240
So let's take this first plug in as an example.

05:34.240 --> 05:38.440
Notice here it tells us how many active installs it has.

05:38.590 --> 05:45.790
So for this plug in this means that over 50000 people or I guess I should say 50000 different WordPress

05:45.780 --> 05:48.900
Web sites are currently using this plugin.

05:49.090 --> 05:53.950
So I would always choose a plugin that has a lot of active installs.

05:53.950 --> 06:00.030
Odds are if a lot of other people are relying on a plugin it's probably a quality solution.

06:00.040 --> 06:06.090
So for example this plug in you can see that it only has about 1000 active installs.

06:06.160 --> 06:12.990
Now I'm not saying that this is a bad plugin for all I know it's the best light box plug in in the universe.

06:13.270 --> 06:16.870
But it's up to you to sort of test out and try the different plug ins.

06:16.870 --> 06:21.660
There's no scientific way to select a plug in here you kind of just have to do your own research.

06:21.880 --> 06:26.380
Also word of mouth is a huge factor when it comes to plug ins.

06:26.560 --> 06:33.010
As the weeks and months and years go by of you using WordPress you will hear your peers and other WordPress

06:33.010 --> 06:35.930
users talk about certain plugins.

06:36.070 --> 06:40.320
You'll hear the same plug in names get recommended again and again and again.

06:40.390 --> 06:47.560
So as a real life example of word of mouth I can tell you that one of the top white box plug ins is

06:47.560 --> 06:50.110
called responsive light box.

06:50.110 --> 06:54.760
So I just search for Responsive light box and it's this one.

06:54.960 --> 06:58.680
It's named responsive light box Spidy factory.

06:58.690 --> 07:02.470
Now I'm not saying that any of the other light box plug ins are bad.

07:02.470 --> 07:08.440
All I'm saying is that I've had very good experiences with this plugin in the past and we can see that

07:08.440 --> 07:11.400
it has over 200000 active installs.

07:11.710 --> 07:17.770
So I'm not alone in enjoying this plugin so you're free to use whatever plugin you like but for the

07:17.770 --> 07:19.600
purposes of this course.

07:19.600 --> 07:26.020
Why don't you search for and use the same plug in as me responsive lightbox by factory and then you

07:26.020 --> 07:28.570
can just click this install now button.

07:31.600 --> 07:36.310
It should just take a few seconds to install and once it completes then the button will turn into an

07:36.400 --> 07:37.820
activate button.

07:37.840 --> 07:41.460
So go ahead and click the blue activate.

07:41.520 --> 07:44.100
That takes me back to my main plugin screen.

07:44.100 --> 07:48.380
And here we can see a message that reads plug in activated.

07:48.660 --> 07:50.520
OK so let's take it for a test drive.

07:50.610 --> 07:58.270
So if I use this link in my top bar switch back to my public facing web site and use my navigation to

07:58.270 --> 08:01.180
jump to my photo gallery page.

08:01.180 --> 08:07.970
Now if I click on the elephant thumbnail here here we can see the large resolution copy of the photo

08:08.240 --> 08:11.600
only now I have this x in the top right corner.

08:11.750 --> 08:15.390
So if I click that it takes me right back to the photo gallery.

08:15.500 --> 08:21.140
So if I go back into the large version I can also push the escape key on my keyboard to go back to the

08:21.140 --> 08:22.030
gallery.

08:22.280 --> 08:27.470
And you'll also notice these arrows down at the bottom portion of the screen so I can click on this

08:27.470 --> 08:31.700
forward facing arrow to go to the next full resolution photo.

08:31.700 --> 08:32.870
You get the idea.

08:32.870 --> 08:35.390
You can also use the arrow keys on your keyboard

08:38.430 --> 08:38.880
pretty cool.

08:38.880 --> 08:42.590
So now users don't have to use the back button in their web browser.

08:42.750 --> 08:47.060
Instead they're presented with a nice light box pop up experience.

08:47.220 --> 08:52.670
And this particular plug in that we used is very flexible so we're free to customize it a bit.

08:52.980 --> 08:58.540
So if we use this link in my bar to jump back to my admin dashboard.

08:58.810 --> 09:05.380
And then in the sidebar look for plug ins again within this list of all of our installed plug ins we

09:05.380 --> 09:07.710
see a responsive light box down here.

09:07.840 --> 09:16.460
And if we click on this setting's link under responsive light box this first option here lets us customize

09:16.460 --> 09:19.540
the particular light box styling that gets used.

09:19.570 --> 09:24.310
So the current lightbox behavior that's getting used is called swipe box.

09:24.320 --> 09:27.770
But if we switch it to fancy box.

09:28.040 --> 09:29.410
So I checked that option.

09:29.660 --> 09:38.330
And then if I scroll down to the very bottom and click save changes we see this message settings saved.

09:38.330 --> 09:39.260
Perfect.

09:39.500 --> 09:45.140
Let's close that message and also let's close this message that says thank you for installing responsive

09:45.140 --> 09:50.300
light box so you can just use this X over on the right hand side to close that.

09:50.300 --> 09:56.380
All right and now that we switched from swipe box to fancy box let's go look at our public facing web

09:56.380 --> 09:58.850
site and see how that looks.

09:58.880 --> 10:03.070
So jump over to the photo gallery page and click on the elephants.

10:03.380 --> 10:06.520
And immediately we can see this is a different experience.

10:06.680 --> 10:12.440
So now the entire screen is it blacked out just to the left and right edges are sort of a transparent

10:12.440 --> 10:13.230
gray.

10:13.460 --> 10:17.430
And if I hover over the image we can see this right facing arrow array here.

10:18.830 --> 10:24.730
That lets me switch through the images if I hover over the left hand side of the image we have an arrow

10:24.730 --> 10:31.090
to go back this direction you get the idea and we can use the x ray here to close the light box.

10:31.420 --> 10:31.740
OK.

10:31.750 --> 10:36.430
So it's up to you to choose which specific light box option you want to use.

10:36.490 --> 10:43.540
But the important point here is that we just leverage the power of plug ins to create the exact photo

10:43.540 --> 10:46.160
gallery experience that we wanted.

10:46.180 --> 10:48.740
Now that will bring this lesson to a close.

10:48.820 --> 10:54.400
But I do want to let you know that there are plug ins for basically anything and everything you can

10:54.400 --> 10:55.410
think of.

10:55.690 --> 11:02.170
Ninety nine times out of 100 if you think of a feature in your mind for your web site someone has already

11:02.170 --> 11:08.020
created a WordPress plugin for it and odds are they've added it to that free list of plugins that we

11:08.020 --> 11:09.170
can search from.

11:09.400 --> 11:14.680
Now just to whet your appetite a bit I'll let you know that towards the end of this course when we work

11:14.680 --> 11:22.510
on the Contact Us page we will leverage several new plug ins to create a highly interactive contact

11:22.510 --> 11:23.580
page.

11:23.650 --> 11:28.210
So don't worry this is not the last time that we will talk about plug ins in this course.

11:28.210 --> 11:34.210
In fact even aside from the contact us lessons there are a few other moments where we will install and

11:34.210 --> 11:36.490
leverage additional plug ins.

11:36.550 --> 11:42.100
Now changing gears a bit in our next lesson we're going to jump back to blog posts.

11:42.100 --> 11:49.420
We're going to address one of the simplest but most powerful aspects of Wordpress I'm referring to categories

11:49.960 --> 11:52.770
categories will open so many new doors for us.

11:52.780 --> 11:54.210
It's going to be a lot of fun.

11:54.370 --> 11:55.720
Let's keep things rolling.

11:55.810 --> 11:58.430
And I will see you in the next lesson.
