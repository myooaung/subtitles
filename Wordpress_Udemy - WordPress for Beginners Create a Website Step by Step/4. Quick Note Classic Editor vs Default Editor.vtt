00:00.760 --> 00:02.170
Hello everyone.

00:02.170 --> 00:07.150
This is just a quick note before we jump into the actual next lesson.

00:07.150 --> 00:12.950
So it really quick I just want to talk about the classic Ed. versus the default editor.

00:13.150 --> 00:15.800
Let me show you what in the world I'm talking about.

00:16.090 --> 00:17.230
So here's my web site.

00:17.250 --> 00:25.010
And if I jump into the admin dashboard and if I begin creating a brand new post this screen that we

00:25.010 --> 00:31.560
see whenever we are creating a new page or post or editing an existing page or post we refer to the

00:31.560 --> 00:35.400
screen as the editor or the edit screen.

00:35.630 --> 00:41.630
Now in December of 2018 WordPress did something very controversial.

00:41.630 --> 00:49.810
They completely redesigned the edit screen meaning for the last decade up until December of 2018.

00:49.940 --> 00:53.630
This edit screen looked drastically different.

00:53.690 --> 00:59.190
Now some people love this new editor but some people really do not like it.

00:59.300 --> 01:02.870
And when I say some people I don't just mean a few loud angry people.

01:02.900 --> 01:07.530
I mean millions and millions of people do not like this new editor.

01:07.760 --> 01:09.320
Now this is not surprising.

01:09.380 --> 01:15.530
The official word press team knew that a lot of people would not like this Ed. They knew it would be

01:15.530 --> 01:17.390
a controversial decision.

01:17.390 --> 01:24.590
In fact if I switch over to the official Wordpress blog from the official WordPress Web site they posted

01:24.590 --> 01:30.470
this blog about the new update to the new editor and they have a section in the blog called Keep it

01:30.470 --> 01:31.630
classic.

01:31.910 --> 01:39.380
And it says that if you prefer to keep the older or classic editor they will keep supporting it through

01:39.380 --> 01:42.850
a plug in through 2021.

01:42.890 --> 01:49.170
So I'm assuming that means December 30th first of 2021 or January 1st of 2022.

01:49.400 --> 01:57.890
Either way that's several more years of people being able to use the older original or classic Ed. If

01:57.890 --> 01:59.110
they want to.

01:59.210 --> 02:06.050
Now a bit later on in this video lesson I'm going to show you how to enable the older classic Ed..

02:06.200 --> 02:12.330
But before we do that I want to show you the basics of the new or modern editor.

02:12.350 --> 02:12.590
Right.

02:12.590 --> 02:16.070
So this is the screen we've been using throughout the course so far.

02:16.160 --> 02:21.900
You can add a title here and then down here we add our content.

02:21.970 --> 02:24.530
So you can say this is content.

02:24.530 --> 02:27.440
Now here's the interesting thing about the new editor.

02:27.440 --> 02:34.040
If I push enter or return to create a new paragraph and say hello again.

02:34.250 --> 02:38.500
It actually creates separate blocks.

02:38.510 --> 02:41.270
That's the term that WordPress is using for each piece of content.

02:41.270 --> 02:47.670
Now a block now aside from paragraphs there are many different other types of blocks.

02:47.690 --> 02:54.500
So for example if I wanted to switch this from a paragraph to a larger headline I can click into that

02:54.500 --> 03:01.690
block and then while I'm hovering over it if I use this icon I can change the type of block so I could

03:01.690 --> 03:04.960
change it to a heading OK.

03:04.970 --> 03:10.850
And then aside from pushing enter or return to create a new block we can also use this icon towards

03:10.850 --> 03:12.910
the top left of the edit screen.

03:13.010 --> 03:19.790
This plus symbol we can use this to create a new block and then that will actually give us a menu of

03:19.820 --> 03:22.110
all of the different block types.

03:22.370 --> 03:29.090
So this would allow us to insert an image into the content of our post or a bulleted list or a large

03:29.090 --> 03:29.970
quote.

03:30.110 --> 03:36.440
Or if you wanted to embed a YouTube video into your content you can search here for the type of block

03:36.470 --> 03:37.580
you're interested in.

03:37.580 --> 03:43.550
So I can just say YouTube and then it'll show me the result I could click this and then it's as simple

03:43.550 --> 03:49.550
as just pasting in the RL of the YouTube video you want to include and then you would click embed and

03:49.550 --> 03:51.680
then it would show up in your content.

03:51.680 --> 03:54.170
So that's the new or modern editor.

03:54.170 --> 03:59.180
In a nutshell everything is a block and there are different types of blocks.

03:59.180 --> 04:00.730
BLOCK can be a paragraph.

04:00.740 --> 04:02.200
It can be a headline.

04:02.240 --> 04:03.550
It can be a photograph.

04:03.560 --> 04:09.140
It can be a YouTube video and then you're free to drag and rearrange the blocks.

04:09.140 --> 04:10.500
You get the idea.

04:10.520 --> 04:16.720
Now this new editor has only officially been a part of Wordpress since December of 2018.

04:17.030 --> 04:23.210
And I've gone ahead and rerecorded or refilled the first five or six lessons of the course to show the

04:23.210 --> 04:24.280
new editor.

04:24.320 --> 04:30.860
Now eventually it will make sense to rerecord the entire course using the modern editor but I don't

04:30.860 --> 04:39.550
think that time is now because there are still millions of people that prefer the older or classic editor

04:39.980 --> 04:46.970
and the official WordPress team themselves in their official blog post have noted that you can continue

04:46.970 --> 04:51.560
using the classic editor through the entire year of 2021.

04:51.560 --> 04:58.640
So as of right now I can let you know that the remainder of this course is going to use the older or

04:58.640 --> 05:00.360
classic editor.

05:00.440 --> 05:06.740
Now I don't want to come across as a traditionalist who is afraid of change or the future this new modern

05:06.740 --> 05:09.770
editor that we see here is definitely the way forward.

05:09.980 --> 05:15.860
However I do think that it's going to go through a bit of growing pains for the next six months to a

05:15.860 --> 05:16.700
year.

05:16.700 --> 05:21.680
It was just released by the Board press team and I think there's some big bugs and kinks that they need

05:21.680 --> 05:23.620
to work out of the system so.

05:23.630 --> 05:29.820
Eventually down the road this would be the editing experience that I wholeheartedly recommend.

05:30.020 --> 05:33.970
But I don't think we're there yet but that's just my opinion.

05:34.010 --> 05:38.030
If you want to use this new modern editor that's A-OK.

05:38.150 --> 05:40.770
I just want this issue to be on your radar.

05:40.790 --> 05:45.950
I want you to be aware of the fact that some people like the new editor a lot of people don't.

05:46.010 --> 05:50.190
And it's up to you to choose which editing experience you want to use.

05:50.330 --> 05:53.410
So at this point we've seen the new modern editor.

05:53.450 --> 05:58.200
Now I want to show you how to try out the older classic editor.

05:58.400 --> 06:04.670
So right now I want you to follow along with me within the left hand menu of the admin screen.

06:04.670 --> 06:10.660
Look for plugins it should be about the fifth or sixth link down in the menu.

06:10.790 --> 06:16.030
So plugins go ahead and click on that now don't worry in a future lesson.

06:16.060 --> 06:21.820
I will explain what a plug in is right now though I can let you know that you don't need to know what

06:21.820 --> 06:26.020
a plug in is in order to use the classic editing experience.

06:26.200 --> 06:29.640
So this screen shows us all of the plug ins that we currently have.

06:29.650 --> 06:36.430
We want to add a new one so we can either click add new up here at the top or we can click add new in

06:36.430 --> 06:37.350
the sidebar.

06:37.390 --> 06:39.990
That's nested under plug ins.

06:40.450 --> 06:43.830
So add new plug in from this add plug in screen.

06:43.840 --> 06:50.050
I'm going to use this search bar towards the top right and I want you to search for a plug in that is

06:50.050 --> 06:55.020
named classic editor.

06:55.120 --> 06:57.000
For me it is the first result.

06:57.010 --> 06:58.180
Classic Ed..

06:58.310 --> 07:03.580
You can see that it's created by the official WordPress team WordPress contributors.

07:03.580 --> 07:07.660
This means it is 100 percent legit safe and secure.

07:07.660 --> 07:14.130
This is not a plug in created by a random community member held up by duct tape and hacks.

07:14.140 --> 07:19.860
This is the official board press editor that has been a part of Wordpress for years and years.

07:20.070 --> 07:22.510
And you can see that at the time I'm recording this.

07:22.510 --> 07:28.610
It has the perfect five star rating and it is used on over a million different Web sites already.

07:28.810 --> 07:33.330
So go ahead and click the install now button for the classic editor.

07:34.640 --> 07:41.220
Give it a minute or two and as soon as it installs this button will now say activate instead of install

07:41.220 --> 07:41.470
now.

07:41.480 --> 07:44.390
So go ahead and click the Activate button.

07:45.860 --> 07:50.230
Ok and now let's go try to create a brand new blog post.

07:50.240 --> 07:59.080
So in the sidebar posts add new and you can see that this editing screen looks a bit different.

07:59.080 --> 08:03.670
This is the classic editor up until December of 2018.

08:03.790 --> 08:11.080
This is the general way that the word press editing screen looked for the past decade plus this is where

08:11.080 --> 08:12.580
you add your title.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.310
Hello world.

08:14.710 --> 08:19.930
And this is where you add your content and you can see that this resembles a word processing document

08:20.050 --> 08:21.180
so you can type.

08:21.190 --> 08:22.860
Here is a bit of content.

08:23.260 --> 08:25.620
And there's just one big large field.

08:25.840 --> 08:32.220
Everything does not get broken up into its own separate block if you want to make something bold.

08:32.220 --> 08:37.540
You just highlight it you can click the bold or italic icon if you want to change something to a headline

08:37.540 --> 08:43.300
you could just select this and then choose this instead of paragraph making a heading level 2.

08:43.300 --> 08:48.640
Now I'm not going to show every feature of the classic editor right now because that's what we're going

08:48.640 --> 08:54.250
to learn throughout the remainder of this course in future lessons we will learn how to add a photograph

08:54.250 --> 08:58.950
into our content how do embed YouTube video and much more.

08:58.960 --> 09:05.180
So I strongly encourage you to use this classic ed. with me throughout the remainder of the course.

09:05.290 --> 09:09.400
But I don't want you to feel completely locked into the classic editor.

09:09.490 --> 09:14.930
I think it would be a good idea to use it throughout this course so that we are on the same page.

09:14.980 --> 09:21.220
And then once you are familiar with wordpress as a whole you'll be in a much better position to make

09:21.340 --> 09:26.860
an educated decision and then you can decide which editing experience you prefer.

09:26.860 --> 09:33.070
With that in mind really quick I want to show you how you would disable the classic editor and go back

09:33.070 --> 09:34.620
to the modern editor.

09:34.900 --> 09:39.780
So in the left hand side bar look for plug ins again click on plug ins.

09:39.820 --> 09:42.780
This screen shows you all the plug ins you currently have.

09:42.940 --> 09:45.050
Look for classic Ed..

09:45.280 --> 09:52.460
And then just click the Deactivate button right below its title once it's deactivated your Wordpress

09:52.560 --> 09:55.810
will use the new modern editor once again.

09:55.950 --> 09:59.710
So you can just activate and deactivate and switch back and forth.

09:59.760 --> 10:01.700
However often you want.

10:01.710 --> 10:08.910
The decision is up to you but just know that I am going to use the classic editor in the upcoming video

10:08.910 --> 10:10.160
lessons.

10:10.200 --> 10:15.090
I feel that it's easier to use and it's just more intuitive for the majority of people.

10:15.270 --> 10:19.170
And apparently it seems like millions of others agree with that sentiment.

10:19.170 --> 10:25.410
Hopefully down the road maybe six months to a year from now the modern editor gets a few improvements

10:25.410 --> 10:31.310
or changes made to it and it becomes the unanimous optimum editing experience.

10:31.350 --> 10:37.440
I do know that the classic editor will be officially supported by WordPress at least until the very

10:37.440 --> 10:39.020
end of 2021.

10:39.270 --> 10:42.810
It's going to be interesting to see how this whole issue plays out.

10:42.810 --> 10:47.970
I think you're fine either way whichever editing experience you choose let's keep rolling through these

10:47.970 --> 10:48.560
lessons.

10:48.570 --> 10:53.860
We are going to be using the Classic get in there and I will see you in the next lesson.
