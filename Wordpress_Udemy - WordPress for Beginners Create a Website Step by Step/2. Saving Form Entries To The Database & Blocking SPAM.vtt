00:01.030 --> 00:08.560
Hello everyone in this lesson we will finish up the Contact Us page by making two big improvements to

00:08.560 --> 00:10.030
the contact form.

00:10.150 --> 00:16.460
First we will learn how to save the submissions from the contact form into the Wordpress database.

00:16.570 --> 00:23.050
So that way we can always view a copy of all visitors submissions from within our admin dashboard instead

00:23.050 --> 00:27.530
of having to rely solely on the emails that get automatically sent to us.

00:27.700 --> 00:34.690
And after that we will finish up the lesson by learning how to protect our contact form from spam bots.

00:34.840 --> 00:37.650
Without further ado let's start with our first goal.

00:37.780 --> 00:42.940
Let's learn how to save the contact form submissions into the Wordpress database.

00:43.160 --> 00:49.900
OK so here I am on the home page of my web site and if I use the navigation menu to jump to the Contact

00:49.900 --> 00:51.010
Us page.

00:51.130 --> 00:57.460
Currently as of this moment if a visitor fills out this contact form and hits send.

00:57.610 --> 01:03.520
Behind the scenes WordPress will send an email to the owner of this web site with all of the data that

01:03.520 --> 01:06.070
the visitor input and that can be great.

01:06.070 --> 01:11.280
We all know that email is very convenient but email is not perfect right.

01:11.320 --> 01:17.350
Sometimes you might accidentally delete an email or your inbox might become super crowded and it can

01:17.350 --> 01:19.760
become difficult to stay organized.

01:19.960 --> 01:27.250
So our goal right now is to customize this contact form so that in addition to sending us an email it

01:27.250 --> 01:34.510
also saves the users data into the Wordpress database so that way instead of relying 100 percent on

01:34.510 --> 01:41.260
our email we can always just jump into the admin dashboard and see a convenient organized list of all

01:41.260 --> 01:43.240
contact forms submissions.

01:43.390 --> 01:47.730
Now out of the box Wordpress and the contact form 7 plug in.

01:47.830 --> 01:54.370
Do not offer that functionality but surprise surprise plugins can save the day.

01:54.430 --> 01:59.260
So lets go and install a plugin that will give us the exact behavior that we want.

01:59.260 --> 02:06.410
So let's jump over to our admin dashboard from the sidebar let's click on plug ins.

02:06.490 --> 02:09.560
We want to search for and install a new plug in.

02:09.640 --> 02:13.970
So up here click on the Add New button.

02:14.160 --> 02:19.900
Let's use this top right search field and I can tell you that the plugin we are looking for that will

02:19.900 --> 02:24.240
allow us to save contact form submissions into the database.

02:24.280 --> 02:28.470
The best plug in to get that job done is named flamingo.

02:28.540 --> 02:33.390
So let's search for flow Mingo.

02:33.440 --> 02:33.980
Here it is.

02:33.980 --> 02:40.840
The first result it has over hundred thousand active installs and a solid four and a half star rating.

02:41.060 --> 02:46.820
So let's go ahead and click the install Now button once that completes.

02:46.820 --> 02:54.600
Then click activate and with that new plug in activated if we look in our left hand sidebar we see a

02:54.600 --> 02:58.110
new item named flamingo.

02:58.110 --> 03:00.810
Go ahead and click on Flamingo now.

03:00.870 --> 03:03.970
In my opinion this screen is not very useful.

03:04.080 --> 03:11.130
So this Flamingo address book screen lives up to its name and it simply shows you a list with people's

03:11.130 --> 03:12.880
name and email address.

03:12.900 --> 03:18.420
And these are all of the people that have either left a comment on our blog posts or have filled out

03:18.420 --> 03:19.830
our contact form.

03:20.010 --> 03:23.810
Again I don't find the screen to be particularly useful.

03:23.820 --> 03:27.900
The real power of Flamengo is located on another screen.

03:28.010 --> 03:32.490
So in the left hand side bar under the main Flamengo menu.

03:32.490 --> 03:40.050
In addition the address book we also see a link named inbound messages and that screen is what makes

03:40.050 --> 03:42.030
Flamengo so powerful.

03:42.150 --> 03:44.870
So go ahead and click on inbound messages.

03:45.210 --> 03:49.480
And from this screen at the moment we see no items found.

03:49.680 --> 03:55.680
And that's because we haven't had any contact form submissions take place since we just installed this

03:55.680 --> 03:57.030
Flamingo plug in.

03:57.150 --> 04:00.000
So let's give the Flamingo plug in a test.

04:00.000 --> 04:06.660
Let's jump over to the front end of our website and submit a test or sample contact form submission

04:07.280 --> 04:10.780
so I will jump to the contact us page.

04:10.800 --> 04:11.760
Scroll down.

04:11.760 --> 04:13.230
Let me fill this form out.

04:18.690 --> 04:23.260
Click send thank you for your message it has been sent.

04:23.280 --> 04:29.760
But more importantly if we jump back to the admin dashboard and you can either refresh the screen or

04:29.760 --> 04:36.460
to get to the screen in the first place under the Flamingo sidebar menu click on inbound messages.

04:36.660 --> 04:40.470
And here we see that contact form submission that we just created.

04:40.470 --> 04:46.200
Now behind the scenes I did just receive an e-mail with this information but like we mentioned earlier

04:46.260 --> 04:49.060
e-mail isn't always the ideal solution.

04:49.080 --> 04:54.240
So now we have another copy of that contact form submission right here so I can go ahead and click on

04:54.240 --> 04:58.010
the subject line to view the full form submission.

04:58.230 --> 04:59.740
And now we get all of the info.

04:59.760 --> 05:03.970
So not only their name and email but we can see what they're interested in.

05:03.990 --> 05:07.070
So graphic design and we can see their body message.

05:07.080 --> 05:08.550
The sky is blue today.

05:08.670 --> 05:10.030
Perfect.

05:10.200 --> 05:15.750
And really that's all there is to the Flamingo plugin from this moment forward you will now always have

05:15.750 --> 05:21.940
a universal convenient location to read and review all of your contact form submissions.

05:22.060 --> 05:22.500
OK.

05:22.500 --> 05:25.880
So we just completed our first goal for this lesson.

05:25.890 --> 05:32.070
Now let's change gears and work on protecting our contact form from spam box.

05:32.070 --> 05:36.960
Let me jump back to the front end of my web site so I can let you know what I'm talking about so I'm

05:36.960 --> 05:38.220
sure you've seen this before.

05:38.280 --> 05:43.770
You're on a Web site and you're trying to fill out a form and a lot of the fields look normal but then

05:43.770 --> 05:49.890
you'll see a field where it asks you to solve a riddle or to type in a few words that look really distorted

05:49.890 --> 05:51.750
and twisted up and hard to read.

05:51.750 --> 05:57.120
The reason web sites make you fill out weird fields like that is to prove that you're not a robot to

05:57.120 --> 06:02.610
prove that you're not a spam bot to prove that you're just an innocent human being trying to legitimately

06:02.610 --> 06:03.870
use the form.

06:03.990 --> 06:10.540
Those types of fields that present a riddle or some type of question are often referred to as a capture.

06:10.740 --> 06:18.360
So our goal right now is to add a caption field to our contact form so that only humans and not spam

06:18.360 --> 06:23.640
bots will be successful when they try to submit or send this contact form.

06:23.670 --> 06:30.690
Now luckily for us the contact form seven plug in that we are using makes it very easy to implement

06:30.690 --> 06:32.020
a capture field.

06:32.250 --> 06:33.340
So check this out.

06:33.360 --> 06:42.000
Back in our admin dashboard in the left hand side bar hover over the contact option and within the contact

06:42.000 --> 06:47.710
menu that appears click on integration OK.

06:47.710 --> 06:55.150
So here we see something called recaptcha recaptcha is one of the best spam bot protection captious

06:55.150 --> 06:57.250
services in the world.

06:57.250 --> 07:03.820
It's a free service created by Google and all we need to do is go to the Google recapture website and

07:03.820 --> 07:05.610
sign up for a free account.

07:05.620 --> 07:10.420
Actually we don't really need to sign up for anything because you can just log in with your existing

07:10.420 --> 07:15.900
Google or gmail account and then you will be just one click away from using recaptcha.

07:16.090 --> 07:17.770
OK so here's what you need to do.

07:17.770 --> 07:23.730
Open a new tab in your web browser or a new window in your web browser and go to Google dot com.

07:23.800 --> 07:32.000
And then I want you to search for Google recaptcha So Google recaptcha.

07:32.170 --> 07:34.130
This should be the first or second result.

07:34.210 --> 07:39.520
Basically we're just looking for Google dot com forward slash recaptcha.

07:39.520 --> 07:45.200
So click on any link that begins with that you Arel and then we're going to click on this button towards

07:45.200 --> 07:51.630
the top right that reads get recaptcha.

07:51.640 --> 07:57.040
Now it's important to note that you do need a Google account in order to use recaptcha.

07:57.130 --> 08:00.160
Most people already have a Google account.

08:00.160 --> 08:07.150
So if you've ever used Gmail or YouTube or Google Drive or Google Docs you already have a Google account.

08:07.360 --> 08:12.250
So just be sure that you're signed into your Google account in your web browser and then you'll be able

08:12.250 --> 08:14.050
to follow along with these steps.

08:14.080 --> 08:15.110
No problem.

08:15.280 --> 08:20.120
OK so I'm currently signed into my Google account so I'm free to fill out this form.

08:20.290 --> 08:24.400
So for the label it doesn't really matter we can type anything we want here.

08:24.490 --> 08:26.370
I will just type the name of my website.

08:26.380 --> 08:28.820
So learning WordPress.

08:29.080 --> 08:34.730
And just to stay organized I will say contact form page again.

08:34.750 --> 08:38.580
It doesn't really matter what we type here it's just for your own organization.

08:38.650 --> 08:41.150
And then this field is important.

08:41.380 --> 08:48.160
So in this field I want you to type in or copy and paste in the domain of your Wordpress Web site.

08:48.310 --> 08:50.530
So let's use my web site as an example.

08:50.530 --> 08:55.800
So back in this tab we can see that my web site lives at Bradd ass.

08:55.840 --> 09:02.990
One dot S-G you remember I'm using site ground for my web site dot site.

09:03.010 --> 09:07.190
Now the rest of this you Arel is just specific to the page I'm currently viewing.

09:07.270 --> 09:12.430
Right so I'm in the Wordpress admin dashboard etc. etc. but that's not important.

09:12.430 --> 09:17.490
Google just wants the domain name and only this beginning part is the domain.

09:17.560 --> 09:20.930
So if you're like me and you're using site ground it will just be your name.

09:21.010 --> 09:26.250
As GED you dot site or if you're using your own custom dot com or dot org.

09:26.360 --> 09:32.170
We're just interested in the root domain of your web site so I'm going to copy this part of the RL into

09:32.170 --> 09:37.660
my clipboard and then back in the Google recaptcha tab.

09:37.660 --> 09:44.980
I will just paste that into this field and I'm actually going to remove the HTP colon slash slash at

09:44.980 --> 09:49.180
the beginning and I will also remove the slash at the end.

09:49.360 --> 09:55.720
OK so now it's literally just my domain and then go ahead and click this blue register button.

09:56.880 --> 09:57.880
All right perfect.

09:57.900 --> 09:58.920
Now from this screen.

09:58.930 --> 10:01.430
We're interested in this area.

10:01.770 --> 10:07.160
So here we have two things a site key and a secret key.

10:07.170 --> 10:10.590
Now I've blacked out my keys just for security reasons.

10:10.680 --> 10:13.670
But you will have your own unique key values here.

10:13.890 --> 10:18.290
And now we just need to plug in these key values into the contact form plug in.

10:18.480 --> 10:25.800
So right now within this first one the site key area within this box go ahead and select and copy your

10:25.800 --> 10:31.800
site key value copy it in your clipboard and then jump back to the browser tab or window where you still

10:31.800 --> 10:34.590
have the Wordpress admin dashboard open.

10:34.680 --> 10:40.620
If you can't remember how I got to this current screen just look in your left hand side bar for contact

10:40.860 --> 10:44.410
and within the contact sub menu click on integration.

10:44.600 --> 10:50.270
OK and now that we've generated our own recaptcha keys we can just go ahead and click on this configure

10:50.280 --> 10:52.260
key button.

10:52.290 --> 10:54.040
Here we see two fields.

10:54.150 --> 10:56.970
So the site key should already be in your clipboard.

10:56.970 --> 10:58.420
Remember you just copied it.

10:58.470 --> 11:00.440
So go ahead and paste that in.

11:00.660 --> 11:03.580
And finally we just need to enter our secret key.

11:03.750 --> 11:09.700
So jump back to the recaptcha tab and right here you should see your secret key value.

11:09.810 --> 11:15.810
So select that and then copy it to your clipboard then jump back into the Wordpress screen and paste

11:15.810 --> 11:17.880
it into the secret key field.

11:17.880 --> 11:20.620
Once you've done that then click the save button.

11:22.570 --> 11:28.920
All right and now we're just one step away from having the capture field appear on our contact form.

11:28.960 --> 11:33.670
Our final step is to edit the contact form to the left hand side bar.

11:33.670 --> 11:40.590
Click on the main top level contact button at the moment we only have the one form.

11:40.600 --> 11:42.080
So go ahead and click on that.

11:42.090 --> 11:49.070
Edit it and now within this area we just need to place our cursor where we want the caption field to

11:49.070 --> 11:49.770
appear.

11:49.880 --> 11:55.490
It's totally up to you but personally I'm going to add the caption in between the your message and the

11:55.490 --> 11:57.340
final submit button.

11:57.410 --> 12:03.530
So I will place my cursor right about here and now we can use these buttons up here and look for one

12:03.530 --> 12:05.140
named recaptcha.

12:05.360 --> 12:07.400
So here it is towards the right hand side.

12:07.410 --> 12:12.290
Recaptcha go ahead and click on that within this pop up screen.

12:12.300 --> 12:18.030
We can leave all of the options set to their default value and just go ahead and click this insert tag

12:18.030 --> 12:26.080
button down here and really all that did was add a short code right here where cursor was named recaptcha.

12:26.160 --> 12:28.780
So technically you couldn't just type that in by hand.

12:28.890 --> 12:33.090
But either way with this in place let's go ahead and save our form.

12:33.090 --> 12:39.970
So in the right hand sidebar click the blue save button and now if we jump back to the front end of

12:39.970 --> 12:48.960
our Web site and refresh the contact us page we scroll down a bit here we see that caption field.

12:49.070 --> 12:55.010
Now because I'm currently logged into my Google account in this web browser the Google recaptures service

12:55.070 --> 12:56.970
already sort of trusts me.

12:57.020 --> 13:04.090
So if I click this I'm not a robot link it gives me the green success checkmark and it sort of just

13:04.090 --> 13:06.560
takes my word for it that I'm not a robot.

13:06.580 --> 13:11.160
And again that's because I'm already signed into my Google account on this browser.

13:11.170 --> 13:16.330
However what if a random stranger visits our Web site and tries to use our contact form.

13:16.360 --> 13:19.200
So I'm currently using Google Chrome as my web browser.

13:19.330 --> 13:21.770
But if I open up Mozilla Firefox.

13:21.850 --> 13:27.640
So in this browser window I'm just a random stranger visiting this Web site and if I go to the contact

13:27.640 --> 13:34.470
page and scroll down here we see the caption field.

13:34.470 --> 13:36.170
Only this time if I click.

13:36.210 --> 13:37.440
I'm not a robot.

13:39.370 --> 13:43.620
The recaptures service is going to make me prove that I'm not a robot.

13:43.630 --> 13:49.540
So here we see it gives us a little test or a quiz or a riddle that says Select all squares with street

13:49.540 --> 13:50.590
signs.

13:50.740 --> 13:58.330
So I will click this square in this square and then click next Caig then select all squares with street

13:58.330 --> 13:58.960
signs.

13:58.990 --> 14:06.290
So I will click here here here here here here you get the idea and then click verify.

14:07.600 --> 14:08.430
Ok cool.

14:08.470 --> 14:14.350
So I passed the test and now that I passed that test and Google recaptcha knows that I'm not a spam

14:14.350 --> 14:14.920
bot.

14:15.160 --> 14:18.040
I'm free to fill out this form and submit it.

14:18.280 --> 14:24.580
But if someone comes to our website and tries to fill out the form before completing the recapture test

14:24.790 --> 14:27.070
they will not be able to submit the form.

14:27.190 --> 14:33.550
So let's try that really quick if I refresh this page and scroll down and if I purposely leave this

14:33.640 --> 14:43.010
unchecked and I don't complete the quiz just fill this out subject test message test and I click send.

14:44.030 --> 14:45.340
We see this error message.

14:45.350 --> 14:48.270
Please verify that you are not a robot.

14:48.290 --> 14:49.120
Perfect.

14:49.130 --> 14:55.400
So we have successfully protected our contact form from evil spam robots.

14:55.400 --> 15:01.910
And that's actually going to bring this lesson and this section on creating a contact page to a close

15:02.360 --> 15:09.200
in our next lesson we will learn about some of the most important WordPress settings customizing WordPress

15:09.200 --> 15:12.320
settings will let you create additional user accounts.

15:12.410 --> 15:18.160
So in addition to your main admin account you could create additional accounts for friends or family

15:18.160 --> 15:21.700
or coworkers so they can help you manage the Web site.

15:21.710 --> 15:23.210
It should be a lot of fun.

15:23.300 --> 15:27.500
Let's keep things rolling and I will see you in the next lesson.
