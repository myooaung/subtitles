00:01.020 --> 00:06.330
Hello everyone in this lesson we will learn about widgets.

00:06.330 --> 00:10.710
The natural question here is what in the world is a widget.

00:10.960 --> 00:18.120
Well here we are on the home page of my web site and I can tell you that this right hand side bar is

00:18.120 --> 00:21.570
comprised or made up of widgets.

00:21.570 --> 00:27.410
So for example this search section where visitors can search for certain content on my website.

00:27.420 --> 00:29.760
This is a search widget.

00:29.760 --> 00:34.650
This recent post area or section is a recent posts widget.

00:34.980 --> 00:36.190
Scroll down a bit.

00:36.270 --> 00:40.760
This recent comments area is a widget is archive's area is a widget.

00:40.800 --> 00:41.980
You get the idea.

00:42.000 --> 00:47.810
Now the nice thing about widgets is that we can drag and drop and reorder them and customize them.

00:48.120 --> 00:55.770
So for example maybe I want this recent posts widget to sit above the search widget or maybe I want

00:55.770 --> 00:59.760
to remove one of the widgets entirely or add a new widget.

00:59.760 --> 01:04.670
You get the idea and wordpress makes it very simple to manage our widgets.

01:04.710 --> 01:05.800
So check this out.

01:05.910 --> 01:13.230
If we jump over to our admin dashboard and in the sidebar if we look under the appearance pop out menu

01:13.500 --> 01:17.030
we can then click on widgets.

01:17.110 --> 01:22.390
All right now from this screen the first thing I want to draw your attention to is this area.

01:22.600 --> 01:25.370
This box that is labeled sidebar.

01:25.510 --> 01:31.390
So all of these items correspond with the widgets that live in our web sites sidebar area.

01:31.390 --> 01:36.940
So for example if I open up the front end of my web site again remember that the search widget came

01:36.940 --> 01:39.830
first and then the recent posts widget.

01:40.150 --> 01:46.830
But if I want the recent post widget to be on top and come first within this widget screen I can just

01:46.830 --> 01:55.680
click and drag recent posts to sit up at the top and if I go and refreshed my website that change took

01:55.680 --> 01:58.560
effect lets try another example.

01:58.710 --> 02:04.450
So maybe I want to remove this recent comments widget from my sidebar altogether.

02:04.680 --> 02:09.090
So back in my widget screen here is recent comments.

02:09.090 --> 02:17.930
So if I click on that this menu area appears and now I can just click on this delete link and if I switch

02:17.930 --> 02:21.260
back to my front facing web site Cure's recent comments.

02:21.260 --> 02:26.680
But as soon as a refresh the page you can see that it's gone.

02:26.680 --> 02:27.370
Perfect.

02:27.370 --> 02:28.890
Now let's try something new.

02:29.050 --> 02:36.490
So maybe for this recent posts widget area maybe instead of recent posts I want to rename it to latest

02:36.490 --> 02:37.640
posts.

02:37.660 --> 02:44.310
So back in my admin dashboard within my widget screen here is that recent posts widget or section.

02:44.440 --> 02:50.840
So if I click on it we see that there is a title field and I can type whatever I want here.

02:51.170 --> 02:54.490
So I will say the latest entries.

02:54.770 --> 03:01.400
But obviously you could type whatever you want and then just click this blue save button ok and now

03:01.400 --> 03:05.770
as soon as we go back to the front facing website and refresh.

03:06.080 --> 03:08.160
Here we see that change.

03:08.360 --> 03:14.360
All right now let's jump back to our admin dashboard because you might be wondering what this half of

03:14.360 --> 03:15.790
the screen is.

03:15.800 --> 03:22.520
This area is titled available widgets so we can choose from any of these widgets and if we see one that

03:22.520 --> 03:27.140
we like we can just drag and drop it into our Sidebar area.

03:27.200 --> 03:30.430
So for example this calendar widget sounds interesting.

03:30.620 --> 03:39.490
So if I click on it and then drag it over to my side bar area that placed it here but maybe I want to

03:39.490 --> 03:44.960
be the first widget in my sidebar so I can just click and drag it to move it up to the top.

03:45.020 --> 03:50.980
And now if I jump back to my front facing website and refresh at the very top of my sidebar is this

03:51.020 --> 03:52.410
neat calendar.

03:52.570 --> 03:58.570
Now I haven't been creating very many new blog posts on this website but on the days where you have

03:58.570 --> 04:04.390
created a post it will light up so the tent is lit up because I posted on the tent and if I click on

04:04.390 --> 04:10.360
that it takes me to an archive for just that day February 10.

04:10.700 --> 04:15.880
So on that day I created Greek salad and homemade french bread you get the idea.

04:16.040 --> 04:18.260
So this counter widget is pretty neat.

04:18.500 --> 04:24.550
Let's jump back to my admin dashboard and let's practice adding another widget to the sidebar.

04:24.800 --> 04:31.580
So again this area contains all of the widgets that I can choose from but these widgets won't actually

04:31.580 --> 04:38.510
be created and added to my website until I add them into this sidebar area so I can choose from any

04:38.510 --> 04:39.430
of these.

04:39.500 --> 04:48.870
I will try out this text widget so if I just click and drag the text box into the sidebar area it gives

04:48.870 --> 04:56.160
me a few fields to fill out so title and content this text widget is pretty nice because it's very flexible

04:56.250 --> 05:00.330
so the text widget doesn't do anything on its own or automatically.

05:00.330 --> 05:07.800
It just gives us a blank canvas or a blank area where we can type so I can give this a title of hello

05:07.800 --> 05:09.050
world.

05:09.390 --> 05:15.300
And for the Continent I will say this is a bit of sample text.

05:15.300 --> 05:17.030
Thanks for reading.

05:17.270 --> 05:24.040
Okay and now I will just click this blue save button and if I jump back to my front facing website and

05:24.040 --> 05:27.230
refresh here is that text widget.

05:27.760 --> 05:28.120
All right.

05:28.120 --> 05:34.690
Next I want to change gears a bit and I want to let you know that widgets are not limited to just your

05:34.710 --> 05:37.390
sidebar or just this side column.

05:37.660 --> 05:38.440
So check this out.

05:38.440 --> 05:45.030
If we jump back to the admin dashboard Here's the sidebar widget area that we've been customizing but

05:45.060 --> 05:50.980
you will notice that I also have content bottom one and content bottom two.

05:51.050 --> 05:53.350
Now every theme is different.

05:53.350 --> 06:01.600
So I'm using the 2016 theme and it has widget areas named sidebar content bottom one content bottom

06:01.600 --> 06:02.100
two.

06:02.350 --> 06:08.980
But if you're using a different theme it will likely have different widget area names but the same concepts

06:08.980 --> 06:09.680
apply.

06:09.820 --> 06:10.930
So check this out.

06:11.020 --> 06:16.630
If I click on this content bottom one again yours might be named something different if you're using

06:16.630 --> 06:17.840
a different theme.

06:17.920 --> 06:23.100
But once I click on it now I can drag widgets into this area.

06:23.590 --> 06:31.150
So for example let me drag another text widget into this content bottom one area and for the title I

06:31.150 --> 06:40.170
will say testing the text widget again and for the content I will just say hello world one to three.

06:40.210 --> 06:41.740
The sky is blue.

06:42.500 --> 06:49.920
All right now if I click save and then jump back to my front facing web site and refresh and scroll

06:49.920 --> 06:54.300
down to the very bottom here we see that new widget.

06:54.300 --> 07:02.070
Now again every theme is different but in my theme content bottom one corresponds with this bottom area

07:02.100 --> 07:03.150
of my theme.

07:03.390 --> 07:08.850
Let's try it out a widget to this content bottom to area so I will click on it.

07:09.150 --> 07:14.670
And even though I already have a search widget in my sidebar Why don't I just experiment and click and

07:14.670 --> 07:16.760
drag search into content.

07:16.760 --> 07:22.680
Bottom two the idea here is that you can experiment with any of the widgets so feel free to drag and

07:22.680 --> 07:25.820
drop any widgets into any of your widget areas.

07:25.950 --> 07:30.590
But once I click save and then refresh my website here we see it.

07:30.600 --> 07:38.220
So within this particular theme of 2016 this area is content bottom one and just a moment ago it was

07:38.220 --> 07:40.120
taking up this full width.

07:40.230 --> 07:46.740
But as soon as we added the widget to the content bottom to area now they sit side by side each taking

07:46.740 --> 07:49.470
up half of this available with.

07:49.680 --> 07:53.060
So feel free to experiment with different themes.

07:53.220 --> 08:00.720
This theme I'm using has three widget areas or different areas in the page layout that I can customize

08:00.720 --> 08:06.660
with widgets but some themes might have four or five or 10 widget areas.

08:06.660 --> 08:10.750
Other themes might only have one sidebar widget area.

08:10.980 --> 08:14.860
Now remember there are thousands of free themes to choose from.

08:14.910 --> 08:18.560
So it's up to you to experiment and find the right thing for you.

08:18.570 --> 08:24.810
It has enough widget flexibility to meet your needs just to give you a real world example.

08:24.810 --> 08:31.150
Other themes might have a widget area named header and maybe you could add widgets appear in the header

08:31.620 --> 08:32.800
so you get the idea.

08:33.000 --> 08:39.160
Every theme is different and everything has different widget areas but the key point is that anywhere

08:39.210 --> 08:42.930
there is a widget area you have complete control over it.

08:42.930 --> 08:48.870
Now let's change gears a little bit and jump back to the ad then dashboard because there's one last

08:48.870 --> 08:52.940
super important feature when it comes to widgets that I want to let you know about.

08:53.220 --> 09:00.010
So we are not limited to just these widgets that we see right here under the available widgets area.

09:00.120 --> 09:05.940
While it is true that these are the only available widgets that WordPress ships with out of the box

09:06.170 --> 09:09.570
remember there is a little thing called plug ins.

09:09.570 --> 09:16.770
We can search for and download and install new plug ins that will give us access to new widgets that

09:16.770 --> 09:19.810
we can drag and drop into our widget areas.

09:20.130 --> 09:21.920
So lets try that right now.

09:21.930 --> 09:25.680
First let's give ourselves an example goal or task.

09:25.710 --> 09:31.590
So within my sidebar widget area here we can see that we currently have a widget named categories that

09:31.590 --> 09:32.610
we are using.

09:32.880 --> 09:38.580
And if we jump over to my Web site here is that category's widget and we can see that all it does is

09:38.580 --> 09:42.560
list out all of the categories on my website.

09:42.720 --> 09:49.830
So lets give ourselves a goal let's remove this categories widget and replace it with an area titled

09:50.070 --> 09:54.170
latest recipe posts or newest recipes.

09:54.240 --> 10:00.480
Right so I want a widget that can display maybe the most recent two or three or five blog posts from

10:00.480 --> 10:02.140
a particular category.

10:02.220 --> 10:07.440
In this case maybe I want to display the most recent posts from the recipe's category.

10:07.440 --> 10:12.870
Now the default built in wordpress categories which it cannot do that for us.

10:12.960 --> 10:20.250
So lets go ahead and delete this categories widget from my side bar so I will click on it and then click

10:20.250 --> 10:21.080
delete.

10:22.550 --> 10:29.540
And now what we are going to need to do is download and install a plugin that can offer us that type

10:29.540 --> 10:30.540
of functionality.

10:30.560 --> 10:37.070
The ability to display the most recent posts from a certain category in a widget so I know that I need

10:37.070 --> 10:40.140
to search for and install a new plugin.

10:40.220 --> 10:43.780
So in my left hand side bar here we see plugins.

10:43.790 --> 10:48.910
Lets go ahead and click on that from this main plugin screen.

10:48.930 --> 10:56.310
Let's click on this add new button and then within this top right search field.

10:56.340 --> 11:02.110
Let's search for category posts.

11:02.460 --> 11:08.040
Now you are free to choose your own plugin but I know from personal experience that this first one is

11:08.040 --> 11:12.420
a great solution so it's named category posts widget.

11:12.490 --> 11:14.210
It's by Tip-Top press.

11:14.250 --> 11:19.930
And as of this moment it has about eighty thousand or more active installs.

11:19.950 --> 11:23.790
I want to use this plugin so I will click this install now button.

11:25.490 --> 11:31.090
Once the install completes we can then click this blue activate button.

11:31.120 --> 11:31.660
All right.

11:31.660 --> 11:35.520
Looking good we see this plug in activated message here.

11:35.680 --> 11:42.520
So now if we jump back to our widgets screen so in the left hand side bar hover over appearance and

11:42.520 --> 11:49.240
then the pop up menu click on widgets and thanks to that new plug in we just installed.

11:49.340 --> 11:56.580
Now with this available widgets area we have this brand new category posts widget that we can use.

11:56.990 --> 12:00.950
So let's click and drag this into our Sidebar widget area.

12:02.280 --> 12:07.830
And every widget is different but I'm assuming we can just click on these different fields to customize

12:07.830 --> 12:08.620
the widget.

12:08.910 --> 12:17.110
So if we click on this first one named title let's give it a title of latest recipes.

12:17.110 --> 12:20.480
All right let's click on this next field named filter.

12:20.950 --> 12:25.390
So for category let's choose only the recipes category.

12:26.860 --> 12:29.120
Number of posts to show.

12:29.260 --> 12:35.260
Let's set it from 10 down to 5 so it will only show the five most recent recipes.

12:36.730 --> 12:41.890
And it looks like there are several other options we could customize but I don't think we need to at

12:41.890 --> 12:49.610
this moment so I'm just going to scroll down and click the blue save button and now if I jump back to

12:49.610 --> 12:57.900
my front facing web site and refresh and scroll up a bit here we see that new widget latest recipe is

12:58.160 --> 12:58.670
perfect.

12:58.670 --> 13:00.500
Now there's only three instead of five.

13:00.500 --> 13:07.560
And that's because I only have three posts under the recipes category but obviously if I had more to

13:07.650 --> 13:10.360
plug in would limit it to the most recent five.

13:10.610 --> 13:16.340
And now our visitors can just click on any one of these to be taken to that post.

13:16.340 --> 13:21.880
All right let's change gears again and try a new example let's give ourselves a new goal.

13:22.040 --> 13:28.850
So let's imagine we want to add a widget to our sidebar that displays icons or links to all of the social

13:28.850 --> 13:31.000
media networks that we belong to.

13:31.190 --> 13:35.570
So Facebook Twitter Pinterest YouTube you get the idea.

13:35.660 --> 13:42.020
WordPress does not come with a widget like that out of the box but we can go search for and install

13:42.020 --> 13:44.310
a new plug in to get the job done.

13:44.480 --> 13:47.270
So let's jump over to our admin dashboard.

13:47.350 --> 13:48.940
We are going to need a new plug in.

13:48.950 --> 13:52.340
So in the left hand side bar click on plug ins.

13:53.550 --> 14:01.590
From this main plug in screen click the Add New button within this top right search field.

14:01.590 --> 14:07.470
Let's search for simple social icons.

14:09.330 --> 14:14.130
All right now you might be wondering how in the world you're supposed to know what to search for because

14:14.130 --> 14:19.680
in the real world there won't always be someone in a video telling you exactly what to search for well

14:19.680 --> 14:24.180
over time you will become familiar with different plug ins that you've used again and again and you

14:24.180 --> 14:26.360
know that their quality solutions.

14:26.460 --> 14:31.650
But in the beginning when you're just starting out you're going to want to rely on word of mouth and

14:31.680 --> 14:38.730
oftentimes just googling for best WordPress plugin for and then include a few keywords of what you're

14:38.730 --> 14:40.080
trying to achieve.

14:40.080 --> 14:48.360
So in the past I personally had googled for best WordPress plugin for social icon widget or something

14:48.360 --> 14:49.640
along those lines.

14:49.770 --> 14:56.550
Anyways I just know through my own research that this simple social icons is a quality solution.

14:56.880 --> 15:00.380
We can see that it has over 200000 active installs.

15:00.480 --> 15:07.880
So let's use it let's click this install now button once the installation completes we can then click

15:07.880 --> 15:11.860
this blue activate button.

15:12.100 --> 15:18.940
And now let's jump back to our widget screen to the side bar hover over appearance and then the pop

15:18.940 --> 15:21.940
up menu we can click on widgets.

15:21.940 --> 15:28.030
And thanks to the plug in that we just installed now within our available widgets area down here we

15:28.030 --> 15:30.890
see simple social icons.

15:31.210 --> 15:34.590
So let's just click and drag that into our Sidebar.

15:35.840 --> 15:43.610
We could give it a title like follow me or get social or something cheesy along those lines but I think

15:43.610 --> 15:46.040
we could actually just leave that field blank.

15:46.040 --> 15:53.150
I don't think we need to label this area so you can obviously customize the size of the icons and the

15:53.150 --> 15:54.980
color of the icons.

15:55.160 --> 16:01.820
But more importantly if we scroll down you can see there are fields for practically every social media

16:01.820 --> 16:03.240
network there is.

16:03.470 --> 16:06.680
So the first big one that I see is Facebook.

16:06.680 --> 16:12.260
So it's up to you to go find your Facebook business page or fan page or company page or even use your

16:12.260 --> 16:17.050
personal page and copy and paste the link to it into this field.

16:17.270 --> 16:22.680
But I'm just going to paste my personal business or fan page you around.

16:22.880 --> 16:23.240
All right.

16:23.240 --> 16:29.960
Now you might have all of these different accounts flicker get her Google Instagram linked in but I

16:29.960 --> 16:35.190
know that the big other one that I want to use is Twitter and also YouTube.

16:35.570 --> 16:38.640
So let's scroll down they are in alphabetical order.

16:38.960 --> 16:40.730
So here I see Twitter.

16:40.730 --> 16:48.100
I will paste in my Twitter you Arel and then down here I see YouTube so I will paste in my youtube you

16:48.100 --> 16:49.580
are now perfect.

16:49.610 --> 16:56.600
And then I will just click this blue save button and if I switch back to my public front facing website

16:56.630 --> 16:58.070
and refresh.

16:58.100 --> 16:58.500
Cool.

16:58.520 --> 17:04.430
So now visitors of my web site can check out any of my social media accounts through these easy to access

17:04.430 --> 17:05.480
links.

17:05.480 --> 17:08.010
Now this lesson is almost complete.

17:08.120 --> 17:09.440
Let's do a quick review.

17:09.440 --> 17:13.040
And then there's one final widget related thing that I want to show you.

17:13.220 --> 17:21.170
So back in our admin dashboard to review each theme has different widget areas sidebar content bottom

17:21.170 --> 17:27.470
one content bottom two if you're using a different theme you might have a heavier widget area or food

17:27.480 --> 17:29.980
or widget area or any other name.

17:30.140 --> 17:36.620
But the idea is that WordPress shows us all of our available widgets and then we just click and drag

17:36.620 --> 17:39.110
them into the widget area that we want.

17:39.110 --> 17:44.390
We also learned that if WordPress doesn't come with the widget that we want there's no need to worry

17:44.390 --> 17:48.280
because there are thousands of plugins that we can search through.

17:48.410 --> 17:54.650
And odds are that someone has already created a plugin that will give us access to a new widget here

17:55.070 --> 17:58.510
that will allow us to achieve exactly what we are trying to set up.

17:58.700 --> 18:00.330
OK so that was the review.

18:00.350 --> 18:05.870
Now before we bring this lesson to a close there is one final thing I want to show you now widgets are

18:05.870 --> 18:12.590
great and sidebars can be great but you might have noticed a recent trend in web design where a lot

18:12.590 --> 18:16.100
of Web sites don't have a side bar side column.

18:16.160 --> 18:20.660
A lot of modern web sites only have the main column of content.

18:20.810 --> 18:27.440
So if you're like me you might want to remove the side column entirely so your Web site feels more minimalist

18:27.440 --> 18:31.690
and focused and clean and you just have your actual content.

18:31.700 --> 18:37.910
Now not every theme but a lot of themes are pretty flexible and all you need to do to get rid of the

18:37.910 --> 18:45.060
sidebar call them is simply delete any and all widgets that you have in that widget area.

18:45.290 --> 18:50.630
So I might do a time lapse and fast forward over this because I don't want to bore you to tears but

18:50.810 --> 18:58.960
if I just go through all of these widgets and click delete for each one so that my sidebar area is completely

18:58.960 --> 19:03.390
empty.

19:03.500 --> 19:09.140
OK so now that my sidebar widget area is completely empty if I jump back to my front facing web site

19:09.170 --> 19:17.350
and refresh my theme the 2016 theme is smart enough to just not display a side call them.

19:17.390 --> 19:22.820
Now again every theme is different so your theme might not do this but odds are pretty good that your

19:22.820 --> 19:25.820
theme is flexible enough to handle this for you.

19:25.820 --> 19:30.940
Anyways I encourage you to just jump in to your widget screen and begin experimenting.

19:30.950 --> 19:36.830
Experimenting is always the best way to learn and that's actually going to bring this lesson to a close

19:37.070 --> 19:42.710
in our next lesson we will finally begin building our Contact Us page.

19:42.740 --> 19:44.060
It should be a ton of fun.

19:44.120 --> 19:48.210
Let's keep rolling and I will see you in the next lesson.
