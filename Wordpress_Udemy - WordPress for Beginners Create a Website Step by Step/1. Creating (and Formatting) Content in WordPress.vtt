00:00.860 --> 00:08.690
Hello everyone in this lesson we will learn about building up real content for one of our pages without

00:08.690 --> 00:12.290
further ado let's just jump right into the action.

00:12.290 --> 00:13.010
All right.

00:13.040 --> 00:21.200
So this is my public facing WordPress Web site and if I use my navigation to navigate to the About Us

00:21.200 --> 00:24.090
page we can see that.

00:24.090 --> 00:29.310
Currently this page only has a tiny bit of placeholder content.

00:29.310 --> 00:34.980
So in this lesson we are going to add additional content to the page and along the way we will learn

00:35.040 --> 00:36.810
a few new skills.

00:37.150 --> 00:44.460
OK so if I want to make changes to this page if I want to edit this page assuming I'm logged into WordPress

00:44.490 --> 00:52.290
as the admin of the website I can just look up in the top bar of the page and make use of this edit

00:52.290 --> 00:53.480
page button.

00:55.730 --> 00:59.700
And that will take me directly to the edit screen for that page.

00:59.720 --> 01:02.610
So now I'm free to begin changing this content.

01:02.810 --> 01:06.420
Now obviously you're free to type out whatever content you would like.

01:06.500 --> 01:12.350
But here's what I'm going to type this business is our pride and joy.

01:13.100 --> 01:16.690
We've been around for a long time.

01:16.950 --> 01:17.420
OK.

01:17.440 --> 01:23.210
Now in the real world if this page was about you hopefully you would have more to say about yourself

01:23.210 --> 01:25.050
than just these two sentences.

01:25.280 --> 01:30.410
But for the purposes of keeping this video rolling along at a nice tempo I'm not going to type any other

01:30.410 --> 01:32.010
content manually.

01:32.120 --> 01:37.580
Instead I'm just going to paste in a bit of filler Laura emit some text.

01:37.800 --> 01:44.510
OK so imagine you have your intro paragraph here and then maybe you want to add a YouTube video to your

01:44.510 --> 01:49.030
page so maybe we want the next piece of content here to be a video.

01:49.250 --> 01:55.600
So as an example let me show you how relatively simple it is to add videos from YouTube to your page.

01:55.610 --> 02:00.890
Let me switch over to another browser window where I've navigated to YouTube dot com.

02:01.010 --> 02:05.410
Then just go ahead and find the video that you want to include on your page.

02:05.420 --> 02:08.790
OK so begin watching the video that you're interested in.

02:09.050 --> 02:14.570
And then right below the video player you will see a bit of information about the channel who owns the

02:14.570 --> 02:15.390
video.

02:15.590 --> 02:19.520
And then right below that content you'll see a share button.

02:19.750 --> 02:19.990
OK.

02:20.000 --> 02:25.310
So let me scroll down just a little bit and then I'm going to click this share button.

02:26.930 --> 02:34.420
Once I click that it gives me a few new options to choose from I can choose between share embed or e-mail

02:34.960 --> 02:37.080
we are interested in embed.

02:37.130 --> 02:44.060
We want to embed this video into our WordPress page so as soon as I click on embed YouTube gives me

02:44.060 --> 02:45.680
this bit of code.

02:45.680 --> 02:52.650
Now with this code highlighted go ahead and copy it into your clipboard then switch back to your Wordpress

02:52.740 --> 02:53.940
admin area.

02:54.180 --> 02:59.310
And as you might have guessed Now we just want to paste that code into our content here.

02:59.500 --> 03:06.180
However before we go ahead and paste in that code first we want to pay attention to these two tabs here.

03:06.330 --> 03:10.800
See these two tabs here that read visual and text.

03:10.800 --> 03:17.910
If I click on visual nothing happens because we're already using the visual editor or the visual mode

03:17.970 --> 03:19.410
of wordpress.

03:19.440 --> 03:23.100
Now 99 percent of the time visual mode is great.

03:23.100 --> 03:29.460
It makes it very simple to create content here but in this case we want to paste in that bit of code

03:29.520 --> 03:31.170
that YouTube gave us.

03:31.170 --> 03:35.780
So we want to switch over to the text view or the text mode.

03:35.850 --> 03:37.230
So let's click that.

03:37.420 --> 03:37.820
OK.

03:37.830 --> 03:44.520
And now let's place our cursor down here and now we're safe to paste in that code that YouTube gave

03:44.520 --> 03:45.250
us.

03:45.570 --> 03:47.310
So this is the code that YouTube gave us.

03:47.310 --> 03:52.480
I'm going to add a new space or empty line in between it and our paragraph.

03:52.730 --> 03:57.690
OK and with this code in place now I can switch back to the visual mode.

03:57.750 --> 04:01.520
So just click on visual again and there we have it.

04:01.520 --> 04:03.810
So there's the video added to our content.

04:03.980 --> 04:06.150
Let's test it out let's take it for a spin.

04:06.170 --> 04:09.510
So let's go ahead and click this blue update button.

04:13.240 --> 04:20.170
And now we see this success message page updated and we can use this view page link to immediately view

04:20.320 --> 04:22.170
the public facing page.

04:22.600 --> 04:27.760
OK so this is what the world will see when they come to our Web site and click on About Us.

04:27.760 --> 04:28.330
Pretty cool.

04:28.330 --> 04:33.020
So now if anyone comes to this page and clicks on this video it will begin playing.

04:33.040 --> 04:38.950
Now before we change gears and learn how to add our own photographs to this page I do want to show you

04:38.950 --> 04:40.890
one last YouTube tip.

04:41.140 --> 04:45.830
So currently Notice how this YouTube video has the title of the video right here.

04:45.850 --> 04:47.190
Maybe we don't want that.

04:47.260 --> 04:52.920
So if we go back to YouTube we can actually customize what YouTube gives us for the video player.

04:53.110 --> 04:56.130
So check this out after you click the share button.

04:56.350 --> 04:57.770
And then the embed button.

04:57.820 --> 05:01.170
And again remember I'm currently viewing YouTube dot com.

05:01.180 --> 05:03.140
Here's the code that YouTube gives you.

05:03.340 --> 05:07.610
But if you scroll down a little bit you'll see this show more option.

05:07.750 --> 05:14.560
And if I click that YouTube gives us new options we can use to customize the video experience that it

05:14.560 --> 05:15.480
gives us.

05:15.610 --> 05:19.000
So here we see we can change the size of the video player.

05:19.240 --> 05:27.250
So maybe instead of 60 I want 640 So that will make the video player a little bit larger on our page.

05:27.250 --> 05:29.930
And then you can also customize all of these settings.

05:30.010 --> 05:38.260
So I usually uncheck this first one shows suggested videos when the video finishes I uncheck that because

05:38.320 --> 05:43.600
I don't want to advertise for other people's videos when visitors of my website have finished watching

05:43.600 --> 05:44.460
the video.

05:44.650 --> 05:45.100
OK.

05:45.100 --> 05:50.590
And if for some reason you don't want the visitors of your website to be able to rewind or fast forward

05:50.650 --> 05:53.650
in the video you can uncheck this option.

05:54.500 --> 05:59.240
And if you don't want the title of the video to show up in the top left corner you can uncheck this

05:59.240 --> 05:59.880
option.

06:00.950 --> 06:01.340
OK.

06:01.350 --> 06:07.720
And now YouTube has given us a new bit of code here that takes all of our option choices into account.

06:07.920 --> 06:12.030
So again just go ahead and copy this new code into your clipboard.

06:12.120 --> 06:13.780
Go back to WordPress.

06:13.800 --> 06:15.480
This is the public facing Web site.

06:15.490 --> 06:24.620
So let me use this page button to go back to the admin side of things here we can see the video because

06:24.620 --> 06:26.340
we are in visual mode.

06:26.420 --> 06:30.480
But let's switch over to text mode.

06:30.480 --> 06:33.000
Here's the bit of code that creates the YouTube video.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.420
So just delete that and then paste in the brand new code.

06:36.420 --> 06:39.660
YouTube gave us out of space here.

06:39.660 --> 06:42.010
Go ahead and click the update button.

06:44.120 --> 06:45.860
Page was successfully updated.

06:45.860 --> 06:49.600
And then we can use this link to switch back to the public facing Web site.

06:49.670 --> 06:52.420
And now you can see the video is a little bit larger.

06:52.670 --> 06:55.670
And we don't have that annoying title right about here.

06:55.910 --> 06:56.270
OK.

06:56.270 --> 07:01.820
So that was a bit of a tangent on working with YouTube videos but hopefully you found it useful.

07:01.820 --> 07:07.020
Next let's change gears and let's add a bit of extra text below the video.

07:07.220 --> 07:12.380
And then let's also work on adding in our own photograph to the page.

07:12.380 --> 07:18.180
So if I want to edit the page again I'm going to use this edit page link up in the top bar.

07:18.200 --> 07:20.450
Currently we are using the text mode.

07:20.450 --> 07:23.450
Why don't we go ahead and switch back to the visual mode.

07:25.600 --> 07:25.950
OK.

07:25.970 --> 07:28.680
And we wanted to add a bit of text below the video.

07:28.700 --> 07:33.920
So I'm just going to click to the right of the video to place my cursor there and then hit enter or

07:33.920 --> 07:34.850
return.

07:34.970 --> 07:36.840
And now we can start typing again.

07:37.190 --> 07:42.380
Now instead of typing out a big paragraph I'm just going to paste in a bit of dummy text.

07:42.560 --> 07:45.250
Feel free to add whatever text you would like.

07:45.350 --> 07:47.280
Maybe pause this lesson for a moment.

07:47.300 --> 07:49.440
As you add in your own text.

07:49.640 --> 07:56.020
But next what we want to do is learn how to add our own photograph maybe to the right side of the text.

07:56.030 --> 07:57.490
So right about here.

07:57.830 --> 08:00.290
So let me show you how I would achieve that.

08:00.290 --> 08:06.120
I would place my cursor at the beginning of this text so right before the first word here.

08:07.420 --> 08:14.230
And then towards the top left of the screen noticed this ad media button go ahead and click that add

08:14.230 --> 08:16.800
media currently in my example here.

08:16.810 --> 08:23.620
Media Library is selected media library consists of all the files you've uploaded to WordPress in the

08:23.620 --> 08:24.630
past.

08:24.640 --> 08:30.010
So in my case all that I have in my library is the logo file that I'm using up in the header.

08:30.220 --> 08:32.240
And I don't want to use that in this instance.

08:32.260 --> 08:34.330
I want to upload a new photograph.

08:34.420 --> 08:43.720
So go ahead and click on this upload files but then choose this select files button and now it's up

08:43.720 --> 08:48.580
to you to find a photograph on your computer's hard drive that you want to use.

08:48.760 --> 08:55.570
So in my case I have a folder on my desktop named assets and I have this photo of myself named Brad

08:55.570 --> 08:57.080
photo that I'm going to use

08:59.690 --> 09:00.150
OK.

09:00.160 --> 09:06.610
And now along the right hand side of the screen in this area we can customize how that image gets added

09:06.610 --> 09:07.810
to the page.

09:07.810 --> 09:11.450
So for example we can control its size and its placement.

09:11.470 --> 09:13.910
So down here we see a line.

09:14.410 --> 09:16.440
So maybe I want to align it to the right.

09:16.450 --> 09:20.590
So it kind of floats to the right of all of the text that it's near.

09:20.650 --> 09:22.470
So I can choose right.

09:22.740 --> 09:24.170
I can choose a different size.

09:24.180 --> 09:31.740
But for now I'm going to leave it set to Medium and then click insert into page OK.

09:31.770 --> 09:33.300
And there we see it.

09:33.300 --> 09:39.300
Now next what if you want to add a caption to the photograph so maybe you want to add a bit of text

09:39.360 --> 09:43.160
right here right below the photo that pertains to the photo.

09:43.410 --> 09:47.490
Well you can always just click on the photo that you want to edit or work with.

09:47.610 --> 09:51.100
And then once I do that noticed this little pop up menu appears.

09:51.210 --> 09:53.780
Go ahead and use this pencil icon here.

09:53.880 --> 09:57.820
So if I hover over it it says edit OK.

09:57.840 --> 10:02.620
And from the screen you can customize the alignment of the photo and the size of the photo.

10:02.850 --> 10:08.410
But more importantly we see this first field is caption So I will type.

10:08.410 --> 10:16.340
This is a cheesy photo of myself and this alternative text field is also very important.

10:16.360 --> 10:22.690
So if for some reason the file fails to load for someone maybe their internet connection goes out for

10:22.690 --> 10:28.720
a second or the server is acting funny or if someone comes to our website and they are visually impaired

10:29.050 --> 10:33.890
and their computer has software that will read out loud the content of the page to them.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.150
Well in that case they can't see the image.

10:36.160 --> 10:38.960
But whatever we type here they will hear.

10:38.980 --> 10:43.390
So I would just say photo of Brad.

10:43.930 --> 10:49.510
This alternative text field can also help boost your search engine optimization rankings.

10:49.600 --> 10:52.010
So be sure to always fill out this field.

10:52.190 --> 10:54.640
OK then I'm going to click this update button.

10:56.320 --> 10:57.970
Here we can see the caption.

10:58.390 --> 11:00.880
And for now I'm happy with this content.

11:00.910 --> 11:06.730
So I'm going to use this blue update button to save my progress.

11:06.880 --> 11:13.590
Here we see this page successfully updated message and if I click View page this is what the general

11:13.590 --> 11:14.920
public will see.

11:16.130 --> 11:17.170
Looks good.

11:17.450 --> 11:21.560
OK so we just successfully added a photograph to the page.

11:21.560 --> 11:24.720
Now let's change gears and talk about something else.

11:24.740 --> 11:31.190
So if I scroll back up to the top of this page we can see that here is the title of this particular

11:31.190 --> 11:37.530
page about us and it uses a nice large font size because it's the title.

11:37.610 --> 11:43.400
But then we noticed that the rest of our content uses a very uniform standard font size.

11:43.430 --> 11:47.730
So the question becomes what if we want to have subheadings.

11:47.750 --> 11:53.840
So for example maybe I want to have my main page title here and then I want to have a subtitle or sub

11:53.840 --> 12:01.070
headline right here that reads about the company and then maybe down here before this text.

12:01.130 --> 12:05.430
Maybe I want to have another subheading right here that reads about me.

12:05.670 --> 12:05.980
OK.

12:05.990 --> 12:11.350
So basically the question at hand here is how do you use different font sizes.

12:11.630 --> 12:13.770
Let me show you how I would handle that.

12:13.820 --> 12:19.390
So if I want to edit this page again I can just use this edit page link up on the top bar.

12:20.500 --> 12:21.040
OK.

12:21.080 --> 12:28.810
And this field is what controls the main title of the page each page or post can only have one title.

12:28.880 --> 12:34.520
But what if we want to have subtitles or some headlines down here in our content.

12:34.520 --> 12:35.450
So check this out.

12:35.480 --> 12:40.780
If I create a new line of text type anything I want by default.

12:40.790 --> 12:45.830
Each new line of text is just considered a standard paragraph.

12:45.830 --> 12:49.950
So WordPress considers this a paragraph WordPress considers this a paragraph.

12:49.970 --> 12:56.330
You get the idea but if I want this piece of text to be treated as a headline I can just highlight it

12:56.900 --> 13:03.050
and then using this menu see this menu that currently says paragraph if I click on that I can choose

13:03.050 --> 13:05.790
between these different heading options.

13:05.870 --> 13:12.630
So if I choose heading one that's going to use a fairly large font size heading to maybe a little bit

13:12.630 --> 13:14.830
smaller you get the idea.

13:14.840 --> 13:19.320
Adding three is even smaller if you've ever used word processing software.

13:19.320 --> 13:23.290
These heading options are these formatting options should be a bit familiar.

13:23.430 --> 13:27.540
OK so feel free to use whatever heading level you feel is appropriate.

13:27.750 --> 13:35.130
I will use heading level 3 and then you can just say about the company or whatever text you want to

13:35.130 --> 13:42.060
use and then maybe down here right after the YouTube video I will say about me.

13:42.370 --> 13:48.090
OK so again by default a new line of text is considered a paragraph and then I can just highlight it

13:48.450 --> 13:51.570
use this menu and select headings 3.

13:51.600 --> 13:55.070
This looks good to me so I will use the blue update button.

13:56.330 --> 14:00.750
And let's go see how this content looks on the public facing portion of our Web site.

14:01.000 --> 14:01.490
OK.

14:01.520 --> 14:04.630
So here's one of the new subheadings we just created.

14:04.740 --> 14:09.230
If I scroll down a bit here's the other one looks good.

14:09.440 --> 14:13.070
And that's actually going to bring this lesson to a close.

14:13.190 --> 14:18.280
I know that we covered a lot in this lesson and we moved at a fairly fast pace.

14:18.500 --> 14:19.760
So it's OK if you didn't.

14:19.760 --> 14:22.520
One hundred percent absorb everything.

14:22.520 --> 14:28.490
If that's the case if you're feeling like this lesson went a little too fast why don't you try this.

14:28.520 --> 14:32.800
Why don't you go and create a brand new page in wordpress.

14:32.810 --> 14:35.150
There are a few different ways you can do that.

14:35.180 --> 14:41.630
If you're currently viewing the public facing portion of your website just look in this top bar for

14:41.630 --> 14:44.950
the button that reads new right about here.

14:45.080 --> 14:50.060
And if you hover over it within this menu you can click on page.

14:50.240 --> 14:56.330
That's one way to create a new page or you can use this link to just go back to your dashboard in general

14:57.560 --> 15:04.040
and then in the admin side bar look for pages and then you can click add new.

15:04.040 --> 15:09.380
All right now if you feel like this lesson went a little bit too fast why don't you just watch this

15:09.390 --> 15:14.490
lesson a second time and apply the techniques you see to this new page.

15:14.540 --> 15:17.840
WordPress doesn't limit how many pages we can create.

15:17.870 --> 15:22.730
Practicing again and again and experimenting is the best way to move forward.

15:22.880 --> 15:27.800
Now in our next lesson we will learn how to create sub pages.

15:27.800 --> 15:33.890
More importantly I guess we will learn what a sub page even is and we will also learn how to create

15:33.920 --> 15:38.380
dropdown menus within our main navigation link menu.

15:38.660 --> 15:45.670
And finally we'll also learn how to add links to our other pages within our paragraphs of content.

15:45.770 --> 15:47.180
It should be a lot of fun.

15:47.210 --> 15:51.310
Let's keep things rolling and I will see you in the next lesson.
