Hello everyone in this lesson we will learn about two settings permalink and pagination.

00:08.820 --> 00:11.570
So naturally Two questions come to mind.

00:11.760 --> 00:15.740
What in the world is a permalink and what is pagination.

00:15.840 --> 00:18.100
We are going to answer both of those questions.

00:18.120 --> 00:21.590
And right now let's begin with permalink x.

00:21.770 --> 00:29.490
Ok so here's the home page of my website and to find navigate to the travel archive page and then click

00:29.490 --> 00:32.340
on the trip to the Midwest post.

00:32.630 --> 00:39.850
I'm taken to the detail screen for just this one single post and most importantly if we look up in the

00:39.850 --> 00:42.050
U R L bar the address bar.

00:42.240 --> 00:48.260
This is the permalink or permanent link for this blog post.

00:48.270 --> 00:51.420
The idea is that this link will not change.

00:51.510 --> 01:00.210
So even if we changed the title of this blog post to my unbelievably amazing summer trip to the Midwest

01:00.510 --> 01:07.320
even if the title changed to you RL should stay the same so it would still be the root of our RL.

01:07.350 --> 01:13.320
And then the year that this post was created and then the month and then the date and then the original

01:13.320 --> 01:14.780
title or slug.

01:14.940 --> 01:21.120
We want this you Arel to be permanent and set in stone because as search engines start indexing our

01:21.120 --> 01:28.710
Web site and as we start sharing links to our posts either via social media or email we want those links

01:28.710 --> 01:29.330
to work.

01:29.370 --> 01:35.440
Even years into the future because nothing is worse than a 4 0 4 error screen.

01:35.520 --> 01:37.090
So let me show you an example.

01:37.110 --> 01:40.320
So if we link someone to an incorrect view RL.

01:40.350 --> 01:43.710
So if I just type a bunch of jibberish here and push enter.

01:44.190 --> 01:48.050
Obviously WordPress has no idea which post I'm referring to here.

01:48.120 --> 01:48.680
So we see.

01:48.720 --> 01:51.020
Oops that page can't be found.

01:51.170 --> 01:51.560
OK.

01:51.570 --> 01:56.650
And the idea is that if our links are permanent hence the name Permalink.

01:56.850 --> 02:02.250
If they don't change over time we don't need to worry about that page not found screen.

02:02.400 --> 02:07.890
Now you might be thinking that permalink sound really simple and you might wonder why I even bother

02:07.890 --> 02:08.950
to bring them up.

02:09.060 --> 02:15.810
Well what I want to show you now is that WordPress gives us the flexibility to change our permalink

02:15.810 --> 02:16.920
structure.

02:16.980 --> 02:21.990
So for example maybe we don't want to include the year in the month and the date.

02:22.170 --> 02:27.840
Maybe instead we just want the root of our domain and then the title of the post.

02:27.900 --> 02:32.220
Or maybe we just want the root of our domain and then a year and then the post.

02:32.340 --> 02:34.600
So maybe we want to leave out the month in the day.

02:34.710 --> 02:35.730
You get the idea.

02:35.760 --> 02:41.710
There are countless different possibilities of how we could structure our permalink you ourselves.

02:41.730 --> 02:43.090
Let me show you what I mean.

02:43.230 --> 02:51.000
So if I jump into my admin dashboard and in the left hand side bar hover over the settings option towards

02:51.000 --> 02:59.140
the bottom and within this menu look for permalink X OK now from this screen we can choose between a

02:59.140 --> 03:06.880
few different settings by default WordPress chooses the day and name option and that's the structure

03:06.880 --> 03:13.290
that uses the year and then the month and then the day and finally the name or title of the post.

03:13.330 --> 03:19.330
But instead of that default option we could use montha name so that includes the year in the month but

03:19.330 --> 03:20.930
leaves out the day.

03:21.040 --> 03:27.100
Or we can use my favorite option which is post name so you can see that that doesn't use the date at

03:27.100 --> 03:27.710
all.

03:27.730 --> 03:31.570
It's simply the root domain and then the title of the post.

03:31.750 --> 03:40.540
So if I click this post name and then scroll down to the bottom and click save changes we see this success

03:40.540 --> 03:43.220
message permalink structure updated.

03:43.420 --> 03:49.100
And now if I jump over to the front facing portion of my website and click on travel.

03:49.420 --> 03:53.300
Now when I click on trip to the Midwest take a look at the permalink.

03:53.380 --> 03:59.870
I like this option because this is fairly easy to type or remember but is totally just personal preference.

03:59.950 --> 04:04.120
So feel free to choose whichever permalink structure you like the best.

04:04.120 --> 04:09.530
However I do want to stress that you should really stick with one permalink structure.

04:09.670 --> 04:13.750
So don't go around constantly changing your permalink options.

04:13.750 --> 04:19.350
Right because the entire idea of a permalink is that it is a permanent link.

04:19.450 --> 04:21.470
It shouldn't change over time.

04:21.580 --> 04:27.100
So when your web site is still relatively new and you don't have tons of content yet and you haven't

04:27.100 --> 04:32.710
really been sharing the post you are Elle's on social media yet and maybe the big search engines like

04:32.710 --> 04:36.130
Google haven't really had enough time to index your site yet.

04:36.130 --> 04:41.160
In the beginning it's ok to experiment with the different permalink options that we see here.

04:41.320 --> 04:46.720
But once your Web site has been around for a while I don't recommend changing the settings.

04:46.720 --> 04:52.510
Also it's worth mentioning that if you have an idea for a permalink structure and you don't see it here.

04:52.690 --> 04:58.120
Right so for example maybe you want the root of your domain and then just the year but not the month

04:58.120 --> 05:00.860
or day and then the title of the post.

05:01.030 --> 05:03.330
Well we don't see that as an option here.

05:03.430 --> 05:08.050
So that's where this final option named custom structure can come into play.

05:08.050 --> 05:14.260
So for example you will notice that as I click on these different options this area right here changes

05:14.260 --> 05:15.340
each time.

05:15.670 --> 05:23.630
And what that's doing is it's showing us the code that WordPress uses to represent these example structures.

05:23.770 --> 05:29.600
So for example when I click on day and name here's the code that represents that.

05:29.620 --> 05:32.240
But we can customize that no problem.

05:32.260 --> 05:42.320
So if I just want the year and then the title or the Post name let's just delete month name and day.

05:43.110 --> 05:50.190
OK and then let's scroll down and click save changes and now if I jump back to my Web site and refresh

05:50.190 --> 05:55.010
the category travel page and click on trip to the Midwest again.

05:55.110 --> 05:55.710
Perfect.

05:55.750 --> 06:00.360
The U R L is simply my domain and then the year and then the title.

06:00.360 --> 06:05.700
So the idea is that you can really fine tune whatever structure you want within this custom structure

06:05.700 --> 06:06.400
field.

06:06.590 --> 06:12.810
All right so at this point we understand what a permalink is and how to customize or permalink structure.

06:12.810 --> 06:16.970
Now let's change gears and let's talk about pagination.

06:17.160 --> 06:20.830
So first we need to ask ourselves what is pagination.

06:20.940 --> 06:27.720
Let's begin by looking at an example of pagination in action from my home page if I click on the recipe's

06:27.720 --> 06:31.490
link behind the scenes before this lesson.

06:31.490 --> 06:40.430
I created a bunch of new recipe posts so dried apple chips orange scones banana waffles blueberry cinnamon

06:40.490 --> 06:41.630
you get the idea.

06:41.720 --> 06:50.260
And if I keep scrolling down after we scrolled by 10 a blog posts now down here we have the option to

06:50.260 --> 06:57.130
go to the second page of posts so this screen that we're on right now showed us the 10 most recent recipe

06:57.130 --> 07:02.740
posts and if we want to see the older posts we need to click on to page two.

07:04.510 --> 07:04.900
OK.

07:04.910 --> 07:11.450
And that concept of only showing a certain amount of posts per page instead of just showing all posts

07:11.510 --> 07:18.890
on a single screen that's referred to as pagination we are splitting up the results into multiple pages

07:19.040 --> 07:22.190
so each page shows 10 posts.

07:22.220 --> 07:27.950
So right now I'm on page two of the recipe's archive and if I scroll down to the bottom I can click

07:27.950 --> 07:31.080
to go back to page 1 OK.

07:31.110 --> 07:39.980
Now by default WordPress will include 10 posts per page but we can customize the way pagination works.

07:39.990 --> 07:47.040
So instead of 10 what if we want there to be only 3 posts per page and then users would need to click

07:47.040 --> 07:50.250
to go to the next page to see the next three.

07:50.430 --> 07:52.530
Well that's super easy to set up.

07:52.560 --> 07:59.310
So if we just jumped to our admin dashboard and look in the sidebar under the settings option within

07:59.310 --> 08:08.070
this menu look for reading and on this reading settings screen we're looking for this blog pages show

08:08.080 --> 08:10.590
at most field by default.

08:10.600 --> 08:16.560
It's set to 10 but we can just change this to three or any other number that we'd like.

08:16.630 --> 08:23.700
And then click Save changes and now let's jump back to our front facing web site and click on recipe's

08:23.700 --> 08:24.690
again.

08:24.690 --> 08:31.260
So now we see dried apple chips orange scones banana waffles and then we have to go to the next page

08:31.260 --> 08:32.770
to see the next three.

08:33.030 --> 08:38.910
So Page 2 includes blueberry cinnamon scones Berry medley fed a chicken salad.

08:38.920 --> 08:41.540
We want the next three we have to go to page three.

08:41.640 --> 08:42.760
You get the idea.

08:42.900 --> 08:44.730
So this is totally personal preference.

08:44.730 --> 08:48.760
It's completely up to you how many posts per page you want to use.

08:48.990 --> 08:55.710
And I encourage you to experiment with different values on this reading setting screen and that's actually

08:55.710 --> 08:58.540
going to bring this lesson to a close.

08:58.800 --> 08:59.900
Let's keep things rolling.

08:59.940 --> 09:02.600
And I will see you in the next lesson.
