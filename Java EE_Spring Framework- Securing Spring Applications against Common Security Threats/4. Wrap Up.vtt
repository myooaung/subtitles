00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:04.930
The main takeaway from this module is don't leave unencrypted

2
00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:08.130
secrets in your source code or properties files.

3
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.440
Secret management is more than just encryption.

4
00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.160
It's about frequent rotation, auditing,

5
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.640

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:19.330
But next,
