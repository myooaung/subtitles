Hi, it's Wojciech Lesniak.

2
00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:08.630
Welcome to this module where we will explore what Spring Security is,

3
00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:11.410
what benefits it brings to your application,

4
00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:16.640
and why you should consider using it to secure your applications.

5
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:17.870
In a nutshell.

6
00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:21.920
Spring Security is a highly customizable authentication and

7
00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.740
access control framework for Java applications.

8
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.570
Out of the box, with just a few lines of configuration,

9
00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.950
it gives you a robust selection of authentication and authorization

10
00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:39.240
strategies that you can leverage from basic authentication,

11
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:44.770
form, OpenID Connect, OAuth2, LDAP, JWTs,

12
00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:46.640
you name it.

13
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.720
It also protects your application from common security threats,

14
00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:56.420
such as session fixation, clickjacking, cross‑site request forgery,

15
00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.840
and cross‑site scripting.

16
00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.320
Now Spring Security actually begins securing your application at the

17
00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.660
browser by instructing it to communicate more securely with your

18
00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:12.180
server and then server side by providing access control into your

19
00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.550
application and even internally in your code for access control on

20
00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.840
method calls and domain objects.

21
00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.940
It's an application layer security framework,

22
00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.840
so you're not tied to any web server's proprietary security implementation,

23
00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.640
making your application portable.

24
00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.420
It's also loosely coupled.

25
00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.120
You can configure it in such a way that you can easily migrate your

26
00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:41.240
app's security to another framework in the future.

27
00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.440
It also has a solid track record, and it's been around since 2003,

28
00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.370
and it's maintained by a large open source community of security

29
00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:54.520
nerds with a vested interest in keeping the framework up to date

30
00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.860
with the latest security threats and trends,

31
00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.940
vulnerabilities and best practices.

32
00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:02.540
And let's face it,

33
00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.080
most developers would rather work on new and exciting

34
00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.230
features rather than writing security code,

35
00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:12.040
and that's not necessarily a bad thing.

36
00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.690
The new and exciting features are what pay the bills

37
00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.710
and keep the competition at bay.

38
00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.340
So why reinvent the wheel?

39
00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.390
There's safety within the herd.

40
00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.810
You don't want to be the lone sheep when wolves are around.

41
00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:25.940
In fact,

42
00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.460
due to the increased adoption of security frameworks like Spring Security,

43
00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:34.380
vulnerabilities such as cross‑site request forgery and cross‑site

44
00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.640
scripting are no longer on the OWASP top 10.

45
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:39.490
In this course,

46
00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:43.140
we will look at how you can correctly configure Spring Security

47
00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.140
in your web applications and how you can tailor the framework to

48
00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.860
your specific security requirements.

49
00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.040
But before we get stuck into configuring Spring Security,

50
00:02:54.040 --> 00:03:01.000
let's clear up a few important concepts that we will be using frequently throughout the remainder of the course.
