00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:03.860
As you're probably starting to see,

2
00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:07.920
you can change the behavior of Spring Security by manipulating

3
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.540
the filter chains and the filters within them.

4
00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.450
You achieve this by interacting with the WebSecurity,

5
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:16.820
HttpSecurity,

6
00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:23.140
and the authorization manager builders via the WebSecurityConfigurationAdapter.

7
00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.820
Now behind the scenes, by default,

8
00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.790
Spring Security is doing a lot more than just

9
00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:31.200
authenticating the users' credentials.

10
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.230
By default,

11
00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.120
it's protecting your application from many of the common

12
00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.780
security threats like cross‑site request,

13
00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:50.000
forgery, cross‑site scripting, clickjacking, and much more. In the next module, you will learn how it achieves this and why it's important.
