00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:02.800
In this module,

2
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:06.030
you learned how to set up Spring Security and Spring Boot to

3
00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:09.390
accommodate a single page application front end.

4
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:13.090
This was a simple setup where Spring Security hosted the SPA

5
00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:17.460
application so requests went to the same origin,

6
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.840
and we maintained the state server side via sessions and cookies.

7
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.240
This is great for a small application,

8
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.000
but there is more single page application security,

9
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.820
as you might require more complicated setups where your application is

10
00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:37.210
communicating to a back‑end API via an API gateway or stateless

11
00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.110
microservices, and the requests might be cross origin.

12
00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.330
So if you want to learn more,

13
00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:48.540
check out my course, Effective OAuth 2 with Spring Security and Spring Boot.

14
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.190
This covers how you can set up your single page application with Spring

15
00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:57.900
Security and Spring Boot using OAuth 2, JSON Web Tokens, OpenID Connect,

16
00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:02.220
how to handle cross‑origin requests, how to communicate with stateless

17
00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.520
microservices, and much more.

18
00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:05.250
But, next,

19
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:12.000
let's look at how to correctly handle authentication and authorization exceptions.
