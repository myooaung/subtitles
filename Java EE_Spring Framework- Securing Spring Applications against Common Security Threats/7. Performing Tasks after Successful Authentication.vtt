00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:03.990
Now after successful authentication,

2
00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.600
you might need to perform some tasks like send out an email to the

3
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.950
user to notify them of an authentication event.

4
00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:15.990
Now this could give them a heads up if any unauthorized access is taking place,

5
00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.300
and you can achieve this by using an authentication success handler. Just create

6
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.470
a class that implements the authentication success handler interface and

7
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.500
override the OnAuthenticationSuccess method.

8
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.320
Now here, you have access to the request, the response object, and

9
00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.660
the authentication object to perform any tasks you require as post

10
00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.930
successful authentication of a user. Once created, we add it via

11
00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.940
the form builder method.

12
00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:50.000
So now when our authentication is successful, our authentication handler will be executed.
