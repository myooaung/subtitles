1
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:04,440
This concludes the module and the course.

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,650
Thank you for taking the time to understand the framework at

3
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:10,720
a more granular level as, unfortunately,

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:15,540
security tends to be an afterthought with developers as you

5
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:19,840
don't tend to get recognition for getting security right as

6
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,200
you would releasing a feature early.

7
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,120
However,

8
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:26,100
the implications of getting it wrong for your users

9
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,760
and organization can be dire.

10
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:31,830
So even if you don't get recognition, dig down.

11
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:36,030
You'll know that you are doing right by your users, and that's good karma.

12
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:38,410
This will be the first course in the series that will be

13
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:42,340
released. In subsequent courses, we'll cover more advanced

14
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:45,430
topics on security storing credentials,

15
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:48,740
multifactor authentication, session management,

16
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:54,370
advanced authorization techniques from URL, method, and domain objects, how

17
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:58,800
to outsource your authentication using OAuth 2. You can follow me to get

18
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,270
notifications when these new courses are released.

19
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,370
If you can't wait,

20
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:07,040
then you can check out my previous courses: Spring Security

21
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,040
Authentication/Authorization: Layers of Defense,

22
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:14,040
which is a little out of date but contains most of these advanced topics.

23
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,730
Also, my course on OAuth 2 and Spring Security.

24
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:26,000
Thank you for taking the time to view my course. Let me know in the comments if you have any questions or feedback.
