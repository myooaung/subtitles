Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.300
My name is Wojciech Lesniak, and welcome to my course, Spring

3
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:14.110
Framework: Securing Spring Applications Against Common Security

4
00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:18.300
Threats. It is important to get security right.

5
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.730
The consequences of a security breach are high.

6
00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.040
We have all seen the headlines,

7
00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:28.500
The good news is Spring Security protects your application against some of the

8
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.860
most common security threats right out of the box, and is one of the most

9
00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.740
popular frameworks for securing Java applications.

10
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:38.710
In this course,

11
00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.100
you will learn how to get up and running with Spring Security and Spring

12
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:47.110
Boot right from the getâ€‘go so that your security evolves along with your

13
00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:51.960
application's architecture and is not left to the very end of the project

14
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.140
where it's hard to implement.

15
00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.360
Some of the major topics that we will cover include the underlying

16
00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.580
architecture of Spring Security and the common threats it protects

17
00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:07.680
your application against, how to configure authentication for both

18
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.640
multipage and single page applications,

19
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:17.140
enabling HTTPS and securely encrypting and accessing secrets in your code,

20
00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.710
correctly handling authentication and authorization exceptions.

21
00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.320
By the end of this course,

22
00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.840
you will know the fundamentals of effectively securing your

23
00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.200
application against common security threats with Spring Security

24
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.610
and Spring Boot. Before beginning the course, you should be

25
00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:36.940
familiar with the Spring Framework.

26
00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:41.420
I hope you will join me on this journey to learn Spring Security with

27
00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:53.000
the Spring Framework: Securing Spring Applications against Common Security Threats course at Pluralsight.
