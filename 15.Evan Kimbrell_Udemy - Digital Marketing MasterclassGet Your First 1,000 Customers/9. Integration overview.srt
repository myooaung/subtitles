1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:02,530
OK guys welcome back to the cause.

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:07,020
Now we're in the homestretch here a video marketing and we've spent all this time talking about making

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:08,730
videos editing them.

4
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:12,600
Eventually you'll have some great videos ready for people to see and then what.

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,360
Well that's what this lecture is going to be all about.

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,750
It's about integrating your videos into your marketing plans.

7
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:22,050
There's a couple of important questions you'd answer when it comes to your videos.

8
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:24,120
Number one where are you going to host them.

9
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:28,910
The video files you export from premiere or whatever program you use need to go somewhere right.

10
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,370
We talked about YouTube way back in the preproduction section of US course.

11
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:33,650
And yeah that is an option.

12
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:39,230
You to use things like wisteria or quick sprout or actually you can host them on your own server.

13
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,740
However we're not going to get into that.

14
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:45,480
We'll talk a little bit more in detail about the first couple options here in this lecture and then

15
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,530
number two where will you be using these videos.

16
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:49,820
Now you've got your videos done.

17
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:54,570
This means you can start adding them to Web site pages social media blog post landing pages all kinds

18
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:55,460
of places.

19
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:59,070
Well I've got some recommendations on how to add your videos so they have a better chance of being found

20
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:00,080
by search engines.

21
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:02,710
And to help you accomplish whatever goals you've set for yourself.

22
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:03,930
So first things first.

23
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:05,480
Let's talk about video hosting.

24
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:10,440
Now once your video files get exported from your editing program they need to get posted somewhere and

25
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,270
really there are two ways to go about it.

26
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:17,970
Free and paid free solutions include places like YouTube and Vimeo and really that's about it.

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,550
With regards of these two you might choose Vimeo because their player looks a lot nicer it looks pretty

28
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:29,280
classy if you're trying to make a video that looks fancy or looks hip or you might use YouTube.

29
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:35,820
Because while Youtube is owned by Google and you better believe that Google is pretty biased towards

30
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:40,800
youtube search results YouTube really has no limits on how much video you can upload to them.

31
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,100
They don't track how much bandwidth you're using.

32
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:48,330
If you put it on YouTube you can get these videos can get seen throughout their community but then you

33
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:50,390
can also embed them wherever you want.

34
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,700
I think between the two I usually would go with YouTube.

35
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:59,940
So as far as the free hosting platforms go there are generally pluses and minuses both Vimeo and YouTube

36
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:00,720
are community.

37
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:04,820
So if you post something on there then oftentimes it's gonna be seen by people in their community.

38
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,490
They can be a plus or a minus.

39
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:10,250
And a lot of situations where people might say find your video on YouTube.

40
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:14,310
Well it creates kind of a barrier between your YouTube video and where you want them to go which is

41
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:15,000
your Web site.

42
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,500
So a lot of times you really have to make your videos specifically for the YouTube audience and in a

43
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,040
specific way to get them to go from there to the page that you want.

44
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:28,380
So usually those two options are fine unless for some reason you have some concerns about it being opened

45
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:33,240
up to large communities or if you don't like the video player or something like that or maybe you don't

46
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:37,740
even like the analytics that you get from the free versions if that's the case well then you have paid

47
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:38,220
options.

48
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,840
Now we briefly discussed these back.

49
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:44,450
I don't care what lecture I think when we're talking about YouTube or I mentioned places like Whist

50
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,680
Yeah video card sprout video and I think one other one.

51
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,880
Anyway these paid video hosting services offer some pretty nice features.

52
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:54,930
They provide a reliable hosting for your videos and can offer better performance than YouTube.

53
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,350
Each service has its own unique features as well.

54
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,960
Did your ad has some nice features if you doing interesting thing in live streams.

55
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:07,740
The Tsar often offers bulk video uploads which yes supports things like 360 video and also allows you

56
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:10,480
to customize their video player if that's something you need.

57
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:14,400
But the three most important features with these third party hosts in my opinion are under the number

58
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,310
one is the ability to ad calls and actions and forms right inside your video.

59
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:25,140
You don't do that with YouTube and Vimeo but usually those clicks lead them back to YouTube and then

60
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,910
you need to direct them to another place.

61
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:32,190
Also YouTube kind of limits what kind of calls actions and cards as they call them you can put in them

62
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:37,530
whereas whiskey like sprout video there's a lot more you can do.

63
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:42,240
Number two is you have access to a much wider range of expanded analytics about the performance of your

64
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:42,780
videos.

65
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:47,390
And then number three you have more advanced ways to embed the videos on your own site.

66
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:49,470
So about those called actions you're talking about.

67
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:51,960
Now remember the goals you want accomplish with these videos.

68
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,540
Did you want to generate leads or sign ups for something.

69
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:59,340
If so then the ability to add a sign up form right at the end of your video saves you a bunch of steps

70
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:04,440
and it removes a lot of friction for your user rather than ask them to go somewhere else or to look

71
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,410
around the page for the form you're talking about.

72
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:10,880
It's right there you can put the form at the beginning and require an e-mail to watch the video.

73
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:13,980
I think it's kind of a dick move or you put it in the middle.

74
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:17,940
The promise of more or input at the end knowing that the person that makes it the end is probably a

75
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:18,880
satisfied viewer.

76
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:23,400
So let's call that action in your video are a nice feature the analytics you can get from these third

77
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,710
party hosts can be pretty insightful as well.

78
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:30,090
Some of them offer visuals where you can see how long people watched a video and where people dropped

79
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:31,520
off by looking at it.

80
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:34,590
You can see which parts of your video interest them and which ones don't.

81
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:42,270
Now YouTube and Vimeo have these basic analytics but they just don't go into as much detail as for instance

82
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,860
wisteria or sprout video.

83
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:48,960
Now some of these paid hosting services will also offer integrations with Google analytics so that way

84
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,470
you can actually see all of your information on one place.

85
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:56,040
That's actually pretty helpful especially if you have a page that's Google Analytics stats and has a

86
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:56,720
video in it.

87
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,800
And then you have to go to waste.

88
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:02,700
You have to look at your stats for that specific and then like have two tabs open but the other important

89
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:07,980
feature that all of these other paid hosts are really helpful with is making sure your videos work where

90
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,000
you want them to.

91
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:13,710
And this is the next thing you have to think about where will these videos go once they're hosted.

92
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:18,900
I mean what pages or platforms do you put them on while sharing on social is pretty straightforward.

93
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:24,450
You just go to Facebook and upload the video and then hit post or Twitter you go to tweet at it post

94
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:29,610
putting videos on your actual custom Web site requires an understanding of embedding.

95
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:34,260
Now if you want to embed videos on your site basically you need to add some code from a third party

96
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:36,150
host that allows this video to show up.

97
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:40,470
Now don't freak out because I said code well this is probably the easiest thing you could ever do with

98
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:40,870
code.

99
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:46,130
It's also important for the video to appear in a way that match the design experience of your site.

100
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:51,330
Thus third party hosts are pretty helpful usually with these paid hosts you can customize the look of

101
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:56,970
your video player you can change the border the color make your own custom thumbnails things like that

102
00:05:57,150 --> 00:06:02,730
if you put a youtube video I mean you could almost always spot a YouTube video being embedded in someone's

103
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:04,710
site and it's largely what YouTube wants.

104
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:06,960
They want you to constantly be reminded of their platform.

105
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,160
Now in the case of almost all of these they'll just give you the code and it's usually just an embed

106
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,790
button somewhere in their analytics platform and it's just something you copy and paste.

107
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:19,560
But for example you can have a video appear right on the page or in line or you could have the video

108
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:24,000
up here above the page in its own window or what some people call pop over.

109
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,380
So while embedding is pretty straightforward there's a lot of options you can actually try when you

110
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,850
embed a video on your site.

111
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:33,870
Ideally you'd like search engines to be able to see it and drive people to your site.

112
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:38,580
However this is where embedding from YouTube might become a problem when Google sees a YouTube video

113
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:39,480
embedded on your site.

114
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:44,480
It basically gives the NCO value back to the youtube page with a video lives.

115
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:48,660
Now that doesn't do you any favors when you're trying to drive traffic to your site and get people to

116
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:54,950
buy stuff in a lot of cases will end up happening is since YouTube has a higher page rank in your SCA.

117
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:56,940
We have got to go yet but just listen.

118
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:02,910
What will happen is you'll search for something and the YouTube version of your video will outrank your

119
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:05,930
page that has your YouTube video embedded in it.

120
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:11,820
So in that case many third party hosts use code to ensure that the page you embed a video on gets all

121
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:15,700
of the SVOD benefits and not being directed back to say like a VCR.

122
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,780
They might also help you create a video site map.

123
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:22,320
You can add to your site so search engines know about all the video content you have to offer much faster.

124
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:24,930
So review your goals and figure out what's important to you.

125
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:30,120
Video Views and shares well maybe YouTube is probably your best bet because hosting on there also gives

126
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,870
you access to their community.

127
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:36,770
And since Google favors YouTube well you'll get that YouTube link much much higher up.

128
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,610
But if you trying to drive traffic to your site.

129
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:42,210
Well then probably I paid third party video host is gonna be better.

130
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:45,480
Or maybe you want people to sign up for newsletters or buy things based on your videos.

131
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,960
Well I'd absolutely push for a paid solution in those cases.

132
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,890
You could really have a lot more flexibility with the call to action.

133
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,610
Now compare the hosts out there and find the one that makes most sense for you.

134
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,740
OK that's it for this luxury.

135
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:56,640
We've got more to go.

136
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,240
See you then.
