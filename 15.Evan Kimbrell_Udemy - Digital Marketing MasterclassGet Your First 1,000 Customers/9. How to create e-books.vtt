00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:05.670
Hey guys welcome back to the course so we introduce e-books and our last lecture but now let's discuss

2
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.440
how you go about creating one.

3
00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:14.190
Now the first thing to know is that e-books are kind of like books except for a shorter and a fraction

4
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.260
of the effort went into it.

5
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.930
Well the link is actually up to you.

6
00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.570
You can make your e-book as long as you want but if you want to produce more of these things shoot for

7
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.690
a length in the neighborhood of say 20 to 30 pages.

8
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.700
Keep in mind that many e-books also have a lot of visuals so in terms of writing you might not have

9
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:35.610
to actually write a 20 or 30 pages of stuff could actually just be 15 or it could be less.

10
00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.410
And then also keep in mind you might be borrowing stuff from your blog so you're only creating new stuff

11
00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.580
for maybe half of that.

12
00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.760
Your design and your use of visuals will affect that final now.

13
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.490
Now if you watch a lecture on how to create a White Paper Well these next steps might sound familiar

14
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.780
really because when you create any kind of content you kind of have to start in the same process.

15
00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:59.080
Well first what do you do you remember you identify your audience.

16
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.230
Who exactly are you reading this e-book for and keep in mind this e-book might not be the exact same

17
00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:11.880
audience as your overall website is targeting might be a really specific subset really specific problem

18
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:14.370
or skill set that a really specific group needs.

19
00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:17.790
What do you figure this out this will help you figure out a good topic that's going to be relevant to

20
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:18.050
them.

21
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.380
So pick your topic for a white paper.

22
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.160
We usually choose a problem to solve the case of an e-book.

23
00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:30.590
Well we generally want to pick a topic or a concept or a collection of concepts to cover in the end

24
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.210
probably does solve a problem too.

25
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.200
But the focus will be more about providing in-depth detail and best practices and proving a point.

26
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.700
The research data I really like his example from you ex-Penn though he mentioned in the last lecture

27
00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.590
you ex-Penn knows that their audience is probably going to be a bunch of user experience people designing

28
00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.180
apps and Web sites and other types of things.

29
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.480
So creating an e-book for that audience well helps you ex-Penn strengthen the relationship with them

30
00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.410
and prove that they're worth it.

31
00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:57.670
A I should use my tool.

32
00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.530
The topic they chose is a perfect one for their audience how to launch a U.S. career and get paid.

33
00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.130
Well the ebook is about serving the needs of the audience and setting them up for career success.

34
00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:14.580
Well your e-book can be a way to set up your audience with success as a designer or developer or whatever

35
00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.990
whatever you choose the audience and the topic should be perfect matches for each other.

36
00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.580
Next you should write up a title and an outline.

37
00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.140
The title should essentially be the topic in headline form.

38
00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.910
The line people will read on the landing page or on an ad and then say OK that is something that's directly

39
00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.380
relevant to me and I need to read it.

40
00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.000
Your title can be a work in progress and maybe you won't actually get it finalized until you finish

41
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.520
writing the ebook and that is perfectly fine but your outline should be something that begins to provide

42
00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.530
structure for what you're about to create.

43
00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.460
Your outline should resemble the chapters of a book since this is an e-book.

44
00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:52.740
Kind of makes sense so lay out the major chapters first and then dig into each one specifically.

45
00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.480
Making a note of the details steps or instructions you need to cover along the way.

46
00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.920
At this point start writing.

47
00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.120
Use your outline as a guide and fill in all the spaces.

48
00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:07.160
Now earlier I mentioned a lot of e-books weigh in at like 20 to 30 pages.

49
00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:13.110
But in terms of word count well it's actually probably more like I don't know two thousand six thousand

50
00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.560
words.

51
00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.010
Remember these a lot of visuals depends on detail.

52
00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:21.300
Obviously you need to be the best advice I can give you here is that you need to provide the detail

53
00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.370
your audience expects and needs.

54
00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.710
Don't cut yourself off because you reached a word limit providing value is much more while valuable

55
00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:30.940
than giving people something short to read.

56
00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:35.940
Once you have a first draft of your e-book written just go back through an edit the book for clarity

57
00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.850
and meaning you can even hire someone to do this as well.

58
00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:45.000
A perk is a great place to look for ebook editors who are very cheap so look for spots in there to add

59
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.340
structures if it can help with longer passages like you might want to write a chapter on let's say on

60
00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:56.400
page SEO factors in your new ebook so you could add section headers for each factor you cover so it

61
00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.050
could be Hetter tags.

62
00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.680
Link structure bullet lists and so on.

63
00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.230
We just wrote the SEO course.

64
00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:07.750
It just helps break up long content and makes it easier for people to scan if they're in a rush.

65
00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:12.780
Look for ways to call out key points you can use cold call outs if there's a particular line you want

66
00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.890
people to remember or focus on.

67
00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:20.330
Use bullet lists or checklist to rundown multiple items if you want to use a visual of some kind and

68
00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.490
you can create it using an online tool like the one I always talk about.

69
00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:29.730
Kanva can was really good for creating different kinds of visuals but one I found useful was the checklist

70
00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:34.110
template specifically that they have it's easy to sign up for Camma you just sign up through Facebook

71
00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.850
or Google account.

72
00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:35.350
It's FREE.

73
00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.910
Once you're there it's pretty easy to browse through different templates and edit them to create something

74
00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:43.320
that fits perfectly in your ebook and then obviously makes sure that everything you wrote makes sense.

75
00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.250
Read it out loud.

76
00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.280
Even that can actually help you spot any weirdness or mistakes.

77
00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:51.570
Remember it's was written conversationally have someone else read it and see if it makes sense to them.

78
00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:53.860
Is there anything that's glaringly missing.

79
00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:58.500
Designing your ebook is important but you're in luck because you can find hundreds of free templates

80
00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:59.890
online to get you started.

81
00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:06.390
I spotted some nice free ebook templates from Hubspot lucid press and even a blog called food blogger

82
00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:12.320
Central which has templates you can use in powerpoint to create a recipe ebook you know specifically

83
00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:13.030
what you want to do.

84
00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:14.450
We'll throw those in the resources.

85
00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:15.670
And that brings up a good point.

86
00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:21.540
If there's a specific topic you have in mind for your e-book a really quick Google search will do wonders.

87
00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:27.090
Just search for a free eBook template for cooking that helped me find the food bloggers one are not

88
00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:29.120
interested in food blogging but I've found pretty easily.

89
00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:35.120
Or you can just search for the program you want to use free ebook template and then word or Indesign

90
00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:38.840
or Google Docs or whatever it is you plan to make it in.

91
00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:42.830
There are just so many options out there that it's worth looking for something that fits your needs

92
00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:44.630
here laying out your ebook.

93
00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:47.830
You might find some pages are just packed with text.

94
00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.030
So again try to break it up with images.

95
00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:56.150
E-books can be very visual so insert a screenshot or something about what you're talking about.

96
00:05:56.150 --> 00:06:02.330
A sidebar maybe even to explain a related topic something worth going into or even even Unfortunately

97
00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:06.730
stock photos can make it better than just a block of text.

98
00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:09.200
If you want to try that out go to stock photo.

99
00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:13.770
It's probably the best way to do it or pick's Bay is usually you don't pay for them.

100
00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:14.800
You want a good tip here.

101
00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:19.430
Well come up with a theme for your images for the ebook including a cover image.

102
00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:22.520
Maybe your topic today is about ways to improve website usability.

103
00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:25.250
That doesn't mean every picture has to be of a website.

104
00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:29.480
Your theme could be something related like simplicity or even symmetry.

105
00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:34.880
Look for pictures on eyes stock or pics Bay or whatever that feel like a match for the topic or get

106
00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:38.750
inspiration and take pics take the actual pictures yourself or your camera person.

107
00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:44.100
Either I sprinkle in these images and choose a great one for your cover to make the theme really stick.

108
00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:47.620
As with white papers make sure your logo and branding is on the document.

109
00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:54.110
The cover the last page and at least every page in between should have something that they can identify

110
00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:55.360
you as the creator.

111
00:06:55.400 --> 00:07:00.920
The last page in fact usually has a general blurb about the author or the brand that produced the e-book

112
00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:03.830
so use that as a spot to drive people back to your Web site.

113
00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:08.720
Keep in mind that e-books can end up getting shared with others so use it as free advertising to keep

114
00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:12.130
the original reader and new ones coming back to your site.

115
00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:15.320
Speaking of your site well your ebook will need a landing page as well.

116
00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:20.060
The format should match what we did for white papers provide an intro clear expectations of what people

117
00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:25.640
will get when they download the ebook and break it out in a bullets to make it easy to understand set

118
00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:29.720
up clear expectations and your readers will be happy.

119
00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:32.290
I think got a valuable e-book you've created for them.

120
00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:32.750
Are you guys.

121
00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:38.170
That is if you guys want any more help or advice or want to share what you make posts in the slack.

122
00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:39.590
Otherwise I'll see you in the next lecture.
