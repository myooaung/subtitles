00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:01.530
All right guys welcome back.

2
00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.640
So far in this PR section of our course we've talked about how to get press coverage for your product

3
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.780
or business understanding reporters and their needs is a helpful part of figuring out how to pitch them

4
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.470
effectively so that in mind I've got four steps for getting coverage.

5
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:17.020
I want to discuss now those four steps are basically we got to find them.

6
00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.900
The writers the reporters got to research them learn what they like.

7
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:22.950
Contact them.

8
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:27.720
And we had to do that correctly and then we need to finally go in for the kill and work on our pitch.

9
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.570
In this lecture I want to talk about the first step and that's finding them.

10
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.400
So you're gonna get involved in these PR efforts first.

11
00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.450
You do follow and read articles and coverage from outlets in your industry or area.

12
00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.480
You have to know what's going on who people are talking about what competitors are doing especially

13
00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.300
who is writing about it all.

14
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:47.880
Are there big media blogs publishing multiple articles a day.

15
00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.400
Are there smaller blogs written by one person or they're posting once a week.

16
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.750
Whatever industry you're in.

17
00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.540
The answer is most likely yes.

18
00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:55.920
And so you need to find them.

19
00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.630
So let's consider a scenario here.

20
00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.390
Maybe you've invented a new kind of selfie stick.

21
00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.430
That's not completely lame or a hat that turns your iPhone into a GoPro.

22
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:04.780
I don't know.

23
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.370
So you've got your tech accessory.

24
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.180
Chances are you're following tech accessory blog sites and other sites that publish reviews and news

25
00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.520
and opinions about accessories for iPhones things like that.

26
00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.180
You're not already following these sources well it's time that you did.

27
00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.760
You need to be aware of what current events are happening and especially what's happening in your industry.

28
00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.680
So which websites blogs and media outlets do people go to for information about products like yours.

29
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.230
Start by listing them somewhere like in a spreadsheet.

30
00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.170
Now Google Sheets excel file.

31
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.250
It's going to do just fine.

32
00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:40.110
Start with those places and then try to check them out every day or follow them on Twitter or Facebook

33
00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.900
or if you want to subscribe to them via email.

34
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.660
Now who's got your attention when it comes to this industry.

35
00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:46.290
Content.

36
00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.910
Just make a list of those sites or outlets to first start off at this stage.

37
00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:52.730
Just write down what you can.

38
00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.600
Don't spend a lot of time really kind of needling through all their stuff to figure out which one is

39
00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.730
perfect for you.

40
00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.010
Now if you're finding that your list is short because you're only going off of things you've bookmarked

41
00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.060
or off the top of your head well jumped out to Google and look for some more.

42
00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.230
Now when you're doing this remember you're looking for relevant places not related ones.

43
00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:16.140
Now here's what I mean if you google tech accessories blog you might see Terry Wright from Adobe and

44
00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.370
his tech blog listed.

45
00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.560
Well the thing is even with thousands of followers his blog doesn't look like the right fit for you.

46
00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.260
If you make iPhone holders or accessories and it doesn't take long to figure this out.

47
00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:28.330
Look at his post titles.

48
00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.000
Just start scrolling through and read a couple of them or the navigation up top and you'll see it refers

49
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.930
to a lot of Adobe topics photography and well not iPhone accessories.

50
00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.660
So if something is not a clear and obvious fit either go to the next search result or try a different

51
00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:43.510
search term.

52
00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.630
If you go out to Google and try a new search term like iPhone accessories blog well you'll find more

53
00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.130
relevant places like this one.

54
00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.400
Here's one called Eye lounge.

55
00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.920
You can see they have a section called gear that list a bunch of iPhone related accessories and your

56
00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.630
phone holder hat or whatever thing you've invented could easily be listed here alongside other products

57
00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:01.590
they reviewed.

58
00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.860
Look for clear and obvious fits like this and then add those to your list.

59
00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.320
Now if you wanna make your search a little bit easier here's a quick tip.

60
00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.100
There's a website called all top a l l t OPI dot com.

61
00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:16.980
Now what they do is they combine and aggregate all the top blogs and outlets on a given subject hence

62
00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:22.530
the name all top all top can offer a great roundup of sites on a lot of different given subjects.

63
00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.090
And the iPhone section of all top for example can give you some helpful leads for relevant sites that

64
00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.100
write about iPhone products and businesses.

65
00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.980
Honestly just copy all of those ones down.

66
00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.380
They've kind of done the work for you.

67
00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.510
Try to give each source a look at a quick one by skimming the headlines.

68
00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.690
If you see something promising click through and then see if it might match the same time topic coverage.

69
00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.410
If that's the case then add it to your list.

70
00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:48.780
Now once you've got let's say I don't know 10 to 15 sites you want to go to each one and see who exactly

71
00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.400
is doing all the writing and reporting.

72
00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.320
Keep this in mind pitching to a blog or outlet is possible but you'll have a much better chance at being

73
00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.830
noticed if you pitch the individual writing stories instead.

74
00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:02.670
Now some blogs have a form that you can fill out but you really chance getting lost in a mountain of

75
00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:07.680
similar pitches reaching out to the individual reporter or the person behind the content is the better

76
00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:08.540
strategy here.

77
00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.210
And that's what we're doing in this lecture.

78
00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.490
So let's find these journalists.

79
00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.650
Let's go back to your list and then let's start with one source.

80
00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.140
What set that I lounge Web site and look at who's writing their reviews.

81
00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:23.490
Since there are a lot of different kinds of products you'd ideally look for a view about something like

82
00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:24.110
yours.

83
00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.880
Your product is unique like our iPhone Holder wearable whatever.

84
00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.860
Look for the closest thing either by looking for an article about a similar function or a part of a

85
00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:32.410
product.

86
00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.340
Now the purpose of our product is make videos more personal and interesting.

87
00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:40.400
So if we scroll through we see eye launch has reviews of like here's a wide angle lens.

88
00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:41.650
Let's give that one a look.

89
00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:46.070
We see that this is written by a guy named Jesse Holton and a link out to his Twitter profile shows

90
00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.010
he's a senior editor of Eye lounge.

91
00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.730
Okay now we've got something.

92
00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:55.110
Add this name to your spreadsheet next to eye instead of a vague idea of who might write about you.

93
00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:59.050
Now you've a name and a Twitter handle while you're on Twitter might as well go ahead and follow them.

94
00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:05.320
Now maybe just the perfect person on this site to write about you but if you just look at what he's

95
00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:08.380
written there's a good chance that this is kind of in his ballpark.

96
00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:09.770
Now if the site looks promising.

97
00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:11.950
Around more articles in search of other writers.

98
00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:16.540
If you find relevant matches that is if you find people writing about products like yours add them to

99
00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:17.290
your list.

100
00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:20.350
It's cool if you have multiple people for one outlet for the bigger sites.

101
00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:23.530
You might actually find a whole bunch of different writers for smaller ones.

102
00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:26.890
Maybe you find one good lead doesn't really matter either way.

103
00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:32.470
Add these people to your list even if your list of 10 to 15 sites returns 10 to 15 names.

104
00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:36.050
Now you're a lot closer to figuring out who to contact when you have a pitch in mind.

105
00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:40.930
This process of going through your reading list and Googling in search of new sources is a good first

106
00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:45.100
step to find the reporters and media members you want to pitch in for some reason you're having trouble

107
00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:46.800
finding these individual people.

108
00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:51.720
Well it's usually easy you find the articles you think match he usually gonna have a byline it's okay

109
00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:55.270
written by using click that person and you can go to their profile.

110
00:05:55.300 --> 00:06:00.520
Sorry you can't click that then just try searching within the site for that person's name search google

111
00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.480
for their name plus the Web site.

112
00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:07.150
If that doesn't work and have a specific enough name maybe you can just search their name and use that

113
00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:11.340
as a way to track down how you can find them on Twitter and contact them.

114
00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:14.260
Protip realize that Twitter is fantastic for press.

115
00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:20.920
Almost all people who write or do you press or reporters any kind of coverage at all are going to be

116
00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:22.630
on Twitter for whatever reason.

117
00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:27.580
Now of course we can also use tools that perform similar actions what we just did for example site called

118
00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:33.010
Buzz stream is an app that helps you create a database of prospects you connect with and contact gives

119
00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:37.150
you a mechanism to create campaigns or you can personally pitch people with influence in your industry.

120
00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:42.460
Now Buzz dream they have a free trial available but the lowest I think the plan is like 25 bucks a month

121
00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:46.540
which allows you to track up to 1000 contacts which is an enormous amount of people.

122
00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:49.810
It's a great system for tracking it especially you're going to take PR seriously.

123
00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:51.330
It's a great way to handle this.

124
00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:57.040
I'm not super organized so I usually use some type of management system like this that can help me no

125
00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:57.710
shortcuts.

126
00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:01.810
Speaking of shortcuts is in our service called just reach out and it's another service where you type

127
00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:06.610
in a keyword that describes your startup with the name of a competitor and then it shows you a list

128
00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:10.930
of journalists that have written about it or something similar then you can email those journalists

129
00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:13.380
using templates they provide to pitch yourself.

130
00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:15.230
Now this one is a little bit more pricey.

131
00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:18.790
Cost sixty five dollars a month and higher depending on how much you need to service.

132
00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:22.360
However you know they have a database and that does actually save you a lot of time.

133
00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:27.520
If I have a very specific angle I mean the alternative is a goodly sites that I think might possibly

134
00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:31.360
cover this angle then dig around till I find someone who might have touched on it.

135
00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:35.890
It basically takes a lot of time what they've done is just use an algorithm to kind of match people

136
00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:37.910
to certain keywords so keep that in mind.

137
00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:43.420
Their database might be outdated and it might not be perfectly accurate but it could save you a lot

138
00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:43.930
of time.

139
00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:48.640
Now the question is just then does it save you sixty five dollars a month worth of time.

140
00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:50.200
Depends how serious you are about PR.

141
00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:54.520
If you're ready to jump into a higher level of research and PR outreach well tools like these might

142
00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:58.960
be worth considering but for a lot of you watching this lecture I feel like the spreadsheet list and

143
00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:03.670
research is actually just a great way to get your hands dirty and review your industry at the same time.

144
00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:08.140
And our next lecture will get into the next step in this process where we look at our list of reporters

145
00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:11.100
and get to know them a bit better looking for stronger matches.

146
00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:11.720
Sound good.

147
00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:13.030
Okay see you in the next 1.
