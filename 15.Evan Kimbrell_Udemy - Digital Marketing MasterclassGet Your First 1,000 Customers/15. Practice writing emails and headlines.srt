1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,480
All right guys welcome back.

2
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:06,180
In our last I actually went over that all important step of broadening the actual pitch e-mail to use

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:07,310
in our PR efforts.

4
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:11,350
Now in this lecture Let's practice what we've gone over so everybody knows how it's done.

5
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:11,850
Good.

6
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:13,770
All right now think about this scenario.

7
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:18,780
Let's say we've got a web design agency and a few of our clients are local businesses and we're looking

8
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:21,840
to bring on some more of those types of clients.

9
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:25,770
Starting with a goal in mind always helps focus our ideas and any pitch we create.

10
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:30,060
In this case we're going to reach out to a local reporter who writes about business and marketing.

11
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:35,820
Our hope is that they'll use the US as a source for a story and if we get close to it it will put us

12
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,690
on the radar of local businesses.

13
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,280
So we make a list of local writers who can help us out.

14
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:43,460
And one of them is Jennifer from big city news dot com.

15
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:46,590
We've made a list of topics she covers and followed her on social media.

16
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:50,430
Now we haven't had a chance to send any messages her way so our pitch e-mail is going to be a little

17
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:51,150
bit cold.

18
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:53,680
More than likely she probably doesn't know who we are.

19
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:57,080
So it's appeal to Jennifer with a comment about one of her recent posts.

20
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:00,360
Now the type of post you'd like to be featured in or interviewed for.

21
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,180
All right so the subject we might try something like mobile marketing.

22
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:05,330
Post question and then the actual e-mail put.

23
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:10,920
Hi Jennifer I read your work on big city news site and the five tips for Mobile Marketing posts was

24
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:11,760
especially good.

25
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,950
I forwarded your post onto my local web design clients letting them know they should be paying attention

26
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:17,900
to your advice.

27
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:18,570
There you go.

28
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:23,010
You just gratified them made them happy showed that you actually pay attention to some of the stuff

29
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:23,490
they do.

30
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:28,170
I'm the founder of sweet design agency and I'm looking to help our local businesses as well.

31
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:31,860
Do you ever see a source for one of your posts on Web sites or small business marketing.

32
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:37,380
I'd love be happy to share my experience working with over a dozen different clients in the city just

33
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:37,940
let me know.

34
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:38,850
All the best.

35
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:40,980
Bob Smith founder sweet design.

36
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:46,260
So yeah I know your name's Bob an email like this requires some research to see which posts they've

37
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:50,580
written that are especially relevant to you but if you follow these writers the process really shouldn't

38
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:55,590
be that difficult on the subject line Mobile Marketing post question touches on a subject they're interested

39
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:55,940
in.

40
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:59,080
And it leaves it a little bit mysterious that being completely vague.

41
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:02,530
Obviously experiment with these titles is probably going to work forever.

42
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:06,780
Now I put in that word question and said something like Reclast because I didn't want to sound like

43
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:11,790
I was going to ask for something even though I did end up doing that and I started the email by establishing

44
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:16,700
I read Jennifer's work and I share it with my clients to try and get her on my side.

45
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:19,040
I'm saying like hey I helped you already.

46
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:23,840
My goal for the second part about being a source just follows that lead you do this great work writing.

47
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:24,960
I also do similar work.

48
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:29,510
Let's combine forces make a note though I specifically mentioned a couple of topics.

49
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:35,040
I said web sites or small business marketing that I could actually be helpful with.

50
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,400
Be specific so they don't have to guess what you can help with.

51
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,060
They're not going to do the research on you to figure out oh hey they might actually be an expert in

52
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,080
these 15 things.

53
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:47,340
Now let's assume you've actually met Jennifer at a local that maybe has a local business mixer or a

54
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:51,010
conference or something or you introduce yourself and briefly talked about your company.

55
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:55,680
If you make a connection like this well you don't have to build a request around your love of her work.

56
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:58,130
Just remind her of the shared experience you had instead.

57
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,750
So it might go something like this.

58
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:00,300
Subject.

59
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,280
Great to meet you.

60
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,010
Hi Jennifer.

61
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:04,780
Great meeting you today at the Chamber of Commerce seminar.

62
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:08,060
I'm glad I got a chance to tell you about my company suite design.

63
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,020
But I just wanted to add one more thing.

64
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:15,110
I've worked a bunch of local clients and I always point them towards the post on big city news.

65
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:18,150
And if you're ever looking for a local source Feel free to reach out.

66
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:23,700
I'd be happy to share my experience working over a dozen clients you know in the city on a Web site

67
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:25,780
or small business marketing just let me know.

68
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,430
All the best.

69
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:27,180
Mr. Bob.

70
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,980
BOB SMITH Very similar content in Vibe friendly.

71
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:31,590
Making an offer being polite.

72
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:36,320
All that stuff mentioning the event and how you met helps that person you write remember who you are

73
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:40,890
even if they forget the offer is basically the same as the last one though with less explanation since

74
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:44,190
you already got a chance to tell her who you are and what you do.

75
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:45,630
This is pretty straightforward.

76
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:49,540
Now let's do a different scenario sort of looking to be featured in an article or as a source let's

77
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:52,450
say of a new product coming out and you're actually looking for coverage now.

78
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:56,130
You want to approach a journalist who writes about your kind of tack and see if you can get featured

79
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:57,540
in an article in some way.

80
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:03,120
Let's say you have an app called workout beats with a Z that creates a custom Spotify playlists based

81
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,360
on workout activity from your Nike or some other workout app.

82
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:12,420
Now workout beats can analyze your activity like when you say speed up or cool down and finds the best

83
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,630
songs to match your tempo.

84
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:18,810
We've got a reporter that reviews work out and health apps and they've done some research and well you've

85
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:23,370
got an updated version of the app and it's launching soon and it's so much better than Spotify.

86
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,290
So here might be an email Subject.

87
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:26,640
Work out beats update.

88
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,600
Hey Damon I'm just guessing a name.

89
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:35,580
My name is joaquÃ­n from work out beats our app creates custom workout playlist based on your data matching

90
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,480
songs to your physical activity and tempo.

91
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:42,400
We're announcing a big update next week we think you and your readers have really like putting new playlists

92
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:49,380
options which connect with Spotify Pandora and Nike Plus you can learn more at work out beats MS press

93
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,130
like a free trial.

94
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:52,640
The app just let me know and I'd love to set you up with it.

95
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:54,350
Many thanks Joaquin.

96
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:55,140
And then your e-mail.

97
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:58,890
All right so take a second and think to yourself was that a good one or a bad one.

98
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:03,610
What would you have done differently for the most part we got the information out that's important and

99
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:06,670
we kind of hit home why the person should care.

100
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:09,590
We know they write about this topic we know their audience would like it.

101
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:10,810
Here's what's cool about it.

102
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,070
Here's what it does.

103
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:16,840
The only thing that I would say you might want to change is the fact that there's no personalization

104
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:22,090
you could have written that to literally anyone and you didn't talk about that person very much at all.

105
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:27,100
You really should start off by saying something along the lines of like this is not a template e-mail

106
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:28,900
and you do that by saying anything.

107
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,060
I don't know how all of that article you wrote here.

108
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:32,710
Hey I thought this tweet was funny.

109
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:33,990
Hey is this you here.

110
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:34,900
Whatever.

111
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:40,270
Anyway so very quickly offering the important details who you are what your app does where they can

112
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:42,580
go to learn more and even offer to try out the app.

113
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:46,540
Now there are multiple paths they can choose reply back directly to you.

114
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:47,380
Then go to your press.

115
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,120
Are out or things download the app for themselves.

116
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:54,940
Overall just remember keep these pitched emails short and concise even if the recipients already know

117
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:58,720
you you have to remember reporters are super busy so really get to the point.

118
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:03,580
Be helpful and offer value especially with their audience in mind and always give them something to

119
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:07,870
do like the link they can follow or an offer with an email address they can follow up with.

120
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:10,500
Now if you send out your emails to journalists but don't hear back.

121
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:14,800
Honestly don't be to discourage reporters again are really really busy but also just trying to make

122
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,740
sure not to get super aggressive because you may be at this for a while.

123
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:23,500
It could be weeks or even months before a reporter actually gets back to you now making connections

124
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,440
is a long term process so get to work on your research.

125
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:29,100
Engagement with reporters as soon as you can identify them.

126
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:33,600
I'd also say it's worth mentioning that you should always try to follow up.

127
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:34,520
This is what I generally like to do.

128
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:39,700
I like to follow up twice and I try to do the second follow up maybe two days later and the third one

129
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:42,560
maybe a week later and each time I write a follow up.

130
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:46,440
It gets shorter and shorter and really just says is like Hey did you see this.

131
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:49,360
Here's two sentences explaining again.

132
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,770
Third one just says hey are you interested at all.

133
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:54,700
If not well it's like no hard feelings.

134
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:55,190
All right guys.

135
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,440
I will see you in the next lecture.
