1
00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:01.380
All right we're back.

2
00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:03.200
Let's keep pushing forward on onwards.

3
00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.740
Now our last lecture we discussed a way to figure out your and Budget and different options for bid

4
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:08.520
strategies.

5
00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.130
Now we're at the part of the process where you connect the keywords you want to target with the ads

6
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.640
that will show up for you and your product.

7
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.300
This is where you create what outwards calls your ad groups what you'll end up creating an ad where

8
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.400
it is a list of relevant keywords.

9
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.130
Ads you create for your campaign and info about the landing pages where the ads should lead to.

10
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.090
Now keep in mind it's best to focus on one goal at a time.

11
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:37.310
Increasing sales for one product or let's say getting clicks for one specific page.

12
00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.970
Don't try to do both with one and focus your AD group or on one specific goal.

13
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.460
So let's continue with our onwards campaign set up.

14
00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.340
We were looking at our last lecture.

15
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.550
We're now looking at the CRE and groups page in the first field you'll see that you are Alpher your

16
00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.980
landing page for this ad when people click through your and this is where they're going to go to.

17
00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:58.480
If you don't have this page ready yet it's fine.

18
00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:05.130
Check off the my landing page is it ready box and you can design that later if you do well and or you

19
00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.990
are already there.

20
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.340
Now the next step is to name your AD group and start entering keywords you're targeting for your goal.

21
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.840
In our example here we have that Wi-Fi enabled Scooter you're trying to sell.

22
00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.700
So we've got a list of keywords to help us concentrate on that goal.

23
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.290
I'm going to assume you've done your keyword research but if you haven't and you need tips check out

24
00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.310
my lecture on it.

25
00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.740
Back in the c section of this course.

26
00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.870
Seriously it's not really worth going over because it's the exact same process you would do for us to

27
00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:36.750
go find the ones that are specific to your product or your audience and then make sure you read out

28
00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:44.490
the ones that might actually just be a translation error or just not specifically what you're targeting.

29
00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.240
So once you have your keywords enter them here one per line.

30
00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:54.030
Here's the one I'm using for the smart scooter at rehab smart scooter childs Scooter Scooter Wi-Fi scooter

31
00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.520
tracker scooter mileage like razor scooter Scroogie PSN razor GPA.

32
00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.860
But the key words you see here are broad keywords.

33
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.600
That means Google will consider your ad a match if someone enters a search term that includes the terms

34
00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.150
or terms that are similar.

35
00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.680
Kind of like if one of your keywords is bicycle lock and someone types and bike lock.

36
00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.700
OK well Google will know that they mean the same thing.

37
00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.190
So let them do that.

38
00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.440
Then you can also set a couple of other types of matches with their keywords.

39
00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.990
If you need to know an exact match as a keyword set with square brackets around it like this.

40
00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.430
OK so I put bike lock in square brackets.

41
00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.550
Now someone types and either bike lock or bicycle lock.

42
00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:39.630
Well it will match but if someone types in green bike lock or bike lock sale Well it will not match.

43
00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.950
Now you can also set a phrase Manchus in quotes like this.

44
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.730
So put bike lock in quotes.

45
00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:49.770
Now that will force Google to look for matches with keywords that include the term with words in that

46
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:50.300
order.

47
00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.600
So green bike clock would match but lock your bike would not.

48
00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:55.410
You know what I'm saying.

49
00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.610
In some cases there might be some search terms out there that you don't want people to find you on.

50
00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:07.290
Take schizm for example of that app that you open it and listen to a song and it tells you based on

51
00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.840
the song's melody what you're listening to.

52
00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.080
Now I could possibly be talking on the app that plays music.

53
00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:19.290
Or I could be referring to a comic book where the superhero yells Shiism whenever he punches people

54
00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.050
or it's shazam the movie.

55
00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.960
God what's the basketball player was Shaquille O'Neal.

56
00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.380
I think that's what happens anyway.

57
00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:31.320
If the Shazam app people have an AD group of their own well it makes sense for them to filter out those

58
00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:37.920
comic book fans when they search for Shazam along with terms like comic so they use what we call a negative

59
00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.090
keyword to do this.

60
00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.610
Put in the term with a minus sign before it like minus comic or minus cartoon.

61
00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:50.970
And then any of the loose matches that include these words will be filtered out most really helps focus

62
00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.640
your AD group and the audience who will see your ad.

63
00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.200
This is obviously crucial because this is a large part of the optimization on your campaigns.

64
00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:03.590
Now you might not spot all the fine tuning and your keywords immediately and that's perfectly fine.

65
00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:08.400
But over time what you'll do is you look at how each search term is performing and you might notice

66
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.710
some of them are just not working well that case maybe you search it and see what the other search results

67
00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:15.870
are or just kind of think about it.

68
00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.040
Does this actually match what I'm doing now you just starting out.

69
00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:21.480
Well I suggest you stick with broad matches.

70
00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:26.160
Type in your keywords as is and don't include any of the modifiers I just mentioned.

71
00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.320
Google pretty good at figuring this out for you.

72
00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:33.110
But once you start getting feedback and stats look over you should be able to see some of the keyword

73
00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:38.580
phrases people use to find and then click on you then it could actually be a good idea to go back and

74
00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:44.010
include some of those exact phrases as part of your ADD group to really kind of hone in on the people

75
00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:45.230
that you're looking for.

76
00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:50.940
And oh yeah one last thing Google knows people misspell stuff all the time so they will automatically

77
00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:52.080
correct things for them.

78
00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:57.840
Like if someone typed in Coke recipe Google knows that they want to make pancakes.

79
00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:02.120
Google doesn't assume that they're trying to make a Kokane pancake.

80
00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:06.520
So you do not need to put in all the possible misspelled versions of your keyword that take you for

81
00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:07.460
ever anyway.

82
00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:12.530
And once you enter your own keywords you should see some ideas appear over on the right under the get

83
00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:14.420
add group ideas form.

84
00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:15.820
Go ahead and check them out.

85
00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:18.990
Or if you're curious what a competitor might be targeting you can enter.

86
00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:20.980
There you l and see what it returns.

87
00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:27.790
If we put in the U R L for our competitor razor razor scooter you can see keywords for electric scooters.

88
00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:32.780
Click to expand it and I'll show you more related keywords and monthly search volume.

89
00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:36.190
I'll bet they might see some possibilities in there you didn't consider before.

90
00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:41.210
Once you're satisfied with your group the next step is to create the ad that people will see.

91
00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:44.230
So before we jump to that let's just pause right here.

92
00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:49.340
You're following along this will give you a chance to get your own keyword list together and start pruning

93
00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:50.200
it if you want to.

94
00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:51.930
Then I'll see you in the next lecture.

95
00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:53.830
Start talking to the actual ad itself.
