00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.300
Hey guys welcome back to the course.

2
00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.080
So in our last few lectures we talked about some of the more technical ways to improve.

3
00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:12.510
SC Oh and before that we discussed writing and code and all of the things you do on each page on this

4
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:15.790
lecture I to discuss things you can do that involve other Web sites.

5
00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:18.120
What are the most important indicators of a page's value.

6
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:22.990
How many links it has to it from external sources or other people's websites.

7
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.320
Talk about there's a little bit of back and content marketing and we liked it then because someone links

8
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.040
to your site.

9
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.470
Well people might click that and come find your site.

10
00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.950
But in SC We like it for an entirely different reason because it tells Google your page might be important.

11
00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:40.120
Now I want to talk with the ways to increase that number of links those inbound links.

12
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.170
Practice many people call it link building.

13
00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.810
Now in the past link building has been kind of a dirty SEO tactic and not by any fault of people trying

14
00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:50.470
to legitimately get links.

15
00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:55.530
Some weirdos would go out and basically create fake Web site with links to their site just to build

16
00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.310
up their numbers.

17
00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:02.160
They also would got to like directory Web sites that list out millions of sites and then use those and

18
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.680
just insert them into hundreds in different different resource pages and then even actually got worse

19
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.370
some people would pay for links or pay people to do these things for them.

20
00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.720
So basically it gave link building really bad name but Google still knows that when people link to another

21
00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.810
site it's generally an endorsement of that site and its value.

22
00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.790
Three Google treats link building is constantly evolving because they're trying to deal with that problem

23
00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.170
of some people still abuse it.

24
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.830
So in general there's things like building you need to avoid.

25
00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.450
And then there are things that are perfectly legitimate and you should absolutely do.

26
00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:35.920
Now first off get in the habit of linking to other sites in your articles in your post.

27
00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.940
If those sites are paying attention well they may link back to you with the thing.

28
00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:41.490
Or just to be polite.

29
00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.960
If they're not paying attention well you can ping them on social media and let them know you're a fan

30
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.240
or that you like their service or whatever.

31
00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.530
Maybe you can also just tell them stop ignoring me.

32
00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.150
That could compel them to give you a link back.

33
00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.270
Now asking to Google for a link is another way to just simply do it.

34
00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.270
I wouldn't recommend going to people cold.

35
00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.470
But if you know them personally or have had some interactions on social media perhaps approaching someone

36
00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.280
with a blog or a Web site and asking for a link generally isn't a bad idea.

37
00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:14.400
You know obviously say give me link you say I made this specifically to help this person solve this

38
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.090
problem.

39
00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.420
This blog post of yours is generally targeting the same type of person.

40
00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.230
I think this could be a nice addition because of this in content marketing.

41
00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.550
Anyway be prepared of course to promise them the link in return.

42
00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.530
Another way to do this is to schedule a day of the week where you actively promote content from other

43
00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.900
sites.

44
00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.500
Not unlike those like hashtags follow Friday things people sometimes do on Twitter.

45
00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:41.880
Look for a complimentary blog or web site like if you offer web design services you might mention in

46
00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.550
your post that are looking for logo design should check out this graphic designers blog.

47
00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.780
In return you could ask the same graphic designer to mention you at some point when he's recommending

48
00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.590
web designers to his own clients.

49
00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.620
So on a related note you could ask for a product or service review instead of just asking for a plain

50
00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.980
link.

51
00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.510
Ask for a review.

52
00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:04.180
Well it makes a little bit more sense if you want to get a link from a blogger or writer.

53
00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.070
You could send them a free sample or a code to use an online service for free.

54
00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.920
But be sure to ask them to include a link in the review.

55
00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:11.820
Kind of goes without saying.

56
00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.650
Now another way to generate links is to find places that link to mini sites like yourselves look for

57
00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:22.620
listin resource pages on different blogs at Web sites like this one here says offering 100 links to

58
00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.360
web development resources.

59
00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.850
Now this is different than what I was talking about before with or essentially link farms and link farm

60
00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:35.370
might be a site that just has millions of links and the page itself has nothing on it.

61
00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:40.320
Nothing of value that's different than someone who actually has an active blog has their own following

62
00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.080
and then creates a resource page because they think that's useful.

63
00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.050
Now maybe you created a great text editor you want to promote.

64
00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.320
So you might look for people who have made list about say programming resources.

65
00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:54.960
You know since coders often use text editors to write or clean up their code.

66
00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:59.640
This web development resources page has a section on text editors so you might reach out and ask to

67
00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.480
be considered for the list as well.

68
00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:07.320
Just say hey I know you wrote this at this time but since then I've made this and I think it's better

69
00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:08.430
for x y reason.

70
00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.630
By the way it takes some time to actually search for your competitors as well.

71
00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:16.160
See who links to those guys and then see if it's possible to get a link from the same source.

72
00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:19.830
It could be on a page with a list of similar companies or products.

73
00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:21.450
It's kind of like sky scraping.

74
00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:22.800
Are we talking about content marketing.

75
00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:28.740
You write something better than what you do is you go and find all the people who links to the now inferior

76
00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.550
posts and you basically ask them hey I made a better one.

77
00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:32.700
Can you update your link.

78
00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:33.330
Very similar.

79
00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.900
You can do what competitors go after their competitors and try the same thing.

80
00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.620
If you want to find links to your competitors try to use that Web site.

81
00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.350
We use a forfeitures h raft start com.

82
00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:43.260
They're usually pretty good.

83
00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.460
There's also a bunch of other ones you can try.

84
00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:46.440
Usually they're free.

85
00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:51.120
So in addition to whatever regular marketing or social promotion you might do these strategies can help

86
00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.850
you with your link building efforts.

87
00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:53.670
Find something that works.

88
00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:55.950
Keep at it but don't just do things once.

89
00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:00.690
Create a system for yourself for every week or every month you do some kind of outreach and each time

90
00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:04.440
you publish a post think of the opportunities for connecting with people in your industry.

91
00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:04.860
All right guys.

92
00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.400
That's all for Link Building for now.

93
00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:12.060
You can take an entire course on link building but these are kind of the best practices in the general

94
00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:13.760
overview that you need to understand.

95
00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.520
You should be able to actually go out and try it again past that point.

96
00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.170
You have to have an entirely different course.

97
00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:20.990
Anyway I'm going to see you guys in the next lecture.
