00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:01,650
Hey guys welcome back.

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:07,650
So we talked about e-mail courses directly in our last lecture but they are there benefits and who might

3
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:09,270
use them to generate leads.

4
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:11,580
So now let's actually discuss how you create them.

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:15,660
The first question to ask here is what exactly should you teach.

6
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:19,860
You generally want to pick a topic you are great at something you understand front to back.

7
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:23,930
That would be relevant to your audience and something they'd like to understand better.

8
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:26,710
Also needs to translate well to the email format.

9
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:32,070
So that your topic required the use of say a lot of visuals and you might want to consider something

10
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:32,540
else.

11
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:40,500
Now information you can communicate over e-mails is basically text interspersed with images occasionally

12
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,000
and then external links.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,590
That's the ideal for e-mail.

14
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:48,290
So for example let's say you were Treloar and you offer a platform to allow people to organize projects

15
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,090
ideas and virtual boards and list.

16
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:54,090
Basically you're all about project management productivity.

17
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:59,640
You offered an e-mail course on project management or productivity generally makes sense or you could

18
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:06,630
focus on a related topic Dollar Shave Club it's a company that offers subscription raisers like they

19
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:13,650
mail it to you for instance do an e-mail course on all the round man escaping shaving hair care skin

20
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:14,840
care all that stuff.

21
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:18,110
These are generally topics their audience would probably appreciate.

22
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,980
So what would you specifically create.

23
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:24,660
Well what's your business or product all about what purpose does it serve for your audience.

24
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:28,980
Once you have a topic in mind you'll need to think about the design and the scope of the course.

25
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:35,490
I've seen a lot of recommendations to make an e-mail or somewhere between five to seven lessons or basically

26
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:37,320
something that would take a week to complete.

27
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:41,670
Now it makes sense and it makes for a good selling point as well for people who are too busy to learn

28
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:44,520
something quickly and they can only do small amounts at a time.

29
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:49,670
We've also seen longer courses work as well as in 15 day courses 25 day courses.

30
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:53,530
I've even seen like perpetual never ending courses that are year long.

31
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:56,780
Really it just depends on how qualified you want the leads to be right.

32
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:59,800
Because you gonna be able to monitor who makes it through the entire course.

33
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:06,030
The longer ones fewer people will get through but the ones that do are going to be way more likely to

34
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:11,450
be a purchaser of your stuff and you're trying this for the first time I'd say trying a short one tried

35
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:15,690
doing like a five day course and then you see roughly how your audience likes it.

36
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,220
So think about your topic.

37
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:20,640
Let's say you're an app designer or maybe a usability expert of some kind.

38
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:24,840
You might choose a topic like how to perform let's say usability testing for your app.

39
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,440
The level of detail you go into is really up to you.

40
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:32,100
But let's say you wanted to do that quick five day email cause your task at this point should be to

41
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:37,740
start outlining how can you carve up this topic into five pieces that make sense where each one logically

42
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:38,730
follows the other.

43
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:39,910
Maybe you should do it like this.

44
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:45,120
Day one why you should do usability testing for your app then in this case you talk about the benefits

45
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,760
and what you could plan on learning from it then you could talk about in day to preparing to test what

46
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:54,630
you need to do in advance to guarantee a good test and helpful results.

47
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:58,080
Then rolling on day three let's say you do running a test.

48
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:58,670
How to do it.

49
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,730
What to look for things to try and so on then day four.

50
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,120
You could say interpreting the results.

51
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,220
What did you actually learn.

52
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:10,260
And then finally number five would be something like improving your app how to take the test results

53
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:14,730
and make the right changes and then outline right there while that could be a type of promotional copy.

54
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:19,530
You serve up on your landing page but for preparing your email course an outline lets you figure out

55
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:23,530
how deep each part needs to be which impacts the length of each email.

56
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:26,690
When it comes to email link there are two schools of thought here.

57
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:30,460
Option one is to keep each email short like 300 words short.

58
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:35,310
Now what's great about that length is that it really doesn't take that much time to read or write and

59
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:37,590
it can really help you keep your momentum going.

60
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:40,610
Just think so it finishes your e-mail and the next one arise.

61
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,140
Well they'll be ready to read that one as well.

62
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:47,310
Now if your e-mails are too long they might stack up in their inbox without being read.

63
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:52,950
But he really likes that the option to for email is to actually purposely make the e-mails longer like

64
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:54,480
a thousand words or more.

65
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:59,430
The advantage here is that you can fit more detail more information making the emails more substantial

66
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:00,650
perhaps more valuable.

67
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:03,620
That means more people will like it more people will share it.

68
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:08,130
So our e-mails are like the individual bits of knowledge but the long ones are more like deep reference

69
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:10,580
material you keep for a long time.

70
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,980
You refer to it later and you might actually learn something from it.

71
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,200
Now the length of your emails really just depends on your topic.

72
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:21,810
For example here's a course on writing from Heidrick due to my I'm not going to guess his name.

73
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:26,850
Anyway she's a writer from the United Kingdom and she's got a 16 part course she describes as snack

74
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:33,060
Apple where each email lesson is ultra short with easy to implement tips and each lesson is only a couple

75
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:33,780
hundred words.

76
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:40,200
Well it focuses on one tip or lesson and that's really all it's simple and focus so the short format

77
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,570
probably works here but instead for our e-mail course on app usability testing.

78
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:48,980
I could probably see the emails being quite a bit longer especially if you wanted to squeeze them into

79
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,540
say like a five day course.

80
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:56,490
Then again if we expanded it to a 20 day course like four weeks Monday through Friday maybe then we

81
00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:01,050
could do more of that snack bowl format and keep the messages short obviously a balance you have to

82
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,900
figure out now regardless of length.

83
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:08,250
Each email should feel substantial enough and deliver enough value within the course.

84
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:13,050
Consider how much you ask the reader to do in each email as well to give them many steps to follow or

85
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:14,520
try on their own.

86
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:18,810
Is it reasonable that they complete them by the time the next email arrives.

87
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:24,330
Make sure you plan out these steps and tasks in your overall outline and then divide them up evenly

88
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:25,370
throughout your emails.

89
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:31,220
Once you have a solid outline and an idea how long each email lesson should be write it up similarly

90
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,570
each message in whatever writing app you want really doesn't matter word Google Docs.

91
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:39,480
You just be taking the text and then copying it into emails you create later.

92
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:44,340
Speaking of which once your material is written ready to go well then you can actually create the email

93
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:49,310
course and that happens on any type of email service provider of course.

94
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:53,520
The one reference before was a Weber and they have a 19 dollar a month account that you could use with

95
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,660
a 30 day trial.

96
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:58,680
An alternative would be a place called drip which has a free account that allows you to do this up to

97
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,590
100 subscribers.

98
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:01,230
But if you go over that then you have to pay.

99
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:05,790
Now here's what an email course in drip would look like while you set up an automation campaign that

100
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:07,120
looks something like this.

101
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:10,020
People who submit a specific sign up form get added to a list.

102
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,420
They get a confirmation email.

103
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:15,970
Then the first lesson and a new lesson each day after the first one with drip you can virtually set

104
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:21,300
up the whole automation campaign like this one editing each email to include the material and then telling

105
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:27,540
drip to wait a day to deliver the next one at a specific time or even skipping days or weekends if you

106
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:32,730
want to make first confirmation email should be something simple that quickly sets the stage for what's

107
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:33,730
to come next.

108
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:36,870
You're doing a swift app development course.

109
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,240
Maybe you'd write something like this.

110
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:42,450
Thanks so much for signing up for my course mobile app development using swift this course will last

111
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:47,250
10 days and I'll send you a new lesson each day by the end you'll have everything you need to build

112
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:50,270
your first app using swift and get it into the App Store.

113
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:55,590
Some quick notes before you begin the chorus please download this and this from this link.

114
00:06:55,590 --> 00:07:00,540
These are examples that you'll need to follow along with another thing each lesson should take you 10

115
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:01,770
to 15 minutes to complete.

116
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:04,650
If you fall behind don't worry if you have questions let me know.

117
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:10,290
Drop me a line it help at this course dot com if you know any questions and I'll get back to you ASAP.

118
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:13,830
The point is use your confirmation to make sure people are prepped and ready to go.

119
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:19,440
The first lesson when it arrives don't make them pause during the middle to download something or perform

120
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,740
some action you should have prepared them for.

121
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:25,380
Now take advantage of the fact that when they sign up they're the most motivated.

122
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:27,900
So get them to put their foot in the water first.

123
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,970
After you send your confirmation email follow up the first lesson.

124
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:35,870
Make sure that person immediately gets something so they can begin the experience of the course.

125
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:40,680
Set up your campaign and your email tool to deliver the next lessons as promised and then at the end

126
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,190
sent a thank you message.

127
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:46,520
Share links to resources if necessary promote more courses sell more staff.

128
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:49,820
Ask them to please write a review or recommend the course to a friend.

129
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:53,700
Whatever you're able to get from them make that request here while you still have their attention.

130
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:56,340
When it comes to how often email should arrive.

131
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:57,500
Well you could send them.

132
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:59,970
Let's say one day or one every two days.

133
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:04,560
It's certainly a selling point to say you can learn responsive email design in one week and then in

134
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,170
that case you deliver 7 emails in 7 days.

135
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:11,880
Technically that's a mission accomplished but you could also do one email a week though if you only

136
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,790
go that route and make sure your emails are all more substantial.

137
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:19,490
Or my favorite email courses is called Hack design and it's like an email.

138
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:25,920
I believe once a week for forever and every single emails written by a different designer whatever you

139
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:30,620
do set up those expectations on your landing page and be clear about how often the emails are gonna

140
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:31,370
come.

141
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,510
So that's your email course from a high level point of view.

142
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:38,180
As for each individual lesson you want your emails to be as simple as possible.

143
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:43,620
I recommend making your messages text only use a simple email design and only basic formatting like

144
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:47,940
headers bullet list and bold and italics text in general.

145
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:54,630
Try to avoid using too many images because 1 it makes it harder for your email to get delivered more

146
00:08:54,630 --> 00:09:00,180
often will go to spam and also people read this on their phone so it's often hard to format that correctly.

147
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:03,230
So prepare for the very simple and easy to read design.

148
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:07,800
Now a subject line for your email should be consistent and as short as possible of course is how to

149
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:12,600
generate leads through Facebook for instance helps you establish a short version of the title in your

150
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,950
confirmation email after person signs up.

151
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:17,880
That way when they see the subject line they know exactly what it is.

152
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:22,170
They don't skip it over like you might wanna send a confirmation email with the subject line course

153
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:27,840
registration for how to generate leads through Facebook and then your lesson email subject lines could

154
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:31,950
look like this in brackets you could put the abbreviation for that course.

155
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:35,060
Lesson 1 identifying your audience then the same thing.

156
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:38,010
Listen to the wrath of the content and so on.

157
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:41,810
Once you've got your course written and created in your email provider it's time to promote it.

158
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:45,250
Share a link to the landing page where people can sign up for it on social media.

159
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:50,340
Your other emails or you know take out some Facebook Google or other ads recover later in the course

160
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,700
by driving people to this course.

161
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:56,170
You can generate subscribers and more interest in everything else you have to offer.

162
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:59,610
Look for feedback from your course takers and look for ways to improve it.

163
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:05,220
Or change up the format or linked the email provider you go with should also give you metrics to look

164
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:11,100
at regarding the course such as how many people stuck with the entire course over time and that is it.

165
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,920
Best of luck with creating your course and I'll see you in the next lecture.
