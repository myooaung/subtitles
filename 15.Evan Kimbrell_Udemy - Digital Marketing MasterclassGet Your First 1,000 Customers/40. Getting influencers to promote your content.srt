1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,190
All right guys welcome back to the Corps.

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:06,870
We're going to talk about influencers so I just started about promoting your content using basically

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:07,770
social media.

4
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:13,580
You all have social media platforms whether there's not a lot of followers of a lot of followers.

5
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:15,300
It's basically free advertisement.

6
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:20,310
And if you don't post on there and you don't do it correctly with a post scheduling tool well then you're

7
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:22,190
basically a noob and you're screwing this up.

8
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:27,240
And social media is probably the first thing a lot of people think when they think of promoting blog

9
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,780
pieces or videos.

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,480
Oh I'm just going to throw a link out there on Twitter and see if people share it.

11
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:36,150
That's pretty much the baseline amount of work you should do.

12
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:38,410
Well the thing with sharing and promotion is this.

13
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:43,410
The bigger you are in the industry the more established your reputation is the better your chances are

14
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:47,520
that your tweets or post or other promotional stuff gets shared.

15
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:53,310
So if you are in quote unquote influencer or you can get it influence or to share your content.

16
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:55,080
It can be very helpful.

17
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,390
Now what exactly is an influencer.

18
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:01,410
Basically it's just someone with real sway in the industry.

19
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:05,860
They're popular because they have thousands or even millions of followers.

20
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:07,310
There's stuff get shared a lot.

21
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,380
And they themselves get mentioned or quoted frequently.

22
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:14,070
Influencers now are usually thought of as high profile people.

23
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:20,760
We could be authors speakers executives members of the media and celebrities but they can be really

24
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,400
anyone who just has a large following.

25
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:29,370
Some niggas don't have influencers with millions of followers sometimes an influence there only has

26
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:32,800
5000 Twitter followers or 10000 or something like that.

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,310
So it could really be anyone take this all in the context when you're looking at your industry but in

28
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:40,640
general they have similar behavior patterns.

29
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:43,140
They're usually very active online.

30
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:46,290
Usually people know their name.

31
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:50,670
And usually people care somewhat about what their opinion is.

32
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:55,260
Now towards the larger end of the spectrum and you get people who are really well known in the millions

33
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:59,790
of followers you often see them sharing promotional content for brands and that just in the form of

34
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:00,730
advertising.

35
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,550
That's how a lot of influences make money.

36
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:07,800
So I mean honestly just go to Instagram and look at half of the models that are on there posting pictures

37
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,510
with diet products or teeth whitening services.

38
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:14,760
Those people are professionally pretty and that's what they do for a living.

39
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:18,920
They just go on Instagram and say I eat this bucket of stuff and look how fit I am.

40
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:24,590
They go to Twitter and you'll find mommy bloggers who are posting hashtags sponsored tweets about skin

41
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:29,180
care and coffee and whatever new health food scam is out there.

42
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:33,680
But what if you're not necessarily within that definition of an influencer.

43
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:35,780
Well that's perfectly fine.

44
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:39,350
You can find one or more to help you share your stuff.

45
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,130
Influencers have to cure eight and 10 to their audience.

46
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:46,710
And honestly it's very hard for one person to do that constantly.

47
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,000
So they're looking for stuff to share all the time.

48
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:53,330
So you just need to get in contact with them and let me tell you how my friend.

49
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:57,230
Now the first step in an influencer outreach campaign yes that's a buzz word.

50
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,110
You'll hear it later.

51
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:59,410
Now you can use it.

52
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,980
Reaching out to people with followers.

53
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:02,010
That's all that means.

54
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:07,480
The first step is merely identifying the influencers in any industry who could potentially help you.

55
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,340
So really you're just going to platforms like Twitter Facebook and others and searching for your topic.

56
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:19,120
If you're going to search for Django it's framework web development or that are no extreme babysitting

57
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:23,270
whatever it is that you're in and see who comes up with the most followers.

58
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:27,900
If the people that show up look at all promising then you're just up to you to read their bio.

59
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,770
Look at their post and see how they interact with people.

60
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:35,900
Now you'll get a basic idea of who they are and if they're someone you might want to reach out to.

61
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,650
That's really the basics of identifying them.

62
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:38,880
They're low hanging fruit.

63
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:44,100
They're popular therefore they're easy to find to be up to you to list them out and cure rate the ones

64
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,100
you think are worth the effort.

65
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:48,220
Keep in mind also you can outsource this.

66
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,400
You can hire someone for $20 an hour.

67
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,960
Twenty five dollars an hour whatever to do this research just looking for people in your niche making

68
00:03:54,960 --> 00:04:00,030
a list and then just using some basic criteria to kind of drill down on that list.

69
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:06,180
There's something else you could do is use a tool similar like a more dot coms fall or walk.

70
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:11,380
And then what you can do is search for Twitter BIOS that are related to your topic.

71
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:15,330
For instance you could search for Photoshop expert or craft beer.

72
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:15,920
AUSTIN.

73
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:23,310
In fact let's do that real quick so let's go to follow along and we'll do a search of the BIOS for that

74
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:26,010
second one craft beer Austin you guys can't find the site.

75
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:28,670
You can probably see that you are at the top if not.

76
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,130
Oh my god Google it.

77
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:34,250
Now the first bunch of Biles that appear here all have tens of thousands of followers.

78
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:36,480
And you can clearly see some relevance.

79
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:38,180
They're all in Austin.

80
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,050
And craft beer is in their bio.

81
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:45,090
What's also cool here is you can look at the column on the right and see what they call social authority

82
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:49,910
which is followers of Wongs measurement of that Twitter accounts influence.

83
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,790
It's kind of similar to like a Klout score if you guys remember that company.

84
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:57,940
K L O T basically what they look at is how many followers do you have.

85
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:03,380
How much engagement you have now when you post something or other kind of a ripple effects that move

86
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:07,580
through the market some people lots of influencers but don't have a lot of engagement because no one

87
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:08,440
really cares.

88
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:13,550
And then a lot of people have smaller ones that have a very engaged following it kind of tries to take

89
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:14,290
that into account.

90
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:20,150
Really any of these top five could be good leads for any influencer outreach campaign that I wanted

91
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:20,690
to run.

92
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:25,940
So now you might think OK if I can find some influencers I'll just reach out to them as soon as my post

93
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:26,780
goes up.

94
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:27,740
Await the results.

95
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:33,380
And yes net some fancy profit well pump your brakes young one because before you actually do any kind

96
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:39,420
of asking you need to actually connect with an influencer and show you're not in this just for the shares.

97
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:44,090
It's kind of similar to our PR Saxa and remember where it's about building the relationships so you

98
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:45,740
can use it later.

99
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:51,200
Somewhat like a CIA operative who likes to build their assets and then later convince them that you

100
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,250
know you're going to assassinate the prime minister.

101
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:58,460
So you need to convince them that you're not just in this for shares and for self promotion and really

102
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:04,580
you shouldn't only be in this for that anyway and especially if you want to actually grow your audience

103
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:06,070
or be effective at your promotion.

104
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:07,490
Hash tag authenticity.

105
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:12,830
So the first couple of steps for promoting your content through influencers are to first fall the influencer

106
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,710
and engage with them either.

107
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:20,910
You know you share their content or their or you comment on their stuff or you comment on their blog.

108
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,670
Just find some way of making them notice you.

109
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:27,730
Now you can link to them or mention them in your blog posts or your social media posts.

110
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:31,880
Now what you're doing with these first two steps is essentially establishing a kind of relationship

111
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:36,950
you want to be noticed by an influencer which can be difficult but by connecting and engaging with them

112
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:39,560
in these ways it can make it happen more quickly.

113
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:45,350
For example if this influencer writes a blog post like three vital lessons learned from my craft beer

114
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:51,260
taste test you could comment and give your perspective or float an idea or ask them a question.

115
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:54,070
Remember the PR thing just just be helpful.

116
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:59,070
Maybe you can go out and do some primary research and return to them and say Hey look.

117
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:02,120
Turns out people hate this crap year that you selected.

118
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,530
In other words show that you are actually interested in them.

119
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:09,320
If they then engage with you well then that's a great foot in the door to starting this relationship.

120
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:16,250
Now connecting with an influencer makes this next step so much easier and that's the actual ask.

121
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:21,030
So Step 3 in this process is to contact the influencer and then ask for a share.

122
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:24,720
Now this is assuming of course they haven't already shared your content before.

123
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:29,090
If they have already shared it well then you should immediately thank them send them a personal email

124
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:33,830
shout out on Twitter or whatever but then keep connecting with your influencer in different ways and

125
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:36,290
be ready for the next time you want something shared.

126
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,030
The first time.

127
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:41,350
Share your stuff is going to be the hardest and then after that it's much much easier because he essentially

128
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,310
passed their sharable test.

129
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:48,290
Well they haven't yet shared your content it could be because one they didn't see it when you shared

130
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:52,930
it on social media your email or whatever online community you use or to.

131
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:54,980
They did see it and decided not to share it.

132
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:59,390
Well life is too short to wonder why they wouldn't share your wonderful content.

133
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:04,180
99 percent of the time it's because what you made is probably just not that good.

134
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:08,210
Like always keep in mind this is a process you're not going to get it out of the park the first time

135
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:12,390
you do this first piece of content you make is probably going to be ok.

136
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:15,050
Maybe the fifth or sixth isn't good enough to get shared.

137
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:18,010
Just push forward and assume that you can get them to do it.

138
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:21,760
But at the same time consider these questions that they might ask you.

139
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:28,370
They could ask you Will sharing this content get me extra engagement will make me look better or smarter.

140
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:32,440
Will this new connection with you the writer the something good in the future.

141
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:35,030
For me the influencer notice a pattern here.

142
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,720
It's all about me.

143
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:41,990
If you guys have taken my other courses go over cold email you know that the biggest cardinal sin of

144
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:45,420
a cold email is to just talk about yourself.

145
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:50,930
When people read email and when they read tweets and when they look at content to share they're always

146
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,520
going to be filtering it to their head.

147
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,330
Does this somehow benefit me.

148
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:56,680
Now you have to think of this from their perspective.

149
00:08:56,690 --> 00:09:01,040
They become an influence there because people trust them their content and their opinion on things.

150
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,480
Would your content help contribute to that.

151
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:07,700
If it's called quality work and it's relevant to them then there's no reason they shouldn't share it.

152
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:08,920
So reach out to them.

153
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,270
Now personal e-mail I think is a nice touch.

154
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,820
And if they know you already it's a big help.

155
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:19,550
Ask them politely for a share of your post on the social media of your choice and give them a link to

156
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:20,320
check it out.

157
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:25,220
Or alternatively what I personally prefer to do as opposed to saying Hi my name is this.

158
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:29,150
Please share this is to ask their opinion of it instead.

159
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:30,240
Hey I made this.

160
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:34,210
It's based off what you said before I think could be relevant to you.

161
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:35,910
What do you think.

162
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:40,370
And if it really is thoughtful and you really did connect some dots between what they care about and

163
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:44,980
what you wrote about most of the time they will gratify you by sharing it.

164
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:48,300
It's really easy to just say hey I'd love to know what you think of it though.

165
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:55,490
Understand that this message is kind of covert ask but it's a way more polite and thoughtful way of

166
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:57,000
going about this.

167
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,100
Now go to remember the end of the day.

168
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,260
These are people too.

169
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:05,710
They like noticed and included on things so don't just ask them to do to share this or promote your

170
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:08,410
work because you know you want free promotion.

171
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:12,020
That's a one way ticket to no one ever working with you.

172
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,680
Now what could you expect out of this.

173
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:19,150
A social share could be great influence or retuning your link or sharing your post on LinkedIn for example

174
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:20,370
would be great.

175
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:23,180
It's a whole new audience and you can be exposed to.

176
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:26,470
And it could lead to more followers and more engagement.

177
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:27,880
And who knows what else.

178
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:32,710
A social share was some kind of comment would also be cool instead of just a straight read tweet.

179
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:33,970
Maybe an influence or tweets.

180
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:38,590
Great insight from at your username within the link to your post.

181
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:39,850
Now that's even better.

182
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:44,150
An endorsement can speak way more volumes than just clicking or each tweet.

183
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:46,390
Now can you expect anything more than this.

184
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:46,930
No.

185
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:47,870
So don't push it.

186
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:49,950
Share of some kind is your goal here.

187
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:52,220
Anything else is pretty much gravy.

188
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:55,120
And if when you do share your stuff send them thanks.

189
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:57,780
Yeah maybe all they had to do is click a button on their end.

190
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:01,450
But it should mean a lot to you that they took the time to help you out.

191
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:06,640
Show some respect and email them personally or just reach out to them through the same platform they

192
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,170
shared on.

193
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:10,390
But after all of this is said and done Yeah you got someone to share it.

194
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:14,260
Good job well just continue to connect with your influencers.

195
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:18,970
Step one and step two are kind of never ending process that if you really want to use this as a channel

196
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:23,770
for promotion you need to constantly be looking for influencers who are the new ones who are the ones

197
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:25,000
that have dropped out our favor.

198
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:30,190
And you constantly need to keep up this process of connecting with them and building relationships.

199
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:36,460
While we are in that get your 500 section it's probably good at this point to be thinking about how

200
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:38,590
scalable this process is.

201
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:43,510
One important thing to share once that's great depends how big they are could get you your 500 customers

202
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:50,500
but you put a lot of time into developing this relationship finding them and all that jazz so probably

203
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:54,520
makes sense that you need to keep this up and think of this more as a system.

204
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:59,150
I got one share this time next time can I shoot for two 2 next time I shoot for three.

205
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:04,390
That's why it's crucial to keep reading these influencers stuff commenting and engaging especially when

206
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,830
it's not necessary.

207
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:10,420
That's the basic gist of how you can work with influencers to promote your content.

208
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:15,040
There's actually one more strategy you could consider and that's to get your content linked to from

209
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,780
blogs and other Web sites.

210
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:22,460
So get to wrap up this lecture and I'll cover all of the detail of getting back links in the next lecture.

211
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:22,960
See the.
