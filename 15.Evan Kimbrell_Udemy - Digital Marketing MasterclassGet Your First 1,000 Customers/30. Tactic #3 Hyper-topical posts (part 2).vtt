00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.230
Figures guys welcome back to the course.

2
00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:02.510
OK.

3
00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:08.580
So if you're still a bit confused about how to write hyper topical content Don't worry this lecture

4
00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.950
will cover some tips and tricks that will help you out.

5
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:11.160
All right.

6
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.570
So let's say you have a topic that you want to write about.

7
00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.780
You have to act fast to get something online.

8
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.570
So what's the best way of doing just that.

9
00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.540
Before you jump in and just start writing something.

10
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:28.170
Try to keep a couple of ideas in mind first figure out how to make that topic clearly relevant to your

11
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:28.710
audience.

12
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.970
How can you add your own value to this story that's currently developing.

13
00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.550
There needs to be a really obvious reason you're creating content about this topic.

14
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.680
So what are you contributing here.

15
00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.900
If you're not contributing anything and you're just doing news jacking like we covered last lecture

16
00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.150
then it's pretty obvious to spot.

17
00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:55.080
So try to add some new insight or new feedback try to connect some helpful tip to the event or topic.

18
00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:00.720
Really you just want to try to find some connection that adds value value that's not found in all the

19
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.120
other coverages of the topic.

20
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.520
If you can't do that well then I strongly suggest you pick a different topic.

21
00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.670
Another thing to keep in mind is just in general try to avoid controversial or purely negative topics.

22
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.700
You can certainly try this but I general suggestion is just I just don't do it.

23
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.590
There are current events happening that are again related to religion politics or I don't know terrible

24
00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:23.610
tragedies.

25
00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.370
That doesn't really mix with the content strategy.

26
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.790
You might be able to pull it off but is the risk really worth the reward.

27
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:30.970
Probably not.

28
00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:32.600
Now if you're ready to rock.

29
00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.190
Well let's try to actually write something now.

30
00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.280
Is there a perfect way to actually write a topical piece.

31
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.580
No not really.

32
00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.190
And there's a lot of different ways that you can do this.

33
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.930
Making the connection between the topic and your audience's interest or needs is obviously the key thing.

34
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.030
That's something you never really want to lose sight of.

35
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.260
But if you're looking for some ideas Well here's a couple you can consider.

36
00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.510
If the current topic is some kind of product you could say write up a full review.

37
00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.530
Here's what it is here's everything you need to know about it.

38
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:07.620
For instance when snap chat launched back in the Fall 2014 Mashable wrote this thing called the beginner's

39
00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.480
guide to snapshot as a regular blog posts.

40
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.980
They acted quickly knowing that the readers would be interested in new social media platform.

41
00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.770
They also probably figured out pretty quickly on their own.

42
00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.130
They also knew that their readers are probably going to be confused.

43
00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.570
Therefore there might be a connection.

44
00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.820
Mashable can explain it and that's that works because there are generic tech blog.

45
00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:34.770
Another idea for tackling this is that you could write what we call a recap post you write hey here's

46
00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:35.720
what happened.

47
00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:41.070
You then share some highlights about the event or topic and then you provide that unique value.

48
00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:47.430
Like we were talking about for some insight for your readers what are the big takeaways or trends that

49
00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.460
come up at said event.

50
00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:55.560
For example Austin way is a culture magazine and a blog in Austin Texas in Austin there's an event called

51
00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:01.830
South by Southwest it's pretty well known and it's gigantic and because well you know Austin way is

52
00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:02.700
hip.

53
00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.880
And that event takes place in Austin.

54
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:11.450
They did some of their own coverage of the event and then they posted a post that said here's what happened

55
00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:14.650
at South by Southwest teams of 17 so far.

56
00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:20.700
So unlike the full review where you explain what the hell South by Southwest is and here's your guide

57
00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:21.610
to understanding it.

58
00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.300
This is more or less a recap because it's an ongoing thing.

59
00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.610
Here's what's happening or has happened.

60
00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.800
So you can feel like you've actually caught up.

61
00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:34.860
Here's another idea let's say the topic that you're going after or something like I don't know a decision

62
00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:39.540
some company made or even maybe like a law that got passed that's relevant to you.

63
00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.530
In that case maybe you could write an opinion post here is what happened.

64
00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.420
Here's what it means for you and the rest of my audience.

65
00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.090
And here's why I think it's a good or bad thing.

66
00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:55.080
Any time that Google changes their algorithm for instance as you know blogs always come up with a reaction

67
00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:00.930
post saying why it's better or worse and what it means for marketers or site owners or whatever their

68
00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:02.490
constituency is.

69
00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.970
If you're curious what the new update means within just Google.

70
00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.540
Why is Google penguin so terrible in those cases the inside.

71
00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:14.970
They then add is usually that they give you some kind of advice on how to deal with the new changes

72
00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:16.020
and adapt.

73
00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:17.070
And that's pretty helpful.

74
00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.660
The last idea I'll give you is this Let's say you're writing about something that's going to happen

75
00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.990
and you want to write about whether it's going to do good or bad.

76
00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.420
In that case what you could do is read a prediction post here's this thing that's going to come out.

77
00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:32.120
And I think it will perform well or really poorly.

78
00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.890
This is a Web site you can see called Box Office Mojo.

79
00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:39.480
It's a Web site that tracks how much money movies make and any time a movie is about to come out.

80
00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.770
They write up predictions for the weekend ahead.

81
00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.050
Then after the weekend they write a recap.

82
00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:50.580
If you're in let's say the tax base you know that a certain camera or a certain device or certain Kickstarter

83
00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:55.370
is coming out well you can write a prediction post and that's a very interesting post.

84
00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:01.610
You might say the Juice Crew is going to flop miserably and well you'd be psychic now.

85
00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:04.190
Are there other ways to write topical posts.

86
00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:05.140
Yes of course.

87
00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:11.910
Before I actually mentioned right here reviews recaps opinions and predictions are just common ways

88
00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:16.780
because you know there's always going to be interest in how something new did have the latest event

89
00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:20.430
went or wanting to read people's thoughts or something that just came out.

90
00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:25.090
If there's a way for you to wrap your own blog post about something on people's mind that your audience

91
00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:26.790
would like go for it.

92
00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:32.200
Just be sure that when you do it do it quickly before people move on to something else and get distracted

93
00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:34.000
by the next shiny object.

94
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.660
And speaking of shiny objects and moving on it's probably that time that we did it as well.

95
00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:39.540
I'll see in the next lecture.
