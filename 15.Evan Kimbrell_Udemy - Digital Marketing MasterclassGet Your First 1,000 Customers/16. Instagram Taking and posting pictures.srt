1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,090
All right guys welcome back to the core.

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:06,180
So in our last lecture we set up an account and started looking for people to follow.

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:11,250
But the thing that's really going to encourage people to follow you is well what you post your pictures

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,450
and your videos.

5
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:18,300
So when you follow people you'll see a feed of recent posts show up when you launch Instagram for each

6
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:18,800
picture.

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:24,090
You could like it with you know that heart icon to show it some love double tapping the pick.

8
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:26,730
I think actually does the same thing if you just double tap it.

9
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:30,630
You can also comment or you can share the picture directly with a friend.

10
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:35,970
Now Instagram also lets you save pictures to your own collection using the little banner icon over on

11
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:37,550
the right for each picture.

12
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:43,380
You can see the first few comments and then if you click the View all comments link you'll see all of

13
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:48,630
them and have a chance to like them individually if you can post pics and videos and get any of these

14
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:51,180
reactions then you're doing it right.

15
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:56,070
So what should you take pictures and videos of much like Snapchat.

16
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:02,100
You want to post pictures and videos that help people understand you and what your brand is all about

17
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:03,780
based on what they see.

18
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:07,680
People make assumptions about you such as your overall personality.

19
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,900
Are you professional and conservative or are you fun and casual or are you stylish or are you helpful

20
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,480
maybe you're funny inspiring.

21
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:21,690
Matter of fact foul mouth or you know some mix of all of that whatever you are as a business as a brand

22
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:24,570
your Instagram posts are generally going to have to reflect that.

23
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:30,990
Now I ask these questions back in the Snapchat lectures and it's what would my followers our customers

24
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:33,330
like to see from my brand.

25
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:39,570
What can I show them that would excite them and them or amuse them or just help them learn.

26
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:43,560
What can I show them here that I can't show them anywhere else.

27
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:48,190
Now the same questions apply here but the answers could be different because the platform is different.

28
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:53,730
There are some common topics or pictures might include product pictures you know catalog type shots

29
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:55,920
or perhaps people using your product.

30
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:00,630
Retailers like Target and Old Navy upload images from professional photo shoots and then share them

31
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:02,080
with quirky little captions.

32
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,940
Obviously be careful you can't do this for every single photo because why would someone just follow

33
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:08,300
you just to see your product shots.

34
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:11,040
It's usually something you want to fit in with other things.

35
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:14,660
Then of course you could also do product videos show how it works.

36
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:19,620
Show someone using it show people reacting to it then you can do things like location pictures your

37
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:27,180
product being used somewhere notable pictures of your store you at an event or just a really nice landscape

38
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:27,890
or something like that.

39
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:30,040
People really love nature shots and Instagram.

40
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,440
You can also do things like behind the scenes pictures and videos.

41
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:37,230
What's happening in between these photos you're taking sometimes a behind the scenes pick is actually

42
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:40,740
more interesting than the posed and well manicured one.

43
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:46,090
Some teenagers are trying to take an artistic shot but it was their behind the scenes picture.

44
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:49,560
They got tons of likes because well how crazy it actually looks.

45
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:55,140
You girls use these stories feature and you use that feature to snap pictures and videos and then add

46
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:57,750
them to a daily collection people can watch.

47
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:05,130
Anyone who follows you will then see that you have a story up immediately at the top of their Instagram.

48
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:10,080
And that's one way of getting in front of them because not a lot of people use that feature especially

49
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:10,730
right now.

50
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:14,730
Now it makes sense for your brand and your kind of personality you could also consider a couple other

51
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:18,520
things you could consider try inspirational quotes or pictures.

52
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,970
When I do this for Instagram that's probably what I'm going to do since a lot of my people buy my courses

53
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,500
they're interested in starting businesses.

54
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,570
So it's probably to be something around that.

55
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:28,590
Well it's a good one.

56
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:32,000
The good quote is an Instagram account and only post inspirational quotes.

57
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,360
And while Here you go it's got 12 million followers.

58
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:39,710
I mean if that's not an inspiration right there to post some quotes of your own I don't know what is.

59
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:40,980
Do you want to do your own clothes.

60
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:45,930
Well a great app to try this is a thing called insta quote actually a free version where you just make

61
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:51,720
pictures with your own quotes pics and plenty of other options really just kind of systematized is the

62
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,720
process you know supposed random stuff that you came across.

63
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,040
That's fun or weird but obviously things are still of interest to your audience.

64
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,180
You can share posts from followers using an app like repost for Instagram.

65
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:06,880
Now this is a cool way to share a post from someone and give them credit.

66
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:11,880
This kind of move shows you value your followers and your fans and enough to give them credit for a

67
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,420
great picture as well.

68
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:19,650
When people post about the courses they take to me I usually repost them now giving other people credit

69
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:20,660
for their pictures.

70
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:23,870
Generally just good karma usually comes around back at you.

71
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:25,440
Obviously don't overdo this.

72
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,250
No one wants to watch.

73
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:28,470
Look at account that only reposts.

74
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:32,670
Now while you're at it share posts from bigger more popular accounts that you follow.

75
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:36,990
What are some of the Instagram accounts that inspire you share a great post from them and mentioned

76
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:38,190
them in the description.

77
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:40,810
You might be able to get some engagement from them.

78
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:46,380
And it's also a great way of kind of whittling down to posts you know will work well because of those

79
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:52,140
big counts posted them then re sharing them will probably also do well the bigger crowds usually have

80
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:55,460
teams of people that decide and test before they actually post.

81
00:04:55,470 --> 00:05:01,160
So in the end engagement should be a goal each time getting likes comments and new followers from the

82
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,460
content you post helps grow your audience.

83
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:09,020
Every time someone interacts with your post Instagram's algorithm picks that up and then displays it

84
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:16,430
to more people more likes more repost more comments generally to them means a better post therefore

85
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:18,390
it's probably worth showing that to more people.

86
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:22,100
Now if you want to get the most out of your pictures there's a few things you can consider to optimize

87
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,110
them for Instagram specifically.

88
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:29,000
First of all a lot of brands post a well-designed nicely produced visuals instead.

89
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,020
Like I mentioned before Old Navy does this.

90
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:35,660
There's a picture of two little kids and their Old Navy summer clothes somewhere that has something

91
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:40,970
like 5000 likes so high quality visuals are appreciated on Instagram.

92
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:45,570
They look great in the app so consider how you can create the best looking pictures you can.

93
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:49,010
Your camera is obviously certainly an option especially you guys.

94
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:53,480
We're really going to get into video marketing as we talk about later but you can also just use your

95
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,660
own iPhone camera.

96
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:59,660
It's the easiest and most convenient way to do it and a lot of smart phones are capable of taking great

97
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:06,160
shot especially things like the Samsung Galaxies and the new iPhone which has a pretty over-the-top

98
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:10,400
camera but of course you could upload any picture you want to Instagram so long as it goes through your

99
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,520
phone first.

100
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:15,230
It's really not that difficult to share a picture to your phone anyway these days.

101
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:17,960
I personally use air drops his iPhone.

102
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:19,910
Also just use things like Dropbox.

103
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:22,280
That's usually pretty easy because they don't have a camera.

104
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,170
You're not really confident your skills.

105
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:26,310
Do you have any friends with the camera.

106
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:29,870
If you can find a photographer it's usually pretty easy.

107
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:34,700
You can even post on Craigslist and find someone who will give you a day rate to go take photos of things

108
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:38,270
that'll give you enough photos to work for months with visuals in mind.

109
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:40,970
Think about establishing a color theme for your post as well.

110
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:44,950
When you check out an Instagram profile you'll see a long visual list of previous pictures.

111
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:49,670
They have a color theme or style you consistently use or your pictures will look good together and then

112
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:52,010
make your profile that much more attractive.

113
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,720
For example look at Best Buy.

114
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:58,700
Well they posed a lot of product photos but the primary colors in most of them are blue and yellow which

115
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:04,750
are their logo colors as well eyeglass maker mirrored Warby Parker very hip very cool user.

116
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:10,640
There was a lot of bright colors some with their products in them but not all to be aware that Instagram

117
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:14,430
pics look best when they have a perfectly square sized ratio.

118
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:19,790
600 by 600 pixels twelve hundred by twelve hundred pixels whatever the size make it squares it shows

119
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:23,480
up perfectly in the Instagram feed and on profile pages.

120
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:28,420
That's my ratio is not a requirement but the fit is just better if you can do it that way.

121
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:33,020
If it doesn't fit then it gets crafted distorts your image and it just makes it look crappy.

122
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,800
My favorite way of doing this.

123
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:38,150
Making sure that my things are square is Canada.

124
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:39,500
Canada's a free tool.

125
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:43,910
You can literally select the template for Instagram post and it'll give you the options like small one

126
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:48,690
big one copy paste your image and then just kind of resize it using their tool.

127
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:52,880
You can also use Photoshop but not everybody knows that his photoshop so you can either their craft

128
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:56,830
and canvas Photoshop or you can also just do it in an Instagram.

129
00:07:56,870 --> 00:08:00,930
So if you have a weirdly shaped shot then put it an Instagram and cropped on your phone.

130
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,660
Just let me keep in mind it's like a little bit harder to do it on your phone and you don't have a great

131
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:08,150
preview of what it's going to look like afterwards.

132
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:10,580
You just have a lot more control with some of these web apps.

133
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:14,140
Lindsey Graham also has its own filters that add color ization effects.

134
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:18,210
Now you could pick any one of them to apply to your picture or you can actually pick none of them.

135
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:22,040
Hashtag natural or I'm sorry it's hashtag no filter.

136
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:26,600
But if you do opt for Instagram filter while data tells us that some of them are more likeable than

137
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:27,350
others.

138
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:34,340
Overall people like pictures with what's called the Clarendon filter more than any other with gingham

139
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:36,680
and Juno coming in second and third.

140
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:40,760
But of course that's just in general on average actually depends on the industry you're in.

141
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:47,150
So for pictures tagged with fashion Kelvin is actually the most liked filter followed by Valencia and

142
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:48,050
Nashville.

143
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:51,970
What's also interesting is that pictures with no filter also perform well.

144
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:56,840
A lot of people who use Instagram a lot can just tell there's a filter and they generally support no

145
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,040
filters more often.

146
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:02,570
Plenty of people do all of their editing outside of Instagram and then post a polished picture with

147
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:03,810
no additional edits.

148
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:10,220
In the end a filter should make a picture look more interesting or more vibrant so try some out for

149
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:12,710
your own photos and then just generally see what works.

150
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:17,660
If his advice is just look at trends look what other people are doing when it's crime first came out

151
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:23,120
for the first three or four years people were pretty crazy about filters they would use filters to make

152
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:30,580
everything look better now it seems like the trend is moving towards less using filters less often.

153
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:34,750
In fact it's there's some accounts out there that don't use filters at all.

154
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:38,930
Just make sure that you're following the trends you don't want to be that company that comes off as

155
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:44,570
corporate and on like attached or you just don't understand your customers by doing the opposite of

156
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:45,730
what's cool right now.

157
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:49,760
And of course if you're looking for something different and fun you can also create a looping animated

158
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,620
picture by using Instagram's related app.

159
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:57,650
It's called Boomerang or probably any number of apps out there that do the same thing.

160
00:09:57,650 --> 00:10:04,400
My favorite is cinema Graham cinema graph and what it allows you to do is take a video of something

161
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:10,430
and then freeze part of it while the rest of it moves so you can take a picture of a river or something

162
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:11,050
like that.

163
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:14,490
Freeze everything around it but make the river move in the photo.

164
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:15,320
I like that stuff.

165
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,000
I think it's cool.

166
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:19,230
Or of course you could create an image made up of multiple pictures.

167
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:24,950
Now there's a tool called dip tick a DIY P T I see that's an app that's been around forever but it helps

168
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:29,090
you actually do that or you go the multi photo route and do something like what.

169
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:32,600
Let's look at Caine's furniture did creating a picture out of pictures.

170
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,900
Now it's visible when you look at their feed from a glance.

171
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:40,850
See if you've got some ideas cooking in that brain of yours great while you're preparing visuals and

172
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:45,710
more ideas think about some of these best practices as you start to put together an Instagram strategy

173
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:46,260
of your own.

174
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:47,800
If you want to build a following.

175
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:50,250
Posting once a day is going to be essential.

176
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:53,950
The top brands on Instagram post daily and it helps to build your following.

177
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:59,120
If you can post consistently Instagram also notices they've got their own algorithm that looks for activity

178
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:05,000
from you and likes and comments and etc. They like people who have more activity but it doesn't mean

179
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,200
you are to be stuck on your phone.

180
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:13,160
Pretty much all day you can actually use tools like buffer I think as on called like Insta post to schedule

181
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:18,670
your posts so you could just make 30 of them and once a day you're done for the month.

182
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:23,020
Now the more popular your content is the more Instagram is going to feature you and your followers feed.

183
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:25,010
So it's actually worth investing in.

184
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:29,540
There's a paid scheduling app called gadget Graham.

185
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:36,250
It's very similar to what I was just talking about buffers free unless I think if you add multiple accounts.

186
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,820
Now since this is gonna be a business account you need a goal obviously in mind.

187
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:43,950
So every picture or comment should have some form of a call to action.

188
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:47,260
Now you don't want people just liking you for your photography skills.

189
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:50,440
What exactly do you want them to do after they like the photo.

190
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:52,810
Do you want them to double tap to like the photo.

191
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:55,070
Do you want to get likes and obviously who doesn't.

192
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:59,630
Research has shown if you ask people in your description to like if you agree or double tap.

193
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:05,420
If you love this picture can increase likes and engagement by something like two hundred and fifty percent

194
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:07,230
now of course the opposite is if you just say.

195
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:13,610
Like this photo or please comment below and you don't give any context or any reason for it actually

196
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:14,600
has the opposite effect.

197
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:20,840
Now if you what follows are shares well you can also just say follow for more of this or follow if you

198
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,210
agree or something like that.

199
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:26,310
There's also plenty of apps out there that will let you right on top of your photo if you want.

200
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:28,450
So you could ask people to like your pick.

201
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:29,780
Click your link or whatever.

202
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:33,320
Literally in the photo and you don't have to do it in the comment of course.

203
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:38,210
Keep in mind it's a little cluttered sometimes so people generally don't want to look at a photo that

204
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:39,670
smash full of text.

205
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,320
In general the point here is don't just post a picture and then hope for things to happen.

206
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:49,520
Make sure you ask them to do something and you give them some context and some reason why then what

207
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:52,120
you do is you use your profile you are all to drive traffic.

208
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:57,180
Now one big pain about Instagram is that you cannot put a clickable link in your description or comments.

209
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:02,780
There is actually only one spot where you can add you are L and that is your profile so use it to drive

210
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:08,240
people to product pages contest entry forums and other exclusives you promote on Instagram a lot of

211
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:13,300
brands just add click the link in our profile for more info or some variation of that.

212
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:16,720
That's kind of the baseline you get more creative with it but that also works.

213
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:21,800
Nothing you do is use location tags photo maps are a fun way to view photos show your customers what

214
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,620
your production warehouse and office spaces look like.

215
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:28,820
Show your products in their natural habitat or being used by current customers.

216
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:35,330
Use G.P.S. data in the photos and that'll let people see your pictures aren't just coming from you sitting

217
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:40,460
at a desk and said they're out being in the world engaging with the folks.

218
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:47,900
There's some good outdoor brands that do a great job of this like RPI and Patagonia do a great job of

219
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:51,200
tagging it in some really ridiculous locations.

220
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,850
So edit your photos if necessary.

221
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:58,250
Instagram has by default pretty good editing tools use them and promote your Instagram posts on other

222
00:13:58,250 --> 00:13:58,720
channels.

223
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:03,410
Remember obviously link your Instagram account to your Facebook Twitter Tumblr whatever it is that you're

224
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:03,980
using.

225
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:08,750
Sure there's some overlap but you never know where and when your followers will read tweet share or

226
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:09,980
repost your content.

227
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:11,660
So don't take any chances.

228
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,560
It's literally just an extra click sometimes.

229
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:17,990
I know there's one more piece of advice for improving your post on Instagram and then using hashtags.

230
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:22,940
In fact there's a lot I can go over so we actually prolly get a break here and cover that topic and

231
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:24,080
our next lecture.

232
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:24,920
All right guys I'll see you then.
