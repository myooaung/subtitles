00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,460
Hey guys welcome back to the chorus.

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:08,240
Now in the last couple years we've been covering the bare basics of this thing called Content Marketing.

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:14,760
In this lecture and in the next few lectures we're going to go over a piece of the strategy that I and

4
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:18,650
many other content gurus would consider essential.

5
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:25,650
This oh so essential piece of the strategy pie is known as understanding your audience.

6
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:33,660
Now it might seem obvious at first but you'd really be surprised how little you or common bloggers and

7
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:41,730
content marketers out there know about their audience and just how often people go right into publishing

8
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:49,260
content putting a lot of work into it without doing the basic diligence upfront so that being said ask

9
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:52,310
yourself what people or businesses out there.

10
00:00:52,350 --> 00:01:00,270
Should you be creating your content for who will appreciate your content connect with it and be compelled

11
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:02,250
by it to take action.

12
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:07,740
Another way to ask this is who would be your ideal customer or client.

13
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:14,550
No we did a little bit of this back and like second two or three but we need to kind of expand on that

14
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:20,520
specifically for content marketing because it's a little bit different of a process you need to know

15
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:26,610
more for content marketing notifying our audience more specifically helped us think about creating content

16
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:27,820
with a purpose.

17
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,810
We can't sit back and think that anything good will automatically work for us.

18
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:33,420
Yes.

19
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,180
All of our stuff needs to be good.

20
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:41,100
But if we have an audience in mind when we create it at the beginning that's kind of the important part

21
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:47,840
our good content will actually have a chance to resonate with the right people resulting in low points

22
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:51,020
the content marketing which is to get sales at the end of the day.

23
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:55,730
So a key benefit here of defining our audience is that it will help us focus our content.

24
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:01,320
Adverts it can help us validate ideas before we even begin writing we'll choose topics that we know

25
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,970
our audience wants and avoid ones we know they probably won't care about.

26
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:12,840
That way we know whenever we create is always going to benefit our audience in at least some way.

27
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,700
That consistency is really important in your content strategy.

28
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:20,580
Let's say you have an idea for a blog post on marketing automation tools.

29
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:27,620
For example we might think Hey that sounds like something I'd like to read but the reason we define

30
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:32,260
our audiences is so that we can create something that they would like to read.

31
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:38,540
A lot of things I like to read that I had my audience and my students probably couldn't care less about.

32
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:44,520
So think about that idea you had for a marketing automation tools post could turn into something like

33
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:52,830
10 ways for higher ed to attract more students via automation but your audience might be say startups

34
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:59,910
and small businesses or you might come up on your own with a video walkthrough of a tool and post it

35
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:06,510
on YouTube but maybe your audience actually didn't spend any time on YouTube and they spend their time

36
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:12,270
and let's say LinkedIn and Facebook maybe they don't like video and they'd rather have an ebook or something

37
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:13,380
to download.

38
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:18,090
This is crucial information to have knowing your audience and writing content for them is kind of like

39
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:24,870
a tree falling in the forest saying but in this case it's like a great piece of content gets written

40
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:27,160
and posted and nobody wants to read it.

41
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,640
Is it still great.

42
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,340
And the answer is No.

43
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:31,530
No it is not.

44
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:38,580
So by defining our audience instead of a tree falling in an empty forest it'll fall or a forest full

45
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:41,540
of people we want to connect with and sell things to.

46
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:48,180
And they'll be crushed by this tree because of how good this content is because it was created just

47
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:48,720
for them.

48
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,790
They'll think you're psychic.

49
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,990
We need to cross our customers with greatness.

50
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:54,940
And that is pretty much the perfect metaphor.

51
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:56,460
Yeah I think so.

52
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:58,430
They're defining our audience helps us focus.

53
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,690
But what other benefits can we get out of it.

54
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:01,400
It also helps us.

55
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:04,390
I did a fine with our audience and speak their language.

56
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:10,710
When we start writing knowing our audience helps us think of the words we'll use the terms or abbreviations

57
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:17,430
we know they'll understand and the examples we'll pick because well we know they'll appreciate them.

58
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:22,080
And ultimately it helps us figure out what actions we want them to take.

59
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:28,380
Part of speaking their language will help us decide how to bring the values so to speak.

60
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:34,320
Like for instance when we run down all of these marketing automation tools and our marketing automation

61
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:41,730
poser's talking about before do we have to define the basic concepts or do we need to define the basic

62
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,020
like features.

63
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:47,010
Or will our audience already understand what they are.

64
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:51,360
We'll know if we were writing for beginners or more experienced people.

65
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:59,220
For small businesses or for large businesses for audiences in Africa or Australia these are details

66
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:04,670
that make a difference between the reader finding the content useful or thinking that you're talking

67
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:09,230
down to them and just ignoring it another benefit of defining your audience is that it saves you time

68
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,610
effort and money.

69
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:16,010
Imagine yourself in front of a dart board and you've got one dart in your hand or a gun on a firing

70
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:18,160
range whatever or maybe even a bazooka.

71
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:18,890
You decide.

72
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:23,630
But here's the point if you don't define your audience you're essentially putting on a blindfold before

73
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:25,140
you try to hit the target.

74
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:29,360
And when you throw that dart or fire that bazooka who knows where it will hit.

75
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:35,810
Chances are you'll miss and miss badly but these darts are really good you might say or you know the

76
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:36,610
bazooka.

77
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,380
So great it puts such time and care into making it.

78
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,750
I know it's going to be great.

79
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:45,740
Well yeah you're going to you're still going to keep missing eventually you run out of things to throw

80
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:50,600
or shoot but probably you'll also run out of patience money or Sadly both.

81
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:56,060
So take off your blindfold save yourself lots of time effort and money and lock in on the target by

82
00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:00,870
defining your audience and then blast it with a bazooka full of great content.

83
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:01,820
Sound good.

84
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:02,160
OK.

85
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:06,230
Well the next series of lectures we're going to cover how to define your audience using different types

86
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,690
and sources of data.

87
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:12,170
We'll discuss where you can find your audience wants you to find them and how you could focus those

88
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:15,610
efforts even more through the use of user personas.

89
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:15,860
Great.

90
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:19,110
Now go reload your content bazookas and I'll see you in the next lecture.
