00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:01,710
All right, guys, welcome back.
1

2
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:06,000
So we've been discussing the term PR throughout 
this section of the course, talking about what the deal
2

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,140
is with reporters and other members of the press.
3

4
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:14,310
Well, when you hear the term PR, now you might think 
of press releases, and that's really the old school
4

5
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:19,040
way of getting coverage for your company. The 
way it used to work and still somewhat does work
5

6
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:25,200
now is that you'd probably hire a press agency or a PR
firm who would work with you to write up an official
6

7
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:29,950
press release, those releases then would be written 
using strict templates, and dates, and names, and a
7

8
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:34,530
lot of boilerplate text, or blurbs of information that
would be included every time, like your company
8

9
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:37,200
mission, your product description, and other official filler.
9

10
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,700
Then the agency would send out this release through
its official channels to newspapers, magazines, any
10

11
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:47,280
other journalists who ask for it, as well as personal contacts 
they have with people they might think are interested in it.
11

12
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,020
other journalists who ask for it, as well as personal contacts 
they have with people they might think are interested in it.
12

13
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:49,460
Now, that's how it used to work
13

14
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:53,640
pretty much all the time. You have a story, you make 
a press release, you try to get someone to pick up
14

15
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,710
that press release, and you might work with an agency.
15

16
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:57,780
Nowadays, you do still see press releases.
16

17
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:05,410
However, they're usually going to be used by larger 
companies when, let's say, a new CEO comes in.
17

18
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:07,950
For instance, Udemy has a new CEO.
18

19
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:09,370
They release a press release.
19

20
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:15,270
They're not actively going after people trying to get 
this covered in the press or in outlets or in blogs,
20

21
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:16,080
They're not actively going after people trying to get 
this covered in the press or in outlets or in blogs,
21

22
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:21,300
but they do want to have the first say and provide
all the information, should anyone want to cover it.
22

23
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:25,740
Now, one reason reporters used to like press releases
is that they were basically pre-written stories.
23

24
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:30,910
Reporters could take them word for word and then
publish them as stories in their newspaper or wherever.
24

25
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:31,910
A lot of them did. It used to
25

26
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:37,440
work that you had wires and so journalists or reporters 
would listen to the wires, which would come from
26

27
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:44,370
things like, you know, the Associated Press, or like, 
Reuters, and these companies would send updates, and
27

28
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:49,590
then journalists would just comb through these press releases 
or these updates and then pick what they wanted to cover.
28

29
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:50,310
then journalists would just comb through these press releases 
or these updates and then pick what they wanted to cover.
29

30
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:54,300
Now, I'm sure you can see the problem though with 
this method of distributing information, especially with
30

31
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:59,700
the age of the internet and mobile technology that 
we now live in. Old school style press releases and
31

32
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:04,110
that method of disseminating information 
just doesn't really work as well anymore.
32

33
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:09,300
And I can think of a few reasons why. Number one, 
thanks to technology, anyone can publish content online
33

34
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:14,730
now, so the need for an agency to help spread your 
information for us isn't really needed for a lot of companies.
34

35
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:17,930
Number two is official press releases 
are traditionally really boring.
35

36
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,990
I mean, they're written to communicate facts and information.
36

37
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:24,930
If reporters copy press releases verbatim into a 
story on their site, well, they might be the first to
37

38
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:28,520
post something, but the result is lazy 
and it would be really repetitive if
38

39
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:30,990
other reporters did the same thing 
with the same information.
39

40
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:36,390
Now, today's audiences are looking for relevance in 
addition to the facts, and audiences want reporters
40

41
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:37,680
to give it to them.
41

42
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:40,920
The third reason is that traditional press 
releases are written from one point of view.
42

43
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,750
Again, they just communicate facts,
43

44
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:46,680
but reporters have their own opinion,
style, and angles they prefer.
44

45
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:51,570
Remember, we talked about those in the last couple
of lectures, well, press releases might offer some basic
45

46
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:55,920
information, but reporters will have their own questions 
about what things mean for their readers, why it
46

47
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,200
matters, and so on.
47

48
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:03,970
And the last reason I would say is because press 
releases are kind of, it kind of reminds me of like, inbound
48

49
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:05,520
versus outbound marketing.
49

50
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:10,950
Press releases are an outbound effort, where you 
make a press release and you just throw it out there
50

51
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:12,760
and hope someone picks it up.
51

52
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:18,230
Well, unfortunately, there's too many people trying
to write about too many things to be that passive.
52

53
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:24,750
Nowadays, you have to actually go after people, pitch 
them specifically, and make sure that they say yes or no.
53

54
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:25,280
Nowadays, you have to actually go after people, pitch 
them specifically, and make sure that they say yes or no.
54

55
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:30,300
I wish it was the case that you could just write a press release, what you wanted everyone to say about you, publish it somewhere,
55

56
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:33,740
and then sit back and just watch the press 
roll in, but it doesn't work that way anymore.
56

57
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:36,960
So press releases are no longer the way 
to get information out to the press.
57

58
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,210
How do we do it now?
58

59
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:42,600
Well, today, the process of getting coverage is
about getting to know the people with audiences,
59

60
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:49,080
people like reporters, bloggers, and more, and then 
pitching those people individually your ideas. In 99%
60

61
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:54,450
of the cases, you'd do it through email, you literally 
will email them, try to get their attention,
61

62
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,610
try to get them to agree that this is an interesting idea.
62

63
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:01,770
Oftentimes you'll pitch them a headline, oftentimes
you'll just write an article and send it to them in hope
63

64
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:06,540
they say "I like it." Now, rather than allow some 
agency to write material and send it out as needed,
64

65
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:10,410
you prepare the information yourself with 
specific members of the media in mind.
65

66
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:14,850
Now, instead of waiting for people to pick up on what
you provided through a press release, you actively
66

67
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:19,050
target and approach reporters with something relevant
to them and their audience. As we talked about,
67

68
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:22,360
reporters need all the help they 
can get finding good story ideas,
68

69
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:27,850
so pitching them your idea is a way to help them 
and help yourself. But pitching is not a secret tactic.
69

70
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:32,580
You can pretty much assume everyone out there like 
yourself with an app to promote or a product to sell
70

71
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:37,170
is thinking and doing the same thing, they're looking for 
reporters and writers and people with an audience
71

72
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:39,610
and trying to get those people to write about them.
72

73
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:44,580
Some reporters get dozens of pitches a week, while
other more high profile ones will get hundreds a day.
73

74
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:45,170
Some reporters get dozens of pitches a week, while
other more high profile ones will get hundreds a day.
74

75
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,400
So how can you break through the noise?
75

76
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:49,150
Well, this is what we're going to get 
into in the next part of this section,
76

77
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:53,240
four steps for finding, researching, 
contacting, and pitching reporters.
77

78
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:57,230
By the end of it, you'll have a decent idea for where 
to look, what to do, and how to pitch yourself.
78

79
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:02,800
It's really all about seizing on the three or four seconds 
they will afford you and your e-mail and doing
79

80
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,760
the best you can with it.
80

81
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,340
Sound good?
81

82
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:04,900
OK.
82

83
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:05,870
See you in the next lecture.
