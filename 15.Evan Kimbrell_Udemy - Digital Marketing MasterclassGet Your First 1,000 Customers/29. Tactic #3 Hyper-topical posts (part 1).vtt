00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.460
Hey guys will come back to the chorus.

2
00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.050
All right so the last couple of lectures we went over long form content and controversial postings.

3
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:12.950
Now of course if you combine those two to create a long form and controversial post well well-done you're

4
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:13.360
awesome.

5
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.880
Now this time and in this lecture we're going to discuss another kind of content that's pretty easy

6
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.350
to do right out of the gate.

7
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.720
And I call it hyper topical content.

8
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.060
Now what exactly do I mean by that fuzzy sounding word.

9
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:25.900
You might ask.

10
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:26.490
Yes I know.

11
00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.250
Hyper topical content kind of sounds like an ointment you might put on a rash and well the thought that

12
00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:37.290
you're probably right and you should probably get that rash checked out for topical content is content

13
00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.740
about something that is relevant in the world right now.

14
00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.440
Like literally right this second I'm talking about content that discusses our reference's current events.

15
00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.300
Relevance is a really big factor when people decide whether or not to read something.

16
00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:54.600
Well what's more relevant than what's going on right this second now topical content usually covers

17
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.790
one of two things.

18
00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.460
And these are the two kind of ways I like to think about it.

19
00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.420
Number one usually covers your industry.

20
00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.370
Now every industry has current events and topics people are going to be talking about on a day to day

21
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.930
basis.

22
00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:09.840
This is true.

23
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.830
It might include things like new product rollouts or updates it could be things like new tools new books

24
00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.140
new events that are just happening now.

25
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.400
What's nice is that if you write about a current event or topic in your industry not only is it relevant

26
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.120
to your audience but it also qualifies as topical.

27
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.430
It's fresh and it's new.

28
00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:32.700
Now the other way of looking at topical content is that it can also just be about the world you could

29
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.420
react to literally any current event like pop culture happenings.

30
00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:42.300
You know the big season finale of that show that everyone watches or the big sports events like the

31
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:48.360
Super Bowl or even something that captures people's attention that you see post about pretty much all

32
00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.970
over the place online whatever it may be.

33
00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.460
Now you may or may not have heard this before but writing hyper topical content can also be referred

34
00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.690
to as what we call news checking.

35
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.840
Why exactly would you call it news jacking.

36
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.290
Well because it's sort of like hijacking the attention that current news is getting and then using it

37
00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.470
for your own purposes.

38
00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:09.620
I don't really know.

39
00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:15.210
I mean I personally feel like it's more like piggybacking you know writing the wave of something's popularity

40
00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:19.610
by weighing in on it or drawing some connection people might not have seen.

41
00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.730
But then again I'm not in the circle of people that make these terms.

42
00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:29.040
Ultimately the idea is to make that connection between a current topic and your company product industry

43
00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.020
or customers.

44
00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.140
That's really the name of the game runner when they're pogoing go came out in the summer of 2016.

45
00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:41.280
Oh so long ago and we were all young it arrive at the beginning of it it was like July and by the end

46
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.930
of that month pretty much everybody was talking about it.

47
00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:49.350
Even people who had until idea would have put them on was the media and the blogs were writing all kinds

48
00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.260
of articles about its success.

49
00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.860
And it didn't really take long for other non-related blogs didn't start writing topical articles as

50
00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:56.360
well.

51
00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.070
For instance Discovery Education has nothing to do with poker Mongo but they wrote a post called Poker

52
00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.790
go in the classroom and they discussed ways teachers could talk about the game and elements of it like

53
00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.190
mapping digital storytelling and data literacy.

54
00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.170
Yeah I now it's pretty much a stretch but it worked.

55
00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.690
I also saw another one.

56
00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:21.690
Forbes One called digital marketing lessons of Pokemon go and how companies might consider using augmented

57
00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.360
reality to drive traffic to their stores.

58
00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.440
Leave it to Forbes to pretty much always jump on any type of trend.

59
00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:33.450
Both of those posts I just mentioned well they kind of rode that Pokemon go wave and they were able

60
00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:38.610
to capture the attention that Pokemon go had at the moment and then connect that to their audience and

61
00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.190
the interest that their own audience has.

62
00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:46.620
What's nice about hyper topical post is that because they're topical there's actually some pretty unique

63
00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:49.480
benefits that they can bring dear's site or your blog.

64
00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.790
So let's just go over three examples of how this can actually work for you.

65
00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:59.220
Number one topical content when you have it on your site it makes you look current producing topical

66
00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:04.510
content makes it look like you're paying attention to the world and you're hip and not old.

67
00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.340
It's also a pretty good chance to show off a little bit of personality.

68
00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.930
Plenty of space in there to put in your Yagya.

69
00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.860
Number two is a Google search algorithm.

70
00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.490
You know when you search something on Google how does it decide what shows up on the page.

71
00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.770
Well one of the new factors is that they will look for content that looks more Frasch and then they'll

72
00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.200
reward that with more search juice.

73
00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:30.180
There are obviously a lot of factors that go into how Google evaluates how valuable page is but one

74
00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.330
of the new factors is freshness.

75
00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.110
And so that's something you should really take into consideration.

76
00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:35.640
Yes.

77
00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:41.010
Freshness sounds like we're talking about bread and eggs or something but really in this case freshness

78
00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:46.080
is determined by the age of the page that it's indexing the search volume of the topic you're writing

79
00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:51.300
about and the amount of traffic engagement that your content is getting the better those metrics are

80
00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:55.890
the newer the fresher Google considers it the more Google is going to like it.

81
00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:01.350
Now the third example of a benefit I can think of is that the post can be sieved as just frankly being

82
00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:06.090
more relevant than older posts now the general assumption is that the latest info has to be the most

83
00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.630
up to date and the most accurate right.

84
00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:11.630
Well it's an easy assumption to make and a lot of people do.

85
00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:17.250
So therefore if you like to mix in topical content people will look at that and they'll say hey looks

86
00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:20.730
like they have a lot of new stuff new must mean up to date.

87
00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:23.850
It must mean cutting edge sort of Sara Lee.

88
00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:25.760
True but that's what they think.

89
00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:26.750
That's how our brains work.

90
00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:31.020
Now on the flip side if you're trying to go this route and you try to write really really happening

91
00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:35.180
right now post there are obviously some disadvantages that you should be aware of.

92
00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:39.240
Number one it's almost immediately dated after you post it.

93
00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:43.500
Whatever reference you make it's possible that I could lose its relevance and it's Fowlie so it could

94
00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:49.980
seem passe or confusing if someone was reading this after you know the time it peaked.

95
00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:54.990
Do you write for instance like the hundred reasons why app development is just like the Rio Olympics.

96
00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:59.550
Well you know that's cool and all but the Rio Olympics happened in the summer of 2016.

97
00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:04.950
According to Google Trends people search for that topic for approximately one month and haven't really

98
00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:06.880
cared since probably could have guessed that.

99
00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:13.200
I personally never cared because the only Olympics to me is the Olympics with people ski laid down.

100
00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:16.740
Then they shoot things and then they get up and ski again over time.

101
00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:21.810
Topical references can lose their power because there is a lot less conversation and people forget about

102
00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:26.070
all those details about all those events during that time and people are discussing it.

103
00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:31.270
Sure it's great topical content just be prepared for the traffic to drop off once people are done with

104
00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:32.600
said topic.

105
00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:36.100
The second disadvantage I see is that you need to act fast.

106
00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:40.800
You get an idea really quickly for a topical person need to put it together pretty quickly and pretty

107
00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:41.850
immediately.

108
00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:45.820
That generally means that you need to kind of have your process down.

109
00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:46.740
So here's an example.

110
00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:52.800
A lot of major videogame releases for I don't know the PlayStation or the Xbox suffer server overload

111
00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:57.120
problems right when they launch because everybody likes to jump on their platform because they want

112
00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:58.300
to play the newest game.

113
00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:03.630
So people complain for a day or two while it's happening and then things kind of just settle off.

114
00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:09.240
Well you're pairing a blog post about the server outages and you somehow connect this to your plumbing

115
00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:14.640
business or whatever you're doing and it takes you a week to write it edited and then finally publish

116
00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:14.830
it.

117
00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:18.730
Well your news probably won't be relevant by the time it goes online.

118
00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:23.370
So if you're going to write a topical post well you need to be nimble and you need to be able to jump

119
00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:26.190
on something really at a moment's notice that there are disadvantage.

120
00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:30.780
I think it's kind of worth considering is that if you're going to focus on topical content strategies

121
00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:33.860
it really does require close attention to current events.

122
00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:38.460
You really have to pay more attention to your industry and the world around you whether or not that's

123
00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:42.080
something you want to do if you're the type of person that likes to ignore the world.

124
00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:44.000
Well this might be kind of difficult.

125
00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:49.590
The news and the current events and the industry kind of happenings is where we're going to get your

126
00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:54.500
material if you're waiting for someone to come and say to you you should write about this or that.

127
00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:56.520
Well it's probably going to be too late.

128
00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:59.760
So you really have to constantly monitor your space.

129
00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:03.680
So should these disadvantages scare you off from trying some topical posts out yourself.

130
00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:09.270
Well probably not topical content doesn't need to be a big part of your content strategy to me really

131
00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:14.010
this kind of content represents an opportunity more than an obligation you can pay attention to what's

132
00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:17.480
going on around you and listen to what people are talking about.

133
00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:22.380
Every so often you'll realize there's a blog post idea or some other kind of piece the readers would

134
00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:26.940
appreciate if you make every single post hyper topical at some point.

135
00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:29.530
You're not really a blog you're a news station.

136
00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:31.510
Nothing wrong with that necessarily again.

137
00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:34.590
But I don't consider it a tenable strategy.

138
00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:38.910
Now this all sounds well and good that you might be wondering what's the best way to pay attention and

139
00:08:38.910 --> 00:08:42.560
be aware of what's happening in my industry or in my world.

140
00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:46.830
So when I have the opportunity to write something like this I can actually pull it off.

141
00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:51.570
Well here are some tips that have worked for me in the past and I'm going to cover for that I can think

142
00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:56.550
of off the top my head we're one set up some e-mail subscriptions.

143
00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:58.670
You can usually subscribe to different media blogs.

144
00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:01.340
You can get industry news and updates via your e-mail.

145
00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:04.550
Just go to these places usually you enter in your e-mail address.

146
00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:09.020
They make it really easy to find this and then you can actually look at the e-mails when they come in.

147
00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:11.510
Don't obviously just delete them or send them to spam.

148
00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:15.130
You guys are in Gmail will send it direct to your promotions folder.

149
00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:17.570
So then you can go there and just scan them.

150
00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:22.710
The reason why we do email is because it comes all the one space when you divide space in your inbox

151
00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:27.240
opposed to you know you have to monitor five Web sites you have to remember every single one every single

152
00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:28.150
day.

153
00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:29.580
That's just not realistic.

154
00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:33.420
When you go through them look for articles they've written that might be something you yourself can

155
00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:34.250
write about.

156
00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:39.690
That is to say that other outlets right hyper topical content so really you just need to find the ones

157
00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:45.210
that write the way you like or have interesting angles or interesting scoops and then subscribe to them

158
00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:47.080
then all you do is just make your angle.

159
00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:48.320
They tell you what's hot.

160
00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:50.440
You don't even have to go out there to find these things.

161
00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:54.810
Just show up in your inbox you can just scan through it when you find something you like oh there you

162
00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:55.140
go.

163
00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:56.550
Just write it quickly.

164
00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:59.100
Also suggest that you set up Google alerts.

165
00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:04.290
Check it out Google Google alerts or go to Google dot com slash alerts we cover this way back in like

166
00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:05.790
the getting your hundred I think.

167
00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:07.380
But it's really easy.

168
00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:12.310
You just go to Google or com alerts and then you enter the term you want to get updates on it and every

169
00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:18.160
time you search index updates something Google will send you an e-mail and say hey something new happened

170
00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:20.630
recently with regards to this specific key word.

171
00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:25.900
So that's a great way to focus on a specific something that you know hey I know I can connect this to

172
00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:26.570
my audience.

173
00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:28.590
I just need to know when something happens.

174
00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:33.340
Now outside of jumping on a bunch of people's e-mail list another thing you can do is instead go out

175
00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:38.770
and find these industry blogs and these media sites that you like instead of just doing that e-mail

176
00:10:38.770 --> 00:10:39.040
thing.

177
00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:40.180
We were just talking about.

178
00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:42.790
Go and follow their social media pages.

179
00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:46.480
Just go to their Facebook or Twitter or just follow the updates there.

180
00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:51.820
Now I know there's no real way that you can only follow these people well in Twitter actually you can

181
00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:57.040
make a list and then put them in that list and then all you have to do is consciously go and sort by

182
00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:57.960
the list.

183
00:10:57.970 --> 00:11:02.290
But one thing you can do is to use something like an aggregator like Feedly.

184
00:11:02.290 --> 00:11:08.260
I don't know if you've ever used Feedly it's Feedly dot com but the way that it works is you just tell

185
00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:11.300
Feedly which sites and blogs you want to see the latest updates from.

186
00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:16.000
And then it just grabs all that information including the social media purse and it presents them to

187
00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:21.130
you in one unified list that way instead of visiting ten different blogs each morning for example you

188
00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:22.880
can just go to one spot instead.

189
00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:23.840
Pretty cool tool.

190
00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:24.530
It's FREE.

191
00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:28.630
Another good tip I can think of is to go and check out the community discussions on sites like Reddit

192
00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:33.160
and linked in irrelevant sublets that we established before way back when.

193
00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:39.400
Check out the latest post and then just look for ones that are heavy on activity and are possibly talking

194
00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:44.500
about something that is tied to an event then over on linked in really all you want to do is just go

195
00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:48.680
and search on the search box of the top for groups that relate to your industry.

196
00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:51.640
Then you just see what they're posting and talking about.

197
00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:55.280
They'll probably post about things that are topical right now.

198
00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:59.860
Obviously you can see the top what's been posted most recently see if it's relevant to what's happening

199
00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:00.520
right now.

200
00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:04.260
Then the last thing I would say is you can always just go and check out Google Trends.

201
00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:09.880
We've covered this one probably 100 times now so you probably don't want to hear it again but it's Google

202
00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:11.590
dot com slash trends.

203
00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:15.520
You go there and you search for your keywords it will show you some of the trends and show you what's

204
00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:18.240
happening right now what people are searching for in mass.

205
00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:23.170
And that way you can see oh people are searching for this very specific thing.

206
00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:28.210
I never thought of this it's just a question of can I write a post about this and can I connect it to

207
00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:28.930
my audience.

208
00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:33.460
All right guys let's take a break and we'll discuss more about the best ways of writing your hyper topical

209
00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:35.140
content and the next lecture.

210
00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:35.750
All right see the.
