00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,400
Hey guys welcome back to the course.

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:02,750
All right.

3
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:07,680
So last lecture I talked to you about a whole bunch of different types of videos you might be able to

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,480
create necessarily a variety you can choose from.

5
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:17,520
You can make explainer videos you can make your kids you can make product demos walk through customer

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,560
video testimonials are actually quite a bit.

7
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:24,960
Really cool things about the different types of video marketing content you can make is that each one

8
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,620
can help you reach different goals.

9
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,880
Now which goals am I talking about.

10
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:33,030
Well they're very similar to the goals we talked about in our content strategy lecture.

11
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:34,590
But here's a quick reminder.

12
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:39,060
Whatever industry your and your business is going to have many of the same goals that other businesses

13
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:39,790
do.

14
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:42,300
One of these goals is to increase your customer base.

15
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,120
You always want more customers coming in and checking you out.

16
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,390
Now that's usually achieved through what we call brand awareness.

17
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:51,380
We create content to make people aware of us.

18
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:52,860
We let people know we exist.

19
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:55,340
We explain who we are and what we do.

20
00:00:55,380 --> 00:01:00,750
Now the more awareness we have the better our chances of being noticed by the audience we're trying

21
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:01,800
to reach out there.

22
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:06,750
Our common goal is increasing customer satisfaction so your customers will stick around longer.

23
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:11,790
The recommended to friends and they'll trust you when you've got happy customers you'll get a lot of

24
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:12,900
brand engagement.

25
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:18,390
That means they'll engage with your posts and other content by liking them commenting on them and sharing

26
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:18,660
them.

27
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:24,150
The more engagement we get the better our chances are reaching more people and understanding what they

28
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:24,540
want.

29
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,780
And then of course there's the goal to make more money.

30
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:30,200
Whether that's by selling products or getting people to sign up for services.

31
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,860
So when people take those actions of buying something signing up for something or completing a task

32
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:39,480
that's important to us that's a conversion we can measure and that's another key goal for businesses

33
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,070
generating conversions.

34
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:46,140
So when we talk about content in general and why we're creating it because we want to try and work towards

35
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:51,800
those three types of goals building brand awareness increasing engagement and generating conversions.

36
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:56,970
Now you should be able to create any type of content and reach these goals and yes video can help you

37
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:58,320
accomplish that as well.

38
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,560
So let me tell you how first that we have the goals of brand awareness.

39
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,940
Now how can video help us reach those goals.

40
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:08,310
Well in order to build awareness you need to create videos that are not only interesting but that people

41
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:09,350
want to share.

42
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,420
We want to get our video in front as many eyeballs as possible.

43
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:17,070
So with a goal to build awareness we're not necessarily looking to create something long and detailed.

44
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:20,070
We want to create something short and powerful and worth sharing.

45
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:24,390
You could create 30 second ads that promote your product or even something as long as two minutes where

46
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:25,800
you show your product in action.

47
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,650
Ultimately these videos are helping you create a first impression.

48
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:32,390
So if you look professional sound good and people should be excited to share it.

49
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:36,920
To measure our effectiveness here we'll want to see as many video views and shares as possible.

50
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:37,760
The more the merrier.

51
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:42,920
So that brand awareness getting more people aware of the fact that you exist.

52
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:45,390
Now what about increasing engagement through videos.

53
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:50,580
No engagement is usually measured through the number of likes or favorites your video gets as well as

54
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:51,630
things like comments.

55
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,320
Now this is a step up from someone just watching your video.

56
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:59,140
It's an additional action they take that shows they found your video interesting in some way.

57
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:03,690
The more engagement you get the more you'll understand which of your videos are really engaging your

58
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:04,440
audience.

59
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,540
But in other words engagement is a way to measure video quality.

60
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:11,910
And if you can generate more comments in particular you increase your chances of building some kind

61
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:14,040
of community within your audience.

62
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:19,290
Videos that feature people speaking naturally in them you know Blake in a conversational type way are

63
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:24,030
pretty good at generating comments if you can create that feeling where it's like you're speaking to

64
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:27,440
the audience through the video and they feel like it's personal.

65
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:32,540
One on one experience they'll be more willing to comment when you ask questions or ask for their feedback

66
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:33,570
in the video.

67
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:37,770
Comments are always a great way to help understand how people are feeling and what they're thinking

68
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:38,210
about.

69
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:42,690
So if you want increase engagement you'll want to produce videos that are a lot less advertising and

70
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:44,720
a lot more delivery of value.

71
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:49,860
Maybe you're talking people through a process giving them a walkthrough of how something works or it

72
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:54,990
could be a video where you're discussing a concept and it leads to you asking some open ended questions

73
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:56,580
to see what your viewers think.

74
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,320
Whatever is value is going to be the key here.

75
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:03,540
All right so we talking about using video to build brand awareness and increase engagement so that leaves

76
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:08,940
us with just the last one which is how do you use video to create more conversions while video can be

77
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:12,840
great for this as well but it helps to know which types of conversions you're talking about.

78
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:17,430
Sometimes a conversion is a pretty simple one for example maybe you won't increase the subscribers on

79
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:18,540
your YouTube channel.

80
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:23,460
Well when someone watches your video on YouTube all they have to do is subscribers just press a button

81
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,050
near you that says subscribe.

82
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,090
It's like a red button.

83
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:29,250
An easy way to make this happen is just to ask nicely.

84
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:34,110
That's why if you watch YouTube it is out there you'll notice that many of them make the same call out

85
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:35,400
at the end of each video.

86
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:38,690
Hey if you like this video please subscribe and then yada yada yada.

87
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:43,560
And by the way that's why we call those buttons the call to action you're calling upon people to take

88
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:44,370
action.

89
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:44,990
Shocker.

90
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:46,800
Yes I know we covered this last section.

91
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,930
Other times other conversion you might want is a purchase or some other call to action that takes place

92
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:52,710
on your Web site.

93
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:57,570
You can still use video in this case if you want to generate sales of a product or video showing that

94
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:59,340
product makes a lot of sense.

95
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:03,530
Show how that looks how easy it is to use how fast it works.

96
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:05,050
Even if it's you might want a highlight.

97
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:10,610
You can show these in the video even if your product is a cloud based platform or an app.

98
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:15,920
You can still create screencast that show the same thing how cool it looks how easy is the use how fast

99
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,370
it is.

100
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,970
You get the idea kind of covered that last lecture with the walkthrough videos.

101
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,510
Now each of these product videos though don't leave your audience hanging.

102
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:28,870
Make sure they understand how to get your product whether you tell them which store to go to which website

103
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,980
to visit or which button to push.

104
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:35,150
If you're trying to get sign ups or something give your viewer access to whatever form they need to

105
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:35,980
complete.

106
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:41,330
Hopefully your great video explaining how awesome your service is on the same page right next to the

107
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:41,600
forum.

108
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,720
People need to complete theoretically.

109
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:48,980
Now some video services like with idea of a feature where you can add a simple email form in your video

110
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:52,800
so people can watch the video and complete the conversion right there.

111
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:57,230
Either way I keep this in mind the conversion you want your viewer to complete needs to be clear and

112
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,760
obvious and easy to get to.

113
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:03,360
So your video can communicate the benefits of taking whatever action is necessary.

114
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,590
You have a better chance of generating more conversions.

115
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,680
All right got the idea.

116
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:11,190
Different kinds of videos can definitely help you better when you have different goals in mind.

117
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:17,110
So you can consider those types of various videos we've talked about in the last lecture adds explainers

118
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:17,730
product.

119
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:23,120
When I was inside and connect them to the different types of goals we talked about in this lecture because

120
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:27,830
awareness engagement and conversions can absolutely be achieved through video content.

121
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:29,000
Okay that's all for now.

122
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,900
I'll see you next lecture.
