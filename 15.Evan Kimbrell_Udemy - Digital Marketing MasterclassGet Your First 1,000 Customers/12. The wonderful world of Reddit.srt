Hey guys, welcome back.
1

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:07,650
So, in this lecture, we're going to briefly go over
how we can take the same principles of posting and
2

3
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:12,300
direct messaging, but now apply it
to an online community called Reddit.
3

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:12,950
Now, I know, yes,
4

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:13,390
Now, I know, yes,
5

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:20,040
yes, we already did a little bit of Reddit,
but you've got to get used to this system.
6

7
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:25,530
We're going to repeatedly dip back into the same groups and the
same broader strategies as we progress through the course.
7

8
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:26,690
We're going to repeatedly dip back into the same groups and the
same broader strategies as we progress through the course.
8

9
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:30,850
And of course, as we go along, the
strategies are going to start to change.
9

10
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:36,660
They're going to be a bit longer, slightly more complicated, and
in general, will have a higher potential to get more customers.
10

11
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,220
They're going to be a bit longer, slightly more complicated, and
in general, will have a higher potential to get more customers.
11

12
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:43,440
And since we're keeping it simple and still only
looking for that first elusive first 10 customers, it
12

13
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,740
shouldn't be too difficult to get them to show up.
13

14
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:52,780
Just like your 14th birthday party, which consisted
of you, a Tivo, and some questionable tissues,
14

15
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:59,010
we're still just trying to get that first 10 to show up to
the party, and it really shouldn't be that hard, should it?
15

16
00:00:59,010 --> 00:00:59,890
we're still just trying to get that first 10 to show up to
the party, and it really shouldn't be that hard, should it?
16

17
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:00,170
Reddit, not to sound like a broken record, is one of my
favorite places on the internet, and not coincidentally,
17

18
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:05,070
Reddit, not to sound like a broken record, is one of my
favorite places on the internet, and not coincidentally,
18

19
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:10,740
it's a great place to find a wide variety of people all over the
world that are making their preferences known publicly.
19

20
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,240
it's a great place to find a wide variety of people all over the
world that are making their preferences known publicly.
20

21
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:17,090
Ho-Ho, you suckers with your publicly
indexable displays of interest.
21

22
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,670
Time for us to take advantage.
22

23
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,750
Reddit, if you haven't figured this out, is divided into
what they call subreddits, which are basically subforums
23

24
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:29,670
dedicated to one particular topic, and
they can be as broad as technology,
24

25
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:38,970
interior design, and, say, productivity, and they could be
as obscure and hilariously random as "Where is the soda?"
25

26
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:45,090
which is a half a million person strong community
dedicated to finding clips of infomercials and then
26

27
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:50,040
cutting them to make them play out
of context and thus make no sense.
27

28
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:56,040
Or they can go as far as another sub called "Fish
screaming," which is a sub dedicated to high resolution
28

29
00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:03,570
images of fish with their mouths open plus text interpretations
of what the community thinks they sound like.
29

30
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:03,990
images of fish with their mouths open plus text interpretations
of what the community thinks they sound like.
30

31
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:14,190
Or, of course, the famous sub "Birds with arms," a sub
dedicated to, yes, people who like to Photoshop pictures
31

32
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:17,020
of birds and then put arms on them.
32

33
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:22,950
Reddit is a great example of everything that is right and
simultaneously everything that is wrong with freedom of speech.
33

34
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:23,580
Reddit is a great example of everything that is right and
simultaneously everything that is wrong with freedom of speech.
34

35
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:29,910
So if you remember from the previous lectures, what tools
do we have in our toolbox? What do we load our spam
35

36
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:34,660
projectile gun with, if not 100% grade A Hawaiian spam?
36

37
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,350
True story.
37

38
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:38,040
No one actually knows how to spell Hawaiian.
38

39
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,530
Well, we have tool number one,
39

40
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:44,860
the direct message, which is as potent and as
effective as cornering someone in an elevator
40

41
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:50,580
until they buy your Herbalife lotion, and then we have
tool number two, which are the community conversation
41

42
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:57,480
tricks, which aren't really tricks so much as ways to
tweak regular behavior to drive traffic to your site.
42

43
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:57,990
tricks, which aren't really tricks so much as ways to
tweak regular behavior to drive traffic to your site.
43

44
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:01,520
So, in this case, in the land of
Reddit, can we direct message?
44

45
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,760
Oh yes, yes we can.
45

46
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,410
You can actually direct message anyone.
46

47
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:08,280
So first off, just go through some
of the subreddits, and if you forgot,
47

48
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:14,260
just remember to use the embedded search up at the
top right corner and it'll give you subreddit suggestions.
48

49
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:17,010
Or you can just Google in Google
49

50
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:23,580
"popular reddits" or "subreddits" + some
keyword that has to do with your industry.
50

51
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,960
After you do some trolling, just make a
shortlist of the people you want to message.
51

52
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:30,420
In this case, there's really no real
number that we're trying to shoot for.
52

53
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,650
You know, if they're relevant,
53

54
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:37,380
they've been talking about things that are relevant, and
you don't feel like a complete idiot reaching out to them,
54

55
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:38,230
they've been talking about things that are relevant, and
you don't feel like a complete idiot reaching out to them,
55

56
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:40,390
well, then throw them onto your list.
56

57
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:47,270
You're probably, if I had to guess, across all the student
use cases are actual physical products, online SAAS
57

58
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,010
tools, whatever else you guys are doing,
58

59
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:54,840
you'll probably get open rates or reply 
rates similar to cold email campaigns.
59

60
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,840
You might get a response 40% of the time.
60

61
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:03,210
Now, on Reddit, the best thing you can do if you want
to message someone is to first force an engagement
61

62
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:08,670
with them. Click their profile, and after you click their
profile, you can see where they've been posting.
62

63
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:11,750
Click through on one of those posts and then just respond.
63

64
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,390
You can do this to one or two or three.
64

65
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:15,450
Doesn't really matter.
65

66
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:22,290
The point is though that you want to get them to then
respond to you responding to their comment, and
66

67
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:24,920
then hopefully to start a dialogue. At that point,
67

68
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:31,830
now that they know who you are, they've at least seen your
username, then you can actually direct message them,
68

69
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:36,840
and if you do it that way, with a precursor, that will
dramatically increase the rate at which you get
69

70
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:40,830
responses, and it'll lower the chance they just yell at you.
70

71
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:46,770
It'll look like a continuation of a conversation, which is the
needed magic pixie dust of cold messaging, called context.
71

72
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:48,150
It'll look like a continuation of a conversation, which is the
needed magic pixie dust of cold messaging, called context.
72

73
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:52,910
Now, as far as the second strategy of
community posting goes, it'll be very similar.
73

74
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:57,840
Try to stake out some of the threads where people are asking
for help on something - they're honestly everywhere.
74

75
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,430
Try to stake out some of the threads where people are asking
for help on something - they're honestly everywhere.
75

76
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:01,790
Once you find a thread where someone is asking for help,
76

77
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:04,350
then just try to respond, and guess what?
77

78
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:10,950
Try to be as helpful as you can, while correctly inserting
your link without making it look too obvious.
78

79
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:11,370
In Reddit, there are no footers to abuse,
79

80
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:13,570
In Reddit, there are no footers to abuse,
80

81
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:21,260
so make sure you are careful, and just try to very
seamlessly put it in there without raising suspicion.
81

82
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:25,970
With Reddit, people seem to be a little
more sensitive to the use of links,
82

83
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,760
so just make sure that you're not going over the top.
83

84
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:36,180
If you want to be really careful, try posting around a couple times
first with no actual active strategy for promoting your link.
84

85
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,930
If you want to be really careful, try posting around a couple times
first with no actual active strategy for promoting your link.
85

86
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:43,230
That way, if you post a couple of times, when people
click through to your profile, which they will do,
86

87
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,590
they don't just see a wall of self-promotion,
87

88
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,350
you actually look like a normal user.
88

89
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:52,610
All right, guys, so try to take those two
techniques and apply them to Reddit.
89

90
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:57,890
Reddit is a little bit different, but we just covered
how it's different and how to change your strategy.
90

91
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:58,200
All right. Good luck.
91

92
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:58,630
All right. Good luck.
