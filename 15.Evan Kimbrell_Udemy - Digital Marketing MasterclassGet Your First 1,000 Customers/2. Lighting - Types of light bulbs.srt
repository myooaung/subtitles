00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,040
Hey guys welcome back.

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:06,930
All right so we've finally gotten to the partner Video Marketing section are talking about production.

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,860
Getting it done as I mentioned in the last lecture video production comes down to three important elements

4
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:18,570
that mother's accessories and other things you can add on but in order to make something work you have

5
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:24,900
to have something for each of these three of lightning video and audio oftentimes with video and audio

6
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:26,200
for a do as a Wii.

7
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:30,540
And this is actually I'm going to talk about what I believe is probably the most important one of those

8
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:32,430
three production elements lighting.

9
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:36,720
Now when you watch movies or TV shows you'll see that lighting is used to create moods and artistic

10
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:37,700
type shots.

11
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:42,960
There might be different colors shadows and all kinds of elaborate design that's created using lights

12
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:48,510
and first cinematic videos you want dramatic lighting that creates moods and adds to the general atmosphere

13
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:49,340
of the scene.

14
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:50,010
That's great.

15
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:57,930
And lucky for us people in the movies Hogar they have to make really complex lighting setups to reflect

16
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:01,990
every single mood or feeling the audience is supposed to be feeling.

17
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:07,680
But for us the simpleton marketer we really do not have to go into that much depth when it comes to

18
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,830
video marketing.

19
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:14,160
Nine times out of 10 you want to do lighting to do really just do two important things.

20
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,610
First you want to illuminate the subject of the video.

21
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:22,730
Oftentimes this is just lingo you might hear in the talent even if you're the only one on the camera.

22
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:28,290
They call you talent which would be in this case any people speaking more objects being displayed.

23
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:33,890
The biggest goal here is to make sure that people don't have any harsh shadows on their face.

24
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:37,270
And the other important thing is to make the subjects look as good as possible.

25
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:41,790
Well that subject means any colors will be nice and bright and all details will be sharp.

26
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:48,420
Now you'll be amazed at how what a tiny difference in kind of a core component of lighting happens when

27
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:53,610
you go from cheap lights small lights to big fancy and complex lights.

28
00:01:53,610 --> 00:02:00,060
Now when I said You have sharp shadows on your face what exactly do you mean by sharp while a sharp

29
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:08,540
shadow would be something that goes from lit to dark very very quickly in a short span of space.

30
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:16,410
Typically what you want is to have more of this gray area right where the light is soft enough such

31
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:23,570
that when you see a shadow it's more of a transition over a longer period or longer space.

32
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:29,740
When you have a longer gradient like that it's called Sharp because our eyes can't actually notice like

33
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,980
hey there's a shadow right here just because we're not making movies here doesn't mean we should skimp

34
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,180
on our lighting.

35
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:39,510
We want our marketing videos and the subjects in them to look great.

36
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:42,160
So that's why things can be pretty important.

37
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:48,030
Now the best kind of lighting and pretty much anybody is ever going to video school tell you this is

38
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:52,880
natural lighting and that means from God's given the sun.

39
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:58,280
Now if we could light everything with natural daylight honestly everything would look pretty awesome.

40
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:03,080
But ironically that kind of light is one of the most difficult to use with video.

41
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:06,860
If you plan on shooting videos outside to take advantage of that natural sunlight.

42
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,240
Good luck sir.

43
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:12,150
There are too many potential problems and you're outside because you can't control anything.

44
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:18,210
Clouds when weather insects nearby traffic people in the background people just yelling things.

45
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,640
I'm in San Francisco.

46
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:21,600
It's a huge hassle to shoot outside.

47
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,620
It's also something that requires a little bit more skill.

48
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:26,020
Which is what I've found.

49
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:29,670
Usually I think I'm going to go outside and it's going to be bright and it's awesome and on to think

50
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:35,880
about anything I'm just going to shoot and really that's just a misnomer because you get used to seeing

51
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:40,020
people outside and you know keep thinking to yourself Wow this is terrible lighting on this person I'm

52
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:40,680
talking to.

53
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:45,780
But as soon as you whip out a camera you will notice that person looks like crap but that has to do

54
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:46,760
with just the sun.

55
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:48,230
It's directly above us.

56
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:53,430
It gives us a really awkward angle down like this so it might have shadows on my neck when I talk to

57
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:58,410
you when it's a different angles or I could be in the shadow or I can be turned around.

58
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:06,490
There's also a what we call the golden period which is about an hour and a half before the sun sets.

59
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:10,920
And the reason why people call it the golden period is because when the sun sets.

60
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:11,250
Right.

61
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:14,550
So like let's say we're here on earth and here is the sun.

62
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,860
This is noon.

63
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:21,950
But as the earth twists and the sun's about to go away the sun actually gets farther away from us.

64
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:25,650
And as light gets to us it goes through more of the ionosphere.

65
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:30,390
I know I'm getting a little too technical with you but what that does is it actually softens up the

66
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:30,860
light.

67
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:36,870
It actually spreads it out such that it doesn't make those sharp shadows as much.

68
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:41,130
Now unfortunately we haven't spent an hour or two an hour and half a day I guess it depends on where

69
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:49,080
you live but if you can shoot during that time that's often the easiest time to do it because you have

70
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:52,290
fewer shadows to fight anyway shooting outside.

71
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:58,650
Way too many variables so please stay inside as my suggestion were you have control over your video

72
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:02,900
environment if you organise someone who actually knows what they're doing then yeah you can go outside

73
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:09,300
but remember it's not just going to be you and a camera outside you need things like reflectors and

74
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:12,630
scrims and a bunch of things that we're not going to talk about and you don't need to know about right

75
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:13,000
now.

76
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:16,930
So instead move it inside because if you're inside you can control everything.

77
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,440
It's kind of like being in a laboratory.

78
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:22,830
Now a viewer inside you might think to yourself while I can just turn on the lights in my room or my

79
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:24,730
office and I think we're covered right.

80
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:30,630
Well not really why it's used in homes and offices are generally different from the types of lights

81
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:33,440
that you want to use to illuminate subjects and videos.

82
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:38,720
And if you're the driver that has their mind blown by really small mildly interesting things try this

83
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,720
on for size.

84
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:46,470
Look at the light bulb next to you if you're in a home or a house and ideally not like a hospital and

85
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:48,840
just look at the color of the light.

86
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,270
Now you think might think light is light what are you talking about.

87
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,160
Light has color.

88
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:56,610
But if you're in a home generally speaking it's kind of a warmer color.

89
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:57,890
It's going to look orange.

90
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:01,110
I don't know since I have students in 130 countries.

91
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,170
Do you guys have different colored light bulbs.

92
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:05,330
Take a photo and post it in the Q&amp;A.

93
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:07,060
I think that would be really interesting anyway.

94
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:12,090
Take a look at it and you might now notice that it's actually kind of yellowish orange.

95
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:18,660
Now the reason why it's yellowish orange is because companies that manufacture lights know that producing

96
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:27,060
light at a lower heat lower Kelvin scale produces this yellowish glow and then that's pleasing and relaxing

97
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:32,580
and it's supposed to be kind of homey the color temperature of a light bulb is measured in degrees Kelvin

98
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:36,600
which is what I just mentioned at the guys spaced out in science class.

99
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,640
We have Fahrenheit.

100
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,720
We have Celsius.

101
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,310
And then we have Kelvin.

102
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:44,330
Kelvin is just the absolute measurement of temperature.

103
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:48,990
Zero is called absolute zero where atoms don't even move.

104
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:50,730
And then it goes up.

105
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:53,880
Kind of I don't know actually I think it goes up infinitely.

106
00:06:53,910 --> 00:07:00,810
Anyway the point here is that the lower the color temperature on the Kelvin scale the more yellowy it

107
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:01,370
is.

108
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:04,240
Why does light make a different color to our eyes.

109
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:05,590
I don't want to get into that.

110
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:10,290
And the higher the temperature is though will be more bright white.

111
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:12,180
Now here's the range of different color temperatures.

112
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:18,300
You should really care about many soft white palms as little call that you buy for your home or shine

113
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,310
around the lake.

114
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:23,640
Twenty five hundred to thirty two hundred Kelvin scale.

115
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:27,870
Then of course you have your brighter bulbs which may be called things like bright white or cool white

116
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:36,690
and those are a shine around 3500 to 40 200 and then when you get into the 5000 to sixty five hundred

117
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:43,080
K range you have bulbs that are bright bright white and sometimes these stores actually call them natural

118
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:43,590
white.

119
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:48,630
But the term you should probably refer to them as is daylight.

120
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:53,750
Now these daylight bulbs are the types of bulbs that you might see in like a hospital.

121
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:59,250
The light looks kind of lousy because it lacks that like warm the lower temperature bulb has and it

122
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:02,180
can be really sharp on the eyes.

123
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:07,300
If you swapped out your bulbs like above your head or to actually did and one of my apartments today

124
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:14,610
light bulbs all of a sudden you'd be like wow I can see so much clarity and anyone standing in it just

125
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:15,740
looks worse.

126
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:20,670
The plus side of this is that it provides more visual clarity because it's bright white.

127
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:22,320
There's no interference.

128
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,800
That's why for instance you might have lights on the outside of your house.

129
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:28,170
They like the motion detector lights or whatever.

130
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:30,390
Those are generally going to be in daylight.

131
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:35,340
We use this when we need to see detail to the human eye in these different bowls produce light but the

132
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:40,110
colors sometimes blend into each other depending on where the lights are positioned and how many you

133
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:41,100
might have.

134
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,350
But when you see these lights through a camera.

135
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,420
Now the difference is really obvious.

136
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,780
Now let's check out these three shots of the same person.

137
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:52,280
The first one is lit with regular household lamps and a cooler temperature light bulb.

138
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,310
Looks fine.

139
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:56,840
And the next one is lit with higher temp bulbs and gives off a bright white look.

140
00:08:56,850 --> 00:09:00,170
You can see the difference nicer colors and nicer detail.

141
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:05,730
The reason why this might work is because the lights are probably in front of them as opposed to just

142
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:08,110
directly above them directly above them.

143
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:10,050
Yeah I can create really harsh shadows.

144
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:13,710
Now here's another set up where one lamp has a high temperature bulb.

145
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:17,060
Another has a regular household lamp.

146
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:18,110
Oh my God.

147
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:23,030
I want to throw up the two types of light are actually creating this really weird color effect.

148
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,130
So this kind of tells us two different things.

149
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:32,940
One don't mix the color temperature of your bulbs into where you place the bulbs and where you point

150
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,230
them makes a big difference.

151
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:41,190
If you just turn on the lights in your room coming from directly above or coming from say a lamp those

152
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:46,120
aren't really made for lighting subjects and thus the lighting is going to be quite poor.

153
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:48,450
And then the second thing is you can't mix the two.

154
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:55,500
So say you got some lights for filming and they're daylight's and you're trying to film in your living

155
00:09:55,500 --> 00:10:01,660
room needs more light and you turn on your overhead lights which are lower temperature or warm and well

156
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:03,140
that's when you get that gross look.

157
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:07,760
Now the risk of confusing you too much and I'm sorry some people ask me will.

158
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:08,200
OK.

159
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:13,860
So daylight is for filming and warm white is for your house.

160
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,980
No that is actually not entirely true.

161
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:26,860
In fact most film crews up until recently shot in that lower Kelvin temperature soft white color and

162
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:30,130
they used what are called in incandescent bulbs to do that.

163
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:33,130
The technical term used in video is tungsten.

164
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:38,250
So if you're looking at lights you might see tungsten lights and those that make an orange color.

165
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:45,070
Lower temperature then you have the option of using daylight bulbs which come out of fluorescent light

166
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:46,890
bulb tubes or Ltds.

167
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:50,240
The point here though is that you have to pick one or the other.

168
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:52,310
You're either a Capulets or a monarch.

169
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:58,970
You can't be both either shoot only with daylight's or shoot them only with incandescent tungsten lights.

170
00:10:58,990 --> 00:10:59,910
Mixing the two.

171
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,020
Bad news bears.

172
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:01,380
OK.

173
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:07,130
Now we have an idea of how color temperature works exactly what kind of lights are we looking for.

174
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:12,950
Well I could talk for hours about the intricacies of lighting but we're video marketing purposes.

175
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:16,120
Let me cover the types of bulbs that you'll want to consider.

176
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:19,340
Well the first one where the tungsten incandescent bulb.

177
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:24,300
Let's go over the pros and cons of that one because it's a warmer light more yellowish.

178
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,660
It's actually easier on the eyes.

179
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:28,470
So you're staring into a camera for a long period of time.

180
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,920
It's actually quite easier.

181
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,090
You don't fatigue as much.

182
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:36,220
Number two is that they're generally going to be cheaper for whatever reason incandescent bulbs just

183
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:38,230
in general are cheaper to work with.

184
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:43,950
Now the cons of it are pretty much that they're hotter.

185
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:48,850
Often times I'll call them hot lights because they'll really if you leave them on for too long they'll

186
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:50,730
really heat up the room you're in.

187
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:56,800
Now I know it's really counterintuitive because they run at a lower Kelvin temperature however has more

188
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,340
to do with the technology of the bulb it just emits too much heat.

189
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:06,730
Now the other bulbs are fluorescents which you often will see used in office buildings warehouses and

190
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:10,930
hospitals but for film purposes they're also used quite a bit.

191
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:14,420
The pros are really that they don't admit as much heat.

192
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:17,180
So if you're sitting in a room for a long period of time then they don't.

193
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,390
It's not going to cook you like an oven.

194
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:23,680
But then of course the con is that the bright white actually can be kind of straining on the eyes.

195
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,660
We use them too much.

196
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:29,140
Now you might ask if I use daylight or tungsten colored bulbs.

197
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:35,950
What happens when I film I have a tungsten bulb Volt the footage I make come off as orange ish or daylight

198
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:38,070
will be too bright actually.

199
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,990
Cameras have a thing called Color Correction.

200
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:46,270
And so what you're doing is just telling the camera which bulb you're using and it will automatically

201
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:52,720
adjust the temperature for us as it turns out our brains automatically do this for us whereas cameras

202
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:57,880
are almost too literal and they don't know how to translate the colors we have to tell them to.

203
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:03,790
All right so we have the tungsten incandescent bulbs hot easier to look at and pretty cheap.

204
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:07,450
Then we have the daylight bulbs a lot of variety to choose from.

205
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:14,850
Not as hot and kind of medium range price although they will kind of blind you if you have to stare

206
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:21,400
at them for too long and then the last thing I have which is still relatively new or Ltds Now Ellie

207
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:28,360
DS can come at a specific color temperature or you can buy kits that can change their color temperature

208
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:29,770
on the device itself.

209
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:34,030
That's not something that I think you'll ever really run into unless for some reason you were mixing

210
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:39,700
and matching video equipment with a buddy or something but it could be helpful in a pinch.

211
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:46,690
For instance if you were filming next to a window well the sun's temperature during the day is closest

212
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:50,080
to daylight and it's not to look anything at all like tungsten.

213
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:54,950
So if you use sheeting with tungsten being able to flip to daylight could be a lifesaver.

214
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:58,690
Now the best things about Ltds are one they're incredibly compact.

215
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:00,240
They're tiny there.

216
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:04,660
You don't waste a lot of effort in space storing them and carrying them around.

217
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:09,020
Number two is that they don't produce any heat whatsoever.

218
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,680
So you're not really going to sweat in front of them.

219
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:14,290
And number three is oftentimes they can be battery powered which is pretty cool.

220
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:17,920
The biggest thing with Ltds is portability and flexibility.

221
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,510
Now the cons are two things.

222
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:26,860
One price they can be extraordinarily expensive and even for the most basic stuff it's really getting

223
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:30,490
more expensive than your daylight's and your Tunks and bolts.

224
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:37,330
And then secondly kind of related to price is that if you want more affordable LSD's you can get them

225
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:41,820
how ever they have some issues with color temperature.

226
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:47,110
Oftentimes you can get Ltd's if they're too cheap with the bulbs don't actually match each other and

227
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:53,190
color temperature and Darkon kind of slow can kind of degrade the quality of your video.

228
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:58,470
So that being said try to avoid all cheap Ltd's because they in general look awful.

229
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:03,070
Don't buy that your hardware store chances are those are not video grade lights.

230
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,930
OK so right there you've got your common light bulb types.

231
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:12,400
We've got the incandescent also known as tungsten fluorescent which you can also call daylight.

232
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:17,510
And then Ltd's and one's understanding of color temperatures you'll know which types you might want

233
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:22,580
for your video but there's another way to measure these lights beyond color temperature that can help

234
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:24,230
you choose which one you want.

235
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:29,960
Now the other way to evaluate bulbs is called CROI or color rendering index.

236
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:35,240
Now the C-Drive of bulb measures is the ability to basically produce accurate color.

237
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:40,550
This is the term that people use constantly with Ltd's to determine how good they are.

238
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:48,080
All you need to know is that our eyes are rated from 0 to 100 in 95 percent of situations your tungsten

239
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:51,930
and efflorescence are going to have high enough CROI that you have to worry about it.

240
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:58,760
But with Ltd's highboy you can get some low ones pretty much anything over 90 is going to be good enough

241
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:02,740
and it's not going to create any issues with our camera or when you try to edit this later.

242
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:04,580
So we have color temperatures.

243
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:05,960
We have different types of bulb.

244
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:08,730
We have different price points different portability.

245
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:11,420
And then finally we have different see our eyes.
