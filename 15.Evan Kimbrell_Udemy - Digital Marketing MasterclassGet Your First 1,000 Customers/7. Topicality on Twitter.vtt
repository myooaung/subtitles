Hey guys, welcome back to the course.
1

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:07.570
In this lecture, we're going to get a little more advanced
and talk about finding things that are topical
2

3
00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:09.730
and related to your product.
3

4
00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:15.610
For those of you paying close attention, I'm sure you're
thinking, "Wait, didn't we talk about news already?"
4

5
00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.020
You are right, we did.
5

6
00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.230
And why, thank you for paying attention, fictitious viewer.
6

7
00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:27.040
You're probably the same fictitious viewer that asked
me to give them a website quote based off of the
7

8
00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:31.570
description "new social media app" - that was it.
8

9
00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:34.960
If you're still out there, the answer is a million dollars.
9

10
00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.880
Yes, we did talk about following news, trends,
and stories before, but this is a bit different.
10

11
00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:45.220
This is different because, number one, something doesn't
need to have happened right now to be useful for you.
11

12
00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:45.900
This is different because, number one, something doesn't
need to have happened right now to be useful for you.
12

13
00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.340
And two, we can use blogs.
13

14
00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:55.330
Blogs are spelled B-L-A-G-S and pronounced blags.
We can use blags instead of just what new story
14

15
00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.000
people are talking about at any given moment on Twitter.
15

16
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.300
And before you post in the Slack group that there's
no news or blog posts about your industry,
16

17
00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:09.690
every industry has some sort of news or blogs
covering it somewhere on the internet.
17

18
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:10.530
They are out there,
18

19
00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.840
you just have to do a little bit of
thinking and a little bit of digging.
19

20
00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.940
By the end of this lecture, we'll have covered some easy
ways to find topical news and relevant blogs for your space.
20

21
00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.070
By the end of this lecture, we'll have covered some easy
ways to find topical news and relevant blogs for your space.
21

22
00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.090
So the idea behind this strategy is that we're going
to go out, search and destroy-like, find some
22

23
00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.840
blags and news that are related to
our space and what we're doing,
23

24
00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:35.230
figure out who interacted with the same said blags
and news, and then use that as a way to build a list
24

25
00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:40.500
of pre-qualified users that we can then
tweet at and interact with on Twitter - like duh.
25

26
00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:46.510
If you're just mindlessly sifting through Twitter, as
about 80 million people do a day, you aren't going
26

27
00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:51.910
to be able to very effectively tell who is interested in
your space or in the problem you're trying to solve.
27

28
00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:52.890
to be able to very effectively tell who is interested in
your space or in the problem you're trying to solve.
28

29
00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.550
This is one way of flushing those users out.
29

30
00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:01.180
OK, so to better conceptualize this, let's use another
example business, so you can kind of get a better
30

31
00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:02.260
idea of how this works.
31

32
00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:03.750
Let's say your product is,
32

33
00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.370
oh, I don't know, a time management app.
33

34
00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:12.130
Maybe your app has some sort of unique approach to time
management for super busy people or something like that.
34

35
00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.500
Maybe your app has some sort of unique approach to time
management for super busy people or something like that.
35

36
00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:18.700
Let's say your productivity app is a mobile app that helps
people decide what to delegate. If the task is boring,
36

37
00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:19.620
Let's say your productivity app is a mobile app that helps
people decide what to delegate. If the task is boring,
37

38
00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:24.770
mind-numbingly repetitive and may or
may not include some sort of bodily fluid,
38

39
00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:25.940
well, that's what interns are for, and I'm sure
this app is there to remind you of that.
39

40
00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.380
well, that's what interns are for, and I'm sure
this app is there to remind you of that.
40

41
00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:34.470
Now, since you've probably spent a ton of time researching
different time management concepts while you
41

42
00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:40.030
were coming up with the product, I'm guessing you
already have a few blog posts or news articles saved
42

43
00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.730
somewhere that are on your favorites for the subject.
43

44
00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.550
Those bookmarked articles and pieces of
news are a great place to start from.
44

45
00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:49.950
Now, if you've been living in a cave
since the internet was created,
45

46
00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:53.300
you've just recently re-entered civilized society,
46

47
00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:59.770
you saw sunlight, then you saw that Donald Trump was
president, and you didn't go back into your cave, oh
47

48
00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:00.180
you saw sunlight, then you saw that Donald Trump was
president, and you didn't go back into your cave, oh
48

49
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:07.000
and you somehow immediately made a time management app for
busy people without actually doing any research on the internet,
49

50
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.080
and you somehow immediately made a time management app for
busy people without actually doing any research on the internet,
50

51
00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.890
well, first of all, welcome back,
51

52
00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.380
and second of all, wow, that is honestly impressive.
52

53
00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.540
So if you're not what I just described, then
53

54
00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.200
keep those articles you have saved somewhere.
54

55
00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.160
We'll keep them for a bit later.
55

56
00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.050
A good rule of thumb for this technique is to compile
about five articles, because some articles are going
56

57
00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:27.730
to work better than others.
57

58
00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.190
If you have five in mind already,
congratulations, you are not a caveman.
58

59
00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.840
Now, if you don't have five articles or any at all,
don't worry, because now we're going to go over two
59

60
00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:43.270
different ways to find some that will help us connect with
more early customers the way we just previously described.
60

61
00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.870
different ways to find some that will help us connect with
more early customers the way we just previously described.
61

62
00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.130
One is Google,
62

63
00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.570
I'm sure you heard of that one, but we'll use it
in a way that you might not actually know about.
63

64
00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:55.060
And the second one we're going to do is a tool called
Buzzsumo, and we are going to use both of them to
64

65
00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.730
find you some more customers on Twitter.
65

66
00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:03.360
OK, so for the first one, let's jump over to our trusty
friend Google, who has never led us astray, and
66

67
00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.860
search for something that fits your industry
or might describe your product.
67

68
00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:12.310
For this example, remember, we're working with a time
management app, so let's search for time management. Instead
68

69
00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:13.760
of just searching regularly,
69

70
00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.150
we're going to click on "News" here up at the top.
70

71
00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:21.820
That way, we won't see a lot of other stuff, because
it's articles that we're actually interested in.
71

72
00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:28.240
Now, depending on what you're searching for,
sometimes Google sticks it in the "More" section,
72

73
00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:30.030
no one knows why.
73

74
00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.540
Well, you know why, because algorithms.
74

75
00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:32.830
All right.
75

76
00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:33.840
So there we go.
76

77
00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:37.270
Now we can see some recent articles on the topic.
77

78
00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.220
Let's pick one and just check it out.
78

79
00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:45.850
Honestly though, the actual content of the post isn't
all that important as long as the title makes sense,
79

80
00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:51.730
it's related to your product, and the article is written
by what looks like a reputable source or relevant
80

81
00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:53.230
looking blog domain,
81

82
00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.730
then it should work fine for what we're going to do with it.
82

83
00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:01.590
What's most important though is whether or not
people are sharing this article we found on Twitter.
83

84
00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:07.320
Now, let's copy the URL of the selected article
and head over to search.twitter.com, which we
84

85
00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.730
used in a previous demo, and plug it in.
85

86
00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.680
You're going to probably see a lot of
companies tweeting out articles like this.
86

87
00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:20.970
Just ignore those. You want to find real, actual people
who are so into time management that they just
87

88
00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:23.330
had to share it with their followers.
88

89
00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:28.980
They're the type of people that probably use standing desks,
dual monitors, and say things like "crushing it" all the time.
89

90
00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:30.000
They're the type of people that probably use standing desks,
dual monitors, and say things like "crushing it" all the time.
90

91
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.940
Once you found a couple of those, then reply to
them like we talked about in an earlier lecture.
91

92
00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:39.160
If you don't remember how to do that
without sounding like a spammy sales guy,
92

93
00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:46.500
well, basically you just want to find something they
wrote or shared and use that as a way to say something
93

94
00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.370
legitimately related to it.
94

95
00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:54.460
Once you get them into a conversation, you can
introduce the product or continue the conversation,
95

96
00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:57.710
with the idea in mind that you will later introduce it.
96

97
00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:02.190
All right, so that is it, you use Google to find an
article to find people who shared that article,
97

98
00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:05.980
and we know, because they shared the
article, they're interested in that topic,
98

99
00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:07.820
let's start a conversation with them.
99

100
00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:11.390
Once you do that, it's very easy
to get them to look at your website,
100

101
00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:15.860
presumably, if what you're selling is
worthwhile, they could possibly buy it.
101

102
00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:22.470
All right, now onto the second tool, Buzzsumo. Now,
Buzzsumo is a paid tool and it costs like $100/month I think,
102

103
00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:23.190
All right, now onto the second tool, Buzzsumo. Now,
Buzzsumo is a paid tool and it costs like $100/month I think,
103

104
00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:29.640
but you can get limited access without paying or
even creating an account, and I'm pretty sure if you
104

105
00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:33.790
really want to go farther with this,
they have a free trial period.
105

106
00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:36.360
We're just trying to get you your
first 10 customers in this section,
106

107
00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:43.650
so there's really no need to spend roughly 52 orders
of large French fries at McDonald's on it per month.
107

108
00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:44.130
so there's really no need to spend roughly 52 orders
of large French fries at McDonald's on it per month.
108

109
00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:44.630
True story.
109

110
00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:52.320
I actually have a friend who does that McDonald's
French fries calculation to prevent them from buying
110

111
00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:56.210
things and apparently to justify eating more French fries.
111

112
00:06:56.250 --> 00:07:03.680
So we head over to Buzzsumo.com. As you can see,
there is a search bar right there on the home page.
112

113
00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:05.550
This is where we'll plug in the key word
113

114
00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:11.940
"time management" again, just like we did on Google,
and that way we can see a list of articles related
114

115
00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:13.130
to time management.
115

116
00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:18.520
Ok, so now we see a list of articles sorted
by the amount of total shares.
116

117
00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:20.480
You can also see the website they're from,
117

118
00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:27.080
and when they were published right here below the
link. We can open a couple of these up in a new tab,
118

119
00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:32.010
check them out briefly to make sure they make
sense, like we talked about a moment ago.
119

120
00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:35.870
Again, some might make sense and some might not at all.
120

121
00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:40.650
And then we can just copy the URL of the article
and do the exact same thing we did with Twitter.
121

122
00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:45.930
Remember? Search.twitter.com, find the people
that shared it, interact with those people.
122

123
00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:49.860
What's really great about Buzzsumo is that you're
not only going to find stuff that was shared more
123

124
00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:54.780
widely, but you're also going to find stuff that's still
being shared by people even though it wasn't
124

125
00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:57.130
published earlier today.
125

126
00:07:57.150 --> 00:08:01.350
So the people that are reading these and sharing
these articles were probably actually searching for
126

127
00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:03.400
something related to it, or
127

128
00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:08.310
you know, for example, time management, and it's
very possible they were looking for some sort of solution
128

129
00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:10.250
to their time management problems.
129

130
00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:15.600
They actively went out and seeked
or sooked this information out.
130

131
00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:20.190
Another great thing about Buzzsumo is we don't have
to dig around articles to figure out which ones
131

132
00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:21.330
have been shared.
132

133
00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:23.460
This is automatically sorted for us.
133

134
00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:28.200
So why exactly do we use Google
then as well in addition to this?
134

135
00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:31.500
Well, I'll give you a pretty quick answer for that one.
135

136
00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:33.710
It's free and it has better coverage.
