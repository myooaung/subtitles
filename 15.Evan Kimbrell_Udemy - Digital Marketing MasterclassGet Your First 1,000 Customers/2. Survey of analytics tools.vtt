00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:05.520
Hey guys, welcome back to the course. In this lecture, 
we're going to get acquainted with what analytics tools
1

2
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.680
there are and how to decide which one is right 
for your business. Analytics, for the uninitiated, just
2

3
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:16.180
refers to tracking and compiling the records 
of how people interact on your site.
3

4
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.460
Do they buy something?
4

5
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.780
Do they read something?
5

6
00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:20.100
Do they share it?
6

7
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.830
Do they clearly hate it and just leave?
These other things that we want to measure.
7

8
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.680
We're going to do a real quick sweep of the big three 
analytics platforms worth knowing at this point.
8

9
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:37.320
Yes, I know, there are literally hundreds of analytics 
platforms out there, but guess what, we're going
9

10
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.450
to focus on three.
10

11
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.780
The first one is Google Analytics, the second one
is Mixpanel, and the third one is Kissmetrics.
11

12
00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.850
Now, chances are, if you've had any experience with 
running a website or marketing campaign in the past,
12

13
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.580
you're probably familiar with Google Analytics. If analytics 
platforms were bread, well, then Google Analytics
13

14
00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.730
would be plain old whole wheat.
14

15
00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:56.700
It's robust, it's good for you,
15

16
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:57.750
It's robust, it's good for you,
16

17
00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.920
it signals that you're cheap, and no one
is really going to get excited about it.
17

18
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.760
It's not white bread, because white 
bread is not bread, it's actually poison.
18

19
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.280
Google Analytics is somewhat the 
bedrock of analytics platforms.
19

20
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:16.170
Estimates range that anywhere from 50% to 69% 
of all websites using tracking tools are using Google
20

21
00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.900
Analytics. Of the top 10,000 sites
on the whole of the intertubes,
21

22
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.710
65% of them use Google Analytics.
22

23
00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:28.430
So I guess we're not the only cheapskates trying 
to get away with using the only one that's free.
23

24
00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:29.800
Now, what do you need to know 
about good old Google Analytics?
24

25
00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.750
Now, what do you need to know 
about good old Google Analytics?
25

26
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.450
Well, for starters, that it's the only 
large platform that is mostly free.
26

27
00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.180
The other two we cover actually charge upfront to
use their tools, whereas good old Google Analytics is
27

28
00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.060
fine with you bumming off of it and
sleeping on its couch for a while.
28

29
00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:51.780
That is, of course, until you need to add a lot of 
collaborators, want some more advanced custom tracking,
29

30
00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:55.310
at which point they charge you $150,000 a year.
30

31
00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:01.620
Yes, some softwares go from free to $9,99 or free to $14.99,
31

32
00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:07.590
Google goes from free to $150,000 a year. 
Because of its simplified focus,
32

33
00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.060
it's something I generally suggest for entry level work.
33

34
00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:18.360
As in, if this is your first site or you only plan 
to do basic tracking, then I say stick with Google
34

35
00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:25.920
Analytics. In 90% of cases, you really won't need 
fancy customized tracking, and even if you do,
35

36
00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:32.940
well, you can often get away with tracking less at first 
and then transitioning on to something more
36

37
00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:38.480
fancy. And also, be honest, you wouldn't even know 
what to do with all of that customized data anyway.
37

38
00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.960
The second thing you need to understand about Google 
Analytics is that it actually tracks users differently
38

39
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.620
than the other two platforms.
39

40
00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:50.760
Now, the last thing I'll say about Google Analytics
is that it's by far the easiest to install of the three.
40

41
00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:51.350
Now, the last thing I'll say about Google Analytics
is that it's by far the easiest to install of the three.
41

42
00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:57.420
Now, like most standard analytics platforms, all 
you have to do to install it is you take a snippet of
42

43
00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:04.560
code and you just drop it on your site, pretty much 
anywhere in the header tag, and that is really it.
43

44
00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:10.680
If you want to track more pages, well, then you just 
put that code on more pages. Whatever you want to
44

45
00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.480
track, you stick the code on, and you're good.
45

46
00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.490
This is the style that you'll see in some 
of the simpler analytics platforms.
46

47
00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.830
OK.
47

48
00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:22.970
Now, the second analytics platform we'll chat 
about is Mixpanel. Now, Mixpanel is not free.
48

49
00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:28.710
Yes, I can hear the collective groan of all of you,
but it is more feature rich than Google Analytics,
49

50
00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:32.620
and as a result some people just
like it better, myself included.
50

51
00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.570
I personally like using Mixpanel 
better because it's easier to use,
51

52
00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.460
but I will admit it's quite a bit harder to set up.
52

53
00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.490
Now, the biggest difference between Mixpanel and 
Google Analytics is something that's probably going
53

54
00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:46.010
to bore you to tears,
54

55
00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:51.780
but hopefully if I say this in a really convincing tone
you'll somehow absorb it through the mental
55

56
00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.440
coma you're currently in,
56

57
00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:58.110
and then sometime later you'll be able to use this fact 
to impress your friends, perhaps secure a mate.
57

58
00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:04.760
Mixpanel tracks actions, whereas Google 
Analytics tracks page views. Mind blown?
58

59
00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:09.510
Yes. There is pandemonium in the 
marketing community as a result of this.
59

60
00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:11.820
Not really, but it is actually significant.
60

61
00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:16.480
When you go to a website and you 
load that page, that's called a page view.
61

62
00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:23.430
You load that page and then Google Analytics tracks 
that and says "Hey, this person loaded that page." What
62

63
00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:29.400
you do after that, Google doesn't really particularly care
about. Whether you're loading that page on accident
63

64
00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:36.390
on the way to porn pictures of puppies, or whether 
you proceeded to click every button on site and spin
64

65
00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:38.120
your mouse around for hours,
65

66
00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.210
Google, like the honey badger, don't give a shit.
66

67
00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:42.780
So that's a big advantage.
67

68
00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:49.170
Check one in the pro column for Sir Mix-a-panel, because 
what people do on your site is important beyond
68

69
00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:55.950
what they just saw. On Mixpanel we can see if 
they click this or scroll to what, or what they typed
69

70
00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:57.820
into the form before abandoning.
70

71
00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:04.500
Of course, that exact level of information comes with 
a drawback. It's way more complicated to install and
71

72
00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:11.070
you yourself are not going to probably be able to do it 
correctly, unless you are proficient at programming.
72

73
00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:14.740
You have to put JavaScript trackers that look for actions,
73

74
00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:19.890
and the more action you want to track, then the longer
it's going to take to set them all up. With Mixpanel
74

75
00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:22.550
and the last one we'll briefly discuss, Kissmetrics,
75

76
00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:28.470
these platforms are better for people that are focusing 
more on web applications and not just, say, web
76

77
00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:35.700
stores or web info products. With apps, you care about 
how long it takes people to do things on your site
77

78
00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:38.220
and how they interact on each page.
78

79
00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:43.980
These are things that you should be tracking. But with 
an e-commerce store, on the other hand, what are
79

80
00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:45.690
you really trying to track?
80

81
00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:50.630
All right, let's round this off so that you can get 
on with your life and the rest of the course.
81

82
00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:53.060
Last one worth knowing is Kissmetrics.
82

83
00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:58.890
If you haven't noticed, these three services are 
kind of on a continuum in terms of effort to install
83

84
00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:00.170
and feature ability.
84

85
00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:06.390
Google Analytics is easy and doesn't track much, Mixpanel 
is harder to use but tracks more, and Kissmetrics
85

86
00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:10.890
tracks an enormous amount and is hell on earth to set up.
86

87
00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:11.730
Just kidding,
87

88
00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:16.980
but you will have to have a developer set this one up. 
Kissmetrics works in a similar way to Mixpanel.
88

89
00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:17.550
but you will have to have a developer set this one up. 
Kissmetrics works in a similar way to Mixpanel.
89

90
00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:23.490
It tracks actions, but unlike the other two, it doesn't
just say anonymous user came to your site and
90

91
00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:25.520
did this and did that.
91

92
00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:31.130
It can actually track the anonymous user across
all of their devices and all of their visits,
92

93
00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:38.700
so you can look instead of at an aggregate of what's happening, 
at a long comprehensive story of each individual user.
93

94
00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:39.270
so you can look instead of at an aggregate of what's happening, 
at a long comprehensive story of each individual user.
94

95
00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:46.290
On top of that, you can do A/B testing that's actually 
built into the system. With the other ones, you'll actually
95

96
00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:49.270
have to use a third party tool to do it efficiently,
96

97
00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:54.300
probably something like Optimizely. If you're already 
a data junkie and you really think having the
97

98
00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:59.750
sharpest, most accurate, and most detailed 
data will benefit you beyond the other two,
98

99
00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:02.130
then it's something worth looking into.
99

100
00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:08.670
For the vast majority of you though, Google Analytics
is really fine, and if you have something that operates
100

101
00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:18.510
more like an app and you're trying to optimize user 
behavior, as well as time on page and just regular
101

102
00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:21.810
conversion and sales, well, then 
Mixpanel is probably the way to go.
102

103
00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:24.090
So speaketh me. See you in the next lecture.
