00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:06.650
OK we are back and we're talking about video production set ups once again as I described the wisdom

2
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.820
shot which is a way of setting up and shooting videos with one speaker and it's inspired by the work

3
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.480
of those guys.

4
00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.790
That's the one you see everywhere with singular colored background behind them with lamp posts towards

5
00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.970
it.

6
00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.320
They have a gradient flowing up behind the back of their head.

7
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.590
When you do it now I want to talk about an even older and more widely used video production setup.

8
00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.060
The interview now people have been shooting interviews for many years because if you can show some footage

9
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:38.430
of someone speaking to a person well it can provide an intimate personal kind of experience sort of

10
00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.650
looking straight into the camera or the speaker looks and delivers the responses to questions off camera

11
00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.000
usually looking to the person asking the questions.

12
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.500
These kinds of videos can be used as explainer videos but also are really effective when you just need

13
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.090
someone to tell a story.

14
00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.910
This is why many client testimonials and interviews for case studies are shot using this particular

15
00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:00.420
setup.

16
00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.530
So if you have some interviews to conduct for your marketing videos this is definitely something that

17
00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.330
you should check out.

18
00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:10.500
Now for our purposes let's assume we go with a classic set up where one person is interviewed on camera

19
00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.140
while the interviewer is off camera.

20
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.750
So in this way the interviewer can either ask questions or they can prompt the subject to talk about

21
00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.950
specific things that would be valuable in the video.

22
00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.220
This is not too different from the Whiskey a shot.

23
00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.750
But the first big difference is the orientation and the location of the subject instead of being in

24
00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.650
the middle of the frame the subject is usually positioned like slightly off to one side.

25
00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.010
Now check out this video by the Criterion Collection where they interview Jack Nicholson about the movie

26
00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.660
Five Easy Pieces.

27
00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.900
He's on the left side of the frame looking toward the right.

28
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.790
It's a natural looking setup that you could actually reverse depending on the result that you want it.

29
00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.300
Now you could position the subject on the right and then have them look to the left that really matter

30
00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.760
for lighting you still want to have two light sources behind the camera pointed towards the subject.

31
00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.730
However in an interview set up you might want to consider what professionals call a three point lighting

32
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.110
setup and you've heard me talk about 3.20 before I think in most situations it's kind of both.

33
00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:11.370
But for an interview this actually might be one of the scenarios where it works.

34
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:17.040
So like we see a shot you're going to use at least three lights just a little bit differently.

35
00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:23.130
So number one place a large soft light on the side that your subject is looking at now in Jack Nicholson's

36
00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.460
case.

37
00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.420
Place it on the right side.

38
00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:26.660
This is called your key light.

39
00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.710
Now second place another soft light on the other side but not as strong as the key light.

40
00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:35.540
And this is essentially used to remove any harsh shadows from the subject's face.

41
00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:40.300
This light is called the fill light so the key lights remain on the fill kind of fills in what's left.

42
00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.070
Then third and this is actually kind of optionals you can place a third light called the backlight or

43
00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:48.960
hair light above or behind the subject which essentially helps create some kind of separation between

44
00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:49.980
them the background.

45
00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.090
Now depending on what your speakers are wearing and what the background looks like you might need some

46
00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.150
light to help them stand out in this shot with Jack Nicholson.

47
00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.680
He's in front of a large bright window.

48
00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.810
So you'd be less concerned with him blending into the background and more concerned with making sure

49
00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.400
he's lit well enough from the front.

50
00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:10.050
Whatever use really is make sure they have the same color temperature so your subject has the same coloration.

51
00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:15.420
You don't want them to look natural on one side from a higher temperature or daylight bulb than yellowish

52
00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:20.730
and gross on the other side from a tungsten McAleer bulbs the color will look nice and even if you have

53
00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.890
two subjects instead of one just use the space logically and evenly spaced them on camera.

54
00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.990
Now in this interview from a censure to members of their strategy team are being interviewed with two

55
00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:36.230
people who might need stronger or more lighting to make sure they're well lit but otherwise the set

56
00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.090
up is pretty much the same thing.

57
00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:45.120
So for audio Well you could try one shock on Mike pointing at the subject or if it's two people in between

58
00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:50.920
the two and that works obviously if they don't move around a lot and that's case you're probably safe.

59
00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.760
But you could also opt for a lavalier mike but you know the option is really going to be up to you.

60
00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:00.270
I personally don't like lowlier is because you can see them and it just makes it look fake and not unnatural.

61
00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:05.030
Keep in mind you might also want to Mike the interviewer right the person asking your questions.

62
00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.800
You don't obviously want the questions to just be silent and then we just hope we understand what they're

63
00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:10.700
asking.

64
00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.480
You know or it might not be the case that you need to display the questions first.

65
00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:18.270
If it is the case that you want this will then just make sure that you have a mic for the person asking

66
00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:22.940
the questions and for video Well the simplest solution is just to use one camera to shoot your subject

67
00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.730
get everything set up hit record and that's really all you need.

68
00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:31.590
However if you wanted to do like a second camera and you get either a closer angle of your subject or

69
00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.200
an alternative angle that's perfectly fine.

70
00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:39.660
Another angle means that you have something to cut to in case you need to edit the subjects response.

71
00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:45.270
Maybe they restart a story or they flub some words or use some downtime they have to cut out who knows.

72
00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:48.000
It always seems like there's something that you have to edit.

73
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.680
So having that second backup angle to cut two can actually help quite a bit.

74
00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.520
Another camera could be also used to shoot your interview earlier.

75
00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.250
And if so well then you need to light them as well.

76
00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:05.570
You can actually do the the thing you see like news outlets and associated press do an interview say

77
00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:09.430
like the president where they essentially have the same setup twice.

78
00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:14.750
So you're looking at the first say the president talking to the interviewer slightly or not looking

79
00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:16.700
at the camera off screen and then the reverse.

80
00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:20.910
They actually have two cameras so flip between question answer or question answer.

81
00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.160
Then usually the third camera on the very back just to show the whole setup just a tip if you do decide

82
00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:30.170
to use multiple cameras they don't have to be exact obviously like brand or model but you have to make

83
00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:35.990
sure that all the settings match up sometimes lower quality cameras just won't be able to match higher

84
00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:40.470
quality and so you have a natural difference but you only learn this from trying.

85
00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:43.750
Now you have your main camera set for a certain type of exposure for example.

86
00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:47.720
Well then you have to make sure that's on the same exposure of the same equivalent exposure.

87
00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.960
What do you consider in interview is how to present the questions.

88
00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:52.490
Now you really have two options here.

89
00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:56.200
Either you put a camera on a mike on the person asking them or you don't.

90
00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:01.490
If you plan on having a lively conversation expect the interviewer to jump in with a follow up question

91
00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:06.860
or interact with the subject or I don't know laugh it makes sense to show them and of course meet them

92
00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:07.490
as well.

93
00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:12.050
But the other option is just to do that talking head interview in its name this way because your video

94
00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:16.670
will essentially be a talking head with no other angles or people in it and that's perfectly fine.

95
00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:18.490
It's a style many people use.

96
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:22.510
So the only person you want being seen and heard is your subject and you obviously don't have to make

97
00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.540
the interviewer save yourself some time and money.

98
00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:28.640
The other reason I would like your interviewer is just to hear the questions they ask and here's why.

99
00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:34.130
If you don't show or Mike The interviewer then how do they know what the question being asked what other

100
00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:38.910
people do if they're not going to like them as they'll show like title cards or were called lower thirds

101
00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:43.460
that pop in the lower third section of the video to say what the question is.

102
00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:47.060
But you know that requires editing in that same century interview video.

103
00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:49.500
They actually transition with title cards.

104
00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:52.390
So just cuts title card then cuts.

105
00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:56.410
So it shows the question then the answer it shows the next question though.

106
00:06:56.430 --> 00:07:01.610
The transition as far as background goes you could use that seamless paper background that we talked

107
00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:03.160
about in the whiskey a shot.

108
00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:08.390
Or you could use a location like an office or a conference room bowling alley if you have an office.

109
00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:10.060
That's a great place to do it whatever.

110
00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:11.630
Just keep the same fundamentals and money.

111
00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:12.940
Your subject needs to be well lit.

112
00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:16.080
They don't honestly blend into the background so focus on that.

113
00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:17.140
So it makes sense.

114
00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:19.640
Anything I didn't mention is really up to you.

115
00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:24.830
And it does take some trial and error to get this one right but we have covered all the major parts

116
00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:25.590
of it.

117
00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:30.620
Try it out try a couple of test interviews of this because some of your inner reviews you might discover

118
00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:34.430
you want to tweak the position a subject and maybe change the background or even set them in a different

119
00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:35.420
chair.

120
00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:37.160
There's a lot of different things you can do.

121
00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:38.860
I guess that's the interview set up.

122
00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:40.070
I'll see you in the next lecture.
