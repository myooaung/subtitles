00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.270
Hey guys welcome back to the course.

2
00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.620
So in the last few lectures I've explained how different video makers can use common setups to arrange

3
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:13.900
cameras lighting mikes and more in order to produce nice looking and easily repeatable videos.

4
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.020
Well in this lecture.

5
00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:19.380
Well we got the third set up you can consider which is in fact one that goes back to the early days

6
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.600
of television and that is the talk show format now.

7
00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:27.570
Talk shows seem like they've been around for a million years and in video form he actually had to go

8
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.010
back to the days of black and white TV to see those first shows where a host would sit behind a desk

9
00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.190
and chitchat with some schmo trying to promote a new movie.

10
00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.800
Fast forward today and well things really aren't that much different but it still makes sense that they

11
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.020
use this format because it works.

12
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.510
There's a couple twists on it and there's a lot of popular YouTube channels you might find that use

13
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.470
a similar version of this but they all kind of come from the same roots.

14
00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.790
When you have people partaking in an engaging conversation about something you naturally get drawn in

15
00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.350
if they're funny or if they share something poignant or entertaining in any way.

16
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.020
Well I can't help but watch.

17
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.840
It's kind of just simulating Hey there's two people talking in a room and you're just eavesdropping.

18
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:14.000
Well in the case of marketing videos the talk show does have its place as well.

19
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.610
If you can round up a group of experts to talk about a topic Well you've got yourself a talk show.

20
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.820
But in the age of return on investment and YouTube and clicks and shares and tweets and all of that

21
00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.440
you probably wouldn't do a talk show.

22
00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.480
One time you'd do it many times to cover a lot of different topics talk to lots of people and get the

23
00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.580
most out of the equipment you bought.

24
00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.950
So in our case it's more than just a talk show format.

25
00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.150
It's really a video podcast.

26
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.280
So the first question becomes can you get everyone in the same room together or not.

27
00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.330
Let's assume you can.

28
00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:47.340
Well then you'll need a studio type setup with room for everyone could just be a really large room.

29
00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.790
Or oftentimes you have to rent some space.

30
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.480
Normally talk shows of a host and guests.

31
00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.820
So how many each will there be.

32
00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:01.180
Well you can have one host and one guest one host multiple gas two hosts and one guest Fox News have

33
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.800
to talk to each other all day and that's actually a pretty popular format as well.

34
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.480
Just remember as we talked in the last couple of years every person on screen is going to need to be

35
00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:15.780
well-lit miked up and shots so each individual person you add adds one more layer of complexity.

36
00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.030
Let me give you an example of the talk show format.

37
00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.640
Check out this video podcast.

38
00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.480
It's a YouTube channel acle channel called Screen Junkies and it's produced in a talk show format screen

39
00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.130
junkies produces a lot of videos about movies and TV from interviews and talk shows to those really

40
00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.320
funny honest trailers that you probably have heard of.

41
00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:37.770
And if you haven't sure you've heard the voice they use of the Furious.

42
00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.290
Wow these are getting really forced.

43
00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:45.870
Now in this case this is the movie fights series they make where they bring together a few movie bloggers

44
00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:51.540
or podcasters to basically debate a topic one of the first shots is a wide shot to establish where everyone

45
00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:52.570
is and who's there.

46
00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:58.020
You can see everyone is evenly spaced around the desk they've got you might have a desk or table or

47
00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.430
some other kind of set piece.

48
00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:02.070
Maybe you want your host on one side and the guests and the other.

49
00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:03.200
Figure out your layout first.

50
00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.820
And then we can go from there now screen junkies then uses two other cameras to basically split the

51
00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:09.540
room in half.

52
00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.500
So here on cameral one you've got the host on the left and one of the guests.

53
00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:20.310
Now they're being shot by a camera pointed straight at the two of them but almost always they'll be

54
00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.880
looking toward the right where the other guests are.

55
00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.510
And then on camera too you've got the other half of the room with the other two guests in the same type

56
00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:28.320
of shot.

57
00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.670
Again they're being shot straight on by the camera but to be looking towards the left now you obviously

58
00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.290
do this because you want to focus in on who is talking and you also an alternate.

59
00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:38.610
So that doesn't get boring.

60
00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.080
You need to establish where everyone is.

61
00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:45.680
You can't just use these two because that's really confusing you know what room you're in or who how

62
00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:46.010
all is.

63
00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:50.310
There are other people that are missing I can't even tell you right there you've got at least three

64
00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:51.090
different cameras.

65
00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.690
They have a wide shot and they have a camera for each side of the room that right there is actually

66
00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:55.890
kind of difficult.

67
00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:00.720
But again sometimes you can scrape together a lot of cameras from your friends and in a pinch you can

68
00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.600
throw on your iPhone to be the wide angle shot.

69
00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:08.370
Now if you tell the guests not to get up and walk around well then you can shoot a whole show like this

70
00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.570
about the need of a camera operator sitting in each Cameron to move them around at all.

71
00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:17.950
However we're limited to whatever angles and shots selections you set at the beginning of course in

72
00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:21.080
this situation you might have to have a remote to start the cameras.

73
00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.230
But those are usually pretty cheap.

74
00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:28.410
You can get those for like 20 bucks and now it is a lot of cameras have Wi-Fi like the one I'm using

75
00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.690
which connects to a phone so you can look at it and then started the case or the screen junkie's video

76
00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:37.950
Well they have a camera operator on each camera and allows them to create a nice sequence of shots obviously

77
00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.900
I mean I don't expect you guys have two camera operators so probably over the top but if you do become

78
00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.660
successful with the series you're making or you interview experts.

79
00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:48.000
Well maybe something worth considering at one point.

80
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.690
Now the two speakers on the right are talking and then it's clear that the guy on the right is going

81
00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:52.780
to get his own turn.

82
00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:58.830
So that is all to a shot from the movie and they're talking about it is always just a fade her memory

83
00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:04.060
fade or transitional is different kinds of it and that dissolve is kind of where you have one image

84
00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:08.950
and it kind of melts into the second one which you talk about more and we get to editing alternate transitions.

85
00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:13.400
Well the still shot of the movie is up then the camera operator zooms in on the guy to get a close up.

86
00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:18.020
Then they dissolve out of the still shot back to the camera and we see the guy by himself.

87
00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:21.880
The closeup is nice because it adds some more focus to the speaker while they talk.

88
00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:23.650
The problem is covering with the camera.

89
00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:28.090
Now you could conceivably have additional cameras getting close ups of each speaker but that would be

90
00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:31.210
kind of camera overload and just a management nightmare.

91
00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:35.680
Instead you can use this approach with camera operators zooming in and out to get the shot they need.

92
00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.400
Now does this sound like a lot of coordination.

93
00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:42.370
Well yeah I mean it's certainly more elaborate than your standard interview or whisky type shot but

94
00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:46.870
in the talk show format you can either record everything on each camera piece together or show after

95
00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:52.270
the fact or you can make a change is alive but just making using someone switching between the cameras

96
00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:58.750
that require unfortunately an operator and it's an additional level of equipment that you need.

97
00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:03.340
So I wouldn't necessarily do that unless you really hate editing and you really shouldn't be worried

98
00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:05.410
about doing that and editing it's quite easy.

99
00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:10.510
So you have three cameras there all simultaneously recording then and editing you kind of just take

100
00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:15.510
them sync them up and then at your computer decide I want to show this angle.

101
00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:16.900
Now they're saying oh now this thing.

102
00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:21.700
Now this angle it's really a lot less pressure and you don't have to be perfect to what you do because

103
00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:24.370
you can do it later and you always get someone to help you fix it if you screw it up.

104
00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:26.460
So that's how you would shoot a talk show like this.

105
00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:28.100
But how exactly would you light it.

106
00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:30.280
Well it's designed to make sure everyone is well lit.

107
00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:36.220
You may end up meaning an array of lights above the set lighting for your hosts and guests more lights

108
00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:39.630
behind the cameras can make sure the speakers don't have any shadows on them.

109
00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:43.030
In this case you're probably going to have to have at least four lights.

110
00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:47.210
Two of them will be pointing flat on to all of them.

111
00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:51.340
And that's just going to light them generically and then you know two that are different angles trying

112
00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:54.010
to catch the shadows that are created by the first one.

113
00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:58.840
And then of course you'll probably also need to light up your set behind the speakers just to make them

114
00:06:58.840 --> 00:06:59.920
stick out a little bit.

115
00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:03.280
That was relatively easy because you can just put small lights in the back.

116
00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:07.840
I think we talked before about these easy double LCD lights that are actually pretty cool because you

117
00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:12.490
can set them on the ground they naturally sit up and then you can use that as like a background like

118
00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:14.170
a bunch of torches use monitors.

119
00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:19.030
Now since they can easily be used to show graphics and everything look nice however obviously you don't

120
00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:24.940
need to do that now now audio in this situation is probably going to be handled by lavalier mikes or

121
00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:29.260
in the case of screen junkies what they actually have is they've got Mike set up on the desk in front

122
00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:34.180
of each person and it's really just a style question if you don't want the mike scene.

123
00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:39.200
These guys are kind of like nerdy kind of tacky So it's perfectly fine to have these.

124
00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:45.360
It's actually kind of almost like a chic thing to do because it makes you look like a podcast or a youtube

125
00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:50.290
or if you didn't want to have them seeing what you could do is have two shotguns pointed at each side

126
00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:53.220
and then have each person have its own lavalier.

127
00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:58.570
And then after the fact you kind of pick which audio is the best and usually you'd end up doing is one

128
00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:03.670
person one's talking you turn off the level of yours for two three and four and you do this all in editing.

129
00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:08.140
Now the question here becomes does it make sense for you to do a big production like this.

130
00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:12.910
Well days of screen junkies their product is a video series like this one so yeah they probably invested

131
00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:17.020
a lot into this one specific shot and this is their product.

132
00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:21.610
If you're using video for marketing purposes you might decide to take a different and much more affordable

133
00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:22.810
approach to the talk show.

134
00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:25.530
And that would be just like a web cam driven approach.

135
00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:30.490
Now instead of building shooting and lighting a set lots of actors just assemble experts and put together

136
00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:33.340
shows using webcams and screen recording software.

137
00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:39.160
For example social media marketing talk is essentially a talk show but without the set of cameras lighting

138
00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:43.960
and pretty much everything else all the speakers just use their own webcams might themselves up with

139
00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:45.100
whatever mikes they've got.

140
00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:48.030
And well everyone sees where it all ends up.

141
00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:52.930
The video and audio quality could be garbage depending on how much Wi-Fi or bandwidth each person has

142
00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:54.780
or the quality of the platform they're using.

143
00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:56.820
So it's kind of a hodgepodge.

144
00:08:56.860 --> 00:09:02.790
Here's my best advice if you want to do a Skype interview and or a Google Hangout interview like this.

145
00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:08.470
What I strongly suggest doing is that you coordinate with the person beforehand such that when they're

146
00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:16.150
recording their audio and the recording their video they're not recording what comes through Skype because

147
00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:21.000
Skype has to go through bandwidth and it can be delayed and it can be ugly and it can be pixilated.

148
00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:26.440
Instead get them to use a basic screen cast off or you can use like if you're on a Mac screen flow is

149
00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:32.650
really easy to use and it's a good trial if you're on a PC cam Tasia is fantastic what you can do is

150
00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:37.430
then just record locally on the hard drive their video and their audio.

151
00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:42.700
And that's got to be perfect because it doesn't have to go through the inter-webs and the terrible bandwidth

152
00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:45.190
or whatever Skype has all sorts of issues.

153
00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:48.800
Then what happens is you ask them to send the file afterwards and you sync it up.

154
00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:54.670
It's a lot more work but it will dramatically improve the quality of your interview.

155
00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:59.020
What I just described you where each person saves their own stuff locally and then syncs them together

156
00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:05.540
it's it actually a double ender in podcasting because you just use Skype to understand the other person

157
00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:09.680
saying See you can you can respond but then you all have local versions that are much better.

158
00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:11.720
Now of course you don't need to go to these ridiculous lengths.

159
00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:16.220
If you don't think that your interview needs to be super high quality it's perfectly fine for months

160
00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:21.040
like this prove you don't necessarily need a state of the art studio or expensive equipment to produce

161
00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:23.960
a show that people will listen or subscribe to.

162
00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:26.720
Really all comes down to what you're trying to get out of the production.

163
00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:29.540
As a marketer you want to share information or expertise.

164
00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:32.270
Does that require the presence of outside experts.

165
00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:36.600
Are those outside experts easier to get if they can chat from the comfort of their own home.

166
00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:42.110
Or maybe they're more enticed by having a larger production with the quality of their insights really

167
00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:45.550
be affected by the way they look or sound on screen.

168
00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:49.790
For a lot of people this line of questioning makes a solid case for going with the Web camera out with

169
00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:53.170
you talk show especially when you can save thousands of dollars and a whole lot of space.

170
00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:54.570
So which approach is better.

171
00:10:54.590 --> 00:11:00.230
Well quality wise from a video audio and everything standpoint clearly that studio approach is going

172
00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:00.800
to be better.

173
00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:07.090
Everything is lit while miked up and looking great but which one is easier and way easier to produce.

174
00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:11.660
Well that's going to be by far using a webcam version even if you use a double ender technique.

175
00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:13.130
So which one would you pick.

176
00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:14.480
Well that's clearly up to you.

177
00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:17.690
Again consider your goals and what kind of video product you want to deliver.

178
00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:22.190
Personally I'd say if you're going to do a lot of interviews and you can get these people to come in

179
00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:28.490
person then that's great and do it at least that way you can set up the studio once and like schedule

180
00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:30.340
people back to back or something like that.

181
00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:35.500
But if you're not sure how much you're going to do or you can interview people that are on their side

182
00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:40.420
of the world or just not they don't live where you live then try to just do the webcam version.

183
00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:44.960
And in that case then it's up to you if you want to spice it up whether you want to use a camera an

184
00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:49.580
actual camera instead of your webcam and then just sync that or if you want them to make sure that they

185
00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:50.850
save local versions.

186
00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:55.970
Now also keep in mind that the presentation may be part of the value you're trying to get across and

187
00:11:55.970 --> 00:12:00.350
you may want that glitzy production value that comes from bright lights and a super sweet set that is

188
00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:01.130
actually true.

189
00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:03.250
Sometimes people trust you more.

190
00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:07.850
They're more likely to share something if it looks like a big production it looks like it's done well.

191
00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:14.690
Yes scrappy iPhone videos that are poorly lit or shot on a webcam do go viral and are popular quite

192
00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:18.710
often but sometimes it's kind of the opposite.

193
00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:20.900
Or someone had that they just wouldn't take it seriously.

194
00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:22.750
So try to figure out where you are on the spectrum.

195
00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:25.480
Do you need production value that's really nice.

196
00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:29.110
Looks high quality and really kind of shows off your brand well.

197
00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:33.920
Or are you fine with getting it done and then just focusing on the content and the story how you into

198
00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:36.040
those questions will determine which route you go with.

199
00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:36.950
All right guys there you go.

200
00:12:36.950 --> 00:12:41.540
So with the talk show the interview and the wisdom shot for the last couple of lectures you've got three

201
00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:43.250
very common and effective setups.

202
00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:46.290
Think about Try testing them out and have some fun.

203
00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:48.630
Otherwise guys I'll see you in the next lecture.
