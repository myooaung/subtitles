00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.220
Hey guys welcome back to the chorus.

2
00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:02.510
OK.

3
00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.020
Over the last bunch of lectures I've told you about different tools and platforms you can use to come

4
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.680
up with different content ideas.

5
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.820
Well I've got one more for you and I'd like to tell you about a site called Corra not spelled c r a.

6
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:22.050
Q You are a now Corra dot com is a Web site where people can go and ask questions about literally anything.

7
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.540
Then other people answer those questions.

8
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:29.570
Presumably people who know the answer to the question and the best answers get voted so they followed

9
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.200
up to the top of the page.

10
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.270
Now some of these questions.

11
00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.890
Lots of responses and some get none.

12
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.420
And then there's plenty of them that fall somewhere in the middle.

13
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.360
At its best Couric and feel like virtual consulting or the person answering the question not only gives

14
00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.870
their answer but clarifies what the poster is looking for provides answers with context and even sprinkles

15
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.750
in some experience advice.

16
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.340
The best answers come in many forms because the questions do too but you'll know an answer is good when

17
00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.620
it gets lots of votes.

18
00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:03.600
What we're interested in is content creators or marketers whatever you want to call your role here is

19
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.010
finding ideas for creating content that our audience will obviously be interested in.

20
00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:14.250
Now all the questions asked on Quora or organized into topics and people interested in that topic we'll

21
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.370
follow it by clicking a button perhaps you can see where I'm going with this.

22
00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.320
So what we can do first is find our relevant topic.

23
00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.410
We'll see how many people are following it and see what people are asking the more questions they ask

24
00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:29.970
and the more followers we see the more interest we can generally assume is in that topic.

25
00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.340
Then we should check out the top questions within that topic group and consider if we can answer them

26
00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.060
in an interesting original way or present a different perspective.

27
00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.950
If so there's probably a good blog post idea that will generate some interest.

28
00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.790
So find our topics.

29
00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.050
Check out the questions and see if we can create something of our own out of them.

30
00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.360
Sounds pretty easy.

31
00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:51.480
All right let's try.

32
00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.750
All right.

33
00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.570
For example like in our Reddit lecture last time let's say you're a designer who works a lot in Photoshop.

34
00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.520
OK you need some blog topics so here we go.

35
00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.170
We're here we're in Corra and let's search for Photoshop at the top.

36
00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.770
Now the Adobe Photoshop topic pops up and that looks good.

37
00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.080
So let's click on that.

38
00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.600
Now this topic has over 6000 questions and almost half a million followers which you can see really

39
00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:15.600
over there on the right.

40
00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:21.570
And that's that's a lot as we scroll down some of the first questions here are about what pictures look

41
00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:25.820
photoshopped in and I'm not really interested in that personally right now.

42
00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.240
But did you keep scrolling down a little bit more I can see questions like How can I get started.

43
00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.360
Adobe Photoshop to create web graphics like this.

44
00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.700
Now this guy posted a picture of the type of work he wants to do and clearly you know he's looking for

45
00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:39.650
some advice.

46
00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:45.290
I can also see the top answer has over 200 votes so that's probably worth checking out.

47
00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.760
There's about forty one answers.

48
00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.590
Now the best one here is from the.

49
00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:49.620
Does going to be at the top.

50
00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.000
It's from a web developer named Navman Namond if you're out there I'm sorry for mispronouncing your

51
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.540
name.

52
00:02:54.570 --> 00:03:00.330
So the first thing Navman naman does and his answer is clarifying what it seems like the poster wants

53
00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:06.570
to do based on the original picture in question Namond name in surmises that this guy wants to not only

54
00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:10.000
learn Photoshop but specifically learn flat design.

55
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.810
Now once he establishes that the answerer adds a bunch of links to youtube channels and specific videos

56
00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:21.630
that specialize in that specific design style then at the end he gives a little more advise and suggest

57
00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:26.720
that illustrator might be a better tool for creating flat design elements versus Photoshop.

58
00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.590
It has to do with being a vector based whereas Photoshop is raster based.

59
00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.630
Whatever this is all good information.

60
00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.830
Now again his answer is the top one here.

61
00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.300
It's got to hurt folks.

62
00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.940
We know that people generally like what he said so how can you use this Corra thread to create your

63
00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:42.600
own content.

64
00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:48.190
Well you know it gives you a question to consider and an answer that's been supported by multiple readers.

65
00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:52.230
If you continue to browse answers you'll find some of them agree with the top post and a few others

66
00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.610
offer some alternate places to learn Photoshop and Illustrator.

67
00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.670
One way to use this Corra thread is to reformat the information and offer your own list of solutions.

68
00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:05.420
You can write a blog post like a great video for learning Flash design doesn't have to be 8.

69
00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.500
Just find some great videos and put that number in the title.

70
00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:09.750
See that was pretty easy.

71
00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:15.180
Or you could write how to modernize your design skills with flat design instead of of course assuming

72
00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.220
like the guy who asked the original question that you need Photoshop to do flat design.

73
00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:24.480
Let's focus on what flat design is and then worry about whether or not we're using the right tool.

74
00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:26.820
Just like that top answer suggested.

75
00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:32.040
So if you wrote this post you could use a few of the sources cited in the core answers and a few suggestions

76
00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:36.710
of your own and if it makes sense suggest your own services in the process like.

77
00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:37.590
Need more help.

78
00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.710
Once someone designed design a flat design site for you.

79
00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.500
Contact us today or whatever.

80
00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.890
Put in a link and there you go.

81
00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:50.010
Now by creating this post you delivered content people are interested in proven by the stats ancora

82
00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:56.120
and you've given some legit answers helped by Corra but also your own knowledge and your own research.

83
00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.970
And you've proven your own expertise in the process.

84
00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:03.980
All because someone assume that you create flat design with Photoshop and someone else out there took

85
00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:06.690
the time to explain how to really get it done.

86
00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:11.210
So if you can find your topic ancora then go take a look at it go up let search bar at the top start

87
00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:13.100
typing in it and see what you find.

88
00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:16.530
Now there are other ways to find content on core just like Google.

89
00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:18.300
You can search for a question.

90
00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:21.650
In fact since Chora is all about asking questions is actually a good idea.

91
00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:22.340
Try this.

92
00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:25.720
If your audience has common questions about your topic.

93
00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:29.370
For example Meteora a WordPress consultant.

94
00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:36.190
If so start typing in how do I install WordPress on and then see what questions get auto completed.

95
00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:40.540
Different platforms come up so you can see what people are looking for.

96
00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:44.510
Maybe you can write a whole series of instillation how to articles for each platform.

97
00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:47.620
I don't know I'm just spit balling or here's another example.

98
00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:52.560
Maybe you built an app that helps you record phone calls and export them automatically to Dropbox.

99
00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:57.650
You could simply start typing record phone calls and you'll see the questions that include those terms

100
00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:59.900
like people asking for apps that do that.

101
00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:04.610
An iPhone an Android where you might be able to do with this information is create a blog post that

102
00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:11.480
appeals directly to people with those devices how to record your phone calls on an iPhone or record

103
00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:14.270
and save phone calls on your Android device.

104
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:16.220
Those are some potential headlines.

105
00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:20.540
All right now there's one more angle to core that makes it an interesting place to find content ideas

106
00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:25.490
the community and more specifically the experts who contribute lots of great answers.

107
00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:30.320
Now some industry professionals writers and other experts have contributed a lot of answers about the

108
00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:31.570
topics they know.

109
00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:37.490
So what you can do is find those contributors and see what they write about on Quora what they provide

110
00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:40.370
usability testing services you don't know what that is.

111
00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:41.300
Don't worry about it.

112
00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:47.840
So you go to usability testing on a topic you click on the most viewed writers button and you see who

113
00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:48.980
comes up.

114
00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:53.270
This will then list out people with the most answer views in the last 30 days.

115
00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:59.060
Now theoretically sure it could mean that they maybe they just write a lot more often than not the first

116
00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:05.210
few people on that list are usually people who write a lot but also write good answers.

117
00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:09.350
So let's go to the top result in this case that somebody named Ava and I are trying to pronounce that

118
00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:09.840
last name.

119
00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:13.610
Can I ask yes the whatever and click them to look at their bio.

120
00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:16.440
Now do they look like a legit source of information.

121
00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:22.940
Sometimes I know it's a little bit hard to know for sure but do they have an actual title like CMO or

122
00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:30.550
engineer or a senior developer or do they list themselves as something vague like expert Jedi or Rockstar.

123
00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:33.790
If they seem OK look for their most uploaded answers.

124
00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:39.950
If they don't have anything over like a 1 or 2 vote kind of standard basically means they haven't really

125
00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:42.410
added anything new or interesting yet.

126
00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:47.830
So look for their top up vote it answers to different questions and read those.

127
00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:49.810
Do they seem like good answers.

128
00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:52.000
Does it seem like they know what they're talking about.

129
00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:57.320
If you're in this industry like the usability consulting you'll probably know if they're writing something

130
00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:02.410
valuable or just restating vague ideas this contributor looks like a good source.

131
00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:07.810
You now have a list of recent answers to a relevant topic that you can mind to look for tips and advice.

132
00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:13.370
Since they're on the most viewed writers list they've probably got a long list of potential topics you

133
00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:14.340
can write about.

134
00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:18.180
For example one of Eva's answers got up voted for this question.

135
00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:21.740
What is the difference between user testing and user research.

136
00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:26.690
This is certainly a question we get answer for our blog and we could use pieces of Avas response which

137
00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:29.470
lists online resources where you can learn more.

138
00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:30.270
Bingo.

139
00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:35.780
So in the end Coridon column is pretty helpful for answering questions one of ours being.

140
00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:37.360
What can we write about.

141
00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:38.600
Research your topic.

142
00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:44.090
Find those top questions look at the best responses and you might have your own angle you can create

143
00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:50.180
for your own piece of content and searching questions and contributors can also help you uncover more

144
00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:52.030
material that's worth covering.

145
00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:53.820
So start digging around.

146
00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:54.950
Have fun on that site.

147
00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:55.720
One of my favorites.

148
00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:56.420
And good luck.

149
00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:57.350
I'll see in the next lecture.
