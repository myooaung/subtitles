00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:05,640
Alright, guys, welcome back to the course. In the last 
lecture, we went over some Snapchat basic terms,
1

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:08,040
but you'll need to see these things for yourself,
2

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:12,230
so, in this lecture, let's create your account 
and get familiar with the app itself.
3

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:17,340
If you guys have a Snapchat account, either scan through 
this at 2x to see if there's something different that
4

5
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,010
you missed, or just skip the lecture.
5

6
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:22,150
First off, Snapchat doesn't have 
a special account for businesses.
6

7
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,820
Instagram, on the other hand, does.
7

8
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:29,370
So when you create an account, it's generally going to be 
the same process that you'd follow for a personal account.
8

9
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:29,760
So when you create an account, it's generally going to be 
the same process that you'd follow for a personal account.
9

10
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:35,100
Hence when I say Snapchat is emerging, it hasn't yet 
figured out how to let marketers use their platform,
10

11
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,920
so they don't even facilitate it.
11

12
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,800
The first thing you need to do is just download the app,
so, you know, if you're on Android go to Google
12

13
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,280
Store, if you're on iPhone, go to the Apple Store.
13

14
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:45,600
Once you do install it, go ahead and just follow these steps.
14

15
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,180
First thing you do is you just start up 
the app and then you click Sign Up.
15

16
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:53,230
Next, you'll be asked to enter your name and at 
some point you'll have to choose a username.
16

17
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:55,000
Since this account is going to be for your business,
17

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,560
well, then put your business name in there, and if 
possible, choose a username handle that's the same or
18

19
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,430
similar enough to the other social accounts you've created.
19

20
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:08,430
Generally speaking, if someone is interested in what 
you're doing and they see your Facebook account, they'll
20

21
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,380
look to see if you're on other platforms as well.
21

22
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:13,840
So let's say you sell dog food and 
you're @megachowfood on Twitter,
22

23
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:17,470
then try to get @megachowfood on 
Snapchat. Again, Snapchat is emerging,
23

24
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:19,520
so there's actually a lot of open handles,
24

25
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,720
wouldn't be surprised if you got exactly what you wanted.
25

26
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:25,930
The next thing is that during the set up, 
you'll also be asked to enter a date of birth.
26

27
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:27,400
So since you're a business,
27

28
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:28,960
well, you don't really have one.
28

29
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:30,660
So really, you just need to make that one up.
29

30
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:35,210
And yes, I know, that's technically illegal 
by an obscure law somewhere,
30

31
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,760
but anyway, the whole reason you put this in there 
is you have to be at least 13 years old to have a
31

32
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:43,710
Snapchat account, so put in a birth date that meets 
that requirement, maybe put in yours, it doesn't matter.
32

33
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:44,580
Snapchat account, so put in a birth date that meets 
that requirement, maybe put in yours, it doesn't matter.
33

34
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:45,140
Moving on.
34

35
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,820
Next up, you have to set a password,
35

36
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:51,330
so obviously pick a good one that's not password12345.
36

37
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:54,330
Don't be one of those people, 
especially with a business account.
37

38
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:59,640
My god, the amount of damage and extortion people 
can do to business accounts is really quite shocking.
38

39
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,650
The next thing they'll do is they'll
ask you for your phone number.
39

40
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:05,340
The reason why they do this is because when people 
sign up to Snapchat, one of the ways they'll add
40

41
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:10,110
other people is they'll add their contact list and then
it matches the phone number, it's very similar
41

42
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:16,300
if you've used WhatsApp, it kind of uses your 
phone number as your single identifying ID.
42

43
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:20,370
Now, if you have a mobile phone for your business with 
a unique number, obviously go ahead and enter that one,
43

44
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:20,740
Now, if you have a mobile phone for your business with 
a unique number, obviously go ahead and enter that one,
44

45
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:25,380
but a lot of people don't, so just know that you don't have 
to necessarily put in a phone number if you don't want to,
45

46
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,310
but a lot of people don't, so just know that you don't have 
to necessarily put in a phone number if you don't want to,
46

47
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:27,820
but you have to do some other things.
47

48
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,100
Part of the reason why you put the phone 
is also for verification purposes anyway,
48

49
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:36,720
but you can actually just use an email address instead,
you're just foregoing the opportunity that someone
49

50
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,800
who is in your contact list could add you. Anyway, just make 
sure that you enter a business email, not your personal one.
50

51
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,870
who is in your contact list could add you. Anyway, just make 
sure that you enter a business email, not your personal one.
51

52
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,650
Otherwise, you can get stuck. Either way, phone, email,
whatever, Snapchat is going to send you that verification
52

53
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:48,000
message, make sure you validate it,
53

54
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:49,250
and that's pretty much it.
54

55
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,090
But before you actually start using it,
55

56
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:57,030
let me give you a few tasks to do that will help you 
essentially learn this in a much more accelerated way.
56

57
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:57,420
let me give you a few tasks to do that will help you 
essentially learn this in a much more accelerated way.
57

58
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,980
The first thing I say is just make
sure to set up your Snapcode.
58

59
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,500
Now, most platforms allow you to set up a profile 
picture and put your logo up there, but not Snapchat.
59

60
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:12,120
If you tap the Snapchat logo in the upper left, you'll see 
a yellow square with a ghost, and that's the Snapchat
60

61
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,740
logo inside of it.
61

62
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:18,030
Well, this is your Snapcode, and you'll 
see little dots inside that yellow square.
62

63
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,890
People can use this to directly follow you,
63

64
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:22,800
so make sure to tap on it and download an image of it.
64

65
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:26,580
Then what you can do is you can post this to different 
places, like other social media accounts, to let people
65

66
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,710
know how to connect to you on Snapchat.
66

67
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:32,580
One common thing to do is when you just open your 
Snapchat account, you take your profile photo and you
67

68
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:37,860
change your other profile photos to that, like on Facebook or on 
Twitter, and that lets people know, hey, we just joined Snapchat.
68

69
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:38,400
change your other profile photos to that, like on Facebook or on 
Twitter, and that lets people know, hey, we just joined Snapchat.
69

70
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:42,090
Obviously, don't leave that there permanently, 
but it's a good way of getting other people to join.
70

71
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:45,030
Now, here's the second thing you should do right now.
71

72
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:48,770
Sign yourself up for an app called GhostCodes.com.
72

73
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:50,550
What is GhostCodes.com?
73

74
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:52,320
Trust me, we will get into this later.
74

75
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:56,250
Now, one of the things about Snapchat 
that kind of sucks is discovery,
75

76
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,590
meaning it's not really that easy 
to find other people's profiles.
76

77
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:05,700
Ghost Codes is essentially a directory of Snapchat 
users organized by topic, and a much easier way
77

78
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:09,800
to find and follow people in your 
industry or wherever you want to look.
78

79
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:11,680
Remember Product Hunt, for example?
79

80
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:14,690
Well, you can find them under the Entrepreneur category.
80

81
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:20,940
Ghost Codes also has a point system called kudos, 
where users upvote your profile in your category, making
81

82
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,150
it easier to find you.
82

83
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:24,860
So make sure you put yourself in the right category.
83

84
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:29,490
Navigating around Snapchat isn't so 
much menu-driven as it is swipe-driven.
84

85
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:33,810
One thing that drives me a little bit nuts about 
Snapchat is that all apps out there like to follow
85

86
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:37,400
the same general rules for how 
you navigate around them,
86

87
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:41,100
and the reason why they do that is 
so it's easier for people to use it.
87

88
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:47,040
We get used to certain things, having a menu button 
in the top right or the top left, having a profile
88

89
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:50,850
icon somewhere that I could click 
and takes me to the home. Snapchat
89

90
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,660
decided to purposely not do that.
90

91
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:58,530
And the reason why, and I think this is kind of 
hilarious, is that they know their demographic,
91

92
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:02,220
they're usually under 20, these people 
didn't grow up with Facebook,
92

93
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:09,470
they want to actually make it difficult for people 
who are not in their demographic to learn it.
93

94
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:11,680
* Oh wait a minute. *
94

95
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:19,080
* What did I do? Ugh, that's ugly. I think I hit the wrong thing. 
Dude. What's this stopwatch in the bottom? Is that my timer? *
95

96
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,520
* Who would ever do one second? *
96

97
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,630
* That would be just rude. 
Now, where are my filters? *
97

98
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:27,580
So it's kind of like sitting down at the lunchroom, 
you don't want your parents to sit down with you.
98

99
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:28,690
How do you do that?
99

100
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:30,020
Well, I don't know.
100

101
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:34,860
You spray water on the ground around it and make
it freeze into ice so they literally can't get to it.
101

102
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,380
That's the Snapchat equivalent.
102

103
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:36,690
Yes.
103

104
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:38,970
I personally think it's ridiculous, 
and if you agree with me,
104

105
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:42,140
you can post in the Slack chat,
but hey, that's what they did.
105

106
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:46,860
Now, when you first create your account, you'll probably 
end up on that camera view where you'll be basically
106

107
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:50,490
in the camera mode, but with a 
big white circle at the bottom.
107

108
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:54,740
Now, guys, they change the UI for this all the time, so if it's 
slightly different when you're watching this, don't freak out.
108

109
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:55,930
Now, guys, they change the UI for this all the time, so if it's 
slightly different when you're watching this, don't freak out.
109

110
00:05:55,950 --> 00:06:01,530
Now, that's your snap button, that is what you use to 
take photos with. Camera options are at the top right.
110

111
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:05,630
Keep this in mind though, you don't always have 
to take your photos through the Snapchat app,
111

112
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:08,820
you can actually take it through your regular 
camera and then upload it through Snapchat.
112

113
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:15,300
The other sections of the app are Chat, Stories, Discovery, 
and Memories. Now, Chat is where you can add
113

114
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:20,400
your friends, the people you want to connect with and 
follow, and then send pictures or videos to them directly.
114

115
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,360
your friends, the people you want to connect with and 
follow, and then send pictures or videos to them directly.
115

116
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,570
Stories is where you can create a story.
116

117
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:28,140
Remember, it's a collection of pictures and videos 
which is available for your friends to check out for
117

118
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,970
I think it's 24 hours.
118

119
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:32,370
You can also see their stories, if they post any,
119

120
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:37,230
along with some featured stories which come from,
you know, the big brands. Now, Discover is basically the
120

121
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:43,170
sponsored section of stories with a much longer list of 
brands ranging from National Geographic to Esquire
121

122
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:46,780
to Comedy Central to Wired, whatever, many, many more.
122

123
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,510
We only go to these for inspiration on what to post 
and otherwise they're pretty much worthless. Now,
123

124
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:54,750
Memories is a section where you 
can view any saved snaps and stories.

00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:58,760
So, in reality, Snapchat actually doesn't 
delete all of your pictures and videos.
125

126
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,810
You have to choose to save them, of course,
126

127
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:04,710
and when you do, well, they're going to show 
up here. To get to each Snapchat section,
127

128
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:11,250
think of the camera screen as like your home screen, 
and then you swipe left or right to go to a new section.
128

129
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:13,460
It's like an invisible navigation bar.
129

130
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:16,170
You can also just use the icons 
at the bottom of the screen,
130

131
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:18,850
although... Snapchat drives me crazy.
131

132
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:24,180
Anyway, to get to Memories, you go to the camera 
mode and you swipe up or click the small circle on the
132

133
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,730
bottom center of the screen.
133

134
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:30,180
Yes, anyway, so that's basically the app. You can take 
pictures and videos and you can send them to people
134

135
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:36,660
through chat, save some to your memories, and 
view other people's stories or sponsored posts.
135

136
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:40,440
Now, this is a good place to pause, because if you haven't 
been in the app before, it's really worth checking out,
136

137
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:40,960
Now, this is a good place to pause, because if you haven't 
been in the app before, it's really worth checking out,
137

138
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:46,530
testing out some of the features, and seeing what everything does. It's designed to be counter-intuitive,
138

139
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:49,610
so it's worth spending 10 minutes
just kind of messing around with it.
139

140
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:54,180
In our next lecture, we're going to talk about what to 
do first as a brand on Snapchat, including advice
140

141
00:07:54,180 --> 00:08:00,180
on snaps you can take and how to connect and 
promote yourself specifically on their platform.
141

142
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:00,890
Alright guys, see you then.
