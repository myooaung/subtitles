1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:01,710
All right guys welcome back.

2
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:07,090
Here we are with our grand finale the last lecture of our video marketing series Abdulla's point.

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:11,310
You've covered everything you need to know about the three phases of video production and most recently

4
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:16,620
how to get or fantastic the is hosted somewhere so you could put them on your site.

5
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:21,930
Now obviously we have taught every single thing you could possibly know because that would take roughly

6
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:23,590
nine to 10 years.

7
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:27,820
However we covered the crash course the basics of what you need to know to actually be effective.

8
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:32,990
The last piece of this whole puzzle is this question How can you tell if what you're doing is working

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:33,600
and video.

10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,120
Great question and it's the subject of this lecture we got right here.

11
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:41,700
First of all you have to know where your analytics are where all the stats you'll be checking to see

12
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:42,820
what's working or not.

13
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,690
If you use a platform like YouTube to host your videos here's a hack.

14
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:52,980
Just go to YouTube dot com slash analytics and you'll see a very Google analytic view of your top videos

15
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,830
video views where people watch from and so on and so forth.

16
00:00:55,830 --> 00:01:00,430
These are basic stats you get for the free service you're getting for free.

17
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:03,330
Pretty decent but paid services offer a lot more obviously.

18
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:05,780
Now we just just paid video hosting our last lecture.

19
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:09,190
Places like Vidyarthi wisdom sprout video etc..

20
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:11,060
So review that lecture if you need to.

21
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:16,770
Overall paid host will give a lot more detailed analytics about your videos but there can be a lot to

22
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:17,280
look at.

23
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,750
So really the question remains how can you tell if it's working.

24
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:26,190
The basic numbers like video views shares and likes help you see what people are reacting to and it's

25
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:28,650
a good first round type of indicator.

26
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:33,220
If a video really takes off and connects with people and those basic numbers will reflect that.

27
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:38,010
But the bigger question you have to keep in mind is are these videos helping you reach your business

28
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:38,700
goals.

29
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,290
Why did you start making these videos in the first place.

30
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:45,540
How was it to increase sales generate leads or make people more aware of you.

31
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:51,370
Chances are since we're trying to get our first 500 customers that's why you did video marketing proud

32
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:57,370
because you have 50 or 100 or whatever and you need something larger more consistent more long term.

33
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:02,220
But how you get to sales obviously doesn't really matter more brand awareness needs more people know

34
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:07,200
to buy from you more leads means more people you can potentially get to buy from you and more sales

35
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,490
just mean more sales.

36
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:12,840
So to get to the real impact of these videos I recommend checking out these stats.

37
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,070
Number one check out the percentage of video watched.

38
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:16,710
OK.

39
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:19,260
That means how long people stay tuned onto the video.

40
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,490
It's an interesting stat once you consider this industry trend.

41
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:27,300
Sixty five percent of video viewers watch more than three quarters of a video.

42
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,270
Now if you don't have sixty five percent of your viewers watching.

43
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,200
Seventy five percent of your video.

44
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:34,320
That means that you are below the baseline.

45
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:38,060
Maybe there's an issue but also keep in mind that the general statistics.

46
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:42,600
It really does depend on what type of video you're making and what industry are and bought but this

47
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,620
is a great place to start.

48
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,720
That stat can give you an idea whether or not your video is working.

49
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,480
Is it interesting or valuable.

50
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,750
Don't really be worried about people punching out right before the end.

51
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:56,610
When people have what they need and they anticipate the end they often will just click away before some

52
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,400
canned outros starts playing.

53
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:03,120
But if you haven't called the action plan for them maybe move that a little bit forward or tell people

54
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,380
about it before the end.

55
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:08,250
OK another thing check out is the ratio of page visits to video views.

56
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:13,380
That is if you embed the video on your page you want to know if anyone is actually watching it.

57
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:18,480
So for this you might require a little bit of math but you can do it I believe and you look at the percentage

58
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,220
of the people who visit a page where you have a video embedded you had a Google Analytics and you look

59
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,980
at how many people actually look at the page.

60
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:29,820
You can look at it in unique visitors or more realistically you should probably look at the page views

61
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:34,170
then what you do is you take that number and compare that to the number of views your video got in the

62
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:35,700
video analytics platform.

63
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:40,770
If less than say 50 percent of people are watching the video maybe the video looks interesting or it

64
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:46,440
might not make sense on that page or they actually don't see the video or there's no obvious reason

65
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,520
why they should play it.

66
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:51,380
But if the percentage is higher than well you probably got a good fit.

67
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:57,270
So are you taking advantage of that high view percentage to get people to take action afterwards.

68
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:01,680
A call to action at the end of the video like clicking a button or entering an e-mail address to get

69
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,250
more info to sign up for something or to download a demo.

70
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:06,110
Make sure you do that.

71
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:07,120
Can't say it enough.

72
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:10,880
Your video can support the goal you have especially the videos performing well.

73
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:16,530
So use analytics to improve your videos and to improve the ways you place and use your videos to support

74
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:17,250
your marketing.

75
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,910
Get in the habit where you check the numbers periodically.

76
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,850
Maybe once a week figure out a system so you don't go months without looking.

77
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,880
In the end don't get too hung up on absolute numbers.

78
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:32,120
There are many ways to gauge the success of individual videos and your video efforts as a whole.

79
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:36,210
Be sure to pay attention to all the information coming in from the dashboards on your video hosting

80
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:42,570
platforms to comments emails and more engagement in the form of shares and comments can lead to discussions

81
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:45,190
of viewers and customers better quality and placement.

82
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:49,530
Videos should lead to higher quality of people who complete the forums.

83
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:54,570
Not that you know there are higher quality people just that there are much better matches for the type

84
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:56,370
of customer or contacts you want.

85
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:57,230
So there you go.

86
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:01,880
Everything you need to know about video marketing how to create videos use them and measure them.

87
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:05,400
We've covered a lot of ground had some laughs but now it's your turn.

88
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,620
So get out there and create some videos.

89
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,890
If you're stuck just hit record.

90
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,150
Try to use some of the common formats we cover.

91
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:18,090
Try to fill in the gaps where you see problems in your marketing funnel and let the magic of video take

92
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:18,690
you forth.

93
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,650
Oh and also make sure to check your analytics make sure people are watching the video completing the

94
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:25,770
video and doing something at the end of it.

95
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:26,670
All right guys you got it.

96
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:30,710
Next we're moving on to the Get your thousand customers section.

97
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,680
We're going to start off with you.

98
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,300
So either.
