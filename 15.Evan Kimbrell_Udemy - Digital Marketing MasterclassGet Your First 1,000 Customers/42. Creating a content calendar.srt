00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:01,710
Hey guys welcome back.

2
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:06,750
So in the last few lectures we talked about creating your own posts creating them for others as a guest.

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:10,300
And then finally how to promote all that stuff that you made.

4
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:12,390
Well I know that's a lot of work.

5
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:17,460
And if you're like me you're looking for some way to organize all of these efforts lists and spreadsheets

6
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:22,830
will help you organize things up to a point but once you start publishing content and taking this really

7
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:25,950
seriously it becomes a bit like a machine.

8
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:29,340
You've got to maintain that progress or it's going to break down.

9
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:35,130
So the content marketers out there that are serious about keeping that machine going usually create

10
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:37,320
what we call a content calendar.

11
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,560
If you haven't heard of a content calendar before.

12
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:47,510
Guess what pretty much any large blog any large publication or even people who just take their blogs

13
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:49,660
seriously will have one of these.

14
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,930
It is industry standard in the simplest terms a content calendar is a system you can use to help you

15
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:58,010
keep on schedule with creating and publishing content.

16
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:04,560
It also helps for coordination especially when you start bringing in researchers collaborators other

17
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:08,060
writers graphic design artists.

18
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:11,220
There's a lot of different other people who could participate.

19
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:17,880
Generally speaking you plug each blog post and other items into deeds in a calendar depending on when

20
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:23,160
you want them to go live or when you plan on starting the process and then publishing what you have

21
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:29,070
and now you can do this any number of ways there are actually softwares out there that are solely dedicated

22
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:29,780
to this.

23
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:35,310
And usually it's a literal calendar like in a Google calendar for example.

24
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:41,310
Now I might also be in some cases a spreadsheet like in one column you plug in the dates when you think

25
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,410
you'll be publishing in the next column you put the title of each post.

26
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:48,930
Or if you want and you want to get serious about this you could use one of those apps dedicated to it.

27
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:54,750
Like I just mentioned before probably the best well known on and one that I've used before is called

28
00:01:54,750 --> 00:02:00,410
Code schedule which basically lets you and your team certainly if you have a team manager blogs manage

29
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:06,450
your social media and manage a lot of other different content within your calendar like task lists and

30
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:11,990
other integrations with apps it tries its best to kind of put an umbrella over everything you would

31
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,540
need in writing researching collaborating putting it together scheduling and then publishing and promoting

32
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:19,360
your content.

33
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:23,280
Now however you create this calendar based on how serious you are.

34
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:28,420
You do need to have some kind of system especially if you're to take content marketing seriously.

35
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:33,180
Let's be honest here all of us get a little too busy and get interrupted by things to be of any use

36
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:36,300
to anybody unless we have a system to help us do it.

37
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:41,190
How many of you don't have a calendar at all and can remember every single thing you always have to

38
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:41,920
do.

39
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:46,320
Basically no one if you want to wake up in the morning use an alarm clock if you want to keep track

40
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:46,900
of your money.

41
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:51,660
Use a banking app accounting calendar is that system and helps you focus on creating a post and getting

42
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,190
it done within a certain amount of time.

43
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:58,380
And the reason I keep harping on using a system like content calendars is because content marketing

44
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:00,930
works best when it's consistently published.

45
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:03,720
People see a cool blog post or video from you.

46
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,490
They'll probably look for more.

47
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:10,440
If you only publish when you feel like it there's no guarantee they'll find enough stuff that will make

48
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,940
them think you're worth following.

49
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,730
But also you'll lose their attention.

50
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:19,770
People who want to follow a brand have an affinity for them and want to and what you publish into their

51
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:24,280
consumption diet will look for a steady stream of things.

52
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:28,530
Just in general like if you have an email list if you keep e-mailing people to they'll stay more engaged.

53
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:31,710
So when you ask for something you want more people will react.

54
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,700
It's really the same thing with blogs.

55
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:38,730
No not saying you need to post every five minutes but I want you to do is make sure you have a steady

56
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:40,980
stream of posts and other content.

57
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:47,640
There's a concept called a publishing cadence meaning how often you publish so it doesn't matter if

58
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,840
your cane says I post twice a day.

59
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:50,970
I post once a day.

60
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:52,200
I post once a week.

61
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,700
The point is you're consistent.

62
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,830
People get used to it.

63
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,460
Now this is a bit of a side note but have you ever heard a concept of the 12 touch rule.

64
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:02,290
Well in sales basically what they say is that you have to touch.

65
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:09,870
Not like that you prospect at least 12 times either through email calls them reading about you hearing

66
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:14,270
about you or some interaction before they on average convert.

67
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:20,230
You can actually look at the conversion stats on like email for instance you'll get after one email.

68
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:27,960
2 percent conveyer after 3 emails 5 percent after 7 emails you have another 5 percent and for some reason

69
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:33,130
around 12 you start noticing a large uptick in people converting.

70
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:36,390
The point here is that in sales one touch isn't good enough.

71
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:40,260
So in content marketing very similarly one post isn't good enough.

72
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:46,350
Another benefit to a Condon calendar worth mentioning is that it does also help you kind of keep a mental

73
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:51,690
check on how much content you have in the pipeline coming very easily look at a content calendar and

74
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:54,360
go oh wow we have nothing to publish.

75
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,940
We need to think of stuff quickly.

76
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:01,110
Or look at it and say hey we need to stop spending time brainstorming we have way too much stuff to

77
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:05,820
write right now because of the benefits of the content count right it's a helpful system helps you schedule

78
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:09,070
your content helps you publish content on a consistent basis.

79
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:15,000
And it can serve as a reminder to restock your ideas for your blog post fridge or other content because

80
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,050
he might be wondering now when you say publish content on a consistent basis.

81
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:20,400
Now what exactly do I mean.

82
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:25,320
How often should I be publishing what should my publishing cadence be and how that's really going to

83
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,240
be up to you.

84
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:31,940
Larger companies that have more people reading them are going to publish more often.

85
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:37,050
But then also you can look at places that publish longer form content and their cadence is going to

86
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:38,920
be a lot slower.

87
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:43,080
Well it really is probably going to happen is that your publishing frequency you're publishing Canaan's

88
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:46,000
is most likely to be tied to how many resources you've got.

89
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:49,920
You don't have to consider how much time you'll be spending on creating content versus all the other

90
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,630
pieces of your business.

91
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:56,820
Remember this is only one channel and that's why generally guys mind when I say we're going to look

92
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:57,670
at traction channels.

93
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:03,780
I generally say pursue one or two at a time because it's impossible to pursue all you know 15 at once

94
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:07,940
then what you can say is you know if it works out then I can spend a lot more time towards it.

95
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:11,610
But you're really going out to be conscious that this is going to take 100 percent of your time.

96
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:13,330
How much time can you give it now.

97
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,390
If for instance you already have multiple people on your team that are going to be helping you while

98
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,700
you can produce more.

99
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,820
But let's assume it's just you.

100
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:23,550
Because most operations are generally going to start out that way.

101
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:29,580
So really if it's just you it's going to come down to how much time you have how productive you are

102
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,790
and in general what how often you think your audience wants to hear from you.

103
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:37,940
I'm not going to lie and say that there's some formula that says if it's just you and your X-amount

104
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:42,900
of age old and you have this much time in the day you should publish three times a week or whatever

105
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:43,610
it is.

106
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:49,770
What I'm going to say is just first start off with something that's kind of moderate Sarraf with something

107
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:52,010
that's like let's say twice a week.

108
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:52,390
OK.

109
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:57,960
You want to go short posts or maybe once a week if you want to go with a long post and then adjust accordingly.

110
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:02,120
You can very easily quick to figure out that hey this is way too hard.

111
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:06,000
Or hey I have a lot of extra time this is a lot easier.

112
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:08,150
My audience wants more and I can do more.

113
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,690
Also around that time you'll you'll be figuring out whether or not content marketing is going to work

114
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:13,270
for you.

115
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:18,120
So how can you get started with this whole content calendar scheduling thing.

116
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:22,050
Well there's a great model that makes a lot of sense for people creating a calendar for the first time

117
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:27,000
for the purposes of this example let's just open up an Excel or a Google sheet and do it in a spreadsheet.

118
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:30,610
Now first off let's just create a basic calendar.

119
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,020
No seven days in the week.

120
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:35,210
Sunday through Saturday or however we like to set up your week whatever.

121
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:38,940
Then when you can do is you can set up your month by labeling each week.

122
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:41,650
We can do week one week to three and four.

123
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:46,280
That's really all we need for right now we don't need to make some multi year thing right now.

124
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:49,320
We don't know if Content Marketing is going to be a channel for us.

125
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:55,430
So even month one let's just start off by publishing one poster to post a week that is totally doable.

126
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,950
It means you need to save for good post ideas to get started for that month.

127
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,470
That then gives you time to prep and create each one month one is a good month to experiment with publishing

128
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:06,010
on different days of the week as well.

129
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:11,970
Keep in mind one day the week might work better than others and it's just going to depend on your industry

130
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,750
and your audience.

131
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:17,800
So try to test it out here because they're all post in let's say Week 1 let's put it on a Tuesday and

132
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,350
then a week to put the Post on Thursday and then Monday and then Wednesday and weeks three and four

133
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:27,170
after this month you should have a decent idea of which one roughly did better than the other.

134
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:31,140
And the reason for different days is so you can essentially look at the results of each post and see

135
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,530
which one performed best.

136
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:34,800
But you know the Analects we set up a while back.

137
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:35,580
I hope you did.

138
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:39,000
You can track the number of views and see the number of comments and social shares.

139
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,020
Now how do we know if we posted something and it did well because of the day of the week or because

140
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,570
of the content was better.

141
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:50,280
Well you just have to kind of tease this out in the analytics generally is pretty easy to tell.

142
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,120
Right.

143
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:57,300
If when you post it on you or you're promoting on Twitter or Facebook or whatever and you posted and

144
00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:01,260
you look at the page views or how many people came to the page.

145
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:05,620
That's generally an indication of how many people are paying attention that day when we send an e-mail

146
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,170
how many people click through.

147
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:13,290
Generally an indication of how many people read it but then you need to look at the goal of the post.

148
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:18,710
How many people then went to sign up how many people stayed for long periods of time on the page.

149
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:23,850
Those type of metrics that's going to tell you if the post itself was good or because it anyway after

150
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:27,160
month one is over let's just go back and look at your results.

151
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:28,650
How many views of each one get.

152
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:34,920
Maybe it's a case that on Monday you got the most views whereas you know the content you posted the

153
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:39,860
next week has the best ratio of views to sign ups or whatever your goal was.

154
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:40,760
OK that's great.

155
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:45,510
Well that gives us some ideas for experiments that we could do theoretically in month two and then maybe

156
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:52,440
next month we could publish each week on a specific day and then see if that performance we predicted

157
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,640
actually plays out.

158
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:59,130
So in month two let's just say we stay with the once a week frequency but now we'll post each week on

159
00:09:59,190 --> 00:09:59,810
Monday.

160
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:03,470
You know whatever day you you figure out you think is best.

161
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:07,380
Now here in our spreadsheet will just duplicate our sheet pretty easy change of names here from month

162
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:10,960
one month to and now will move all of our publishing days to Monday.

163
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:17,220
So still for post this month's now on a Monday the idea here is that month after month you can basically

164
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:20,150
take the learnings from the first month and then roll them forward.

165
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:25,740
You can throttle up your cadence or throttle down your publishing cadence you can settle on a day of

166
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:31,890
the week you can settle on which types of content seem to do the best whatever it is and then take that

167
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:37,050
learning from month 1 into month three if you obviously continue to pursue content marketing.

168
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:40,950
By the end of the second month you should have a pretty good system in place for creating the post.

169
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:46,260
Now it should be more natural now to prep and to draft and to edit and in general know how long it takes

170
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:50,730
you to produce something you're probably looking for ways to make this whole writing process easier

171
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:55,110
for yourself because at some point we're going to increase the load potentially a little bit.

172
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:59,990
So let's say in month three we decided to uptick our publishing canes.

173
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:05,640
So in month three we could you know keep our weekly posts on Monday or whatever day but somewhere in

174
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,080
there will.

175
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,950
And one more post in the month.

176
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:12,810
So here on the schedule we can easily just duplicate her sheet again change the name to month 3 and

177
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:16,520
we'll add an extra post let's say in week three of Wednesday.

178
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:21,210
You know I'm just picking out obviously randomly so obviously you could have like a total of five post

179
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:21,710
that month.

180
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,310
It could be whatever day you want.

181
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:24,830
This is just one way of representing it.

182
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:29,490
So you know you would see how that goes not just from a performance standpoint like did that extra post

183
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:32,960
get views and engagement but also could you actually handle it.

184
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:37,620
Was that extra post a pain or you know was it worth the pain.

185
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:42,340
And is it possible you could handle the extra work if this is the case that you think that content marketing

186
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:46,450
worked works for you but you're just maxed out in terms of your time.

187
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:46,990
Be the case.

188
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:53,220
We start looking at working with freelancers or working with pretty much anyone who can help you unburden

189
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:55,230
some of the load scripted dot.com.

190
00:11:55,230 --> 00:12:00,360
They're kind of like a marketplace looking for freelance writers that can fit your needs are experts

191
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,390
in different areas.

192
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:05,430
That one is definitely worth checking out and get a wide range of people some are really cheap and some

193
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:09,360
are not free and then you know theoretically in this content counter if you're doing all right that

194
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,500
in month four we could add another post.

195
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:16,100
You know maybe you're already out of the post and retirees and we got an extra one in week one year

196
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:17,350
you're still doing well for that.

197
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:21,900
And yet another post and month five and another one month six busier what you'll end up with and you

198
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,980
can see this here in our spreadsheet is to post a week in month six.

199
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:30,300
So if you follow that plan you'll have gone from publishing zero post amount to eight and in six months

200
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,690
you'll have published a total of 34 posts.

201
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:38,100
I don't know if you've noticed this but all we did was slowly uptick something that you previously established

202
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:43,370
as doable and we slowly just increased it as your efficiency increased and there you go now you're 34

203
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,960
34 posts which really is not nothing.

204
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:50,100
All right so if you like this approach Well then I think Coast Gadgil is a great resource for additional

205
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:54,230
information at putting together a calendar and scheduling content especially with the app they have.

206
00:12:54,240 --> 00:13:00,660
You really have to use their app but their blog is really focused on how to make the best content calendar

207
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:06,660
you can if you're starting off at the very beginning and want to keep this simple I suggest just keep

208
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,580
it simple and use an ax spreadsheet.

209
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:12,850
And then if you decide to get serious about it then I think you can justify paying the like $30 a month

210
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,250
they cost because that is an example of a content calendar.

211
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,280
You don't need to pay for it.

212
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,790
You can just make it in a spreadsheet very very quickly.

213
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:25,950
But more important than the structure in the system is the process of learning that kind of goes along

214
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:26,340
with it.

215
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:30,200
Make sure you use something to schedule your posts to predict it.

216
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:36,660
People generally expect publishing consistency or publishing cadences if you don't do that well and

217
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:40,830
you kind of lose the attention of your audience and therefore anything you do in the future will be

218
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:41,540
less effective.

219
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:49,950
So commit to a very liberal a very easy schedule at first try to roll the learning onto each successive

220
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:58,080
month and really after four or five months if you keep at a very low burn schedule you should have a

221
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,520
lot of posts 34 blog posts.

222
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,500
That's you know that's a full blog.

223
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:06,320
All right guys hopefully that adds a little bit of structure to the process for you to do that.

224
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:08,740
Guys who found this promising and want to go down that path.

225
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:13,350
The next we're going to talk about how you can figure out whether or not everything you've been doing

226
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:18,300
until this point is actually working that is actually a tricky question to answer.

227
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:19,140
So I'll see the.
