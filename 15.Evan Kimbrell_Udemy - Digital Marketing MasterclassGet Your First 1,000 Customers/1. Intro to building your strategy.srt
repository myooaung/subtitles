Hey guys, welcome back to the course. In this section,
1

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:07,480
we're going to spend time planning a strategy
for growth that fits your specific use case.
2

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:13,410
The strategy that works for a SAAS software company
that helps developers catch and record bugs is going
3

4
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:19,530
to be different than, say, the strategy for a business
that manufactures toasters that let you imprint
4

5
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:24,020
low resolution photos you made on
your iPhone onto your breakfast toast.
5

6
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:26,480
That last one in fact has no strategy.
6

7
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:32,130
No one is going to buy that, and if anyone
listening works for Toasteroid, please call me.
7

8
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:34,160
I would love to become your spokesman. Anyway,
8

9
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:40,770
such is the case that if we systematically chase growth
channels, well, some are going to work out better than others.
9

10
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:41,590
such is the case that if we systematically chase growth
channels, well, some are going to work out better than others.
10

11
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:47,400
Which one works out depends largely on who you are
as a person and what your business naturally fits
11

12
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:52,210
into. Your Chowpatti stand is probably not going to crush it
12

13
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:57,060
in the viral marketing channel. And as I will say and
continue to say throughout the course, guess what?
13

14
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:57,920
in the viral marketing channel. And as I will say and
continue to say throughout the course, guess what?
14

15
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:04,740
You only need one traction channel to work for you
and then you could become very successful.
15

16
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:09,450
The vast majority out there get zero channels to work.
16

17
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:13,780
So if you get one, you are on a rocket ship to Planet Money.
17

18
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:16,070
OK, next lecture, we're going to talk about you.
18

19
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:20,970
So, yes, you can step away from the mirror and stop
admiring your cheekbones for a second, because, hey,
19

20
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:27,240
we're going to talk about you. And hey, you're also
probably not going to miss out a whole lot, unless
20

21
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,270
of course you are chiseled and not at all like me,
21

22
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:31,350
a potato face.
22

23
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:31,770
All right, guys.
23

24
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:32,780
See you in the next lecture.
