00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,490
Hey guys, welcome back to the course.
1

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:02,720
OK.
2

3
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:07,500
So a few lectures ago we learned how to
draft an email and send it out to our network.
3

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:12,150
Now, in this lecture, we're going to flip that script a little
bit and now we're going to network with new people.
4

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,510
Now, in this lecture, we're going to flip that script a little
bit and now we're going to network with new people.
5

6
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:14,580
How terrifying.
6

7
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,040
Why do we have to meet new people?
7

8
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:19,000
Well, because then we can sell them our thingamabob.
8

9
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:22,640
This lecture is, yes, all about going to in-person events.
9

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:29,020
Yes, I know, you're thinking right now they are
mostly awful and can feel like a waste of time.
10

11
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:34,410
I agree, but that's where I have to kind of stop you,
because they are an easy way to get your first 10
11

12
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:38,580
done and you can do it in one go if you do it right.
12

13
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:44,820
Now, events come in all shapes, sizes, and dollar amounts.
Because we're still getting our first 10 customers,
13

14
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:50,740
I'm going to stick with the smaller meetups rather
than those big conferences of the big trade shows.
14

15
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:57,720
Now, those bigger events can be a huge time suck and
are usually way too expensive early on when you're
15

16
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:01,020
just trying to get 10 customers. That stuff just doesn't work,
16

17
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,980
I wouldn't suggest it. If you're not already
familiar with the website Meetup.com,
17

18
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:07,530
you should be, it's just spelled Meetup.com, check it out.
18

19
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:08,170
you should be, it's just spelled Meetup.com, check it out.
19

20
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:12,350
I'm pretty sure there wasn't a thing called
a meetup before that site existed.
20

21
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:17,610
At least, I'm assuming that's the case, because
I get a squiggly line underneath the word
21

22
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,720
every time I try to type it in.
22

23
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,780
Yes, I know what you're thinking.
23

24
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,600
And yes, I'm reading off a script.
24

25
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:27,560
Meetup.com is pretty much
what you're probably thinking it is.
25

26
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:33,220
It's a site for finding different groups or people who
physically meet up in person, or in internet speak,
26

27
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:39,550
IRL, as in AFK, BRB, TTYL, TGIF Fridays.
27

28
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:42,640
There are Meetup groups for just
about anything you can think of.
28

29
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:48,830
Like startups, music production, running groups,
book clubs, sports, and very, very specific hobbies.
29

30
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:52,770
Like, for instance, this group
I just found called "Chicks with Sticks."
30

31
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:57,630
I'm not sure where your mind goes when you hear
that name, but I'm willing to bet you didn't think of
31

32
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:00,910
a Meetup group for women who are hardcore into crotcheting.
32

33
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,670
I mean crocheting. Meetup is totally free and once
you sign up there's a search feature where you can
33

34
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:07,080
look for events near you.
34

35
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:13,260
Remember that guy who really was doing an awful job of selling
premium dog biscuits to his friend Dave that we covered earlier?
35

36
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,390
Remember that guy who really was doing an awful job of selling
premium dog biscuits to his friend Dave that we covered earlier?
36

37
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:20,400
Well, he should go on Meetup and look for dog related meetups
instead of pressuring Dave with a horribly written email.
37

38
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,360
Well, he should go on Meetup and look for dog related meetups
instead of pressuring Dave with a horribly written email.
38

39
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:27,180
I did a search for dogs within a 25 mile radius
of San Francisco, and well, there's a ton of them.
39

40
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,950
Dogs, not meetups.
40

41
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:29,530
Focus.
41

42
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:34,950
Like, for instance, this group - "Everyone
loves a Corgi in San Francisco" group.
42

43
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:42,070
Sure, except for the 1,408 members of
the "San Francisco French Bulldog Meetup."
43

44
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:44,010
I'm assuming they don't love Corgis.
44

45
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:49,080
There's even a "Startups + Dogs" meetup group
because... of course there is, it's San Francisco.
45

46
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:53,610
Another great site for finding events is Eventbrite,
which for all intents and purposes is really the
46

47
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:55,220
same thing as Meetup.
47

48
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:58,770
You can search for stuff within
a certain area, similar to Meetup,
48

49
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:04,530
although the stuff on Eventbrite tends to be more
like organized events where they're selling tickets.
49

50
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:09,270
I've even seen some Meetup groups that end up
selling tickets to their meetups on Eventbrite.
50

51
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:13,950
It'll probably take you a little bit longer to find your
people on Eventbrite, but it's worth checking out
51

52
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:19,650
and at least giving it a search, because you can filter
it down by the category really easily, and even by
52

53
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:23,010
the type of event if you know
you prefer one over the other.
53

54
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:28,200
OK, so go explore both Meetup and Eventbrite for
a little while and you're bound to find something
54

55
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:32,670
relevant to your business in some
area or city that's close enough.
55

56
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:36,510
Remember, you're not searching for events
within the same industry necessarily,
56

57
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:42,090
you're looking for groups of people that fit your target
customer category, that category we established
57

58
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:44,160
way back when in like, Section 2.
58

59
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:49,410
Now, I know the idea of going to an event and talking
to random strangers probably sounds absolutely
59

60
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:51,180
terrifying to a lot of you.
60

61
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:57,780
So we're going to talk a little bit and I'm going to give
you a couple ways to strike up conversations
61

62
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,300
at these events without really having to think about it.
62

63
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:05,040
It might be easier at something like a Corgi meetup,
since I'm guessing all they talk about is their
63

64
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:11,520
Corgis, but if you're going to, say, a business related
meetup, it's going to be a little bit different.
64

65
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:15,480
Corgi meetups are obviously just a little bit easier,
especially if you're selling dog biscuits, like
65

66
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,480
our misguided email master.
66

67
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:22,830
Really you just buy a Corgi obviously, and
you go to the meetups with said Corgi,
67

68
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:27,450
you hand out cards, and when you're done you don't
need the Corgi anymore, you just euthanize it and
68

69
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:32,400
then you probably at that point have gotten at least
10 customers. Networking events can feel forced
69

70
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,720
and awkward at times,
70

71
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:38,310
but the thing is, when you're at one of these events,
almost everyone is there to network as well.
71

72
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:44,280
So keep that in mind and it will make you actually feel quite
a bit less awkward, because everybody feels awkward.
72

73
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:44,980
So keep that in mind and it will make you actually feel quite
a bit less awkward, because everybody feels awkward.
73

74
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,840
Now, the game here at a meetup is really quite simple.
74

75
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:49,490
You all have a common interest.
75

76
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:54,980
Well, at least they do and don't yet realize
you're more like a wolf in sheep's clothing.
76

77
00:04:54,990 --> 00:05:00,420
They want to talk about their interests and we'll have
themed mini events that are based around the
77

78
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:07,110
same interests. Really all you have to do is make contact
with anyone and then ask them one of two automatic
78

79
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:09,150
things that pretty much always works.
79

80
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:11,100
Number one, "What do you do for a living?"
80

81
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,760
And number two, "What are you working on?"
81

82
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:20,310
Once you get that hook in their mouth, it's really
actually quite easy to navigate to the problem that
82

83
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:22,390
your business or product is trying to solve.
83

84
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:27,300
Once you get a little bit about how their day works
or what they do, it's completely normal to just ask
84

85
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:33,390
them either "Do you have the problem I'm trying to solve?"
or ask them if they can give you feedback on your project.
85

86
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:34,290
them either "Do you have the problem I'm trying to solve?"
or ask them if they can give you feedback on your project.
86

87
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:38,810
It's completely normal and completely relevant at
that point in the conversation. At this point, there
87

88
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:41,370
are just a couple of things you need to make sure you do.
88

89
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:47,400
I strongly suggest you have business cards or some sort
of way of getting people your contact information easily.
89

90
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,090
I strongly suggest you have business cards or some sort
of way of getting people your contact information easily.
90

91
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:54,120
When you exchange your information, that's by far
the easiest point at which you can then later contact
91

92
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:59,130
them and then try to introduce your product, if you
haven't. In person, they're not going to obviously
92

93
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:03,000
buy whatever you sell, but it's a
good opportunity to get feedback,
93

94
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:06,690
but then afterwards it's really easy to just follow up.
94

95
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:11,640
Remember, if you respond too early, they'll realize you're
desperate and they won't want to go on a candlelit 
95

96
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,660
dinner with you.
96

97
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:16,830
Now, when you do respond, just say "Hey, you showed interest
in my product. Here it is, before I forget to send it to you."
97

98
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:17,670
Now, when you do respond, just say "Hey, you showed interest
in my product. Here it is, before I forget to send it to you."
98

99
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:19,420
Now, when you do respond, just say "Hey, you showed interest
in my product. Here it is, before I forget to send it to you."
99

100
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,740
Then at the end of the email, you can ask for more feedback.
100

101
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,840
Then at the end of the email, you can ask for more feedback.
101

102
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,280
That's really it.
102

103
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:28,320
Find groups that correspond to who you're
trying to sell to on Meetup specifically,
103

104
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,410
then just go to one or two of these.
104

105
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:35,520
You can easily strike up a conversation where you
just try to bring up what they do or what they are
105

106
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,810
working on. From there,
106

107
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:42,390
it's pretty inevitable that you'll talk about your
project and if it's not going in that direction, you
107

108
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:44,870
can still just ask them. What do you ask them?
108

109
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:49,890
You just ask them if they can either give you feedback or whether
they experienced the same problem, it kind of makes sense.
109

110
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:50,570
You just ask them if they can either give you feedback or whether
they experienced the same problem, it kind of makes sense.
110

111
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:55,260
Now, one thing to keep in mind is that these groups 
regularly have presentations and group discussions.
111

112
00:06:55,350 --> 00:07:00,450
If you're smart and motivated enough, you can introduce
yourself through one of these and talk about
112

113
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:05,340
what you do. That makes it really a whole lot easier
to find the ones that actually might be interested
113

114
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,480
in what you're saying.
114

115
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,180
All right, so now you've got a few ideas.
115

116
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:10,640
If you're still stuck on it, just google around.
116

117
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:14,490
There are a ton of blog posts on networking
out there that should give you some ideas.
117

118
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:19,370
A lot of them are - and by a lot of them
I mean all of them - are garbage, pretty much,
118

119
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:20,020
A lot of them are - and by a lot of them
I mean all of them - are garbage, pretty much,
119

120
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:26,000
but if you sift through them, you can sometimes
find some pointers that are actually pretty helpful.
120

121
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:29,120
And if that doesn't work, head up to the Q&A section in our Slack.
121

122
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:34,030
OK, so if you're not still upset about that
Corgi joke, I will see you in the next lecture.
