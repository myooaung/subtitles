00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:01.830
All right guys welcome back.

2
00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:06.840
So now that we've used the last few lectures to better understand the him and paid advertising.

3
00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.330
I want to jump into Google afterwards and show you how to get started and how to set up a campaign of

4
00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:12.780
your own.

5
00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.570
Now spread this out over a group of lectures because honestly some of these details get really kind

6
00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:19.620
of in the weeds.

7
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.970
But I want to start by jumping into onwards and talking you through the first bunch of options.

8
00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.280
You'll need to consider focusing on the type of campaign you want to run right up to the point where

9
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.890
you start figuring out your bids and your budget.

10
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.090
All right so let's get started at the very beginning now.

11
00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.020
Log in to Google ad words or create an account if you haven't already.

12
00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.500
Through the easy add words dot Google dot com.

13
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.170
Don't worry I'll wait for you.

14
00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.860
Once you logged in you might see a big create your first campaign button and you might want to press

15
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:47.490
that thing.

16
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.310
But before you do let's just talk about a few things you need to think about before you actually click

17
00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:53.820
it.

18
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.440
First off you want to consider what you want out of your advertising efforts so start with a goal.

19
00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.910
Be specific about what you want to accomplish.

20
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.320
Do you want people to visit your website.

21
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.230
You want them to buy something on your website.

22
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.660
You want them to complete a form on your website.

23
00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.520
Do you just want them to visit your business in person.

24
00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.340
Or do you just want them to see an ad or promotion for something you offer in general.

25
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.490
Each campaign needs to be focused like on one product or one goal.

26
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.780
Don't increase sales of two different products like your let's say custom iPhone cases and light switch

27
00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:25.370
plates.

28
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.410
Well then you probably want to run two different campaigns.

29
00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:33.420
Same goes if you want to increase sales of your iPhone cases but also use ads to drive foot traffic

30
00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.450
to your new physical store.

31
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.340
If you have multiple goals values multiple campaigns.

32
00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.460
So what is your goal.

33
00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.100
Now Google has different campaign types for you to choose from.

34
00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:47.070
Choosing the right one depends on which customers you want to reach and how.

35
00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.590
For example you might want to target customers who are actively searching for a product or a solution

36
00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:53.850
to something.

37
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.980
If that matches the kind of campaign you want to run you probably want to run a search network campaign

38
00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.820
or you might want to do a campaign using Google's display network.

39
00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.520
Now there are millions of Web sites who have partnered with Google to show advertising on their site.

40
00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:14.630
Sometimes it's text sometimes it's images or graphics no issue ads from the display network hand.

41
00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.980
They could be text they can be banners like graphics or they could be video if you want to reach all

42
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.810
the potential customers on those Web sites display network campaign would be your choice.

43
00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.720
That's going to get you a lot of coverage.

44
00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:32.460
Now if you only do search engine results searches well then you're only going after people who have

45
00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.130
gone to Google and are searching for something where there is a third option.

46
00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.190
You can actually do both.

47
00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.420
There's an option to do campaigns for the search network with display network added in.

48
00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.660
And if you're really not sure which network is right for you it's probably easier just to pick both

49
00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.050
and then see if one performs better than the other.

50
00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:54.280
Usually it's the case that one will do a lot better for you know a few other types available as well.

51
00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:59.250
One specifically for advertising products you want to sell which they call a shopping campaign video

52
00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:05.200
only ads and a video campaign or promoting an app in what they call a universal app campaign.

53
00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.130
For now we're just going to focus on search and display just because we have to start somewhere.

54
00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:14.580
And when you choose your campaign type you also get to choose between standard and all features.

55
00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:19.320
Now standard is more straightforward and the simplest way to get an ad up and running when you're more

56
00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:25.860
comfortable with the platform you might explore than the features option to customize your ad and targeting

57
00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.120
and then do a whole lot of other advanced functions.

58
00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.710
For now I'm just going to go a standard from this point.

59
00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:33.390
My options are pretty straightforward.

60
00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.970
Under networks I'll keep both of them checked google search and Google Display for devices that says

61
00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:44.660
ads will show on all eligible devices by default so that's perfectly fine with me.

62
00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:49.950
We'll figure out my ad formats later on for locations I'm cool with us and Canada.

63
00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:53.810
Maybe you'd have you know different opinions on that one but I'm going to stick with this.

64
00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:58.710
Obviously if you sell an online like Digital good you could sell it anywhere.

65
00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.380
Doesn't matter what location you go after.

66
00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.220
But you might ownership's restrict yourself based on language.

67
00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:08.580
And speaking of language well I speak English and I expect my customers are probably going to also speak

68
00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:09.140
English.

69
00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.280
Now if you have different needs obviously just click on it and you'll see all the choices they've got.

70
00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.660
And unfortunately I don't speak any of those other languages.

71
00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:21.300
So if you don't speak English good luck watching these lectures Anyway anyway the next section here

72
00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:22.390
is bid strategy.

73
00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.950
And honestly the bidding stuff gets pretty detailed and takes a bit of explanation.

74
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.950
So let's save that for our next lecture shall we.

75
00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.570
All right guys I'll see you in the next lecture.
