00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:01,410
Our guys here we go.

2
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:05,580
Welcome back we're on to Step Three of our process of getting coverage for you and your product.

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:09,750
Now in our last two lectures we talked about finding and researching news reporter bloggers writers

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:14,560
and other people who will eventually write glowing pieces about how awesome you and your product are.

5
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:19,970
But before we get to that ultimate granddaddy conclusion we've got a little more work to do.

6
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:25,000
Now step three here is about getting the attention of journalists now that's the subject of this lecture

7
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:26,190
and it is quite tricky.

8
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:30,570
Now if you want to pitch yourself to someone it greatly helps that they know who you are.

9
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:40,230
Look at Justin Timberlake in Japan.

10
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:45,720
You don't have to be their best friend but a general awareness of your name is typically going to help

11
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:49,140
you out quite a bit according to a survey of editors at many big media outlets.

12
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:54,330
Sixty four percent said a personal connection with the person who pitched them was moderately or more

13
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:54,930
important.

14
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:59,280
So sure it's possible that you can approach people cold where they know nothing about you and hope that

15
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,350
your pitch is good enough.

16
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:05,010
And honestly if you don't have time to get to know these journalists maybe that's the way that you need

17
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:11,280
to approach this and instead focus on more people as opposed to fine tuning and kind of warming up to

18
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,140
a smaller batch.

19
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:13,050
That's perfectly fine.

20
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:18,000
That data said you know 64 percent moderately or more important it's not 100 percent required.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,170
All I'm saying is if you have the time to get on the radar before you actually need them to hear your

22
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:26,280
pitch and write it about you well it's going to really help you out.

23
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,870
So consider this as an optional step if you want but I strongly recommend it.

24
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:31,090
So how does this work.

25
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:35,820
Well once you know which reporters might help you out connect with them on social media and other platforms

26
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:40,770
are highly recommended in the last two steps that when you find some good leads for reporters and bloggers

27
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:43,680
and such that you immediately connect with their social media accounts.

28
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:47,740
Well this is why if you aren't following them already go do that now.

29
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:53,070
Once you're connected with these leads engage directly with them comment on their posts ask them questions

30
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:55,670
provide answers when and if they ask questions.

31
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:59,790
Some reporters turn on their followers on Twitter or Corra when they're looking for source material

32
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:02,480
for their articles and they'll just ask questions.

33
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:06,100
Look for these opportunities to chime in and get on the radar in general.

34
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:11,070
Just try to be helpful if they're talking about something and you think they're wrong.

35
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,700
It's information to show they're wrong.

36
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:18,360
Try to share that or try to bolster the opinion what they said or some article that they posted other

37
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:22,070
opportunities that might come up could be the things like webinars or Twitter chats.

38
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,450
Take a look through your list Twitter feeds and see if they actually participate on Twitter chats.

39
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:31,470
Now these are regular events where group chats for an hour or so using a hash tag and shares info and

40
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:32,700
answers many questions.

41
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:39,420
Maybe your reporter takes part in a small biz chat on Wednesday nights or Linked-In chat on Tuesday.

42
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:43,950
Now remember this is a tactic that can take time but try not to think of it as purely just a way to

43
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:44,580
get coverage.

44
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:45,620
Participate in these events.

45
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:46,950
You might actually learn something.

46
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:51,600
Network with people and get some tips from fellow app developers or startup peeps on how you get coverage

47
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,490
in your industry.

48
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:56,360
So connect on social media Gaige with them directly and look for them on chat.

49
00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:01,170
But during this process don't just limit yourself to your spreadsheet and the lists you came up with.

50
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:05,380
That list should evolve as you learn more about your reporters and other leads.

51
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:09,130
So if you can act and engage with people on your list you'll put yourself in a much better position.

52
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:13,200
The time comes actually approach from directly with a pitch when they recognize your name or even better

53
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,610
if they know you personally.

54
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:17,200
Chances are they're more likely to take into consideration.

55
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:21,150
All right keep those tips in mind that we move forward which we're going to do right now.

56
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:26,730
We also have a couple other lectures where I dive more into specific tactics for getting their attention

57
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:28,130
and engaging with them.

58
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:30,480
They're just the ones I want to spend a little bit more time on.

59
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,950
Thus they have their own lecture.

60
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:33,780
All right guys I'll see you in the next lecture.
