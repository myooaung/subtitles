1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,020
Hey guys welcome back to the chorus now.

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:03,300
All right.

3
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:08,970
Before we actually get into the actual tactics and implementation of a content strategy let's cover

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:15,540
something that you may or may not have been thinking about yourself now that is what is inbound marketing

5
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:20,370
Inbound Marketing It's a concept you guys might have heard about online.

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,470
It's usually used in conjunction with the term outbound marketing and it's something that marketers

7
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,610
generally have a pretty good grasp of.

8
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:30,920
Therefore it's something you should probably know.

9
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:35,580
Now if you already know what Inbound Marketing is you are welcome to skip the lecture Otherwise let's

10
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:36,860
move on.

11
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:41,710
Now I know you don't hate me for saying this but before we explain what Inbound Marketing is that helps

12
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:45,420
to explain what outbound marketing is first.

13
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,890
And here's a quick history lesson.

14
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:53,710
Fire up your flux capacitor or your Tardis or whatever you've got and set it for about 25 years ago.

15
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:55,910
Talking about like back in the 80s.

16
00:00:56,130 --> 00:01:03,330
If customers wanted to know what products were available back then they generally had to wait for television

17
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:10,800
commercials or radio ads or flyers or magazines or billboards or newspapers to tell them about said

18
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,910
products.

19
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:19,140
In those cases advertisers would come up with an ad push it out to the newspaper or the radio or the

20
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,970
TV channel which would then get disseminated outward towards the customers.

21
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:26,850
Hence why we call it outbound marketing.

22
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,390
These channels are generally older and most of them are still around.

23
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:35,330
Actually mentioned a couple of these when we talked about online channels.

24
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:40,140
We back in like Section 1 when we're talking about growth traction channels.

25
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:45,030
But I didn't cover these in detail because well if you've been paying attention they don't really work

26
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,830
as well as they used to.

27
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:50,770
That's all we focus on more of the modern marketing channels in this course.

28
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:56,610
Now what are the good parts about outbound marketing is that if your audience lives on these outbound

29
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:03,840
channels the most likely see or hear your ad if you're tuned into a radio station all day long chances

30
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,600
are you'll know about the special deal on Betamax tapes down at the music store.

31
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:09,300
Better hurry.

32
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:16,200
Everyone knows Betamax is going to be huge but the not so great part about the outbound marketing channel

33
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:24,210
is that relevant information your customer needs is largely not available at the exact moment that they

34
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:26,500
need it or are thinking about it.

35
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:33,510
You know I need to make some mix tapes where should I go to get some mix tapes I might wonder.

36
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:39,930
Not really me I'm not musically inclined but you might if the customer changes let's say channels or

37
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:44,600
they don't buy a newspaper that given day when they're actually thinking about this.

38
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:50,730
Well then they would miss out on your and you never make the connection from their need to your product.

39
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:56,310
So if you advertise through an outbound marketing channel there's a good chance that your customers

40
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:59,650
might just miss your ad.

41
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:04,290
You also in general with outbound marketing have to have a pretty good understanding of who your customers

42
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:09,300
are because when you make it and you design it and you put it out on the outbound channel you kind of

43
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:16,150
have to know exactly what demographic needs to see it and then place your ad correctly.

44
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:19,680
You know what else also is not so great about marketing.

45
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:21,900
You can't track any of it.

46
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:28,710
It's nearly impossible to know if you sold anything say based off of an ad you ran on the television

47
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:30,420
radio or a magazine.

48
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:35,550
Sure some people get around this by saying like use a reference code or use a coupon code when you come

49
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:36,510
to our Web site.

50
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:41,400
But that actually lowers your conversion rate and it's just largely inefficient.

51
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:43,250
All right now the history lesson is over.

52
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:46,620
Get back in your Delorean and come back to the present day.

53
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:52,140
Don't worry all of the things we were worried about in the 80s are completely solved pollution solve

54
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:55,770
energy independence totally solved traffic.

55
00:03:55,950 --> 00:04:00,540
Oh yeah completely solved because today in 2017 we all write segues.

56
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:06,630
Now we all live in a world with the Internet mobile devices and more importantly Amazon Prime.

57
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,640
Everything is awesome today.

58
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:14,700
If we have a need as opposed to the poor caveman in the 80s we're not going to wait for a TV commercial

59
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:17,990
or something in the mail to tell us how to fix the problem.

60
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:23,370
We have the enter webs and the means to find tons of information about the products or services that

61
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:24,760
were in the market for.

62
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:27,630
So what's a poor outbound marketer to do.

63
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:33,370
Well marketing adapts and one of the biggest adaptations and trends you need to understand.

64
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,480
Yes actually make sure to learn this.

65
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,250
Pay attention.

66
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:38,630
Eric you in the back of the class.

67
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,650
I know you never pay attention.

68
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:44,080
You need to understand that concept of inbound marketing.

69
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:47,850
Now if you're listening carefully or talking about outbound marketing and you know that advertisers

70
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,310
push information out about bell marking he probably guess what.

71
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:55,520
Inbound Marketing is and we talk about Inbound Marketing we're referring to channels like blog post

72
00:04:55,590 --> 00:05:02,760
social media updates videos emails or really kind of the more modern stuff that we interact with on

73
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:09,960
a daily basis when we see those newer forms of marketing the kind of the end goal of those is to drive

74
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:16,860
someone to go to a page or to look up something else that basically leads them somewhere where you can

75
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:19,590
capture their email or you try to sell them something.

76
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:26,310
The end result is that the customers instead seek you out and they're coming from your reference point

77
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:27,860
as if they're inbound.

78
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,650
You push it out there kind of phishing for people.

79
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:33,470
They find the information they want when they want to.

80
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:38,400
And that leads them back to you know in order to be effective and on top of your game you need to produce

81
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:44,700
content that is less about advertising and more about providing value your content has to be less about

82
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:51,120
pushing out information on people and more about earning their trust by showing them you can be useful

83
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:51,870
to them.

84
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:57,450
Think about it if you're considering buying a new product or trying something you've never done before.

85
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,350
What steps would you would you actually take first.

86
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,010
Most people would do a search online.

87
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:09,270
We would use search queries that make sense to us like we would search for how to put up Christmas lights

88
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:14,700
if you're trying to put up Christmas lights who's playing in the Super Bowl what is the Super Bowl.

89
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,410
Is Tom Brady really Jon Benet Ramsey.

90
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:18,810
You know stuff like that.

91
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:24,540
So if you're the one selling Super Bowl outfits or selling Christmas lights What do you need to put

92
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:25,690
on your page.

93
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:31,200
How give you a hint if you want to master inbound marketing you need to go a whole lot further than

94
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:35,140
just your product name price and some basic description.

95
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:40,440
Inbound Marketing channels include things like blogs where you can blog about the best ways to prepare

96
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:45,900
and set up Christmas light displays and oh yeah you sell you know lights and equipment one might need

97
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:46,670
to do it.

98
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:50,990
Inbound Marketing encompasses anything you put up casually for someone to find.

99
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,780
It could be a blog your actual website.

100
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:57,060
It can be a post you put on someone else's web site.

101
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,510
It can be a resource document you share.

102
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:04,590
It could be tips and suggestions you post on your social media platforms.

103
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:12,070
Anything that's not being pushy but instead just offers itself up as useful to whoever can find it.

104
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:13,440
Now are you noticing a pattern.

105
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,500
What I'm describing.

106
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:19,410
It's not just that the outbound ways of marketing of here's what we sell now buy it.

107
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:21,640
It's the in-bound way of marketing.

108
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:27,060
Here is how our products have helped customers like yourself and if you want to buy it well you can

109
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:27,900
help yourself.

110
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:33,480
But wait you might be asking yourself if those outbound channels are so inferior why are they still

111
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,530
around.

112
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:41,850
Well because while they are less efficient in many regards they can still work and often you know big

113
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:47,430
businesses have already built their marketing teams around them and while there's really no greater

114
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:52,530
force in the universe than inertia for businesses just starting up in-bounds strategies are quicker

115
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:55,170
they're easier and they're much cheaper.

116
00:07:55,200 --> 00:08:00,670
And as I've said before you'll get better results in general more bang for your buck.

117
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,030
All right.

118
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:02,220
So we got it.

119
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:09,090
Outbound is the O.G. of advertising and is used to describe ads strategies that broadcast messages out

120
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:14,200
to potential customers without the customers doing really anything themselves.

121
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:19,260
In men on the other hand any marketing that's designed to satisfy a need your customer has and then

122
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:22,690
connect them while they are actively looking for it.

123
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:25,920
And oh yeah you nudge them to then buy your stuff.

124
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,500
Get it.

125
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:27,030
All right.

126
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,230
Moving on to the next lecture.
