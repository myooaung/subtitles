00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.790
They have room and welcome to the SBO section of our course first section and get your a thousand in

2
00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.140
the next couple sections.

3
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.720
We're going to talk about how you've gone from those medium reward.

4
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.740
Medium time investment strategies like getting press making a content strategy putting together some

5
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:17.450
videos.

6
00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:22.170
Now can you transition into the truly long term growth channels.

7
00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.090
The ones that can get you thousands even millions of customers.

8
00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.940
Ever you're just not going to see results in the first month two months three months even.

9
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:37.260
These are the ones that you kind of take for the road and they can really carry your business.

10
00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.280
So we're going to start off with SEO Search Engine Optimization.

11
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:46.590
Now the business and marketing world is perhaps the most famous of all the acronyms out there behind

12
00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:53.290
maybe RTFM or low ASIO's I just said before stands for Search Engine Optimization.

13
00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:58.920
And the reason why ASIO's so important for building your customer base is that SCA is all about getting

14
00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.710
you and your Web site found.

15
00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.100
If people can't find you well then they're less likely to read your content share your pages and become

16
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.820
a customer.

17
00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.220
Now you can take a wild guess and say what you think the most popular Web site in the world is and you'd

18
00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.750
be right if you said Google almost every single time zone opens up a browser.

19
00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:16.630
What do they do.

20
00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.630
They usually will go to Google and then search for something.

21
00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.650
So being able to be visible within that directory that base that directory that basically acts like

22
00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.730
business God is going to be incredibly important.

23
00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.330
So what is it.

24
00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.860
Well it's a set of guidelines and best practices you can use when you create and publish pages of content.

25
00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:40.050
Its purpose is to make it easier for Google and your audience out there to better understand and find

26
00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:41.790
the value in what you posted online.

27
00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.120
Specifically I'm talking about ways to structure and write your articles.

28
00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.900
Web site pages and blog post.

29
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.930
I'm also talking about putting the right information inside the HTML code and tags in your pages.

30
00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.160
So Google has a better chance at finding and understanding what you've got.

31
00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.000
And I'm also talking about ways to get other people to link to you because of the content you create

32
00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.780
and the ways you share and promote your pages.

33
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:09.860
And I'm also talking about how you can reverse engineer CEO to plan your content strategy.

34
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:15.360
You can figure out what's prime for the taking use some keyword research to inform your decision making

35
00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.610
and then make content you know will rank.

36
00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.030
Not all of these efforts are done right on the pages you create.

37
00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.270
Some of these efforts happen off the page as well.

38
00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:28.740
Really it is about words it's about code it's about outreach through research and practice you'll discover

39
00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.990
how to use the best of all three of those things.

40
00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:35.610
The best words the best code and the best kind of outreach to get the results you want and grow your

41
00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:36.150
audience.

42
00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.150
