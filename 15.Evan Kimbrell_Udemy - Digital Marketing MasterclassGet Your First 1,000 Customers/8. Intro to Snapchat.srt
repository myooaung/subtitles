1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:02,270
Hey guys welcome back to the cause.

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:03,090
It's our last lecture.

3
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:07,770
I mentioned that Snapchat and Instagram are emerging platforms for marketing opportunities.

4
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:09,780
Well in this lecture let's talk about Snapchat.

5
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:12,210
Now Snapchat begins with a very common concept.

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,160
Sharing pictures or videos with a friend or a group of friends.

7
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:20,190
But the big difference here with Snapchat is that when you post something after a certain amount of

8
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:22,040
time it disappears.

9
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:29,310
The idea is that it makes the post ephemeral which makes it more attractive more raw and more genuine.

10
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:33,210
It also entices people to share things that they wouldn't want posted publicly forever.

11
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,890
So while most platforms come with that assumption that your data and your content will be safe forever.

12
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:41,160
Snapchat like No let's just delete it immediately.

13
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:45,660
Now this point I have to say guys if you know how Snapchat works and you use it and you're an active

14
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:49,020
user skip this lecture because I don't want to hear you complain about it.

15
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:50,610
I don't even know what I'm doing here.

16
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:51,590
We're wasting our time.

17
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,270
But if you haven't.

18
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:55,050
Well we can continue along.

19
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:56,010
Now let's look at the data.

20
00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:02,190
Two thirds of Snapchat users are under 25 and according to research these younger users really embrace

21
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:07,160
this idea that you post whatever you want but know that it will actually be gone soon enough Snapchat

22
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:11,980
is a platform that encourages spontaneity looking into the past doesn't matter on this platform.

23
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,460
It's really all about what's happening right this second.

24
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:20,910
And to add to that when you post your snaps or the pictures you put on Snapchat you can apply fun filters

25
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:22,860
and effects to the photos themselves.

26
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:27,080
So the vibe on Snapchat is generally going to be casual and fun.

27
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:31,200
You don't see a lot of high production stuff because it's spontaneous.

28
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,140
The whole point is you didn't have a lot of time to prep.

29
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,920
So Snapchat now supports something like one hundred and fifty million users daily.

30
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,410
But how exactly Snapchat an opportunity.

31
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:44,400
Well with a platform where pictures disappear how exactly can you create a lasting presence.

32
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:48,750
Well this is what our group of lectures coming up now will explore in our next lecture.

33
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:52,910
Will start by creating a Snapchat account for your business and then we'll run through a few tactics

34
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,190
you can try to create some awareness of your brand and then grow your audience.

35
00:01:56,190 --> 00:02:01,050
Now before we do that though let me run down some of the lingo you'll hear when we discuss what you

36
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:02,070
can do on Snapchat.

37
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:03,360
The first one is snap.

38
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:03,740
OK.

39
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:08,190
Well Snapchat when you send a picture or a video that's just called a snap.

40
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,410
The next thing is a story.

41
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:14,960
And this is relatively new defense when you guys are watching this but it's a collection of snaps.

42
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:16,320
You can share with followers.

43
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,540
Now instead of sharing one picture you actually can share a whole bunch.

44
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,720
And it's both of them lasting like 90 seconds or nine to 15 seconds are thinking actually are shorter

45
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,630
like six to 15 these last 24 hours.

46
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:29,220
Next thing is live and why.

47
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:33,510
Well it's just a variation of that story where you can see the world through someone else's Snapchat

48
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,010
right this second.

49
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:39,210
Then we have things like filters now filters are overlays for your snaps allow you to decorate your

50
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:44,670
pictures with text graphics and by applying color and contrast effects all sorts of special filters

51
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:49,230
that can only be unlocked if you like say go to a specific location.

52
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:52,710
Those are also called like geo filters then you filters that unlock.

53
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:58,620
The more you use it they also have the special filters that transform your face into a dog or a panda

54
00:02:58,620 --> 00:02:59,980
or something like that.

55
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,660
Those are fun for Friend to friend but as a business while you kind of be careful with that stuff.

56
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:05,950
And that brings me to that term.

57
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,470
It's actually called a lens.

58
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:12,330
So when you're trying to take a photo of your face if you tap the screen while you're doing that it

59
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:14,270
brings up your available lenses.

60
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,600
And that's where you have the opportunity to look like a panda or a dog or whatever you have activated

61
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:20,760
the next thing worth doing is the snap code.

62
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,860
And this is essentially a profile badge including your photo.

63
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:26,670
That's scalable by other Snapchat users.

64
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,610
This can be very useful in building your brand.

65
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:30,660
More on that later.

66
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:35,040
The next term worth exploring is discover that's just a snap a section on Snapchat that's designed for

67
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,300
brands and publishers.

68
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:39,300
They're able to share stories there to larger audiences.

69
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:43,470
But this is things like you know ESPN or Cosmo or BuzzFeed.

70
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:45,870
People have direct relationships with the company.

71
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:49,740
So once you jump into Snapchat with your own account you'll get familiar with some of these terms very

72
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:50,280
quickly.

73
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,380
But your first step is to create an account.

74
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:54,100
So we're going to do that the next lecture.

75
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:54,510
See you then.
