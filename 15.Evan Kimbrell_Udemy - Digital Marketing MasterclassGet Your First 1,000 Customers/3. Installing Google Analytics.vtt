Hey guys, welcome back to the course. In this lecture,
1

2
00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.370
we're going to get you set up and understanding 
Google Analytics so you can get it on your site and you
2

3
00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.100
can start stalking your customers the proper way.
3

4
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.330
As I mentioned earlier, Google Analytics is 
the wheat bread of analytics platforms.
4

5
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:16.250
It's free,
5

6
00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.860
we've established that we're cheapskates, 
and it's also quite powerful.
6

7
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.670
So you get a lot of bang for your nonexistent buck.
7

8
00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.080
Most importantly though, it's going to help you figure 
out where people are coming from and then what
8

9
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.310
they're looking at when they get to 
your site - this is crucial information.
9

10
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.430
So let's check it out and see what it looks like.
10

11
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.950
After that we'll take a look at some of the data from 
my projects and get you familiar with what's what.
11

12
00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:39.800
If you already have it installed on your site,
12

13
00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:46.500
feel free to skip to the next lecture or blast through this
one at 2x speed, so I sound kind of like a chipmunk.
13

14
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.300
feel free to skip to the next lecture or blast through this
one at 2x speed, so I sound kind of like a chipmunk.
14

15
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:55.420
For this demo, I'm assuming you have a Google account 
already, you know, use Gmail or any of the Google products,
15

16
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.400
For this demo, I'm assuming you have a Google account 
already, you know, use Gmail or any of the Google products,
16

17
00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.420
but if you don't, I mean, you can create it in 10 seconds.
Anyway, to start this journey, go to analytics.google.com.
17

18
00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.690
but if you don't, I mean, you can create it in 10 seconds.
Anyway, to start this journey, go to analytics.google.com.
18

19
00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.540
Here's what it looks like when you're starting from scratch.
19

20
00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:05.540
Hey, look at that.
20

21
00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.150
Google basically spells out exactly 
what we're going to do in three steps.
21

22
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.150
First we're going to sign up for Google Analytics,
22

23
00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.850
we're going to add our tracking code to our website, 
and then we're going to learn more about our audience.
23

24
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.120
Anyway, so click Sign Up.
24

25
00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.010
Let's say I'm looking to learn about 
the traffic I've been receiving to
25

26
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.950
my new site. It's called, I don't know, 
we'll call it Carl's Creampuffs.
26

27
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.700
So I'll put that in here for the account name.
27

28
00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:29.980
I'll just put in the same thing under website name.
28

29
00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.890
Nobody will see these except for you, so just put 
in something that makes sense for your project.
29

30
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.840
And, of course, the website URL is going to be 
carlscreampuffs.com. If that's secretly slang for
30

31
00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:40.840
something bad, I don't want to know.
31

32
00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.030
something bad, I don't want to know.
32

33
00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.610
Now, select an industry category.
33

34
00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.050
There's a list of a bunch of different industries in here.
34

35
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.100
Just pick what makes sense for your business.
35

36
00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.950
I'm going to select beauty and fitness, because everybody 
knows consuming cream puffs on a regular basis
36

37
00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.390
will make you look amazing.
37

38
00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.980
You can select whatever time zone you're in obviously.
38

39
00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.740
Otherwise, we're just going to leave the rest of the 
options selected as they recommend and then click
39

40
00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.780
"Get Tracking ID" here at the bottom.
40

41
00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.630
See? It really doesn't take long at all.
41

42
00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.110
And, of course, we don't actually read the Terms of 
Service and we just blindly hit "I accept," which most
42

43
00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.260
likely means I've signed away my first born child - whatever.
43

44
00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.430
OK.
44

45
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.210
Now you should see that Google gives you a little pop-up
which points out our new tracking ID number
45

46
00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.270
and says we need to install it on our website.
46

47
00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.690
We'll do that here in a second.
47

48
00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.350
Scroll down just a bit and see this 
section about website tracking.
48

49
00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:33.270
This is where the code snippet is that we'll use on our 
site. Just highlight this little bit of code and then copy it.
49

50
00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:34.280
This is where the code snippet is that we'll use on our 
site. Just highlight this little bit of code and then copy it.
50

51
00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.080
And that's literally all we have to do for this first step.
51

52
00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.430
I like to take that code we just copied and paste it
into a doc somewhere just so I don't have to come
52

53
00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:47.720
back and then find it again if I end up getting distracted 
or go back to watching my cat video or whatever.
53

54
00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.560
If you have a custom website that you yourself have 
complete access to, well, you need to put this code
54

55
00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.420
in what's called the header section of each page that you want to 
track on your website. The header section is pretty easy to find,
55

56
00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:58.220
in what's called the header section of each page that you want to 
track on your website. The header section is pretty easy to find,
56

57
00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:04.680
it's going to be in the alligator brackets and it 
says "head". It's usually one of the first things
57

58
00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.940
you see in your page code.
58

59
00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.320
You don't have to be a programmer 
to know how to do this.
59

60
00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.380
You just have to be able to identify that text 
and throw this somewhere in the middle.
60

61
00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.920
Now, if you own a physical store, it's a little bit different.
61

62
00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.940
You make sure that you take the code, you write it out, 
and then you post it in the entry way when people walk in.
62

63
00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:21.650
You make sure that you take the code, you write it out, 
and then you post it in the entry way when people walk in.
63

64
00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.130
All right, now I will take that code 
snippet and plug it into my website.
64

65
00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.610
I'm going to show you how to do it in 
WordPress, since something like 27% of
65

66
00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:34.950
the internet is made up of WordPress sites. But other 
platforms like SquareSpace and Wix will work similarly,
66

67
00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.760
and they also have pretty much
the same process to get to this.
67

68
00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.550
They make it very easy to do this, because 
everybody does this at some point.
68

69
00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:45.300
If you want to do this manually 
yourself, because you're a doer,
69

70
00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:50.430
well, then just open up the index file for each of your web pages 
and then just look for those brackets where it says "head".
70

71
00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:51.360
well, then just open up the index file for each of your web pages 
and then just look for those brackets where it says "head".
71

72
00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:57.120
Drop it somewhere in there so it's not breaking up any 
of the other script snippets you might already have.
72

73
00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.820
Drop it somewhere in there so it's not breaking up any 
of the other script snippets you might already have.
73

74
00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.010
Now, you can just stick it at the very beginning 
or at the very end just to be safe.
74

75
00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.660
Okay, so many WordPress themes will 
have a section for Google Analytics.
75

76
00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:06.500
I happen to be using one that doesn't.
76

77
00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:07.290
Yay for me.
77

78
00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:11.310
That's no problem though, because you can just 
download the simple WordPress plugin with a
78

79
00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.840
ridiculously obvious name. It's called 
"Insert Headers and Footers."
79

80
00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:20.040
As I mentioned a second ago, we'll need to insert that 
code snippet into the header section and this plugin
80

81
00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:25.230
will do the hard work of adding it to every page of 
your site automatically, including any new pages
81

82
00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:26.520
you had in the future.
82

83
00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.500
So we go to Settings and then click
on Insert Headers and Footers.
83

84
00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:35.520
Now we're going to paste in the copied code snippet
into the scripts in the header section. So right
84

85
00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.440
click, paste, and there you go.
85

86
00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.860
Now just click Save and we are good to go.
86

87
00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:44.850
That is literally all there is to setting it up, really 
shouldn't take you more than 15 minutes, and
87

88
00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:48.000
that's only if you get distracted 
halfway through the process.
88

89
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.260
Now, in the next lecture I'll show you how to dig 
into the data and learn more about your visitors
89

90
00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:53.430
once they start rolling in.
90

91
00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.990
See you then.
