WEBVTT
1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.720
All right we are back.

2
00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.870
We've been talking about editing in the last few lectures and even about outsourcing this task.

3
00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.950
For those of you who want to go that route.

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.780
But if you are doing the editing on your own First I applaud your dedication.

5
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.470
It's really not that bad though.

6
00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.430
What can be a little tough though is figuring out a style for the editing work you're doing.

7
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.290
I always look for inspiration from others to see what works what I like what I don't like and what I

8
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:26.380
can share with you guys.

9
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.760
And this is one of those examples right now.

10
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.290
There are lots out there.

11
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.650
But for your purposes and especially the marketing video type projects you'll be producing.

12
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.430
I have to mention the work of probably heard of them.

13
00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:43.410
Casey Neistat this will be the first example of editing styles that were going to break down and actually

14
00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.050
kind of look at now there are a lot of self-proclaimed YouTube stars out there but Casey knows that

15
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:55.950
is actually a man is probably the most qualified to claim that Casey is a New York based filmmaker has

16
00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.540
gained a lot of attention for the videos he's made over the past two years as part of his v log.

17
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.220
The log is just a dumb word that means video blog.

18
00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:08.820
Now most of his videos follow his daily life in New York but some of his most popular videos were Casey's

19
00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:15.960
attempt to take on brands like Apple over a defective iPod batteries or protecting bicyclists from dumb

20
00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:16.930
laws in New York City.

21
00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.290
Now these days he directs commercials for big brands like Nike Google Samsung and so on and so on.

22
00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:28.260
He also gets pretty massive endorsement deals just for opening things up in a box on his YouTube channel.

23
00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:34.320
Now part of kisi success comes from his unique filmmaking style a kind of frantic stream of consciousness

24
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.780
guerrilla way of filmmaking.

25
00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.950
A lot of the shots are handheld like holding the camera in the palm of his hand and like shooting it

26
00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:42.630
downward at him.

27
00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.240
But it's really his editing style.

28
00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.050
I want to talk about here in this lecture and it's really what I think is unique none of the tactics

29
00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.910
he uses in his videos that I want to highlight here.

30
00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:57.280
Now a lot of people might say that these techniques are technically wrong or go against classic filmmaking

31
00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:03.060
best practices but really they're just stylistic choices with the nature of YouTube and the evolution

32
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.610
of video.

33
00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.310
I think they're really effective.

34
00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:11.460
So first Casey uses big bold titles when Casey uses titles he fills up the entire screen.

35
00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:16.580
Well almost from one side of the frame to the other it's bold to the point of being obnoxious.

36
00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.840
But he does a few other things.

37
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.040
He uses a basic fault with no effects at it.

38
00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.250
No drop shadows or effects to separate the text from the video image just plain old text and the biggest

39
00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.250
size possible in the past.

40
00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.180
Filmmakers might position titles in a strategic spot like offer the side or near the bottom and they

41
00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.280
would definitely make them much much smaller.

42
00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.670
So whereas many others would think let's not overpower the image with these words on the screen.

43
00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.590
Casey instead uses titles to grab attention and set the stage for what's next.

44
00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:51.990
You also notice that with his introductions he often uses time lapses with that text superimposed on

45
00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.530
top of it.

46
00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:58.030
You'll notice that timelapse is a very common thing that he puts into his shots.

47
00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:03.150
Now by the way Casey sometimes uses homemade handwritten titles they're different and fun and keep the

48
00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.250
viewer within the scene they're watching.

49
00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.090
So when you want to do titles consider these different ways to do them.

50
00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:13.950
Templates are convenient but they usually stick to straight for best practice type styles so you may

51
00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.660
not find the Caseys tile in there.

52
00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:22.290
Doesn't necessarily mean you couldn't try though if you guys watched my running a web development business

53
00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.980
course.

54
00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:28.710
I actually used a very similar introduction style with the big text and I used blurred backgrounds instead

55
00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:30.130
of timelapse.

56
00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:31.530
But that was the inspiration.

57
00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:36.900
Now the next Casey ism is the use of fast pacing now pacing or First the speed at which the story is

58
00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:37.640
told.

59
00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:42.300
Casinos as interesting as his videos are people really aren't gonna stick around for an hour to see

60
00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:43.100
what happens.

61
00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.200
So in the span of five to ten minutes he'll tell his story.

62
00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.660
Keep things moving and get to his point or conclusion in a very timely fashion.

63
00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.990
Now you may discover that what you wrote in your script reads really well but when you're sitting there

64
00:03:54.990 --> 00:04:00.030
watching a video version you're bored or you already know where it's going so quick in the pace.

65
00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.590
Instead of using someone's words to tell a story it showed at the same time combine multiple images

66
00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:05.570
with dialogue.

67
00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:09.510
You get to use a split screen show multiple items or parts of a process.

68
00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:13.010
No another technique used to quicken the pace is to use time lapse video.

69
00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:17.880
It was kind of mentioned before but time does show the passage of time letting you know forward progress

70
00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.950
is being made and they look pretty cool.

71
00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:24.900
They're not so hard to make but you could also just check out again I stock photo or whatever although

72
00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:30.210
there's no way in hell he would use stock videos for his time lapses.

73
00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:34.520
That's part of what's cool about it is he actually uses his own stuff and you can tell if he went outside

74
00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:39.040
our camera did it twice in a day and that's what he used for his daily villagey.

75
00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:44.220
Also in his situation he does time lapses but then he doesn't do voiceover narration.

76
00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.320
I did this and I did this and he did this.

77
00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:51.840
He just has music playing in the background of every single episode and then he increases the volume

78
00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:52.890
during the time lapses

79
00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:07.500
OK the next Casey editing technique would probably make editing instructors at film schools everywhere

80
00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:13.550
roll over in their graves if they were dead of course Casey uses mini jump cuts in his videos.

81
00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.530
Now first question what exactly is a jump cut.

82
00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:22.490
Well a jump cut is an edit and a video where you can see a segment of video is missing like here is

83
00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:24.050
an example about this helmet.

84
00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.980
I think I showed you before that a stop light from the front of the helmet.

85
00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:28.760
That way people know to get the hell out of my way.

86
00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:34.100
I also saw the flashlight in the back of the helmet so cars coming up from behind know that it's me.

87
00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:37.740
But I just yesterday installed this here emergency whistle.

88
00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:40.490
The velcro with a rope on the side of the helmet.

89
00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:48.210
So now when I ride I just keep this little bastard right here I'm out like now we are cross again.

90
00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:49.920
That is what I'm talking about.

91
00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:54.640
Is this something you would almost never see in a professional movie or TV show.

92
00:05:54.650 --> 00:06:00.290
These are videos that are expected to be smooth and people will go out of their way to make sure that

93
00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:07.310
any time they go from saying something to saying something that there is no actual change in between.

94
00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:11.720
They try to make it as smooth as possible and that's why so many people use multiple cameras because

95
00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.460
they really don't want to put a jump cut.

96
00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:19.040
Now videos are supposed to be smooth and in traditional sense jump cuts are actually seen as many by

97
00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:25.340
as mistakes but to avoid jump cuts while you kind of have to go really out of your way to fix it.

98
00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:29.480
So Casey you just shoot with one camera and he doesn't have a huge crew full of people to help him.

99
00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:32.250
So there's no additional video coverage to help him at it.

100
00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:37.970
However Casey doesn't want to make seamlessly Polish videos he wants to tell stories he wants to communicate

101
00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:38.890
a thought or an idea.

102
00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:42.020
And to him that's more important than making an ad it looks seamless.

103
00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:44.390
Sometimes you don't even finish a sentence before cutting.

104
00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:48.190
If you already know basically what he's going to say he'll just cut and move things along.

105
00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:51.480
So Casey embraces these jump cuts as a way speed up the pace of his videos.

106
00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:57.020
Now you'll notice in my videos when we transition we use a little bit of a fade.

107
00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:00.210
I'm switching from paragraph to paragraph.

108
00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.270
I'm not going to just and then move to the next thing.

109
00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:07.250
We have a little bit of a Polish to it and that's just generally something that has more to do with

110
00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:08.760
educational content.

111
00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:13.280
However you will notice this just on YouTube it is very popular on YouTube to not put any transition

112
00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:16.850
and to just cut your words together as close as possible.

113
00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:21.290
Do you ever watch the villagey brothers again we are friends crash course they do that very similarly

114
00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:25.310
they'll cut these words together really really quickly there's no pauses in between their sentences

115
00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:30.870
happening I think is making his triumphant temporary return to our brothers.

116
00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:31.350
Hello.

117
00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:31.790
Hello.

118
00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:32.510
You're so bad.

119
00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:33.630
Paternity leave.

120
00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:36.190
Well that does is it forces you to pay attention.

121
00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:40.390
It forces you to listen to the actual words so you don't miss what's going on.

122
00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:46.280
That extra work you have to do is really what makes you engage with it a little bit more so Polish be

123
00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:49.220
damned if it's stylish and it keeps people engaged.

124
00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:52.840
Well that explains why so many people on YouTube use this style.

125
00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:56.900
So you might think How do I incorporate this technique in a video that are supposed to be professional

126
00:07:56.930 --> 00:08:00.830
and seamless and perfect jump cuts don't necessarily represent mistakes.

127
00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:04.930
Clearly if you leave the jump cut in a video you're doing it on purpose.

128
00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:09.410
It's really more about attitude using jump cuts means you want to show you have a different style you're

129
00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:12.030
not conservative you're not bound by the rules.

130
00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:16.450
It sounds like you and your brand or your business maybe you'll use more jump cuts and not worry about

131
00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:17.980
smooth and seamless editing.

132
00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:19.610
That's entirely up to you.

133
00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:23.010
I honestly suggest testing it out and see how people respond.

134
00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:29.300
Now related to jump cuts Casey also uses quick montages in his videos with a lot of uncommon shots.

135
00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:34.190
Many people have seen montages so they know when they're watching one and it'll either show the passage

136
00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:36.160
of time or the progression of a project.

137
00:08:36.170 --> 00:08:39.290
Building something working out.

138
00:08:39.290 --> 00:08:41.550
Rummaging around his office etc..

139
00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:45.800
Now Casey's montages are cut very quickly making the montages faster than normal.

140
00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:48.480
Maybe even a bit frantic a bit manic.

141
00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:53.930
Also includes mistakes or shots you wouldn't normally include like a camera getting bumped or another

142
00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:54.820
jump cut.

143
00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:58.620
Or saying the wrong thing screwing up a word etc..

144
00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:02.370
What it does is it adds a little bit of realism to the videos.

145
00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:06.930
And if you're not expecting that to happen and it happens they show it to you and they immediately quit.

146
00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:08.130
Cut to something else.

147
00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:11.050
Well that's actually something that keeps your attention.

148
00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:15.920
And this last point I think is an underlying current of a lot of Casey's video's realism.

149
00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:20.090
His videos are edited to show real life and real people saying and doing real things.

150
00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:21.290
Not like the real world.

151
00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:22.210
You know what I mean.

152
00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:27.830
Casey doesn't use a lot of effects in his videos other than the time lapse shots just superimposed text.

153
00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:32.960
Some filmmakers try to create videos that magically look seamless and refined through editing his editing

154
00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:37.450
style however embraces a lot of what other people actually edit out the mistakes.

155
00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:42.250
The funny parts the weird stuff the everyday things that happen that are worth noticing.

156
00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:47.060
Ultimately editing is about making choices you choose which pieces you keep and which ones you remove

157
00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:50.650
what you keep and your video will say a lot about who you are.

158
00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:56.230
So how or why would you use this type of editing software your own marketing videos.

159
00:09:56.270 --> 00:10:00.860
If you're interested in capturing and sharing some of that realism in your business well this is a style

160
00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:04.820
you could use Casey's video always have a point or a story to tell.

161
00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:08.870
But it's how he shows and tells that story that captures your attention.

162
00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:12.630
What stories could you tell in his handheld quick cuts.

163
00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:18.560
Manic constantly full of time lapses and little bits of realism thrown in there type style.

164
00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:20.270
Maybe you want to show how your product is made.

165
00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:22.040
Or take a trip through your office.

166
00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:27.690
These ideas aren't necessarily new ones but the way you shoot and edit your videos could be that newness

167
00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:33.020
could actually result in a larger than usual response from your audience.

168
00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:36.420
Now this style isn't best for everything kind of obvious.

169
00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:41.480
If you're unpacking a lot of information in a walkthrough for instance that frantic cut cut cut style

170
00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:46.730
might actually be kind of hard to follow but a two to three minute explainer video might give you a

171
00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:47.810
chance to experiment.

172
00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:48.530
All right so there you go.

173
00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:53.090
That's the Casey Neistat style of editing broken down and analyzed.

174
00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:56.370
Now watch this channel on YouTube and you'll see what we're talking about here.

175
00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:59.020
I generally say look at the way he does it.

176
00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:01.620
It's very grungy it's very guerrilla.

177
00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:02.450
It's very.

178
00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:03.650
Just get things done.

179
00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:09.020
If you are making a video where you're trying to project a brand or a life style image or something

180
00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:14.330
a little more creative or behind the scenes definitely take a look at how he shoots things and these

181
00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:17.460
are things you can easily copy jump cuts are really easy.

182
00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:20.300
You have a sense and you have a sense and a period in between.

183
00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:24.530
You're not saying anything well cut out that period and put those two sentences as close together as

184
00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:25.130
possible.

185
00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:29.840
Do not use a transition putting a time lapse Well that's just you just have to plan for where in the

186
00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:32.110
story or where in the script it's going to go.

187
00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:34.240
Montage is really the same thing.

188
00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:39.480
And then if you want to put in realism and bloopers and defects and things like that well you really

189
00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:41.880
just want to keep the camera rolling as much as possible.

190
00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:48.560
And then before you do your rough cut scrubs through the video and look for opportunities where something

191
00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:53.000
different might have happened somewhere or someone said something weird or people start laughing because

192
00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.550
you went off script or just anything you dropped something you'll notice this when you scrub through

193
00:11:58.550 --> 00:12:01.080
and just quickly scan through your video files.

194
00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:02.810
Ok guys I'll see you in the next lecture.

195
00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:05.150
Well we'll talk about another editing style.

196
00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:05.720
See you then.
