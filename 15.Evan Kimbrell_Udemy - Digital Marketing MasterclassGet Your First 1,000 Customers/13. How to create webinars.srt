1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:01,950
All right guys welcome back.

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:07,370
So spent last lecture talking about webinars what they are and why they're great for generating leads.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,440
So we'll talk now about how to create one of your own.

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,210
The first step is to decide on the web on our topic.

5
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:17,350
Pick something that appeals to your audience so they'll be compelled to sign up.

6
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,580
Try to form the idea into a clear and interesting title.

7
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,110
Nurses and doctors might like this one.

8
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:28,320
Dealing with difficult patients and their families or how to position yourself for promotion might appeal

9
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,220
to people who want a shitty job that pays better.

10
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:38,850
Many of our topics end up sounding like blog post titles but ok since the idea is roughly the same thing

11
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:43,830
you want to attract people with the cool sounding topic that they're going to be interested in and if

12
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:47,520
they know it's 60 minutes long and they can't sound like it's really dry and boring.

13
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,930
However don't be afraid to use your product or platform as the topic for your webinars.

14
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:56,700
Doing a platform demo seminar for example is something plenty of businesses do you just want to make

15
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:00,340
sure the seminar is helpful and don't make it to sales.

16
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:05,760
For example user testing just two or three webinars a month and mixes up topics so some weeks that talk

17
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,560
about industry events and popular topics and other weeks they focus on how to use key features of their

18
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,300
platform during a series of webinars while you should consider how your women are fits in with your

19
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:16,290
full schedule.

20
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:19,880
Try not to repeat topics because you won't get the same people back.

21
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,780
Plan out a series of complimentary topics over multiple webinars So your attendees will have continued

22
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,250
interest in whatever you're doing.

23
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,700
So what might your topic be for a web.

24
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:34,620
Maybe you'd want to do a Webinars on current trends in your industry or a how to tutorial for people

25
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:36,540
who use your product or platform.

26
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,100
The only trouble coming up with ideas.

27
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,310
Give these tips a shot.

28
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,000
Number one look at your most popular blog posts or social content.

29
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:47,610
Whatever is getting the most engagement likes comments and shares is probably hitting a nerve for some

30
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:48,160
reason.

31
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:52,550
Adapt that idea for a seminar format and build on what you learned from the earlier posts.

32
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:58,680
For example someone might ask a question on Quora that could answer like how do I monetize YouTube videos

33
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:00,370
while you compose an answer on Quora.

34
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:04,500
But if your audience would be interested in your answer as well you can also create a web that are on

35
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,540
the same topic and then go into more detail.

36
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:10,410
Also you can post ancora and then say oh by the way I did a Webinars on it.

37
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:12,210
Click here to ask your audience.

38
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:17,310
You could put up a question in a forum send out an email or post a survey on your website ask people

39
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:20,310
what topics they'd be most interested in hearing more about.

40
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:25,020
You don't even have to say it's for a webinar user's responses to plan webinars and the other posts

41
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:25,920
that you want to create.

42
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,440
Number three research competitor webinars.

43
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,170
Who else is putting out webinars that your audience might like.

44
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:33,600
Research your competitors and see what they're doing.

45
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:38,220
Attend one you can see how they're webinars and figure out how to make yours even better.

46
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:43,620
So once you have a topic in mind you'll figure out who will be involved with planning and the execution

47
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:44,990
of said seminar.

48
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:49,920
Someone needs to repair slides and write up scripts and notes half a script but it's generally a good

49
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,670
idea.

50
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,940
Someone needs to be the main speaker.

51
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:57,950
You might even need a weapon or helper as Wallack someone to advanced slides and answer any tech questions

52
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:03,030
all the seminars going and if you plan on featuring a guest speaker Well you'll need to invite them

53
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:03,600
as well.

54
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:05,980
So who are all these people.

55
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:10,990
If you're the writer and speaker great you have less people to try and wrangle.

56
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:15,540
But if there are other people potentially involved you'll need to contact them obviously in advance.

57
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:19,800
Get them to commit and put it on their schedule and obviously you got to remind them about it coming

58
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:21,450
on and making sure they show up.

59
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:22,610
Was problem.

60
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:27,300
The next step is to create an outline work through your topic and decide how you can break it up and

61
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,810
easy to follow sections.

62
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:33,510
You might decide to work with a speaker to develop it or have them do it themselves.

63
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:37,090
It's actually a really easy thing to do if you have an audience.

64
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,050
You say to an expert.

65
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,100
I have an audience.

66
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:41,260
You have information.

67
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,380
Why don't you teach it to my audience.

68
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:49,370
And it gives you exposure and it's a great way of keep upping the attention and engagement and retention

69
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:50,160
of my audience.

70
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:54,270
And irregardless if you creates the outline be aware of how much material you are probably going to

71
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:57,880
need to be creating mini webinars are scheduled to last an hour.

72
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:02,610
They usually have some kind of intro telling people who the speaker is and what the topic is as well

73
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:04,070
as housekeeping announcements.

74
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:06,000
Things like this is being recorded.

75
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:07,020
Do you have any questions.

76
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:12,410
Do this and whatever you write decide designed to build in time at the end of the hour for questions.

77
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:15,760
Maybe five maybe 10 maybe even as high as 20 minutes.

78
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:21,720
Up people are there so in a lot of cases you'll be responsible for coming up with roughly 40 to 45 minutes

79
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,930
of actual presentation content for an hour of webinars.

80
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:29,510
This amount of time is what you need to keep in mind as you write your script so take your outline it

81
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,560
start fleshing it out.

82
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,230
One hour should be as interactive as live in-person presentations are.

83
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:38,980
So make sure you build in places for actual interactions.

84
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,340
Just because this is online doesn't mean you need to speak on a headset for 40 minutes straight playing

85
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:44,250
to ask questions.

86
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,200
Get people involved.

87
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:48,400
How they respond will depend on what Web platform you use.

88
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:51,200
But usually people can do like a text chat reply.

89
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:55,820
They might be able to answer a poll on screen and other times they might be able to speak on their microphone.

90
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:59,420
As you're writing up the script you might decide to do a fully written script.

91
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:02,730
You might write something out and want to present it word for word.

92
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:07,170
Now the big risk here is that if you deliver a script that way it'll sound like you're reading it off.

93
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:09,250
That might make people lose interest quickly.

94
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:10,460
Can it just depends.

95
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:13,210
Everyone has their own speaking style but here's what I suggest.

96
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:17,560
Outline the parts you know and script the parts you don't if you're the expert doing all the speaking

97
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:21,910
then you might not need any script at all just a bullet list type outline to fall.

98
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:24,800
So actually have you done this type of presentation before.

99
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:27,850
Just fill in the gaps of what you know and just kind of keep things moving.

100
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:32,590
If there's something you want to ensure gets across perfectly then type that out a word of advice to

101
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:37,900
just practice this more than once once you have your notes and scripts and whatever in place just go

102
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:38,410
through it.

103
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:43,540
It's only an hour and that way at least you're not freaking out when you actually did do it for real.

104
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:48,280
Make sure that you leave in delays for parts where you hope people might ask questions or get involved

105
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:53,050
practicing on the actual presentation platforms even better since you'll know where the controls and

106
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:56,080
their features are located and you really shouldn't.

107
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:58,330
You don't want to get lost during the actual live event.

108
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:01,800
None of his advice is to use time markers to stay on schedule.

109
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:07,330
What I mean is figure out where you need to be after like say 15 minutes and then put a note about it

110
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:12,140
in your script like type in 15 minutes and big bold letters or something like that so you know if you're

111
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:17,020
not there in 15 minutes oh crap speeded up if you're going to show slides in your seminar most women

112
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:22,330
our platforms are going to probably be PowerPoint friendly meaning you should be able to just create

113
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:25,470
the slides and PowerPoint then import the file right in.

114
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:27,030
You make them say in like Keynote.

115
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:31,490
Well you probably have to export your slides as a PowerPoint format believe you can do.

116
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:33,350
Here's a tip when designing your slides.

117
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:35,850
Just try to keep them as simple as possible.

118
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:41,440
Don't do not put in transitions animations and don't put an embedded video files inside the slides.

119
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:47,470
A video playing through a live stream video to someone watching that video is there's too many things

120
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:48,220
that go wrong.

121
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:52,990
Now while it would be great to include visual pop and your webinars slides most web and our platforms

122
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:58,830
really socket making those effects actually work so try to avoid any unnecessary bells and whistles.

123
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:03,580
Stick with a simple slide design and try to important tests or slides as early as possible so you know

124
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,140
what's actually going to work.

125
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:08,500
Now that brings us to the issue of choosing a web in our provider and.

126
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:11,270
Well you've got some free options if you want.

127
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:14,370
Now the first one surprisingly is actually just YouTube and YouTube.

128
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:20,530
You can do a livestream to do a live stream just go to YouTube dot slashed live or it's a live underscored

129
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:22,410
da app or something like that.

130
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:27,010
And then you can just click on the upload button at the top of YouTube and then select a live streaming

131
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:30,370
as the option YouTube requires that you set up streaming software.

132
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:34,150
But YouTube has some pretty helpful directions to get you through each step.

133
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:36,640
So it's a pretty good free options.

134
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:40,930
I mean considering it's free now with YouTube you can't add a PowerPoint presentation but you can add

135
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:42,540
these things called cards.

136
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:46,870
You can have up to five cards and each card is kind of like a full screen image that you can show on

137
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:48,370
the screen whenever you want.

138
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:52,210
You can use these cards to share links but what are the best uses with webinars.

139
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:56,950
Probably actually to just conduct something like a poll prep poll question in advance and show it at

140
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:58,790
the right time to have people answer.

141
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:00,340
They can even see the results.

142
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:02,290
No no other free option is google hangout.

143
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:06,100
You can conduct your own webinars with up to 100 people watching for free.

144
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:09,190
You can incorporate slides unfortunately but it does have screen sharing.

145
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:14,320
So you could instead do is just show the slides on your computer through Screen Sharing.

146
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:20,560
You might have to download install the hangouts plug in but it's generally pretty easy to go to hangouts

147
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:21,850
dot Google dot com.

148
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:27,130
Now if you want access to more features like e-mail invites which is pretty nice especially things like

149
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:33,540
the ability to include presentation slides or how people manage people log in and get information from

150
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:34,260
them things like that.

151
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,300
Well you're probably going to go the paid option.

152
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:41,500
Now one really popular option is go to a meeting and they really they have a specific product for this

153
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:45,550
is called go to webinars and you can do it free for seven days if you want.

154
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:48,340
Now there's a lot of other providers out there.

155
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:52,850
There's any meeting there's one called Zoom I think we mentioned this earlier.

156
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:57,220
So if you want to do something bigger try those out see what fits your needs best.

157
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,890
Honestly I just tried doing the trial and see how it goes.

158
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:04,540
And if you can't live without it do it but otherwise Google Hangouts the works pretty well.

159
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,600
Now once you've got your provider and slides and script and everything ready to go.

160
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,080
Make sure you promote your seminar using the usual channels.

161
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:16,870
Remember this is a lead magnet so the other half of the portion of this process is getting that page

162
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:19,040
out there to get people to see it to sign up.

163
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:23,800
You can run ads you can post it on Facebook and slacke groups or wherever.

164
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:29,500
Make sure when you are highlighting this and promoting it that you make sure people know that it's free.

165
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,970
People love free stuff.

166
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,130
Your web provider for instance has built in e-mail invitations and you can actually upload a list and

167
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:38,680
then send out invites to your audience.

168
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:41,650
Already do what you can do to get people there.

169
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:45,970
Now during your web weapon our rely on your preparation do you practice really have nothing to worry

170
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:46,420
about.

171
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:50,740
Answer questions be friendly and remember why you're putting on this webinar in the first place.

172
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:54,340
You're trying to get leads and get them interested in you and your business.

173
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:58,570
If any problems arise obviously just stay cool and be human about it.

174
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:03,460
People generally forgive you ultimately webinars help you make new connections with your audience so

175
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:08,660
encourage them stay connected let them know to contact you for more information to follow your channels

176
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:09,510
on social.

177
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,920
Sign up for your e-mail visit your web site.

178
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:15,590
All the things that can result in more leads and engagement across the board.

179
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:17,130
And you're keeping your eye openers going.

180
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:21,220
Tell them when your next webinars will happen before they sign up.

181
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,260
They're looking for inspiration.

182
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:27,070
Here's a few seminars we're checking out lead pages at weekly web in our series and does a great job

183
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:31,930
of promoting it with a pretty nice landing page when you where you sign up.

184
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,900
Pictures or video preview which I think is a pretty nice touch of the kind of hard to do if you have

185
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,830
done this before but it is your second time at it.

186
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:38,620
It's pretty easy.

187
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:43,690
HubSpot also does a series called broadcast and what's nice is that they provide some resources to download

188
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:49,000
as well like a to do list that you can apply what you've learned from the presentation and you can fill

189
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,140
it out as you go through.

190
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:55,270
The other one was training mag and they do a bunch of webinars on professional development topics usually

191
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:59,970
a feature a few speakers and each one they have a different style so we're checking them out.

192
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:03,800
You also just go to youtube and search for webinars on blank.

193
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,700
And then a topic you're interested in.

194
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:08,070
YouTube has tons of Web recordings.

195
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:11,080
You can check out and you certainly find whatever topic you want.

196
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:13,450
You want to learn about there being be hosting.

197
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:15,960
I did a seminar and it's on YouTube you can find it.

198
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:20,250
So before you design yours I recommend looking to see what other people have done.

199
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,520
So there's a lot to consider when planning and executing webinars but they can be a lot of fun because

200
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,950
of all the people that can get involved.

201
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:27,750
Try one out.

202
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,890
See how it works for you.

203
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:31,390
Make sure you prep and rehearse for you a lot.

204
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:34,710
Try a free solution like YouTube streaming and see if you can get it to work.

205
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,410
Otherwise upgrade and pay a little bit more for.

206
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:42,260
Go to webinars and don't forget to attend webinars of your own to get an idea of how these work.

207
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,560
Ok guys that is it.

208
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,140
Good luck.

209
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,190
I'll see you in the next lecture.
