Hey guys, welcome back.

00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:07,420
Quick lecture here before we go on to scouting out the subs
we've selected. Reddit unfortunately is really, really distracting,

Quick lecture here before we go on to scouting out the subs
we've selected. Reddit unfortunately is really, really distracting,
3

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,390
and so if you're trying to optimize your time,
then you really need to streamline this process.
4

5
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:17,610
So there are two things I'd suggest doing at this stage.
5

6
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:23,280
Number one is go to reddit.com/subreddits and
look on the side of the page where it lists out all
6

7
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,940
of the subs you're already subscribed to.
7

8
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:32,110
Well, as it turns out, most of those are by default
and added when you signed up for everyone.
8

9
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:36,360
This is most likely what populates
the front page for you when you log in.
9

10
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:41,370
Do yourself a favor and just unsubscribe from all of the
ones that are not in the list we made in the last lecture.
10

11
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:42,090
Do yourself a favor and just unsubscribe from all of the
ones that are not in the list we made in the last lecture.
11

12
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:45,570
While they are great comedy gold,
they're not really helpful right now.
12

13
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:50,460
The second thing I want you to do is add a quick 
extension called Reddit Enhancement Suite to whatever
13

14
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:51,910
browser you are using.
14

15
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:56,850
If you're using Chrome, then it's perfect, just google it,
and you can add it in two seconds, and if you're on
15

16
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:59,040
Firefox, do another google.
16

17
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,830
Pretty sure it works for Firefox as well.
17

18
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:03,420
OK, it's also linked over in the resource section.
18

19
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:05,180
So just check it out.
19

20
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:10,140
Now, what this does, amongst many, many things, is it
allows you to better organize and keep track of what's
20

21
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:11,430
going on in Reddit.
21

22
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:14,910
It lets you, for instance, have multiple
accounts, which will come in handy later,
22

23
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:19,390
it lets you quickly keep track of where
in the comments an OP posts,
23

24
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:23,270
but most importantly of all, it lets
you tag and highlight users.
24

25
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,460
Why is this useful?
25

26
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:28,170
Well, because in the next couple of steps we're going
to start participating in the subs, and you'll start
26

27
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:31,940
to notice the regulars and the moderators,
the ones that are routinely posting.
27

28
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:36,450
It's always helpful to keep track of these people to make sure
you have an established at least some basic rapport with them.
28

29
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:37,950

29

30
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:40,370
So get that installed and play around with it for a second.
30

31
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,560
You can toggle it on and off by
clicking the icon in your browser.
31

32
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,980
That way, you can see what it is actually doing.
32

33
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:51,810
The way you tag someone is by clicking the tag next
to their name and then putting notes in colors or
33

34
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:55,680
whatever or not, or whether you want
notifications every time they post something.
34

35
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,670
All right, cool stuff.
35

36
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:57,600
See you in the next lecture.
