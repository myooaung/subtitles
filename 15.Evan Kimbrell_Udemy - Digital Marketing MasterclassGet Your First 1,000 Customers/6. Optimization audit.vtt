00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.400
Hey guys, welcome back to the course.
Checking back in for a bonus lecture.
1

2
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:05.280
Why is this bonus?
2

3
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:10.710
Well, because some of you guys need to follow this and
some of you are a little bit farther ahead and you can skip this.
3

4
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:11.780
Well, because some of you guys need to follow this and
some of you are a little bit farther ahead and you can skip this.
4

5
00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.250
We're going to talk specifically about optimization,
and specifically, we're going to answer the question
5

6
00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:27.210
of "Is your page ready, if you send traffic to it, to let customers
buy your product or service in a relatively easy way?"
6

7
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:28.730
of "Is your page ready, if you send traffic to it, to let customers
buy your product or service in a relatively easy way?"
7

8
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:29.660
Now, shocker.
8

9
00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:36.810
If your site isn't ready from a functional sense, it can't
collect payment, then you're not going to obviously
9

10
00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.630
be successful. It doesn't matter how
much traffic you send to your page,
10

11
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:45.090
obviously they can't pay you, therefore all of
your marketing efforts are going to be a waste.
11

12
00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:52.680
Now, a little bit further than that, if your page
isn't optimized in at least a minimal regard,
12

13
00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:59.030
you're also going to run into problems, you're going
to run into what I call the illusion of a failed campaign.
13

14
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.060
What I mean by that is, let's say you're building out
your marketing strategy, you picked your channels,
14

15
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:09.120
you get out there, and you start running them, and
people are responding in a positive way. They like what
15

16
00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.890
you're saying, they like your marketing message,
16

17
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.320
they're clearly resonating with the way that you're
pitching to them, but then as soon as they get to
17

18
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.920
your website, nothing seems to happen.
18

19
00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:25.830
Now, if that happened to you, you would just assume
that you misread the situation and that they don't
19

20
00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.090
like what you are saying, or you're gathering
or collecting the wrong people.
20

21
00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.750
Now, I call it an illusion because you might think that
you scored yourself a win and you learned something,
21

22
00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:42.420
but in reality there's no way you could know whether
or not it's because your page makes no sense and
22

23
00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.300
it just encourages people to leave, or you
used an ineffective marketing technique.
23

24
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.620
Now, if your site is already set up, and you've taken
sales, and you're reasonably confident that your
24

25
00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.670
site makes sense, please skip this lecture.
25

26
00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:56.580
Do not watch it.
26

27
00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.690
I do not want to hear you complain about
me talking about things you already know.
27

28
00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.640
This is just a quick pit stop for those of you out there
that want to make a quick audit of your website
28

29
00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.080
to make sure that it is at least set up
in a way that you can be successful.
29

30
00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:15.540
If your site is not set up in a way that, one, users can
understand, two, easily and in an effective way
30

31
00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:22.180
conveys the benefits of your product or service,
and three, allows users to easily pay you,
31

32
00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.350
your site is just going to be a dud.
32

33
00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.820
So for our audit, we're going to go over those
three things. Can your users understand your site?
33

34
00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.840
So for our audit, we're going to go over those
three things. Can your users understand your site?
34

35
00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.450
Can they figure out the benefits of your service
relatively quickly? And can they pay you?
35

36
00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.720
All right.
36

37
00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.840
Let's look at a website, as an example, that makes
sense. I'm sure you guys have heard of this one.
37

38
00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.440
This in general makes sense. I see where I sign up,
38

39
00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.120
This in general makes sense. I see where I sign up,
39

40
00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.210
I see what they are claiming it does,
40

41
00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.260
I can scroll down and see what the features are and why
they are benefits, and if I want to learn more, that's great, it's
41

42
00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.890
I can scroll down and see what the features are and why
they are benefits, and if I want to learn more, that's great, it's
42

43
00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:56.710
very simple. And again, areas where
I can go to the next step if I am interested.
43

44
00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:59.280
Now, let's look at one that makes absolutely no sense.
44

45
00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.250
Have you used this one before? Because it is just so weird.
45

46
00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.940
Poker Coach 2.
46

47
00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.310
Can anyone tell what this is?
47

48
00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.450
I mean, I can kind of guess from
the name, but "Challenge PokerSnowie 
48

49
00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.550
now with live, real time advice."
Who is PokerSnowie? And "Get it now,"
49

50
00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:19.740
what do I get and how is that 20% off?
What is that man at the bottom telling me?
50

51
00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:22.860
I just want to leave, because I'm confused.
Now, which one of those two
51

52
00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.290
are you? Most likely, you're somewhere in the middle,
52

53
00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:26.820
but you can still stand to improve.
53

54
00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:31.120
Now, if you look like PokerSnowie,
well then, thank God you watch this lecture.
54

55
00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.220
Now to get from PokerSnowie to Dropbox,
55

56
00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.090
there's two things I want you to do.
56

57
00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.430
They're quick and easy.
57

58
00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.740
All right.
58

59
00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:39.390
Grab a Word document,
59

60
00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:44.260
piece of paper, or anything you can write
something down on, and in one sentence
60

61
00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.030
- actually do this, I want you to do this -
61

62
00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.580
- actually do this, I want you to do this -
62

63
00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:52.440
write down what exactly your
product or service is and does.
63

64
00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:58.890
Now, if I were selling an iPhone cover, I would say
"It's a rubber cover that protects your iPhone."
64

65
00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:03.860
"It is a rubber cover and it protects your iPhone."
That's what that "does" is and what the "is" is.
65

66
00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:04.190
All right.
66

67
00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:08.450
Now that you have that done,
I want you to look at your home page
67

68
00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:17.190
with that in mind. In two seconds, 2-3 seconds,
can you tell what exactly your page does?
68

69
00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.030
Can you tell that it does
69

70
00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:24.720
that sentence that you just wrote down? If users
cannot immediately tell what the point of the page is,
70

71
00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:31.150
or at least what the general topic is, you're
always going to have people leave in droves.
71

72
00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:37.320
Now, the second thing you can do is ask a friend,
literally anyone. Say, "Hey, look at my web page" and do
72

73
00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.610
not tell them what it is, don't tell them what
it does, and then just ask them immediately,
73

74
00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.780
"Can you tell what this page is or what it's for?"
74

75
00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:50.190
If they can figure it out relatively easy, and they're
not giving you an answer that's completely wrong,
75

76
00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:56.830
then good job, but if they can't, you really need to
work on your clutter and/or your organization.
76

77
00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.210
You can actually use a tool.
77

78
00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:59.220
You can check this one out.
78

79
00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.010
Bonus tip: fivesecondtest.com,
that's a great website, it's free,
79

80
00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:04.020
Bonus tip: fivesecondtest.com,
that's a great website, it's free,
80

81
00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:08.190
all you have to do is take a picture of your site, post
it online, and then in generally 30 minutes you'll
81

82
00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:11.310
have people say what they think it does in five seconds.
82

83
00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:17.820
Now, the number two thing we need to do in our audit
is check, does our page convey what the benefits
83

84
00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:21.360
of our product or service is? In a short period of time,
84

85
00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:27.730
can I see on the page why I should buy
this and how this is going to benefit me?
85

86
00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:32.610
Now, it doesn't have to be the largest text in the world,
but you need to have something on the page to
86

87
00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:40.310
convince them, you cannot just simply have a description of
what it is and that is it, they need some persuasion. Now, if I
87

88
00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:42.030
was selling that iPhone case
88

89
00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:44.670
we just talked about, and I just said "iPhone case,"
89

90
00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:51.090
no one would buy from me. Even if I just said "iPhone
case" and I put a picture of a beautiful iPhone case,
90

91
00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:51.580
no one would buy from me. Even if I just said "iPhone
case" and I put a picture of a beautiful iPhone case,
91

92
00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:59.100
people still will probably not buy from me, because
they still need to hear what exactly it is and how
92

93
00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:02.010
it's going to cradle my iPhone like a newborn baby.
93

94
00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:06.600
And the last thing we need to check
in our quick audit is, can they pay you?
94

95
00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:10.860
If someone were happy, satisfied, you convinced
them that they are going to pay you money,
95

96
00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:12.270
can they actually do it?
96

97
00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:16.350
I mean, literally, can they do it?
Now, if you're not selling something,
97

98
00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:20.940
keep this in mind, or you're doing
a free service or something like that,
98

99
00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:24.980
well, your currency is probably
going to be e-mail addresses.
99

100
00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:29.330
So the question then becomes, can
they submit their e-mail address to you
100

101
00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:32.150
and is it not too arduous of a process to do that?
101

102
00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.030
Now, there's no excuse to not add payments
102

103
00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:36.420
nowadays, there's so many options for doing this.
103

104
00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:42.480
People don't want to mail you cash, and they don't
want to mail you checks or pay you in Bitcoin.
104

105
00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:45.200
They want the normal options for payment.
105

106
00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:51.150
In the next lecture, we're going to demo adding a Stripe
payment account just so I can show you how dead
106

107
00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:54.570
simple it is, you can do it in five minutes.
107

108
00:06:54.570 --> 00:07:01.800
Now, if you guys are on a platform like Shopify, or
Wordpress, or Magento, or Drupal, or any of those big
108

109
00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:05.200
bloated things, you might just have to Google it.
109

110
00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:07.330
They all support payments.
110

111
00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:14.330
You just need to figure out how exactly to do it, you
just type in the name of your platform + "payments"
111

112
00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:18.310
or "credit cards" and they almost always will have a guide.
112

113
00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:25.020
And if all else fails, for some reason you cannot do
that, if you are in the U.S., Canada, and Europe, at
113

114
00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:32.340
least, this is a fallback technique you can do. Go to
Square.com - have you ever seen Square before? - they are
114

115
00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:36.720
a credit card processing company that's kind of
democratized the process for everyone. Sign up for an
115

116
00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:41.950
account, you will get approved roughly in 24
hours, unless you're a terrorist organization,
116

117
00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:47.820
and then what you can do is download the application.
Then, at that point, you can collect credit cards
117

118
00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:50.110
by manually typing them in.
118

119
00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:55.620
So if someone wants to pay you, just set it up such
that they input the information, it looks encrypted,
119

120
00:07:55.620 --> 00:08:01.080
it gets sent to you, and you can do it manually until
later you can add a payment source or you can call
120

121
00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:03.120
them and do it over the phone.
121

122
00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:10.600
True story. For the first two years of running
Sprintkick, the web studio that I run,
122

123
00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:15.740
that's actually how I collected payments. I called
clients and said "This is how much is due.
123

124
00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:20.550
Please just read me your credit card. "People are
actually fine with that, because they assume a phone
124

125
00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:25.000
is actually more secure than a credit card page.
125

126
00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:26.280
It's not true at all.
126

127
00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:29.450
Phones are much less secure
than a credit card page, but whatever.
127

128
00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:30.430
That's what people think.
128

129
00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:32.080
So check your stuff over.
129

130
00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:38.640
If an idiot were to come to your page, can they figure
out, one, what you do, why they should buy it, and
130

131
00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:40.260
can they figure out how to pay you?
131

132
00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.800
If you don't meet those three, please fix it.
132

133
00:08:42.810 --> 00:08:45.660
Otherwise, the rest of this course
is going to be worthless for you.
133

134
00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:51.090
Now, in the next lecture, I'm going to demo this, I'm
going to show you a really screwed up page, and I'm
134

135
00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:56.610
going to show you how you can very quickly and
easily convert it to one that is actually, that actually
135

136
00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:59.250
