00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,520
Hey guys, welcome back to the course.
1

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:08,450
Remember the 19 things we talked about last lecture?
Well, we only listed them off rather mysteriously.
2

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:14,070
So, in this lecture, called "The 19 channels explained,"
it's actually two lectures, or as I like to call
3

4
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:17,380
it, "How many can Evan explain before getting tired?"
4

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,530
Probably 10.
5

6
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:19,490
Why only 10?
6

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,170
Well, because 10 of these 19 are the main ones,
7

8
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,840
and coincidentally, it's what we cover in the course.
8

9
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:32,150
The other nine stragglers are kind of weird,
too specific I think to be helpful in this course.
9

10
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:37,280
So at the end of this lecture you'll know the basics
of the 10 main ways people get customers.
10

11
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:44,130
I would imagine you know some or most of these,
but please just suck it up or skip the lecture.
11

12
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:48,480
The other nine we'll include as a resource
either in this lecture or the next.
12

13
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,670
Seriously, they're kind of weird.
13

14
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,000
We're talking about things like giant posters on
the highway, used primarily to guilt you into going
14

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,270
to church or which exit to take to blow
your life savings on slot machines.
15

16
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,770
Also known as billboards.
16

17
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,500
Was that only a thing in America?
17

18
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,240
If you are disappointed that we are not
covering billboards, I apologize.
18

19
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:09,030
Also, good luck with that, you billboard-preneur.
19

20
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:10,020
All right, let's get this started.
20

21
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:15,630
Number one, SEO. SEO, for the non-initiated,
means search engine optimization.
21

22
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:19,430
People search for things online and they
do so through places like Google
22

23
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,660
and... really it's just Google.
23

24
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:26,690
If you use Bing, then your family needs
to have an intervention, because... that's nice,
24

25
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,370
I also bet you're still a proud user of Hotmail.
25

26
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:49,460
When you search for things, Google will
present you with a list of relevant results.
26

27
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:54,590
A company that pursues an SEO strategy is going to
focus on finding ways of changing the language on
27

28
00:01:54,590 --> 00:02:01,070
their site or planning certain keywords, titles, tags,
and pages in a way that gets the most exposure in
28

29
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:02,570
those search results.
29

30
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:09,740
These strategies generally consist of, one, tweaking
your page, two, getting people to link to you, and three,
30

31
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:13,380
researching keywords before
you actually create the pages.
31

32
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,760
Yes, I know, recently it's changed quite a bit.
32

33
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:16,550
We'll cover that.
33

34
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:19,430
How many searches are there on Google in a day?
34

35
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:28,160
3.5 billion, with a B. That is 40,000 searches every second.
SEO, if done well, can be an absolute monster of a channel.
35

36
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:28,990
3.5 billion, with a B. That is 40,000 searches every second.
SEO, if done well, can be an absolute monster of a channel.
36

37
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,500
#crushit.
37

38
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:30,080
#crushit.
38

39
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,920
Number two, SEM.
39

40
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:37,790
Following up on that last one, when people search
on Google, they will be shown ads mixed in with the
40

41
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:39,130
search results they get.
41

42
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:43,520
With Google, it's pretty obvious what is
an ad and what is not an ad, and with Bing,
42

43
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:49,610
well, I'm kind of assuming it's all an ad, because
Bing is terrible. SEM goes something like this.
43

44
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,640
SEO can take forever,
44

45
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:53,800
so why not skip the line instead?
45

46
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:58,840
Companies pay for these ads in the hopes that
you'll click them and get diverted to their page.
46

47
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:01,500
That's why we call it search engine marketing,
47

48
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:07,760
SEM. The way that this works is that companies will
place bids for placement in key positions they want,
48

49
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:08,330
SEM. The way that this works is that companies will
place bids for placement in key positions they want,
49

50
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:15,580
and when someone clicks on that ad, then they pay.
If you want to be a terrible person, go search 
50

51
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:23,510
mesothelioma and then click an ad. You just charged
a law firm about $140. Seriously, just for that one click.
51

52
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:23,930
Anyway, hence the acronyms for cost per click,
52

53
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:27,080
Anyway, hence the acronyms for cost per click,
53

54
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:33,710
CPA or cost per action, and CPM, cost per mille.
54

55
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:39,590
Just kidding, literally no one on earth knows what
the M in CPM stands for. Pro tip: the order that the
55

56
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:43,360
ads are displayed in correlates to,
number one, how much they bid,
56

57
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:46,900
and number two, how well
their website relates to your search.
57

58
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:50,640
We will cover this in the course.
Number three, content marketing.
58

59
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:56,480
This is when a business creates free or very low priced
content and distributes it online with the idea
59

60
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:02,360
that they can, one, pitch their business somewhere
inside of that content, or two, increase their exposure
60

61
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:07,520
and attract people to check out the rest of their site.
Content is a term developed by the government
61

62
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,820
to drive you crazy by its sheer lack of specificity.
62

63
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:17,960
Your blog - content, your YouTube comment - content,
your cat learns how to type - content. And it is said so
63

64
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:22,250
often that some - mostly me - say
that it is the vegan of the internet.
64

65
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,810
Please stop talking about it.
65

66
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:25,700
The number one thing people do this through,
66

67
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,120
can you guess it?
67

68
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:35,060
Blogs. Blogs, spelled B-L-A-G-S and actually pronounced blags,
are essentially free content that is shared with the public,
68

69
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:35,730
Blogs. Blogs, spelled B-L-A-G-S and actually pronounced blags,
are essentially free content that is shared with the public,
69

70
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:43,910
and in return the business gets email addresses,
or leads, or just traffic to their site. Number four, PR.
70

71
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,890
When I say PR, I just mean public relations.
71

72
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,880
It's what we mean when we say "get press."
72

73
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:55,500
It means media outlets primarily, but you can extend it
to larger blocks and sites that have a following.
73

74
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,830
Primarily, these are topical,
74

75
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:02,990
"Your company did something," but there are also entire
strategies built around getting more mentions and
75

76
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:06,410
how to keep media outlets talking about you forever.
76

77
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:09,560
This is probably the closest
you'll ever get to being famous.
77

78
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,670
Number five, social and display advertising.
78

79
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:15,830
Remember when we talked about search engine
marketing, it was like, I don't know, 3 minutes ago?
79

80
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,770
Remember when we talked about search engine
marketing, it was like, I don't know, 3 minutes ago?
80

81
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:18,070
Well, if you're interested
81

82
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:23,450
in search, you'll probably be interested in social.
Social advertising is when you take out ads on sites
82

83
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:25,090
like Facebook or Twitter.
83

84
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:29,610
The advantage of this is that you can base
your ads instead of on what they search for,
84

85
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:34,160
you can base it on what they like or their demographics.
85

86
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:37,440
Are you a 24-year old white male in a college town?
86

87
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:41,500
Well, if I were working for Chipotle,
I would be all up in your news feed.
87

88
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:44,200
You can even do creepy things like target by behaviors.
88

89
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:50,440
Facebook, for instance, can let you advertise to people
who are looking to move from their home soon.
89

90
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:52,310
Yes, I know, it's incredibly weird.
90

91
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:57,050
Now, the second part of this is display advertising, which
basically amounts to things like banner ads and Google AdSense.
91

92
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:58,270
Now, the second part of this is display advertising, which
basically amounts to things like banner ads and Google AdSense.
92

93
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:02,380
These are big blocks of images
or text that you see on your page
93

94
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:03,820
trying to get you to click them.
94

95
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,810
Do they work anymore?
95

96
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:08,770
Maybe. I lump these two together why?
96

97
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:15,530
Well, because in both cases you are in fact displaying
some sort of an image, unlike Google, with obviously
97

98
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:17,510
the exception being Google AdSense.
98

99
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:22,760
All right, are you out of breath? Because I sure am.
Next lecture, we'll wrap up the remaining five.
99

100
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,410
See you then.
