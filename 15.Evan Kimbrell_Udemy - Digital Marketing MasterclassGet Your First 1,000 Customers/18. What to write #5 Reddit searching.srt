1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:02,380
All right guys welcome back to the course.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:07,770
I'd like to dig into one more potential source of ideas for writing content and it's one should remember

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:09,770
earlier from in the course Reddit.

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:14,850
Now back when we talked about getting your first hundred customers we discussed red it's Obreht it's

5
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:16,600
karma and all that.

6
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:21,150
I asked you to make some list of subsets and some other things on the site you should check out that

7
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:23,170
are relevant to your product or your business.

8
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,630
Now go get them now because you'll need them here.

9
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,180
It's cool.

10
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:27,720
Always.

11
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:28,980
Well just like Twitter.

12
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:34,500
But sumo and the Google Keyword planner ran it can be a source of inspiration for new content by digging

13
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:39,540
into those subset it's relevant to your products or industry and locating posts with lots of updates

14
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:40,520
and comments.

15
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,000
You'll be able to find this stuff.

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,390
Your audience is most interested in and most passionate about.

17
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:51,630
So once you find those great threads you can create new blog post articles videos and other content

18
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:58,080
of your own allowing you to attract more followers and more customers just like it attracted readers

19
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:58,680
on Reddit.

20
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:02,260
Curious I'll give you a quick example of using it for content ideas.

21
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:07,740
Let's say you sell website design services it's a common one way views but it is very common and you

22
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:13,500
work in Photoshop and Illustrator and you decided to blog about design tools to show off your expertise

23
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,160
and maybe attract some new clients.

24
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:20,650
So the graphic design subset it probably is going to be a place you're going to want to hang out and

25
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:22,820
online to see what people are talking about.

26
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:25,190
OK let's look at that some right.

27
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:25,490
OK.

28
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:29,460
So here we are it's a graphic design sub read it and we can see two types of stats.

29
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:33,380
We scroll down the list of threads see up votes and you see comments.

30
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:37,650
I don't find them threads are both because it means people find that thread or information being shared

31
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:42,340
valuable and people are commenting because there's something that needs to be said.

32
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:47,550
In other words which threads are generating the most reactions now rather than search.

33
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:51,120
I'm just going to head up the top button at the top and get a sorted list.

34
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:54,590
OK now by default you might see items in the last 24 hours.

35
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,980
But you know timeliness isn't actually important to me.

36
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:02,100
I'm going to change this filter at the top to past month to see what shows up.

37
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:05,190
Now there's a lot of items and some of these have a lot of those.

38
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:07,690
Put Not a lot of comments.

39
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:10,200
I don't obviously like something with a bit of both.

40
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:15,110
I'd also like to see if there's something about Photoshop because that's one of the tools I use.

41
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,630
Ok so maybe these are Prema.

42
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:17,960
So I'm going to keep looking.

43
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:18,230
Ok.

44
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:20,090
Here is actually something interesting.

45
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,890
I'm still using C6.

46
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:25,690
It's a version of Photoshop but maybe I'm thinking of upgrading a CC.

47
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:28,280
What are your opinions of s.c.

48
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:33,170
Now this has some uploads and some comments and you can tell someone is looking for advice.

49
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:37,230
Now if I were to show off my expertise as a graphic designer and this is the kind of question that I

50
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:42,450
could answer in a unique way so I could immediately jump out to my wordpress blog or a Web site and

51
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:48,130
write an article called Photoshop see 6 versus CC should you upgrade or something like that.

52
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:50,750
I can give my own opinion and my own spin.

53
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:55,550
But here's why Reddit is really a great source for brining an article like this.

54
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:00,300
Let's actually dig into that thread that we looked at the Reddit started and read the comments starting

55
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,710
with the original post.

56
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:06,710
Now opposer says he's not crazy about the new subscription model required to use the CC version.

57
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,170
Fair enough and he's asking CC users if it's worth it.

58
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:15,990
Now the top commenter is a guy who is hanging on to CSX for dear life trying to make it work.

59
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:21,600
The next commenter says he subscribed to the entire suite but can afford it because of the number of

60
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,130
projects he's got.

61
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:29,190
OK now in general the top comments in a Reddit thread usually show the angle or point that people are

62
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:32,330
most in favor of or most passionate about.

63
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:37,350
If you have one corner with a lot of votes or more uploads in the others then you're probably looking

64
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:41,360
at something that represents somewhat of the consensus of the group.

65
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:47,180
That's what they generally believe is the correct or most relevant answer to the thread posting.

66
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:50,910
If you keep digging through the comments on that Photoshop post you'll come across some interesting

67
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:51,680
points.

68
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:54,620
Most commenters are saying the new version runs fine.

69
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:59,010
They're all saying if you're a student you might be able to get Photoshop for free through your school

70
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:04,680
and then other people said Forget Oh altogether and then they said and go with a different product line

71
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,600
called affinity designer so you could have written that article of yours.

72
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,960
Answering the original question asked by the poster.

73
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:16,110
But with the comments in the other feedback we can actually now create a much richer piece of content

74
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:22,570
that includes tips alternatives and a general consensus from a basically like a focus group rather than

75
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:24,150
guess your way through advice.

76
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:28,860
Research like this can confirm what you believe or at least present some different angles.

77
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,850
If you had to break this redit research down to a process it basically just be like this.

78
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:37,910
Number one Gudu a relevant subject and click the top button to see the most popular post.

79
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,270
If you've been following along with the course.

80
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:42,990
We've already made a list of relevant sobre so you should have it handy.

81
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:49,080
The second step number two would be to find posts with both votes and comments and the number three.

82
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:53,460
If a post is something you'd like to write about then dig into the comments and see what people are

83
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,000
saying which leads you to number for the last step.

84
00:04:56,010 --> 00:05:00,360
Consider how you can write an article giving your angle and maybe incorporating the best what you've

85
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,880
seen and the comments and then you just rinse and repeat.

86
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:07,280
Give those steps a whirl and see what you can come with on your own.

87
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:13,200
If you have say in all three sobriety you check out regularly and you can find three or four posts in

88
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:18,750
each one that you think have good material when you're looking at at least 10 new blog posts or article

89
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:21,300
ideas just from this one technique.

90
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:23,060
It doesn't take long either.

91
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:29,070
Repeat this once a month with all the other research you do and you should really never run out of ideas

92
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:30,000
any time soon.

93
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,900
One last thing I want to mention since we're talking about read it anyway here is let's say you come

94
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,740
up with a cool piece of content based on a Reddit thread.

95
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:41,260
Well you already know one audience that might be interested in reading that.

96
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,250
Sobre it.

97
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:47,210
So feel free to jump in and share the link in your post or in the comments.

98
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:51,330
Editors are people too they like to get credit for cool things they did or said.

99
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:56,130
So make sure to link back to the original thread that gave you all the ideas and inspiration and mentioned

100
00:05:56,130 --> 00:06:01,410
those helpful writers who had interesting things to say your piece could help you gain a larger audience

101
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:04,990
within that group of people that could actually be pretty interesting.

102
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:05,800
So there you go.

103
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:09,030
Revise it read it and find good content to inspire the next post.

104
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:10,310
It's really as simple as that.

105
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,300
See the next lecture.
