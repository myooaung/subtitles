00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:00,720
Hey guys.

2
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:02,430
Welcome back to the course.

3
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:06,660
Now I want to start off this lecture with a kind of an observation.

4
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:13,230
I was on Twitter recently and I kept seeing these companies that offer services like apps or whatever

5
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:16,120
just random products as tools things like that.

6
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:21,120
And they kept sharing links to these really Din's guides that are just full of information.

7
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,570
I'm sure you've seen them.

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:28,620
People sharing things like the beginner's guide to starting a blog or 57 illustrator tutorials for creating

9
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:29,470
a logo.

10
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:36,240
Now wouldn't you see companies whose focus is selling an app or selling some widget and they're spending

11
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:40,060
all this time and money promoting information.

12
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:43,800
You've got to wonder now why is it exactly that they're doing that.

13
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,370
Why did they create that e-book.

14
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:53,100
Why did they make some ridiculously long resource guide on how to do something vaguely related to what

15
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,480
they're involved in.

16
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,620
How exactly does this pay off for them.

17
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:02,640
Well this process of creating posts and documents and any other information the company thinks might

18
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:09,990
be valuable in posting those online and then promoting them is all part of what we the marketing hipsters

19
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:12,210
call a content strategy.

20
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:17,130
Now what's the point of content strategy doing the things I just described.

21
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:22,880
Well there's actually good points to why you might want to do a content strategy.

22
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:28,780
Really the idea is to drive traffic back to your Web site where they can sell all of their things.

23
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:36,390
So they look at this information that you shared then presumably they there are now more aware of you

24
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:39,430
or they click through somewhere else on your Web site.

25
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:45,690
They give you their email address in some way that you can then sell them later or next page they click

26
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:46,040
on.

27
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:48,580
Oftentimes the point of content marketing is twofold.

28
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:54,180
Sometimes it'll be to share information so that the audience understands your product better and is

29
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,780
therefore more willing to buy and or use it.

30
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:02,890
Generally speaking the idea is to satisfy some need for your potential customers out there.

31
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:10,890
So they'll then consider you a helpful source of information and eventually that trust and that affinity

32
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:16,420
they've built will kind of bleed over into other things namely things that you can make money off of.

33
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:22,020
But all of those things the driving of the traffic the sharing of the information the satisfying of

34
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,780
needs connecting with people.

35
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:28,850
All of that is going to be done through the content they produce.

36
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:30,870
That's why we call it content marketing.

37
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:38,300
And yes I know content is one of those words those terms that's just kind to Soon as I say content it

38
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:45,570
kind of floats off away into the air just dissipates cause it's really vague and it's oftentimes meaningless

39
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:49,320
as someone who really likes to define a lot of things.

40
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:51,650
I honestly cannot stand that word.

41
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,010
And it pains me.

42
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:55,330
But we're going to be doing this section before we do.

43
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:57,570
Let's establish what content can mean.

44
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:05,370
Now content could refer to a blog post Tichenor for social media posts videos podcast infographics e-books

45
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:12,150
e-mail pretty much anything you can think of that provides information or value and it's not in the

46
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,410
form of the actual product or service.

47
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:19,470
So don't think of a content strategy as the same thing as say like a blog strategy.

48
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:25,470
It's much much bigger than that and you can take advantage of the flexibility of content.

49
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:30,840
The ability to create lots of different kinds of things to Baskett across the right message.

50
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:36,270
When you run an ad campaign you only get a couple sentences across but if you run a content marketing

51
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:42,630
campaign oftentimes your customers will be reading the equivalent of a book that you wrote for them.

52
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:48,340
It gives you a lot of opportunity to kind of frame how they see you and kind of set yourself up as this

53
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:54,270
this figure that gives them lots of good information for you the viewer at home as part of your content

54
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:59,910
strategy you might create lists or you might develop some of those big beginners guides that kind of

55
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:01,300
referenced earlier.

56
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,120
And the process will be clear.

57
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:09,330
You know you define an audience you focus on one of their needs or a way to help them you then create

58
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:13,320
high quality information or the highest quality information you can.

59
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,560
You publish it where your audience can find it.

60
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:19,770
You promote it and then you engage with your audience when they respond to it.

61
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:25,740
At the end of the day if you create content that is valuable to your audience whether it be in a blog

62
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:32,130
form an email and infographics ebook whatever it is and then you make sure your audience can find and

63
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:33,360
use that information.

64
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:39,150
Well in general you're going to grow an audience and then you're really one step away from increasing

65
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:39,960
your sales.

66
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:45,720
Now in this section we're to go through the process of developing a content strategy one step at a time

67
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:53,460
for your business if you know you have no interest in producing information that your audience finds

68
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,400
valuable.

69
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,770
You don't want to write blogs.

70
00:04:55,770 --> 00:05:03,140
You don't really want to spend a lot of time doing these side tasks creating these topical kind of things

71
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:09,230
that your audience might digest well maybe this is not something that you dive right into.

72
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:14,720
I would suggest still watching the section tell it will help you become a better marketer and understand

73
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,440
how other companies get their customers.

74
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:23,420
And of course if you're itching to just make a guide on something that you think would be really really

75
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:27,500
useful for your customers and you really can get excited at that idea.

76
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,810
Well then I'll see in the next lecture.
