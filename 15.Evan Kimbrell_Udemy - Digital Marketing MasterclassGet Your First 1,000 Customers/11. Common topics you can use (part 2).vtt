00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:01.410
All right welcome back.

2
00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:06.510
So in the last video I showed you a process for finding sites and blogs that have a similar content

3
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:09.600
category and scope or categories.

4
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:15.020
The topic you're covering are focusing in on and scope just describes.

5
00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:22.130
Is it a broad range of things around that category or is it laser focused on more specific things.

6
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.980
Hopefully you did what I told you to do and you went out and search and you have a few good leads by

7
00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:26.360
now.

8
00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:32.070
If so we can move forward because in this lecture on a dig into this sites and find good topics you

9
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.720
can use for your own content.

10
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.810
Now let's say you provide I.T. support for local businesses.

11
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.300
They contact you when they need a network setup or a printer fax because they can't afford a dedicated

12
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:48.330
team and you fill that need for the sake of this example let's say you are content category is going

13
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.350
to be customer support.

14
00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:51.050
OK.

15
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:56.700
That's what you're going to write about how to do great customer support what you can learn from the

16
00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.510
support you provide and how customers can benefit from it too.

17
00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.720
These gen ideas can attract customers you want because they see how smart you are and it can also attract

18
00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.850
other support people out there trying to up their game.

19
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.030
That's your target market.

20
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.060
That's what they're looking for.

21
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.520
So if customer support is your category let's go out to Google and start searching.

22
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.810
OK I'm going to start with customer support blog like we did in the last lecture just to see what comes

23
00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:22.190
up.

24
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.330
Look at one of the first results is a site called Groove HQ.

25
00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.570
Do they support people who still love disco.

26
00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.910
I don't know I'm not really sure why they're called groove but that's OK let's just give them a look.

27
00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:33.470
Click through.

28
00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:38.130
So I clicked in and I see OK list customer support software at the top.

29
00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.500
So I guess that's largely what they do.

30
00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.850
And yes I scroll down and I see that they have some articles looks like it's a weekly blog.

31
00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.000
They all relate to customer support.

32
00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.330
There's stuff about tips support stats techniques.

33
00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.770
OK.

34
00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:52.140
OK.

35
00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.290
So I would definitely make a note of this one.

36
00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.420
It's pretty much free in the area we're looking for.

37
00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.040
Great that's all I need to know to just write this one down and come back to it later for a deeper dive.

38
00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.520
Moving back to the Google results we see another one.

39
00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.110
OK.

40
00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.260
Help Scout is one unless and it's one of actually heard of.

41
00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.780
So let's click through it.

42
00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:11.890
Help scout.

43
00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:17.640
Looks like they've built a customer support platform that tracks interactions provides reports for teams

44
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.120
and a whole lot more.

45
00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.410
Basically want to improve the lives of helpdesks and their customers.

46
00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:24.600
This is very relevant.

47
00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:30.150
So on help Scouts blog support is one of their primary categories.

48
00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.110
I also see growth and culture.

49
00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.540
And overall it doesn't look that Braund But still this still works.

50
00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:37.920
I like to look at this site too.

51
00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.360
I'm going to add it to my list.

52
00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.800
But this time I want to dig in and check a few posts to see what topics they're running about.

53
00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.610
First doing this quick check will sometimes allow you to get ideas as well.

54
00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.790
First I'm going to click on the support of customer support trends 2017.

55
00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.040
Now I don't know what the support of is.

56
00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:00.210
Seems like maybe it's the name of a series or something like that but I do know what customer support

57
00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.420
trends 2017 means.

58
00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:05.900
This would be an example of an industry trends post.

59
00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.340
This is one of the topics almost anyone can write about no matter what industry you're in.

60
00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.900
So I'm cooking inside and I can see what they've got.

61
00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.550
There's a 30 minute video at the top where they offer predictions for chazzan 17 and that's followed

62
00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.870
by links to some other prediction posts from around the industry.

63
00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:27.600
So what helps Scott has done here is they've dug into other industry posts looking for predictions data

64
00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.310
and insights they could use to create a list relevant to their readers.

65
00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.180
They didn't do exhaustive surveys or hire a research firm.

66
00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:38.130
They found what they needed on line.

67
00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.610
Link to it and remix it with information they already had.

68
00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.750
So could you make an industry trends post for your site.

69
00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:46.750
Absolutely.

70
00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:52.920
One approach is to try what helps Scout debt review existing prediction post and make your own relevant

71
00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.060
posts about them.

72
00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:59.850
Some industry post cover way more than is necessary so pick out the relevant bits for yourself and your

73
00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:04.170
audience and create a post just about those specific pieces.

74
00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.000
There's a million different ways you can angle this.

75
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.260
One reason I like this is because other sources have already done some of the heavy lifting for you

76
00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:11.790
and it gives you a jumpstart.

77
00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:14.800
Another way to create an industry post is to go straight to the source.

78
00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:20.000
So if you know where to find public data about your industry go there check it out.

79
00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.500
Look for trends and make some observations.

80
00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:28.080
Lots of media outlets and major industry blogs do recaps of the end of a calendar year or even a quarter

81
00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.350
and predictions at the beginning of each period.

82
00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:39.240
So do a search for 10:16 16 trends or 2017 predictions or whatever year you're watching this in 2017

83
00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.000
2019.

84
00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:47.310
And that phrase with your specific topic as part of your search something like Customer Support 2016

85
00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.370
trends or mobile app design 2017 predictions.

86
00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:57.750
You should find plenty of posts within those posts you might find charts and data and maybe even links

87
00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.790
to the same sources of that data OK you got it.

88
00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:06.640
So that is an industry trends post that we got some inspiration or something we could write about and

89
00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.210
I talked a little bit about how we could do it ourselves.

90
00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:10.230
Let's look at something else.

91
00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:14.190
Now I'll go back to that support blog page and here's something interesting.

92
00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:14.980
Help desk.

93
00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:16.430
Tip number 12.

94
00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:21.610
Save time from saved replies from the title you can tell us is a series they write.

95
00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:27.070
Basically it's a tips and tricks post which is another common topic anyone can use.

96
00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:31.390
I did some digging before I made this video and looked through some of the other tips in the series

97
00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:33.190
and I like what they've done.

98
00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:35.190
Each post in the series is short.

99
00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:41.110
Just a few hundred words and it's hyper focused and only includes a few specific steps or details that

100
00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:43.070
you need to explain one thing.

101
00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:47.920
One of the keys for help Skow is that they try to offer a tip that involves their app.

102
00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:53.530
It's not just relevant to general support people but especially for help scout customers.

103
00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:58.360
If you're not one of them and you liked this tip well it's more likely that you'll sign up or at least

104
00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:59.830
try out their service.

105
00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:03.530
So how can you adopt the tips and tricks topic for yourself.

106
00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:09.430
Well a lot of times tips and tricks are nothing more than just a set of steps to follow and that's okay

107
00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:13.150
because you want to create something easy to understand and use.

108
00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:17.600
Like if you owned a car you don't want to know how to build the entire engine.

109
00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:21.190
You just want simple basic tuneups or tweaks to keep it running.

110
00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:21.650
Awesome.

111
00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:23.500
So for the industry your readers are in.

112
00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:27.410
What are those two dumps or tweaks that they would want to know about.

113
00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:30.940
What are some common steps they have to repeat to get work done.

114
00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:34.900
One way you can identify some tips is to look at a big group of tips.

115
00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:40.160
Remember the ultimate guide to being this or doing that that we discussed before.

116
00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:46.240
Well you could pick apart an ultimate guide right about each individual piece of it and you probably

117
00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:51.100
end up with like a dozen posts or like help scout a series of posts.

118
00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:56.500
So go to Google and just search for customer support ultimate guide or whatever your industry is.

119
00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:00.390
Plus ultimate guide and you can see what other people have come up with.

120
00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:03.150
It's another shortcut to just finding something to write about.

121
00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:08.480
I'm going to do a search for customer support ultimate guide and oh look at that groove HQ is back.

122
00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:11.360
Ultimate Guide to customer support training.

123
00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:12.250
Let's check that one out.

124
00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:17.150
Use these tips to turn new hires and seasoned pros alike into masters of support.

125
00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:21.370
Perfect a collection of tips you can pick any one of them.

126
00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:27.080
Offer your own take on it and publish it as a tips and tricks post or sweet.

127
00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:28.490
OK that's tips and tricks.

128
00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:33.670
I would have find one more content topic and that means we're going back to the help scout support blog.

129
00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:40.770
Both of our ideas so far come from them so we're going to ride that hot hand right on through here okay.

130
00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:45.850
Right at the top you see how to communicate with customers during an outage.

131
00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:47.490
Let's click through on that.

132
00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:48.720
That's piqued my interest.

133
00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:49.460
OK.

134
00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:55.800
For customer service teams outages are both a tough day at the office and an opportunity to stand out.

135
00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:57.170
This is very true.

136
00:07:57.190 --> 00:08:00.230
I'm just going to scroll through this so you can see what's here.

137
00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:02.300
There's a video conversation at the top.

138
00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:06.060
There are some elements of great outage communication.

139
00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:11.950
There's a listicle of guidelines for writing great status updates and there's an example of an outage

140
00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:13.360
update language.

141
00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:13.850
Nice.

142
00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:14.260
OK.

143
00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:19.450
So there is a lot of info here for people who sometimes have to deal with outages that convenes their

144
00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:20.460
customers.

145
00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:25.120
What I personally like is that it's all choked up into different formats.

146
00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:30.540
You see we have video we have bullets we have listicle and some other different types of examples.

147
00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:35.770
It makes it a little more interesting to go through and no doubt the customers and the people reading

148
00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:37.420
it probably knows the same thing.

149
00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:43.890
So this is an example of a crisis management post and that is a topic that's relevant to almost everyone

150
00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:45.610
if you actually think about it now.

151
00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:52.270
Crisis might sound like something super serious something like a panicky type word but really all it's

152
00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:59.230
referring to is a problem that unexpectedly impacts a group of customers when a product breaks for instance.

153
00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:01.320
Customers will be inconvenienced.

154
00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:04.940
A Web site could get hacked or have a security breach.

155
00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:07.020
Your app could launch with a bug.

156
00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:08.830
So when something happens.

157
00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:15.520
Customer reactions could range anywhere from mildly annoyed to Pitchfork level rage whatever it is you

158
00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:16.470
need to deal with it.

159
00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:21.580
And that's why hey this is a contant opportunity to help SCO is giving advice to support people so they

160
00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:23.530
can deal with their own customers.

161
00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:28.150
Well what kind of crisis management advice could you potentially offer.

162
00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:33.730
What in your business or your industry could potentially go wrong in an unexpected way.

163
00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:38.620
Remember the crisis in question does it need to be a nuclear warhead headed towards your city.

164
00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:45.040
We're talking about like when websites go down unexpectedly when your phone dies or maybe you're a wrestler

165
00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:46.720
and you've run out of steel chairs.

166
00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:50.560
Lowe's Home Improvement has written posts about how to fix and repair things.

167
00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:55.420
They can certainly qualify as a crisis if you provide support to small businesses.

168
00:09:55.420 --> 00:10:01.690
You can and share tips on what they can do when they lose power or how void it with a generator or other

169
00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:03.910
backup system if you have your own app.

170
00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:08.740
What happens when a customer loses their phone and then needs to re-install the app.

171
00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:16.540
Or what if the app unexpectedly gets deleted or in the case of the new Apple update X. It's not unexpected

172
00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:19.090
or accidental that they deleted they deleted on purpose.

173
00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:24.010
What happens when they do that these crisis posts can be a way to ease their mind especially if it's

174
00:10:24.010 --> 00:10:26.140
a very fixable problem.

175
00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:29.760
You know what's a good format for dealing with a crisis.

176
00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:35.240
A checklist when people are stressed out giving them some structure to follow can really help them out.

177
00:10:35.290 --> 00:10:39.680
Don't make them think too much because in a crisis nobody can think straight.

178
00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:42.620
They just want the answer to their problem.

179
00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:43.930
Now the server is down.

180
00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:45.090
What do we do.

181
00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:46.870
Follow these five steps.

182
00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:47.930
Get it back online.

183
00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:49.530
Oh it's fixed great.

184
00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:51.180
Let's go back to working.

185
00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:52.330
Also known as ping pong.

186
00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:53.490
Help them prepare for the worst.

187
00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:57.070
Or if they're dealing with the crisis now tell them what they need to hear.

188
00:10:57.070 --> 00:10:58.750
All right so there is crisis management.

189
00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:00.420
And we also cover tips and tricks.

190
00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:04.920
And before that we talked to industry trends these topics are really universal.

191
00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:09.910
But if you need a couple more topic ideas you could also just write about your company write about your

192
00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:15.820
culture write about your people your history the problem you want to solve or publish your manifesto

193
00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:21.100
on how remote teams are becoming the future of work like dopes Scout actually did writing about your

194
00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:24.370
company is nice because you're not writing about what you're selling.

195
00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:30.040
And again this is a way that content can be more personal and it lets your customers kind of put their

196
00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:35.200
guard down and trust you or you can write about your customers or clients share great story about a

197
00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:35.760
customer.

198
00:11:35.770 --> 00:11:41.440
A funny lesson you learn through support or share some general data and explains who your customers

199
00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:44.400
are instead of writing about yourself or your product.

200
00:11:44.530 --> 00:11:49.750
You're sharing information about what you've learned through your interactions with your customers.

201
00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:54.580
It's another way to show your personality and that you actually care about working with and helping

202
00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:56.710
people who are paying for your stuff.

203
00:11:56.710 --> 00:12:00.910
All right so you've got five topics right there that you can potentially research and use for your own

204
00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:01.360
site.

205
00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:04.270
There are certainly way more topics out there.

206
00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:10.550
We just got five just by looking at someone's blog and saying hey we could use that topic as well.

207
00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:15.880
You could do that almost with any well-done blog if you're really stuck for ideas.

208
00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:17.630
Also just one last thing.

209
00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:20.830
There are a few content idea generators out there.

210
00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:25.000
They're basically like little forms that you can plug a topic into and it'll spit out ideas for blog

211
00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.430
post titles than the titles kind of give you an idea of what to write about.

212
00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:33.820
Now they're are going to write the article for you and they're not going to replace all of the human

213
00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:36.760
creativity you require but they will give you some inspiration.

214
00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:37.880
Now one of them is called Port.

215
00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:40.260
Its content idea generator.

216
00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:41.020
We'll link to it.

217
00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:42.580
Here are the resources.

218
00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:43.350
Check it out.

219
00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:44.020
It's kind of cool.

220
00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:45.800
We can actually look at it real quick.

221
00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:49.050
So when you land on the Web site you just plug in your topic.

222
00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:51.990
What's your category while and you just plug that in here.

223
00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:57.040
I'll just pretend that i'm help scout and I'll plug in customer support because that's my that's my

224
00:12:57.210 --> 00:12:57.890
my topic.

225
00:12:57.910 --> 00:13:00.210
So you're going to see a blog post title.

226
00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:04.690
It's kind of like a slot machine type thing where you can just keep hitting refresh and a new combo

227
00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:05.850
will appear each time.

228
00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:12.100
And well maybe customer support doesn't actually make sense but if you get the point some of it will

229
00:13:12.130 --> 00:13:14.290
absolutely be terrible.

230
00:13:14.290 --> 00:13:19.270
And I'm just going to keep hitting refresh over and over here until I find something that might kind

231
00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:20.640
of get my mind moving.

232
00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:21.430
OK here we go.

233
00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:24.580
This one is kind of interesting how customer support can help you predict the future.

234
00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:28.810
You know I don't actually know where you go with that but if you could write something for it I think

235
00:13:28.810 --> 00:13:29.820
would be kind of interesting.

236
00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:31.690
You know if I were to write a post on that.

237
00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:37.420
Well you know I bet I probably end up doing is customer support if that's your topic and that's what

238
00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:38.630
you really specialize in.

239
00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:41.710
Well they might get requests from users for features.

240
00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:42.160
Right.

241
00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:47.740
And some of those are things you might be able to implement in the future because of support also might

242
00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:51.230
get messages about things competitors offer that you don't.

243
00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:57.610
So you can decide to make changes and support messages might also give you ideas on new products to

244
00:13:57.610 --> 00:13:59.830
pair with your existing product.

245
00:13:59.830 --> 00:14:04.630
So this title could actually turn into a post or maybe it leads to something else but you know the title

246
00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:11.140
got me thinking you could you could write about that using feedback to inform your product roadmap going

247
00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:11.750
forward.

248
00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:17.350
Okay so I wouldn't obviously start with this tool but this is more of you know I've got a total brain

249
00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:20.050
lock type situation I need ideas really quickly.

250
00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:24.580
OK so there you go five topics you can try out with straight industry trends tips and tricks crisis

251
00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:30.250
management you can write about your company and you can write about your customers or your clients if

252
00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:34.960
you need more ideas than just go look at a blog that's in your space or even remotely similar or just

253
00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:37.460
one that you respect and see what else they write about.

254
00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:39.430
Just ask yourself Could I write about that.

255
00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:40.500
But for my industry.

256
00:14:40.510 --> 00:14:43.720
All right guys so get out there and do some research and I'll see you in the next lecture.
