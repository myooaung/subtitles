00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.240
Hey guys welcome back to the chorus.

2
00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.830
So in the last couple of lectures we covered popular content types and we talked about content that

3
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.800
answers questions and content taking the form of lists this time around let's discuss popular content

4
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.710
types that are used to help us tell stories.

5
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:23.100
Storytelling has become a widely used tactic in content marketing because stories convey a deeper meaning

6
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.710
than any headline or tweet could do on its own by using stories.

7
00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:33.960
You can set up scenarios you can explain how your product or business got involved or solved the problem

8
00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:38.160
and share the outcome from a satisfied customers point of view.

9
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:44.070
You can also use images and videos along with data and quotes and provide a total picture of how and

10
00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.070
why everything came together and worked.

11
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:54.660
People have reluctance buying things so why not show them the entire process and the happy ending outcome

12
00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.950
without having them do anything but read with their eyeballs.

13
00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.620
In this lecture lets discuss some storytelling content types.

14
00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.620
The three types will cover our number one company stories.

15
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.460
Number two case studies and number three infographics.

16
00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.600
Now when I mention company stories maybe the first thing you think of are those paragraphs you wrote

17
00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.900
for the About Us page or the about the company page of your website.

18
00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.000
Well Company stories are much more than that.

19
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:25.920
They dig into the reasons why a company was started the mission it hopes to achieve and the customers

20
00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:29.820
out there hopes to help and support long into the future.

21
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.130
Company stories go beyond where or where you started your business.

22
00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.700
What's right about why you started it.

23
00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.470
Why did you make your first prototype of your product or app.

24
00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.500
What problem are you trying to solve.

25
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.630
Did you have an idea you needed to share with the world.

26
00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:48.710
Origins stories can be really interesting because many of us can identify with them.

27
00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.560
We talk about how we started from the very beginning.

28
00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.720
A lot of people reading it have not started a company or have not started a path to solving this problem

29
00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:58.300
so they are also at the beginning.

30
00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.860
It's very easy for them to connect now beyond your origin story.

31
00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.680
You can also write about who's on your team now.

32
00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.000
What makes them special.

33
00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.200
What's the deal with your new office.

34
00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.130
Why are you supporting this charity you keep talking about.

35
00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.000
Now you might wonder why would customers care about any of this type of stuff.

36
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.740
Shouldn't we be focusing on the business and the product.

37
00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.280
Well yes but here's the benefit.

38
00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:26.220
Giving them an inside look into the company or the people or your story can help make companies more

39
00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.550
approachable and more trustworthy.

40
00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.470
It also helps you share your culture and your mission with them.

41
00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.270
For customers it makes it look less like a faceless monolith and more like someone they might want to

42
00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.990
connect with.

43
00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.580
But let's not forget those customers because companies stories can also be about them.

44
00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.660
Showcasing the great work your clients have done with your help is another way to prove your worth.

45
00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.350
We stea for instance has a whole section on its site called Video inspiration.

46
00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.640
It's full of examples from their clients.

47
00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.800
In fact they're kind of like mini case studies describing you know like who the clients are and how

48
00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.690
they use with these services.

49
00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:06.810
So companies stories are a great opportunity for you to pull back the curtain and give people look at

50
00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.380
who you are and why you do what you do as a business.

51
00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:11.250
It's worth doing.

52
00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:12.410
It creates a connection.

53
00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.010
And guess what it's really easy to do because everybody knows their story.

54
00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:21.750
You don't have to write like Shakespeare or Hemingway just write like how you remember it and then just

55
00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.010
edit it for typos.

56
00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.750
Now another kind of story that you can do is the second one I want to talk about which are case studies

57
00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:33.270
now case studies in my opinion are excellent content types especially if you're an agency or a service

58
00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:39.390
provider you guys should definitely pay attention to this one if I just described you if you have customers

59
00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:43.790
who have used your product or service successfully and I know this doesn't describe everybody out there

60
00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.980
well then you have you have a story that you can tell.

61
00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:52.110
And of course this is a Siegman they give you permission to use their name to make sure that you get

62
00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.880
their permission.

63
00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.980
And in fact many people will be flattered that you even asked.

64
00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:00.600
Usually the sell on a case study is pretty simple you just explain to them that it gives them exposure

65
00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:06.210
and it highlights your product and how it works so it's usually a win win once you get there at that

66
00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.520
point.

67
00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:09.580
Just tell a story of why the customer saw you out.

68
00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.040
What was their problem.

69
00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:16.080
What are the problem actually look like in terms of numbers or how it affected their operations on a

70
00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.330
day to day basis.

71
00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.950
Why did they then pick you over other competitors.

72
00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:25.500
Talk about how the implementation went or how they started using whatever you make if you can get data

73
00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:32.550
like productivity went up 500 percent or we reduce expenses by 25 percent in the first month for this

74
00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:33.320
company.

75
00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:39.870
Then you can really make a strong case to other people as to why you should look into your product or

76
00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:40.520
service.

77
00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:46.320
Here's an example the University of Chicago inconveniently nicknamed where fun goes to die.

78
00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:52.500
They have a news office and their news office was using an older version of Drupal the power of their

79
00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.130
Web sites but they badly needed to update everything.

80
00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:00.700
Drupal if you don't know it's basically like Word Press it's like Wordpress.

81
00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:08.660
But as a smaller group of developers and group of people supporting it but the people that are for Drupal

82
00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:15.050
are pretty intensely for Drupal it's kind of cold like anyway by working with project managers at Drupal

83
00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:20.720
uteri Chicago's NEWSROOM was able to improve the design and speed of their Web sites and make it all

84
00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:21.690
mobile friendly.

85
00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:27.040
Drupal then shares many fine details about the entire process and a case study on its site.

86
00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:32.810
It includes you Chicago's needs their goals for the upgrade Drupal process making it happen and why

87
00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:33.400
it all work.

88
00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:39.050
So if you were part of a similar kind of organization looking to update your content management system

89
00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:43.180
you might be comparing Drupal and say WordPress as possible solutions.

90
00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:49.430
Therefore reading Drupal in-depth case study about Chicago project could make you more confident in

91
00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:55.250
them as an option or at least helps kind of visualize walking through the process with case studies.

92
00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:59.720
Not only can you convince people considering your service but you can also attract people interested

93
00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:00.740
in proving themselves.

94
00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:06.350
In general case studies can be really powerful because unlike a lot of other marketing stuff you might

95
00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:07.400
see or read.

96
00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:09.210
This actually worked out.

97
00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:11.340
These are actual results you can share.

98
00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:16.040
When people decide to purchase your product or plead their case to a manager or someone writing the

99
00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:21.150
checks case studies can go a long way towards actually closing the deal.

100
00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:24.760
So weve talked about companies stories and weve all sort of a case study.

101
00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:30.890
So for a lot of times those stories get told using written accounts perhaps some data or maybe some

102
00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:32.420
great videos if you're lucky.

103
00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:37.310
But another way to tell stories that some people forget about is through an info graphic and that's

104
00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:38.970
the last one to discuss in this lecture.

105
00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:45.400
Infographics come in many shapes sizes and forms and I'm Karen t you seen probably 100 of them.

106
00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:52.550
The idea is to graphically tell a story in a visually engaging way usually by using a long vertical

107
00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:53.380
image.

108
00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:57.770
Sometimes you'll even find infographics with other content types embedded in it.

109
00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:01.580
Here's an example from a company called Visual the you can take a guess.

110
00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:04.670
They have a software that helps you make infographics.

111
00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:07.780
OK now look at that one yeah it's kind of intense.

112
00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:12.860
It's like a listicle inside of an info graphic content inception with an info graphic.

113
00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:17.800
You can combine interesting numbers or data with explanations about what the data means.

114
00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:23.030
It could mean graphing it all out show a trend or it could mean putting items in order to help the reader

115
00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:25.050
understand the steps of a process.

116
00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:30.530
Infographics catch people's attention because they look interesting but they ultimately get shared because

117
00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:32.130
of the value they provide.

118
00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:37.810
For example Quick Books is a company that provides accounting software and apps and part of their audience

119
00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:39.570
is small businesses.

120
00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:40.160
Go figure.

121
00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:45.440
They created a nympho graphic about crowdfunding a topic small business owners might be interested in

122
00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:47.810
and probably don't know a whole lot about.

123
00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:51.320
The graphic uses visuals to quickly explain how it works.

124
00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:56.660
The pros and cons and then it wraps up with a table comparing seven different services giving the reader

125
00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:59.780
detail on how each one could meet their needs.

126
00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:03.890
Pretty much everything you'd need to know if you're like hey I need to know about crowdfunding.

127
00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:08.430
So how can you the person sitting at home make an info graphic for your business.

128
00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:12.870
Well the process of creating one is pretty similar to just running a blog post.

129
00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:19.140
You want to tell a story and share valuable instead of just using tax you'll rely heavily on visuals

130
00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:25.850
which could be maps it could be icons can be pictures it could be charts just like a blog post it helps

131
00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:27.490
to start out with an outline.

132
00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:32.780
Stepping the reader through important concepts or interesting points but like many infographics.

133
00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:38.950
Don't be afraid to put in cool call outs to things like pro tips or did you know type stuff.

134
00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:42.280
Ok but how do we actually make them.

135
00:08:42.290 --> 00:08:48.410
We know that you make an outline and an outline you list out your points that kind of tell a story.

136
00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:54.170
Then you polish those points build those points out and secondarily and in call outs or prototypes are

137
00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:58.350
things that are kind of tangential to the story narrative you're telling.

138
00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:03.230
Ok but how do we actually put those together what often is that you can work with a designer if you

139
00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:04.120
have the budget.

140
00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:09.290
But you can also do more and kind of DIY ways of tackling it.

141
00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:09.980
You can try.

142
00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:15.240
Free tools like Kanva which they have a whole bunch of templates that you can just start with.

143
00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:17.210
It's just Kanva dot com it's free.

144
00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:21.010
Or you can find an artist on something like five or dot com.

145
00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:25.360
We've mentioned five or probably 100 times to this point that's in other places tons of people who are

146
00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:26.720
specialized in infographics.

147
00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:32.260
You just give them the outline and pay them anywhere from five dollars to $500.

148
00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:34.350
They'll get a an info graphic.

149
00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:35.240
Really that's it.

150
00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:39.290
I can't really go into more detail about how he would design it because at the end of the day you're

151
00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:43.910
not going to design it unless you are a designer in which case why are you asking the question how do

152
00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:45.340
I make infographics.

153
00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:51.350
You have the tools yourself the option for us non designers is probably going to be hiring someone using

154
00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:58.130
a service site like fiber or using tools ourselves like Kanva or like visually or if you don't like

155
00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:03.020
visually you can also use call info graphic making software there's a lot of them are that's three different

156
00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:06.790
content types that can really help you tell great stories of the company story.

157
00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:13.520
Case studies I mean infographics each one has its own benefits so make sure you consider each one.

158
00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:14.540
All right so in the next letter.
