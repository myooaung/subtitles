00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,670
Hazor Welcome back and we've been talking about how to create a landing page.

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:06,930
Last actually took us through the basics of what you need to prepare and create.

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:11,100
Now I want to take you through a solution that could be useful for a lot of landing page needs you might

4
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:14,160
have to actually create the landing page.

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,370
You either need web design and development skills or you can go the easy route.

6
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:21,840
Pretty much everybody does and use an online tool and there's a lot of it.

7
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:24,430
There's a bunch of landing page solutions out there.

8
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:28,800
Now two of the good ones I've seen are on bounce and lead pages.

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,210
Now there's a lot of them out there and everybody kind of has their own preference.

10
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:40,050
You guys come from the MVP course where we used launch rock n Alternatively use Kickoff labs but then

11
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:44,040
we use insta page launch for our kickoff labs are really simple pages.

12
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,680
They don't give you a lot of control and it's not generally something I would use for a webinars or

13
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,320
a lead magnet you want to do something a little more robust insta page.

14
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,280
It's kind of expensive.

15
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:57,030
It's like $70 a month but it pretty much gives you all the tools you need.

16
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:59,280
Any idiot can put together one of these pages.

17
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,680
There are other ones of course there's like and bounce and there's lead pages.

18
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:04,750
I believe they both have 30 day trials.

19
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:09,280
I think they're both kind of the same thing that and like the 70 or 100 dollars a month range.

20
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:15,360
And there's also lander which is a 14 day trial but they have a smaller feature set and at the end of

21
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,140
the day I think they're a little bit cheaper.

22
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:20,650
Lander's easy if you don't need to do anything super complex.

23
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:25,530
What general advice though is just look at their templates instead to see if you like what the templates

24
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:30,060
are and then you know check out their videos and demos to see how easy the interface looks and then

25
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,760
just consider the specific needs you have.

26
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,510
They're all pretty much the same thing.

27
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:39,580
They might all have different techniques for doing the same stuff.

28
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:43,890
So just look at the template to see which ones you like the best and see which one things is the most

29
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:45,090
straightforward.

30
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:49,170
If you have a lot of time to spend old and tackle unbalances the most complicated one.

31
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:53,610
But if you aren't trying to make something super complicated and maybe you just use lander on any page

32
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:57,690
platform like these generally makes sense for promoting an e-book or white paper because you can you

33
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:00,660
know send an email to whoever signs up at the link to the document they want.

34
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:01,790
Really easy to do.

35
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,630
Promoting a seminar you might consider using the registration features inside whatever platform you're

36
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:12,020
going to use to do the web or like any meeting is a good one or zoom as another example for e-mail of

37
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:18,330
course courses you should probably look at autoresponder features from places maybe like a Weber which

38
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:21,920
is one of the ones I've seen recommended the most for e-mail courses.

39
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:23,370
Those are the most straightforward.

40
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:29,220
I mean you can also do it with like MailChimp and pretty much any other email marketing tool.

41
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:33,690
Personally I like a lever whatever solution you use at some point you'll probably have to design your

42
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:34,460
landing page.

43
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:39,090
So since we are symbol all of that copying important info from the last lecture while we're in decent

44
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:40,850
shape really now is just putting it together.

45
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:47,120
So it's a landing page solution to try and I'm going to pick lander which doesn't require a credit card.

46
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:50,430
And like I said it's the easiest one to get in and get out of.

47
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:55,160
So go to the lander app dot com and just click the try lander for free button below.

48
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:59,140
Enter your name email phone and create a password if you guys only want to do that.

49
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:06,520
You can use companies like privacy or a buying tool called blur.

50
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:10,180
And what these can do can give you fake email addresses.

51
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:12,180
The zone called throttle.

52
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:17,760
They give you auto venerated email addresses so that you can unsubscribe very easily to the emails they

53
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,210
send to you and you don't have to give out your actual e-mail case you're afraid of it being sold.

54
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:22,170
Anyway check those out.

55
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:25,960
Throttle privacy and Ablin are ones that you won't want to check out.

56
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:29,930
They'll send you an activation email that all you do is just click on that link in the e-mail.

57
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:34,320
Now back on the site well you'll need to choose a folder name for all your landing pages so just put

58
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:39,020
I don't know what your business name then click the new landing page icon up on the left.

59
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:43,920
So we'll just jump in here with the landing page using info we put together in our last lecture.

60
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,300
We'll give our new page a name I'll call mine.

61
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:48,940
Oh how to design a great logo ebook.

62
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:50,270
Then click next.

63
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,610
Now we'll see a whole bunch of templates you can use.

64
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:55,770
Now the simple categories are pretty much made for exactly what we're doing.

65
00:03:55,770 --> 00:04:00,900
We have one called webinars and events which is going to come in pretty handy or we don't have ones

66
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:05,970
like products and services and that's that's probably what I'm going to use for my ebook webinars are

67
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:08,080
made specifically for webinars.

68
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,410
My thing is technically a product go product.

69
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:14,580
Now you try to find something similar to what you roughed up in your document but browse through and

70
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:15,520
see what you like.

71
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:20,700
The way I do it is I just look for which one looks the closest the way I see it in my head and that's

72
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:21,220
how I figure.

73
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:21,540
OK.

74
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:25,800
Well this one's willing to take five steps to get to where I want as opposed to this one which would

75
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,610
take a lot of modification of the colors and images and text and things like that.

76
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,320
But keep that in mind.

77
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:34,100
You can change colors images and fonts and really do whatever you want.

78
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:35,370
So it's really up to you.

79
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:38,910
So you know I'm just you know she is the first template here which I can preview by clicking the double

80
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:41,070
arrow button in the upper right corner.

81
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:45,270
Looks good also like that template and it the create button in the lower right and it takes me to the

82
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:45,990
Editor page.

83
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,640
Now you've got a lot of flexibility here.

84
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:51,740
You want to change anything just double click it you mess anything up all there is an undo button.

85
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:55,870
Looks like an arrow pointing left and it's in the upper left corner.

86
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:58,130
Now every landing page platform is going to be different.

87
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:01,090
But generally I think you'll find they a lot like this.

88
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:02,790
So let's put this to work.

89
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:06,870
Let's open up a Google doc or wherever that information input is and let's just copy and paste everything

90
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:10,010
into the roughly the appropriate spots.

91
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:14,520
First I'll copy my headline go back to Landauer to look look the headline into the template and then

92
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:17,280
paste in the text window that shows up below.

93
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,230
Now you might have to play with the fonts and sizes.

94
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:19,870
Get it right.

95
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:26,770
But that's basically the process does take some tweaking because they have bugs but they all have bugs.

96
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,300
But OK I see that another ten minutes.

97
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:33,300
Anyway once you start working on the template you might decide some things aren't needed on the page.

98
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,210
One of the first things I do is I just start deleting sections I don't want.

99
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:39,070
Now you can easily click the X box to get rid of that section.

100
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:41,270
Maybe you'll see a trash icon.

101
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:43,910
Other design platforms is usually kind of the same thing as you get it.

102
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,510
You might have to move some things around so they fit.

103
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:48,960
You can also drag and drop items from the toolbar on the right.

104
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:52,020
Explore it a bit and you'll see it's got some nice features.

105
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:56,670
One of those things is your form which you can find under the advanced part of the toolbar on the right

106
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,560
so click and drag that over.

107
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:02,890
And for our forum we're asking for a name and email you just check off the fields you want.

108
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:05,720
You can change what the button says you can change the color.

109
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:06,850
It's really up to you.

110
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:09,060
Just remember to make your form button nice and bright.

111
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:14,100
Remember that people don't miss it as you're editing click the save button in the upper left at any

112
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,450
time to save your progress.

113
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:17,280
I don't think Lander automatically does it.

114
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,450
Some of them automatically do it.

115
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:23,400
Insta page does not say if you exit out you are screwed anyway so once you're happy with what you have

116
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:27,290
hit that preview button to check out what it's going to look like.

117
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,950
This is of course after some finagling and some moving around but if you did all the stuff in your google

118
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:33,130
doc first really you just plug and play.

119
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:35,520
Now the page should come up and you'll see what it looks like.

120
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:38,880
If you're ready to launch this thing then just click Finish in the upper right and then you'll have

121
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,350
the landing page dashboard.

122
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:42,780
You'll see the name of your page and that you are aware of will be.

123
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:46,860
Now lender allows you to change your L if you want so you can use your own domain.

124
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:51,420
I strongly suggest generally it looks kind of weird when it's the name of your company.

125
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,150
Daut need pages of COM.

126
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,420
It kind of looks a little easy.

127
00:06:54,600 --> 00:07:00,600
Although some marketing companies will do that because they just seem all the people setting up Erny

128
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,920
know what lead pages is.

129
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,230
I just suggest make your own.

130
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,350
Just make your own domain.

131
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,360
Now I've already have a domain you can just do it from your domain.

132
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:10,820
Slash the name of a landing page or you can go buy a new domain for this.

133
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:13,370
I generally go with the second but it's really up to you.

134
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:17,280
So on the dashboards page the most important feature that you can hit is it going to the published bottom

135
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,460
to the top to make that page live.

136
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:23,200
So click the arrow next to the publish button to see your live page.

137
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:28,140
Olah again many landing page platforms have similar features but the basic process I shared with you

138
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:30,170
really works the best.

139
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:36,000
Prepare all that information first completely agnostic of the design know what copy and images you want

140
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,960
to use what details you need to have prepare and then just use a template and a design feature inside

141
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,070
the landing page provided to make everything fit.

142
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:50,010
I don't generally like to change these pages a ton because they put a lot of research into their templates

143
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:52,580
so they know these templates work.

144
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:57,390
The more you screw with that the farther you kind of move away from the proven science.

145
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:01,290
Now once you've got a design you like or view your page before you launch it just remember our tips

146
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:05,700
from the earlier lectures about making sure your page is clear providing all the details your visitors

147
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:06,370
will need.

148
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:09,020
Making your form friendly and your call to action obvious.

149
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:12,850
I generally like to go through a checklist and just look through it.

150
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:14,990
The color action is easy to find.

151
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:18,560
It's immediately obvious what this is does it match my aunt as my headline.

152
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,380
Immediately explain what the value of the magnet is.

153
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:26,440
Now after you launch your landing page make sure to watch the stats you get how well is your page converting.

154
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:31,230
Now you might decide to test out an alternate design such as a page with a different headline for example.

155
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:36,210
No landing page software let you do what are called split tests or Abts where you can see which works

156
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:37,860
best you can get more leads.

157
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:42,810
The general process behind that is let's say you made a page you launch it and you don't like the conversion

158
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:46,380
rate so you might go back and let's say you changed the headline.

159
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:49,920
Make that a separate A-B test run it and then see which one tests better.

160
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:50,780
The one that test better.

161
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:51,490
Well there you go.

162
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:56,160
Now you have a better headline then what you can do is systematically go and start editing more and

163
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,080
more things.

164
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:02,910
Generally speaking try to only change one major thing at a time you change two things and it improves

165
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,150
or gets worse.

166
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,250
You don't know which one caused it anyway so there you go.

167
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:11,440
Now that we've discussed how to create landing pages Let's discuss some of the different lead magnets

168
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:16,950
you can create to generate that interest and those leads will start that discussion in the next lecture.

169
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:17,540
I'll see you then.
