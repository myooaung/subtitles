00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.440
Hey guys welcome back to the chorus.

2
00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:07.140
All right so in the last few videos we looked at different places like Bus sumo and like Google to find

3
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.700
inspiration for content ideas.

4
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.930
Now the idea is that some of these platforms have sort of like hidden places where you can spot trends.

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.980
Well one place that puts those trends front and center hard at all to find is Twitter.

6
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.080
So let's take a quick look at Twitter because this can actually be helpful for creating content that's

7
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.410
timely and can get people that will actually engage with it.

8
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.900
Not Twitter trends is a special section on the platform that shows the kind of like the top 10 list

9
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:40.440
of the day of topics hashtags and other notable events or items on Twitter dot com you'll see the list

10
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.940
on the left side of the screen on your mobile app.

11
00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:48.690
Well you need to look and I think it's the Explorer screen for it instead what you see is usually specific

12
00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.100
to the location you're at now.

13
00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:55.680
No matter where you are though chances are you'll see a lot of topics that have to do with politics

14
00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.120
from a business standpoint.

15
00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:03.140
Now it's usually a great idea to stay as far away as possible from political issues and topic.

16
00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.730
Try to stay focused on what you're trying to accomplish on Twitter.

17
00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:09.430
And that is meeting and having conversations with people.

18
00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.570
Very rarely do political conversations get you there.

19
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.130
Your chances of doing this are just generally much better when you don't have a controversial subject

20
00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.030
matter to deal with.

21
00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.200
Right off the bat look at the list but ignore the political ones.

22
00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.610
OK.

23
00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.220
Beyond the political stuff you see on Twitter you see a wide range of other trending topics that could

24
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:32.070
touch on pop culture type things like you know the TV show that's airing its season finale right now.

25
00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.750
It can be some sports ball event specially if it's your local sports ball team.

26
00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.010
It might even be a hashtag where people are trying to come up with the funniest answer coolest content

27
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.680
or just trying to get involved in some way of the Twitter conversation.

28
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.680
I shared this pic on Throwback Thursday when I could have saved it for Flashback Friday.

29
00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:50.610
Whatever.

30
00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:52.160
Hashtag sorry not sorry.

31
00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:57.150
As a company you can certainly jump in and participate a great thing about doing this is that you actually

32
00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:02.850
can show you have some personality some companies show they're not just big faceless organizations and

33
00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.500
that they're actually human beings in there somewhere.

34
00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.220
It can really help the perception of who they are when they do it correctly.

35
00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:14.310
Hey look at this funny tweet there not just in it for the money they want to have fun too.

36
00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.170
Now some older companies have done a cool job like the throwback Thursday hash tag for instance and

37
00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.870
share pictures from years way in the past.

38
00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.630
And cool example Land Rover shared this picture.

39
00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.340
It's from 1972.

40
00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.530
American Express combined a picture of a car from 58 and the one from today.

41
00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.280
Nostalgia can be pretty cool and if you have some early screenshots of your app or I don't know retro

42
00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.680
photos from your company's first office assuming that you've been around for a while or hey even embarrassing

43
00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.880
high school yearbook photos it might be cool to share it and show an interesting behind the scenes look

44
00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:45.700
at who you are.

45
00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.290
So Tom it's like Throwback Thursday happen all the time.

46
00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.140
But what about the topics that are actually new.

47
00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.290
How can you pick up on the right Twitter trends and use them to create some tweets of your own.

48
00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.490
First look at the list and try to see if any of the topics are obviously relevant to you.

49
00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.440
If nothing seems relevant that's fine.

50
00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.250
Hey the whole world isn't concerned with you and your company all the time.

51
00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.480
Get over yourself.

52
00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.280
This is pretty normal.

53
00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:08.460
But here's the scenario.

54
00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:14.160
OK maybe hash tag travel Tuesday is trending and you happen to make a productivity app.

55
00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:17.580
They don't seem obviously connected but give it some thought.

56
00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.120
Here in a blog post about how your users can use your app all traveling.

57
00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.500
If so you can actually tweet about it use that hash tag and share a link to your post.

58
00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:30.020
If you haven't written this blog post well here's a perfect excuse to do so.

59
00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.120
And if it's going to take you a week to write it that's fine.

60
00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.570
Guess what.

61
00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.740
Next Tuesday will be travel Tuesday again.

62
00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.620
Remember that your Trends list is specific to your location.

63
00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:44.190
So if you're trying to stay aware of what's happening in your local area let's say for example that

64
00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.230
your company is based in San Francisco.

65
00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.150
I don't know where I came of that idea.

66
00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.240
And hey look people are talking about hash tag Giants.

67
00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.630
That is the baseball team not giant beast like Godzilla.

68
00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.440
Yes our baseball teams the Giants I learned this yesterday.

69
00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.030
The baseball team is starting let's say spring training getting ready for another season to begin.

70
00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.740
OK so that's why people were talking about it.

71
00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.610
Now you may not know a baseball from a bass guitar but a quick scan of the tweets tells you that the

72
00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:10.640
local fans are excited about something.

73
00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.040
So as a local company you can wish the team luck on a new season.

74
00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:19.550
You can walk past the park OK and maybe taken nuber to the park and then snap a selfie.

75
00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.000
Taggett And there you go.

76
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.360
Shows some local spirit is one way to get noticed by local customers.

77
00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.190
Perhaps you can even do a quick promo.

78
00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:27.510
Spring training is here.

79
00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:31.140
Use Giants as a coupon code today and get free shipping on any order hash.

80
00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:32.040
I go Giants.

81
00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.980
Nobody is going to forget you are a company trying to make money of course.

82
00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:39.900
However when you stop promoting yourself 100 percent of the time and take some time to celebrate or

83
00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.820
discuss other things in the world that other people care about you as a company begin to appear more

84
00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.710
human and more approachable.

85
00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:48.320
Is that tweet promotional.

86
00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:52.250
Sure but it's also relevant to the world outside of your company.

87
00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:56.880
So search those Twitter trends and if you end up finding hashtags or topic that's giving you a lot of

88
00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:57.480
inspiration.

89
00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:04.030
Keep using it if you want to monitor at often use apps like TweetDeck dot com they can help you monitor

90
00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:06.870
topics more easily than like constantly searching.

91
00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:11.840
You can run TweetDeck in your browser go to TweetDeck com or you can do it on your phone too.

92
00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.380
Let's try it out just here for a second.

93
00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:18.340
We'll use the browser and we'll do a search for travel Tuesday that hashtag you can see the results

94
00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:22.870
and if you like it and after furter it again later you can click on that add column button and it will

always be available.

TweetDeck I believe is free now for all the same steps for the other search terms and topics you want

97
00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:32.530
