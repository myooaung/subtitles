1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:06,930
Hey guys welcome back to the chorus and the last actor we talked ad nauseum about the benefits of defining

2
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:07,720
your audience.

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:11,720
And there were a bunch of really good reasons why you should do this.

4
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,280
If I may say so myself.

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:18,250
So if we're going to define our audience well how exactly do we do that.

6
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:21,840
How do we determine who our ideal customer or client is.

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:27,190
Now your first thought might be well I want everyone to be my audience and OK.

8
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:27,610
Yeah.

9
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:31,420
There is a whole world of people out there and they all technically have money.

10
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:37,170
They could just as soon spend it on your app or service instead of shelling out money to go see another

11
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:44,190
comic book movie or buy a homemade pasta maker that they might use once and realize it's too difficult

12
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:44,730
to clean.

13
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:47,500
And then just store it in a cabinet for two years.

14
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:48,410
I've done it.

15
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,270
The people are willing to buy that crap then they'll buy your app right.

16
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,490
Well no not necessarily.

17
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:58,860
What's important here is not whether or not anyone can buy your product or service.

18
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:04,920
What's important is who would want to buy it who would use it who would pay for it.

19
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,470
Who would benefit from it.

20
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:10,530
Not only do these questions help you figure out who do want your product but they also help you figure

21
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:12,830
out who would want your content to.

22
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:17,320
Now it's OK to have a lot of questions here in fact but there's a really good thing.

23
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:22,370
The more questions you ask about your ideal audience the closer you can get to identifying them.

24
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:25,710
But we need to answer those questions somehow.

25
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:33,500
The bottom line is we need data we need real information in the form of numbers evidence responses anything

26
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,090
you get your hands on to help us paint this picture.

27
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:40,350
Well there are three types of data that we can use at the beginning.

28
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,700
Number one is geographic.

29
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:42,990
Number two is demographic.

30
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:44,830
Number three is psychographic.

31
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,660
It's a lot like a trilogy of movies that takes you deeper and deeper into the universe.

32
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:54,300
And by the end you'll understand the characters really well what they like and dislike what they do

33
00:01:54,300 --> 00:02:00,060
in certain situations and who you'd want to hang out with or who you probably just avoid geographic

34
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:00,480
data.

35
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:03,570
Now the first one of the three refers to location.

36
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:08,980
It can be country region city states street address you name it.

37
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:13,290
If we know where our customers are we can plan better ways of reaching them.

38
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:18,990
And more people like them with content they'll appreciate there are issues that might affect people

39
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:21,580
in specific regions that don't matter to others.

40
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:28,850
They could be related to technology whether travel the economy politics were a mix of all of these things.

41
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:34,440
For example if we discover most of our customers are located in the Bay Area of California like myself

42
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:40,320
it might make sense to do a live event or a meet up in San Francisco or if we can see we're getting

43
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:46,030
a lot of customers in England perhaps we'll do some marketing campaign specifically for people in London.

44
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:51,060
Sports teams often focus marketing efforts on their hometown and the surrounding areas and for good

45
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:51,840
reason.

46
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,960
Most of their fans are located nearby.

47
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:59,850
Does it make as much sense for the Oklahoma City Thunder basketball team to create content for say the

48
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:01,680
residents of Toronto Canada.

49
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,590
Now you can see the examples I mentioned as just a star.

50
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:09,450
They're not fully formed ideas yet and that's because geographic data is really only one part of what

51
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:10,980
we need to define our audience.

52
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:15,770
Now the second one was demographic data and it's another type of data that can help us define our audience

53
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:19,100
demographics referred to the basic ways that marketers are.

54
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:22,530
Many of them in other industries can define and group people.

55
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:30,600
They use things like age gender marital status household income education level language that they speak

56
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,560
and many more things like that.

57
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:38,130
And these might sound familiar if you've ever completed a survey online or a long registration form

58
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:41,940
for something you probably answered personal questions about these pieces of data.

59
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:47,550
Now it's not hard to see how this data comes in handy for example double HRP are.

60
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:54,230
Is a nonprofit group founded to benefit retired people and anyone over the age of 50 can be a member.

61
00:03:54,300 --> 00:04:01,350
So clearly art would create content for that specific age group and avoid probably writing blog posts

62
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:04,470
for millennials or teenagers for example.

63
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:05,590
Then there's.

64
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:08,520
Let's take for example Heal's dot com which.

65
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:09,690
You can guess what they sell.

66
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:11,680
They sell high heeled shoes for women.

67
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:17,970
So you can guess at their blog and video series focuses on issues most of their female customers care

68
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:24,240
about including the latest fashions shoe designs and other things I don't really know or don't read

69
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:24,540
it.

70
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:25,620
And that's also kind of the point.

71
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:29,060
I'm a guy so I'm probably not going to care about that stuff.

72
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:31,180
But for the people they're trying to target.

73
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:37,080
It works but demographic data also includes other details such as what kinds of devices people own and

74
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:43,350
use it might also define how they check their email or shop online what sites they visit and what apps

75
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:44,250
they use.

76
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:49,320
Knowing all of this gives you a lot more insight into who these people are that read your content and

77
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:54,450
buy your products data might tell us that those Oklahoma City Thunder fans I mentioned earlier might

78
00:04:54,450 --> 00:05:01,910
turn out to be mostly ages 25 to 39 mostly male and use use phones more often than any other device

79
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:03,440
the access the Internet.

80
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:09,050
This makes me wonder about what content we can create specifically for them based on who they are or

81
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:12,680
if there's a way to take advantage of the fact that they use their phone so much.

82
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:18,540
Maybe I'll consider creating more video and less interactive graphics which don't work as well in phones.

83
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:24,890
So planning and creating content for an actual audience becomes a little easier when you have geographic

84
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:27,000
and demographic data in mind.

85
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:31,250
What we get from those two groups of data is a lot of numbers and facts.

86
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:33,560
This is what we call quantitative data.

87
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:37,850
These are all numbers and other measurements that get dynamically collected and displayed in dashboards

88
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:39,740
platforms and other reports.

89
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:40,730
Google Analytics.

90
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,130
You remember that from S.R.O.

91
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:47,870
Remember this point is a main source of quantitative data for many people because while besides being

92
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:51,640
a free tool it collects as much data as possible from web site visitors.

93
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:56,360
Now those numbers and facts are important but they're only half the picture.

94
00:05:56,450 --> 00:06:01,490
They tell us who what where when and how people check out our content or made a purchase.

95
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:03,620
But they don't really tell us why.

96
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:07,400
And that's where we start talking about psychographic data.

97
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:12,710
Now psychographic data the third one that we mentioned beginningless lecture might sound like the name

98
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:17,690
of a German heavy metal band but it refers to the psychology behind our target audience.

99
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:21,860
It tells us why they do things instead of quantitative data.

100
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:25,820
It gives us the qualitative data focusing on three key aspects.

101
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:29,550
Usually it's their interest their activities and their opinions.

102
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:35,210
Let me break those three down real quick because they go a long way towards explaining why psycho graphics

103
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:36,270
are so useful.

104
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:42,090
Interest are the types of things that drive us everyday like our family our job or getting fit.

105
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:47,120
Interests are the things we're always thinking about and they kind of drive a lot like the decisions

106
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:47,880
we make.

107
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:53,120
Activities are more like hobbies or occasional things we do like taking vacations creating craft beers

108
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:59,410
becoming the best call of duty player in your squadron or clan or whatever they call it.

109
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:04,580
We take part in these activities because we enjoy them but they don't necessarily drive our everyday

110
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:05,540
decisions.

111
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:11,270
Now opinions in the case of psychographic refer to the things around us that we have opinions about.

112
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:17,060
These could be certainly things like the government human rights or let's say education but they might

113
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:23,150
also be about more specific issues like what we think about the lack of a headphone jack on our new

114
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:24,220
iPhone 7.

115
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:28,760
Or what kind of chain of coffee we prefer to go to.

116
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:33,950
If we knew this information about our audience the things they were interested in activities they participated

117
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:39,200
in and their opinions about other things we'd have a much better chance at creating content geared for

118
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:43,040
them instead of guessing that our content ideas might be a good fit.

119
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:46,610
We know there is an interest because we have psychographic data.

120
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:49,720
Ok then how do we get this psychographic data.

121
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:53,860
One way to collect it is a survey a bunch of people in your target audience.

122
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:57,920
You give them statements about relevant things and ask them if they agree with them.

123
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:01,900
Kind of like do you agree or disagree with the following statement.

124
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:05,720
Apple products have a better design than any other company.

125
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:06,750
That's an example.

126
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:12,080
You could also ask open ended questions like What's your opinion of Toyota vehicles.

127
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:14,320
And then note what people say about it.

128
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:16,720
Open ended if you're not familiar with the term.

129
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:21,910
It's a question where the answer is not just a yes or no better or worse.

130
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:26,980
It means that they have to respond in somewhat of a paragraph explaining themselves.

131
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:30,620
It's open ended because the person answering can go anywhere they want with it.

132
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:36,590
Now you can actually talk to people in real life or chat with them as well and ask them these questions.

133
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:41,750
You can also collect information through observation by following and basically stalking your users

134
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,420
on your Facebook page.

135
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:48,050
You could look into their lives or at least their social lives on their social network.

136
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,350
You might be able to see things like number one.

137
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,120
What do they say about your product service or company.

138
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:53,850
Do they like it.

139
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:54,850
Do they hate it.

140
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:59,240
Do they cite lots of problems or offer help and solutions other customers.

141
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:03,520
Number two you might find out what kind of content they themselves post.

142
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:10,880
Is it fun that instructional pictures are mostly text or is it only videos that you might find out.

143
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:15,950
What sites or influencers do they frequently reference or share a post from.

144
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:20,270
So really you have three options you can ask questions your customer is sitting out something like a

145
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:25,790
survey or just asking them or you can try talking to your customers either through a live chat option

146
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:32,150
or right after they buy something you email them or you can just observe people look at their Facebook

147
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:38,090
page look at the stats you see on Google Analytics trying to go and see how your customers behave out

148
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:38,830
in the wild.

149
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:43,370
If you can collect psychographic data about your audience who will be much better positioned to create

150
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:46,730
content that's more focused like highlighting features.

151
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:52,160
You know people care about because of their interest or writing about issues you know people have strong

152
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,010
opinions on.

153
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:58,490
But now what do you do if you don't have any customers yet or just say enough data to know anything

154
00:09:58,490 --> 00:09:59,220
for sure.

155
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:05,120
Well if you can't define a current audience you can define the audience you want to have.

156
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:10,410
Think of a competitor or a Web site you want to be like and then research them instead.

157
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:15,140
Or you can even think of a Web site where you think your product or service would be a perfect match

158
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:15,640
on.

159
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:17,430
Maybe they don't compete necessarily.

160
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,690
They could easily see what you're doing showing up on their site.

161
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:25,970
Let's say for example you built an app that combines recipe lists shopping lists and Amazon Prime.

162
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:30,350
Making it crazy easy to pick a recipe click a button and then get all the ingredients you need liver

163
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:31,120
to your house.

164
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:34,680
Maybe this makes sense because hey blister hard and nobody likes to shop.

165
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:38,720
So people who check out recipe Web sites might be interested in an app like this.

166
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:44,090
In this case the audience that visits the recipe Web site let's say serious Edes Dotcom for example

167
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:46,670
could be the exact type of audience that you want.

168
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:52,460
Now if only you could look at serious Edes Dotcom's data and see who these people were.

169
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:57,920
Well put that Web site you can but you have to use a market research website to do it information about

170
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:02,690
every site isn't always publicly available but you can create a free account on a market research site

171
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:07,970
like Quantcast dot com and find data on some of the biggest sites around.

172
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:14,450
Shows a long list of detailed reports on traffic demographics geographic data interest and more on the

173
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:16,070
sites that they can measure.

174
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:21,590
I think a clock cast kind of like Google Analytics for someone else's web site not your website.

175
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:27,230
Serious Edes dot com which you can see here pull it up on the screen just happens to be one of those

176
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:27,890
sites.

177
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:31,250
So what data can you see about serious Edes.

178
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:36,620
Well there are a whole bunch of categories and indexes telling you the specific information about the

179
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:41,470
Web site visitors the site gets mostly U.S. visitors which you can see at the top.

180
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:46,640
Demographics is next and if you click on composition you can see the data for serious each Dotcom's

181
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:47,830
actual visitors.

182
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:51,260
Slightly more female than male mostly in their 20s and 30s.

183
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:56,990
However if you can click on index you can see if the site appeals to certain types of demographics more

184
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,740
than the average web site.

185
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:05,300
In this case serious eeds has a larger concentration of 25 to 34 year olds and college graduates than

186
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:09,600
the average web site and especially users of Asian descent.

187
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:14,260
Whatever reason as you keep scrolling down you'll find other insights that could be helpful.

188
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:17,350
But 70 percent of Web site visits are mobile.

189
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:22,190
So whatever you create better be mobile friendly under shopping interests and packaged goods.

190
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:27,590
You can see a higher index of interest in baby related products so we probably have a group of moms

191
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:33,940
and dads visiting the site and there's interest in other food and recipe related websites like say save

192
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:34,960
your doc.

193
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,350
I hope I said that right.

194
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:40,030
Lucky Peach dot com and Splendid Table dot org.

195
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:45,710
Discovering this we can research a few more Web sites and see the type of content they produce for the

196
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:46,790
same audience.

197
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:50,020
So what do you do with all this market research data.

198
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:55,670
Record the interesting pieces of data like the items we found and make it available to anyone else who

199
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:59,380
helps create your content or even markets and sell your products.

200
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:03,660
This data can help you make decisions about what to create or avoid.

201
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:09,230
However discovering that you have let's say like a lot of Asian readers for example doesn't mean you

202
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:15,170
should only cater to that group specifically what data like this means is that when the opportunity

203
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:20,990
to present content relevant to that user group comes up it makes sense to try it but not necessarily

204
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:26,270
to only do that with so much data is so many different forms the demographics the geographics and the

205
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:27,150
psycho graphics.

206
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:32,070
It would really help to put everything into an easy to use convenient kind of package wouldn't it.

207
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:37,250
Well our next step will be to take this data and turn it into something useful to help us come up with

208
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:40,670
ideas and content what we call a user persona.

209
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:42,870
All right we'll cover that in the next lecture and I'll see if.
