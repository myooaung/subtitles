00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.720
All right, here we are at the end of this 
section about good old press relations.
1

2
00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.190
I want to leave you with some closing thoughts on 
your efforts to get coverage, so here's some tips you
2

3
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:12.480
can write down, memorize, or frame and put on
the wall - if you do that, please send me a photo.
3

4
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.630
First off, get to know the people
you pitch before you pitch them.
4

5
00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:17.010
Data has shown it helps.
5

6
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.730
Something like two thirds of the editors out there 
are more likely to give pitches a look when they
6

7
00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.520
come from people they know or have at least had some
notable interaction with. But engaging with writers
7

8
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.020
and bloggers isn't just a benefit for 
when you want to pitch them.
8

9
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.540
Getting to know them can give you a lot more insight 
about your industry, your competitors, and the concerns
9

10
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:37.590
customers might have.
10

11
00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.190
So think of it as market research 
and press outreach all in one.
11

12
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.290
Now, secondly, get in the habit of being helpful.
12

13
00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.020
* Help me. Help me. Help me help you. *
13

14
00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:50.630
* Help me. Help me. Help me help you. *
14

15
00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:03.600
* Help me help you. * A few of these tactics I discussed 
involve you doing things that don't immediately benefit
15

16
00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.410
you, but instead help others.
16

17
00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:10.350
Doing surveys and polls for reporters, answering 
questions for people on Reddit and Quora, or replying
17

18
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.250
to writers' Twitter chats and posts.
18

19
00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.680
These are all ways of participating in the 
conversations out of those social platforms.
19

20
00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.570
While you might be trying to reach specific writers 
and reporters, remember there are plenty of lurkers
20

21
00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.550
out there in the audience, people who might be 
interested, but less willing to participate. When they see
21

22
00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.400
someone like you chiming in with helpful information,
22

23
00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:35.490
suddenly you've become someone worth following,
engaging with, and asking questions of. You can become
23

24
00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.680
a source or an influencer just by being 
helpful and sharing what you know.
24

25
00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.640
Now, the whole Twitterverse and 
social world is bigger than you.
25

26
00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.970
There's a lot of people out there trying to get something
and you can help in many ways that can eventually
26

27
00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.460
lead to wins for you. When it comes to making contact,
27

28
00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.150
keep everything short and personalized in your pitches.
28

29
00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.570
Reporters have limited time and attention to give you,
because of their busy jobs, and because they're
29

30
00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.910
getting dozens, if not hundreds of pitches just like yours.
30

31
00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:01.740
Be direct, offer value, and treat them like human 
beings, and not just as a way to get free marketing.
31

32
00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.750
Be direct, offer value, and treat them like human 
beings, and not just as a way to get free marketing.
32

33
00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.650
Remember, those ideas about being helpful and getting 
to know them, well, if you're doing these things,
33

34
00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:15.240
it'll make your pitches that much better, because you'll 
know what your reporters like, what they want, and
34

35
00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.530
ways you can help them out.
35

36
00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.990
And lastly, none of this is going to work 100% of the
time. Listen, PR is going to be a numbers game, and
36

37
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.360
you might be in a situation where you just suck at 
writing pitch emails at first, and even at first maybe
37

38
00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.940
you're picking the wrong reporters,
38

39
00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.350
reporters that really aren't very helpful.
39

40
00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.700
PR is really a skill that with experience you will get 
exponentially more effective at. This advice,
40

41
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.810
these tips I've offered, these can 
get you part of the way there.
41

42
00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.630
Now, there's no reason, with what we've covered,
42

43
00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:46.110
you can't get your first one or two articles written 
about you, that is more than enough to get you your
43

44
00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.520
first 500 customers.
44

45
00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.750
However, if you want to increase your odds and make it 
such that you don't have to spend enormous amounts
45

46
00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.660
of time getting these things in the future, well,
46

47
00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:55.270
of time getting these things in the future, well,
47

48
00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.540
you're really going to have to 
practice and build experience.
48

49
00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.800
Now, applying these tips, trying them out, and adapting 
them to your own situation, and then looking for
49

50
00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.610
new opportunities we didn't even discuss here,
50

51
00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.520
well, that's going to be on you. If you can stick 
with it and build on whatever success you get, then
51

52
00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:08.850
yeah, you'll do fine.
52

53
00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.530
Now, you might reach a point where you're spending 
a lot of time and effort on PR efforts or your business
53

54
00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.220
has grown and you need some bigger
guns help you promote things.
54

55
00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:24.360
Now, perhaps, in that situation, you'll need to invest
in a PR agency or a PR freelancer. Now, PR agencies
55

56
00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:29.010
can be great, because they already have a lot of contacts 
you're trying to engage with and get noticed by,
56

57
00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:29.380
can be great, because they already have a lot of contacts 
you're trying to engage with and get noticed by,
57

58
00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.600
so you essentially skip that step of finding the people you care 
about and then getting them to actually recognize your name.
58

59
00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:34.560
so you essentially skip that step of finding the people you care 
about and then getting them to actually recognize your name.
59

60
00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.170
So the question then becomes, why wouldn't 
you go this route from the very beginning?
60

61
00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.820
Well, because PR agencies can be really, really expensive.
61

62
00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.720
Well, because PR agencies can be really, really expensive.
62

63
00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.900
They usually charge you a monthly retainer and they 
devote a certain number of hours to your cause.
63

64
00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.880
And, by the way, working with an agency does not even 
guarantee you coverage, they're trying, just like you
64

65
00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.260
are, to make the right connection.
65

66
00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:57.520
It's just that usually they have more experience and 
they have a lot more warm connections. Oftentimes,
66

67
00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.480
in the very beginning, when you have a lot 
of free time, or at least your time is cheap,
67

68
00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:06.270
sometimes I see people, they'll hire a PR agency, and 
then after the fact, once the PR agency charged them
68

69
00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:11.010
thousands and thousands of dollars for one article, they looked 
at what they did and said, "Wow, I could have done that."
69

70
00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:11.580
thousands and thousands of dollars for one article, they looked 
at what they did and said, "Wow, I could have done that."
70

71
00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:16.500
So when should you consider a PR agency? If your 
business is at a point where it makes sense to get press
71

72
00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:17.850
coverage so it can grow,
72

73
00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.410
well, you might be ready. If you're doing lots of marketing 
and outreach, well, if your product or service
73

74
00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.730
is doing decently well, and if you could easily describe 
it to customers, and they actually get what it
74

75
00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:31.290
is you're trying to do, well, that's a great start. If your 
business is growing in terms of customers, employees,
75

76
00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:35.580
and making money, and you feel like it's the right
time to grow or scale things up even more,
76

77
00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:40.650
well, at that point it might be the time, because PR is 
a really big time suck. Now, certainly, you can make
77

78
00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.380
contact with an agency and get their thoughts,
78

79
00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:47.310
but I might also recommend talking to other people who are 
using agencies to get their read on how helpful they are.
79

80
00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:47.810
but I might also recommend talking to other people who are 
using agencies to get their read on how helpful they are.
80

81
00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:49.050
If you select an agency you want,
81

82
00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:53.250
that's the first thing I usually do is I ask for the 
people they've worked with and to include them
82

83
00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:56.420
as references, then I can talk to those 
people and say, "Hey, was this even worth it
83

84
00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:01.380
from your perspective?" You've got to remember at the end of the 
day these people are also salespeople, so if you say, "Should
84

85
00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.060
I use you?" they're not going to say no.
85

86
00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:07.920
However, if you're just starting out with PR, well, you have 
plenty of time before you get to thinking about an agency.
86

87
00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:08.740
However, if you're just starting out with PR, well, you have 
plenty of time before you get to thinking about an agency.
87

88
00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:10.470
Just keep these tips and ideas in mind,
88

89
00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:14.160
go back to the lectures if you need to, and
remember to be helpful along the way.
89

90
00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:18.210
It's really a great mindset to get into if you're 
hoping people will help you in return.
90

91
00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:19.940
All right, guys, good luck and God speed.
91

92
00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:20.790
See you in the next section.
