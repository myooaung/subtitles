00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.560
Hey guys, welcome back to the course. So, in this lecture,
what we're going to do is we're going to use the strategy that
1

2
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:12.600
we covered in the last lecture, the reaching out to
pain customers, and we're going to talk about how
2

3
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:17.790
exactly you find them. Then, in the next lecture, we'll talk about
how, once you found them, how do you reach out to them.
3

4
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:18.660
exactly you find them. Then, in the next lecture, we'll talk about
how, once you found them, how do you reach out to them.
4

5
00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:22.160
Now, this is our first technique
because it is the laser focused.
5

6
00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:27.490
If someone out there has the problem you are trying to
solve, and your product obviously solves the problem,
6

7
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.090
it's a very good chance they will buy your stuff, and
there's not going to be a whole lot of dependencies
7

8
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.960
involved, they're not going to ask you
how many other people have bought it,
8

9
00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:40.320
they're not going to say, "Well, I haven't
seen a TV commercial for it."
9

10
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.890
If they have that problem, they are
always the most likely to purchase.
10

11
00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:50.230
Now, the first thing we want to do is take that problem
and imagine we are the customer that has it.
11

12
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:57.300
Now, how exactly would that customer
unwittingly verbalize that problem?
12

13
00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:03.900
How exactly would you mention you have this problem?
How would you explain it and what scenarios would
13

14
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:10.320
you bring it up? Try to get in the mind of your overly
complainy older sister and try to channel their
14

15
00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.600
obsessive need to constantly notify everyone of
things that bother them. To help you through it, let's
15

16
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.280
cover a couple examples.
16

17
00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:17.580
All right.
17

18
00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.190
Example number one. Let's
imagine we were making an app,
18

19
00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:29.820
and this app - mobile app - is designed to help people
stop forgetting where they put things, to help people
19

20
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.650
stop losing things, essentially.
20

21
00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.360
Now, you yourself right now try to imagine
you're someone that constantly loses things.
21

22
00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.700
How exactly would you verbalize it?
22

23
00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.770
Now, first of all, we just need to kind of
think it out, right? Now, if I lose things,
23

24
00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.360
well, everybody loses things, what are the most common
things they would lose? Well, the most common things
24

25
00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.600
people lose are probably keys, credit cards, wallets, hair,
25

26
00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:01.800
if you're older. Now, let's just take one of those.
If I lost my keys, I would probably use the phrase "lost
26

27
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:10.440
my keys," would probably say things like "constantly
losing my keys," "can't stop losing my keys,"
27

28
00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:16.890
anything along that vein. I would even probably ask the
question of "anything to help me stop losing my keys?"
28

29
00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:17.340
anything along that vein. I would even probably ask the
question of "anything to help me stop losing my keys?"
29

30
00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.480
"anything to prevent losing my keys?" The key point here,
30

31
00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.860
no pun intended, is that they will say "lose," "losing," "keys."
31

32
00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.640
no pun intended, is that they will say "lose," "losing," "keys."
32

33
00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.050
So those are the phrases we will hook onto.
33

34
00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:34.770
And if you couldn't find someone off that, you'd move
on to the next item or the next type of complaint
34

35
00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.570
that someone would voice.
35

36
00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.780
All right.
36

37
00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:42.480
Now, a second example. Let's say we're making a web application
and it helps people track their social media mentions.
37

38
00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.610
Now, a second example. Let's say we're making a web application
and it helps people track their social media mentions.
38

39
00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:48.600
Now, like on Facebook, when someone mentions something
and they say @your name, or on Twitter where they
39

40
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.240
mention you, or Instagram, they do it as well.
40

41
00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.410
mention you, or Instagram, they do it as well.
41

42
00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.880
Now, if I had that problem, I might think of saying
"can't manage my social media accounts,"
42

43
00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:06.270
"too many followers," "too many mentions," "can't find
list of mentions" + Twitter, + Facebook, something
43

44
00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.750
like that. If you can identify the problem,
44

45
00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:14.130
and we've done that before, and you can identify
generally how someone would articulate it, then basically
45

46
00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:20.160
100% of the time you will find someone who has said
that. Now, the three places you should first start
46

47
00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:26.650
searching you probably know, and I apologize, because
this is a very basic technique. The first one is Twitter.
47

48
00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:27.390
You've heard of that one.
48

49
00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.240
The second one is Reddit.
49

50
00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.630
You might have heard of it. Maybe, maybe not.
50

51
00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.240
And the third one, everyone's heard of this one, Google.
51

52
00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:35.370
The first one we start with
52

53
00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.760
and our go-to, always number one we go to is Twitter.
53

54
00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.300
Now, why exactly do we use Twitter first?
54

55
00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.960
Well, for one, they let all of their
conversations be indexable.
55

56
00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:47.810
That is why I don't say Facebook.
56

57
00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:53.220
You cannot go and search and find a conversation
some private user on Facebook had,
57

58
00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.290
whereas Twitter, it's kind of the point.
58

59
00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.260
It's all about being public and everyone seeing your stuff.
59

60
00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:04.140
Twitter also as a whole has a very large user base,
it's something like 300 million, and it's really just
60

61
00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:10.330
a giant hub of conversations, and more
specifically, a giant hub of complaints.
61

62
00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:15.540
And the first thing you do if you want to search
on Twitter is just go to search.twitter.com, it'll
62

63
00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:21.420
link you to the actual URL that I can never seem
to remember, it's like search-home, and if
63

64
00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:26.250
you can't find that, just Google "Twitter search."
So what it ends up giving you is a big search bar that
64

65
00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.670
basically looks like anything you'd see on Google.
65

66
00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:31.730
Now, we don't need to get fancy with this one, right?
66

67
00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:38.790
We can just search for exactly the types of complaints
we came up with previously, just input those, and
67

68
00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:44.580
then try to weed through the results and try to find people
that are actually specifically talking about your problem.
68

69
00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:45.560
then try to weed through the results and try to find people
that are actually specifically talking about your problem.
69

70
00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.190
It is really that simple,
70

71
00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:53.640
but it's not terribly easy to read through all the
chatter to find ones that are talking about what
71

72
00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:55.070
you are talking about.
72

73
00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:01.690
But do your best, find some people, write them down, mark
them, so you can come back later and reach out to them.
73

74
00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:02.080
But do your best, find some people, write them down, mark
them, so you can come back later and reach out to them.
74

75
00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:08.390
Now, the second place that we are going to comb
through for potential complainers is Reddit.
75

76
00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:09.680
Have you ever heard of Reddit?
76

77
00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:16.720
It's reddit.com, it is basically a forum on
steroids. You know how forums work, right?
77

78
00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:21.710
People post individual topics, then people talk about
it, and there's main topics and specific topics.
78

79
00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:27.120
Well, Reddit is like that. Reddit is divided into
what are called subreddits, and subreddits are
79

80
00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:32.110
basically just like miniature forums within a gigantic forum.
80

81
00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:38.650
Now, most people know Reddit for probably
nefarious reasons or pranks that people play,
81

82
00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:41.600
but it is an enormous forum.
82

83
00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:50.110
It has 231 million users, and they have
something like 8 billion pages.
83

84
00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:53.150
They're one of the biggest pages on the internet.
84

85
00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:58.610
But more importantly, because they're structured
in subreddits and reddits, there are
85

86
00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:04.480
subreddits basically for everything out there: horse
breeding, scuba diving, people who are obsessed with
86

87
00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:08.120
one celebrity, people who have the first name
87

88
00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:15.010
Adam - pretty much anything you can think of, there
is a subreddit directly or indirectly related to it.
88

89
00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:15.380
Adam - pretty much anything you can think of, there
is a subreddit directly or indirectly related to it.
89

90
00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:21.370
We're going to keep coming back to Reddit because it is just
a goldmine of potential customers, so get cozy with this one.
90

91
00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:22.330
We're going to keep coming back to Reddit because it is just
a goldmine of potential customers, so get cozy with this one.
91

92
00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:27.440
Now, how does one exactly search through this
community to find the people that we want?
92

93
00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:28.900
Well, it's a trick question.
93

94
00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:29.530
You don't.
94

95
00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:35.250
You don't actually have to search or navigate
through the community structure of Reddit.
95

96
00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:37.170
All we have to do is search for the complainer.
96

97
00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:42.370
Now, Reddit is like a lot of websites in that they have
a search bar, you can see it when you log in
97

98
00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:47.470
or you just go to the front page, but that
search bar does not work very well at all.
98

99
00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:50.840
Instead, we're going to use a workaround,
because it's 10 times better
99

100
00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:55.340
and a lot faster. Actually, just go to Google. Go to Google,
100

101
00:06:55.390 --> 00:07:00.460
we're going to use a very basic trick to search
Reddit through Google's search engine.
101

102
00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:02.510
So what you do is you just go up to the search box.
102

103
00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:09.320
The first thing you type is site:reddit.com,
no spaces at all in that.
103

104
00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:15.010
What that means is we say "site equals", what we're telling
Google is that we don't want you to search the entire internet.
104

105
00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:15.830
What that means is we say "site equals", what we're telling
Google is that we don't want you to search the entire internet.
105

106
00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:21.510
We only want you to search pages that
come from the domain Reddit.com.
106

107
00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:27.570
And then, after you type site:reddit.com, then
actually put in your normal search criteria.
107

108
00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:30.910
So use your complainy search terms,
108

109
00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:37.600
get creative, and use that operator at the beginning of your
Google search, and most likely you will find some stuff.
109

110
00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:38.440
get creative, and use that operator at the beginning of your
Google search, and most likely you will find some stuff.
110

111
00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:39.530
Write them down.
111

112
00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:40.460
Come back to them later.
112

113
00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:43.070
And then the last one is the most obvious, Google.
113

114
00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:45.400
I mean Google, we're on it already,
114

115
00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:46.930
so it's very convenient.
115

116
00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:50.930
Just take those search criteria and
just do a generic search for it.
116

117
00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:56.980
I mean, it's such the case that we cannot possibly
search all active communities online for people who
117

118
00:07:56.980 --> 00:08:00.730
have our potential problem, but Google can.
118

119
00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:08.560
So try your best to search and pick out some people,
regardless of what site or domain they're on, that
119

120
00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:15.580
you can reach out to. In the next lecture, we'll cover
how exactly you tackle that wide variety of different
120

121
00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:17.650
domains and types of websites.
121

122
00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:18.550
All right, see you in the next lecture.
