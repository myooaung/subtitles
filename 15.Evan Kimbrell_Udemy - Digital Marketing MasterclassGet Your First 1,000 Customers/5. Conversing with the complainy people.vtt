00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.430
Hi guys, welcome back to the course.
So this is the last part of this strategy
1

2
00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.660
number one. Last part, reaching out to them,
2

3
00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.850
how do you do it and how can you be effective while doing it?
3

4
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.080
So how do you do it?
4

5
00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:17.990
Well, it's relatively easy, so let's start with the
first place that we covered, which was Twitter.
5

6
00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.090
The first thing you need to do is create a Twitter account.
6

7
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.890
It's very easy, you hit "Sign up,"
7

8
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.670
you fill out some information,
put a profile photo, yada yada yada,
8

9
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.800
you should be done in 15 seconds.
9

10
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:35.550
Now, I honestly suggest that if you're not doing this
technique, you're not going out and talking to people
10

11
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.910
who specifically have your problem,
11

12
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.930
you still make a Twitter account.
12

13
00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:40.400
Why?
13

14
00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.120
Because in a lot of the techniques in this course we're
going to use Twitter, because it's incredibly useful
14

15
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.980
for growing your business. Even in this section,
15

16
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:54.660
we will cover more broad ways that you can build a
Twitter page and use that to grow your business.
16

17
00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.920
So don't skip over it.
17

18
00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.580
At a minimum, create an account.
18

19
00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:02.940
So we're going to use the Twitter account not for
broad purposes, but for messaging specific people.
19

20
00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.880
Once you have the account, now you're ready to roll.
20

21
00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.820
So go back to the list of people that you
found, and now you have two options.
21

22
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.970
One, you can direct message them
or two, you can tweet at them.
22

23
00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.560
Now, those of you that are out there that
have absolutely no idea what Twitter is,
23

24
00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.230
it's a system where you can create an account and have
people follow you, and then you can send messages
24

25
00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:30.660
that are 180 characters long about whatever you want
to, mention other people, mention articles, share
25

26
00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.410
how you are feeling at the time, and all
the people who are following can see it.
26

27
00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:40.200
So it's a big web of communication,
complaints, and celebrity gossip.
27

28
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.520
Now, the two ways that they allow you to communicate
with each other is by sending direct messages just
28

29
00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.180
like the same way you do it in Facebook, or
even LinkedIn, or any other platform, really,
29

30
00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:56.520
and the other one is tweeting. Tweeting is when you
share those 180 character posts, and then tweeting
30

31
00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:04.260
at someone is when you either tweet to them and
mention them or you reply to their individual tweet.
31

32
00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:09.750
Hopefully, that didn't just boggle your mind, it's really
not that confusing. Now, between the differences
32

33
00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.220
of direct messaging or tweeting at them,
33

34
00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:19.050
if you can direct message them, that is better, and
direct messaging will show up in this one section
34

35
00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.010
right over here when you can do it.
35

36
00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.100
Now, you can only direct message people
if they follow you, that's the catch.
36

37
00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.770
Now, you can only direct message people
if they follow you, that's the catch.
37

38
00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:32.340
So that means that you can only direct message people
that you already have some established contact with.
38

39
00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:33.390
So that means that you can only direct message people
that you already have some established contact with.
39

40
00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.680
Now, if that is an option to you, you already have a Twitter
following and these people just so happen to be following you,
40

41
00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.310
Now, if that is an option to you, you already have a Twitter
following and these people just so happen to be following you,
41

42
00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.850
great. Message them, that's going to get you the best ROI.
42

43
00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:46.230
Now, if you can't direct message them and you still
wanted to pursue this avenue, here's one strategy.
43

44
00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.560
What you can do is go to their page
and just follow them. If you follow them,
44

45
00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.120
they get notified that you followed them,
45

46
00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.750
there's a good chance that they will follow you back,
at which point you can direct message them.
46

47
00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.560
Worst case scenario, they don't follow you back, but
they might go to your page and check out your website,
47

48
00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.590
which is essentially the same thing anyway.
48

49
00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.460
Now, if direct messaging just doesn't work out for you,
49

50
00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.280
the other alternative is tweeting at them.
50

51
00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.470
Now, again, you can tweet at them generically
or specifically respond to their tweet.
51

52
00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:18.510
I suggest you respond to their tweet. And the
way you do this is you find the complaint,
52

53
00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:24.600
the specific thing that you had identified before as
them having the complaint, them self-identifying
53

54
00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:25.950
as having this problem,
54

55
00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:27.750
and you click the Reply button.
55

56
00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.970
Now, craft your own response.
56

57
00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.830
I'll give you some suggestions.
57

58
00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.920
Make sure that you include a mention of them, and
the way you do this in Twitter is you just put @
58

59
00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.520
and then look at their name,
59

60
00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.540
you'll see it up at the top, and say @their name.
60

61
00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:48.540
Now, what that does is it gives them two notifications
as opposed to one. If you just reply to them, they
61

62
00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.330
get a notification that someone replied to them,
62

63
00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.780
but if you did that and mentioned them, they get two,
someone mentioned you and someone replied to you.
63

64
00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.090
Better chance of them seeing it.
64

65
00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.130
Once you do that, it's public.
65

66
00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.730
They can see what you said and other people can
see that you said something to them, so a little bit
66

67
00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.330
of social pressure to at least acknowledge your message.
67

68
00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:14.040
Now, if they don't respond back to you or start a dialogue
and then check out your website, you at least
68

69
00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.450
have an ancillary benefit of the fact that you posted
on their page and other people will see it. If
69

70
00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:22.400
they're reading the person's complaint,
potentially they have the same problem.
70

71
00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.470
Now, if they don't respond, don't
worry about it, follow up later.
71

72
00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:27.350
Send them another one.
72

73
00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:28.080
If that doesn't work, send them another one.
73

74
00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:29.040
If that doesn't work, send them another one.
74

75
00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.280
And at that certain point, just let it go.
75

76
00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.990
I mean, there's an infinite number of people you can
message this way, and guess what, it costs nothing,
76

77
00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.980
just your time.
77

78
00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:44.070
Now, the key here when you write a message for responding
to someone on Twitter is that you need to connect
78

79
00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.490
the specific problem to your specific solution.
79

80
00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.890
Don't just say "Hey, saw you had a problem.
80

81
00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:54.960
Check out our stuff." That is too generic,
too salesy, people are just going to hate that.
81

82
00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:00.450
What you should do is, let's give an example. Let's say
someone was complaining about how a software doesn't
82

83
00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:03.430
let them export into Excel.
83

84
00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:11.220
If your software did, you could respond and say "Hey, our
software exports into Excel and solves some of your other
84

85
00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:12.700
problems, check it out."
85

86
00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.320
That is a correct response.
86

87
00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:16.350
You just helped them.
87

88
00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:21.900
You provided some kind of value, and you showed that
you're not just a robot that's generically scanning
88

89
00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:26.340
their information, you're actually trying
to talk about what they are talking about.
89

90
00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:31.710
Now, let's check out Reddit. Now, similar dynamics apply
here, because when someone posts something, you
90

91
00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:40.170
can either post a reply, or you can direct message them.
Again, I suggest direct messaging, because more
91

92
00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:42.590
often people will respond to that.
92

93
00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:48.690
Typically, if someone posts on a thread in Reddit,
and someone replies to them, they might read the
93

94
00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:53.690
first couple replies, but often it just gets buried,
because a lot of people are posting.
94

95
00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:59.280
They might just not get around to responding, or
they might see your response and it's next to like ten
95

96
00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.610
other people who also responded at the same time.
96

97
00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:06.420
But a direct message in general is going to get a
higher response rate. And similar to Twitter, if you
97

98
00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:10.070
do end up replying to them on a page,
98

99
00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:16.290
less likely to respond, but there is a chance that other
people will read it and those people might potentially
99

100
00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:18.300
have that problem, it gets you more exposure.
100

101
00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:22.360
Now, the key with Reddit honestly is timing.
101

102
00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:27.090
It is kind of the case that people just use it when they're
bored and they kind of flit from page to page to page.
102

103
00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:29.040
It is kind of the case that people just use it when they're
bored and they kind of flit from page to page to page.
103

104
00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:33.930
So if you can respond very quickly, if someone posts
something and you can get a response while they're
104

105
00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:39.960
still on the website, that dramatically increases
the chance of them reading it, responding, starting
105

106
00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:42.410
a dialogue, and potentially getting a customer.
106

107
00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:48.690
Now, my preferred technique for reaching out on
Reddit is to try to sound as non-salesy as possible.
107

108
00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:51.810
I'd like to say something along the
lines of, you know, since it's a complaint,
108

109
00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:53.100
"Hey, that sucks.
109

110
00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:57.100
The way I solved it was [...]" or "You know, I had
that problem as well. That's why I did this."
110

111
00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:58.740
The way I solved it was [...]" or "You know, I had
that problem as well. That's why I did this."
111

112
00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:05.760
Remember, you are a human and they are also a human
being, you are individuals, they do not want to be treated
112

113
00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:08.630
like something to be pitched to.
113

114
00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:15.690
Reddit especially is grouchy and very sensitive to
being marketed towards, so make sure that you read
114

115
00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:20.730
your message, whatever you write, at least twice, and make
sure you are trying to be as conversational as possible.
115

116
00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:22.010
your message, whatever you write, at least twice, and make
sure you are trying to be as conversational as possible.
116

117
00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:25.200
Sound like a human and they
will respond to you like a human.
117

118
00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:30.180
The last little bit of advice I'll give you here is make
sure that when you are responding in a public
118

119
00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:35.580
thread, you know whether or not you're responding
to the individual person and their problem and what
119

120
00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:42.030
they said or the group post as a whole, because there's
generally a theme, and then everyone's responding
120

121
00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:48.030
to it. So you're either responding to a response or the initial
response that everyone is talking in a tangential kind of angle.
121

122
00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:49.250
to it. So you're either responding to a response or the initial
response that everyone is talking in a tangential kind of angle.
122

123
00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:53.470
If you don't pay attention to how you're doing
that, you can come off sounding like an idiot.
123

124
00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:59.400
You can respond to someone's individual complaint,
but their complaint was about the complaint or the
124

125
00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:03.430
topic that everyone is talking about, and
it just sounds like you're out of the loop.
125

126
00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:05.510
It will really hurt you. And the last one, Google.
126

127
00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:06.160
It will really hurt you. And the last one, Google.
127

128
00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:07.430
Well, to be honest with you,
128

129
00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:11.250
this one is just a crapshoot, because
Google can search literally anything,
129

130
00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:13.880
so you're going to find a lot of different stuff.
130

131
00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:18.270
Now, there's a lot of different mediums that you'll
find people complaining, and in general they kind
131

132
00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:19.950
of fall into three different categories.
132

133
00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:24.850
One, they're going to be sites and platforms
that allow direct communication, great. Two,
133

134
00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:28.080
they're going to be sites that allow passive participation,
134

135
00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:35.390
you can post like a comment or reply and hopefully they
read it or someone else passing by sees it, and three,
135

136
00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:36.140
you can post like a comment or reply and hopefully they
read it or someone else passing by sees it, and three,
136

137
00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:41.970
there is no channel for communicating between
users or with the person who originally posted.
137

138
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.300
Now, some places are better than others,
and I try to pick these out of the crowd
138

139
00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:51.570
earlier on. Quora.com is a great one, question and
answer website where people are actually serious, it's
139

140
00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:53.020
not Yahoo Answers.
140

141
00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:58.430
People will post legitimate things on there and you
can post as a reply or reply to other people's reply,
141

142
00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:02.970
you can actually get a very good back and forth
and you can direct message, which is great.
142

143
00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:04.110
Meetup.com, that's another example of one.
143

144
00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:06.080
Meetup.com, that's another example of one.
144

145
00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:09.540
It's passive communication, so you can post on the walls,
145

146
00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:14.400
you can kind of participate in the threads, and you
can send messages to people, but there's a lot of
146

147
00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:18.720
weird rules around it, but you can find
groups that are around your topic,
147

148
00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:22.740
then you can look in the threads and see if people
are complaining about specific things. And then, past
148

149
00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:25.110
that, any niche forum is going to be great.
149

150
00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:29.740
You know, if you are looking for complaints about
something related to video equipment, there are a
150

151
00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:33.090
bajillion forums with thousands of people in them.
151

152
00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:38.190
You've just got to find one of them, sign up, and
then same thing. You know, for all of these,
152

153
00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:42.690
the name of the game is the exact same thing, you're going
to sign up, you're going to find the people, you're either
153

154
00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:45.960
going to try to direct message them
or reply to them publicly,
154

155
00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:49.080
you're going to try to relate your
posts directly to their problem,
155

156
00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:53.540
try to sound as human and not as salesy as possible.
156

157
00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:56.680
Try your best to start a dialogue. If you start a dialogue,
157

158
00:09:56.850 --> 00:10:01.350
you can convince them to buy your stuff, and if they
don't buy your stuff, well, at least you got some feedback.
158

159
00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:07.330
Now, if you've run into a blog, well, post in the comments,
people will see that. If you can't post in the comments,
159

160
00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:12.130
well, try to fish out the email of the person who posted it
or some of the people that have commented, some
160

161
00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:16.510
types of blogs will allow you to find their e-mail
address or to click through to their user account
161

162
00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:21.990
where you can then message them and if you can't do
either one of those, well, continue to the course, because
162

163
00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.240
we will cover ways that you can contact people that
you shouldn't have any way of contacting them.
163

164
00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:29.960
we will cover ways that you can contact people that
you shouldn't have any way of contacting them.
164

165
00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:31.000
It's a bit of a trick.
165

166
00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:32.500
But you'll learn it later.
166

167
00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:34.600
All right, guys, get out there and do this.
167

168
00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:37.780
Questions, concerns about this strategy as a whole,
168

169
00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:40.650
just let me know. If you do this long enough and
169

170
00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:43.810
you persevere, and you don't just give up easily,
170

171
00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:49.030
you will find a customer, and worst case scenario, you
will get some feedback about your idea, which is
171

172
00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:54.880
crucial, because when you move on to the next strategy
or the next strategy, you're more likely to be successful.
172

173
00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:55.720
crucial, because when you move on to the next strategy
or the next strategy, you're more likely to be successful.
173

174
00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:57.000
All right, see you in the next lecture.
