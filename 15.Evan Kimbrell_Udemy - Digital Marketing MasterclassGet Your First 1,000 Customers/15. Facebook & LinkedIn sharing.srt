Hey guys, welcome back to the course.
1

2
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:08,070
So in the last lecture we talked about how you can
thank your parents for covering your college tuition
2

3
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:10,440
by pitching your business to them in an email.
3

4
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:11,700
Really easy thing to do.
4

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:17,040
And if you want to follow the natural arc of development
as an entrepreneur, well, you want to make sure you
5

6
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,300
don't skip that step.
6

7
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:23,760
The more engaged and on the radar your network is,
the more likely you'll be able to use them for support
7

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,700
down the road and to get through the hard times.
8

9
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:32,490
OK, so in that lecture, we talked about sending an email
directly and focusing on making a personal connection
9

10
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:36,240
and being as open and as relevant as you possibly can.
10

11
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:43,080
Now, how would you take advantage of your network if
you wanted to reach out to everyone that is technically
11

12
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:49,160
in your network and not just the ones you can access
via email and that you picked out for your list?
12

13
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:55,130
Well, the easiest way to do that is through the
platforms that we have available for such purpose,
13

14
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:56,670
Facebook and LinkedIn.
14

15
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:02,040
No, we aren't going to devise a plan to snipe direct
messages to all of our friends with targeted coupons,
15

16
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,980
your coupon is worthless
16

17
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:09,300
if I barely know who you are and the last time we
talked was at a party when I thought your name was
17

18
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:14,180
Steve even though it was Greg, and I may
or may not have forgotten to say bye,
18

19
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:18,180
even as you said it across the room. This one is way simpler.
19

20
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:24,000
We're just going to post on these systems and use it as
a one time broadcast channel for letting everyone
20

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,240
know what you're working on.
21

22
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:31,050
Why Facebook and LinkedIn? You might ask. Well,
because these are two of the most prolific networks out
22

23
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:33,500
there that allow you to message everyone at once.
23

24
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:35,100
And people, believe it or not,
24

25
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,960
on both of these networks are actually kind of used to it.
25

26
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:40,710
OK, so your product or service is ready to go.
26

27
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:42,390
Your website is looking slick.
27

28
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:45,730
How would I post about said slick website online?
28

29
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:48,220
Well, okay, let's start with Facebook.
29

30
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:53,400
Now, if I was posting on Facebook about my product,
would I say something like "My product is way better
30

31
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,380
than another product you've never heard of?"
31

32
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:55,650
than another product you've never heard of"?
32

33
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,480
Well, no, you wouldn't.
33

34
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,250
Would you say "I'm homeless. All I need
is $10,000 for a Tesla to sleep in,
34

35
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:02,390
Would you say "I'm homeless. All I need
is $10,000 for a Tesla to sleep in,
35

36
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:07,200
and by purchasing my SAAS software you'll
be getting me one step further to that goal"?
36

37
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,900
No, that's not going to work.
37

38
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:15,350
In fact, Facebook doesn't technically allow you to
promote your business through your personal account,
38

39
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:18,240
but for the most part we can get around that.
39

40
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,530
Now, there are three different
ways you can go about doing this.
40

41
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:27,330
Number one, share a story. The automatic go-to
for this kind of strategy is to tell a story about how
41

42
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:31,400
you started the business and made
the product you're talking about.
42

43
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,330
People are naturally interested in what problems
you had and how you overcame them.
43

44
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:39,330
People really like to celebrate that sort of thing.
44

45
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:45,060
You also have to remember this thing is coming from
an account labeled with your personal name.
45

46
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,090
They expect it to represent you.
46

47
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:50,130
So tell your personal side of the business.
47

48
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:51,890
"This is a problem I had. This is what I did." Sprinkle
in some funny anecdotes, one or two of them,
48

49
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:56,350
"This is a problem I had. This is what I did." Sprinkle
in some funny anecdotes, one or two of them,
49

50
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:57,400
and guess what?
50

51
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:59,330
"Finally it's here, oh my god,
so proud. Here's a trackable link."
51

52
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,540
"Finally it's here, oh my god,
so proud. Here's a trackable link."
52

53
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:06,720
The second way of doing this correctly is to share a moment.
What is some anecdote or thing that's happened
53

54
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,860
with your business you would normally tell your friends about?
An observation about a customer, a bad advertisement for
54

55
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:13,500
with your business you would normally tell your friends about?
An observation about a customer, a bad advertisement for
55

56
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:19,440
a competitor you saw, your first employee dressed
up hilariously for Halloween. Whatever it is,
56

57
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,580
these are just excuses to post and bring
your business to everyone's awareness.
57

58
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:30,600
Now, the third strategy I suggest using is to just be
completely open and ask for feedback instead. Say,
58

59
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,190
"Hey, I worked hard on this. This is what I believe in.
Anyone got feedback that might help me?"
59

60
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:33,390
"Hey, I worked hard on this. This is what I believe in.
Anyone got feedback that might help me?"
60

61
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:35,920
"Hey, I worked hard on this. This is what I believe in.
Anyone got feedback that might help me?"
61

62
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:40,890
We learned last lecture that opening yourself up like
this is endearing and people will naturally want
62

63
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:44,850
to help, if that's the case, and
naturally, they might share it, and
63

64
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,070
naturally, they might buy it themselves.
64

65
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,860
So that's really how that works.
65

66
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:53,640
Tell your story, share a moment you've had along
the way, or just ask the community for feedback.
66

67
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,040
Small question. Do you add a photo?
67

68
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,010
It's really up to you.
68

69
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:01,380
I personally wouldn't, because you
want it to be as personal as possible.
69

70
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:06,490
You don't want production value or the
perception of production value on this.
70

71
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:12,590
Make sure to post your posting with a view setting to
Everyone so that literally everyone can see it and it's
71

72
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:17,520
not just limited to your close friends or one of those
weird settings that Facebook has. Now, the same
72

73
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,850
rules really apply for LinkedIn,
73

74
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:22,800
but there's just a couple of variations
and a couple of differences.
74

75
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,810
LinkedIn is obviously more business oriented, so you're going
to lean away from telling your personal story just a little bit.
75

76
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:29,420
LinkedIn is obviously more business oriented, so you're going
to lean away from telling your personal story just a little bit.
76

77
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:35,640
You'll want to tell the same stories and moments, but focus
it more on other people's problems that you're solving.
77

78
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,350
You'll want to tell the same stories and moments, but focus
it more on other people's problems that you're solving.
78

79
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:41,850
They are, after all, businesses browsing their feeds,
and they're always on the prowl for things that scratch
79

80
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:48,660
their own businessy itch. A 1,000 word post about how
you fell in love with Mr. Splashy Pants and wanted
80

81
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:51,920
to make an oil capturing net doesn't exactly
work very well on LinkedIn. On LinkedIn,
81

82
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:53,610
to make an oil capturing net doesn't exactly
work very well on LinkedIn. On LinkedIn,
82

83
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:59,070
you're going to post this as an announcement, and
here you can actually be more salesy if you want to.
83

84
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:03,110
You can offer a 25% discount code at the very end of it.
84

85
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:05,610
Now, is it a good idea to do that?
85

86
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,380
I would say it's a toss-up.
86

87
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:13,250
Personally, I would offer a call to action, but make
the posts personal and less sales oriented.
87

88
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:14,480
So really try this one out.
88

89
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,250
It shouldn't take longer than 15 minutes.
89

90
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:21,020
Worst case scenario, your friends tell you what a
great job you're doing and you'll get that warm and
90

91
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:25,880
fuzzy feeling that's similar to indigestion that might
just give you the strength to make it one more day.
91

92
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,370
fuzzy feeling that's similar to indigestion that might
just give you the strength to make it one more day.
92

93
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,830
All right, guys, I will see you in the next lecture.
