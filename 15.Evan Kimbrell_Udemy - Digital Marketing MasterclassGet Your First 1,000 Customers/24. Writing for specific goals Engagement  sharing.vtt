00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:02.210
Hey guys welcome back to the course.

2
00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.770
Here we go again talking about creating content for whoever is it.

3
00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:12.700
Well one of those reasons or an idea for is to get people to join in and participate in some way.

4
00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:14.580
That's what we call engagement.

5
00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:21.870
And it can take the form of many different things likes comments replies shares what our engagement

6
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:26.650
is meaningful because it's that next level beyond just reading or watching something.

7
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.490
It's how people show their support or voice their opinion on what you've created.

8
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.730
And this is where engagement is important for you.

9
00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.060
Your business and your product that feedback can demonstrate popularity to others.

10
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.540
It can also help create buzz and with more people reacting to your content.

11
00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.790
More people actually end up seeing your content which is basically free marketing.

12
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.060
So that's how we increase exposure and take your content marketing from something that only gets you

13
00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:55.380
10 customers to something that could easily get you 500 if done correctly.

14
00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.530
The other point is that much of this can be done for free.

15
00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:59.800
Yes for free.

16
00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.170
It costs nothing for you to post content on social media platforms or blogs.

17
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.480
The tricky thing is getting people to react to it and people react to your content with a like or with

18
00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:10.140
an up.

19
00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.810
They're basically giving it value getting comments shows that people are paying attention and want more

20
00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.180
information on the topic.

21
00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.320
So the more reactions your content gets the more likely it will be read by others.

22
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.200
Why.

23
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.660
Because post with 100 Likes For example are going to see more legitimate than a post with zero likes

24
00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.920
this kind of social proof can go a long way towards influencing others to check it out.

25
00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.570
And you know who agrees with this.

26
00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.000
Google agrees with this.

27
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.750
The more engagement you get the better your value.

28
00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:41.120
Yes it's true.

29
00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.070
Google is crazy.

30
00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.980
Google on the other search engines all just came as no other search engines want to deliver results

31
00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.140
with a more human like perspective to them.

32
00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.700
So showing links to content that have a lot of engagement and comments and shares makes more sense.

33
00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.850
So better engagement helps your content again get found more easily.

34
00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.410
So how can you accomplish these engagement goals through your content.

35
00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.760
Well here are four strategies that will get you started.

36
00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.560
One way to get lots of engagement is to offer free stuff.

37
00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.220
I'm talking about free stuff in addition to the free information or content you're already posting.

38
00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.640
It could be a download or a giveaway contest of some kind something with clear value.

39
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.600
If you're a design agency or a consultant you probably have enough experience to create a short ebook

40
00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.160
or an online guide about best practices for the types of clients you've worked with.

41
00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.170
Making that information available for free shows offer your expertise and it's the type of resource

42
00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.710
that often gets shared.

43
00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.250
Want to see some examples.

44
00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:44.040
OK well go to Twitter and search for free design guide or great design guide and you'll see what types

45
00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.580
of guides.

46
00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:45.640
People are sharing.

47
00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.030
If you have another idea for a free download.

48
00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.680
Checking out Twitter is one way to see if other people are doing the same thing and maybe give you ideas

49
00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.690
on how to do it a little bit better now.

50
00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:00.960
The way a giveaway works is your or the site owner and you offer some of your unlimited money to your

51
00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:01.460
readers.

52
00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.900
I'm actually kidding but keep in mind here you have to give something away repeatedly over the long

53
00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.920
term if you're actually giving away real items that can actually get pretty expensive.

54
00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.710
But guess what.

55
00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:20.580
If you have say like a sace to an online subscription tool that's subscription and therefore costs you

56
00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.750
nothing to add more users.

57
00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:28.040
Well then you can give away free months of your plan because it's basically free money for you.

58
00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:32.600
Now you don't have to say at the top of every single post for free.

59
00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.800
I saw one blog actually do it quite well at the very end of their post.

60
00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:41.250
They said something like two best comments get this prize.

61
00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.300
Now the comments you can believe were pretty great.

62
00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:49.860
They were long they were well-thought out and they have lots of sub threads and replies going on.

63
00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:54.330
Another way to get engagement especially comments is to simply ask a question at the end of whatever

64
00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:55.310
you're posting.

65
00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:00.230
Read a post where you present two sides of a debate or two ways to accomplish the same thing.

66
00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:04.560
Uber versus lift which is cheaper and which corrodes the soul faster.

67
00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.670
Versus Squarespace which is better for building web sites.

68
00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:13.020
Take aside and give your take on why one is better than the other.

69
00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:14.220
Write up your findings.

70
00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.360
Make a recommendation and then invite people to give their opinion.

71
00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:23.420
Now you don't necessarily have to write the entire post or on the idea of getting a response.

72
00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:29.430
You can literally just post a rhetorical question at the end of the post like what do you think or would

73
00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.950
you do the same thing the person in my story did.

74
00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:35.540
Or do you know anyone who fits this description him.

75
00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:36.810
It doesn't matter.

76
00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:41.430
Just think it through a little bit trying to think of this as just a one way street where you solicit

77
00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.690
comments and they help you spread your posts.

78
00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:48.260
If people comment you could actually get a lot of interesting and useful information from them.

79
00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:53.700
You can incorporate that back into the post to make it better or use some of the reactions or ideas

80
00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:55.140
to plan your next post.

81
00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:58.530
Now this brings me to an important side note about engagement.

82
00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:03.950
The comments you get from are a great way to better understand who is following who they might support

83
00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:09.430
certain things you say disagree with others or have new ideas of their own that they want to share.

84
00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:11.780
But each comment helps you understand what they want.

85
00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:16.720
A little more helping you create new posts in the future that should be more effective.

86
00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:21.920
OK the next strategy to get more engagement is to give it a great title.

87
00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:26.700
In fact if you don't have a good title people might not even read your post.

88
00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:32.630
Content can be found on social media feeds and search results and your decision to click the link usually

89
00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:36.350
comes down to whether the title looks interesting or not.

90
00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:39.090
So here are some tips for creating a great title.

91
00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:44.050
Number one generally speaking try to keep it between 8 and 12 words long.

92
00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:50.240
I don't know why but data has shown that titles that are in that range get the most shares part of the

93
00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:55.330
reason is that the title actually will completely show up on your mobile device screens.

94
00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:58.300
A lot of people write these really long titles don't realize why no one is clicking on it.

95
00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.670
Well because on your phone you can't read the whole thing.

96
00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:06.140
Tip number two is ask a question in the title appeal to certain needs by calling them out you do something

97
00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:09.730
like new to iOS 10 free apps to get you started.

98
00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:15.860
Just don't make the whole title your question because then the reader has less of an idea of what they'll

99
00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:17.360
get when they read it.

100
00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:20.520
To always be clear with your title what your content is about.

101
00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:24.110
You can try putting a question at the beginning or the end of it doesn't really matter.

102
00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:26.630
Tip number three is dial up the drama.

103
00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:32.350
Rewording your titles with bigger more dramatic or unusual adjectives can get more attention.

104
00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:37.610
By all means keep the title accurate but inject some personality into it.

105
00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:42.220
For example maybe you've got a post called 13 startup success stories.

106
00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:45.800
Well that's pretty dull and almost fell asleep reading it off.

107
00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.790
Why are those stories so meaningful to you.

108
00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:53.150
What can the reader learn from them remix that title up a bit.

109
00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:53.910
Try.

110
00:06:53.990 --> 00:07:01.100
Start of success 13 inspiring companies with lessons you can use or I don't know about how 13 startups

111
00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:06.730
achieve success and you can too whatever it's more dramatic trying to think of something good.

112
00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:09.260
Well here's a fun tool you can try.

113
00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:15.030
It's called the link pait title generator and yes I know it's a little bit weird.

114
00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:18.410
Now there are a few of these online but just check it out.

115
00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:23.120
So let's say you have some type of like let's say you're a food delivery app you've made and you want

116
00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:28.580
ideas for posts you can write type in food delivery into this link bait generator and hit the button

117
00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:32.390
then and bam you've got dozens of ideas for titles.

118
00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:34.130
Now are some of them crazy.

119
00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:35.540
Yeah absolutely.

120
00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:37.420
Are they a bit formulaic.

121
00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:38.910
Yeah absolutely.

122
00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:39.520
Well.

123
00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:43.340
But the idea here is to just give you ideas they'll create better titles.

124
00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:50.060
You don't need to be as slimy or B.T. as these but it does give you an idea of just other ways of angling

125
00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:54.150
it or are different words that are more unusual that you can use.

126
00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:57.120
Just don't use it to create misleading titles.

127
00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:59.340
Be interesting don't be vague.

128
00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:04.970
Now here is our fourth strategy for getting engagement and your post linked to or mentioned people in

129
00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:05.600
your post.

130
00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:10.970
People love to be mentioned or recognized in other people's content so you can bet they'll share your

131
00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:14.600
content especially if they are referenced in a positive way.

132
00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:19.810
Now that we have covered a bunch of ways to get engagement I want to focus specifically on sharing.

133
00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:23.670
Now sharing is a form of engagement but it's different from liking or commenting.

134
00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:24.610
Here's why.

135
00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:30.200
Research tells us that there's actually very little correlation between what we share and what we read.

136
00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:32.560
I know a lot that actually sink in with you.

137
00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:37.790
Well so why is it that sharing is still important then if two people sharing and ever reading it well

138
00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:41.050
because it helps expand your reach and to drive more traffic to your site.

139
00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:45.650
You want more people see your content because a larger audience should help you sell more things get

140
00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:48.100
more clients or whatever you're trying to do.

141
00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:53.670
So even if they don't read it people sharing your stuff leads to actual people reading it.

142
00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:57.080
So it helps to ask though why do people share things.

143
00:08:57.170 --> 00:09:03.080
Well we might be dipping a bit into pop psychology here but there are some reasonable assumptions that

144
00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:03.780
you can make.

145
00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:09.710
Now here are five common reasons that are worth Alli's chewing on about why people share things.

146
00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:13.430
Number one people share content to help out the person who made it.

147
00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:15.400
Your followers may want to support you.

148
00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:18.740
So yes you can ask people you know to share the stuff you create.

149
00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:20.060
It's a great way to start.

150
00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:24.770
Number two people also share stuff because they know someone will appreciate it.

151
00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:28.910
They might be connected to a marketer who would appreciate a post about a new CEO tool they might know

152
00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:33.920
a family with kids who have autism that would definitely want to know about a new scholarship for kids

153
00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:35.070
with special needs.

154
00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:39.590
In a sense your followers want to be helpful to someone else so they share the content.

155
00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:41.370
The third reason worth chewing on is.

156
00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:45.330
People also share stuff to confirm an opinion they have.

157
00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:50.750
If someone believes in a cause or has taken a side on an issue sharing content about it reinforces that

158
00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:54.740
stance and it kind of establishes their public identity.

159
00:09:54.740 --> 00:10:01.250
It could be a political post about a law being passed or a bad review of a they already think will suck.

160
00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:05.650
The content confirms what they believe so they want others to know about it.

161
00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:08.840
People love sharing their opinions for better for worse.

162
00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:14.920
The fourth reason people share is that people also share content as a reflection of who they are or

163
00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:16.300
who they want to be.

164
00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:17.790
It's aspirational.

165
00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:19.060
All of us have probably seen it.

166
00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:23.680
Friends suddenly share a post about weight loss or a healthy recipe or a workout.

167
00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:27.160
Sometimes it's to show off those post-workout abs.

168
00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:28.330
Yeah that's great.

169
00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:28.890
Good for you.

170
00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:30.960
But other times it's a make a statement.

171
00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:35.860
I want to lose weight or I want to eat healthier or I want to be healthier.

172
00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:39.100
Now you might see people sharing posts that are inspirational or emotional.

173
00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:42.900
It's a way to motivate oneself and perhaps share an experience with others.

174
00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:47.980
Now the fifth and last reason why people share that we're going to cover is that they found whatever

175
00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:54.430
they're sharing to be entertaining or funny it could be a funny Bad Lip Reading video or it can be a

176
00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:57.250
great interview with a reverent artist.

177
00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:04.390
The post makes people laugh cheer get nostalgic or stir some type of emotion that's generally something

178
00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:06.130
that people want to share with others.

179
00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:08.940
So there are a lot of reasons why people share content.

180
00:11:08.950 --> 00:11:14.230
The question is can you create pieces that speak to those five reasons.

181
00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:17.360
Consider the reactions you want to get from each piece you create.

182
00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:21.550
And if you write them with those results in mind you should have a better chance at reaching those goals.

183
00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:23.560
All right guys that is enough about engagement.

184
00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:24.970
I'll see you in the next lecture.
