00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.820
When you're looking in the mirror late at night, saying
to yourself "I need customers," what do you do?
1

2
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:06.600
When you're looking in the mirror late at night, saying
to yourself "I need customers," what do you do?
2

3
00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:10.860
First of all, are you sure you don't mean
love when you say customers?
3

4
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.920
And second of all, I feel you. For a lot of first time
business owners, this can be a little overwhelming.
4

5
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.500
You don't know what your options are,
5

6
00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.970
you don't know what other people do, and you don't
know what the hell a content marketing strategy is.
6

7
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:24.570
you don't know what other people do, and you don't
know what the hell a content marketing strategy is.
7

8
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.390
This befuddlement - real word - is one of the biggest
reason businesses and new products flop, and the owner
8

9
00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.460
just doesn't know what to do and ends up dabbling
in several things while being effective at none of them.
9

10
00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:36.470
just doesn't know what to do and ends up dabbling
in several things while being effective at none of them.
10

11
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.700
It's kind of like your dad trying
to help you with all of your homework.
11

12
00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:46.770
Well, let me unburden you somewhat, because, believe
it or not, all businesses on this green - soon to be
12

13
00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.520
brown - planet acquire their customers
through one of 19 different ways.
13

14
00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:52.320
Yes.
14

15
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.500
I'm not joking.
15

16
00:00:53.520 --> 00:01:01.200
You can actually reduce every single marketing strategy
out there to 19 categories. Each magical category
16

17
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.540
designed to make you grow like a Shrinky Dink
17

18
00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.760
is called a traction channel.
18

19
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.790
Now, why do we use the word "traction"?
19

20
00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.620
Well, you can guess what the number one thing that's
going to determine whether you sink or swim is. It's
20

21
00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:18.290
not how many VC pitches you give,
or what your diversity profile looks like.
21

22
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.860
Sadly, most tech companies would disagree
with the former and agree with the latter.
22

23
00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:29.820
It is whether or not you get traction - traction just meaning
you receive positive outcomes based on your effort.
23

24
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:30.320
It is whether or not you get traction - traction just meaning
you receive positive outcomes based on your effort.
24

25
00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.590
What you're doing is resonating with your customers,
and your business is progressing as a result.
25

26
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.900
Those that don't have any traction
with marketing just lose money,
26

27
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.840
they never make sales and they never grow their business.
27

28
00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.630
The second part of the phrase, "channel," is just marketing
lingo for a general area that you can promote
28

29
00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:49.650
your business through.
29

30
00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.860
It's also sometimes referred to as a
distribution channel or marketing channel,
30

31
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.380
but we say traction channel just simply because
it's more accurately what we care about.
31

32
00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.900
Also, we in the marketing community are heavily
invested in using as many buzzwords as we can,
32

33
00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:10.140
if you haven't noticed. Traction is a synergistic value
add for disrupting vertical platforms that will
33

34
00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.410
make you an autonomous thought leader.
34

35
00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.010
Big Data, inflection point, ship it, get out the door.
35

36
00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.120
Now, we don't want to master distribution.
36

37
00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.340
That doesn't mean people will buy your stuff, and
we don't just want to try marketing. At the end of the
37

38
00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.980
day, what we want is traction, a set of practices and
activities that consistently bring in customers or leads.
38

39
00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.910
day, what we want is traction, a set of practices and
activities that consistently bring in customers or leads.
39

40
00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.730
Are you still with me?
40

41
00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:37.050
Hopefully you did not get lost in that sea of lingo.
Traction channels are just the buckets or categories
41

42
00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.970
of promotional techniques you can use.
42

43
00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.650
That is it.
43

44
00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.930
OK.
44

45
00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.470
Like I said before, there are 19 of them.
45

46
00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.950
Can you guess one? Just ask, how do
these companies get customers
46

47
00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.580
and what's an example that comes to mind?
47

48
00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.310
It's probably one of the 19.
48

49
00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.760
So to spare your ears from hearing me talk too much,
49

50
00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:59.190
I'm just going to list off the 19 channels, and then
in the next lecture I'm going to go over briefly
50

51
00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:04.260
the 10 that we cover in this course, and then we'll link
you to where you can learn about the other weirder
51

52
00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.390
ones. And to make this entertaining,
52

53
00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:12.170
I'm going to list them off from memory, and if I get them
wrong, I'm going to shock myself with this Shocky Pen.
53

54
00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.670
I'm going to list them off from memory, and if I get them
wrong, I'm going to shock myself with this Shocky Pen.
54

55
00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.550
All right, here it goes.
55

56
00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:23.040
SEO, SEM, content marketing, viral marketing, social
media advertising, display advertising, speaking
56

57
00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:30.120
engagements, targeting blogs, PR, video marketing.
57

58
00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:39.600
Oh there's some other ones and... And now that my hand
is no longer numb, it's SEO, SEM, content marketing,
58

59
00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:46.750
PR, viral marketing, unconventional PR,
speaking engagements, offline advertisement,
59

60
00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:47.680
that's what it was,
60

61
00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:54.900
social & display advertising, email marketing, trade shows,
existing platforms, affiliate programs, sales business
61

62
00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.110
development, engineering as marketing, and targeting blogs.
62

63
00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.400
Oh also and community building.
63

64
00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.060
I was not even close.
64

65
00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:03.420
All right.
65

66
00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:04.630
Ready to recap.
66

67
00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:09.010
When you want to grow your business,
you have 19 options to do just that.
67

68
00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.860
You are now liberated from the world of unlimited possibilities.
68

69
00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:13.920
You are welcome.
69

70
00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.550
Also, I just listed off the 19 ways,
and whoever made this pen belongs in jail.
