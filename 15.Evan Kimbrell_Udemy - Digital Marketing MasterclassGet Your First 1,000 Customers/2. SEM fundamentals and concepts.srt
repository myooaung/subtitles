1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,100
All right guys welcome back to the course.

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:07,320
We're just starting our SC watchers here and before we dive into the next steps you take to start creating

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:08,750
and paying for ads online.

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,550
Let's use this lecture to cover some of the groundwork and the basics that you should know about SVM

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:18,180
topics things like how PPC words work.

6
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:22,040
And yes we don't know what PPC is and we're going explain that.

7
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:26,910
Now first off you might hear people refer to search engine marketing or SVM as paid search and it's

8
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:30,240
just a way to help distinguish it from organic search results.

9
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:35,820
Now remember that organic search results are the main part of those as the rpms or search engine result

10
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:36,540
pages.

11
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:42,780
But at the top and the sides of those SERPs you see ads and those are where Paid Search Ads will show

12
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:48,060
up now on google those ads come from Google Adwords system being in Yahoo.

13
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:51,060
Also have their own advertising system they're almost identical.

14
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:56,700
So if you want to be seen on their search engine pages then really you just take the exact same thing

15
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,980
you did for Google Adwords and then you go do it for bing.

16
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:01,830
It's just just SEAGE search being advertising.

17
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:07,920
One thing you might notice though on Google when you search and you see organic results and that ads

18
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:09,650
ads are very clearly marked.

19
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:11,060
They're in a different color.

20
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:16,320
They have different background color or sometimes even just say add right above them whereas with Yahoo

21
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,600
and Bing these the same marketing platform.

22
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,710
Now sometimes you can't tell which ones and at.

23
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,200
And Yahoo.

24
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:28,210
I'm not sure 100 percent they still have this but for the longest time they had paid placement.

25
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:34,260
So you could do is pay and have your thing show up as organic and it would even look like an ad but

26
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:35,910
then every time someone clicked it they would get paid.

27
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:39,690
It was like like a shadow and you can understand why Yahoo.

28
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:45,750
Probably not so popular if you're constantly feeding in search results that are just paying you the

29
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:46,320
most money.

30
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,610
People don't want to use a search engine that's going to give them the highest bidder.

31
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:51,440
They want the most accurate search results.

32
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:56,850
So you know one of the big types of paid search advertising out there is known as pay per click or PPC

33
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:57,540
for short.

34
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:00,350
Now the name of this ad type really is accurate.

35
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:06,840
By the way you pay when the user clicks and the amount you pay is based on a bidding system so you never

36
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,840
pay more than what you want to.

37
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:09,750
It's a little tricky.

38
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,780
So let me describe how it works in a little more detail.

39
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,160
So first you decide what you want to advertise.

40
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:18,970
What is it you're trying to sell or get people to check out on your Web site.

41
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,870
Are you driving them to a landing page.

42
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,240
OK.

43
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:29,010
A landing page you guys for God is just a one web page web site that is very focused on one singular

44
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:29,470
thing.

45
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:34,020
The most commonly used with ads so when you click there and you go to a page that's focused it's not

46
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:38,280
distracting it doesn't just throw you on a home page and then you know you have to figure out where

47
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,080
you're trying to find the product is being advertised.

48
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,990
Delaney page might ask for them to buy something.

49
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:44,730
It could ask them to sign up for something.

50
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:48,840
You could ask them to download an app download an ebook whatever.

51
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,840
So if you're trying to do that well then you have to take that in consideration with your advertising

52
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,450
efforts.

53
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,270
Or let's say are you trying to raise awareness of a new product that you're launching.

54
00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:00,280
Well with an ad you generally don't just lead people to your home page.

55
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:02,650
Right you're going to have to bring them to a landing page.

56
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:07,920
So next you should decide which keywords to advertise for to reach your audience for your ad to work

57
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,600
which se R.P. would make sense for your ad to appear on.

58
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:16,580
When people Google phrases or terms or questions you want your ad to show up for the right one so there's

59
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:18,360
an obvious connect with their needs.

60
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:24,090
For example if you're trying to advertise your web hosting services it makes sense to advertise for

61
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:26,440
someone looking for web hosting solutions.

62
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:33,450
So you'd select keywords related to web hosting though you and a thousand other companies will be competing

63
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:34,470
for that same audience.

64
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:39,720
Competitive keywords are the ones that people bid the most for since the biggest audience is seeing

65
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:45,150
ads on those the R.P. pages being able to select specific keyword phrases with high relevance for your

66
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:45,660
audience.

67
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:50,610
But less competition will give you a chance to actually win bids for ad placement and hopefully not

68
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:52,590
pay an exorbitant amount of money for them.

69
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:58,410
Now as far as search ad placement goes you've probably seen ads on these as the RPF before like let's

70
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:00,850
say on this page for Wordpress hosting.

71
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:04,440
Now the best placement is at the top where a few links might appear.

72
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:09,570
And then at the bottom of the page below the first group of organic search results.

73
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:16,050
Now by the way Google stop placing search ads on the side of the page for most SEPs saving space for

74
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:17,520
related information and links.

75
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:20,100
Now as you're watching this now it could actually change.

76
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,200
Google seems to reorganize this quite a bit.

77
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:26,660
So how do you figure out what you want to advertise and which keywords you want to advertise for.

78
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:30,660
You need to set a budget and start bidding on your keywords through outwards.

79
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:34,360
Google gives you different options on how to control your advertising.

80
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:39,450
You can tell them how much you want to spend each time someone clicks your ad how much you want to spend

81
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:40,170
and total.

82
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:45,480
And when you want to start and stop advertising none the question becomes how can you get that sweet

83
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:48,560
top paid position so that your ad appears first.

84
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:52,170
Well Google ranks paid ads based on how much you bid.

85
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,140
But also here's the kicker.

86
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,230
The quality of the ad and the format of your ad especially the relevancy to the keyword.

87
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:02,880
Yes you heard write it's not completely about how much you pay.

88
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:04,330
That's what Yahoo and being do.

89
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:08,890
Google on the other hand wants to match your users with ads that actually appeal to them and help them

90
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:09,820
with their search.

91
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:16,960
Now that ad placement or what it's called is ad rank with capital are like capital a capital R is determined

92
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,040
by something that we call a quality score.

93
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:21,280
That's a very important concept.

94
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:27,130
Now the quality scores a number of Google assigns to each and based on how much you bid and the quality

95
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:32,920
of the ad now the quality is based on a bunch of factors which go beyond your ad it can be affected

96
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,840
by the quality of your landing page.

97
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:40,090
It could be your current click through rate even your past ad words campaigns now click through rate

98
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:46,390
or CD-R is the rate at which people click on your ad when they see it the better and more relevant it

99
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:49,320
looks to them Well probably the higher your rate should be.

100
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:54,570
So if you show your ad to a hundred people and five people click it you're click through rate is 5 percent.

101
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:58,470
So keep in mind that the average C-T are just generally OK.

102
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,990
This is just a big blank.

103
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:00,690
It's not going to.

104
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:06,340
It's not specific to any industry but generally the big blank it would say that 2 percent is the average

105
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:11,920
click rate for a search engine and that means on average 50 people will see the ad before one person

106
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,550
clicks on it.

107
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:16,140
And I mentioned something about the format of the ad to deny.

108
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:22,090
Well as don't just come as text although on those SEPs they are only text.

109
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:27,280
But as you're planning your and think about your audience and figure out how to get the people to click

110
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,720
How do you specifically entice that audience to be interested in what you're talking about.

111
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:36,220
You should be aware of other ad formats as well that you might want to use depending on what you're

112
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:36,820
selling.

113
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:39,670
It could be the case that Texas doesn't work very well for you.

114
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:42,270
So it might be the case you try it on that other stuff.

115
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,760
Here's some examples of the other things you can use through onwards.

116
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:50,050
We have display ads which are basically just banner ads that have been around for forever.

117
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:55,270
Basically they can be images or rich media that includes some animations or interactive features of

118
00:06:55,270 --> 00:07:00,760
some kind of Google even created a gallery of rich media ads you can browse to see how they would appear

119
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,350
on certain pages and platforms.

120
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:05,850
People do some really cool and crazy stuff with display ads now.

121
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:13,630
So keep in mind there's decently high bar but you know it's just a it's just like a blue box that you

122
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:16,620
have to design so it's not too expensive or too time consuming.

123
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:20,250
Mobile Ads are ads that get displayed only on mobile devices.

124
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:25,390
Now these ads need to be formatted for a smaller screen but they can be really useful if you want to

125
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:27,430
reach customers when they're out shopping.

126
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:34,570
Say keeping in mind mobile ads get higher click through rates but their error rate is incredibly high

127
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:39,460
because it's a tiny screen and people have fat phones so a lot of times they accidentally click what

128
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:40,430
you're trying to advertise.

129
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:47,340
So yeah also people who are on mobile are just less likely to buy something on their phone.

130
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:49,340
So you have to kind of keep that in mind as well.

131
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:55,420
And the last thing our app ads which are ads you create specifically to promote ads on mobile devices.

132
00:07:55,450 --> 00:08:00,190
Now instead of driving people to a landing page you can push them right to the download page and your

133
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:03,130
iOS or Google Play store instead.

134
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:05,290
So not a web page.

135
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:10,120
It's basically the same thing as a mobile ad but you just send them right to the iOS or Google Play

136
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:10,510
store.

137
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:14,020
Now makes a lot of sense if people are searching on their phone obviously they want to go look at a

138
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:18,030
page then reconvince to download it then click through and then find it and download.

139
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:24,160
Once you do get your ad placed on the search engine result pages SEPs not only will you begin to see

140
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:30,920
your click through rate but you'll get a cost per click again which is where you will from now on we'll

141
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,980
refer to a CPC member.

142
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:38,410
CBC is how much you end up paying every time someone clicks your ad that cost is going to be determined

143
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:42,080
by how competitive the search term is how much you bid.

144
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:47,410
And then also your quality score in general if Google says you've a really high quality score they really

145
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:51,220
like your ad they think it's super relevant it's not spamming they like your landing page.

146
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:53,080
You'll actually pay significantly less.

147
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,330
You can also evaluate your app based on how many conversions you get.

148
00:08:56,350 --> 00:09:00,670
Now you're probably familiar with conversions at this point in the course but just to be clear every

149
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:05,860
time someone completes a specific task you've outlined for yourself as a goal like making a sale or

150
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,980
getting a registration through a landing page.

151
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:11,690
Well that's called a conversion and it's something you can track in the Edwards system.

152
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:12,600
Pretty straightforward.

153
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:17,560
So the process we discussed here planning your ads picking your keywords and audience and then budgeting

154
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:18,540
and bidding.

155
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:24,340
Those are the steps you'd follow for pay per click advertising and our lectures to come we'll talk about

156
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:28,720
how to place bids in the ADD words system and how to make your ads the best they can.

157
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,970
But I was wondering what about like CPM or CPA.

158
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:35,630
You forgot to CPM cost per.

159
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:42,940
And that's the French word for a thousand like me I can't pronounce it but it means for every thousand

160
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:48,670
people do you pay a certain amount so every thousand people who just see it has nothing to do with clicking

161
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:50,170
on it you pay a certain amount.

162
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:57,730
Google still offers this and you can do it but it's just really inefficient and it's not really something

163
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:59,680
you want to do especially at the beginning.

164
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:03,690
It's very very rare cases where doing CPM is make more sense.

165
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,410
CPA means cost per action.

166
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:07,870
That basically means you pay once someone converts.

167
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:09,160
Google doesn't play that game.

168
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:14,710
Buger only going to CPA is if you have some direct affiliate relationship with someone selling a product

169
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:19,030
or some really nice exclusive advertising platform.

170
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:20,770
All right guys I'll see you in the next lecture.
