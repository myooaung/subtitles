00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.140
Hey guys welcome back to the chorus.

2
00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.480
So we just want other tips for making your written content more SEO friendly in this lecture and I want

3
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:12.360
to demonstrate some of those ideas of how to incorporate keywords into titles Hetter tags structure

4
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.530
content and more.

5
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.850
Let's say you've created an app for your parents to create mini networks with other parents so they

6
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.260
can arrange babysitting on an organized playdates and coordinate other events like parties and day trips.

7
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:24.690
Let's call it parent bot.

8
00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.140
Well parent bot has already rolled out their product.

9
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.510
They've got a bunch of moms and dads using it and they've started looking to expand their customer base

10
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.580
even more so by making their articles and blog posts a sea of friendly new content should give them

11
00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:39.150
a boost.

12
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.700
So a couple of key words parent bought has decided to focus on our let's say parents schedule and mommy

13
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:45.610
app on them now.

14
00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:51.000
So if we're to write a post for the parent bot blog it would help to write something let's say topical.

15
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.820
Let's assume the summer is coming up so kids will be out of school.

16
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.990
One blog post could be the challenges with let's say scheduling events over the summer.

17
00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.180
Lots of people are busy people go on vacation.

18
00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.260
Schedule gets messed up.

19
00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:01.920
Whatever.

20
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.960
Well let's outline this piece and see if we can make it more friendly.

21
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.220
So first we introduce the issue scheduling for your kids can be a real challenge once they're done with

22
00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.660
school and the summer hits.

23
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.610
So this can be a purse where we let's say share 10 tips on how to deal with it.

24
00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:22.110
So this would be my listicle and maybe our title would be 10 ways parents can deal with the challenges

25
00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.330
of a summer schedule.

26
00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.850
Okay that's about 64 characters which is pretty good.

27
00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:33.150
Remember we want to be under 65 because that means mobile screens can actually see it and in general

28
00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.740
even for search titles it has to be within a certain range.

29
00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.370
This should fit on most se RPE pages and social media feeds.

30
00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:45.040
Now if you wanted to shorten it even more you might go ahead with something like this instead.

31
00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.120
Ten ways parents can simplify their summer schedule.

32
00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.930
That's 50 characters and pretty much the hits the same point in less time.

33
00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.750
Which when you choose past that point would be a stylistic difference.

34
00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.190
Now did we manage to use one of our keywords.

35
00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:03.200
Well the words parent and schedule are in there so if people search for parent's schedule and Google

36
00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.190
Well this post should get a boost for including both words.

37
00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.650
Now listicle post is nice because it pretty much provides the structure you'll use.

38
00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:13.500
Start with a short intro to set up what the real list is about.

39
00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.220
Didn't list the 10 items and wrap it up quickly.

40
00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.320
In fact let's start with that intro now.

41
00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.250
Now the Post should start off something I don't know what I like this 10 ways parents can simplify their

42
00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.320
summer schedules summer is here and that's the time when everyone's schedule changes.

43
00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.730
So how can moms and dads plan camps play dates and day trips while keeping their own schedule intact.

44
00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.620
Here are 10 tips to help parents schedule events and fun activities for your kids.

45
00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.280
So first up you should notice that we're not focusing on our app but instead providing some help to

46
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.740
our customers with the same kind of purpose in mind simplifying and improving schedules for parents.

47
00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.960
Now eventually we'll probably plug our output.

48
00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:54.000
For now we're keeping it more general So parents who haven't heard a parent bought would be interested

49
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.140
in the post as well.

50
00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.870
These are some of the core tenants that we covered in content marketing.

51
00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.190
The intro sets the scene.

52
00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.480
Summer is here and then hits on the issue quickly everyone's schedule changes.

53
00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.580
How could moms and dads plan all of this stuff now the text I don't just say how can parents make better

54
00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:09.240
schedules.

55
00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:15.550
I include a bunch of examples of the types of things they'd schedule Kamps playdates day trips whatever.

56
00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:21.900
It helps readers understand that the application of these tips can be used for a broad range of things

57
00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.020
and not just one specific thing.

58
00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.250
Then we move onto our list of 10 items.

59
00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.250
Now we can do some more SCEA work and use Hetter tags.

60
00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.890
Now our header tags will be pretty easy to figure out.

61
00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:37.470
The tag would be the title of our post at the top of the page and then each item in our list could be

62
00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.860
put inside the tags so it might look something like this.

63
00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.540
Here are 10 tips to help parents schedule events and fun activities for your kids.

64
00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:47.650
Number one figure out how many weekends you've got and then you can use.

65
00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.720
I don't know two to three sentences or four to five sentences depending on the style you're going for.

66
00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.870
Describe this point number two search Google for kids summer schedule and the name of your town.

67
00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:57.510
Number three.

68
00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:02.670
Review the summer schedules at local movie theaters parks and museums that are for a created daily routine

69
00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.100
or an morning fun and daily chores.

70
00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:09.540
Now you can always tell I don't have kids and I'm exactly thought about this a lot so my content is

71
00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:10.440
not going to be as good.

72
00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.310
That's not exactly the point we're going for right now.

73
00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:17.850
Now each of those numbered points will have a tag on it and highlighting the text and terms within them

74
00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.210
for Google so knows these are the important points within the page.

75
00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:23.450
Now if you reference things you've written about before.

76
00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:26.220
Make sure you add a link to that article or a post.

77
00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.990
Maybe you wrote a post about how you can use parent bot to create morning schedules and let's say Item

78
00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.910
4 on your list.

79
00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:36.690
The one about daily routines will be a good spot to cross link to your original post.

80
00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:39.350
Remember cross-link to your other pages.

81
00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:41.760
That's a very good thing and Google likes that a lot.

82
00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:46.560
Cross-looking also works well from a traffic standpoint because it creates more ways for people to land

83
00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.630
on other posts and stay on your Web site longer.

84
00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:53.840
Another tactic to improve your SEO value here is to link to tools that you might reference.

85
00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:59.070
Looks like this is a good opportunity to demonstrate with examples so perhaps you link to a source or

86
00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:04.730
another site shows what you mean if possible if you post this article you could reach out to that Web

87
00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:07.100
site and tell them you linked to them.

88
00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:08.900
Now that can lead to more shares and traffic.

89
00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:13.130
So back to our list maybe in the tenth item on the list you could decide to promote your app.

90
00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:17.510
Number 10 use parent bot to connect with other moms and dads in your neighborhood.

91
00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:22.870
So where are you mentioned Paran bot or if you mentioned downloading the app or where ever you put a

92
00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:25.720
link to your app download page.

93
00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:28.990
So the main point of the post was to share advice for your audience.

94
00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:33.430
You can still take the opportunity to promote one of your primary goals for your site which is more

95
00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.840
likely to get downloads and registered users for the app.

96
00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:41.980
By the time you're done writing this list maybe some are in the range of 600 to 800 words long for an

97
00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:42.880
article like this.

98
00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:44.120
Well that's completely fine.

99
00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:50.610
Your audience busy parents don't need a 2000 plus word post of all the ins and outs of scheduling.

100
00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:53.470
They get it what they need are easy tips to follow.

101
00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:57.700
Knowing your audience and creating something appropriate for them again is a key to getting your stuff

102
00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:00.340
shared more often and ranking higher.

103
00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:05.020
From the CEO perspective this post is long enough for Google to know what the page is about and includes

104
00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:09.590
those extra touches like the header tags the leadings and the use of your important keywords.

105
00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:12.060
So this is one example of how to write an essay a friendly post.

106
00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:14.920
There are plenty of other ways to write a post but whatever your topic.

107
00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:17.710
Plan out your structure and information each time.

108
00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:19.900
Have a clear idea of what your posts will cover.

109
00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:24.400
Step by step as that can help you plan your sections using Henares and some patterns.

110
00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:28.870
Keep at least one or two key words in mind as you write and look for ways to reference other content

111
00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:30.820
you've created so you can link to it.

112
00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:36.550
But in the end make sure your title promises something your audience wants and that your finished post

113
00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:38.070
delivers on that specifically.

114
00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:39.210
OK guys well there you go.

115
00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:40.180
That's it for now.

116
00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:41.380
I'll see you in the next lecture.
