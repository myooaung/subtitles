00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.360
Hey guys welcome back to the chorus.

2
00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:07.800
We're the last couple lectures we've been focused on ways to improve the CEO of a page as you know value

3
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:13.810
gets affected by what we write and how well we write it along with the code we use like title tags and

4
00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:15.060
our use of keywords.

5
00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:20.190
Well I want to take a step back in this lecture and discuss how all of your pages and your website as

6
00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:24.930
a whole can be affected by the general design and technical aspects of your site.

7
00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.430
We'll discuss a few of these things that affect SDL and what you can do to improve them.

8
00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:35.280
First off you want to make sure every important page on your site is mobile friendly now mobile friendly

9
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.860
means that your site works on a phone or some other handheld mobile device and that people can easily

10
00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.040
use the features and read the content without any problems.

11
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.020
Now in other words viewing a page on a phone shouldn't cause any disadvantage or inconvenience to the

12
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.560
user.

13
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.650
Now all of you might wonder what exactly that means.

14
00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.250
Does that mean all the pages have to be built like a rectangle.

15
00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.280
No it means that you have to have some responsive design features in it.

16
00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:06.480
Response of design means that your abs they basically have code in it that says how to display given

17
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:13.500
certain resolutions of a phone sees it takes up a different set of instructions versus if a laptop or

18
00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.620
a like Big Mac looks at it because they're using the content management systems like Wordpress for instance.

19
00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.310
They actually have a lot of this stuff built in and if they don't use the plugins that do it now Google

20
00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.000
will analyze each page to see if it's mobile friendly and it counts towards its Estival value.

21
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.000
Programmers can create a mobile friendly Web site by coding in a way to anticipate multiple screens

22
00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.540
laptops phones tablets whatever and take advantage of whatever screen size you are viewing at end.

23
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:39.870
So that could mean a couple of things.

24
00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:45.120
When you visit your site one you might see an alternate version of the page a mobile only version which

25
00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:50.250
has been designed specifically with mobile devices in mind or two you might see the same page as you

26
00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.280
want on a laptop but it gets automatically reformatted to fit the screen.

27
00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.000
This is what I was referring to for when I said responsive.

28
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.040
Basically the code will tell it to change its shape depending on the size of the screen that wants to

29
00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.530
view it.

30
00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.830
Now either technique building a mobile only web site or coding Responsive Web site is an acceptable

31
00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.080
way to create a mobile friendly site.

32
00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:13.440
You guys go to heaven Braille dot com and you're on your phone.

33
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.140
It actually is a risk bots version.

34
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.630
So what ends up happening is you'll notice that like the navigation bar because that's something you

35
00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.020
have to click and it's really horizontal you can't display on a phone.

36
00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.930
So what ends up happening.

37
00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.840
Well you have a separate button that only shows up with the phone you click that then it shows you the

38
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.860
navigation buttons so there's little changes like that you'll notice.

39
00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.400
Now a mobile only site.

40
00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.610
Well try going to YouTube on your phone in the browser and you'll go to him Dot YouTube dot com.

41
00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.800
That's basically an entirely different site.

42
00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:50.490
Try to go to YouTube dot com on your computer and you'll see the really goofy looking phone version.

43
00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:54.240
Now if you don't have a mobile friendly site all your pages might look like this.

44
00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.700
The Texan links look really small on a phone screen.

45
00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:02.130
Links are hard to tap and forms could be really hard to complete lack of mobile friendliness will definitely

46
00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.420
count against the SEO value of your page.

47
00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.970
So use one of the techniques I mentioned to improve your value and make it easier for your site visitors

48
00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.080
to get what they need.

49
00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.650
This is something that Google really started to ramp up on about a year or two years ago.

50
00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.260
So they're getting to the point where they really heavily penalize people now for not having mobile

51
00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.130
friendly sites.

52
00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:25.140
Google said hey I think it's been long enough that people have been using smartphones.

53
00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.420
People need to get figured out and get onboard.

54
00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.830
Now the best way to evaluate this is to just get on a phone and look up your site.

55
00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.980
But if let's say your phone is out of battery or I don't know just being lazy you could also try what's

56
00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.990
called a mobile emulator like this one.

57
00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:42.090
Now this is a fair approximation and might be helpful if you're testing a design but really just use

58
00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.570
a phone.

59
00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.850
Honestly it's the best way to know for sure how your site looks if people are really into the stuff

60
00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.000
will use an emulator because it can show them multiple types of phones.

61
00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:56.400
A lot of the phones they might not own for you you just need to check that your phone has some kind

62
00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.310
of different layout or different Web site.

63
00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:59.460
When you try to go to it.

64
00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.270
Now speaking of testing and design and other aspect of a page that can affect its s.c value is its usability.

65
00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:07.450
Now usability is not a score or something you'll see on a dashboard.

66
00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.120
It's more of a rough measurement of how well-designed a page is to ensure its users can actually do

67
00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.180
everything on the page.

68
00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:19.110
You expect them to usability refers to things you could evaluate on your own pages like clear purpose

69
00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:24.090
when you visit a page is it obvious where you are who this is what the site is for.

70
00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:25.210
Things like that.

71
00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.310
Does it have good design.

72
00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:31.770
Does the page look pleasing to the eye and has everything readable especially on a mobile phone.

73
00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.630
Does it have clear navigation and links.

74
00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.040
Can you find the menus.

75
00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.390
Do you know where the links go.

76
00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:38.970
Is everything easy to click content availability.

77
00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:41.590
Can you find everything you expect and need to find.

78
00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.320
And then does it have functional forms.

79
00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.260
Can you sign up or make a purchase easily using the forms on your site.

80
00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:49.170
Again especially on mobile.

81
00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:53.330
One of the last things to look for a list is kind of minor is what you consider clean code.

82
00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.240
So do all the links work do all the images show up.

83
00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:02.570
Is anything obviously broken is the page written in a way has lots of work arounds and chunks of the

84
00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:08.930
page that don't actually display things or is it crisp clean and every part of the code does something.

85
00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.370
Now if you took this list of items and went through each page by yourself you get a fair idea of the

86
00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:14.860
usability of each page.

87
00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:19.880
But keep in mind that usability testing works best when you ask other people as well.

88
00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:25.370
People who trying to do usual things on your Web site like a web site user do to gauge the design and

89
00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:26.870
usefulness of a Web site for you.

90
00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:31.490
Now if you just get a friend or volunteer to help you test your site just for I don't know five minutes

91
00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:35.420
that can actually give you another perspective that you might not have access to.

92
00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:40.250
Now if you're really serious about this there's also a lot of other tools and legal rolling to the resources.

93
00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:44.090
There's ones where you can pay people and it's like 40 bucks and you get five people to look at your

94
00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:49.470
Web site go through it and then record it as they use it and talk through using it.

95
00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:56.180
There's also easy ones like usability hub dot com the you can do things like five second tests and usability

96
00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:02.690
tests and they do it cheaper but it's like $2 or something per person really down to break the bank

97
00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:06.590
just spend like 20 bucks and you have a decent information and see if some people understand what's

98
00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:07.640
going on on the page.

99
00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:12.220
Now one of the things you might know in usability testing there's also some evaluators out there to

100
00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:17.660
sign up type in the url and it tells you about your usability but usability is kind of subjective.

101
00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:23.120
And so these generators reserve to cover them just because they're not 100 percent accurate I think

102
00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:27.710
they're helpful for pointing you in the right direction but you don't put too much faith in them.

103
00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:32.060
Now one of the things you might notice in usability testing or just by viewing it yourself is the speed

104
00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:32.870
of your website.

105
00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:39.140
Now Web sites be another SEO factor because the slower a page is the less useful it is to the user.

106
00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:41.330
The more often visitors are going to abandon it.

107
00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:45.950
Now part of Google's analysis of a page is called rendering which means Google downloads a copy of your

108
00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:48.860
page and tries to render or download it on its own.

109
00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:53.900
The page is difficult or slow to render for whatever reason Google may decide the page should be avoided

110
00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:55.650
or penalized in some way.

111
00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:59.560
Now if you're curious about the speed of your web site you can use a free testing tool like this one

112
00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:01.210
that pinged them.

113
00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:06.950
It'll give you a decent report on how well the site's doing from different angles including how much

114
00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:10.620
of your site content is made up of images and other file types.

115
00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:13.760
In fact images are one of the biggest sites load problems out there.

116
00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:18.950
So if you and other users upload a lot of pictures to your site and you're experiencing some speed issues

117
00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:24.440
Well that's a pretty serious area to look into your image file sizes might be larger than normal because

118
00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:29.210
they're coming straight from a phone without optimizing it for the web using special code you can require

119
00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:34.340
that images get optimized down to a reasonable size during upload for instance that use to be the case

120
00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:38.660
of what a lot of people would do is when you go to a Web site on your phone it would have code that

121
00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:41.680
basically would resize a big image.

122
00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:46.280
So it ends up happening is to download the big web version of the image and then resize it down to what

123
00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:47.710
should fit on your phone.

124
00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:53.990
Now the better way of doing that is actually to have the server have two images on it have it be essentially

125
00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:56.210
responsive and recognize hey it's on a phone.

126
00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:59.080
Let's download this small version of the image.

127
00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:00.720
Small things like that can early on.

128
00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:03.510
So if you see any bad spots do what you can to improve them.

129
00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:07.220
But if you're not very technical of your site has hundreds of thousands of pages.

130
00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:12.050
Well you might actually think about working with someone hiring a freelancer to help do these things

131
00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:12.590
for you.

132
00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:16.520
There is an entire cottage industry of people who work on SU optimization.

133
00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:17.710
They're not hard to find.

134
00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:22.750
So mobile friendliness usability and Web site speed are all aspects that can impact the experience of

135
00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:29.150
users have and the value of all those pages improving these should have a positive impact on the entire

136
00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:29.540
site.

137
00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:31.150
So they are worth your attention.

138
00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:31.880
Sounds good.

139
00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:32.270
OK.

140
00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:32.860
Moving on.

141
00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:33.680
See you in the next lecture.
