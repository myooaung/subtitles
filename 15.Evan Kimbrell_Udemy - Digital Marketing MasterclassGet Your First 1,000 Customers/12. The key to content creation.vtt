00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.120
Hey guys welcome back to the course.

2
00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.930
OK so we have a pretty good understanding of what the most common types of content are out there.

3
00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:13.020
And we have a rough idea of how big the playground is we have to play it with regards to how Lucy goosey

4
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:19.320
we can get with our topic matter great so we know what we can write about and how what form it should

5
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.270
probably be in.

6
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.980
But you know past that point.

7
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.530
What is it that makes content marketing work and what is it that makes it not work.

8
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.790
After all we all probably know some 22 year old backpacker who's traveled to 12 countries and now wants

9
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.680
to backpack for a living and isn't yet making it.

10
00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.440
Well number one maybe you should title your blog something other than girl traveler and number two.

11
00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.070
Perhaps you should start borrowing other people's Instagram photos of their beach feet because yours

12
00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:48.350
look kind of weird.

13
00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.050
There were three.

14
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.900
Well do the individual pieces of content on your site add any value.

15
00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:55.380
Like at all.

16
00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:56.510
Are they unique.

17
00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.870
Do people read them and go.

18
00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.190
I'm glad I read that.

19
00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.840
Now I want you to really stop and be critical right now not critical like your mom when you moved back

20
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.680
after college but critical isn't really trying to think objectively about you.

21
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.130
I've read online.

22
00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.150
They are the last thing you read online and think about how you found it.

23
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.600
Maybe you searched for a guide on how to install any apps emulator on your iPhone or maybe your friend

24
00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:24.150
to post about famine in Africa after you read it did it actually stick with you.

25
00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:30.150
Do you actually remember what it said and did the information of substantial impact on your day your

26
00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:30.680
week.

27
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.790
Or you just read Eat Pray Love.

28
00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:33.890
Did it change your life.

29
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.400
I'm sure you can remember a time you read something online and thought it was awesome.

30
00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:42.390
Bookmarked to share it with your friends and maybe you still reference it today and I'm sure you can

31
00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:48.560
also think of something you read and almost immediately wonder to yourself why did I just read that.

32
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.330
Well like we said before it all comes down to the guiding light the north star so to speak of content

33
00:01:54.330 --> 00:02:00.000
marketing which is value if whatever you're reading or whatever you're writing provides value to the

34
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.110
reader it will stick and it will be a traffic generating asset.

35
00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.850
Now that's all nice and whatnot.

36
00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.620
Eat your vegetables and you'll become healthy.

37
00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.220
Wash your hands and you won't contract cholera.

38
00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:12.860
Make your content valuable and people will flock to it.

39
00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.740
But what does value at the end of the day actually mean.

40
00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.460
Because it's another one of those buzzwords.

41
00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:24.810
I'm so sorry to constantly say at the end of the day value with respects to online content comes down

42
00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.330
to really three things.

43
00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.080
What does it entertain you to.

44
00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.590
Does it educate you.

45
00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.650
Or three does it compel you to do something it doesn't have to do.

46
00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.700
All three of course to be valuable but it does need do at least one of those.

47
00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.520
It's really those three things.

48
00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.360
Does it entertain you educate and or compel you to do something.

49
00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.320
OK so that goes for really all content out there.

50
00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:55.140
If it has value that it's got one or more of those three elements for your purposes you'll most likely

51
00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.100
want to focus on delivering value that educates and or compels people.

52
00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.990
I'm not saying forget about entertaining people with your content but what I am saying is if you're

53
00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:10.710
a business you probably don't want to focus on it exclusively unless you know of course if your business

54
00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:17.670
is entertaining people like with stories doing a series of funny videos or something you know even generated

55
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.980
towards lifestyle content.

56
00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.600
If that's the case and that's what you're doing then yes of course you do want to entertain them.

57
00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:28.260
But for the vast majority of people no I think this is something at the very beginning at least you

58
00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.940
should avoid most of you watching us though are trying to get customers to buy a product download an

59
00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.860
app or connect with you for professional services of some kind.

60
00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:42.590
Your best bets for value are going to come from content that educates and compels people to do something.

61
00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:42.840
All right.

62
00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.330
So let's concentrate on those two aspects just here for a little bit.

63
00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:52.260
When people look for content that educates them in the end they'll ask themselves something did I learn

64
00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:53.410
something from it.

65
00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.140
Do I now understand the topic better.

66
00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:03.240
And did I learn something that I can apply immediately or did it really do nothing for me there's nothing

67
00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.430
I can do now that I couldn't do before this.

68
00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.220
Sometimes it's easy to come up with ideas on what to teach people but sometimes it's really not.

69
00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.080
OK so let's look at this from a different one.

70
00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:17.050
When do people usually want to be educated by content online.

71
00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.870
It's when they need to learn something or understand it better so they can apply this knowledge towards

72
00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:27.300
something something like a job or a project they're working on research they're doing in support of

73
00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.200
something bigger or like creating a plan or making a purchase.

74
00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.580
Let me give you an example.

75
00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:38.310
With all this talk of conta you might hear a lot about the importance of having say like an e-mail newsletter

76
00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:38.940
on your site.

77
00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:44.190
So at some point you might finally cave in and say OK let's start an e-mail newsletter.

78
00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:45.310
How do I do that.

79
00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:51.030
Well like everything else you probably would google some form of the question how do I set up an email

80
00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:51.810
newsletter.

81
00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:57.960
And when you do that search you'll find things like the beginner's guide to setting stuff up how to

82
00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:03.400
guides for steps to do this the four steps to do that guides there are usually a lot of choices when

83
00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.870
you search for educational content and if you wrote one of those pieces yourself and people click through

84
00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:08.330
to it.

85
00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:09.580
Yay for you.

86
00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:10.580
Your stuff got found.

87
00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:13.840
But that doesn't necessarily equal Valley at least not yet.

88
00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:18.030
All it means is that your title seems promising enough for people to give it a shot.

89
00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:23.250
That moment people start gazing upon your page the words and the graphics and the screenshots and the

90
00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.300
Hopefully videos and everything else you created.

91
00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:30.270
You'd better bring them something that will appease them at this moment.

92
00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:34.390
So if you are searching for a guide for setting up an email newsletter How would you measure the value

93
00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:36.830
of one of those content pieces that you landed on.

94
00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.340
Well first off.

95
00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:43.930
Number one does the content on the page match the title you clicked on from the search results.

96
00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:47.260
In advertising we call this convergence.

97
00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:53.110
It's the connection between what you're projecting you're going to sell me and then when I actually

98
00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:55.420
get to your page what are you actually selling me.

99
00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:59.200
It's very similar with content marketing it's the differences between the title because usually people

100
00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:03.460
see the title and click on the title and then they go to the actual page with every title you create.

101
00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:06.360
You also create an expectation or a promise.

102
00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:11.500
So your blog post or video or whatever it needs needs to deliver on that promise.

103
00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:14.260
You need to confirm that value does exist.

104
00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:19.750
Number two is your content laid out or designed in a way that makes it easy to read and understand part

105
00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:23.870
of the value of your content is its convenience and its usability.

106
00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:28.780
If people have to work too hard to figure something out or if there's any confusion or doubt they'll

107
00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:29.810
go somewhere else.

108
00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:33.460
It's like putting together a Lego set without the directions.

109
00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:38.920
Theoretically it is possible but I wouldn't suggest doing it nor would I find it enjoyable.

110
00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:41.740
So with your content make it easy to consume.

111
00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:46.460
Break up large pieces of text into smaller paragraphs turn lists into bullets.

112
00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:49.380
Turn your written directions into numbered steps.

113
00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:51.820
Use pictures to provide detail and context.

114
00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:53.890
Make it easy to consume.

115
00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:56.620
Number three is the information or solution provided.

116
00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:01.630
Complete doesn't give you all the steps you need for setting this email thing up.

117
00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:03.590
Are you getting the whole picture here.

118
00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:06.420
If you say there are four steps setting up an email newsletter.

119
00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:13.410
Other really four steps and are four steps enough and if you promised an ultimate guide in your title.

120
00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:16.230
Did you deliver an actual ultimate guide.

121
00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:20.680
You'd be amazed how many ultimate guides out there are only like two pages long.

122
00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:24.020
Come on have you really provided a resource that's actually ultimate.

123
00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:28.510
If anything is missing the reader's going to feel short changed on the value that you promised with

124
00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:30.550
the headline and number four.

125
00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:34.940
In the end does the content leave you with a clear idea of what to do first.

126
00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:38.110
Like where do you go or what action to take.

127
00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:43.210
This is a part of the value that is badly missing from a lot of quote unquote educational content out

128
00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:43.720
there.

129
00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:48.490
Articles and videos might bury you in details and knowledge but if you don't know where to start or

130
00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:52.550
how to apply all of it that means they didn't really do their job.

131
00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:59.060
So deliver the content promised in your title design and lay it out well make sure it's complete and

132
00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:05.190
matches what you promised and then let people know what they need to do first after reading it.

133
00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:10.330
I always said that valuable content should be educational and or compel people to do something while

134
00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:12.690
by communicating a clear first step.

135
00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:16.230
Compelling people with the direction that actually makes sense.

136
00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:19.460
People like linear processes.

137
00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:24.470
They don't want some abstract article that they're more confused at the end of than when they start

138
00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:24.790
it.

139
00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:28.040
You'll understand this better if you actually look at an example.

140
00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:31.440
OK so let's say we Googled how to set up an email newsletter.

141
00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:37.000
Now two of the results I see her are four steps to start your email newsletter the right way.

142
00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:42.640
This is the wrong way from the flip a blog and a beginner's guide to starting an email newsletter and

143
00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:44.860
building a mailing list from Venture Harbor.

144
00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:49.750
Both the titles seem legit enough and I totally understand why people would check out the four steps.

145
00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:53.970
First of all because 4 doesn't really sound like that many steps at all.

146
00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:57.620
When you actually read it you realize that it's pretty weak.

147
00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:59.340
That's spending too much time here.

148
00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:01.420
Some of my thoughts from reading this.

149
00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:03.990
You guys can read if you want to put in the resources.

150
00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:05.480
It's pretty sloppily written.

151
00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:10.510
Each one of the four steps is pretty weak and sometimes it really just goes off track which is hard

152
00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:16.180
to do in a post that's as short as this is the author mentions data at some point in the article to

153
00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:21.780
support a choice of an email service that tell you the actual data to back up their point.

154
00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:23.510
Kind of makes you think there may be an affiliate.

155
00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:24.870
There are no pictures here.

156
00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:26.080
Nothing for me to look at.

157
00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:26.370
Which.

158
00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:30.660
Hey you know it's important sometimes the breakup all this tax done absolutely necessary.

159
00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:35.620
But it's nice and generally put in the extra effort and at the end the question the author asked is

160
00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:39.940
do you have an email list or tips for choosing a email service.

161
00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:46.430
If I had an e-mail newsletter already why would I be reading an article about setting up a newsletter.

162
00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:50.550
I'm left with a shaky recommendation for a service so I don't feel confident.

163
00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:52.490
The value here is low.

164
00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:58.670
There's a lot of mismatch in expectation and what I actually get so I generally am going to keep looking.

165
00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:03.160
Now on the flip side it let's look at that venture herber blog post and I love the way it starts with

166
00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:06.280
the first section titled Why would you want to run a newsletter.

167
00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:07.370
That's a great question.

168
00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:12.100
If I'm here reading this post it means I've wondered about that myself and it might not necessarily

169
00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:16.780
be 100 percent convinced the other hits you with the right amount of stats to prove his point and he

170
00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:20.960
gives you some good reasons why it makes sense for a business to have an email newsletter.

171
00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:21.410
Great.

172
00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:23.120
OK tell me some more.

173
00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:28.270
It's got three sections of detailed information at Scott how to start a newsletter how to get email

174
00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:33.430
addresses and how to send your first newsletter complete with screenshots and a pretty logical flow

175
00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:36.550
to it all the other posts offered mostly advice.

176
00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:40.210
This is the set of detailed instructions with advice sprinkled through out.

177
00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:44.620
It tells you what to do and why not just why I ought to do it.

178
00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:49.360
There's much more here I can apply immediately and I have confidence because each step is explained

179
00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:52.290
to me through out in other words this poses a lot of value.

180
00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:58.660
I've been educated and I'm now compelled to take the next step so we can evaluate content here.

181
00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:02.510
But yes I know it's a different world when you're actually trying to create it yourself.

182
00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:03.600
So let's recap.

183
00:11:03.610 --> 00:11:07.300
When you start on the path you have to evaluate the piece before you post it.

184
00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:09.390
Have you delivered on the promise your title makes.

185
00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:10.590
If not hey.

186
00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:14.110
A title can be changed or you can just rewrite what you wrote.

187
00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:14.650
Number two.

188
00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:16.600
Have you made it easy to read and consume.

189
00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:18.980
If not please just keep editing it.

190
00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:20.520
Put some Polish into it.

191
00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:21.400
Or three.

192
00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:25.420
Have you delivered everything you need to and have you given people a logical first step.

193
00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:27.940
They can take after reading it if you don't.

194
00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:32.740
All of those things and you should feel pretty comfortable enough to post what you've got your feedback

195
00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:33.490
and engagement.

196
00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:36.570
Like chairs and comments will tell you whether or not it worked.

197
00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:38.170
All right guys that's enough content advice.

198
00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:39.470
I'll see you in the next lecture.
