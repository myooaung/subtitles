00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.660
You get to crank it up a little bit and let's start talking about a package that costs a little bit

2
00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:06.480
more but can produce even higher quality videos.

3
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.340
Now this is to assume you have a little bit of experience with cameras lighting and sounding equipment

4
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.510
and really it can be a day of screwing around with it or just reading some review or tutorials online.

5
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.730
But generally speaking you probably know a little bit more.

6
00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.420
All right so let's imagine that you could spend 1000 to 2000.

7
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:24.770
OK.

8
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:25.860
So for a camera.

9
00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.200
Personally what I would do is I would kid the age for that.

10
00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:34.930
And this one and because of the five has come out.

11
00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.980
You can get this used for $800 $700.

12
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.020
I think it's worth it.

13
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:44.630
If you want to save a little bit more money what I would do is I would go with the Canon T-3.

14
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:45.940
I like the Rebel.

15
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.730
It's basically the base level model for DSL are those.

16
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:55.100
You can get packages of those to come with lenses and accessories for $400.

17
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.540
The camera itself has only 350.

18
00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.860
It has a smaller lens therefore the the video color is not as good as the megapixels actually going

19
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.670
be smaller but it can shoot pretty much 10 hp.

20
00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.850
Sometimes you might have a drop down to 720 P but same time there's plenty of people out there who shoot

21
00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.870
movies on T-3 eyes for the stands for your camera.

22
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:15.750
That's what I'd suggest.

23
00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.340
Just drop them 50 bucks and getting like a dollar.

24
00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.600
One I wouldn't necessarily go on to Amazon for buying nicer stands.

25
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.500
I'd probably go on to be in a photo dotcom.

26
00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:32.430
They have way more selection of camera equipment and if you just look in their tripod section just look

27
00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.410
for something like the 40 $60 range.

28
00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:36.930
Those are way better than for your lights.

29
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.870
I think you can actually move in Ltd's at this point.

30
00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:44.110
I think there's some pretty decent options for LCD panels.

31
00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:49.320
We can get two of them that are pretty dang bright for about five hundred dollars.

32
00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.970
I went through two different versions of this.

33
00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.480
I had to see the photo.

34
00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:56.720
Five hundred LCD light panels.

35
00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.080
Those were actually I think there quite a bit cheaper.

36
00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.870
They're about like $400.

37
00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:03.180
And those worked really well.

38
00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:09.270
The downsides were that they were actually pretty big and it's kind of a pain if I needed them for portability

39
00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.090
Oh out right now actually they're $200.

40
00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.630
That's really cheap.

41
00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.580
But they're big and clunky and durability is obviously an issue.

42
00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:23.550
However there are quite a bit more convenient than using big old soft boxes like we talked about in

43
00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.830
the lower package and it has been a little bit more.

44
00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:32.760
I used the studio pro They're called the double s 600 d ultra high power Ltds.

45
00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.650
When you're looking at Ltd's really just going to look for how many Ltd's it has.

46
00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.940
Right so if it's 600 what's a bigger panel than a 500 or 200.

47
00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:47.520
Generally speaking if you want to light one scene you've probably got at least five hundred like 250

48
00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.390
in each.

49
00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.290
You're going to do more people are brighter than you're going to need more panels.

50
00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.880
Those are great.

51
00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.210
I mean very low energy consumption.

52
00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.480
They're not a big deal.

53
00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.850
They are easy to move around especially that other one just gets into like the 506 and arranged the

54
00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.830
studio pros but they work pretty well.

55
00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.640
I still have mine.

56
00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.980
I shot all of my videos for become a product manager with those lights.

57
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.470
Actually worked pretty well at that point you might even start experimenting with things like running

58
00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.050
lights if you actually were interested in doing that.

59
00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:23.070
Ringlet it's can be as cheap as like 20 bucks 30 bucks but don't get those those are worthless.

60
00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.640
I would probably spend at least $100 if you actually were interested in using a ring like.

61
00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.780
And then when you get into Mikes I would suggest one of two things.

62
00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.950
One I would use the shotgun that I covered in the last one.

63
00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:37.580
It's the audio Technica Haiti 8 7 5 are.

64
00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:38.390
That's a great one.

65
00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:43.440
It's 170 box with the boom pole and a boom stand and they're only looking at like 220.

66
00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.600
That's a great shot going off in my opinion.

67
00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.740
I haven't explored anything else and shotguns because that just worked for me.

68
00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:56.340
Alternatively you can use like a zoom shotgun recorder and those are really really popular and what

69
00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:01.310
they do is they sit on top of the camera as opposed to hanging in front of someone.

70
00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:07.560
That's great for flexibility if you're walking outside recording and you're not in a set location having

71
00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.970
it mounted on top of your camera can be pretty helpful however because it's a shot gun it's going grab

72
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.940
anything that's right in front of it so you're not pointing directly at them.

73
00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.370
You can pick up a lot of weird stuff in general.

74
00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.390
Also if you're indoors it's much better to have a shock and that's close to your mouth as opposed to

75
00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:26.190
one that's trying to grab everything towards where you are because inevitably you're farther away from

76
00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:27.840
a camera than you are from your microphone.

77
00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:34.830
Now the other option you can do is a lot of clear and this is what I use and I would suggest it's called

78
00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.510
the audio Technica eighty eight nine nine.

79
00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:42.830
Got a sub miniature omni directional omni directional condenser level whatever.

80
00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.990
And so it's a wired lavalier that's about $270.

81
00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:52.170
In my experience is increase the quality of the lava in the air for that one is shockingly good.

82
00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:58.110
It's way more expensive than most Lob's and a lot of people will scoff because you spent more than $200

83
00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.770
on a lot of Llyr.

84
00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:04.690
But in experience you can get the same level of quality from this one as you can from a nice shotgun.

85
00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:09.520
So that was actually pretty shocking and I that's the one I've been using for a long time passed out

86
00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:15.700
what I would suggest doing is just getting as Zoom for recorder or that task cam recorder we talked

87
00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:16.690
about before.

88
00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:19.370
Zoom is easier just because it's it's more portable.

89
00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:25.150
However it has some battery issues so you might have to buy a converter for it to be able plug into

90
00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:25.540
the wall.

91
00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:30.610
You do it a double-A batteries bought it dies so often that it's not really reasonable.

92
00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:34.990
The Tascam one on the other hand has more battery but it's larger less portable on it a little bit more

93
00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:35.810
expensive.

94
00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:39.700
At this point also you might have a little bit of money left over so you can start playing around with

95
00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:43.120
like acoustic panels to pad your space.

96
00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:45.730
You can also they're playing around with things like cameras sliders.

97
00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:49.930
Basically what they are things you put your camera on and they slide back and forth which give you kind

98
00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:52.710
of a a nice kind of pan look.

99
00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:57.850
But generally speaking I would prefer to spend more of your money on the lights and the camera on things

100
00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:00.930
like that as opposed to going for more accessories this early on.

101
00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:05.280
I guess that total costs because in a land somewhere between like a thousand and 2000.

102
00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:09.420
So if you're in that range that's a really good package.

103
00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:14.590
I mean in terms of audio you're on the level with me in terms of video if you go at the G-8 for your

104
00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:15.480
on the same level.

105
00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:18.650
If you go to T-3 canon that's also quite good.

106
00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:23.320
This is pretty good if you want to go with like 1 person explainers or maybe even multiple person interviews.

107
00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:27.970
Now if you really have a budget and you really want to go serious with this and want to spend over say

108
00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:29.320
$3000.

109
00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.570
Well personally I would stick with JH for us.

110
00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:36.970
But what I would do instead is get two of them because it's really easy to up your production value

111
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.380
by having two cameras.

112
00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:39.880
It's the cheapest trip in the book.

113
00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:45.520
I mean it's an $800 trick but it can make it look like this is so much more professional when you switch

114
00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:47.450
from different angles back and forth.

115
00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:50.770
I found an educational content I think it's kind of distracting so I stopped doing it.

116
00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:58.030
But if you're making an interview or a client testimonial do they will look really sharp.

117
00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:02.740
Another option you can do for cameras that are if you really want to use Canon which I'm not a huge

118
00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:09.040
fan of because Canon just has a lot of restrictions like a Panasonic camera doesn't have.

119
00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:15.730
However Canon's have the best lenses so they go with Canon and what you can do is like a 5 d a can and

120
00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:18.140
5 is actually really popular.

121
00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:23.740
There are actually entire TV shows like your watch house that's actually shot on a Canon 5 d and that

122
00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:24.650
camera.

123
00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:29.410
Correct me if I'm wrong I think it's about $2000 so you could do that.

124
00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:32.950
And I think you maybe like get them cheaper for like 4300 used.

125
00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:33.250
I don't know.

126
00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:34.460
We'll throw it up on the screen.

127
00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:36.250
The prices obviously change as well.

128
00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:37.400
So just keep tabs on it.

129
00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:42.490
Then what I do is I would get a couple of those lava Lears that I mentioned I would get the shot gun

130
00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:47.530
undimensioned you could probably spend a little bit more on a nicer one if you wanted to and then pass

131
00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:49.150
that point for lights.

132
00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:53.350
What I would probably suggest is getting into what are called Keino flow lights.

133
00:07:53.380 --> 00:08:00.820
Those are kind of the industry standard for actual real productions I use Keino flow Terra's which are

134
00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:02.090
kind of a day.

135
00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:08.080
I don't know why I spent so much on lights but you can get two of those for something like $4000 if

136
00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:09.970
you really want to get serious about it.

137
00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:16.810
Alternatively you go with things like D-Va. lights or just to bank lights and you know you can spend

138
00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:18.860
$2000 on a light kit.

139
00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:24.550
Those are professional I mean they're great for you can dim them they create really really soft light

140
00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:29.760
they're really easy to use and that's why they're just so popular.

141
00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:34.660
Also at this point I might start throwing in some lenses I would alternate between some more narrow

142
00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:36.090
shots and wider shots.

143
00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:41.440
I would try to get at least like a Sigma fixed like a 30 millimeter.

144
00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:42.850
That's a great one.

145
00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:47.440
And if I wanted something a little bit more narrow I might go up like a 40 year if I wanted something

146
00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:48.430
more.

147
00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:50.770
Why am I going up to a 25 at this point.

148
00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:55.360
You can really start turning around a lot of stops you can get things like Sliders dollies of are called

149
00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:56.710
gybes.

150
00:08:56.740 --> 00:09:00.910
So these machines that hold your camera and then you can do swooping motions with them.

151
00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:01.450
You can.

152
00:09:01.450 --> 00:09:04.120
I mean the point you are messing with drones and all that stuff.

153
00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:05.560
But that's generally what I'd suggest.

154
00:09:05.650 --> 00:09:08.560
Look into the cheaper line of Keino floodlights.

155
00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:12.520
I'd probably go with multiple GCH 4s or five if you're interested.

156
00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:13.430
For some reason.

157
00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:19.650
Alternatively I could look at the Canon 5 DS and then for audio I'd probably stick with the same shotgun

158
00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:23.870
and I get multiple over the years in the case that you have multiple people on scene.

159
00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:27.880
Also that what you can really start getting some nicer sound panels ones actually look like they're

160
00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:33.310
decorations and you can put them in your living room and people won't even notice that they're used

161
00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:35.860
for soundproofing and they just look kind of decorative.

162
00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:36.380
All right guys.

163
00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:37.990
That's not information overload.

164
00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:41.500
Pick which one you think you fit into if you're not sure.

165
00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:43.820
Start at the lower end and work your way up.

166
00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:47.980
That's in my experience kind of the best combinations I've found.

167
00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:52.540
Now obviously infinite combinations get try every single one and obviously I'm biased towards certain

168
00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:56.950
brands but the point is you just need to get to a certain outcome.

169
00:09:56.950 --> 00:09:59.290
There's multiple roads that get there then who cares anyway.

170
00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:01.760
So there you go lots of options depending on what you want.

171
00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:05.710
Just make sure that you read the ratings and you make your own decisions.

172
00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:09.330
But if you want a template now that I've pretty much given it to you.

173
00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:10.430
All right guys that's it for now.

174
00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:11.360
I'll see you in the next lecture.
