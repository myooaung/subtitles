00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:02.260
Right we are back.

2
00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:05.370
So our last lecture talked about the wonderful world of rough cuts.

3
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.870
That's really your first step when it comes to editing together a video.

4
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.750
When you do a rough cut a lot of times you leave out any elaborate elements you plan on adding later.

5
00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:18.990
For example you might plan on creating a cool intro titles and graphics and stuff but the rough cut

6
00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.670
is just a quick throwing together of a working version of the main part of your video.

7
00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.590
Now a lot of times in fact editors leave the intros and outros and other more elaborate pieces for the

8
00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.970
end when they can actually devote more time if they don't have to worry about the rest of it being in

9
00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:33.540
disarray.

10
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.700
However one way to speed up the process of creating these elements is to use templates and this is what

11
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:39.860
I want to cover in this lecture.

12
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.270
Now video templates are usually available in any of the editing programs you use.

13
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.860
The makers of these programs know that whether people are making ads explainer videos walkthrough whatever

14
00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.500
that those videos have common pieces to them specifically.

15
00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.300
Many videos and include intros lower thirds or things like slideshows.

16
00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.880
Now of course don't rely too much on these templates that are built into the programs because oftentimes

17
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:07.710
they can look cheap because people will recognize them because they're so overused it often looks like

18
00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.530
you put the minimal amount of effort into it.

19
00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.160
It's like when you read someone's paper and it's written in that font that everybody associates with

20
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:19.320
Microsoft Word you know Calibra the you see Calibra fonts like wow you didn't even think about changing

21
00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.620
the font you just went with the default that was given to you.

22
00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.680
Anyway back to some of those things I mentioned intro's lower thirds and slideshows Well intro titles.

23
00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:31.470
Nothing I just mentioned are pieces of video that run at the beginning of explainers or podcasts or

24
00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:37.020
other episodes of series of videos is basically what you see before movies and TV episodes as well.

25
00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.450
They include titles of some kind as well as some animated funkiness graphics music other pieces of video

26
00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.250
you name it just so you can see what I mean.

27
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:51.150
I can throw up one of the ones that we use right now for my lectures you might have seen it.

28
00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.780
I'm not sure.

29
00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.310
Now there's multiple ways you can call these things I call them intro's Sometimes they're called bumpers

30
00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:08.280
because they're put at the very beginning and end of your clips like kind of like book ends but technically

31
00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.610
they're like intro titles.

32
00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.890
Now they can be done in so many different ways but at their core it's usually just a list of words and

33
00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.490
names a show and some kind of cool way.

34
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.900
It's also usually pretty short.

35
00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.920
People generally hate it when it goes say longer than like eight seconds.

36
00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.870
So these intro titles are a common type of template you will often find.

37
00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.200
Then what you've got are called lower thirds which is a classic type of graphic dating back to the early

38
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.220
days of television.

39
00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.610
Laura thirds are graphics that get displayed you can get it in the lower third part of your screen.

40
00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:42.930
They're used to show the name and title of someone or a location name or these days it could be I don't

41
00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.190
know to repeat any important statements or tips that are being described by the speaker it could be

42
00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.920
really anything.

43
00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.050
Now again this is a text based in fact that lots of people have created templates for so there's a lot

44
00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:56.640
of variations in it also wouldn't be surprised if you see me doing this and a lot of my lectures.

45
00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.860
And then you've got slideshows which yes can be a series of pictures shown in sequence on screen but

46
00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.050
they can also be used to show video clips.

47
00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.760
So instead of tax being the important content display it's pictures or videos where you've got some

48
00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.070
animated effect or some split screen type things happening.

49
00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.700
There are a lot of ways to show your various visuals on screen.

50
00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.530
So in case you're still wondering why use templates rather than learn how to create all of these effects

51
00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:20.780
sequences yourself.

52
00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.450
You can take advantage of the expertise others have.

53
00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:24.500
It's fantastic.

54
00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.240
Saves you an enormous amount of time.

55
00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.600
A lot of times all you have to do is drag and drop your own video onto the parts of the template where

56
00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:35.190
it goes and your work is done or you put it in and then you select the attributes and then type in the

57
00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:40.980
text where you need it and obviously saves time and money and it does oftentimes at a professional nice

58
00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:41.800
little touch to it.

59
00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:45.620
Assuming you do it well and you don't pick the cheesiest one you can find.

60
00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.840
Plus if you use templates to do the cooler more work intensive parts of your video like the intro the

61
00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:54.870
outro for example you can devote your attention to the main part of your video and focus on making that

62
00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:55.830
as good as possible.

63
00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.670
Leave the elaborate graphics and effects to the professionals out there creating this template.

64
00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.180
So where can we find them.

65
00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:06.680
Well I've actually showed you examples of templates for a Web site called motion or a dot com.

66
00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:11.370
Last I checked while they had something like 700 templates you could use in Premiere and they include

67
00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.860
things like Logo sequences slideshows lower thirds and some other really funky other things.

68
00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.570
There are also design studios out there that create those templates.

69
00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:24.510
Rampant design is an example of a design city that sells more premium templates along with motion graphics

70
00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:25.220
and other fun stuff.

71
00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:30.810
You can add your premier projects if you guys work with Final Cut Pro there is motion VFX where they

72
00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.280
had a lot of templates but also special effects.

73
00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.150
You can also get a lot of templates on Web sites like theme forest.

74
00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:42.030
That's one it'll usually take you to things like graphic jungle or something like that.

75
00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:46.730
They have a bunch of sub brands underneath that but the forest is a good place to start.

76
00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:51.550
In other words off the top of my head is in Vado marketplace throat up here on screen.

77
00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:56.610
Here's another place where you can buy things like opening sequences and closing sequences.

78
00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:03.270
You can also just google free intro to are free bumpers free intro free outros things like that.

79
00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:06.170
There are some free ones out there that you can get.

80
00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:07.460
And yeah they're decent.

81
00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:11.690
Now if you have a specific need look a style or a look in a google search should help you find what

82
00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:12.440
you need.

83
00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:16.340
Or you can use an existing template and added it to better reflect what you want.

84
00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:20.340
But again you can outsource this work instead of trying to find the perfect template.

85
00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:24.650
You also find someone on a freelance website like fiver for example and tell them hey here's this great

86
00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:28.790
template on motional Ray that I love but I need something that better matches my company and style and

87
00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:31.030
I prefer the sequence to be faster.

88
00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:32.620
My colors actually.

89
00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:34.040
Let's change the motion here.

90
00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:38.750
Put in my logo whatever you give specific direction on what you want exactly.

91
00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:43.170
There's tons of freelancers that actually specialize in just editing these templates for you.

92
00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:45.950
We actually discuss outsourcing video work and the next lecture.

93
00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:47.540
That sounds like a plan to you.

94
00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:52.490
So one other benefit of templates is once you have a template you like and it works you can use as much

95
00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:53.060
as you want.

96
00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:55.070
Use your entire template just before every video.

97
00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:56.130
Not just one.

98
00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:59.120
Establish a style for lower thirds that you can use in all your videos.

99
00:05:59.120 --> 00:05:59.990
Not just one.

100
00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:04.850
In other words if you buy a template or outsource the creation of one or at least the customization

101
00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:07.040
of one use it a lot and get your money's worth.

102
00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.170
Generally speaking buying templates is pretty simple.

103
00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:13.730
Go to any of these Web sites that I've mentioned throw some in the resources you generally just download

104
00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:19.610
them and then you can literally drag and drop it into Premier or final cut pro and it'll pop up on your

105
00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:22.920
timeline or you can import it by going to file and then import.

106
00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:24.550
But that's actually a long way of doing it.

107
00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:25.340
You can't figure it out.

108
00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:26.520
You need to customize it again.

109
00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:27.750
That's why fire is so great.

110
00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:29.600
Can then five bucks and do it for you.

111
00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:30.830
Anyway guys that's it.

112
00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:31.730
See you next lecture.
