Hey guys welcome back to the course and welcome to the new section on landing pages and lead magnets.

2
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.290
I don't know if you've heard of these concepts before but they're two things that work together really

3
00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:16.740
really well especially if you're interested in building up a list and then trying to sell your services

4
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.710
sell your products to that list.

5
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.570
That's probably one of the easiest ways to go out there and make a repeatable process of getting leads.

6
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.080
It is a little bit saturated nowadays.

7
00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.560
I will miss it but we couldn't really leave it out of the chorus because it still works really well.

8
00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.840
So what are landing pages and lead magnets.

9
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:34.510
Exactly.

10
00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.510
Well let me ask you this.

11
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.380
Have you ever tried to let's say download an e-book or sign up for free webinars.

12
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.570
Well if so what exactly did you have to do first.

13
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.420
Well you probably filled out a form those forms ask for things like personal information like maybe

14
00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.510
your name email address and sometimes stuff like company name phone number or you know whatever kind

15
00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.520
of business you're end once you feel that form out and submit it you'll get what's promised your e-book

16
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.180
or white paper or whatever.

17
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:06.190
Well that form and all that information about the thing you want in return is usually found Honda on

18
00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:07.430
the landing page.

19
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:13.050
Now l'Anglais just called that because many people land there from links included in ads emails or other

20
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.400
calls to action a landing page is an independent entity.

21
00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:21.960
It's usually separated from someone's home page and it's usually just one page on a landing page the

22
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.670
primary goal is to get people to take an action whether it's a complete a form sign up for an event

23
00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:27.980
or something like that.

24
00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.280
They are usually focused solely on one thing.

25
00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.150
That's also why they're often called squeeze pages because they'll squeeze the viewer into doing one

26
00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.190
very very specific thing for marketers landing pages are incredibly useful because you're pitching a

27
00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.640
new service or you want people to sign up for one very specific thing.

28
00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.500
Well then what's better than to make a page that only talks on that one singular thing and only ask

29
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.540
them to do one thing.

30
00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:56.280
That way when you watch people come to your page you know exactly what they're responding to it's not

31
00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.520
as if they go to their home page got confused about all the different pages and buttons they can click.

32
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.390
In that case you wouldn't be able to associate that confusion or disinterest with any one product on

33
00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.050
your page.

34
00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:12.050
Now in the theoretical scenario once they complete let's say the form on the landing page Well now they're

35
00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.960
a lead for whatever web site you just signed up for.

36
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.660
Now someone in that business can contact you with some kind of marketing messaging some promotions e-mails

37
00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.860
and usually invites to more related things they think that the lead might want.

38
00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.500
And what about that thing you download more.

39
00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.660
You know the webinars that you get to attend now.

40
00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.600
Well that valuable piece of content is what we have called a lead magnet.

41
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.670
It's the promise of that value that attracts people like a magnet and gets them to give up their e-mail

42
00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:39.990
and agree to be marketed to.

43
00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.550
So basically like dangling something shiny or a piece of candy in front of someone and then when they

44
00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.950
reach for it you say no tell me your name first.

45
00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.720
Are you.

46
00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:55.320
You know not me you get I'm you just ask the damn question is why you and you use up you.

47
00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.140
Yes you should pay me.

48
00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.870
Yes.

49
00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.800
I am me.

50
00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.850
Here's to me and I'm you and you'll always me because I'm sick of playing games.

51
00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.620
I you as a business are giving away something of value to get something of value back.

52
00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.140
Now creating lead magnets and serving them up and landing pages can be a great opportunity to grow your

53
00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.890
customer base.

54
00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.330
So much is ahead.

55
00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:20.220
We're going to talk about how you can prep your own compelling landing pages and create lead magnets

56
00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.420
of your own so you can.
