Hey guys, welcome back to the course. In this lecture,
we're going to talk about origin source sorting.
1

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,850
Now, this is one of the most important concepts in 
Google Analytics, because understanding it will help
2

3
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:13,260
you figure out which one of the 19 traction 
channels we went over earlier is working for you.
3

4
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:17,370
Now, do you remember those or do I need 
to grab my shocker pen again? No,
4

5
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:20,610
I'm definitely not going to do that, so if you don't remember,
5

6
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:24,510
can we just throw it up on the screen? 
Can we throw it up on the screen, please?
6

7
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:24,740
Okay, thank you.
7

8
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:25,300
Okay, thank you.
8

9
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,650
So what exactly is origin source sorting?
9

10
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:32,580
Well, that's where you figure out where your 
traffic originated from, hence origin source,
10

11
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:38,010
and then you sort it, so they aren't all lumped together in one 
giant masked anonymous group, like the band Slipknot.
11

12
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:38,750
and then you sort it, so they aren't all lumped together in one 
giant masked anonymous group, like the band Slipknot.
12

13
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,610
Luckily, we just learned about Google Analytics,
where we can do this relatively easily.
13

14
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:44,970
And since we kind of blew right through it in the lecture,
14

15
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:46,650
let's go into a little bit more detail.
15

16
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:46,860
All right.
16

17
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:49,190
So this should look a bit familiar.
17

18
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,890
It's the Audience Overview screen that Google Analytics 
always starts off. When it comes to origins source sorting,
18

19
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:54,420
It's the Audience Overview screen that Google Analytics 
always starts off. When it comes to origins source sorting,
19

20
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,120
we want to be in the Acquisition section.
20

21
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:01,620
There's the pie graph we saw before, and when we scroll 
down we see bar graphs with the same information. Yay
21

22
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:07,090
for graphs! The information on the overview 
screen is, well, basically just an overview.
22

23
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:11,880
We're going to want to go a little deeper to learn more 
about where we're acquiring customers, which,
23

24
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:15,290
again, is why we're in the Acquisitions section to begin with.
24

25
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:18,900
For example, if I wanted to learn which 
social network is working the best for me,
25

26
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:22,110
well, then I could click on Social and then figure that out.
26

27
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:26,450
It might be the case that your traffic 
from Instagram is not buying,
27

28
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:27,800
whereas your traffic from Facebook is. 
Without doing this, you would never know that.
28

29
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:30,240
whereas your traffic from Facebook is. 
Without doing this, you would never know that.
29

30
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,400
Now, here there's a breakdown of the different social 
networks where people discovered my project, 25
30

31
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,640
days of ideas. Now, it looks like Twitter is far 
and away the top origin source for social.
31

32
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:42,750
I don't know why that is. So that's 
great, but we can go even deeper.
32

33
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:46,360
We can filter the data down even more 
by adding a secondary dimension.
33

34
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:50,700
Now, this basically means we're going to add another column 
with an additional filter applied so we can hopefully
34

35
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:55,110
figure out which channel is the best, since the total 
number of users doesn't really tell me the whole story.
35

36
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:55,680
figure out which channel is the best, since the total 
number of users doesn't really tell me the whole story.
36

37
00:01:55,710 --> 00:02:00,540
So we can slice the data up even more to help us learn more
about the users that are coming from different sources.
37

38
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:01,210
So we can slice the data up even more to help us learn more
about the users that are coming from different sources.
38

39
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:05,140
I wanted to know which social network 
was acquiring my most engaging users,
39

40
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:09,220
I could add a secondary dimension like, 
let's say, I don't know, session duration,
40

41
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,520
so then I could see how long the users 
stayed on my site before they left.
41

42
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,370
And we see that some people immediately 
left at the sight of my face. I'm sorry.
42

43
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:16,020
And we see that some people immediately 
left at the sight of my face. I'm sorry.
43

44
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:20,490
Now, some of these secondary dimensions are more 
useful than others, and some may even require exporting
44

45
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:24,110
the data into a spreadsheet to really drill 
down on the information you're looking for.
45

46
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:28,050
It really just depends on what you're trying to learn 
and how much time you're willing to spend on it
46

47
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:28,830
to figure it out.
47

48
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:32,490
So if you find yourself wanting to know a little bit more or you 
have a question you think can be answered with the data,
48

49
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:33,480
So if you find yourself wanting to know a little bit more or you 
have a question you think can be answered with the data,
49

50
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:37,740
you can browse through the menu and see if there's a secondary 
dimension that might help you get to that answer more easily.
50

51
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:38,470
you can browse through the menu and see if there's a secondary 
dimension that might help you get to that answer more easily.
51

52
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:43,580
OK, but social is kind of an obvious example, since 
there are only a handful of social sites out there.
52

53
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:47,640
And Google Analytics does a decent job of tracking 
all the different social channels right out of the
53

54
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,010
box without you having to do that much.
54

55
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:53,990
Now, let's talk a little bit about this elephant 
in the room back on the overview page.
55

56
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:59,160
I'm talking about the biggest number, which is labeled 
Direct. So direct is supposed to mean that users
56

57
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:02,970
are directly typing in your website URL,
57

58
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:08,910
but there's absolutely no way that 
5,820 people did that on 25 days of
58

59
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:11,730
ideas, which just launched last month.
59

60
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:14,440
So there must be something else going on here.
60

61
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:19,880
When I click into it, I can see that the bulk of the traffic 
came directly to my home page at the25daysofideas.com,
61

62
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,370
When I click into it, I can see that the bulk of the traffic 
came directly to my home page at the25daysofideas.com,
62

63
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,730
that's what just the slash there means.
63

64
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:27,430
But again, this cannot possibly be people 
actually typing it into their browsers.
64

65
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:33,390
And that is because Google will also show just the
slash when they click on a link from an e-mail, or
65

66
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:39,760
from a text, or from Slack, or from when their, you know,
grandma sent it to them in an AOL Instant Message.
66

67
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:45,210
Basically, Google sort of treats direct as a catch all for 
when they can't determine exactly who the referrer is.
67

68
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:46,440
Basically, Google sort of treats direct as a catch all for 
when they can't determine exactly who the referrer is.
68

69
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:52,020
So how do we figure out where all these other direct users are 
coming from, since they're probably not all typing in the URL?
69

70
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:53,390
So how do we figure out where all these other direct users are 
coming from, since they're probably not all typing in the URL?
70

71
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:56,850
Well, unfortunately, you can't control it that much.
71

72
00:03:56,850 --> 00:04:01,590
My best guess is that a large amount of them are 
coming from the daily e-mails that go out to users
72

73
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:07,290
who subscribed. Now, if only there was a better way 
for me to track those users from the daily e-mails.
73

74
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:13,020
Well, stay tuned to the next lecture, where we talk about 
what I should have done better to help understand
74

75
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,420
the people that are getting to my site.
75

76
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,740
OK guys, I'll see you then.
