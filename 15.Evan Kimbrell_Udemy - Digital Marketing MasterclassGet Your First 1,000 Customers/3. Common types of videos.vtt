00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:01.790
Hey guys welcome back.

2
00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.100
So in our last lecture we asked the question do you need video.

3
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.460
Video has advantages and it has disadvantages to it no doubt.

4
00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:12.950
But in my opinion it's worth generally checking it out.

5
00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:18.250
Obviously I'm here talking to you about the benefits of video in a video so I might be biased.

6
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.580
Really you just need to think about whether or not it's suited for your audience and what you're doing.

7
00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.210
Are you using video to enhance your content and does it work.

8
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.490
Or are you just using video because video.

9
00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.010
Now I'm talking to you right now and what you would call a tutorial.

10
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:39.540
But that's one type of video and this lecture run to cover more of the common types of videos you see

11
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.910
in video and content marketing.

12
00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.660
Now I should give you some ideas for types of videos you might want to create yourself.

13
00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.120
So first of all if you're going to talk about videos and marketing we have to mention at video advertisements

14
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:57.530
are basically commercials usually created to promote something most likely to try and sell something.

15
00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.200
So we've all seen answer products or movies or online services.

16
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.910
Right.

17
00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:03.510
They're pretty much everywhere.

18
00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.330
Well here's another wrinkle.

19
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:13.010
Usually people see ads in voluntarily as in they don't choose to watch it they don't want to watch ads.

20
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.170
They want to watch what comes on after a hard and sometimes now before the act.

21
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.580
Now the ad might show up as pre-roll which means it will play before the video you've actually clicked

22
00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.910
on and then it might play as post roll because of the very end of the video really.

23
00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:28.270
Oh.

24
00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.580
Is there something else I need to watch.

25
00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.100
Like it's just an ad so you might sit through today like a pre-roll ad before you get to watch that

26
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:41.760
cat video that you originally came to YouTube for or on the ESPN Web site for you get to watch the highlights

27
00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.380
from the ballgame you're trying to watch now.

28
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:51.090
Ads are promotional and really they're just kind of an extension of running ads in general just a way

29
00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.700
of spicing up how you get your information out there.

30
00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.400
And also it opens up more opportunities to get your information to your audience.

31
00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:04.290
You know you put an ad on Google search results but the only reason so many people and so many frames

32
00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:10.500
of mind if you wanted to get on YouTube or get on ESPN dot com or something else like that well then

33
00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.560
you're going to have to use video now since ads are usually involuntary.

34
00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.190
That's why they need to be short.

35
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.870
They're usually 30 to 60 seconds long.

36
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.770
Now it's about all people can really handle of an involuntary ad unless it's really really good online.

37
00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:31.020
Now ads might be as short as 15 seconds because that's a lot easier to click away from the video than

38
00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.540
get up from your couch and leave the television.

39
00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.950
I mean who really wants to watch ads right.

40
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.720
Well think about ads is that they can be really effective when they follow a common type of model.

41
00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.310
Now we might have covered this earlier in the course.

42
00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.530
Not entirely sure but it's something that marketers follow and it's very very well known it's called

43
00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:56.040
the item model and it's a idea a it's an acronym that stands for attention interest desire and action.

44
00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:01.060
Now it's basically the four things you're trying to get from the viewer when you create an ad.

45
00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.150
So is this something people will use and they write like sales e-mails or even just landing pages.

46
00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:11.440
And if you follow this model generally speaking you get good results it's considered a best practice.

47
00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:16.890
So here's generally how it works and as an example we've got this Nintendo switch 30 second commercial

48
00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.960
to help us demonstrate the ITA model.

49
00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.180
All right so let's watch the video and I'll see you in a second.

50
00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.790
This is a

51
00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.520
legend of zelda.

52
00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:52.860
Why switch switching play Nintendo switch rated every 110 and now attention means you have to catch

53
00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.780
the viewers in the first few seconds.

54
00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:00.570
It might be an interesting looking visual or a bold word or phrase on the screen or it could be a question

55
00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:01.610
that gets people thinking.

56
00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.760
So in our ad Nintendo flashes their switch logo at the beginning.

57
00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.390
Who what is that they're trying to get your attention.

58
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.020
Now the next part of Ida is interest which means making them aware of the product or service they're

59
00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.720
promoting.

60
00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:15.420
What are you advertising here.

61
00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.740
Follow up the beginning of the video where you got the viewers attention by connecting this all to the

62
00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:22.940
need the viewer has and then promise more value to come.

63
00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.770
So in the ad we launched some gamer wake up and play on a device around his apartment.

64
00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.670
Looks like he is like Zelda so that's cool.

65
00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:30.780
Is this the switch.

66
00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.370
You know what I am interested.

67
00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:33.640
Tell me more now.

68
00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:39.270
The D in ited needs desire and desire means you have to make them want the product.

69
00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:45.180
Now you mind the re are generally of their need by stating their solution your product your service

70
00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.120
whatever it is that's enticing to begin with.

71
00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.760
Now this is where you show the real value in store for the viewer.

72
00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:55.310
So back to our AD What did they do to entice you to actually want to be purchases.

73
00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:59.210
Well we launched the game replugged device into something and now the game is on the TV.

74
00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.820
Wow that's actually kind of new now maybe I'm actually interested that something novel.

75
00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:09.180
The last thing is action and action just means telling them how to get it without action.

76
00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:12.750
You just got their attention you arouse them and then you did nothing.

77
00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.550
In this case it's like visit this website.

78
00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:19.760
Call this number go to the store tell them exactly where to find the product so it can be theirs.

79
00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:24.060
Presumably today you know Nintendo flashes the release date and you are up on the screen at the very

80
00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:24.690
end.

81
00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:25.140
Perfect.

82
00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:28.890
Now I know when this thing is available maybe I can preorder it at this Web site.

83
00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:34.230
So it's a good example of the item model and in general we think about ads and especially video marketing

84
00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:34.810
ads.

85
00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:36.780
We kind of have to stick to that.

86
00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:42.870
You need to hit every single part of that get their attention get them interested hook them and convince

87
00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:45.530
them that they want whatever it is that you're selling them.

88
00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:49.230
And then finally tell them how to relieve that stress and then buy it.

89
00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:53.580
Now of course ads work best when the show to the right audience the people who would actually want the

90
00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:57.870
product you're promoting and would be willing to buy it some day if you can get your hands in front

91
00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:58.690
of the right audience.

92
00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:01.590
There is a better chance we'll take that action at the end of your AD.

93
00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:06.770
So those are ads just one type of video marketing do you yourself run ads.

94
00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:07.260
OK.

95
00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:12.300
Well could you enhance them with video if you can handsom with video and you legitimately think video

96
00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:18.300
can do a better job than your stale text ads or sales pages or whatever then this is actually a good

97
00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:22.650
opportunity for you now another type of video you might use to help create awareness of your product

98
00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:25.580
or brand is what we call the explainer video.

99
00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:30.720
Now explainer videos I'm sure you've seen them there's a bit Jilian of them out there but they're created

100
00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:31.980
to answer questions.

101
00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:38.900
Usually in some variety of like how to do something or this is what this product does.

102
00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:43.800
And and now in fact a lot of companies feature an explainer video right on their home page to explain

103
00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:50.700
themselves who they are what they do and why people should actually care to use usually are going to

104
00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:55.800
run two or three minutes of there's enough detail to make it interesting but not really so long that

105
00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:56.730
you might get bored.

106
00:06:56.790 --> 00:07:01.620
Now what's interesting is that you can use an item model we just talked about before in your explainer

107
00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:02.120
video.

108
00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:08.100
So if the goal of your two explainer is to explain you know your productivity app for example the item

109
00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:13.800
model works here too as well because Lycan and you're trying to get the audience to take a specific

110
00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:14.450
action.

111
00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:20.400
Now brands might also create more explainer videos if their goal is to share expertise and get themselves

112
00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:22.450
known as a helpful source of information.

113
00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:28.290
A lot of startups for instance offer online services will create explainer videos because they can explain

114
00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:33.540
multiple concepts quickly while at the same time showing off their platform in one sense explain how

115
00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:35.360
videos are kind of like a short blog post.

116
00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:37.770
You might write but you know in the video form.

117
00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:43.490
Actually there are some blog posts that write the post and produce it as a video as well as a company

118
00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:48.820
we reference a lot and reference a lot of the section called wisdom and wisdom does this a lot we see

119
00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:51.310
is a video hosting an analytics company.

120
00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:54.220
They're decently well-known in the industry.

121
00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:59.290
They're probably best known for the level of analytics they can give you on your video plays.

122
00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:04.320
Well you know since their services all deal with video then it makes sense that they've created a library

123
00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:08.410
full of high quality videos explaining all of these related topics.

124
00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:11.280
I really like explainer videos because they're a happy medium.

125
00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:16.500
You know they're not too long in the not too short and you can focus on one important topic or you can

126
00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:21.060
take it as an opportunity to tackle the whole question of what my product does or who we are.

127
00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:24.510
OK so those are explainer video as you see them all the time.

128
00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:30.420
They started off as kind of those fake whiteboard videos and then they became this kind of cheap cartoon

129
00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:35.550
look where you can explain something really easily and cheaply and it kind of looks really I don't know

130
00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:36.310
nice.

131
00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:43.590
And now there's a lot of software out there that help you do it like Sparkle and like pow tune and whatever

132
00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:45.240
but the category is really expanded.

133
00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:51.470
And now you see live action explainers where people just tackle one topic and clean it from beginning

134
00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:56.600
to end or they say like this is our company and this is our video explaining what our company and product

135
00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:57.100
does.

136
00:08:57.110 --> 00:09:02.150
Now if you're the type that's creating a lot of educational content or you're in situations where people

137
00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:07.520
come to you looking to fix something or they have cumen as well explainer videos could be an interesting

138
00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:08.080
option.

139
00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:10.940
In that type of video is the product demo video.

140
00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:13.580
Now you'll probably guess what this one is but I'll explain it anyway.

141
00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:18.140
This is a video where you show off your product by demonstrating what it can do including its most important

142
00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:18.760
features.

143
00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:23.930
So instead of focusing on one problem like in an explainer video you get to show multiple things your

144
00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:24.680
product can do.

145
00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:27.200
And also people get to see you interacting with it.

146
00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:32.150
The idea here is to build on the information you might have given in an introductory explainer video

147
00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:37.190
and then perhaps go a little bit deeper in what ways does your product handle the multiple problems

148
00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:40.810
the user might face during the day what multiple task can handle.

149
00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:43.470
How does it integrate with other products the customer might use.

150
00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:47.020
In general how does this product make the customer's life easier.

151
00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:50.990
All of those questions are something you'd ask when you're further along in your buying process and

152
00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:52.700
starting to narrow down options.

153
00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:57.890
So a product demo gives an in-depth look at what you might be buying or signing up for.

154
00:09:57.890 --> 00:10:02.960
Now remember how ads might be 30 to 60 seconds long and then explainers are generally a little bit longer.

155
00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:06.470
All product demos are generally a little bit longer than both of those.

156
00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:07.670
How long exactly.

157
00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:10.300
Well it just kind of depends on how complex your product is.

158
00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:14.870
But it would make sense to break up your product demos into like five or 10 minute pieces if you had

159
00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:16.240
multiple reasons that demo it.

160
00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:20.990
Of course if you're a company that makes luggage more backpacks or something and you're making a demo

161
00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:26.270
about your backpack Well I don't think you could talk about it for five minutes less it had a hundred

162
00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:28.870
and one feature so maybe then it might be a little bit shorter.

163
00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:34.430
As an example of that check out the site here in San Francisco till Timbuktu for each video they have

164
00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:37.160
a video of a guy who literally just goes this is the backpack.

165
00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:39.570
Check out the thing you touched it with my hand.

166
00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:40.360
Back to you.

167
00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:42.860
Another an example of those go to Patagonia.

168
00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:49.370
Patagonia has videos on every single page where a guy interacts with the jacket like puts it on says

169
00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:53.940
how warm it is and then it hits you with a bunch of buzzwords like never live.

170
00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:55.160
Pluck duck feathers.

171
00:10:55.160 --> 00:11:00.110
So for productivity videos let's say for example your productivity app and you had a few things you

172
00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:02.830
wanted to demo for people considering it for purchase.

173
00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:08.230
You got a group of really cool features that help everyday users so those could use some explanation.

174
00:11:08.270 --> 00:11:12.680
Then you've got let's say integration options because your app can connect with other apps and automate

175
00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:13.550
some stuff.

176
00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:19.310
So maybe that could use a demo itself and then you know there's the whatever really cool stuff it could

177
00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:22.500
do with like the wearables or the fit bits or the Apple Watches.

178
00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:24.260
So then maybe you have a separate video for that.

179
00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:28.340
Now all of that stuff would be too hard to cover in one video so it might be better to take three separate

180
00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:30.810
ones but they're kind of the same thing.

181
00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:35.120
That way the customers have interest in productivity and they have a specific need like they're big

182
00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:36.100
into automation.

183
00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:40.160
Then they can drill down right to the demo that makes the most sense for them.

184
00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:41.800
So product demos can be pretty cool.

185
00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:46.730
But one way to use video that really demonstrates that something works for the show costumer is to show

186
00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:48.200
how a customer uses it.

187
00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:51.270
So for another type of video we're going to explore for a second.

188
00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:54.260
You might create is called a customer testimonial video.

189
00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:59.090
Now this is where you bring in a customer or you go to their business and get them on video telling

190
00:11:59.090 --> 00:12:02.150
everyone how awesome your stuff is and explaining why.

191
00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:06.560
And then when no one's looking you slip them a check behind the camera for all the explanations you

192
00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:10.970
can give how great your product is some customers out there would rather hear it from someone that's

193
00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:12.110
actually use it.

194
00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:15.560
Now that's why testimonial videos really can be quite powerful.

195
00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:21.440
Testimonials don't even have to be that long maybe three to five minutes but it can depend on how complex

196
00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:22.870
the product is actually.

197
00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:25.770
And if you can get a lot of good information from the customer.

198
00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:30.710
So if you were to identify one of your early customers or one that's been willing to talk to you about

199
00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:34.240
their experience you could approach them to tell their story on video.

200
00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:36.130
It basically works like any other written case study.

201
00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:40.640
If you have a read or written one before well you know you have the customer introduce themselves then

202
00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:42.840
they explain the original problem they're facing.

203
00:12:42.890 --> 00:12:44.960
Why were they were looking for a solution.

204
00:12:45.050 --> 00:12:50.030
How this interaction what they do then they can tell you what other alternatives maybe they considered

205
00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:53.830
or tried before landing on your amazing product slash service.

206
00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:58.550
Then they can kind of go into how easy it is to use or how to improve their lives in some measurable

207
00:12:58.550 --> 00:13:03.150
way by letting customers tell their story it adds these elements of trust and reliability or product.

208
00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:08.510
Again it means a lot for these positive things to be coming from people outside your business so if

209
00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:12.740
a customer has a good story to tell and you can get them on video that's something you could possibly

210
00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:13.220
do.

211
00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:16.850
Now generally speaking video testimonials are just better.

212
00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:23.000
How many times have you read a page you read or written testimonial or a quote and then compare that

213
00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.680
to whatever you've read a page and it had a video testimonial video testimonial you know might be a

214
00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:28.460
little cheesy.

215
00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:32.270
You're more likely to believe that person who's telling that story versus some quote from someone you've

216
00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:32.940
never heard of.

217
00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:34.970
I can put up fake quotes all the time.

218
00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:36.820
I could quote anyone and just put it up there.

219
00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:38.430
You don't know for a fact they said that.

220
00:13:38.450 --> 00:13:43.130
Now videos like customer testimonials and product demos can help a lot with people narrowing down their

221
00:13:43.130 --> 00:13:45.770
choices and looking for evidence to help them make that decision.

222
00:13:45.770 --> 00:13:49.740
Now another type of video that could help is what we call a walk through video.

223
00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:56.260
Now a product demo video is what introduces key features but the walk through video then takes you through

224
00:13:56.290 --> 00:13:58.980
each feature and explains them step by step.

225
00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:03.520
Walk Through these are especially helpful when you have a product with complex functionality or a platform

226
00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:04.330
with multiple steps.

227
00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:06.520
You might have to go through to get things done.

228
00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:10.660
Generally speaking explainer videos are going to be displayed before someone buys something and they're

229
00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:16.060
kind of a quick overview go cruising speed over all the cool things you can do then a walkthrough is

230
00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:17.740
generally after they've bought it.

231
00:14:17.770 --> 00:14:21.460
Hey here's how you actually use the product and get the most out of it.

232
00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:26.080
So think of a product like Google Analytics right here we're going to Google Analytics you know it can

233
00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:28.420
be pretty overwhelming from the get go.

234
00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:33.280
But if Google produce an instructional walkthrough video like getting started with Google Analytics

235
00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:35.500
I don't actually know if they have a video like this.

236
00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:37.500
More people might be willing to jump in.

237
00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:42.320
Now I found one Google did on their small business YouTube channel from year a couple of years ago.

238
00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:46.810
But you know I get why they don't produce walkthrough is more often the google analytics platform is

239
00:14:46.810 --> 00:14:51.250
really detailed and it would take a lot of walk through videos to cover it all.

240
00:14:51.250 --> 00:14:57.560
Plus features might change in there or the layouts will change or the buttons and such are.

241
00:14:57.700 --> 00:15:03.610
So you'd have to redo the videos constantly in order for them to be accurate and that there can be a

242
00:15:03.610 --> 00:15:06.730
major hassle and somebody to take into consideration of these videos.

243
00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:08.510
So in that sense they can be a pain.

244
00:15:08.590 --> 00:15:13.000
Generally speaking from the company's perspective you might consider walking through videos if you need

245
00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:20.980
to increase engagement in your product or get people to sign up more for something or try a new feature.

246
00:15:21.010 --> 00:15:25.440
It's usually stuff like that to raise their satisfaction raise their engagement.

247
00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:28.150
And that oftentimes is tied to your bottom line.

248
00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:32.680
Usually what ends up happening though is you let those walk through is be available to anyone.

249
00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:37.210
So someone who doesn't have the product might still see the walkthrough and that might still be convincing

250
00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:38.290
for them to actually buy it.

251
00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:41.860
Now Imus explained something about the four types that we've kind of covered so far.

252
00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:47.190
We have the ads the explainers product and walk through videos and the first two.

253
00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:51.030
Generally speaking you're going to have higher production value right because it's customer facing.

254
00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:52.380
It's convincing people to buy.

255
00:15:52.390 --> 00:15:57.220
It's giving a new impression to someone who's never heard of your company and is trying to kind of shape

256
00:15:57.220 --> 00:15:58.600
the way they feel about you.

257
00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:04.750
There's also usually a lot of money kind of on the line right if you're going to do a $100000 ad campaign

258
00:16:04.810 --> 00:16:09.530
while in video ad makes it more successful than it's definitely worth it.

259
00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:12.140
And an explainer you put it on your home page.

260
00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:15.010
Well that could dramatically increase your conversions.

261
00:16:15.010 --> 00:16:21.140
Now with walk through those and product demos those can range in production value specially and walk

262
00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:26.980
through videos walk through videos are often just screencast where you just hear a voice and a screen.

263
00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:31.720
Now sometimes they'll actually show a person talking or they'll cut between someone talking and they

264
00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:34.940
go back to a screencast but that's actually less common.

265
00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:39.130
That's something to keep in mind if you don't have a lot of money or time to do a big production right

266
00:16:39.130 --> 00:16:39.670
now.

267
00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:44.340
Maybe you focus on the easier things like walk through or doing very basic product demos.

268
00:16:44.410 --> 00:16:49.240
Now the first three videos are focused on people who have not bought from you yet trying to convince

269
00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:53.780
them to do it and then walk through is generally speaking focused on the it.

270
00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:55.390
Now how do they get to use it.

271
00:16:55.390 --> 00:17:00.020
Well here's another one that's going to fit into that second camp and those are fake videos now.

272
00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:03.970
And I think he used to answer frequently asked questions and a lot of times will companies will do is

273
00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:09.520
make a few videos where they read off a question that comes from a customer and then make a video explaining

274
00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:09.750
it.

275
00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:14.870
These videos do not explain their entire product as a whole nor does it really jump into company culture

276
00:17:14.870 --> 00:17:19.060
or how they got started or the coolest features of the product.

277
00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:21.120
Generally speaking they just answer a question.

278
00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:26.020
Now these are great if you get the same questions over and over and over again it can really kind of

279
00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:29.300
put them to bed and give someone a link to this every single time they ask you.

280
00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:35.260
But also it does help with brand where people really like it when they see video explanations of questions

281
00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:40.360
they might run into Here's a random example lumber liquidators they sell hardwood flooring and while

282
00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:44.170
they also install it for you some customers just want to do it themselves.

283
00:17:44.170 --> 00:17:44.820
Fair enough.

284
00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:45.850
Destroy your knees.

285
00:17:45.850 --> 00:17:46.980
They don't really care.

286
00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:52.930
Well actually lumber liquidators does care well enough to produce a flooring one to one series of videos

287
00:17:53.230 --> 00:17:55.760
and one of them is called How to install laminate flooring.

288
00:17:55.780 --> 00:18:01.930
Now don't ask me to explain what the tap in joint method is but at the end of this 11 and a half minute

289
00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:05.330
video I probably could give you a decent shot and explanation.

290
00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:10.450
The point is if you're considering putting on a laminate flooring and you found Lumber Liquidators that

291
00:18:10.450 --> 00:18:13.520
might be a question you might have and you might be on the edge.

292
00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:17.740
While this helps you kind of get over the edge it can help people feel better about the decision they're

293
00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:19.760
about to make or have already made.

294
00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:24.280
And that's a key benefit of a video produced for the bottom end of your marketing funnel.

295
00:18:24.310 --> 00:18:30.350
As in the people at the very end of the process who have early bought it need to share or reengage or

296
00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:31.920
are really close to doing it.

297
00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:32.770
OK so there you go.

298
00:18:32.770 --> 00:18:37.970
We've gone over 6 different kinds of video each with a different focus and each with a different run

299
00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:40.150
time as we move forward in the video marketing section.

300
00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:41.730
Keep these videotapes in mind.

301
00:18:41.730 --> 00:18:46.360
Now you should be able to think up ideas for yourself and then help customers from the time they're

302
00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:52.490
just learning about you to the time when they become a IMR and beyond as you were listening Nurk down

303
00:18:52.490 --> 00:18:55.340
if any of these make sense for you and your business.

304
00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:56.570
A lot of them are easy to do.

305
00:18:56.570 --> 00:18:58.150
And some of them are a little bit harder.

306
00:18:58.190 --> 00:19:00.530
So with that being said I'll see you guys in the next hour.
