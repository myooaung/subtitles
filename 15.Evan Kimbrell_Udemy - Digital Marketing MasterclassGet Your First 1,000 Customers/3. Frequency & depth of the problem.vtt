00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.310
All right, we are back. In this lecture, we're talking
about two concepts for understanding and better
1

2
00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.540
conceptualizing what it is you are
solving for your potential customers.
2

3
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.010
The first is called frequency and
the second is called depth.
3

4
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:16.800
Now, hopefully, we have three pain points
listed out from the last lecture.
4

5
00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.590
If you don't have that, please go back and redo the last
lecture, and oh, try a little bit harder, why don't you?
5

6
00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.920
Even the dullest, shrivelest fruit of an idea
can still get some magic juice out of it
6

7
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.260
if you squeeze hard enough. Yes, it can be moldy, infested,
growing legs shaped like that alien face in The Scream,
7

8
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.530
if you squeeze hard enough. Yes, it can be moldy, infested,
growing legs shaped like that alien face in The Scream,
8

9
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.820
and you can still, with enough effort,
get something out of it.
9

10
00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.980
This lecture, by the way, brought to you by Tropicana
orange juice. Mmm, oranges, the only fruit with
10

11
00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.930
the nutritional value of a Snickers bar.
11

12
00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.690
Now, what I want you to do is take each of these
three and rate them based on the two dimensions of
12

13
00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.230
frequency and depth. Frequency just means, how
often does my target customer have this problem?
13

14
00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:04.200
Is it once a day, once a week, or once every five years?
The pain of budgeting your finances is probably
14

15
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:10.610
a daily or weekly pain, whereas the pain of moving apartments probably only happens every once,
15

16
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.720
I don't know, four or five years.
16

17
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.440
Now, the pain of choosing college
happens once or twice in your lifetime.
17

18
00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.580
So write down what you think the frequency is
for your specific group, not people in general,
18

19
00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.430
your group, your peoples.
19

20
00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.750
And then the next concept is depth, as in,
when your user has this pain or problem,
20

21
00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.470
how big of a deal is it?
21

22
00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.990
Is it a nuisance or something that
seriously disrupts their day?
22

23
00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.270
Not being able to keep track of your subscriptions,
probably not a huge pain, whereas let's say you have
23

24
00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.760
super AIDS or bacterial meningitis,
then, well, probably a deep pain.
24

25
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.170
Now, why do we do this exactly?
25

26
00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.120
Now, why do we do this exactly?
26

27
00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.290
Because when we go out there and start reaching out
to our target customers, we need to know both number
27

28
00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.600
one, which pain point is the best to target and highlight,
28

29
00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.440
and number two, we can then align our message
with the way they feel about their problem.
29

30
00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.690
Writing a headline that says, "Don't you just hate it
when you stay up all night because you keep having
30

31
00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.620
to decide where you're going to college?"
31

32
00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:15.840
doesn't particularly make any sense. If your pitch
doesn't make sense, then people aren't going to respond
32

33
00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.300
to it, unless of course you are pitching the producers
of Shark Tank, where they are almost always on
33

34
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.280
the hunt for the William Hung of
entrepreneurial elevator pitches.
34

35
00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.340
How do we use this information to
determine which is the best to go with?
35

36
00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.950
Well, you might just assume the one with the higher
frequency and higher depth is better, and that is
36

37
00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:41.990
true, but there's more nuance to it. Is medium depth
and medium frequency, for instance, worse than, say,
37

38
00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.780
huge depth, but no frequency?
38

39
00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.320
You're better off selling baby food than,
say, a baby name generator.
39

40
00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.070
No, actually, in this theoretical
circumstance, it is actually better.
40

41
00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.870
You generally want to look for something that is strong in
one of the categories and then at least average in the other.
41

42
00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:58.960
You generally want to look for something that is strong in
one of the categories and then at least average in the other.
42

43
00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.810
Also, generally speaking, problems that are felt strongly
generally trump frequent nagging problems.
43

44
00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:10.680
Of course, you can build a billion dollar business off
of both, but one is generally going to be a more
44

45
00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.800
ripe target for when you start
reaching out to your customers.
45

46
00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.030
All right, so take a second and think through
the pains you are hitting on with your product.
46

47
00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:24.180
Order them appropriately, and consider this your weaponized
toolbox, because we're going to use your problems
47

48
00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.960
against you.
48

49
00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.980
Anyway, moving on.
