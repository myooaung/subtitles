1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,330
Hey guys welcome back to the course.

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:06,630
So the last two lectures to be talked out the fundamentals of lighting and audio and both of those were

3
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:08,250
marathon lectures books.

4
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:10,910
Oh God bless you if you made it all the way through.

5
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:13,890
But it kind of just brain dumped everything I know about laying in audio.

6
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:19,920
So now where did the same thing that we're going to do it for the final and third a central part of

7
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:23,690
any video production and that is the most obvious part video.

8
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:28,610
Now we're going to go over the essential things you need to understand about video as well as cameras

9
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:34,030
camera equipment and then generally just recommendations on what to use to create marketing videos or

10
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:37,620
is let's just jump in because well there's more than enough to cover.

11
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:41,620
Now the first thing we should cover about video or some of the technical details.

12
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,320
I know right to the boring stuff but that's actually not that bad.

13
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,960
Now there are some key numbers you need to know.

14
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:51,710
The first one worth knowing is the concept of video resolution.

15
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:57,510
So if you for instance walk into a Best Buy or shop for a TV online you'll see flat screens and you'll

16
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:04,230
see curved screens and all different types of TVs listed with different resolutions resolution refers

17
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:09,110
to how much detail a screen can show or that a camera can record.

18
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:14,370
Now the standard as I'm speaking right now if you're watching is five years in the future I'm sorry

19
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:21,630
but Zander now is 10 ETP and that's kind of what we consider full HD or high definition.

20
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:28,830
Another 10 to 80 essentially refers to how many individual pixels of information are in each image.

21
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:34,110
It's kind of like if you're painting a canvas and you want to make a painting and instead of making

22
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:38,500
broad strokes you just put dots over and over and over again until you had an image.

23
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:40,410
It's kind of like an inkjet printer or something like that.

24
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:48,130
Well that's basically how TV screens and monitors show what you're viewing and how many dots there are.

25
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:52,440
Well that's the resolution 10 80 right now usually looks pretty crisp.

26
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:58,250
You're watching this and see what the P intensity P stands for is progressive scan.

27
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:04,140
And I don't think you necessarily need to know that but that's a technology that TVs used to scan all

28
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,220
of the pixel and then display them back to you.

29
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:12,270
Now of course there's 10 A.D. II which is not progressive scan and actually Tany II is considered lower

30
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:14,430
resolution and looks generally worse.

31
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:18,090
All you really need to know is that progressive scan is the improved way of creating the image and it

32
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:22,370
keeps the screen from flickering on like the older TVs used to do.

33
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:29,850
So the 10 18 resolution is just how many lines of pixels high you have well the width of whatever screen

34
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:35,390
you're viewing it on can actually be variable based on what you're viewing it on.

35
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:43,530
But what you can do is let's say you have a regular TV and it's one 9500 twenty pixels wide and then

36
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:44,220
it's tennents.

37
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,090
So it's 10 80 high.

38
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:50,880
Well if you do a little math what that basically means is that the ratio of the width to your height

39
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:53,270
is 16 to 9 ratio.

40
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:59,790
Now video peeps will call that an aspect ratio and that is a term you will run into if you're in video

41
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:02,590
and it's basically the shape of your video frame.

42
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:08,460
That aspect ratio could be different if you wanted something like a widescreen image or a wide angle

43
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:08,870
image.

44
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:14,250
Okay I know that's way too many numbers for talking about cameras and this isn't math class so why exactly

45
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:14,950
is this important.

46
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:21,120
Well knowing pixel aspect ratio will help you set up your video editing projects that also help you

47
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:28,500
be informed as to what equipment you need to buy and what standards you should be shooting for 8:44

48
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:28,950
ratio.

49
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:36,330
The one I just randomly mentioned is actually the standard ratio in 1920 by 10 JTP pixels is also the

50
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:40,920
standard in general if you for some reason wanted to shoot with multiple cameras you just need to make

51
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,850
sure that they're both shooting in the same resolution and the same aspect ratio.

52
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:47,650
Now of course there are other resolution types out there.

53
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:54,390
OK we have 720 P which is an older resolution only has 720 lines of pixels.

54
00:03:54,660 --> 00:04:00,690
And when HD TVs first came out that's what they were usually And they're usually in 720.

55
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,370
We didn't actually have 10:8 for a while.

56
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:06,460
And then it's 10 80 now you can only really at 720 if you buy like a cheap one.

57
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,900
But the newest thing on the market right now is what we call for k.

58
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:11,230
OK.

59
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:18,570
I Eric quoted that because for AK is not really new it's been out for at least two three four years

60
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:27,540
and soon it will be replaced by I think 8 K or something else but that is kind of the front tier currently.

61
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:32,820
Now why do we call the newest highest resolution for K and you guys might have noticed that like on

62
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:39,240
YouTube some videos you can actually select the quality setting and go to for k although most monitors

63
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,830
and most TVs now cannot display true for AK.

64
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:49,360
And if you're watching us in the future it's probably laughable anyway for k displays at 21:16.

65
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:54,090
P right now that's about double what we just said before which was 10 80.

66
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,200
So you might think to yourself Well if it's 21 60 and the old version was 10 80 you're watching 10:18

67
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:02,900
Rimmer then it's just double the resolution.

68
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:03,620
Right.

69
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:07,130
Well actually no for k is not twice the resolution.

70
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:11,540
It's four times the resolution four times as many pixels.

71
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:15,110
Now the reason why that is is because it's twice in height.

72
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:22,280
But because as you go up you also go over the same amount it's kind of like dragging and scaling an

73
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:27,170
image you're actually growing it for X not to x and you were the boy with four K's.

74
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:32,320
It's an enormous amount of detail and when you watch something in Torquay it is creepily clear.

75
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:34,650
Now what does this all mean for marketing videos.

76
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:39,680
You might wonder well the question is really less about what resolutions you can record or view videos

77
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,160
and and more about what your viewers and customers will use.

78
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:47,870
Now we talk about TVs but not laptops or phones which are probably where your audience will watch the

79
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:49,030
videos you're making.

80
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:57,430
Today's phones and laptops can play back video in HD at 720 pee or 10 ATP but not at 4 yet.

81
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,460
Unless of course you're a gamer and you have like a sick video card and monitor.

82
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:04,370
You probably don't have enough resolution on your screen to do it.

83
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:09,790
So then the question just becomes why do people shoot for k as opposed to 10 ATP.

84
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:14,150
Well and this gets a little bit complicated but bear with me here.

85
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:14,800
OK.

86
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,880
For carry is twice as many pixels right.

87
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:21,710
So if you take an image of my face you'll have twice as many dots to work with.

88
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:23,610
Now why is that a good thing.

89
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:28,360
Well when you edit your videos it's a lot easier when you have more information.

90
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:34,160
You can change the colors of things you can warp it you can move things around change the aspect ratio

91
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,410
because you have more on your plate.

92
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:40,430
It's less likely that you can end up with a blurry or degraded image.

93
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:45,680
For instance if you shot in any p and then he found out that oh well we really should have zoomed in

94
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:50,360
on this person's face when he talks and you try to do it and you might zoom in on my face.

95
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:55,880
Well there's not enough pixels then to make it look as crisp and clear as if you were looking at the

96
00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:00,320
normal and zoomed out view with four K..

97
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:05,480
It has so many pixels that you can zoom in for days and you won't even notice the difference.

98
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:08,520
So there's obviously benefits for editing for four.

99
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,150
OK.

100
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:14,780
But there's one other concept in this is totally extracurricular but it's worth understanding if you

101
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:20,090
want the clearest video you possibly can nowadays knowing that virtually no one can actually display

102
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:24,110
true for OK what you do is actually a process called downsampling.

103
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,290
Now what that means is you shoot for OK.

104
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:31,220
Actually right now I'm shooting for OK but you're watching it 10 ATP what I did is I took the four K

105
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:34,600
and then I use a computer program like Adobe media and.

106
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:36,430
There's a lot of the free ones that I'll do it.

107
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:42,470
And it took the four OK and then got rid of half or get rid of three quarters of the pixels and moved

108
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:43,820
it down to 10 a.p.

109
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:49,610
Now how exactly is that better than just shooting and a.p and this is actually something that for the

110
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:52,210
longest time did not actually understand until I finally did.

111
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:58,390
What happens when you down sample is that let's say that it's looking at a pixel of my eye right and.

112
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:01,240
It might have one pixel one four it's going to four pixels.

113
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:07,010
So when it goes from four to 10 ATP it's only to pick one of those four because it chooses one of the

114
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:11,960
four basic computer algorithm can choose which of those pixels is the best.

115
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:17,510
So really what's happening is it's going to construct 10 ATP again but it's going to pick all the best

116
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:25,060
clearest pixels that have you know the best color profile and are in general just higher quality.

117
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:25,950
Did that blow your mind.

118
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:27,320
Maybe I don't know.

119
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:31,460
All right hopefully you've got the gist of resolution aspect ratio and downsampling.

120
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:37,520
Today the frontier is for k but most people watch everything and 10 ATP currently laptops and phones

121
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:42,770
can only show 10 a.p but it is only a matter of time before they can show or show for K for k is 4 times

122
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:44,420
larger than 10 80.

123
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,040
Why.

124
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,820
Well it's just because of math.

125
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:50,440
Basically it's twice as tall but when you go twice as tall you also go twice as wide.

126
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,860
Therefore it's four times as large.

127
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:56,540
How do you get the crispest image possible while you shoot it for can you do a process called downsampling

128
00:08:56,540 --> 00:09:00,940
down to 10 ATP and that's how you get stuff that looks really really crisp.

129
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:02,460
But it's only Tany P.

130
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:09,020
I could probably link to a really short clip of me talking and for k and then you guys can go look at

131
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:09,590
it if you want.
