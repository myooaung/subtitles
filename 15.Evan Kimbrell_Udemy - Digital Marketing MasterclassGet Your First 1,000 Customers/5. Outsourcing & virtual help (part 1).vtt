1
00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.340
Hagar is welcome back to the course.

2
00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:02.850
OK.

3
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:08.130
We've covered quite a bit on the editing side and post-production side of things but you haven't noticed

4
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:14.490
each lecture is kind of masking the assumption that you yourself Mr. or Mrs. Numero Uno who will be

5
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.410
doing pretty much everything.

6
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.900
Now I know for a lot of you out there you might not have much of a budget or hey you're really just

7
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.250
new to this whole video marketing thing to begin with so maybe you're just dipping your toes in the

8
00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.480
water and not yet ready to invest and throw down the big bucks.

9
00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:29.790
Yeah.

10
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:31.050
And that's perfectly fine.

11
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.990
I personally suggest that in a perfect world.

12
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.290
Yes.

13
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:39.060
You yourself take the time to try to do as much as you can if you can learn a little bit about cameras

14
00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.760
a little bit about effective scripting and a little bit of editing.

15
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.520
Well then you're going to set yourself up to be in a much better position later on when you do go finally

16
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.150
find someone to do it for you as someone who understands the basics.

17
00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:55.950
You will find it way easier to communicate what you need and understand what the hell these people say

18
00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:56.560
back to you.

19
00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.880
I want to ask you what type of editing style you want it.

20
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.660
Well you'd never opened up premiere of Final Cut Pro.

21
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.450
What exactly would you tell them and would it all probably sound like jibberish kind of like when someone

22
00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.090
asked me to describe what I want in a logo.

23
00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.250
I have never designed anything in my life.

24
00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:18.130
And so my response usually amounts to basically caveman groans and made up words like cleanish or Wehby

25
00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:23.560
no good.

26
00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.660
Now here's someone who has the budget henceforth referred to as the bulge or has transition to a point

27
00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:37.310
where you want someone else to do your post-production Well then you have a decent set of options and

28
00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.470
this lecture and I think the next lecture we're going to cover how to break down video editing for a

29
00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:42.580
hiring standpoint.

30
00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.440
And then the next one we're going to tackle where to find these people and how to pick the right person.

31
00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:52.970
When I first started making online courses I painstakingly edited literally everything.

32
00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.990
Now I edit maybe two or three lectures a course and that's it.

33
00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.830
Try and see if you can actually Guess which one in each course is edited by me.

34
00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:02.810
I'll give you a clue.

35
00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.170
It's usually the one with explosions.

36
00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.780
OK so let's talk about contracting and outsourcing.

37
00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:12.650
Generally speaking when I say video editors we're actually talking about three different functions performed

38
00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:13.610
by one person.

39
00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.860
Number one it's called Timeline editing.

40
00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:21.650
Number two we have graphics editing and number three we have animations if you so decide to use them

41
00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:22.240
timeline.

42
00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.130
Editing is essentially what we did in the last lectures.

43
00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:30.710
This consists of taking raw footage or Rough Cuts removing bad takes bad angles and the like and putting

44
00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:33.800
everything in the right sequence with the right transitions.

45
00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:39.140
Now this process might also include some touching up if say your lighting was off or even audio mixing

46
00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.140
if you decided to say use more than one audio source.

47
00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.460
Mixing is exactly what it sounds like by the way they take audio sources and decide which one is best

48
00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:48.440
at what time.

49
00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.990
Now graphics editing on the other hand would be the process of adding things like floating text screencast

50
00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.470
images and even clips of videos.

51
00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:01.040
Now they might even do what are called interstitials which are basically images or screens that interrupt

52
00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.030
the main flow of the video for a short period of time.

53
00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:09.890
When I edit I put these in actually a lot I might interrupt a video screen that says something important

54
00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.780
or I might even freeze the screen and play the Jeopardy music if I for instance ask the viewer to think

55
00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.960
about something or go look for something.

56
00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.480
Right now

57
00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.170
yes I totally invented that joke because I'm that clever.

58
00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.170
Now the last thing I mentioned was animations.

59
00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:32.450
Now graphics are the basic elements that get added that aren't footage from your camera an image up

60
00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.470
throw a goofy screen up or throw up a goofy video or whatever.

61
00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:36.020
That's easy.

62
00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:41.090
Go find something that matches this topic and then use it animation on the other hand is almost always

63
00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:47.210
a custom process by which they take illustrations or images or who knows what and they add emotion to

64
00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.690
it.

65
00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:52.430
This stuff usually looks great and it usually gives off the feeling that this is a big production with

66
00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:53.920
fancy Mansi editors.

67
00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:56.680
You are basically Pixar.

68
00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:02.510
Most commonly you'll see this stuff in those little intro bits to video where you see an animated logo

69
00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.410
but you might see it throughout the video.

70
00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.250
Now the editing style of one of my favorite YouTube channels.

71
00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:08.280
Crash Course.

72
00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.130
I think we covered that already or it's coming up in the future.

73
00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.080
Well they constantly use animation of custom illustrations.

74
00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:20.480
Now think of that now those three things I just mentioned timeline editing graphics editing and animation

75
00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:24.230
are what is going to determine who you need to hire and how much you need to pay them.

76
00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:29.240
Someone who is only capable of doing timeline editing and you know there are surprisingly a large amount

77
00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.200
of them will generally be on the cheaper end of the spectrum.

78
00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:36.870
If they do timeline editing and graphics editing you're going to get more expensive.

79
00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.290
And this is the general rule.

80
00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.650
The more skills they have them and the more they can do for you well then the more they're going to

81
00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:43.190
cost.

82
00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:48.560
If they can do all three of those things timeline graphics and animations well then they're going to

83
00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:49.880
be pretty pretty pricey.

84
00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:55.160
Generally speaking it's also the case that you'll find editors out there that only do one of these three.

85
00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:00.950
And in fact in the case of timeline editing an animation while this is actually pretty common in fact

86
00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:06.170
it's actually kind of rare to find someone who can do animation and also focus on the other types of

87
00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.840
editing.

88
00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:12.110
Usually animators specialized in animation and often they use entirely different softwares like Adobe

89
00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:16.070
After Effects which you cannot really timeline at in if that's the case.

90
00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:20.840
Well you might have to look for multiple people but don't really forget this is actually pretty normal.

91
00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:26.090
Sometimes you have a timeline editor who then passes the video off to a graphics person who then passes

92
00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:27.330
it off to an animator.

93
00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.870
Now the game with outsourcing video is this.

94
00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:34.100
You want to get the person that has all the skills you need and nothing more.

95
00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:36.730
Now the analogy I like to think of is like running a hotel.

96
00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:41.480
Yes a hotel stay with me here now when you book hotel you'll notice the prices fluctuate all over the

97
00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:44.330
place and sometimes it doesn't really even make that much sense.

98
00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:48.630
Why is a Hyatt more expensive than a holiday and which is more expensive than a best western.

99
00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:52.970
Well because the Hyatt has more middies and the price shows that they have a hot tub.

100
00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:53.900
You pay for that.

101
00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:54.540
They have a pool.

102
00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:56.100
You'll pay for that restaurant.

103
00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:00.310
And in fact even if you don't eat there you do pay for the access to that restaurant.

104
00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:05.060
So if you don't plan to eat and swim at your hotel why are you booking a Hyatt booked the hotel that

105
00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:06.960
only has the things they'll actually use.

106
00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:12.020
The next time you think about hiring an editor just think I need a best western because it's got a bed

107
00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:18.240
a door and a light bulb and you'll never be confused because that makes complete sense even out of context.

108
00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:20.830
So decide up front what you need do you want.

109
00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:21.590
Animation.

110
00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:22.060
No.

111
00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:25.450
Then don't hire someone who has the capability of doing animation.

112
00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:30.290
Do you need complex graphics editing or just basic text on a screen if you need the basics and don't

113
00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:33.170
hire the guy who can do the complex stuff if you know what you want.

114
00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:35.540
That will make the process simpler and cheaper.

115
00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:40.730
The second thing you need to decide up front is this how much time do you want to spend managing this

116
00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:41.540
person.

117
00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:46.940
Maybe you're the person who has lots of free time and loves to make documents on what you need and can

118
00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:49.940
review every minute of video they possibly could pump out.

119
00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:52.940
OK well that's good to know although I think you're probably crazy.

120
00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:58.370
Maybe you're more like me and you don't have the time to do that so you want someone who can get more

121
00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:59.000
from last.

122
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.950
With regard to instruction that specific type of person you can be more confident that they know what

123
00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:07.220
you want so you don't really need to micro-manage them as much.

124
00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:08.540
Now the rule here is very simple.

125
00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:13.100
The more communication and management you are willing to give them the cheaper they will be.

126
00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:15.130
There are video editors all over the world.

127
00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:20.120
I can hire someone in San Francisco or someone in Mombasa Kenya the person in San Francisco is going

128
00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:23.260
to be able to run on their own without much from me.

129
00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:28.100
They're probably going to be more independent but the person in Kenya will not just figure it out on

130
00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:28.760
their own.

131
00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:33.740
Their standard of editing and their standard of what good qualifies as it's just different and you'll

132
00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:36.960
have to make up the gap with more direction and more hand-holding.

133
00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:40.600
You guys are in my outsourcing courses and you knew this tenant pretty well.

134
00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:42.200
You want to get the best bang for your buck.

135
00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:45.740
Then you're just going to have to spend more time on it personally.

136
00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:48.320
So ask yourself how much time do I have to spend on this.

137
00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:53.570
Maybe you're making an educational series you published two videos a week and oh you're also the CEO

138
00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:54.810
of everything else.

139
00:07:54.980 --> 00:08:00.590
Maybe you want someone who's a little hands off but maybe let's say you're making a one off promo and

140
00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:05.350
your product isn't live yet so you have some time to make sure you get this one right now.

141
00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:09.650
Here are some prices that you can use as a rough rough guide to what you'll end up paying for those

142
00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:14.500
two spectrums of editors capability and then the requirement of Management.

143
00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:19.460
Please do not quote me on this as there are a million and one exceptions and markets constantly change

144
00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:24.840
someone who does timeline editing only and needs a lot of hand-holding will be the cheapest.

145
00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:29.890
If you are okay working with someone out of your country you can get some of those $4 an hour.

146
00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:32.930
You want to work with an American or European film student.

147
00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:36.300
You can get them as cheap as 10 to $15 an hour.

148
00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:41.840
Now this is someone who speaks your language and probably doesnt need as much hand-holding now and attend

149
00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:47.250
to $15 range $10 to probably be someone who gets a lot of instruction and then the 15 percent will be

150
00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:49.420
people that are more OK on their own.

151
00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:55.290
That's usually the range if you want someone to do your timeline editing and your graphics editing out

152
00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:55.950
of country.

153
00:08:55.950 --> 00:09:02.440
You could pay as low as $8 an hour to $20 an hour in an expensive country with less hand-holding.

154
00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:05.610
Well expect to pay more in the range of 15 to 30 dollars an hour.

155
00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:10.530
Now if you want someone who could do all three timeline editing graphics animation and custom work.

156
00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:16.020
I usually see the prices like this while out of the country with more management also known as it probably

157
00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:18.000
don't speak the same language perfectly.

158
00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:24.180
You might get them at man probably $20 an hour on the very low end but it could easily go all the way

159
00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:30.670
up to $50 an hour in an expensive country with less management and all three of those skills while youd

160
00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:33.710
expect to pay at an absolute minimum thirty five dollars an hour.

161
00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:36.900
You could easily pay well over 70 an hour.

162
00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:39.150
So there are two ways of planning your strategy.

163
00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:43.200
One is to pick where you fall into regards decide what level editing you need.

164
00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:48.420
Do you just need a timeline editor or do you need graphics and potentially do any custom animation.

165
00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:52.620
The second thing is how much time and management you're willing to give lots of free time and patience

166
00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:54.240
or limited free time.

167
00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:57.530
And you know you want more of a free range Ed..

168
00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:01.980
Now the other way of course of doing this is just to decide what your budget is and then just work backwards.

169
00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:06.900
If you know you can only spend $30 an hour for instance well that means you could work with an editor

170
00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:11.340
that does all three types of editing but is out of your country and is going to need more communication

171
00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:12.170
and instruction.

172
00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:17.670
Or you could work with a local more independent editor that might not have the same polished set of

173
00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:18.230
skills.

174
00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:19.320
Now that's two ways of doing it.

175
00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:22.740
Take a moment and ask yourself where you fall and then let's move on to the next lecture.

176
00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:25.630
We'll talk about where to find these magical editors.

177
00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:26.140
See that.
