Hey guys, welcome back. In this lecture,
1

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:07,260
we're going to follow up on the previous lecture,
where we identified how to get a list of topic based
2

3
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:13,030
forums for us to take advantage of and get in
touch with potential first 10 type customers.
3

4
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:14,470
Now that we have the forums listed out,
4

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,640
we need to reach out to the people that are in them,
5

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,560
and in this lecture we're going to cover two ways
of doing so that work at this stage of your business
6

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:28,320
development. There are, of course, other ways of taking
advantage of forums, but those are better suited
7

8
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,100
later when you have more time and
resources to dedicate to the effort.
8

9
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:36,190
The first strategy I suggest is,
number one, direct messaging them.
9

10
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:42,030
Now, the problem with online forums is that, well, people can
see what you're typing. Now, that's a good and a bad thing.
10

11
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:43,850
Now, the problem with online forums is that, well, people can
see what you're typing. Now, that's a good and a bad thing.
11

12
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:49,890
Good, because potentially more people will see it,
but bad, because you could find yourself up against
12

13
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:55,710
an angry mob of users hellbent on protecting
the community from corporate shills.
13

14
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:59,010
This obviously varies depending
on the culture of the forum,
14

15
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,240
and don't worry, we'll cover Reddit
in the next couple of lectures.
15

16
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:04,600
Oh, the notorious and mercurial Reddit.
16

17
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:05,030
Oh, the notorious and mercurial Reddit.
17

18
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:08,460
Now, does every forum have direct message capabilities?
18

19
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:13,060
No, and that's why covering two different
ways is the way that we're going to do this.
19

20
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:18,180
Now, if it does have the ability to direct message, well, then
it would be relatively obvious to understand how this works.
20

21
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,020
Now, if it does have the ability to direct message, well, then
it would be relatively obvious to understand how this works.
21

22
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:24,280
First, find a thread that might be started
around your product area or industry topic.
22

23
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:26,880
There are really two different ways of finding this.
23

24
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:30,350
One is you can use that embedded
search function in the forum itself,
24

25
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:36,360
virtually all forums have this, and usually it'll have
an advanced option, and you can select whether
25

26
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,790
you only want to search things
like thread topics or full posts.
26

27
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:41,000
Really up to you.
27

28
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:46,290
Generally, full posts will get you more to look at, but that
also means you have more to actually weed through.
28

29
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:46,840
Generally, full posts will get you more to look at, but that
also means you have more to actually weed through.
29

30
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,240
The second way you can do this, and this one is actually
my favorite, is to instead use the world's best
30

31
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,270
search engine, Google, to search through that forum.
31

32
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:56,230
Now, how do you do it exactly?
32

33
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:57,270
It's actually pretty simple.
33

34
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:04,360
Go to Google and type "site:" and then immediately
following that, no spaces, put the actual URL of the forum.
34

35
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:07,100
Go to Google and type "site:" and then immediately
following that, no spaces, put the actual URL of the forum.
35

36
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:12,450
So if the thread you're looking at is like
"thisgreatforum.com/thread=blahblahblah",
36

37
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:16,080
then you just have to put "thisgreatforum.com."
37

38
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:22,230
If you only want to search a subdirectory, such as the
case where maybe you're using a forum where
38

39
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:29,130
only a subsection is relevant to you, then just type in
the subdirectory, "thisgreatforum.com/nameofsub."
39

40
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:30,530
only a subsection is relevant to you, then just type in
the subdirectory, "thisgreatforum.com/nameofsub."
40

41
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:35,070
The thing is that these embedded search engines
on these forums are usually just god awful,
41

42
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:42,120
which is really mind boggling, because it theoretically
has access to all of the pages on its site, so 
42

43
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,940
shouldn't it have the biggest advantage?
43

44
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:44,340
I don't know.
44

45
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:45,620
I'd suggest you don't think about it.
45

46
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:51,000
It's kind of like having a stranger come into your house and find
your keys well before you even remember what room they're in.
46

47
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,480
It's kind of like having a stranger come into your house and find
your keys well before you even remember what room they're in.
47

48
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:56,250
Yes, Google came into your house and found you some keys.
48

49
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,870
Memorize that. Now, when you're searching,
49

50
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:02,700
don't forget to try key phrases that we
explored in the complainy people section.
50

51
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:07,080
Oftentimes, you'll have people say similar
things in these forums themselves.
51

52
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:12,210
Once you do some searching, you can narrow down on
what people are talking about, who is talking, and which
52

53
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:16,680
of the people in the conversation are potentially
someone with enough displayed interest that it might
53

54
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,290
be worth reaching out to them.
54

55
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:24,300
When you grab a handful of users, say, 5-10 or
10-20, depending on the quality, and you get ready
55

56
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:27,130
to write a message, what do you say?
56

57
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:34,230
Well, there are a million different ways to do this, but
I'll give you three different types of messages that
57

58
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:36,140
I have personally seen work best.
58

59
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:42,750
The best message you can send by far is going to
be based off something they specifically said in the
59

60
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:46,940
thread, followed by a reason for
why you are messaging them.
60

61
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:52,020
If they are, let's say, complaining about something,
tell them you think you can solve that problem that
61

62
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:53,190
they're complaining about.
62

63
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:56,400
If they don't know how to do
something, try explaining it to them.
63

64
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:02,340
Always round it off by telling them why you didn't post
in the general thread, because remember, it's kind
64

65
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,340
of weird that you didn't do it.
65

66
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:09,420
You can make something up or just explain that, you know,
you only wanted to message them and the thread
66

67
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,160
is so long anyway, you might not see it, blah blah blah.
67

68
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:11,780
is so long anyway, you might not see it, blah blah blah.
68

69
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:16,690
So that is type one, respond to something
they said in the thread that you found them.
69

70
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:19,930
The second type I've seen work
pretty well is the feedback angle.
70

71
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:24,650
Now, you just message them with something
simple like "I saw you said such and such.
71

72
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:30,200
I'm working on something that is in that space,
I'm trying to figure out if people really want this.
72

73
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:30,990
What do you think?"
73

74
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:34,630
Or another way of doing this is to ask
"Can you give me your honest feedback?"
74

75
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:38,150
The key here though to make
this actually work is vulnerability.
75

76
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,500
People really don't like getting approached by strangers, 
and specifically some of the more seasoned
76

77
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:49,670
users are actually hyper weary of people pitching
them and trying to actually sell them something.
77

78
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,690
So the way that you kind of get around that possibility
and diffuse the inherent tension is by being
78

79
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:59,340
as open and as vulnerable as you can.
Tell them the truth of where you are.
79

80
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:02,020
Tell them what you really think about your business.
80

81
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:03,070
Open yourself up.
81

82
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:08,020
It is much, much harder to shoot someone down
when they open themselves up to you like that.
82

83
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:12,310
And, worst case scenario, hey,
you've got some brutal advice.
83

84
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:13,180
So type one, continue the conversation
you saw them having, add some value,
84

85
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:16,600
So type one, continue the conversation
you saw them having, add some value,
85

86
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,700
point something out,
86

87
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:25,000
explain something, and then include your products
somewhere in the first message, or in the second one, or
87

88
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,090
just somewhere in there, as long as it's relevant.
88

89
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:30,310
Type two, just ask them as open as possible for feedback.
89

90
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:32,910
The point is it gets them on your
website, and if they're interested,
90

91
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,860
well, then there's a good chance they'll buy.
91

92
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:38,140
As always, don't get lazy and start
copying and pasting your message.
92

93
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:41,020
People can smell that really from like a mile away.
93

94
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:48,040
And if you plan on posting in here later on, people will
dogpile on you if they think that your spam messaging
94

95
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:49,340
people on the side.
95

96
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:54,760
Direct messaging is the best way to keep yourself 
out of the fire and establish a direct conversation.
96

97
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:59,710
It might be a little tedious, but it will get you some
people looking at your stuff, and if you do it enough
97

98
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:04,060
times, people will start to buy or sign up,
whatever it is that you want.
98

99
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:09,040
Now, the second way of using this type of forum,
and 90% of the time you can actually do this,
99

100
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:11,320
is to just reply in the thread.
100

101
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:16,100
This is my second suggestion because its
quite a bit harder to pull off effectively.
101

102
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,810
However, if you do it right, you only need
to do it once or twice to get your 10.
102

103
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:20,130
Why?
103

104
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:24,010
Because not just one person sees it,
but many people could potentially see it.
104

105
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:25,780
Why exactly is this harder?
105

106
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:31,010
Well, because in general it's harder to please
a crowd than to please one person.
106

107
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:34,180
So you really have to tiptoe around
what you're going to say.
107

108
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:38,340
So read through the entire thread and
make sure you're not missing anything.
108

109
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:43,060
Don't get lazy, because if you repeat something someone else
has already brought up, you're going to get burned or ignored.
109

110
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:45,230
Don't get lazy, because if you repeat something someone else
has already brought up, you're going to get burned or ignored.
110

111
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:48,630
The number one thing that you want
to keep in mind here is value.
111

112
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:55,080
Am I adding value to this conversation or am I just
broadcasting something no one really cares about?
112

113
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:01,480
You can add value by sharing your experiences,
seconding opinions, sharing a resource you found, maybe
113

114
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:07,180
even doing some research to back up a comment
another person made, or just by asking a question.
114

115
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:12,240
Past that, there are three quick and dirty ways of
getting your product links in the actual thread post.
115

116
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:13,960
Number one, suggest it.
116

117
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:19,660
Someone mentions doing something and you suggest that
this product would make some aspect of their life better.
117

118
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:20,170
Someone mentions doing something and you suggest that
this product would make some aspect of their life better.
118

119
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:26,590
The key here is to not come off like you're trying to
convince them. Just say something like "Have you
119

120
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:33,450
tried this?" Or one thing I like to do is include
it with other similar or substitute products.
120

121
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:40,060
It's actually a lot harder to get called a shill when
you're just presenting options, and one of those
121

122
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,830
options happens to be yours.
122

123
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:45,340
You can, of course, present your option
as the best or the one in front.
123

124
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:50,720
I personally like to post and then insult
my own product, because, curve ball,
124

125
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:52,030
no one sees that coming.

126
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:56,080
The second way you can fit your product
into your post is to put a link in your footer.
126

127
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:02,050
Now, people read your comment, then they see this 
little bio sentence at the bottom, and then they can
127

128
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:03,430
check out what you're doing.
128

129
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:04,660
It's pretty simple.
129

130
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:08,380
Most forums allow it and most people 
will put something at the bottom.
130

131
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,350
Again, just make sure you're not
trying to convince them to go,
131

132
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:14,140
where you're saying like "It's 20% off at this website."
132

133
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,120
Just put it there.
133

134
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:20,520
This is what I work on. And last, but not least, you can
openly state that you own the product that you're
134

135
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:23,020
inserting in and just kind of own it.
135

136
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:26,890
You could say something like "I'm sorry,
but shameless plug, I made this."
136

137
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:27,850
You could say something like "I'm sorry,
but shameless plug, I made this."
137

138
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:30,740
People generally have an okay reaction to that.
138

139
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:36,540
After that though, it's best to then justify why you're
not just inserting it randomly into a conversation.
139

140
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:39,540
Again, relevancy is always going to be the key here.
140

141
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:41,850
OK, so now you're ready to go out and do this one.
141

142
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:47,520
Make your list of topic forums, do the digging to see
which ones you can use and are worth tackling.
142

143
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:48,660
If you can't find any,
143

144
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:50,500
well, you're just not trying hard enough.
144

145
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:56,860
Then do some lurking and gather some threads that
you think are on your topic or gather some individuals
145

146
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:00,610
you have seen that have displayed
interest in your category.
146

147
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:03,550
Direct message them if you can, and if not, try your luck
147

148
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:09,190
posting and participating in the forum, with of course
the link being slipped somewhere into the discussion
148

149
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:10,450
or into the footer.
149

150
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,750
Okay, children, go run free and
ruin forums for everyone for eternity.
150

151
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:15,620
See you next lecture.
