00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:01.520
All guys welcome back.

2
00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:05.780
So we discussed white papers and what those are in our last lecture.

3
00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:10.820
Now let's discuss how to make one book before we create anything we need to establish a few things up

4
00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:11.370
front.

5
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.930
Number one what's our white paper topic going to be about what are we going to write about.

6
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:22.700
It should be a specific topic or a problem that we specifically can provide insight or a solution for.

7
00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:29.370
And since this is a white paper we should have some evidence of some kind perhaps some data or independent

8
00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:34.680
or unique research we've done that we can present to reinforce whatever argument we're trying to make.

9
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.820
Number two we need to figure out is who is the audience we're specifically targeting with this white

10
00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:39.420
paper.

11
00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.130
Now you might be trying to get new customers people who obviously haven't heard of you yet but would

12
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:46.180
have an interest in your products or services.

13
00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:52.020
This also could be your current customers as well helping to reinforce the decision they made to buy

14
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.410
your product or service or to get them to upscale or to move to a bigger product or whatever.

15
00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.770
Either way it was you know who the audience is will better help you prepare for writing the material

16
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:04.690
you want to write it for a specific group of people.

17
00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:11.010
Generally speaking you can make a wide ranging white papers you see wide ranging white papers on top

18
00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.380
marketing tactics of 2017 and they're huge.

19
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.370
But those are not nearly as effective because who who exactly is going to download that.

20
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.150
It's too wide of a group.

21
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.070
You might get a lot of tuna in your net with that one you might catch a lot of people that are not actually

22
00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.790
in your target markets kind of always.

23
00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.380
The third thing you need to ask yourself is What are we trying to accomplish by creating this white

24
00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.800
paper.

25
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.360
Most likely we're trying to get leads so if we put this document on a form where they have to enter

26
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.210
information makes a lot of sense.

27
00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.720
But at the same time are trying to prove some things right want to prove that we know we're talking

28
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.010
about that we're an expert on whatever this topic is and then if readers want to know more connecting

29
00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.050
with us would be in their best interest.

30
00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.560
Once you answer those questions well start writing.

31
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.000
So let's consider a scenario here.

32
00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:57.860
Let's say I wanted to write a white paper to help people design better mobile apps.

33
00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:58.470
It's been done.

34
00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.120
But you could certainly make something that's valuable here perhaps on a mobile app developer myself

35
00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.770
and my business is consulting with businesses to create an app for them whatever.

36
00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.190
So what better way to prove I know what I'm talking about than creating a white paper outlining some

37
00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.120
of the expertise I have to offer.

38
00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.210
Usually it's a good thing.

39
00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.600
The first thing to do is come up with a great title.

40
00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.320
So consider who your audience is and a common problem they deal with.

41
00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.860
You probably need to identify the problem quickly to make it interesting and relevant and build up to

42
00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.760
a solution which you offer through research and data.

43
00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.450
But your title should really sum it all up quickly and concisely.

44
00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:36.840
But just because your white paper might provide data and be more academic in tone it doesn't mean you

45
00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.090
should force an academic sounding title onto it doesn't have to be written like a medical journal.

46
00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.410
Think about it Would you rather read a white paper called the detrimental effects of current design

47
00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.110
trends on mobile app adoption and effectiveness.

48
00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.020
I almost fell asleep or 10 easy ways to design a better app.

49
00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:58.620
Your title should be clear and descriptive but also it's got to be interesting to your audience and

50
00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.230
the value can't be just buried somewhere in there.

51
00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.020
That's not something that they have to snuggle up by the fire with.

52
00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.910
But also you shouldn't put them to sleep when they read it.

53
00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.050
OK so once you just pick that title then you just need to get into writing it.

54
00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:15.930
Now most white papers have a similar structure so follow along here and you'll probably be in good shape.

55
00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.050
So the first thing you want to do is you only just create an outline.

56
00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.890
Do yourself a favor and just outline the white paper will save you time as you put it all together and

57
00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.520
keep you from forgetting anything.

58
00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:29.060
Now a classic white paper outline includes the sections you generally have an introduction.

59
00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.170
Then you have a background background on the problem.

60
00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:37.170
Background on the solution or background on who you are and it's a little sales.

61
00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.130
Then what you want to do is a statement of the problem.

62
00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:45.720
Talk about how bad it is what we've experienced and maybe why then you will generally want to cover

63
00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.460
your solution and then your conclusion.

64
00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.200
Now each section is important to prove your argument you're making in the white paper.

65
00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.310
Let's look at the introduction.

66
00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:58.030
Well like any written piece you're going to need to immediately get the attention of your audience.

67
00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:01.260
What relevant problem are you going to address in this white paper.

68
00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.360
Why should the reader care.

69
00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.370
Why should they spend all their time reading the next 20 pages.

70
00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.460
And what do you propose as a solution.

71
00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:13.200
You shouldn't go into great detail here since this is obviously just an intro but it needs to be interesting

72
00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.340
and compelling enough so people will want to keep reading and they know the stakes of what they're about

73
00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:18.030
to learn.

74
00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.500
Your introduction might run down the current problems with let's say ride sharing apps including the

75
00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.560
major issues that are affecting people using apps or recommending than others.

76
00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.960
And you've got some industry data let's say showing satisfaction is down.

77
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.100
So you have a proposal which you state quickly and clearly here and you tell the reader what to expect

78
00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:41.300
as they read on because there are benefits to following your advice including increased user satisfaction

79
00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.230
and let's say improved word of mouth.

80
00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:47.590
Everything here is included for your audience and it should compel them to read on.

81
00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:51.900
So provide some background give your reader the lay of the land what's happening in the world right

82
00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.530
now what's happening in their specific industry.

83
00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:59.080
So this is where you dig in with a recap of some current events and trends.

84
00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:02.060
Maybe gyms are facing a downturn right now.

85
00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:05.580
New registrations are down x percent in the last X years.

86
00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:11.050
For example if your readers are gym owners well they'll recognize this problem or at least you can expose

87
00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.390
the problem to them and then educate them.

88
00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:15.240
The next section is stating the problem.

89
00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:17.950
So what problem do you plan on solving with this white paper.

90
00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:19.480
Make sure you state it very clearly.

91
00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:24.550
This means describing the problem explaining who it's affecting right now and why it will be a good

92
00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:25.870
thing to solve it.

93
00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:29.080
Do you have data or research to prove that there's a problem.

94
00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:30.620
Well this is the place you want to share it.

95
00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:36.130
For addressing that same problem let's say with gym memberships what would explain why there's a downturn.

96
00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:41.320
Maybe people are just working out more at home maybe they're using free streaming services like YouTube

97
00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:45.130
or paid ones they already have like Netflix to consume their workout programs.

98
00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:52.440
Who knows maybe there is one or two other major issues causing brick and mortar gym locations the struggle.

99
00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:55.330
Outline them here with evidence and with some data.

100
00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.400
Make the problem real and relevant to your reader.

101
00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:01.900
This affects them well they'll be compelled to know how to fix it if they don't then they're probably

102
00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:02.940
not your target market.

103
00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:03.820
And here's why.

104
00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:09.550
These first few items are especially important if you write up a solid intro and problem statement.

105
00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:14.830
Both things will directly help you write copy for your landing page for this White Paper your landing

106
00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:20.920
page needs to clearly state what the white papers about what it will cover who its for and why they

107
00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:21.550
should care.

108
00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:27.290
So once you create those pieces in your outline you'll be ahead of the game by a mile.

109
00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:31.510
So now that you've stated the problem really gotten in there and rubbed it in.

110
00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:33.400
Now you want to outline your solution.

111
00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:37.380
So break down your solution for the reader into pieces.

112
00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:43.690
What exactly do you propose what steps do they need to take to reverse this negative trend you've identified.

113
00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:46.980
Are these steps people can actually follow.

114
00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:48.250
Explain it fully.

115
00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:50.240
Is there data to back up your proposal.

116
00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:51.470
Try to share that as well.

117
00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:56.770
And are there some customer success stories or other examples that show this solution really works.

118
00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:59.260
Those will be really effective to prove your point.

119
00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:03.710
So how are we going to directly counteract the problem we've laid out.

120
00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:08.710
Let's say the problem we're trying to solve for app developers is how to speed up the development process

121
00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:14.080
so your solution is a set of tactics to help developers more easily repurposed code from apps that are

122
00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:15.030
already built.

123
00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:17.750
In fact you've got let's say five things they can do.

124
00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:23.800
So outline those solutions and make sure each one is clearly communicated with steps to follow examples

125
00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:27.280
to show how it works and data if it helps your case as well.

126
00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:32.430
Evidence of someone using your solution and then finding success also would be perfect right about here.

127
00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:37.830
But as far as your conclusions just pretty much just some everything up tie up the problem solution

128
00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:41.740
a neat little bow and remind the reader what benefits will see if they follow your advice.

129
00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:45.850
Also a good place where you can predict the future if you think it's going to get worse or we don't

130
00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:46.920
know what's going to happen.

131
00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:50.830
You've created the pieces already in this outline so remind them of the current state of things.

132
00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:56.470
Tell them that problem give them the solution and sell this solution more time by stating the benefits

133
00:07:56.470 --> 00:07:57.790
of the following plan.

134
00:07:57.790 --> 00:08:02.530
So once the written part is taken care of give your white paper a decently looking design.

135
00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:07.240
It's a white paper it's all academic doesn't need to look fantastic but at the same time nobody wants

136
00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:09.630
to look at a plain sheet of paper.

137
00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:11.760
When you're designing and keep these ideas in mind.

138
00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:18.040
Your end product is going to be a PTF not a page on line so you need to figure out what to use to write

139
00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:18.910
it and design it.

140
00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:24.910
Apps like you know word Indesign or even google docs do have options for this.

141
00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:27.130
However templates can help quite a bit.

142
00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:32.260
There's a toolset called Karrada that you can use and they have ones for Microsoft Word.

143
00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:37.970
Ironically they make you complete a form in order to get the templates they have bought.

144
00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:39.140
Are decent again.

145
00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:43.960
Also I like to harp on this one but Kanva use Kanva a lot for this type of stuff although formatting

146
00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:46.880
text on their site is a little tricky.

147
00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:51.560
Can be a bit of a pain past that I'd also say just check out InDesign.

148
00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:56.800
I think it's Adobe but it's really made for print design and so they just have tons and tons of templates

149
00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:59.260
you can use if you really want to buy a template.

150
00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:05.410
Pretty sure there are sites like in Vado market and like theme forest and stuff like that that actually

151
00:09:05.410 --> 00:09:10.750
sell written out collateral themes that you can convert for a white paper Passat.

152
00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:14.090
Always remember to include your company name and logo as part of that design.

153
00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:15.900
Here is a very simple example.

154
00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:18.600
Single sign on for mobile apps from koni.

155
00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:23.500
OK right on the first page you see their logo so it's pretty easy to know who this is from.

156
00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:29.320
Next step I'd say is use a simple color scheme that plays off any colors in your logo or product like

157
00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:34.870
if you have a red and white logo and the pages will obviously be white because it's white paper but

158
00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:40.150
your headers and other design elements could then be the alternate color of red or a neutral color like

159
00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:45.100
gray and next up well you probably need to create some graphs or pie charts or something right.

160
00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:50.160
Well if you have data in Excel you can create something in there using those built in graph tools.

161
00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:54.730
Everybody will recognize those and if they recognize it it means it looks like you didn't put a lot

162
00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:59.320
of effort into it so you can also plot out some better looking graphs on a site called plot.

163
00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:01.560
Lee It's like plot L Y.

164
00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:07.140
All you really have to do is just provide the data in a C S V file or a tabbed format which is actually

165
00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:10.310
pretty easy in Excel you just save it you save as.

166
00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:16.320
Don't say it as an Excel file save it as a CXXVI or you can actually just copy and paste it from a spreadsheet

167
00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:17.050
into the Web site.

168
00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:21.930
So this plot the graph on the comic book movies released per year looks pretty nice and yet terrifying

169
00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:22.880
at the same time.

170
00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:27.090
So once you've got a well-designed awesomely written white paper it's time to post it and promote it

171
00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:31.620
using different channels including social media to spread the word about this new paper and drive people

172
00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:35.760
to the landing page where they can download it include some of the great copy you wrote for your white

173
00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:36.960
paper on the landing page.

174
00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:41.250
Your introduction would make for good material as to why the problem you're stating is valid and relevant

175
00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:45.250
and use bullets to quickly outline what readers will get when they download the paper.

176
00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:49.320
Don't be too redundant because a veteran reads the tire landing page and then they read the first few

177
00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:51.580
pages of your white paper and the like oh wow.

178
00:10:51.810 --> 00:10:53.140
Same exact thing.

179
00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:54.510
You'll lose a lot of people.

180
00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:59.010
Here's an example 37 Signals It's a company that makes base camp.

181
00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:03.840
They outlined all of these pieces nicely written on a white paper download page.

182
00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:07.770
They even state the questions people ask why should I care about contingency design.

183
00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:11.910
What will I learn from this White Paper and who should read this white paper.

184
00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:16.200
Answer those questions right off the bat and the right audience will give your white paper a look.

185
00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:16.780
All right.

186
00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:17.800
Well there you go.

187
00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:20.040
What white papers should you consider writing.

188
00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:24.890
Give it some thought and make a plan for creating some they can help you get leads just like other formats.

189
00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:29.990
I'll be discussing in the lectures to come to remember that these are magnets which are basically just

190
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.720
things that you then have to go out and promote to get people to come to the page.

191
00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:35.690
Remember it is always two parts to this.

192
00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:38.820
You have to offer something and you have to attract their attention.

193
00:11:38.830 --> 00:11:41.130
The only thing is that the lead Magnetar lead page.

194
00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:42.360
It's just a lot easier.

195
00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:47.280
It's a lot easier to proliferate this out into the wild and you can use this in combination of the other

196
00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:52.030
sections of the courts like SC m running running ads it's perfect for running ads.

197
00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:55.980
Also MCO a lot of times if you Google something you'll find a lead magnet.

198
00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:57.390
All right guys I'll see you in the next lecture.
