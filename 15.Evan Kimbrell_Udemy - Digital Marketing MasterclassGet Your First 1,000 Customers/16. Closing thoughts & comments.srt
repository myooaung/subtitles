1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:00,740
OK.

2
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:01,970
Good to see you back.

3
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:04,050
Let's wrap up this s.c.s section now.

4
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:09,210
Some final thoughts the first being you know maybe you should just hire someone to do all this stuff

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:09,840
for you.

6
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,350
And I'm being completely serious.

7
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:12,950
Now do you watch all these lectures.

8
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,790
You should know how intensive some of the best practices can be specially if you need to review individual

9
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:21,930
pages and make code changes or regularly review Google Analytics.

10
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:26,960
It is a lot of work especially for sites that publish a lot of stuff and want to rank for a lot of things.

11
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:29,670
But as a way to grow your audience SCEA works.

12
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:33,660
So you need to decide where you put in the work yourself or will you get someone to help you.

13
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,400
Now is this something you want to oversee.

14
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,020
Go for it.

15
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:40,380
Well this section of the course should prepare you for the number of things you need to do whether you

16
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:45,090
want to optimize the stuff you write and publish the code on your pages the way Google indexes your

17
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:46,790
site or all of the above.

18
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:49,530
You've got what you need to do it in its most basic form.

19
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:54,060
But for those of you who are interested in outsourcing this Ã¦sir work there's a few things you probably

20
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:55,930
should consider before hiring anyone.

21
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:59,730
They're going to figure out exactly what work you want an easier person to do.

22
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:04,560
Is it just the keyword research or the reporting on analytics or optimizing the code on your site or

23
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,920
is it multiple tasks.

24
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:10,260
Generally speaking some of these tasks have a finite amount of work to them.

25
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:14,550
You can only optimize your pages so much until they're optimized and you're done.

26
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:20,700
Same thing with like page download speed but link building there's no cap to that.

27
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,520
I mean you can just keep building links for ever.

28
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,700
It's not like you hit 100 and you're just done.

29
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:29,660
You didn't really need to know what part of SCEA work you want them to be on.

30
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,420
And then especially if it's something you just don't have time to do or if it's something you want a

31
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:34,930
long term effort towards.

32
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:38,390
Now what they do and what they specialize will definitely affect what you pay them.

33
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,350
Number two is figure out exactly what you hope to gain by hiring an SCA person what are your goals here

34
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:43,920
exactly.

35
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:49,920
You want improved rankings more traffic more keywords optimized or to free up your time so you can concentrate

36
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,030
on growing the business or whatever else you need to do.

37
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:58,470
You need some ways to measure the work your SEO pro is doing and to make sure your investment in them

38
00:01:58,470 --> 00:01:59,260
is paying off.

39
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,600
Which leads me to figure out how much you can afford to pay them.

40
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:07,500
Now an optimized Web site that continues to produce regular content to grow its audience and as a result

41
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,260
other metrics should improve as well.

42
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:14,580
Like revenue or registered users to improve Etzion site performance Well you need to invest.

43
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:16,340
Now how much is that worth it to you.

44
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:20,910
Maybe it's a monthly amount you could range anywhere from a few hundred dollars for smaller sites to

45
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:25,720
a lot of thousands for big ones or you might decide to spend a couple thousand for a one time.

46
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:28,200
Get me Cascio ready type of project.

47
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,260
You'll need to really figure this out on your own.

48
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:34,890
Well you don't want to happen is when you hire NSU person is for them to use poor techniques to try

49
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:36,610
and achieve the goals you set for them.

50
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,310
That can damage your site especially if they use shady techniques that could potentially get your site

51
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:42,740
penalized by Google.

52
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:48,840
So review any perspective CEO person's priorities and ask about which techniques they'd used to optimize

53
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,280
different parts of your site build traffic or improved keyword rankings.

54
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:57,590
Keep in mind a lot of times you ask them that they'll respond with a giant mouthful of buzzwords.

55
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:02,280
Hopefully through this section though you have a somewhat of an idea to tell what they're talking about

56
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,720
and you should be able to recognize the things that are black hat and which ones are not.

57
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,350
It's also worth asking for a list of past clients and ask for their performance.

58
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:12,560
Make sure their work and ideals match up with yours.

59
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:18,810
At the end of the day in the end you might only need an SCA pro to get you started or just to do the

60
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:21,090
technical optimization for you.

61
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:26,130
Or you might actually need them periodically to check back in and review as you create more stuff.

62
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:27,380
Either way you can be an investment.

63
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:31,550
That does make sense for you when you take your larger strategy in mind.

64
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:38,660
If you are making something that has a lot of really juicy longtail keyword opportunities and there

65
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:44,420
is a lot of longtail opportunities where the search results on it are just not very good.

66
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:45,600
They're not optimized.

67
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:47,040
They're not relevant.

68
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:49,630
And the competition in general is just low.

69
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:54,930
Well then SU might be something you move up in terms of priority but if you're against something that's

70
00:03:54,930 --> 00:04:01,560
too generic like our productivity app and you have no idea how to really go after keywords you can target

71
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:06,210
while maybe you want to do some of this yourself and then see if it's actually rewarding makes sense

72
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:09,740
and whether you can get even a little bit of success before you hire someone.

73
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,410
Anyway that's the lowdown on SCEA.

74
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:15,890
Now there's a lot to consider when it comes to optimizing your words your code and your website.

75
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:19,740
What we've covered here can get you in good shape for the task of growing your audience and getting

76
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:20,530
your site found.

77
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:24,200
Which is the next step to getting from 500 customers to you without it.

78
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:27,120
Good luck and I'll look for you and your site on the interweb.
