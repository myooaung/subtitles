1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:02,050
Hey guys welcome back.

2
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:07,790
The last four lectures we've talked through tactics for creating content that can be controversial that

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,710
can be hyper topical.

4
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:11,460
And one other one.

5
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:17,020
Well now it's time to climb the mountain and discuss how to create a piece of content bigger and better

6
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,030
than anyone else's.

7
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:23,050
Bigger and better this kind of sounds like every strategy from every movie bad guy ever right.

8
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:27,690
Bigger and better guns bigger and better viruses bigger and better robots.

9
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:30,990
Well when it comes to content it's really not that dramatic.

10
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:37,450
So we're going to talk about the skyscraper technique now a skyscraper technique is basically looking

11
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:41,910
at a popular piece of content and saying hey I can do better than that.

12
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:43,480
And then actually doing it.

13
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:48,370
It's called like this because when you look at a city skyline What's the thing that catches your eye.

14
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,600
Most often it's probably going to be the tallest building right.

15
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:54,460
Well and content marketing of bigger can be better.

16
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:59,560
Especially in the eyes of people looking for that quality content they want so badly.

17
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:04,060
This is part of the reason we talked about long form content a few lectures back ultimate guides and

18
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:10,150
things like that attract attention because of the promise that it will be the ultimate The tallest skyscraper

19
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:10,530
ever.

20
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:16,010
Well for the skyscraper method of creating content we're going to look for ways to improve upon listicle.

21
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:22,430
Remember those top ten ways Redwine is better than water or 47 surprising reasons I love cheese.

22
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:23,400
Stuff like that.

23
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,610
Well bigger can be better and more.

24
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:31,870
Surely there are more items you could add to a listicle about a topic relevant to your audience.

25
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:36,700
This is the thinking behind the skyscraper method if you want to get your audience's attention.

26
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,140
Build a better skyscraper.

27
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:44,990
A longer guide or a longer listicle will obviously be better than the other ones.

28
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:51,030
Then what can happen is Google's CEO or Google's search will favor you because it's bigger and better

29
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:57,520
and what you can do very easily is go to the piece that you're beating and steal all their links.

30
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:03,860
Look at all the people that link to them using a tool like h Raf's a h r s.

31
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:08,140
Figure out who's linking to them and then contact them and say Hey I noticed you linked to this.

32
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:12,210
This piece of content on this person's web site I mean a much much better version.

33
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:15,130
Would you like to link to instead most of the time they say yes.

34
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:20,410
So the first step for the skyscraper method is to find the biggest most popular skyscrapers and town.

35
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:22,380
Well that means it's time to do some research.

36
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,340
Which list goes in your industry are getting the most shares and the most links from other sites to

37
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:28,160
figure that out.

38
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:32,890
We can use a tool like Buzz sumo which we've checked out before in the lecture where we used it to find

39
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:34,100
things to write about.

40
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:40,140
Or if you're looking for a buzzy alternative you could also try out the one I just read mentioned A.H.

41
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:46,150
refs which a lot of people really seem to like because it has a feature called content explore that

42
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:48,990
provides a little bit more detail than both sumo does.

43
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,680
So when you do these searches you want to look for the most shares and the most referrals were links

44
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:55,600
to the posts from other sites.

45
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:57,160
That means they've been shared a lot.

46
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,830
People really value the content.

47
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:03,850
The thinking here is that if people like that post then if you create one that's bigger they'll like

48
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:08,720
that too and hopefully you can get shares and engagement that's just as good if not better.

49
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,140
For now let's try a scenario news bus but summa.

50
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:16,180
Let's say you're a freelance digital artist and people always ask for your advice on how to use Illustrator.

51
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:19,870
You know there's a lot of tutorials out there so you've decided to put together the biggest list of

52
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:22,220
Illustrator tutorials that you possibly can.

53
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:27,990
Well you can start by just going out to buzz sumo the most free for the first three searches I think

54
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,320
per day.

55
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:32,620
So if you're cheap like me you need not to waste money on your searches.

56
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:37,310
So let's get right to the point just type in Illustrator tutorials or whatever your term would be.

57
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:38,890
Here's what we see for our search.

58
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:44,250
The top five search results are listed with 26 40 20 and 25 items each.

59
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:47,910
And if you click through on the second one it's actually got 27 tutorials in it.

60
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:52,040
So they're pretty much all lists now just how popular are these listicle.

61
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:56,140
Well you look at the stats on the page of colored circles over on the right you'll see the first two

62
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:56,620
articles.

63
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:59,370
Killed on Pinterest with over 2000 shares each.

64
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:03,850
The last you also did well on Pinterest and third one was a big hit on Facebook by the way if you take

65
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:10,210
a closer look you'll see that four of the articles here came from the same web site graphic design junction.

66
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:13,430
Clearly they know what they're doing when they comes in creating listicle.

67
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,260
OK fair enough.

68
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:18,580
All of them look like pretty popular list so we can use these articles for research and inspiration.

69
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:21,640
Help us build our own or listicle.

70
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:26,260
Well views in that skyscraper method that means we want to create a bigger list than anything we found

71
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:26,750
here.

72
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,890
So the biggest list here is 40.

73
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:33,510
Well technically we would have to create a list that's at least 41 to accomplish our goal.

74
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:33,980
Right.

75
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:35,830
Well as it turns out is not the price is right.

76
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:41,550
You don't just bid slightly higher than them to win your dream vacation in a minivan.

77
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,080
Let's do better than simply one upping the biggest list.

78
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:47,890
No other reason use a skyscraper technique is to intimidate the competition.

79
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:53,290
See how big you can make your new list so nobody else is tempted to try and skyscraper you.

80
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:57,600
If you do some quick math and add together the list numbers from the five list goes we found through

81
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:00,980
but somehow it comes out to just over turn 50.

82
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:07,460
Does this mean that by using all the items in those five lists we can put together a top a top 150 Illustrated

83
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:08,960
tutorials listicle.

84
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,480
Theoretically yes.

85
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:12,570
But here's why that wouldn't happen.

86
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:16,300
First off don't just copy and paste my friend that's lazy.

87
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:18,790
I said use them for research inspiration.

88
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,050
Don't just rip them off.

89
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:22,730
But does that mean we can't use any of the items on their list.

90
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:23,930
Well of course you can.

91
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:26,480
Otherwise how would you get 150 tutorials.

92
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:30,990
Probably not even that many out there but do it with some actual thought and originality.

93
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:35,240
They listen item and give a description and analysis and come up with your own description and analysis

94
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:36,410
put in the work.

95
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:42,050
The second reason your item can't be a hundred fifty items long is that well over 150 total items in

96
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:42,650
these lists.

97
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:48,020
There's bound to be duplicate these five lists all came out on the same time MiddleEast 2000 so they

98
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,670
might have listed the same items.

99
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:52,110
Maybe is only 100 unique items maybe more.

100
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:53,530
I don't know you have to see for yourself.

101
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:56,970
I don't know the reason of 150 items these other riders picked.

102
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,940
They're going to disagree with some of them.

103
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:02,270
You should review each one of these before you add them to your own list.

104
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,950
Again do the work.

105
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,150
Don't just post.

106
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:09,890
I found 150 tutorials give the ones that are worth actually linking to.

107
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:16,430
So in the end maybe you can cobble together a big list of 75 good solid unique items from these five

108
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,080
listicle.

109
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:20,740
Well you know what 75 is a way better than the other list.

110
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,490
That sounds like the making of a pretty nice skyscraper.

111
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:27,370
OK I the first step of the skyscraper technique is to find the biggest skyscrapers in town.

112
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:29,900
The second step is to start building your own.

113
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:33,960
Now that you've found your research articles fear inspiration whatever you want to call those pieces

114
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,730
you're going to blow out of the water.

115
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,160
Start creating your own draft.

116
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,410
Check each item in each list you found.

117
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:43,110
Start highlighting the ones you want to use and omit the ones you don't want.

118
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:48,410
After a while you'll probably have a long enough draft of what this new post should and will look like

119
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:53,360
at some point you may discover you don't have 75 items yet but more like I don't know 60.

120
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:57,060
Well that's fine because here's an opportunity and some important advice for you.

121
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,780
Make it a priority to add new content of your own.

122
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:04,250
For one thing you don't want to look like a jerk and just copy and paste items from other lists that

123
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,270
other people made.

124
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,390
You really need to put your own stamp on it.

125
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,540
But even more important.

126
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:14,720
You want this to be the latest up to date list of Illustrator tutorials or chocolate chip cookie recipes

127
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,220
or whatever it is that you're trying to skyscraper.

128
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:22,940
Specifically look for content from the last month or two so this thing really looks like it's brand

129
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:23,440
new.

130
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:27,920
In fact a search for recent content is something you can do in Bassoul help by changing the date filter

131
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,320
in the upper left corner of the search results.

132
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:34,910
Change the date filter rerun your search and you might find an even newer listicle than the others you've

133
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:35,650
been using.

134
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:41,930
Beyond both sumo and out to Google or YouTube or wherever else you'll find your own items and just start

135
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:43,550
adding new ones to your list.

136
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:48,230
Now once you have your list to the size that you want it and some shine to your skyscraper click through

137
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:50,270
on those graphic design junction articles.

138
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:53,940
You know the ones from the original five listicle were used for research but summa.

139
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:59,060
You'll see the list are all laid out presented the same way for each item there's a clear title description

140
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:02,060
a big graphic and a link to check out the tutorial.

141
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:07,340
The other article in the top 5 shows each item on a separate page so there there's this navigation element

142
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:08,210
on the top.

143
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:12,680
It's a little clunky so if I had to choose between the two I'd probably go with the layout graphic design

144
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:15,860
junction uses and list them all out at once.

145
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:19,600
But those really aren't our only choices of course.

146
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,900
I'm going to do a list of 75 illustrator tutorials That's pretty long.

147
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:26,350
Maybe some navigation and a long list would work together.

148
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:32,090
Maybe I group some of these tutorials by a common theme or subtopic like 10 illustrator or tutorials

149
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:37,370
for creating business logos and 12 tutorials for creating images of people or I don't know something

150
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:38,190
like that.

151
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:43,190
Basically just consider how you can improve upon those other lists you found in both quantity and quality

152
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:47,600
making lists easier to read and navigate well I'm sure more people will read through it and possibly

153
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,140
share it.

154
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:53,330
So finished building that skyscraper of yours write it up real nice create cool graphics for it add

155
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:59,120
some navigation or whatever you choose to do and whatever you think will make it obviously better once

156
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,320
you've got it done and ready for publishing is one more step you can take to help this become a success

157
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:05,610
and that is you guessed it to promote it.

158
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:10,250
In our scenario the original sources are those five listicle we've been focusing on since our original

159
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,520
post to my research.

160
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:16,880
Logic would suggest that whoever liked and shared those with the goals would have to like a bigger and

161
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,310
better and newer version of it right.

162
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:19,860
Well yeah.

163
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:23,540
And it's not too much of a stretch and this is why we're making this skyscraper.

164
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:28,010
We want to generate engagement results that are as good if not better than those original sources.

165
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,140
So is it possible to find the people who shared those original links.

166
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:36,810
Well you can but this is good it gets a little tricky especially if you're on a budget.

167
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:41,750
Now Buzzie even has a paid pro version and if you have that you got to just see exactly who shared the

168
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:44,400
list schools you found linked through social channels.

169
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,880
The same goes for a h.

170
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:51,830
Graphs and also has a paid services while but it will provide a list of linked shares or think in their

171
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:52,920
free version.

172
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:54,360
You have to pay to get more of them.

173
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:57,950
So if you want to pony up the money and figure out who shared those original listicle is the name of

174
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:00,100
a great list of people to tell about your new.

175
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,740
Then it's up to you to contact them via social media or email politely ask them to give your list a

176
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:08,500
look and to share you send them an email it might go something like this.

177
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:13,220
Hey I see you share this article while back Portie illustrator tutorials and you know include a link

178
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,920
to it so what the hell are you talking about.

179
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:16,990
That's a great purpose and inspired me to create my own.

180
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,330
My article has 75 items including recent ones from this year.

181
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:25,250
And now you see why I recommended you include recent content right so you can say this like oh no we

182
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,030
want to share stuff that's out of date.

183
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,630
I'd appreciate if you might consider sharing my posts as well.

184
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:30,530
Here's a link to it.

185
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:31,490
Thanks so much for your help.

186
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:32,160
Cheers.

187
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,430
Kanye West or whatever your name is.

188
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:35,260
You get the idea.

189
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:40,520
Don't be pushy though I understand you're asking for something but if they see you're delivering something

190
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:44,620
bigger and better than those other lists it saves them the time from looking for it.

191
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:46,680
Most likely they'll think you and share it.

192
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:51,380
Now if you don't have the money to pay for those services like a raft both soon what exactly can you

193
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:51,710
do.

194
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:55,310
Well just promote your skyscraper in the same way you pro any other piece of content.

195
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:58,070
Look for an interested audience and share the link with them.

196
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:02,690
Coming up in our series of lectures we're going to specifically cover how to promote your content and

197
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:04,160
then it will be especially relevant.

198
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,870
But until then you can return your bus.

199
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:06,550
You must search.

200
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:10,870
Pay close attention to the platform where your search results got the most shares and engagement.

201
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:15,380
Four of the five list goals we use for research got tons of shares on Pinterest.

202
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:17,780
So there's a place we can start for you.

203
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:20,110
It might be Facebook or elsewhere.

204
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:23,220
If those pieces did well on that platform then you are bigger and better.

205
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,990
Peace has a great chance there as well.

206
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:31,280
So search listicle by name on that platform and seeping find users or groups and you might find opportunities

207
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,310
that suggests your link to them personally.

208
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:37,310
Being on the platform might be able to direct message them or you might just comment on a post of theirs.

209
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:38,860
Either way don't be pushy.

210
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:41,390
Share your stuff and then thank people for your consideration.

211
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:46,130
Alternatively you can also just use google and try to search for that you are on the page that you're

212
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:52,860
trying to beat because it'll show you are ELB then it'll also show anybody else who included that link.

213
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:57,770
So a lot of times you'll find blogs that link to it anyway so those promotional steps can help you get

214
00:11:57,770 --> 00:12:01,090
your skyscraper in of the view of people who have shared similar items before.

215
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:06,530
Remember you want to create something bigger and better and complementing items you find from popular

216
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:11,350
lists with your own original research and content will make yours as unique as possible.

217
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,880
Now Best of luck with those skyscrapers I'll see you guys in the next lecture.
