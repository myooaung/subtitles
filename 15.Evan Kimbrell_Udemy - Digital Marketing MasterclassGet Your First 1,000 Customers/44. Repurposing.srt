00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,020
Hey guys welcome back to the chorus.

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:04,530
OK we're nearly done with our content strategy series.

3
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:05,550
I promise.

4
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:10,050
Now we just talked about how to figure out if your content is working and using measurement and metrics

5
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:13,900
to discover which content pieces are doing well and which ones not so much.

6
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:19,110
Well even now after your content has been published and got some results your job still is not done.

7
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:22,160
It's like that last movie in The Lord Of The Rings trilogy.

8
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,820
You know if you like that ending well you'll love this ending as well.

9
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:27,050
And then this ending.

10
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:27,590
Yeah.

11
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:28,370
We're not done yet.

12
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:32,790
There's another strategy you should always be thinking about as you're creating a piece of content especially

13
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:38,100
after it's been published and that's how to repurpose it repurpose in content and means finding a new

14
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,740
place and or a new function for your content.

15
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:46,080
In other words you can use what you've created somewhere else with very little effort and basically

16
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,240
create something new out of something all.

17
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,760
And this is what we're going to talk about in this lecture.

18
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,080
Let's say you write a killer blog post in the top five reasons Wordpress is the best platform for new

19
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:55,720
bloggers.

20
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:58,960
You've done your research cited some data maybe added some screenshots.

21
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:02,120
It's a post you believe has value for the beginners out there.

22
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,050
When you repurpose content you could either reformat the entire piece for a different channel or you

23
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:10,780
could clip out an excerpt a specific value and post or share just that.

24
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:16,220
But you might be asking well if I made such a great blog post in the first place why bother repurposing

25
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:16,740
anything.

26
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,850
Shouldn't that be all I need to do.

27
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:24,660
And don't I want to drive people to that one piece of content while repurposing is really about extending

28
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:26,310
the value of that original piece.

29
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:30,990
If that content has value it makes sense to milk it for as much as you can get out of it for all the

30
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:35,230
hard work done after you've written it with different formats you might reach new people who just didn't

31
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:41,040
want to read a blog post or are more happy to say watch a video made with that same original stuff.

32
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:45,840
And your audience members will be found in different places so publishing in only one place means those

33
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,380
people who really live on other platforms might miss out.

34
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:53,710
So let's say for that five reasons to use Wordpress blog we just talked about.

35
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:58,590
You could turn it into a video where you deliver everything on camera.

36
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:01,800
Maybe mixed in some visuals and then you post that instead on YouTube.

37
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:06,570
You could turn it into let's say an info graphic with big bold graphics and share it on your blog or

38
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:10,840
some infographics friendly platform like Linked In or even Pinterest.

39
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,830
You could reword it into an answer on Quora.

40
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:18,450
Look for a question where someone asks what beginners should use to start a blog and then reformat your

41
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:20,600
words so they can work as an answer.

42
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:27,210
Now keep in mind this is not a cut and paste job but also it really should not take you as long to just

43
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:31,110
reword the material as it would to just write it from scratch.

44
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:35,730
I'd generally like to think of it kind of like an 80:20 you wrote the original post that took 80 percent

45
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:36,300
of the effort.

46
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:43,120
Now you just need a little bit of 20 percent to then spread it from one spot to potentially 15.

47
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:48,870
So there are a few options for repurposed you create images or a slideshow and put it on Instagram.

48
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,670
You take the quotes or images and you can post on Facebook or Twitter.

49
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:57,720
You even combine a post with others and create an e-book available for download on your site like a

50
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,520
chef in a kitchen full of ingredients.

51
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,170
It's up to you to decide what to make.

52
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:05,940
If you repurpose content though you want to consider a different format or platform it promises some

53
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:06,960
opportunity.

54
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:12,280
That is if none of your customers or your audience really like videos or hang out on YouTube.

55
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:15,360
Well then repurchasing your content into the video format.

56
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:17,790
Just talked about probably doesn't make a lot of sense.

57
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:20,450
How do you know what platforms your audience uses.

58
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:25,860
Well that just comes back to doing your basic demographic research your basic Geographic and your basic

59
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:26,830
psychographic.

60
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:28,230
You can always just ask them.

61
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:29,160
That's very common.

62
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,460
Ask them Do you have a link.

63
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,330
Do you watch YouTube when you want to find something out.

64
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:34,580
Do you Google it.

65
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:39,960
Or do you search on Google or do you ask someone in general look for places or content types that appeal

66
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,440
to your audience where they hang out online.

67
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:48,600
What content types are performed well for you before if generally post a blog that was a video to begin

68
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:53,420
with and it didn't do well you probably guessed that repurposing your stuff and sticking it on video

69
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:56,930
on YouTube doesn't have as much promise as something else.

70
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:01,890
Look to your measurements and your metrics and even your social media analytics to see if you can spot

71
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:07,170
some trends you might discover that certain posts really engaged people and that can lead to some ideas

72
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:08,880
on how to repurpose your stuff.

73
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:12,810
Now you might discover that it's easier to share a piece of your original content of reformatting the

74
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:13,790
whole thing.

75
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:14,720
That's definitely an option.

76
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:19,180
Also worth considering in your five reasons use Wordpress blog post.

77
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:24,240
You could take the five reasons and then make a short video or graphic listing of the reasons but leave

78
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,650
out the best details.

79
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:30,780
For example here are the five reasons but if you want to learn why these reasons are important or how

80
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:34,200
to use these your advantage and follow the link in the original blog post.

81
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:38,800
Not only are you repurposing your content in situation but you're also really promoting it.

82
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:44,100
Some other easy ways to repurpose pieces of content are to share key statements or quotes key pieces

83
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:48,300
of data or graphs or screenshots or video excerpts whatever pieces you share.

84
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:53,160
Make sure you always focus on promising value and driving people back to your original blog post or

85
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,040
piece of content.

86
00:04:54,040 --> 00:05:00,470
So consider what other platforms people will use to look for the value offer or where Ask questions

87
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:01,610
that need to be answered.

88
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:06,260
Remember that you might have spent a great deal of time researching and drafting and perfecting your

89
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:09,560
content so it deserves some extra attention and promotion.

90
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,940
Or maybe you didn't spend a lot of time creating it at all it doesn't matter.

91
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,320
Value is value right.

92
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:19,870
If it's good you need to get it out there in different places in different spaces so that's it guys

93
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,760
repurpose your content and make the most of what you've created.

94
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:28,790
Next up we're going to start talking about video marketing how to market specifically video content

95
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:31,130
and how that differs from everything else.

96
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:32,500
All right guys I'll see you then.
