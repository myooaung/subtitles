00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:01,760
Hey guys welcome back to the course.

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:06,480
So when you started looking into different platforms and places to help us come up with ideas for our

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,360
content.

4
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:11,790
Well now I want to bring this back to a tool we've actually used before in this course if you're paying

5
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:12,370
attention.

6
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:18,060
Do you have that tool used in the government or section it was but it helped us find popular articles

7
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:22,400
had something to do with sumo wrestlers that jog your memory.

8
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:27,510
Well it is called Buzz sumo and it's boomeranging back here into this lecture a lot of the solvers will

9
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:33,420
talk about are actually pretty multi-purpose So you'll see them popping up over and over as you get

10
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:34,440
more customers.

11
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,360
So quick refresher what is buzz.

12
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:42,030
Sumo is a site that indexes all the popular articles and links that are being shared and engaged with

13
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:43,460
on social media.

14
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:48,780
Last time we use this service to find people sharing things on Twitter and then we kind of stink guide

15
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:50,090
them into buying our stuff.

16
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,540
But guess what.

17
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:54,930
We can also use it as a source of inspiration for writing our content.

18
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,430
How do we do that.

19
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:57,720
Well I will tell you.

20
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:57,980
OK.

21
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:02,610
Let's go to buzz Sudhakar and you should see this lovely screen that you're already familiar with.

22
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:04,380
It works just like any other search engine.

23
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:05,700
Just use the box in the middle.

24
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:06,270
OK.

25
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:07,830
What do I put in it.

26
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:13,920
While you're going to put in it terms you think relate to your product or service or things you think

27
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,200
your customers might be looking for in general.

28
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,190
Remember the search terms we put together for the Google autocomplete lecture.

29
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,080
Those are a great place to start.

30
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:26,910
If you've made an app for dog owners like let's say that app that has billboards all over San Francisco

31
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:32,760
right now called Barker like wolf or something like that your audience will probably search for app

32
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:36,210
for walking my dog or they might search for dog walking app if you want.

33
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:41,610
You can certainly search something broad like dog walking out because there's sure to be some relevancy

34
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:46,830
there but also make sure it includes some specific terms for what your product or service actually does.

35
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:48,970
Your app is for I don't know.

36
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:52,850
It's a finding last minute deals on doggie hotels.

37
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,140
Yeah that's actually a thing.

38
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:54,770
OK.

39
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:01,320
Then make sure you search for that find a hotel for my dog a place to sleep for my dog.

40
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:06,540
But of course be careful not to search for a place to put my dog to sleep because search results can

41
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:07,830
be tricky for that one.

42
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:12,440
So once you start trying these searches and Buzz Sumate and you'll see a list that looks like this.

43
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:16,560
Now out of this list which results do you actually think would help you.

44
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:18,790
You can even pause and zoom in if you want.

45
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:20,570
Take a second peek through the list.

46
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:20,950
OK.

47
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:21,570
Did you do it.

48
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:23,600
Probably not but it's ok.

49
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,990
It's not immediately obvious which ones are the ones that are worth looking at.

50
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,290
But here's the short of it.

51
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:31,660
See those multicolored circles to the right of the article name.

52
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,310
Those are the metrics that track engagement now is good engagement.

53
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:41,970
Absolute proof of a good article or piece of content not necessarily good engagement is generally positively

54
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:43,850
associated with the content value.

55
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:46,740
In general people engage more with better stuff.

56
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,290
That's really all I can say about it.

57
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:50,520
OK well that's one point to take in.

58
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:56,190
So after view quickly scandalous try actually going into the posts themselves don't just rely on the

59
00:02:56,190 --> 00:03:01,270
engagement metrics because they're not really a sure shot indicator of quality.

60
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:05,040
But there's a correlation when you go and look at the articles.

61
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,510
Try reading some of them.

62
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:12,150
That alone might give you some ideas past that taking notice of how the article is put together.

63
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:13,950
How long is the post.

64
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,680
Does it have pictures or videos.

65
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:18,880
Do they link to tons of different things inside of the body copy.

66
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:25,260
What about the headline was it juicy and did it peak your interest or was it really just plain vanilla

67
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:25,880
ice cream.

68
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:29,690
All these elements can give you some ideas as to what made the post work.

69
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:32,280
Look at multiple posts and you might find some patterns.

70
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:37,830
You might notice for instance that all the popular long form content with lots of photos and high engagement

71
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:41,220
are coming from one specific source or even one author.

72
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,320
Over and over again.

73
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:47,550
If that's the case well take a note of that source and or the author and make it a routine to check

74
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:52,200
in and see what they're talking about because hey they're clearly doing something right.

75
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:56,940
Throw them in your favorite sources list or follow them if you feel so inclined.

76
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:02,050
And if you do one round of this don't stop keep playing with the search and the different filters add

77
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:02,740
a term.

78
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,130
Try taking away one.

79
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:06,780
Use the date filter to see what's more recent.

80
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:11,580
Keep fine tuning it until you've got a list of content pieces that are relevant to your space and are

81
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,250
performing decently well.

82
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:17,370
That list right there is gold for focusing your brainstorming efforts now.

83
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:23,430
A common mistake I see in early content marketing efforts is that people keep tabs on what's been said

84
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:27,070
but they follow pretty much anyone and everyone.

85
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:33,060
What that does is it makes it such that you subconsciously try to emulate sources that really are not

86
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,220
worth emulating.

87
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:39,780
You really only want to focus your time and attention on that 100 percent Colombian peer stuff the stuff

88
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:46,470
that actually works and is actually forwarding the collective conversation forward not just copying

89
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:49,880
and and being reactive with nothing original to say.

90
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:56,130
So just make sure that you're following the good stuff and not the copycats that were doing their metoo

91
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:56,750
articles.

92
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:57,990
OK so let's recap it.

93
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:02,810
There's no real finish line to this Tivoli I'm just showing you a pretty path you can take in the ones

94
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:06,640
that will expose you to enough ideas to help you start the brainstorming process.

95
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:11,300
And in that process find authoritative figures with successful content that are worth following.

96
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:16,190
In this lecture we covered buzz sumo basically a search engine that lists out content that's been made

97
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:21,020
and it tells you how popular it wasn't social media buzz sumos gives you autosuggestion suggestions

98
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:23,970
for things that have already been written about that that are similar.

99
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:28,280
That's great and it also lets you conveniently see which ones perform better than others.

100
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:31,850
Now that's important because you don't want to build your content strategy off crap.

101
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:34,070
Make sure to take a peek at how the content was set up.

102
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:35,690
Look at the length look at the headline.

103
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:40,850
Let's look at the embedded media and that sort of thing and use that just as a general way of getting

104
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:43,380
a better idea of what works in your niche.

105
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,840
OK you got it.

106
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,850
Try it out or die I don't care.

107
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:47,870
I'll see you in the next lecture.
