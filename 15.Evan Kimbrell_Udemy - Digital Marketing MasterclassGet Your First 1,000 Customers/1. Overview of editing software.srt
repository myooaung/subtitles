1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,590
Are you guys welcome back.

2
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:06,540
So in the past dozen or so lectures we've covered the basics of video production from our first steps

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:11,790
in pre-production where we figured out what we're going to do and then through production where we actually

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,370
went and made everything.

5
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:19,500
Now all that work with preparation lighting audio and video hopefully led to an easy and rewarding shoot

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,700
where you used all that equipment.

7
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:25,400
We talked about so much with perfect accuracy and where nothing ever went wrong.

8
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,580
Was he kidding there's always something that goes wrong.

9
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:32,520
Moore's Law is definitely something that applies to video production and well maybe you haven't shot

10
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:34,390
any video yet you want to do it all later.

11
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:35,950
That is perfectly fine as well.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,650
Well either way that leads us to the next phase which is post-production.

13
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:44,130
Now it's time to assemble all those video pieces into an amazing finished product.

14
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:48,270
This might seem daunting if you haven't done it before but we've already got our script to guide us

15
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:48,880
right.

16
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:53,670
I certainly hope you wrote a script now whatever you got from a rough outline to a detailed script or

17
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:56,430
even that one in the middle we talked about the two sentence script.

18
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:59,520
Maybe you even have a storyboard if you went crazy with it.

19
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,170
It will help you put together all the pieces for editing now.

20
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:07,200
In fact when we say post-production most of the time we're really talking about editing which is the

21
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,090
process of assembling the raw video pieces you recorded in the right order cutting out the bad parts

22
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:17,640
and bad takes stitching everything together so it looks smooth sinking the audio.

23
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,920
Deciding which camera to show what time etc etc..

24
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:24,150
Then the job of editing is to add finishing touches.

25
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:29,520
Now these finishing touches could be anything like adding transitions or basically things like fades

26
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,750
or dissolves.

27
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:33,770
Really just different ways to go from one shot or scene to the next.

28
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:39,540
We can do things like titles which basically means adding words to your video which can be text on a

29
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:43,140
screen somewhere or full screen graphics you just slide in there to show.

30
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:46,670
I don't know logos taglines or separate sections of a video.

31
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,770
I do this all the time.

32
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:53,210
I usually sit at the bottom of what's called a lower third title and sometimes I put it over my shoulder.

33
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:57,360
You can also add sound in music where you add more audio beyond the stuff you recorded with your main

34
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,710
subjects during production.

35
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:03,120
Maybe you need some sound effects to make the video cooler or might you just want to add some background

36
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,870
music to make your talking head video a little bit less awkward.

37
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,460
Now there's more you can do and we'll talk more about that stuff when we jump into an editing program

38
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:12,260
in our next lecture.

39
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:14,170
But that brings up a great question.

40
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,980
What kind of video editing software should you need.

41
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:19,470
Now let me give you a quick rundown.

42
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:23,480
Regardless of whether or not you're actually going to do the editing yourself if you're on a budget

43
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,210
yeah you should do the editing yourself.

44
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:29,880
If you're hiring someone else I think you should still learn the basics of it so that when you do hire

45
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:34,060
someone and work with them you can actually communicate effectively and know what they're talking about.

46
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:38,460
Now there are really three different categories of editing software at the bottom you've got the amateur

47
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:43,440
level and these are the things that your moms and dads will want to use to edit photos taken in their

48
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,430
iPhones from placation or soccer games with their cats chasing laser pointers.

49
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:53,250
They're going to use like video editor apps on their phone or a free program like i movie on the Mac.

50
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:54,980
Those programs do basic editing.

51
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:58,180
And those people don't generally need more than that now.

52
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:01,800
But at the top of the spectrum you have professional level editing programs.

53
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:06,180
Now these are for people who cut videos for a living whether it's you know instructional lectures like

54
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:11,270
this one movie trailers commercials you name it they need full featured programs with lots of power

55
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,640
especially if they're into creating special effects or animation.

56
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:19,740
It's possible you might be on this level if you have lots of experience editing video but some of the

57
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:25,350
pro software choices here can be a bit pricey but then of course you have the in-betweens So if you're

58
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:29,140
not an amateur you're not a pro Well you're somewhere in the middle and that's if i guess that's where

59
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:30,450
most you guys are.

60
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:32,160
Now that's the content creator level.

61
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:36,190
You plan on producing videos regularly you want them to look and sound awesome.

62
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:41,160
You might be dipping into some features to make them look even cooler but at the end of the day making

63
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:46,770
videos is not your life and you're not doing anything that hasn't been done a million times somewhere

64
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:47,260
else.

65
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,800
You just want software that's got some power behind it in case you need to do something fancy and you

66
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,480
just want to make sure it has a decent array of features and templates that can save you time.

67
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,030
Oh yeah.

68
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:00,870
And you also generally want something that's not going to break the bank entirely.

69
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:05,430
So I'm going to talk about some of the video editing software choices out there with content creators

70
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:10,100
in mind but pros should also pay attention to because there's quite a bit of overlap here.

71
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:10,340
All right.

72
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:14,910
So first we have Adobe Premiere which has been around for a very long time and it's been updated and

73
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:21,030
fleshed out to include just an abnormal amount of features used by video editors of all skill levels

74
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,680
and Adobe Premiere you can import video and audio from pretty much anywhere.

75
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:28,860
And there are a lot of apps and plug ins that are being built just to work with premiere.

76
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:34,210
It's really a powerful piece of software and one great thing about it is it runs on PCs and Macs.

77
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,240
You have a PC and you would hire someone who has a Mac.

78
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,560
Well you can both use premiere and that will actually help you sync up the the work you do.

79
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:44,640
Generally speaking though Adobe going to charge you 20 bucks a month for it.

80
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:50,430
So do you guys already have subscriptions to the Adobe Creative Cloud so maybe you have Photoshop and

81
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:51,290
Illustrator as well.

82
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,760
But it's in that package.

83
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:57,300
And now if you would accidentally fall asleep on your keyboard and ending this lecture I'd be perfectly

84
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:03,430
fine because Adobe Premiere is kind of the Endal all four are our level of video editing.

85
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,410
People who don't know a lot about video editing can use Adobe Premiere.

86
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:11,340
People who wanted to really advance stuff like full feature films can use Adobe Premiere.

87
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:18,330
It's kind of the default thing that the vast majority of editors will use and that's why we're going

88
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:20,380
to focus on it in the next couple of lectures.

89
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:24,870
Now in some cases premiere might be overkill like it's too many features and it takes a little bit too

90
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:29,440
long to pick up and use and that's why often people will stick with all their choices.

91
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:35,260
Now another program that I do want to talk about is what's called Final Cut Pro now Final Cut Pro there's

92
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:41,790
Final Cut Pro and the Final Cut Pro X which is Final Cut Pro 10 but it's essentially Apple's version

93
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:48,330
of Adobe Premiere and only works on Macs with Final Cut Pro It's kind of I consider it kind of in the

94
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:54,510
middle between movie and premiere where you do almost anything and with movie you can you can't really

95
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:59,700
do that much but what you can do you can do very quickly and it's got a lot of prepackaged template

96
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:02,170
stuff by Dhokha prose kind of right in the middle.

97
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:06,720
And it's actually what I edit with because I'm not a professional editor.

98
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:12,600
I have a lot of experience editing but I don't want to do for a living I don't spend thousands of hours

99
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,610
making videos just for fun.

100
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:21,150
Vettel get Pro is a perfect in-between for me it's easy to use but it also has access to a lot of professional

101
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:21,950
features.

102
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:27,920
But then also at the same time it really does focus on using templates and using shortcuts that can

103
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,400
get you to the promised land sooner.

104
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:34,330
So if you have a Mac that's one I definitely think you should check out.

105
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:36,510
It looks a lot better than premiere.

106
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:40,060
It runs a lot better but it is just not as powerful.

107
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:45,570
Now the next two programs I want to mention are there's Cyberlink power director and then there's Coral's

108
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:46,770
video studio.

109
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:51,120
Now these are really just a set below premiere in terms of power and available features but they're

110
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:52,290
also quite a bit cheaper.

111
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:56,580
However if you're someone in the middle range or you just look at Premier and you think it's overwhelming.

112
00:06:56,580 --> 00:07:00,780
Well this is something you probably check out now Power Director and video studio are very similar to

113
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:01,230
each other.

114
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:05,710
They're both under 100 bucks both PC based and they're both you know PC Magazine seems to love them.

115
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:10,530
Power to for instance can support up to a hundred different video tracks at a time which is absolutely

116
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:11,200
crazy.

117
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:15,470
But hey you never know you might need a hundred videos in the same timeline.

118
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,270
That's nuts.

119
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:20,490
Video Studio also has a pretty nice reputation especially with its features including some cool stuff

120
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,760
you can do like with motion tracking.

121
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,330
That's basically where you lock onto a subject on the screen and add some kind of effect directly to

122
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:28,130
it.

123
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:32,880
For example you might want to mask out a license plate of a car in a video or you could add text on

124
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,450
a screen that moves along with a person or an object that's motion tracking.

125
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:39,930
So really those are kind of the four that I would think about.

126
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:42,500
There's obviously ones like Sony Vegas.

127
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:46,100
Some people really like it but it's kind of on the level like Power Director.

128
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:47,890
It's kind of in the middle.

129
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:52,470
If you have a Mac I generally say use Final Cut Pro because unless you really really want to get into

130
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:55,990
your editing it has pretty much everything you would need.

131
00:07:56,050 --> 00:08:03,830
But Dolby from here is pretty easy to actually suggest because there's nothing you really can't do in

132
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,120
it.

133
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:08,580
I mean it is it's really kind of the workhorse of almost all Video Productions.

134
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:12,540
Now aside from your experience level with editing choosing an editing program really comes down to a

135
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:13,800
few different questions.

136
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:19,770
First off how much video do you plan on producing and or in other words how serious is this video thing

137
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:23,400
for you if you're just dipping your toes in the water to see if you even want to make videos it doesn't

138
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:28,930
really make sense to spend a lot of money on equipment editing software but maybe you are ready to die

139
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:30,610
then you're really committed to this.

140
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:33,270
Well then you might need to find something it fits your plans or just pay for it.

141
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:37,590
Now if you have a lot of plans and a lot of videos you want to produce well and you probably should

142
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:39,410
go with something that's more versatile.

143
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:44,160
Now lower tier programs like Video Studio have pump the brakes on all the advanced features and things

144
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:49,950
you could do in a pro-level app like Final Cut Pro or Adobe Premiere but most likely they wouldn't really

145
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:50,770
need anyway.

146
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:54,930
So the video studio you're still getting a quality program it's highly recommended especially if you're

147
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:55,730
just starting out.

148
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:59,690
So if your community videos the next question is what type of videos do you plan on producing.

149
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,580
Not be playing on producing tutorials interviews and straightforward types of videos.

150
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:05,960
You can really use anything really to cut it together.

151
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,610
You need to shop around and look at the specific features you might want.

152
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:11,680
But generally most editing programs can do whatever you need.

153
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:16,080
Any point on doing a lot of screencast you might invest in a screencast recording software or editing

154
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,300
program like Cam Tasia or screenplay.

155
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:20,180
Or if you're cheap just use screencast romantic.

156
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:24,510
Those programs have screencast type features already built and like the ability to do picture and picture

157
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:29,440
mode screen highlighting or record for multiple audio sources and since you can edit your screencast

158
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,780
right in these programs it saves you time.

159
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:37,170
So in the end you could use an app like camp Tasia by itself or you could complement it with premiere

160
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:41,940
as well as Campton use campaign for the screencast take that video throw it into premiere or you edit

161
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:44,190
it in with your normal camera video.

162
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:45,380
Either way pretty legit.

163
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:49,340
So my advice is generally just to look in the mirror and see how serious you are about video.

164
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:54,390
If you're serious about it I'd probably go with Adobe Premiere and it's really only a monthly charge.

165
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:59,600
It's not that bad if you're on a Mac and you want to kind of work in a sweet spot where you want to

166
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:05,300
make good videos but there's nothing really off the top of your head that's really crazy and out there

167
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,370
that you want to do.

168
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:08,040
In Final Cut Pro is a pretty decent option.

169
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:13,890
Unfortunately you have to buy Final Cut Pro upfront and it's like $300 unless you pirate it.

170
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:19,060
But that's you know one thing is taken and 10 in mind is that you have to cough it up up front.

171
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:22,370
Then of course if you just want to stitch stuff together like an interview but you're not really going

172
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:26,960
to focus on editing like putting in graphics and illustrations and effects and things like that you

173
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,140
really don't think that's where you're going to make or break your videos.

174
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:33,550
Well then try looking into some of the other ones like video studio.

175
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,890
All right guys it's really what you need to know about editing software from an informational point

176
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:37,330
of view.

177
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:41,180
But we should definitely dive into a program and see what you can actually do with it.

178
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,560
That's going to be on our next lecture.

179
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:47,660
We're going to tackle Adobe Premiere and it's kind of important regardless of what software you use

180
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:50,660
because all of them have very similar elements.

181
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:51,040
All right guys.

182
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,160
Anyway I'll see you then.
