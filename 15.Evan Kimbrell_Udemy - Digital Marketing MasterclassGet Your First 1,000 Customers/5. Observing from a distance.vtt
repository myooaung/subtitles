00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:06.630
And we are back for step number four in our attempt
to introduce our business or product to the strange
1

2
00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:13.710
land of Reddit. Now is the time to spend an hour or
two just sitting and watching/reading the Reddits
2

3
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.420
we've singled out in our list.
3

4
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:21.690
Like I said before, each sub has its own personality,
so it's really important that you first get it before
4

5
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:23.420
you try to work it over.
5

6
00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:29.670
The first thing I suggest doing is just do a light
scan of the headlines in your sub of choice.
6

7
00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.190
Keep in mind, if you're looking at them, then these are 
the ones that are popular and people already decided
7

8
00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:42.530
are popular. In a lot of subs, you can very quickly isolate 
some themes. In this sub, the "Get studying" sub, after
8

9
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.750
about 20 headlines you start to get the picture.
9

10
00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.290
People are very positive and they love tips,
10

11
00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.870
they love hacks, and they love techniques.
11

12
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:58.470
Pretty much everything is either someone sharing
a skill for studying or not being distracted, or it's
12

13
00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.540
someone asking how to get better at studying.
13

14
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.190
Take a second and go up to the top of this sub, click
14

15
00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.780
Take a second and go up to the top of this sub, click
15

16
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:11.460
"Top." Now, "Top" at first will display the best post
of the week, which is interesting, but we actually want
16

17
00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:18.570
to know what the best of the best posts in a sub of all time
are, so click on "This week" and change it to "All time."
17

18
00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.040
to know what the best of the best posts in a sub of all time
are, so click on "This week" and change it to "All time."
18

19
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.140
Now, this is honestly the best research you can do in a sub.
19

20
00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.990
Everything on the top of all time is absolute gold
and if you'd literally just copy and paste these
20

21
00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.620
links and repost them, they would
probably do equally as well.
21

22
00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:35.790
Don't obviously do that.
22

23
00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:36.920
I'm just trying to make a point.
23

24
00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.560
If you notice the number two one, by the
way, it's for an app that helps you focus.
24

25
00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.350
It's actually a really clever way of posting on Reddit.
25

26
00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.780
That's the kind of stuff ideally we want to emulate.
26

27
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:49.910
OK, so get your fill
27

28
00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:54.930
looking through the posts in each of your subs, try
your best to piece together what people care about,
28

29
00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.490
what they like, and what the tone of the group is.
29

30
00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.900
Especially that last one.
30

31
00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:01.170
Are they sarcastic?
31

32
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.270
Are they funny?
32

33
00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:03.590
Are they inspirational?
33

34
00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.670
Makes a big deal of difference if you
understand the general vibe of the group.
34

35
00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.090
If you really want to challenge yourself,
go up at the top and click "New."
35

36
00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.020
You'll see the posts that have just been posted, and
then try to guess if you think the post will do well.
36

37
00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:22.620
Once you truly get a feel for how the group works,
you'll be able to rattle us off in a couple of seconds,
37

38
00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.500
and you'll rarely get it wrong.
38

39
00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.060
Come back in a couple hours or
the next day and see if you were right.
39

40
00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.540
The last two things I want you to do is go to the sidebar
on the right and read through the rules and guidelines.
40

41
00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:34.320

41

42
00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:35.820
Each sub is different for this.
42

43
00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:40.580
Some are fine, for instance, with promotional
posting, and others are vehemently against it.
43

44
00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.740
If they're against it though, that just
means no blatant advertising.
44

45
00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.060
If you're smart about it, you can make your
post valuable and give yourself exposure.
45

46
00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.600
That's perfectly fine. And then the
last thing to do is make a note,
46

47
00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.700
if you can, of the moderators in the
group. Use that browser extension
47

48
00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.320
we have to tag them, so in the future you can see
where they post and follow what they're doing.
48

49
00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.020
In some subs, they have "Moderator"
next to them, and sometimes they don't.
49

50
00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.340
And sometimes on the right hand bar,
you'll just list off the moderators.
50

51
00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:13.230
If you're really good at this, you can then tell when each mod
is in charge of the post and what their personality is like.
51

52
00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:14.540

is in charge of the post and what their personality is like.
52

53
00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.840
If you then target your efforts for building a rapport
with them, then there's a good chance they'll
53

54
00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.390
give you more leeway with what you can post.
54

55
00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.740
Okay, spend some time and just space out. Next lecture,
55

56
00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.480
we're going to start adding our own voice into the mix.
56

57
00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:28.140
See you then.
