00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:06.730
Hey guys welcome back to the course so we're going to follow along section for Google autocomplete.

2
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:13.350
Yeah I know this one's pretty obvious but it's one of those ones that it's so obvious that people actually

3
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:14.120
skip it.

4
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.200
And obviously there's some hacks to it to make it a little bit more efficient.

5
00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.310
Literally anyone can do this and it saves you enormous amount of time because anything that's going

6
00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:30.190
to show up in Google onto search complete is something that clearly people are searching for.

7
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.150
So generally it's a decent opportunity.

8
00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:38.160
So for me since we're focusing on my course there's a lot of different options I can use and I don't

9
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.410
even have to really get fancy with this one.

10
00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.440
All I really have to do is just search the topics of the courses and see what pops up.

11
00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.500
And that is enough to generate a decent list.

12
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:56.180
So if I of course on outsourcing I can just say let's just say outsourcing.

13
00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.910
OK so the first three are probably worthless but that last one.

14
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.970
Outsourcing pros and cons.

15
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.630
OK.

16
00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.240
That's that is a legitimate opportunity for a post.

17
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.400
I could do that.

18
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:20.980
Let's say if I was doing my web development business courses you see so we want courses can business.

19
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.140
OK so looks like people want a business plan.

20
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.820
OK so if I had a web built in business plan like maybe I can make a template and give that away I could

21
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:38.340
do it as a lead magnet or I could just do it as a like here's a free template check it out see business

22
00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.990
names.

23
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.610
I know this one is actually pretty common.

24
00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.000
I know a lot of people struggle with coming up with a name for a web development business because they're

25
00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.080
pretty generic and a lot of people do them.

26
00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.530
So how do you differentiate yourself.

27
00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:57.900
How do you make a name that what you go off of what isn't already taken what makes sense based on the

28
00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:58.740
industry.

29
00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.060
So that one's pretty easy.

30
00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:07.730
Let's see if put in business ideas business ideas for kids.

31
00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.190
Maybe your teens are not bad.

32
00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:16.170
I don't think I'd want to do it for kids or teenagers though because that's not really my market.

33
00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:24.450
If I said great business ideas great small business ideas great online business.

34
00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.620
Let's see so I could probably go see if we can do that little trick.

35
00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.420
So this is telling me what's going to pop up in the middle.

36
00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.530
How come up with business ideas how to develop business and generate business ideas.

37
00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.670
So nothing really particularly surprising there.

38
00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.730
I was a little tricky.

39
00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:50.430
What am I want to do is just go more granular and focus on the individual lectures or techniques that

40
00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:51.330
we did.

41
00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.770
But if I fiddle with that enough I could probably come up something.

42
00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.640
Let's say if we were focused on my non-technical person's guide course which is basically all about

43
00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:06.840
starting a business that we're going to code it as we say without coding.

44
00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:15.730
So you create a business application without coding kind of created business web site with too low coding

45
00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.200
and generic.

46
00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.300
So maybe not too fruitful Now when we look at our product management.

47
00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.540
Literally say product management and see what pops up interview questions.

48
00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:27.190
Yeah.

49
00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:31.800
So I could make a blog post about common interview questions or I can make one about certification.

50
00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.730
Always a big question.

51
00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:39.220
Some places will certify you for product management and then obviously the question is who and is it

52
00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:40.370
worth it.

53
00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.260
Usually certification or something like that is not worth it.

54
00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:45.780
But tools.

55
00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:51.620
OK that's a decent one if I made a resource page listing on all the product management tools you could

56
00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:56.500
do on comparing all of like the Road Map software that's out there they're just popping up left and

57
00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.680
right so I know that that's probably something that's not saturated.

58
00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.990
OK.

59
00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.360
So that's a good three or four for that one let's think.

60
00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:08.010
Yeah I think that would come up probably seven different ideas.

61
00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:11.500
I can do for my blog right.

62
00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.640
So there were some for outsourcing there are some for web development businesses same thing I could

63
00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.620
do mobile app development businesses product management giving me a lot a little bit trickier business

64
00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.400
ideas but that's just kind of the way that this works is not going to work for every single one and

65
00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.520
that's why we're going to cover four or five different techniques.

66
00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:28.120
Ok cool.

67
00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.080
So these are some ideas that I think could work.

68
00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.060
See you guys next Dr..
