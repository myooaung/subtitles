Hey guys, welcome back to the course. In the last
lectures we covered using the magical spam ability
1

2
00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.550
of that big blue bloated bird we love,
2

3
00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:14.100
and then how to single out the user group your product
appeals to and then connect those that need to
3

4
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.690
be liberated of their cash.
4

5
00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.690
All of those techniques are really easy to do and take
really just like a bare minimum of time, and we'd
5

6
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.410
like to spend a bare minimum of time on getting customers.
6

7
00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.020
Why?
7

8
00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:32.490
Well, because just look outside, there is this thing called grass
and sunlight, and things that aren't your computer screen.
8

9
00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:34.220
Well, because just look outside, there is this thing called grass
and sunlight, and things that aren't your computer screen.
9

10
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.030
Wouldn't it be nice to be out there?
10

11
00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.520
Yes, yes it would.
11

12
00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:38.750
That's why we keep it short.
12

13
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.980
We also like the strategies to be short because we're
at that stage of the process where our product,
13

14
00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.440
although ready to sell, is still significantly in
need of user feedback and some polish.
14

15
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.240
We can't exactly just go out there and start shooting
for thousands of people without expecting to get
15

16
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.500
burned or to waste a ton of
money and time in the process.
16

17
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.850
This is the incremental way of getting from
your current poor self to your future
17

18
00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:11.500
loads of money self. The next strategy we're going to
cover is, well, quite obvious, but also quite effective.
18

19
00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.880
And yes, like the others, it takes very little time.
19

20
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.400
So, in this lecture, we're going to talk about leveraging
your already existing network. Get in the mindset
20

21
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.640
of thinking about the people you know in your life as your network.
Your mom? Network. Your ex-boss who fired you? Network.
21

22
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.420
of thinking about the people you know in your life as your network.
Your mom? Network. Your ex-boss who fired you? Network.
22

23
00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:35.160
These are all people you can touch - not like that - and get into
contact with, because, well, they know who you are. Suckers.
23

24
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.070
These are all people you can touch - not like that - and get into
contact with, because, well, they know who you are. Suckers.
24

25
00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.610
So why do we want to contact our network,
25

26
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.010
other than the fact that they are a group of people
who easily lends you their attention during a time
26

27
00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.790
where getting attention for your
product is probably kind of difficult?
27

28
00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.380
Well, another reason is because if you're going to be
successful in growing your business, you're going
28

29
00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.100
to need to rely on people.
29

30
00:01:54.120 --> 00:02:00.630
The more engaged your network is and the more in the
know they are, then the more likely you can tap into them
30

31
00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:01.170
The more engaged your network is and the more in the
know they are, then the more likely you can tap into them
31

32
00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:07.380
inevitably when you need them - for product
feedback, for hiring references, for really anything.
32

33
00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.970
They are essentially your lifeline.
33

34
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.420
Don't expect to get super huge without their support.
34

35
00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.180
Honestly, it doesn't really happen.
35

36
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.350
So get with it.
36

37
00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:20.490
You have a network and you can and should use them
at this stage of the process. What's that, you say?
37

38
00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.860
You say you don't have a network.
38

39
00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.590
Are you a shut-in?
39

40
00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.170
Are you one of those mole rat things
that grow up blind underneath the earth?
40

41
00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.610
Oh my God, so gross.
41

42
00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:31.030
Yes.
42

43
00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.680
Even mother nature's imitation
of Steve Buscemi has a network.
43

44
00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:40.830
If you have talked to someone who knows you by name,
and you know them by name, and you have each other's
44

45
00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:46.710
email address, well, then you have a network. That girl
you met on Tinder who wouldn't give you her phone
45

46
00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:49.230
number, but insisted on e-mail, she's in your network.
46

47
00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.130
number, but insisted on e-mail, she's in your network.
47

48
00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.360
OK.
48

49
00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:56.160
Now, depending on who you are, you can have anywhere
between 30 people or 300 people that you could e-mail
49

50
00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.040
right now. Regardless of the size, it's a great start.
50

51
00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.120
right now. Regardless of the size, it's a great start.
51

52
00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:07.440
Now, on a bare, bare minimum, we want to contact at
least 10 of these people, and anything below 10 is, well,
52

53
00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.100
kind of a waste of time.
53

54
00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.560
So if you wanted to go about doing this, contacting your
network, do you just open up your e-mail and start
54

55
00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.270
blasting things over here and over there like a supersoaker?
55

56
00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.340
Well, you can probably guess it.
56

57
00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:19.850
No, no, you do not.
57

58
00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.470
There is a process to do this, and that's
what we're going to cover right now.
58

59
00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.310
There is a process to do this, and that's
what we're going to cover right now.
59

60
00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.280
All right, so step number one.
60

61
00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:31.050
I want you to take a pencil, open a doc, or write in your
artisanal camel leather book you bought in Brooklyn
61

62
00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.470
for $200, and write out everyone in the last six months
62

63
00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.460
you remember contacting through e-mail.
63

64
00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.640
Try your best to remember everyone you can.
64

65
00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.880
You can even go back to your mail and then
just go through the Sent folder and scroll.
65

66
00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.400
How many people have you sent
an e-mail to? When you get a name,
66

67
00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:55.380
ask yourself this question. "If I e-mailed this person
about anything, would they for sure respond or at
67

68
00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:00.570
a minimum do I know they'll read the e-mail?" If you
can say yes to that question, then take their name
68

69
00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.060
and then put them down your list.
69

70
00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:07.420
If you honestly can't say yes to
that, then don't, just leave them out.
70

71
00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:11.170
It's not really worth trying this technique with them.
71

72
00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:16.830
Now, step two, now that you have your list, you want to
do one more pass at collecting people. One common
72

73
00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:24.390
mistake people make is that they e-mail everyone, and I
mean everyone. That sales rep you scheduled a webinar
73

74
00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.890
with, they don't want to hear your pitch.
74

75
00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:31.800
And that is really just a waste of precious computer bytes.
To figure out whether you should even be messaging them,
75

76
00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:32.990
And that is really just a waste of precious computer bytes.
To figure out whether you should even be messaging them,
76

77
00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.550
ask these three quick questions.
77

78
00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.120
How long has it been since you've
been in contact with them?
78

79
00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:45.630
If it's over a year, maybe you don't want to use that
person. You're not fresh on their mind and, well,
79

80
00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:47.860
they're not really fresh on yours.
80

81
00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:51.960
Another question to ask is, are they
relevant to your business or product?
81

82
00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:57.450
Chances are, when you created your project, you were
trying to solve someone's pain. Wouldn't be a huge
82

83
00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:03.580
coincidence if someone you knew had that pain. So if
they have some sort of connection, past or present,
83

84
00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.820
to what you're selling, then they could possibly be relevant.
84

85
00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:11.460
And then lastly, are they the type of person
that is generally open to helping people?
85

86
00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:17.110
In most cases, people are, but there are specific people out there
who just don't, and those people know exactly who they are.
86

87
00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:18.630
In most cases, people are, but there are specific people out there
who just don't, and those people know exactly who they are.
87

88
00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:24.180
Like Steve, or you, Eric. If the contact with the
person was too long ago, then just scratch them off.
88

89
00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:29.190
And if they're not even relevant in the slightest to
what you're trying to do, then also scratch them off.
89

90
00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:33.040
And lastly, are they a mean person? Also scratch them off.
90

91
00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:36.090
All right, now we have our pristine list of targets.
91

92
00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.300
We got rid of the contacts
92

93
00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:42.180
we would just blow it with anyway, and now we're
focusing on the ones that can help us, at least for now.
93

94
00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:45.530
This is, as I know it, the most
efficient way of using your network.
94

95
00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:45.960
OK.
95

96
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.700
So sit back and admire your list, and in the next
lecture, we're going to start spamming that list.
96

97
00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:52.920
I'm kidding, but not really.
97

98
00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:53.560
I'm kidding, but not really.
98

99
00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:53.820
All right.
99

100
00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:54.580
See you in the next lecture.
