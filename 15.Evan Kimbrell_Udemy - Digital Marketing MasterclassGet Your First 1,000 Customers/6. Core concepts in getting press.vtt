00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:01.800
All right, guys, welcome back.
1

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.920
We've been talking about PR in this 
section and the current state of press,
2

3
00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.760
what a reporter's day is like and how people use 
pitches to get coverage instead of writing moldy
3

4
00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:13.100
old press releases that you just push 
out and hope someone picks up on.
4

5
00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.840
I'm going to cover four steps on how you find,
research, contact, and then write effective pitches for
5

6
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.290
those reporters that you want to target.
6

7
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.980
But first I want to give you a little more background 
on some core PR and press concepts.
7

8
00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.840
Armed with these concepts, hopefully you will not run 
into any situations where you don't know what they're
8

9
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.790
talking about - * What the hell are you 
talking about? * - or you just make a flub bub.
9

10
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.260
Now, in this lecture, I'm going to talk about the concept 
of laddering up, the concept of press embargoes,
10

11
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.980
and what the term on spec means, three concepts 
that are absolutely crucial to be successful. If you
11

12
00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.130
skip this lecture and then you are unsuccessful,
12

13
00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:48.170
I'm not surprised.
13

14
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.440
OK.
14

15
00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.810
So, for the first concept, let's talk about laddering up.
15

16
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.190
Well, the fact of the matter is this. You're not going to 
get covered by the New York Times right off the bat
16

17
00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:56.580
Well, the fact of the matter is this. You're not going to 
get covered by the New York Times right off the bat
17

18
00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.180
once you start your press efforts. Why is it?
18

19
00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:05.850
Well, the New York Times covers really big stories,
really important stories, and they're kind of the top
19

20
00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:06.740
of the food chain.
20

21
00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.930
Now, if your goal is to develop bigger coverage 
over time, well, you need to build up your appeal.
21

22
00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.870
Now, the way you do this is by laddering up.
22

23
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:21.870
Now, this can be done by getting coverage in smaller,
less popular blogs, then using that success as validation
23

24
00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:25.380
to promote and pitch yourself to
the next level, then the next level,
24

25
00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:30.480
then the next level. As it turns out, all press outlets 
out there are kind of in a tier system, you have
25

26
00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:35.980
the lower level ones, then you have medium, then you
have higher, then you have these, like, epic ones that
26

27
00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.440
everyone wants to be in.
27

28
00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:44.610
As it turns out, it's kind of a hierarchy, so the ones 
at the very top look to the level below them for
28

29
00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.280
signals on good stories.
29

30
00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.670
They look below them,
30

31
00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.100
they look below them, all the way down to the bottom.
31

32
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:56.730
So what ends up happening is good stories get picked 
up by really scrappy blogs that don't have millions
32

33
00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:03.470
of visitors and have kind of the leeway to pick 
and choose what they really want to cover,
33

34
00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.710
they cover it, then it gets picked up, then 
it gets picked up, and it travels up the chain.
34

35
00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.270
Now, this method is pretty commonly used by startups to
get press coverage, and this is what we call it - laddering up.
35

36
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.700
Now, this method is pretty commonly used by startups to
get press coverage, and this is what we call it - laddering up.
36

37
00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.800
It's also called trading up.
37

38
00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:20.670
If you guys ever read Ryan Holiday's book, it's about getting 
press, he calls it trading up, but laddering up, trading
38

39
00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.230
up, pretty much the same concept. Start low,
39

40
00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:29.190
then you parlay your success with the easy to get 
into ones to go to the next ones, to go to the next
40

41
00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.110
ones, to go to the next ones, and then eventually you get 
into the New York Times, because you got into one that's
41

42
00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.870
well-read, but it's not as well-read as that one.
42

43
00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.010
Now, imagine if you were building a building where the 
ground floor is full of aspiring writers and bloggers,
43

44
00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.460
people who want to write about the 
industry, make a name for themselves,
44

45
00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.290
build a following, perhaps write for a media site one day.
45

46
00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.510
There's a lot of those people out there 
and they're hungry for ideas.
46

47
00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.550
For example, maybe you're a New Jersey based app 
developer and you have an app that you're trying to
47

48
00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:58.200
promote. Local bloggers and news sites are always 
interested in local stories, especially since bigger
48

49
00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.710
outlets might miss them or just flat out ignore them.
49

50
00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.670
So you could reach out to a place
like the New Jersey Tech Weekly.
50

51
00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:05.000
So you could reach out to a place
like the New Jersey Tech Weekly.
51

52
00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:10.470
They focus on New Jersey related tech news, so their 
following isn't huge, but it's very narrow and it's a start.
52

53
00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:11.010
They focus on New Jersey related tech news, so their 
following isn't huge, but it's very narrow and it's a start.
53

54
00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.150
So if you find an outlet that looks promising, 
you might think about pitching yourself to them.
54

55
00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.430
The number of pitches an outlet like this would get 
on a daily basis are much, much lower than a big
55

56
00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.050
industry site for sure.
56

57
00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:26.370
So you have a better chance of being considered and 
getting to know them, and in fact pitch doesn't have
57

58
00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:27.680
to be as good.
58

59
00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.740
You can kind of polish it and refine it
as you move up the chain.
59

60
00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.220
Once you get published a few times this way, then you 
can just parlay that success into something bigger.
60

61
00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:36.470
Now imagine that building again,
61

62
00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.280
but now you take the elevator up one floor, climb 
a ladder, I guess, this is laddering up after all,
62

63
00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.030
and on the next floor it's less crowded,
63

64
00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:47.880
but these mid-level writers have achieved some success of
their own, writing for more successful blogs or media sites.
64

65
00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:48.720
but these mid-level writers have achieved some success of
their own, writing for more successful blogs or media sites.
65

66
00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:54.480
They're still pretty narrow and niche, but we're now talking
about audiences that are an order of magnitude larger.
66

67
00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:55.300
They're still pretty narrow and niche, but we're now talking
about audiences that are an order of magnitude larger.
67

68
00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.420
These reporters are also looking for ideas, 
but their taste is a bit more selective.
68

69
00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.970
They get more pitches than the lower guys, but you 
can bet a lot of the pitches are from first timers
69

70
00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:07.200
hoping to get noticed. You, on the other hand,
have achieved success already, so mention it.
70

71
00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.850
Pitch your idea and let these mid-tier writers know 
you've got covered in these various sites already.
71

72
00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:13.790
That is the validation people want.
72

73
00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:17.160
Reporters can't immediately tell 
if this is a newsworthy story,
73

74
00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.750
so a lot of times you say, "Hey, look these people 
already said it was newsworthy," and you can even say
74

75
00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.160
how many times this got shared or something like that.
75

76
00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.610
That is very effective.
76

77
00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:30.150
With each successful pitch then you can add that to 
your arsenal of references to mention the next time
77

78
00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:31.140
you pitch yourself.
78

79
00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:35.070
Eventually, you can take a crack at the top four big 
players in your industry, whether they're, I don't
79

80
00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:40.580
know, if you're in tech it's probably Tech Crunch or
Mashable or whoever, and then you can go even on
80

81
00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:45.450
to the more national outlets like The Wall
Street Journal, or the BBC, or whatever.
81

82
00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.980
Develop your own success and use it 
to promote yourself on the next level.
82

83
00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.290
OK.
83

84
00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:53.810
So that's the concept of laddering up, and it's 
a process you can use to find some success.
84

85
00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:59.310
And in general, if you want to really get the most out of press, 
you should take this in mind, start low and then trade up.
85

86
00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:00.530
And in general, if you want to really get the most out of press, 
you should take this in mind, start low and then trade up.
86

87
00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:04.670
Another concept worth understanding is something 
that you'll hear occasionally and it's something
87

88
00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:08.110
that in the heat of things someone might 
ask you about and it might throw you off.
88

89
00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:14.510
That's called an embargo. Now, an embargo is a concept that is 
a little more into the realm of intermediate PR or advanced PR.
89

90
00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:15.850
That's called an embargo. Now, an embargo is a concept that is 
a little more into the realm of intermediate PR or advanced PR.
90

91
00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:19.910
Basically, what it means is when you're doing something 
that's timely or you're announcing something
91

92
00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:24.590
that's going to launch soon or on a specific date, what
you can often do is execute an embargo and that
92

93
00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:29.090
means you tell outlets and press and blogs,
93

94
00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:29.930
"This is when it launches. Please 
do not cover it until this time."
94

95
00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:32.390
"This is when it launches. Please 
do not cover it until this time."
95

96
00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:38.060
Now, the benefit of doing that is that it allows you 
to get more coverage potentially because if you
96

97
00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:43.010
tell six different places, "Hey, this launches on this date, you 
can only cover it on this date, please don't say before that,"
97

98
00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:44.780
tell six different places, "Hey, this launches on this date, you 
can only cover it on this date, please don't say before that,"
98

99
00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:50.420
well, then it's much easier for everyone to then organize
around it, know that "On this date we have to put it
99

100
00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:51.830
on our schedule to publish it."
100

101
00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.140
Otherwise, what ends up happening is you pitch one,
101

102
00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:59.300
they release it, then you pitch the next one, and
they say, "Hey, someone already covered it."
102

103
00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:04.010
So with an embargo they all kind of pitch it at the same 
time, so they don't have that problem of looking
103

104
00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:06.450
over their shoulder and saying, "Well, I'm not original, am I?"
104

105
00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.060
So that's a concept worth looking at.
105

106
00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:12.610
I know a lot of press people like writers don't
like embargoes, because well, think about it.
106

107
00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:15.040
It makes their day a lot harder.
107

108
00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:19.250
They have a really hard day anyway, but now they also 
have to think about when they can publish something,
108

109
00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:24.320
and also drives editors kind of crazy, because it goes 
against their instincts. They want to find a scoop,
109

110
00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:28.850
and then they want to publish it, and they want 
to be the one that's got there first, basically,
110

111
00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:31.700
put their flag onto the top of the mountain first.
111

112
00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:35.590
And that kind of leads me to a very 
related concept, and that's an exclusive.
112

113
00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:39.680
Now, this would be the opposite basically of doing an 
embargo, where an exclusive, what you do is you'd
113

114
00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:42.630
pitch to one outlet and say, "This is my story,
114

115
00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:44.680
I'm offering you an exclusive if you want to do it,
115

116
00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:46.390
I haven't told anyone else about it."
116

117
00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:51.950
What that means is, to them, if they choose to do it,
well, then they're the only one that's going to get
117

118
00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:56.770
this specific story, that's really 
valuable to writers and reporters.
118

119
00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:04.100
Now, typically exclusives are something you're going 
to probably try to execute on if, for instance, you're
119

120
00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:09.020
pitching to people and you're getting lukewarm 
reactions from like four or five different outlets.
120

121
00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:09.290
pitching to people and you're getting lukewarm 
reactions from like four or five different outlets.
121

122
00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:13.520
They're kind of interested, but not 
enough interest to pull the trigger.
122

123
00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:19.400
What you can do in those cases is instead pick one,
offer an exclusive, and generally speaking, that
123

124
00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:23.720
makes it more of an enticing offer to them,
makes it more likely that they'll cover it.
124

125
00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:26.810
If they say no, you just move to the next one,
move to the next one, move to the next one.
125

126
00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:31.030
So it's a question of, do you pitch five 
hoping that one of them covers you,
126

127
00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:34.200
or do you pitch one knowing there's
a good chance they cover you?
127

128
00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:39.200
Exclusives are kind of an example where you're not 
maximizing the press you're getting, you're guaranteeing
128

129
00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:44.240
that you get something. Embargoes, on the other hand,
you're kind of gambling the opposite, you're gambling
129

130
00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:50.390
that lots of people will cover you, especially if I let 
everybody know this is the start line for the race.
130

131
00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:50.930
that lots of people will cover you, especially if I let 
everybody know this is the start line for the race.
131

132
00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:54.760
Now, the last concept I want to explain
is the concept of on spec writing.
132

133
00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:56.610
Remember that we said that reporters are lazy?
133

134
00:07:56.630 --> 00:07:58.780
Well, they're really, really, really busy.
134

135
00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:00.880
And hey, it's really not their fault.
135

136
00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:03.800
Anything they can make their lives 
and jobs easier is welcomed.
136

137
00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:06.920
Well, what if instead of pitching 
them a great idea about you,
137

138
00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:09.350
what if you wrote the entire article for them?
138

139
00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:10.660
I know, it sounds crazy.
139

140
00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:15.650
There's actually a term for this kind of writing 
and it's called on spec writing. On spec is short for
140

141
00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:21.740
on speculation, because you're hoping that this article
fits what they're looking for and then you can
141

142
00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:23.010
actually put it in their
142

143
00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:27.980
publication. Now, the concept kind 
of fits into a spectrum out there.
143

144
00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:32.960
Some outlets don't have enough to write about and 
so their standards for what they'll accept is going
144

145
00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:36.630
to be lower. I mean standards as in you 
don't have to do as much work for them.
145

146
00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:42.350
Those people might accept an idea, like an explanation
pitch, or they might even accept a headline pitch.
146

147
00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:44.040
You don't necessarily have to write it for them. Now,
147

148
00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:49.400
ones that are more busy, more demanding,
and they have a higher kind of bar to entry,
148

149
00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:54.290
those ones often will expect on spec writing,
unless you've written for them before.
149

150
00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:54.800
Why?
150

151
00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:57.050
Because, well, they have never heard of you before and
151

152
00:08:57.050 --> 00:08:58.220
you just pitch them a headline.
152

153
00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:00.410
Are they really going to spend time working with you,
153

154
00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:04.970
reading through it, and editing it if they have no idea
if you're going to be worth their time? They have
154

155
00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:07.540
to deal with a lot of people, hundreds of people.
155

156
00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:13.610
So a lot of them will just expect on spec stuff if you're 
brand new, and in some cases, some outlets will
156

157
00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:16.580
just flat out only accept on spec.
157

158
00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:18.500
Really it's just a way to save them time,
158

159
00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:23.750
and if they have more pitches than they can cover,
well, then they have the leverage to do that.
159

160
00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:28.850
Now, of course, the flip side is occasionally you find 
writers who don't want you to write on spec specifically,
160

161
00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:35.390
and I think that's more because they find it more 
work to change the spec writing to fit their own or
161

162
00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:37.520
it takes too long to even read through it,
162

163
00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:39.980
but that's usually the minority.
163

164
00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:42.560
So this is something that you're going 
to have to think about going forward.
164

165
00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:47.240
It's something that is kind of a lever you can pull 
if you're not having success with something. If you're
165

166
00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:49.700
pitching people and you're not 
getting a response, oftentimes
166

167
00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:56.660
you can go down to less selective, less kind of distributed 
outlets, and that means you'll be competing with fewer people.
167

168
00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:57.540
you can go down to less selective, less kind of distributed 
outlets, and that means you'll be competing with fewer people.
168

169
00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:02.140
Now, that's one way of doing it, but also another way of 
doing it is to spend more time upfront on your own
169

170
00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:03.170
writing the articles.
170

171
00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:06.010
Sometimes you can write an outline 
for them and that's good enough.
171

172
00:10:06.010 --> 00:10:09.000
Sometimes you have to go full on spec 
and write the whole thing for them.
172

173
00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:13.630
Now, it does sound like "Oh wow, it's an enormous 
amount of work to write all these articles to pitch them and
173

174
00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:15.530
just throw them away when no one accepts them."
174

175
00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:16.010
Well, what you can do is focus all your efforts on writing 
one really good one, and then pitch that out, and
175

176
00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:21.150
Well, what you can do is focus all your efforts on writing 
one really good one, and then pitch that out, and
176

177
00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:25.840
if they say no, then either retool it 
or just repitch it to the next outlet.
177

178
00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:31.780
There's enough outlets out there that cover the same 
stuff that you can very often use the same article
178

179
00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:35.880
for five or six or seven different 
places until it gets picked up.
179

180
00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:38.260
All right, anyway, so those are three crucial concepts.
180

181
00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.150
We have the laddering up, also called trading up,
181

182
00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:47.740
we have embargoes and exclusives, and then we have 
writing on spec or on speculation articles upfront to help
182

183
00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:49.220
increase the chances of getting covered.
183

184
00:10:49.270 --> 00:10:50.200
Makes sense? No?
184

185
00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:51.280
Well, not surprised. This is probably brand new. Anyway,
185

186
00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:52.690
Well, not surprised. This is probably brand new. Anyway,
186

187
00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:57.890
well, now we're going to go into the first of the four
steps that I mentioned earlier for finding, researching,
187

188
00:10:57.890 --> 00:11:01.090
contacting, and pitching the reporters 
that you want to reach so badly.
188

189
00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:03.630
We'll start that discussion in our next lecture.
189

190
00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:04.040
See you then.
