Hey guys welcome back.

2
00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.290
So far we've discussed the common types of videos you might create and the reasons you'd use video to

3
00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:08.790
accomplish marketing goals.

4
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.800
If you're considering creating videos then you should know that creating them is in many ways just like

5
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.830
creating other stuff like a blog post or like an info graphic.

6
00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.440
There's usually can be three phases of development you go through if you for anything you create.

7
00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:25.530
Now the first step is usually preparation or research a second step you begin actually building the

8
00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.490
piece whatever it is and then the last after you fine tune your work for you publish it.

9
00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.400
Now video projects are just like that.

10
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.370
But one big difference is that video requires some additional skills and technology.

11
00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.250
Let them say first phase of a video project is known as pre-production and that's the preparation and

12
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.030
research stage you assemble all the pieces you'll need to create the video.

13
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.800
Like writing the script and the storyboard you'll figure out what locations you want to shoot and maybe

14
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.540
it's multiple Maybe it's just one.

15
00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:53.380
What equipment you're going to use.

16
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:58.800
You also identify people who might be in your video and the people who will help behind the scenes.

17
00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:03.770
So a lot of what happens in pre-production involves making arrangements and preparing for the next phase.

18
00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.940
Now second phase of any video project is what we call production.

19
00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.980
That's when you actually create the piece of your video.

20
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.100
When you produce it you'll use your camera to shoot the footage or your webcam.

21
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.330
You're going to set up lights to make it look nice and hopefully use microphones so people who can hear

22
00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.110
you without it sounding like crown of morals.

23
00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.440
All that prep you did in pre-production will hopefully make the production phase is painless as possible.

24
00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.640
So then the third and final phase of a video project is going to be called the you can probably guess

25
00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.940
that the post-production super original.

26
00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.940
This is the part where you take everything you created in production and put it all together into a

27
00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.110
finished piece.

28
00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.330
You'll use editing software to cut the video together.

29
00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:47.940
You'll make sure everything looks and sounds good and you'll add any additional facts like words or

30
00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.750
graphics on the screen or explosion.

31
00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:57.100
Now if you're still unsure about what some of those things I talked about are that's fine because in

32
00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.630
the next series of lectures we're going to walk through each phase of the video production process and

33
00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.320
discuss everything you need to know.

34
00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.330
We'll talk about options for different apps you can use to create all the pieces you need for video

35
00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.920
and how to work within whatever budget you have in mind.

36
00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.920
So if you're ready to dive in her let's move on to the next lecture.
