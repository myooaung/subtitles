00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.240
Hagar is welcome your back we're all back.

2
00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:04.110
We're OK with it.

3
00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.240
And speaking of coming back I want to revisit something we talked about earlier because now as we're

4
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.540
thinking about developing ideas and videos.

5
00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:13.010
Well it's a good time for it.

6
00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:18.990
Over those different types of videos and the first part of our video marketing section really wasn't

7
00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.900
that long ago it mentioned six different types of videos that you could create ads explainer videos

8
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.490
product demos customer testimonials warfare videos and F.A. cues.

9
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.150
Now those are the only videos you can make in the world.

10
00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.200
But those are six very common easy formats to tackle.

11
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.290
Now one thing we covered when we talked about this before was that the different kinds can they can

12
00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:46.140
have different links different runtime to the videos as are usually very short of short attention spans

13
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:46.620
for ads.

14
00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.080
We also hate ads so you have to make it short walk through on the other hand could be very very long.

15
00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.930
Someone is going to watch one of those is probably dedicated to figuring out how to do whatever it is

16
00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.370
that they were originally searching for.

17
00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.650
Another thing is that the focus of each of these six videos is also a little bit different explainers

18
00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.410
focus on explaining one important concept product demos and walkthrough.

19
00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:14.400
They range from simple to very detailed and AFAIK use can be laser focused no matter what you're trying

20
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.170
to present.

21
00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.220
There is probably a type of video for you but when you consider that these videos are part of a marketing

22
00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.380
process you also have to think about the goals they're trying to accomplish when you create those videos.

23
00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.200
Now before we talked a little bit about how you can have different goals for each video and kind of

24
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:37.650
took it from a micro level where we said well if you're looking for conversions Here's what you need

25
00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.380
to do inside your video.

26
00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.750
If you're looking for brand awareness and shares this is what you need to do inside.

27
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:44.550
But there's leisure.

28
00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:50.660
We're going to talk about how you can see each type of video in a different light.

29
00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:56.640
And the way you look at it we mentioned this slightly before is by looking at each type of video as

30
00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.010
correlating exactly to one specific part in your marketing funnel.

31
00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:07.330
Now I don't know every member of this before but we cover marketing funnels the concept of a funnel.

32
00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.900
In general we like to think of things as funnels and marketing because that way we can segment them

33
00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:19.140
into sections person sees my ad person clicks my ad person comes to my page person goes to my shopping

34
00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.750
cart person buys.

35
00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.120
We segment those out.

36
00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.940
And then therefore we can see what's working and what's not.

37
00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.760
Now Video Marketing works almost in an identical way.

38
00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:35.100
Usually we're going to have a certain type of video when the person has never heard of us before.

39
00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.930
And we need to bring the company to their awareness.

40
00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:45.570
Then we have videos that convince them or generate interest then we have videos that convert them once

41
00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:50.250
they've already established that they're interested and then we have videos that help them appreciate

42
00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.940
the product.

43
00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.610
So think about two types of videos.

44
00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.510
We have the ads the explainer videos.

45
00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:00.480
Now those two types of videos are good ones for reaching people early on in your relationship with them.

46
00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:07.230
People don't know you yet or they might soon become aware of you through ads past that point.

47
00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.040
Well they might finally understand what you do.

48
00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.200
Or one specific feature of what you do through an explainer video.

49
00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.150
So in other words explainers and ads make for good.

50
00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.020
Top of the funnel content.

51
00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:23.850
Now if I were looking at a funnel in memory remember this before the top of the funnel wine in the bottom

52
00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.820
of the funnel is then the top of the funnels we're talking about.

53
00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:32.340
When you have a large group of people that usually become aware of your product and then as they move

54
00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.450
down fewer and fewer people make it to the next step the ones make it through the funnel.

55
00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.110
Are the people that give you their sweet sweet gold generally speaking.

56
00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:46.560
We look at funnels as at least three different phases Sometimes you'll see five or six but in general

57
00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.440
all marketers agree that there's at least three phases.

58
00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.810
And by focusing on each phase we can deliver different content and that allows us to push people through

59
00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:55.130
it.

60
00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.590
Like I said before the top of the funnel is what we call the awareness stage.

61
00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:03.660
Now some might call it the learning stage when people are trying to find a solution to a problem they

62
00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:04.150
have.

63
00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.430
They're in search mode just beginning to gather info.

64
00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:12.390
In other words they're just becoming aware of their needs and learning about the possible solutions

65
00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.930
out there.

66
00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.730
The middle of the funnel is called the consideration phage which some people also call the evaluation

67
00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:19.890
stage when people have collected info.

68
00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:25.470
They sort of narrowing down their choices to solve their problem and now they're evaluating the individual

69
00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.550
options like the name says this is where they consider their choices.

70
00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:35.250
Now the bottom of the funnel is the decision stage when you guessed it there are ultimately about to

71
00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:41.100
make their decision but not before doing final research maybe personally talking to people asking for

72
00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.320
furloughs because you're whatever choice they're about to make is the right one.

73
00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:50.130
So this is also why some people call this the justification stage where you justify whatever Stygian

74
00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:51.390
you're about to make.

75
00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:56.730
So that's the marketing funnel from top to bottom awareness consideration and then decision are ads

76
00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:00.780
and explainer videos absolutely live at that top of the funnel where people who are still trying to

77
00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:06.630
figure out who we are and what we do and build awareness to get our name out there or explainers will

78
00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:12.450
demonstrate our abilities and hopefully solidifying us as an option that customers will consider moving

79
00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:13.030
on.

80
00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:16.760
It's kind of in the I would say it's in the top middle section.

81
00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:17.700
Does it all makes sense.

82
00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:21.280
Not all marketing concepts are completely crystal clear.

83
00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:26.160
All right so the saying goes a step further down the funnel in the middle stage the consideration stage

84
00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.170
where people are narrowing down their options.

85
00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:31.870
You need to deliver on whatever promises you made in the awareness stage.

86
00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:36.930
So if you're as promised a product that was easy to use and some product demos could be used to prove

87
00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:41.940
that hey it's easy to use or at a minimum have tax that repeats that if customers are looking for more

88
00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:46.290
evidence that your product is worth considering customer testimonial videos are great for showing the

89
00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:51.810
success people have had with your product or service product demos and testimony videos make for a great

90
00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:56.520
middle of the funnel content when people are evaluating options and looking for evidence to help them

91
00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:57.590
reach their decision.

92
00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:58.140
It's not good.

93
00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:05.700
Top of the funnel content because someone's never heard of your service and they saw a video with one

94
00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:11.400
person talking about a problem they had and how a software solved it or whatever your product is out

95
00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.350
of context it really would make any sense.

96
00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:17.250
And then finally at the last stage of the funnel the decision stage you're looking to help customers

97
00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:18.510
justify their choice.

98
00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:21.670
So a walk through video could be a good option here.

99
00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:27.180
A longer more detailed look at your product might be the thing people need to finally get them to choose

100
00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:28.000
something.

101
00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:30.840
It's not unlike taking a test drive when you're considering a car.

102
00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:35.550
You don't test drive something as soon as you see it but after you've narrowed down some choices and

103
00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:39.530
you are ready to see how this thing handles maybe you can try it out for yourself.

104
00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:44.150
So walk through videos offer a similar kind of look at the product.

105
00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:50.290
You also sometimes see walkthrough as later on for people who've already bought the product.

106
00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:54.550
But still people find their way to the walkthrough as before they buy.

107
00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:59.040
And I think videos can be especially good at justifying a purchase specially if you create a series

108
00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:01.510
of them for new customers like getting started.

109
00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:06.180
The video would help explain how to solve a common problem by all means create it and make it available

110
00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:07.490
in an obvious place.

111
00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:12.930
The fact we have a series of fake videos available is a great selling point showing you're interested

112
00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:16.650
in supporting your customers before and after they make a purchase.

113
00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:22.230
So you can see from talking through these three phases of the marketing funnel that will all these videotapes

114
00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:27.480
whose stuff can be good ones they might be most effective at different times in your relationship with

115
00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:28.360
the customer.

116
00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:33.030
If you can get a variety of videos and make sure customers and each of the three phases have enough

117
00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:38.040
content to satisfy their needs they'll be well supported throughout the entire process and it'll help

118
00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:39.510
you reach your goals.

119
00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:45.030
Another thing worth saying is that in some cases where you've already built up some kind of content

120
00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:51.600
on your web site maybe you've already started to explore ads you can use this marketing funnel and video

121
00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:54.920
marketing concept to do almost spot treatment.

122
00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:59.730
What I mean by that is let's say you have ads and let's say you have enough awareness you have 100 people

123
00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:06.210
coming to your site day but you just notice that people are stuck in the consideration phase.

124
00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:10.170
Well if you just notice that not a lot of people are converting or getting to the point where they're

125
00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:16.360
very serious about purchasing it going to your car going to the actual pricing pages things like that.

126
00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:21.840
Well you might focus on some of that middle of the funnel stuff get some customer testimonial videos

127
00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:23.990
up those could be a clincher.

128
00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:27.900
Similarly if maybe your ads just aren't generating enough awareness.

129
00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:29.640
But everything else seems to be working fine.

130
00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:35.220
Well perhaps you can inject just a little video into making your ads be more successful.

131
00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:39.390
OK guys it's an important concept that I wanted to make sure you guys could see how it lines up and

132
00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:45.160
why different types of videos are just use at different points and for different reasons.

133
00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:46.610
All right guys I'll see you in the next lecture.
