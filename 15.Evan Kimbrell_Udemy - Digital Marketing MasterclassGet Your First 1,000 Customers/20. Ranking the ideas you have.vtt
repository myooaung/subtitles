00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:02.480
Hey guys welcome back to the Corps.

2
00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:02.820
OK.

3
00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.160
So we just spent a whole lot of time searching for ideas through Google and through read it went through

4
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.290
Corra cetera et cetera.

5
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.180
Now if you really put in that time to find content and look for ideas that's awesome congratulations

6
00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:16.930
it's really going to help you out.

7
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:22.680
But I'm sure as you listing out these ideas you're probably wondering or hearing a voice in the back

8
00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.290
of your head saying how am I going to make sense of all this stuff when I'm done looking for ideas how

9
00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:30.710
do I know which of these are the best.

10
00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:32.990
Well I'll tell you what I do.

11
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.700
It's something many other writers and bloggers do as well.

12
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:42.210
Now as you record these ideas and one more thing to each item to help you figure out which items or

13
00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.670
which ideas should get covered first what that is a very basic ranking system.

14
00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.970
Now we've got ranking systems all around us.

15
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.420
We have letter grades from Ada for number grades from 0 to 100.

16
00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.850
We've got five star ratings on Amazon.

17
00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.160
There's thumbs up versus thumbs down.

18
00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.140
So when I say ranking system that's really all I mean.

19
00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.250
But now how exactly can we apply that to our content ideas.

20
00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.210
Well our best ideas should be bring higher than the not as good ones.

21
00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:11.780
Right.

22
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.850
And if we could see that at a glance on our content ideas spreadsheet or even better if we could sort

23
00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.740
by that ranking and see what appears at the top then well we'll know which ideas on our big list are

24
00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.820
the best ones and probably the next ones we should start working on.

25
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:27.350
OK.

26
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:28.790
Since this is a great idea.

27
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:29.640
Thank you very much.

28
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.090
Let's figure out a ranking system that you can use for your list.

29
00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.240
What are some ways we can evaluate our content ideas.

30
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.120
Well here is something that we can start with.

31
00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:45.690
First thing I want to start with is a rating of relevance relevance meaning would our audience care

32
00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.060
about this specific idea.

33
00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:54.390
Is there a need we can satisfy with it our readers and falles will only check something out if it's

34
00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.500
relevant for them.

35
00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.340
So which is it.

36
00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.140
Is it a yes.

37
00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.970
Is it a no or is it a maybe.

38
00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:07.020
Yes great keep that idea if it's a maybe well then maybe you need to think more about the idea or tweak

39
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.680
it a little bit to make it more relevant and tell it to solve it.

40
00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:15.750
Yes but if the answer is no Once you've actually sat down and kind of toiled on it you should probably

41
00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:21.780
remove that idea from your list or at least stain it with the red No so that later on you know not to

42
00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:22.330
touch it.

43
00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.760
Getting people to read stuff they're not interested in isn't worth your time or theirs.

44
00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.840
So basically this rating system is going to be there.

45
00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.850
Will they give a meter.

46
00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.650
For example if your audience is into say tricking out cars the power tools and the materials they can

47
00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:44.040
buy you might think of a blog post idea like how to trick out your car for under $500 and that would

48
00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.840
be on target but maybe your friend tells you this guy posted a video on YouTube about tricking out his

49
00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.470
1992 Volkswagen minivan.

50
00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.130
OK.

51
00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.090
And it's a pretty cool video so you wonder should I write about tricking out things besides just cars.

52
00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.510
OK.

53
00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:03.830
It might be worth it or it could be like that in-between zone and maybe now it just really depends.

54
00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.300
Is your focus on tricking out things that people ride.

55
00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:13.620
Or is it tricking out cars specifically what really comes down to you is what your audience is expecting.

56
00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.820
And if they're not expecting this well will they still be cool with it.

57
00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.800
Now here's one bonus to consider when you're thinking about relevance.

58
00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:25.010
If your audience likes this idea then maybe other blogs would like it as well.

59
00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:28.700
So some of these ideas can turn into guest posting opportunities.

60
00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:32.360
And this idea kind of reminds me of another way to evaluate your ideas.

61
00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.610
So in the next column What's the value in our ideas on originality.

62
00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:41.030
Now if you have a truly unique idea that your audience would be interested in that's great.

63
00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:48.210
Like maybe nobody with a tricking out cars type blog is talking about tricked out Volkswagens or other

64
00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:52.370
odd unique models so in that sense that's pretty original.

65
00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.350
Maybe it's worth writing about that then.

66
00:03:54.390 --> 00:04:00.330
But you know a lot of the ideas you come up with no matter what industry you're in have probably already

67
00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:06.570
been covered either entirely or at least partially in some way and that is perfectly fine it absolutely

68
00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:09.390
does not mean you shouldn't write about it.

69
00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:14.790
Part of evaluating ideas right here is to see if you have an original angle that you can bring to the

70
00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:15.350
topic.

71
00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.000
So consider your idea in that way.

72
00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.090
Do you have your own interesting angle that hasn't been done before.

73
00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:25.410
Fill it out just like the other one with yes no or maybe.

74
00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.670
Now if the answer is no well then you need to think about it.

75
00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.030
Why should you consider this idea.

76
00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.790
Is it because 10 other people have already written about it lately and you don't want to be left out

77
00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:40.490
or are you looking to bring in some web traffic and this topic seems like a safe one.

78
00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.790
Those are not bad reasons to write about something.

79
00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:49.290
But coming up with that original take on a topic will give your content a better chance of being memorable.

80
00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:56.130
At least ten other blogs may have written about the latest Google algorithm update but then you realize

81
00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:02.730
well maybe none of them have noted the benefits specific or let's say local business owners who have

82
00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:04.860
their businesses listed on Google.

83
00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:10.380
So even though you might cover some of the same ground you're giving it a perspective that others didn't

84
00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:11.320
focus on.

85
00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.530
And if there is an audience for it you'll get some readers out of it.

86
00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.230
There's another way to rank your ideas.

87
00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:18.630
I wanted to mention here and that's resources.

88
00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:23.220
Can you actually create the content based on this idea as in.

89
00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:29.370
Do you have the resources do you have the knowledge the experience the time the technical or creative

90
00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:31.140
skills to pull this off.

91
00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:35.640
Consider the subject matter now if you know as you backwards and forwards then you don't really need

92
00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:40.560
to consult with an expert to see if what you're writing about on the latest Google algorithm change

93
00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:41.920
is accurate or not.

94
00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:46.500
But if you want to write about a topic you don't know very well then you'll need to do more research

95
00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:51.330
maybe get it reviewed by someone else senior to think about whether or not you can really do it.

96
00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:57.150
If your idea is creating videos or Photoshopping something awesome or making a sweet infographics do

97
00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:02.440
you have the video editing or image creation and editing skills that you need to pull this off.

98
00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:07.920
If your idea is to produce say like a comprehensive Ultimate Guide style ebook about email marketing

99
00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:11.650
that social media geeks and other marketers would download well.

100
00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:15.980
Do you have the time to write that because ultimate guides take a lot of time.

101
00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:21.000
In other words can you afford to sync all of your time into that one huge project when you could be

102
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.680
producing a dozen blog posts instead.

103
00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:29.880
So ranking your idea under resources is really ranking how easily you could throw together this idea

104
00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:33.390
and a reasonable amount of time without any significant outside help.

105
00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:40.140
And maybe the measurement here isn't a yes no or maybe but more of a spot where you list exactly what

106
00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:41.500
you would need instead.

107
00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:47.700
Like need photoshop help or need expert review or if you're all good just put nothing needed.

108
00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:52.850
So for those first three items we can go in and add these fields right into our spreadsheet or whatever

109
00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:54.690
we've been using a tracker ideas.

110
00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:59.750
Remember that spreadsheet of ideas we came up with a while back or two or three years ago.

111
00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:02.310
Go right in and put in the columns for relevance.

112
00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:04.560
Originality and resources.

113
00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:06.990
Then you can add values for each idea.

114
00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:10.350
Yes no maybe you can do it from a scale to 1 to 10.

115
00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:15.150
Whatever way you want to score these things is up to you but I generally recommend keeping it simple

116
00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:19.600
because once you have 50 of these things it just gets muddled.

117
00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:22.760
Yes or no is the way I do it it's really easy to understand now.

118
00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:27.140
So far we've been ranking these ideas with our audience in mind and that's something you have to do

119
00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:29.120
because this content is for them.

120
00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:34.670
But we have to also consider our own needs and this gives us another way to rank each idea.

121
00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:38.760
I ask this question where will this idea help us accomplish our goals.

122
00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:43.620
If you're building a business or trying to sell a product you probably have goals and all this content

123
00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:46.310
you're creating should help you get to those goals.

124
00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:47.060
Right.

125
00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:51.160
So what is it youre trying to accomplish with all of this content.

126
00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:53.430
Are you trying to increase your sales of your product.

127
00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:56.080
Are you trying to get more downloads for your app.

128
00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:59.250
Do you just want people to follow you and read everything you post.

129
00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:03.900
Now these big goals you have should help guide the ideas you come up with and help you choose which

130
00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:05.300
ideas to develop.

131
00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:09.460
So when we get here to the part where we're evaluating our ideas.

132
00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:15.780
The question is will each idea help us accomplish those goals that we outlined previously and really

133
00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:17.630
which goals will they support.

134
00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:18.720
Specifically.

135
00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:21.840
Well let's say you're in the business of email marketing consulting.

136
00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:28.050
You know you design emails you know Chimp and Emma and all the other email tools you can get people

137
00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:29.220
started you can.

138
00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:31.520
I don't know give them advice and so on and so on.

139
00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:37.680
So maybe your big goal is to sell your consulting services and by blogging about related email topics

140
00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:43.830
you're hoping you can reach other topics like creating general awareness generating leads and signing

141
00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:45.350
up maybe some new clients.

142
00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:50.790
So hey one idea that comes to mind that might support those goals is to write a big ultimate guides

143
00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:56.190
style ebook about email marketing something people can reference download share with others and maybe

144
00:08:56.190 --> 00:09:01.530
by reading it they realize oh hey this guy or gal knows what they're talking about and maybe we should

145
00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:05.750
just hire him to build our e-mail strategy for us that works for me.

146
00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:11.100
So if we were keeping a spreadsheet of our ideas and this big ebook idea was on the list we could put

147
00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:15.790
in something under the goal column something like downloads or leads.

148
00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:18.720
That's what we're hoping to get from this piece of content.

149
00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:24.270
Now this is where it comes in handy as you're planning your content like in your calendar.

150
00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:29.240
You can look at these different goals to mix and match so you're always supporting your various goals.

151
00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:34.830
But I mean as you might have 10 great ideas that would be perfect for generating leads but if you already

152
00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:40.010
have let's say a lot of leads you can only process so many You're getting swamped with them.

153
00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:46.170
Maybe you don't have time for new business and you really should focus on creating content instead establishes

154
00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:50.610
credibility or help you convert sales or something like that.

155
00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:55.410
Well the next ideas you pick are ones meant to help you generate leads well then you're really not helping

156
00:09:55.410 --> 00:10:00.680
yourself if you know your goals for each piece of content you can pick the ones you want for a certain

157
00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:05.760
time or spread them all out so you've basically got a nice balance to what you're creating.

158
00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:07.560
All right so one more thing before I go.

159
00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:13.550
Let's say you start going through your list and you discover a lot of my ideas are not actually a good

160
00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:14.060
fit.

161
00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:16.870
In fact some aren't very original or relevant.
