Hey guys, welcome back to the course.
1

2
00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:08.190
So, in this group of lectures, I want to discuss platforms 
that some marketers refer to as emerging markets, and
2

3
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:11.820
what would be worth trying out in that group itself.
3

4
00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:14.280
Now, what exactly do I mean by an emerging market?
4

5
00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.400
Well, it's basically a platform that marketers
have not completely saturated yet.
5

6
00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:24.690
There's still room for someone like you to jump in
and get some form of results, and usually you can
6

7
00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:29.370
do it at a much higher ROI - less effort, more return.
7

8
00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:29.860
Why?
8

9
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.930
Well, because fewer people are
in the pool. Now, specifically here,
9

10
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.110
I want to talk about two emerging markets,
and that's Snapchat and Instagram.
10

11
00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.570
Now, you might be thinking, how are these two massive
platforms that I've heard of for years now still emerging?
11

12
00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:43.650
Now, you might be thinking, how are these two massive
platforms that I've heard of for years now still emerging?
12

13
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:44.820
Yes, I know you're right.
13

14
00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.180
Snapchat and Instagram are massive platforms,
14

15
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.220
but many marketers are still trying to figure out how 
exactly to use them to appeal to their audience.
15

16
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.920
What would you consider a mature market?
16

17
00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.080
Well, probably something like Google
Adwords or Facebook Marketing.
17

18
00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.330
Those have been around long enough that
their ad platforms are well-developed,
18

19
00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.070
they're well understood, and they're well utilized.
19

20
00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.780
Everybody knows how to use those. Snapchat, for instance,
20

21
00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.620
as we're speaking now, is still rolling out their
first iteration of their marketing platform.
21

22
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.130
Instagram, they're kind of incorporated into Facebook and
they're a little bit more mature, but people still have no
22

23
00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.930
idea how to market on there. Now, finding
success isn't always straightforward,
23

24
00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:29.190
so it helps to first understand the users on the platform
and why they use the platforms in the first place.
24

25
00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:30.120
so it helps to first understand the users on the platform
and why they use the platforms in the first place.
25

26
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:35.060
Now, both of those platforms, Snapchat and Instagram,
are essentially for posting videos and photos.
26

27
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:41.670
Snapchat has over 150 million daily users, mostly tweens, and 
Instagram now has a user base of something like 700 million.
27

28
00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.740
Snapchat has over 150 million daily users, mostly tweens, and 
Instagram now has a user base of something like 700 million.
28

29
00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.040
There is a pretty contentious rivalry between the two.
29

30
00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.830
In my opinion, Instagram is winning pretty easily.
Now, yes, I know, these are both massive,
30

31
00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.540
but there's one thing that's driving the emerging-ness
of these two platforms, and that's their demographics.
31

32
00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.010
Snapchat users are young,
32

33
00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.350
like I said, tweens, most of them like Twilight.
33

34
00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.680
Two thirds of its users are under 25 years old. Now,
34

35
00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.140
meanwhile, about 60% of Instagram users are under 30, 
with a third of its users in their 30s and 40s.
35

36
00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:10.750
meanwhile, about 60% of Instagram users are under 30, 
with a third of its users in their 30s and 40s.
36

37
00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.810
So Instagram is not as young as Snapchat,
but still there are plenty of younger users in it.
37

38
00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.740
So in that sense, its emerging in two different ways.
38

39
00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:23.550
It's emerging because these are younger, more 
impressionable consumers, especially the ones that didn't
39

40
00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.040
grow up with Facebook or the
platforms that we are all used to,
40

41
00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.150
and then also, they're just not saturated yet, their
ad platforms are not mature, therefore people are
41

42
00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.460
still trying to figure out what works,
42

43
00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.270
people on the platforms don't expect ads as much,
43

44
00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.720
therefore they're usually more susceptible to them.
44

45
00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.290
So which platform is worth trying?
45

46
00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:47.250
Well, both are actually promising if your business
caters to a younger audience and you're interested
46

47
00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.180
in trying some new ways to reach them.
47

48
00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:55.110
And then the second "if" is if your business could take 
advantage of a purely visual platform, where all you
48

49
00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.040
post are pictures and videos.
49

50
00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:02.220
Now, not every business out there can make videos
and photos work. Plumbing services are not going to
50

51
00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.130
have a lot of success, because 
what are you going to share?
51

52
00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:11.970
But if you're a health food store, yeah, you can show 
photos of your food in a beautiful pasture and then
52

53
00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:18.020
people being happy and healthy, that naturally 
lends itself to video and photo more easily.
53

54
00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.010
Now, it's obviously a spectrum.
54

55
00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:26.820
It's not yes or no, you can't do video/photos, but 
some are just going to be easier than others.
55

56
00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:32.380
I generally say try it out, unless you know for a fact 
that your audience just isn't on these platforms.
56

57
00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:33.180
Try it out.
57

58
00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.620
It doesn't take a lot of effort.
58

59
00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:40.320
That's why we have it in the "Get your 100" section,
because it doesn't take a lot to try this out
59

60
00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.080
and easily within a week or so you'll figure out if it's working.
60

61
00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:47.900
Now, if your audience skews older, like 40s and up, well, 
you might do better concentrating on other channels.
61

62
00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:52.600
And if you find it challenging to come up with visual 
ideas for the kind of marking that you want to do,
62

63
00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:57.610
maybe a channel that focuses on written posts and 
articles would probably be a little more appropriate.
63

64
00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.870
If you want to learn more about Snapchat and Instagram,
64

65
00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:03.510
well, we need to dive into each platform 
and get to know them a little bit better.
65

66
00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.410
We'll start in our next lecture with the 
younger of the two, snappy Snapchat.
66

67
00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:08.100
All right, see you then.
