1
00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:02.430
All right let's move on now.

2
00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:07.480
You all know about the dirty details of the resolution and aspect ratio what cameras might you use to

3
00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:09.980
actually record this footage we've talked about so much.

4
00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.590
Now there are really four main categories of video cameras out there.

5
00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.580
And one of them is professional grade don't really even worry about the high end stuff because I'm not

6
00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:19.430
going be covering it.

7
00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:23.600
And also those cameras can get insanely expensive.

8
00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.410
There's cameras that are $60000.

9
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:36.010
So even cameras that are like semi amateur semi pro like the red line cameras are around like 15 grand

10
00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.280
and that's just not worth it unless you're a professional video company.

11
00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:44.220
I'm going to talk about the three categories that most people can afford and get good results with.

12
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.700
Now those are going to be smartphones.

13
00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:52.300
Then we have consumer cameras and then we have prosumer cameras which are kind of like a step below

14
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.510
pro cameras but they cost a ton.

15
00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.410
A lot of people call them prosumer.

16
00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.420
Basically you're an amateur but you take it a lot more seriously.

17
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:01.100
OK let's first talk about smartphones.

18
00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.520
Yes.

19
00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.970
You can use your iPhone or Samsung or whatever phone you're rocking these days to shoot your video.

20
00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:09.250
And I mean it is actually an HD quality video.

21
00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.800
The new iPhones can actually shoot in for k which is kind of mind boggling.

22
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.990
Now here's the thing some people say well that's cheap and I don't want to shoot with my phone.

23
00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.450
How is it how is it possible it's going to come out great.

24
00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:28.240
Well there's actually a lot of videos you can find online like on YouTube and people who shoot video

25
00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.320
all the time and they only use smartphones.

26
00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:35.150
I've actually seen entire documentaries that have been shot on iPhone 7.

27
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.300
You can't really tell the difference actually what really matters here is that when you shoot with a

28
00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.550
smartphone it's going to save you a lot of money.

29
00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:49.030
But smartphones don't really like help you if you're trying to skimp on the other aspects of your video

30
00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.220
right.

31
00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:55.150
So a fighter 15000 or camera and that's filming and I didn't have very good lights or I didn't have

32
00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:56.670
a very good setting.

33
00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:03.480
Well that camera is so expensive and so good that it can actually kind of make up for the lack of light.

34
00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.950
Like for instance there's a camera called the Sony A7 ass R2 where you shot become a product manager

35
00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.530
in it.

36
00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.510
Well that one for instance can practically see in the dark.

37
00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:19.420
So if you have an improperly lit room you can actually make up for that and then you can still get a

38
00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:20.980
really good quality image.

39
00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.540
Now with smartphones you can use them.

40
00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.150
However if you wanted to look as good as the other ones you really have to make sure you're checking

41
00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.610
all the boxes in terms of lighting and setting.

42
00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.880
Now the reason why that is is a concept called dynamic range and your cameras basically just are not

43
00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:43.810
very good at displaying wide ranges of color and that's why when you're in the dark they have a really

44
00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.510
hard time differentiating between dark dark dark and just dark dark.

45
00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:54.770
So it is possible to use your smartphones but obviously the question now is should you rely on them.

46
00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.780
Really what I just say is if you have no budget then I think it's an option or if you're just dipping

47
00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:04.300
your toes in the water to see how it goes and then you know later you're gonna buy a better camera.

48
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:10.660
Now of course don't dip your toes in the water by making an ad in your iPhone or an explainer video

49
00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.010
with your iPhone.

50
00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:16.750
You probably don't know what kind of screw around with something more minor that people are going to

51
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:17.820
be more forgiving about.

52
00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.730
So if it's the case that all you need is great lighting and a great scene and then the smartphone pretty

53
00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.950
much makes up for anything you'd ever need.

54
00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.430
Why is it that more people don't use smartphones or why is it that everybody doesn't use smartphones.

55
00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:35.080
Well the problem is that one the dynamic range I mentioned before but also that your smart phones just

56
00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:40.150
have a lot of limitations that make it harder to do more fancy things with it.

57
00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:47.120
Like for instance your camera only has one lens on it and while the lens is pretty nice it's only one.

58
00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.960
You can't change it based on the setting you want.

59
00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:55.120
There are these like groovey lens attachments you can put on your camera or put on your smartphone.

60
00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.600
However I don't know how well those work.

61
00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:04.210
One thing that's worth mentioning is that the zoom on your can your smartphone is digital and so essentially

62
00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:11.080
what that means is when you zoom in it's not actually adjusting the lens in a way that it's focusing

63
00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:17.280
on one area more specifically only recording that what it's doing is it's just taking the same images

64
00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.490
taking before but it's zooming in on the image.

65
00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:20.950
That's it.

66
00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:26.320
So just zooming in on what it's already recording it's like if you took the video yourself and then

67
00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.580
just zoomed in on it.

68
00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.420
And that's why the quality kind of degrades what ends up happening is it just gets pixilated and all

69
00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:32.440
you know blocky.

70
00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:37.540
Now also one thing that's worth mentioning is that iPhones smartphones usually autofocus and auto adjust

71
00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:38.110
the image.

72
00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:44.290
So if you have like a lighting set up which you have to absolutely have you probably need to manually

73
00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:47.860
adjust a bunch of settings on the phone in order to get it right.

74
00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:53.050
Now one of those things is exposure which refers to the amount of light that the camera lets into the

75
00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:54.970
lens with a regular camera.

76
00:04:54.970 --> 00:05:00.120
You can usually leave all of the settings alone for really the first couple times you shoot but if you

77
00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.540
use your phone you might have to remember how to set everything up for later.

78
00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:06.610
And then of course there's the storage issue with your phone right.

79
00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:13.540
So if you want to record one minute of ATP video on an iPhone for example that's 130 megabytes of space.

80
00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:18.750
So once you start shooting you're going to need a lot of minutes and a lot of hard drive space.

81
00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:20.770
Well phones fill up pretty quickly.

82
00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:22.800
So that's kind of like the bottom level you could do.

83
00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:24.130
You could use smartphones.

84
00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:28.910
There are pros and cons to them if you have no budget and you're just trying to test this out than it

85
00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:30.410
you can definitely work with a smartphone.

86
00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:35.730
However you're going to focus more on your lighting and your setting to make up for some of the inherent

87
00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:37.440
disadvantages of the iPhone.

88
00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:43.500
You can absolutely use smartphones and there are entire movies shot on iPhones and that's kind of incredible.

89
00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:46.580
However it just takes more manual effort.

90
00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:48.630
You can't really zoom in correctly.

91
00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:50.700
You can't change the lens.

92
00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:56.040
It's really hard to shoot repeatedly without constantly backing up your phone to pay that much space

93
00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:56.560
it has.

94
00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:01.980
And it also just has poor dynamic range which really for your purposes means it doesn't do very well

95
00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:02.810
in low light.

96
00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:06.440
And like really bright settings too it really will get blown out.

97
00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:07.170
OK so there you go.

98
00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:10.100
Smart phones are really great task and they can capture really nice video.

99
00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:14.220
But if your iPhone is your primary camera Well you might really be pushing the limits specially if you

100
00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:15.380
have no idea what you're doing.

101
00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:19.800
Now an easier option is just to invest in a consumer level camera.

102
00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:22.700
And that's the next category of cameras that I want to get into here.

103
00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:27.540
Consumer level cameras are made specifically with everyday people in mind people who want to record

104
00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:32.970
videos of friends and families soccer games vacations make their own home movies you name it they want

105
00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:38.400
something relatively inexpensive that has a decent feature set and takes good videos and they do.

106
00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:43.860
When you look around for video cameras you'll see common brands usually like Canon Sony Panasonic.

107
00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:48.700
There's a lot of other ones obviously they're readily available at big box stores and online.

108
00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:52.020
Now consumer cameras are nice because they are really simple to use.

109
00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:57.180
They don't have all the bells and whistles of pro cameras which can actually limit them a little but

110
00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:00.370
they've got most of the basics that most people need.

111
00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:06.390
Now these cameras are usually smaller and they're very portable and easy to handle and they have no

112
00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:08.170
problem recording unlike tape.

113
00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:09.410
Let's talk about consumer cameras.

114
00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:15.300
I'm talking about more like and shoots and maybe even a little bit like camcorders.

115
00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:19.090
So they usually like Friends of the point and shoot let's say like the Sony cyber shot.

116
00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:24.120
Well it's just kind of a rectangle and you carry it around and it's really easy and portable and you

117
00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:28.160
can attach lenses to it although a lot of people just don't do that.

118
00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:33.210
It has a lot of the same controls that you'd find on a normal camera whereas like a smartphone is going

119
00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:34.490
to limit what you can do with it.

120
00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:36.750
With these you have a little bit more options.

121
00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:42.600
These are really popular for like liquor saying home videos because they're really easy to use pull

122
00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:44.050
up and then shoot with them.

123
00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:49.360
Not a lot of situations these like the cyber shot they can shoot in A.P. which is all you really need.

124
00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:54.450
But if you want to a fancy and go for k and then down sample Well you might have to pay a little bit

125
00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:54.810
extra.

126
00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:58.650
I'm not even sure if there are point and shoot cameras that can do that.

127
00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:02.670
So that's one thing to keep in mind but in general they're very economical.

128
00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:10.050
I mean you get a point and shoot that's pretty dang good for $150 $200 you can buy them used for highway

129
00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:14.550
last although they do go up to five hundred seven hundred.

130
00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:17.750
You don't really you're bang for your buck pass like the $400 Mark.

131
00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:20.850
It's not usually worth it if you're sticking in this category.

132
00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:24.670
Now are use these cameras before actually to shoot courses.

133
00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:29.390
However my general attitude towards them is that I use them as alternate care runs.

134
00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:33.080
So a lot of times in my older courses you'd have me talking like this.

135
00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:38.310
And then we have another angle where it cut to like the side of my face and it just says to mix it up

136
00:08:38.310 --> 00:08:38.870
a little bit.

137
00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:43.050
I've since kind of gotten rid of that but for that alternate one where I didn't care about the video

138
00:08:43.050 --> 00:08:48.380
quality as much I would use these point and shoots and in most cases they're perfectly fine.

139
00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:52.880
One thing that's worth doing if you're going to stick in this consumer level and you want to use one

140
00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:59.700
is easy to use cameras is look for mirrorless now mirrorless camera basically just means that it doesn't

141
00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:05.730
have a mirror between the lens and the sensor on the sensor is what actually picks up the light in the

142
00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:09.690
image and then codes it into your hard drive or your storage.

143
00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:10.470
Why does that matter.

144
00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:15.270
Well because when you have a mirror and it's something we'll talk about later with DSL as they hit the

145
00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:17.730
mirror and they bounce up and they do that.

146
00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:20.230
I'm not entirely sure why they do that with DSL ours.

147
00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:23.250
But I think it's because they want to protect the sensor.

148
00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:26.790
However when you do that it just kind of degrades the quality a little bit.

149
00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:33.120
And so if you find a mirror less in this middle category those actually can be quite good for video.

150
00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:34.790
So that's really the second tier.

151
00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:35.040
Right.

152
00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:39.810
If you only on a couple hundred bucks to spend well you can go get a point and shoot consumer camera

153
00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:41.360
and they're pretty good.

154
00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:45.130
I mean again you're going to have to focus on your lighting and your setting and everything else.

155
00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:47.990
However they're going to be more control over the image.

156
00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:52.470
Oftentimes they can shoot in whatever resolution you need usually to be tenants.

157
00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:57.720
There are I think some that are for k but it's also going to have a lot of the settings you'll find

158
00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:59.180
in like a pro level camera.

159
00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:00.640
Again great options.

160
00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:05.490
However you might be limited if you need to do something really fancy with the footage afterwards.

161
00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:11.610
Now once you step up to the third level what we call the prosumer camera level you can find more expensive

162
00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:15.030
cameras that can do a lot more and capture really nice video.

163
00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:20.910
Now again at this level you're to see the same brands is going to be Sony Canon Panasonic and generally

164
00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:26.100
all the other ones like Nikon but the price is going to be higher because the capabilities will be much

165
00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:26.630
higher.

166
00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:32.460
Now first off the chip that these cameras are going to use they're going to capture images in a more

167
00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:35.140
advanced way resulting in a nicer picture.

168
00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:40.620
They're also going to give you a lot of options to say how you want to record the image how you want

169
00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:41.460
to code it.

170
00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:45.000
And that actually can make a difference in the video quality if you know what you're doing.

171
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.680
Now many of these cameras also have the ability to shoot and Torquay is becoming more and more of the

172
00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:53.730
standard that they shoot and for AK and they generally are just going to have a lot more options for

173
00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:56.130
everything including capturing audio.

174
00:10:56.130 --> 00:11:01.470
They also offer a lot more options for controlling or changing your lens and manipulating the image

175
00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:02.630
as it's being recorded.

176
00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:06.750
They'll even have all pop out screens I'm changing turn around and watch yourself as you record just

177
00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:07.960
great if you're one person.

178
00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:12.090
Now maybe you want record in slow motion or maybe you want more options for adjusting the color of the

179
00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:12.480
image.

180
00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:15.770
Well these cameras and to give you more flexibility if you have those needs.

181
00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:19.450
Now at this level however you can expect to spend a lot more.

182
00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:24.540
Also with higher end cameras and you find yourself in the market for higher end accessories that's when

183
00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:26.150
it also gets really expensive.

184
00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:29.580
You can easily spend more on lenses than you can on a camera.

185
00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:33.780
So keep that in mind do you have lenses and you have all sorts other accessories that really starts

186
00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:34.780
to add up.

187
00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:36.560
Now what are we talking about when we talk about prices.

188
00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:38.690
Well with a pro-level camera.

189
00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:40.640
Really what I'm talking about are like DSL cars.

190
00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:41.010
Right.

191
00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:46.470
The ones that are so popular for photography are for whatever reason like the Canon 70 which is what

192
00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:50.030
I originally started filming with when I switched to DSL ours.

193
00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:54.720
It's really really popular on YouTube it's like the YouTube camera somebody kind of looks like I don't

194
00:11:54.720 --> 00:12:00.380
know bring it up I'm sure you've seen these before they're all kind of the same body type and shape.

195
00:12:00.390 --> 00:12:09.540
Now generally speaking you can get cheap ones probably in the low 400 low five hundreds and then these

196
00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:13.170
can go all the way up to like $5000.

197
00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:18.210
Generally speaking I think the sweet spot is going to be between a hundred and twelve hundred.

198
00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:24.890
And the reason why I say that is because the cheaper ones and the 400 700 range they have smaller sensors.

199
00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:27.450
They generally are just going to have cheaper bodies.

200
00:12:27.450 --> 00:12:34.200
They're going to have a lot of limitations that you can't really overcome if you become more into interested

201
00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:37.130
or into video you're just going to get a new camera.

202
00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:42.810
But if you get into the mid level range for these prosumer ones there's really nothing you can't do

203
00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:47.190
and you can stick with these cameras for multiple years before you get bored of them and want to go

204
00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:48.120
on to something better.

205
00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:53.760
Now the camera that I use and this is a bit of a trick is this one.

206
00:12:53.760 --> 00:13:00.120
So what it is it's called the Panasonic G.H. for I have two of these and eventually graduated from using

207
00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:02.970
the canon 70 D using this one.

208
00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:05.640
Now why do I like this camera.

209
00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:07.450
Well for two reasons.

210
00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:14.670
One this is the cheapest camera you can get and the prosumer category that can shoot for k this you

211
00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:21.240
can buy used cars there's five now for like $800 and you get brand new for like 950.

212
00:13:21.270 --> 00:13:25.020
That's the cheapest way you can shoot for k by far.

213
00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:29.070
The second reason why I like this is because it's made by Panasonic.

214
00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:35.040
Now when people think of cameras they always kind of dream about using the icons of the sonis or the

215
00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:41.250
canons and Panasonic is kind of considered like a cheaper brand but that doesn't necessarily mean that

216
00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:46.570
a cheaper brand can't make as nice of a camera just means that they focus on Usually the lower end.

217
00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:47.690
It's kind of like cars.

218
00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:48.060
Right.

219
00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:54.270
Like you have Porsches and you have Ferrari's and then you have like the Nissan JTR which is faster

220
00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:56.550
than any Porsche that's on the road.

221
00:13:56.790 --> 00:13:58.170
Well Nissan can do that.

222
00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:01.840
They just focus on in general cheaper cars.

223
00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:03.500
So it's off brand.

224
00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:07.660
And because of that people think it's our brand and they treat it like it's off brand.

225
00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:09.630
That gives you a significant discount.

226
00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:13.780
Pretty much like 25 percent lower than what you pay for the equivalent on canon.

227
00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:19.740
The Canon version of this is like a thousand and it's 70 or 70 and I thing just sucks.

228
00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:24.450
So really what you get in a video and you want to start by saving a lot of time and effort and money

229
00:14:24.450 --> 00:14:26.840
to this is honestly what I would suggest.

230
00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:32.130
And I was super resistant to getting it until eventually I just sucked it up and took it.

231
00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:35.270
And all of a sudden I realized oh my god there's so many things I can do with this.

232
00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:36.800
The image quality is fantastic.

233
00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:40.150
And that's why it's known as kind of a hack within the videographer community.

234
00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:42.910
It's a it's really really made for video.

235
00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:45.750
It's not something for photography you know that's enough cameras.

236
00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:47.560
Again there's three different levels.

237
00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:49.280
You have the lower level which are smartphones.

238
00:14:49.290 --> 00:14:53.190
You can do it but you've got to focus on making sure everything else is pretty much perfect then you

239
00:14:53.190 --> 00:14:59.520
can pay a little bit more on the 200 to $600 range to get a point and shoot if you can get a mirrorless

240
00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:01.590
version because that's going to look better on video.

241
00:15:01.710 --> 00:15:03.910
But in general it's going to be a lot more flexibility.

242
00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:06.650
Oftentimes someone is has once you can borrow it.

243
00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:11.460
Now the last stage is the prosumer and that's where we're talking about DSL are is and that's where

244
00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:17.580
really we start talking about cameras that can go anywhere from like $400 $500 for like the Canon rebels

245
00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:21.420
like the T-3 eyes all the way up to like man.

246
00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:29.170
Like what do we have the canon 300 or the Sony A7 s are two are those are getting in like the three

247
00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:31.450
grand four grand five grand range.

248
00:15:31.510 --> 00:15:37.060
So pick which one you think you're comfortable with and kind of vary that with how serious you are about

249
00:15:37.090 --> 00:15:37.680
filming.

250
00:15:37.690 --> 00:15:39.520
Keeping in mind views cheaper cameras.

251
00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:41.740
Well you have to make up for it with better equipment.

252
00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:45.060
But if you want to dive right in and you know you're into cameras.

253
00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:51.410
Well my suggestion is to do the G.H. for it's super cheap you can buy it on Amazon use below a hundred

254
00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:56.710
and it's not something you are ever going to really replace unless of course we come out with 12 K and

255
00:15:56.710 --> 00:16:00.490
then all of sudden you have to use 12 k are going to take a quick break next lecture I'm going to talk

256
00:16:00.490 --> 00:16:01.860
about video equipment.
