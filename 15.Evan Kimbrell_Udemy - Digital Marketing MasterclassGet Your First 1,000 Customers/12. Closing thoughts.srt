00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:05,860
Hey guys welcome back and let's finish up this section on search engine marketing and social ads.

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:11,280
So in our lectures and the section we step through the process for getting set up and onwards and running

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:16,410
ads through Google and then we went through the same process and Facebook for ads on their network.

4
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:21,480
Well you've got the steps now for advertising on two major networks arguably the biggest ones in the

5
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,390
world currently.

6
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:27,250
And we know different ways to find and influence your audience whether you choose to focus on keywords

7
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:32,880
through say like add words and focus on people who have demonstrated intent or appealing to an audience

8
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,220
with ads in a variety of different formats on Facebook.

9
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:40,620
You should have plenty of opportunity to get yourself in front of customers to accomplish your goals.

10
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:45,720
Now the biggest difference between SVM efforts and what you would do for say like a CEO is that the

11
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:47,520
image just cost money.

12
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,510
Ultimately you have to figure out if paid options like ad words and Facebook ads or just in general

13
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:51,990
worth it.

14
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:56,790
Smaller businesses might assume paid efforts aren't worth it because they might not have a lot of money

15
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:01,560
to work with but paid advertising is a channel that can give an immediate boost to traffic and other

16
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:04,180
helpful metrics far more quickly than you could.

17
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:09,770
As you know I by suggestion is that if you're someone who's just selling something then running an easy

18
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,180
because while you recoup that money pretty quickly.

19
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:19,530
But if you're someone who is not or just takes longer for people to pay you then it might be a problem

20
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:21,140
to paying what your budget is.

21
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:25,530
Obviously keep in mind this just takes a lot of time to figure out you're not immediately going to make

22
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:26,360
the numbers work.

23
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:30,750
So I'm going to leave you with this advise some of which has probably been said in a section of a course

24
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:36,420
already longtail key words in general can be a huge bargain by researching keywords that have lower

25
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:40,650
competition and you can potentially find phrases and questions that really define who your audience

26
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:42,180
is and what they're looking for.

27
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:43,220
Don't try to write for keywords.

28
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:48,780
Lots of huge companies fighting or other his advice always be testing both Edwards and Facebook ads

29
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:54,090
offer opportunities to set up testing to see which ads perform better with your goals and might remember

30
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:56,550
to test one change only at a time.

31
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:59,820
This way you'll know what one thing actually made a difference.

32
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,140
Change too many things.

33
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:01,920
I don't know.

34
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:03,170
You don't really know where to start.

35
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:08,560
But you also generally understand my theory about running ads which is a least on Google.

36
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,000
I want you to start off with two things are entirely different to angles.

37
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:16,850
See which one works better and then kind of narrow down now and changing one thing at a time.

38
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:21,650
On Facebook the first thing I generally want to do is look for the right audience and then start work

39
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:22,450
on the right message.

40
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,520
Then in a related story every campaign is different but don't ignore what you've learned.

41
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:31,050
Different campaigns might mean different goals different audiences different keywords you name it but

42
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:33,090
that doesn't mean you have to start from scratch.

43
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:38,820
Pay attention and make note of what worked for past successes and failures as well so that you can set

44
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:43,080
a starting point for new campaigns that's educated and closer to where you need to be.

45
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:44,110
And one more thing.

46
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:45,660
Watch your competition.

47
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:49,920
Odds are you've got someone else out there fighting you for the exact same territory.

48
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,130
Do yourself a favor and search for their products and Google or check out their page on Facebook.

49
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,530
First you'll get to look at how they're marketing themselves and creating content to appeal to your

50
00:02:58,530 --> 00:02:59,520
audience.

51
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,430
You might also get shown some of their ads in the process.

52
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:08,550
I personally also like to use like SVM rush because it'll show you all of the ads that are working for

53
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:10,680
your competitors are always the ones that they're targeting.

54
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:13,800
You can look at that and see if that's a strategy you think also could work.

55
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:19,190
Also make note of what language they use what images they use the deals they're trying to call to action.

56
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:22,130
Use that to your advantage and create ads that will beat theirs.

57
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:26,260
But honestly don't reinvent the wheel if they've spent two years working on something they figured out

58
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:27,300
so it works.

59
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,300
Borrow from them test out your designs and after a while.

60
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,790
Do the same research again.

61
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:34,610
You can bet that they'll probably be watching your next move as well.

62
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:34,920
All right.

63
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,880
Best of luck with your SCA efforts.

64
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,020
I'll see you guys next time.
