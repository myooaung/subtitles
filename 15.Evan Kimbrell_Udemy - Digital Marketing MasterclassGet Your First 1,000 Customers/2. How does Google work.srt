1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:02,040
Hey guys welcome back.

2
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:02,540
OK.

3
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:06,520
We've just started on our section of our course so let's get back into it.

4
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:13,050
If s.c.s the answer search engine optimization then it probably stands to reason that you should understand

5
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:14,990
how search engines work.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,470
How can you optimize something if you don't understand the intricacies of how they work and how they

7
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:20,250
make decisions.

8
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,320
So how do they work.

9
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:22,620
Well it's a good question.

10
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:25,890
Now when I say search engines I'm really talking about Google.

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:26,810
It's the top player.

12
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,220
It's the LeBron James of search.

13
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:36,540
If Lebron James is only one of two basketball players in the entire world and the other one was three

14
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:39,100
feet tall asthmatic and overweight.

15
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:43,590
That's also to say if LeBron James decided to not only play basketball but run the league change the

16
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:48,240
rules when he felt like it and also created tools for other players to learn how to play the game better

17
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,720
and reality so you can stuff them in their face.

18
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:55,140
I don't honestly know it's kind of hard to come up with a good metaphor because the best term really

19
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:56,270
is monopoly.

20
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,210
But we're not allowed to use that word.

21
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:03,180
Google basically invented the search industry and many of the tools everyone uses to measure usage and

22
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:08,730
content including the Google search console formerly known as the Google Webmaster Tools.

23
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:13,470
And so it's been the top search engine for pretty much ever since I can remember except for in the 90s

24
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:18,820
when there was a toss up tween like Lycos and webcrawler and Yahoo.

25
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,260
Hello.

26
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:24,530
Ridiculous ones today accounts for over 77 percent of all the searches in the world.

27
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:29,430
And to be honest they could probably get to 100 percent but they don't want to be sued by the U.S. government

28
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:31,150
for antitrust competition.

29
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:35,670
But Google also has set many of the rules for how search engines work specially things like ranking

30
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:36,440
factors.

31
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:37,990
So let's explain this a little bit.

32
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,820
So Google they crawl the web basically downloading every page you can find.

33
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:47,130
And then it indexes all of those pages while it makes note of the text written on each page along with

34
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:52,230
the tags and code behind the scenes used to create the links images and to define other attributes of

35
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:52,760
the page.

36
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:59,160
Google's goal is to rank pages for terms so when someone searches for a hot fudge sundae for example

37
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:02,190
they want to see a list of pages most relevant to that term.

38
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:07,770
When Google first started out most relevant meant the list of pages that use the term the most or had

39
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:09,480
the most links from other pages.

40
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:15,300
But some other people were able to game the system and start loading up pages and terms like a hundred

41
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:21,660
times or using other bad practices known as black hat SEO to make their pages appear more relevant than

42
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:22,420
they actually were.

43
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,570
Why it's called Black Hat.

44
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:28,740
I don't know black is like dark and evil and maybe evil people wear black hats.

45
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:29,450
I'm not really sure.

46
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:33,900
But the alternative is white hat which basically means legal and approved.

47
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,730
Now why would people want to be ranked at the top of a search engine result.

48
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,810
I cannot believe I'm asking this question out loud.

49
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:43,590
Well because the top results of the page get the majority of the clicks from people who do the search.

50
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:48,930
Those are the top three results usually get 80 percent of the clicks and it gets more dramatic as you

51
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:49,950
go down the page.

52
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:54,680
There's actually an old joke that says where is the best place to hide a dead body.

53
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,900
And they say the second page of search results on Google.

54
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:03,180
That basically means that something like 2 percent of people will ever make it to the second page of

55
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:03,930
a search result.

56
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:07,920
Now businesses are relying on search traffic to get their customers of the Web site to buy the things

57
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,090
and generate the revenues.

58
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:12,660
You've got to believe companies will do whatever they can to get ranked higher.

59
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,400
It is basically free money.

60
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,320
They can do it well.

61
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,610
Well today competition is still fierce for many of these keywords but Google's results are more accurate

62
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:22,620
than ever thanks to their search algorithm.

63
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:28,190
Now that's like their top secret recipe that defines what helps a page rank higher for a specific term.

64
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:33,630
No one knows exactly how it works because if they did well they'd be multi-billionaire because Google

65
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,220
holds the balance.

66
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:38,910
Billions and billions of dollars of business value.

67
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:42,410
Now we know what some of the ranking factors are and we'll discuss them in the lectures to come.

68
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:44,110
But we don't know all of them.

69
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:49,110
Now since Google obviously he can't tell you what's in their search engine they instead tell you to

70
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,550
instead of trying to game their system.

71
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:57,050
Just focus on making web pages and blog posts and all that other content as good as possible.

72
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:00,900
Simply concentrate on making the best stuff you can.

73
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:05,940
They're trying to make the Internet better because after all if you search on Google and you keep repeatedly

74
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:12,830
going to pages that are relevant but poorly written bad resources just a just a hack job.

75
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:16,040
Well that's actually going to reflect back on Google Believe it or not.

76
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:20,070
And obviously does make sense you will go to Google with questions looking for data help instructions

77
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:24,150
details and other information call content that just doesn't suck is what people want.

78
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:29,010
And that content will need to be available in more ways than ever especially since the way people search

79
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:32,110
for things and trying to find information these days continues to evolve.

80
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:37,190
More searches happen on mobile devices than laptops now is still something that blows my mind.

81
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:41,070
There's more video content being produced and searched for than ever before.

82
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:45,730
YouTube is the number two largest search engine in the world and a lot more people are actually using

83
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:50,330
personal voice assistance like Siri and Amazon echo to get information.

84
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:54,570
Now the nature of search and the way we structure information is changing rapidly because people want

85
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:58,790
stuff when they want it where ever they are and how ever they want it.

86
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,400
And those three facts are also changing.

87
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,000
So what exactly does this mean for the show.

88
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:06,250
Well we need to continue to follow Google's lead at least for now.

89
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:09,830
It's the number one option for people and they search and those people are your potential customers

90
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:11,160
investors and partners.

91
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:15,140
This as the ascension of course going to step you through a lot of the fundamentals and guidelines Google

92
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:15,840
has.

93
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:20,700
So it's important to make note of the strategies and tactics we'll cover by following the steps we cover.

94
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,580
You should be able to get to a point where you understand SBO much better than you did before.

95
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:31,370
You should be able to apply it back to the pages you've already made and you should be able to understand

96
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:38,540
at least how you could create a forward going or outgoing strategy to take advantage of keywords and

97
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:41,020
to bring in more traffic from search more effectively.

98
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:48,170
Again as CEO is a long term play you're not going to get an Nescio learn in two hours how to make millions

99
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:49,920
of dollars and then do that tomorrow.

100
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:54,680
You're going understand that you're going to try to tinker with it or modify and you're going to learn

101
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:59,450
and over time you'll slowly get more and more search from MCO until it gets to a point where if you're

102
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:03,830
doing it correctly it's going be a mountain of traffic compared to everything else.

103
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,350
Oh and as CEO again it's free.

104
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:07,060
All right guys you ready.

105
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:09,110
We're going to dive deeper and S.E. on the next lecture.

106
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:09,530
See the.
