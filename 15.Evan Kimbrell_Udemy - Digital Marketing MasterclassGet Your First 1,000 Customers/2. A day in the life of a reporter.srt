00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,310
Hey guys, welcome back to the course.
1

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:06,540
Okay, so we're just getting started 
learning about press and PR.
2

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:11,670
And before we start learning about tactics, and pitching 
yourself to the media, and all that, it's really
3

4
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:15,530
important to look at both sides of this whole PR situation.
4

5
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:21,060
Now, on one side, there's you, someone with a product 
or service you're trying to sell, or some kind of business
5

6
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:23,550
venture you're trying to get off the ground. For you,
6

7
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:28,830
PR is an opportunity - getting more visibility through 
press coverage can lead to traffic, customers, and
7

8
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:30,180
other related benefits.
8

9
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:33,240
Now, if press to you is basically free marketing,
9

10
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:37,220
that is absolutely not what it is to 
the person covering you. To them,
10

11
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:41,170
they want interesting stories that 
match what their audience cares about.
11

12
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:45,180
So it's kind of like a little bit of a Venn diagram, you're 
going to have to find the middle between "free press"
12

13
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,480
and "this is actually an interesting story."
13

14
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,310
So on the flip side of PR,
14

15
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:56,460
well, you're going to have a writer or a reporter, or 
a blog or industry site owner, someone whose job
15

16
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:57,920
it is to write stories.
16

17
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:03,540
Oftentimes, they have to write lots of them, and 
those have to be interesting to their audience.
17

18
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:08,540
Reporters and other members of the media are the 
people you're trying to reach through these PR efforts,
18

19
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:10,790
so it would help to understand who they are.
19

20
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,190
so it would help to understand who they are.
20

21
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:15,320
So in this lecture I want to step you through a day 
in the life of a reporter and give you an idea about
21

22
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:17,040
who you'll be looking for,
22

23
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:21,720
trying to sell yourself and your ideas to,
and maybe creating a relationship with.
23

24
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,680
Not like that.
24

25
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:27,960
I mean like a work relationship. The better you know 
them, the better prepared you will be to work with them.
25

26
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:28,350
I mean like a work relationship. The better you know 
them, the better prepared you will be to work with them.
26

27
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:29,170
So here we go.
27

28
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:30,940
This is a day in the life of a reporter.
28

29
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,460
And if you guys have actually been a writer or something 
like that, please don't give me angry comments,
29

30
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:38,400
because everyone's day is a little bit different,
30

31
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,070
but there are some commonalities 
that we're going to explore.
31

32
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:43,670
All right, so I'm an average reporter, it's 3:00 AM,
32

33
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,040
I'm going to wake up and it's all about 
doing Pilates and eating quinoa.
33

34
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:47,610
All right, I'm just kidding, I'm not 
that sarcastic about the press.
34

35
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:49,950
All right, I'm just kidding, I'm not 
that sarcastic about the press.
35

36
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:53,390
Reporters are just regular people, just like you and me.
36

37
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,140
That is really the first lesson here.
37

38
00:01:55,140 --> 00:02:00,420
Think about what your day is like, once you get rolling after 
your morning coffee, or your first Mountain Dew of the day.
38

39
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,370
Think about what your day is like, once you get rolling after 
your morning coffee, or your first Mountain Dew of the day.
39

40
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,830
More than likely, you'll be looking for 
ways to accomplish your regular goals.
40

41
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:09,330
Create new content to promote your products to your 
audience to attract more customers, and think up
41

42
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:11,010
new ideas to improve your business.
42

43
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:12,810
Well, reporters aren't much different.
43

44
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:17,760
They're creating new content to publish on their 
outlet for their audience, they're looking to attract
44

45
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,350
more readers, and they're thinking up 
new ideas and things to write about.
45

46
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:27,290
At the core, we're all pretty similar, but the way 
reporters go about their jobs is much, much different.
46

47
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:32,400
While you're focusing on a product, like maybe an 
app, their product is their writing, their posts, their
47

48
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,100
lists, their e-books,  their social media stuff, you name it.
48

49
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:39,880
Their job is to create written material, so writers 
are always in search of something to publish.
49

50
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,520
That's the first thing to remember about them.
50

51
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:46,060
For example, some tech blog writers 
don't actually get paid a salary.
51

52
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,580
Like, I don't know if it's necessarily true right 
now, but it used to be the case at Mashable,
52

53
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:51,790
they would get paid by the page view.
53

54
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:58,110
Even today, people who contribute to Huffington Post,
like the regular contributors, they get paid per page view.
54

55
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:58,730
Even today, people who contribute to Huffington Post,
like the regular contributors, they get paid per page view.
55

56
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:03,780
So either they have to write long pieces with lots of 
pages, which usually doesn't fly on some of these
56

57
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:08,010
websites, or lots of pieces. Either way,
they need ideas to write about.
57

58
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:13,060
So the life of a reporter very much involves 
writing and publishing. At any given moment,
58

59
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,620
they're probably thinking about their next 
few posts while writing their current one.
59

60
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:21,600
They have a responsibility to keep producing material
for their outlet, whether that outlet is a news
60

61
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,660
site, blog, or another kind of content machine.
61

62
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:29,640
They need to keep feeding that machine. And these
ideas for new material need to be good ones.
62

63
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:35,070
Reporters are always looking for something interesting
to write about. With all of these pieces they
63

64
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:39,720
need to write about, well, their topics need to be 
something of interest to the people who are going to
64

65
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,280
be coming onto their page.
65

66
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,410
And it would really help if they had a cool unique kind 
of angle to it. Reporters won't succeed if they just
66

67
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:49,530
write the same stuff over and over,
and audiences get bored of it.
67

68
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:51,810
So what else are reporters doing every day?
68

69
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:53,560
They're doing a lot of research.
69

70
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:59,040
It involves reading other blogs and sites, googling topics 
to see what's out there, and reaching out to people
70

71
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,480
they know for material.
71

72
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,430
Now, at this point, you might be thinking, "Hm, reporters
would probably appreciate it if I contacted them about
72

73
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:06,730
my awesome product, right?"
73

74
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:10,980
Well, you and lots of other people
have had the same idea.
74

75
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,010
So another part of a reporter's day is actually just spent 
reviewing requests from random uninvited people
75

76
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:23,400
like you who want to get coverage, and to the busiest 
reporters, they can often get hundreds and hundreds
76

77
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,710
of them in a single day.
77

78
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:30,000
Let's not overlook the fact too about reporters that 
many of them work for editors whose job it is to make
78

79
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,240
sure the pieces being written match the outlets' 
brand and have potential for popularity.
79

80
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:39,150
So reporters not only need to find great ideas and write 
great stuff, but they need to have approval from an editor.
80

81
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:40,280
So reporters not only need to find great ideas and write 
great stuff, but they need to have approval from an editor.
81

82
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:47,900
Basically, it's like another audience the reporter has to satisfy. So you might win over the writer or the reporter,
82

83
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:50,940
but that doesn't necessarily mean
it's going to make it up the chain.
83

84
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,130
Now, if this sounds like a lot of work,
84

85
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:54,590
that's because, well, it often is.
85

86
00:04:54,660 --> 00:05:00,460
So another attribute of many reporters is that they 
can actually be pretty lazy, that's one thing to keep
86

87
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:03,290
in mind. I don't mean lazy like they don't do their job,
87

88
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:05,720
you know, obviously, if they don't write
and publish stuff, then they get fired.
88

89
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:10,180
I mean lazy in that they're going to look for writing 
ideas and topics that don't take a lot of energy
89

90
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:11,570
or time to develop.
90

91
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:14,850
They're always going to be looking
for low hanging fruit, if you will,
91

92
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:19,960
easy to pick and do something with. Basically, what that 
amounts to for you, from your perspective, is that
92

93
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:25,210
oftentimes a reporter might be interested in two 
different stories - one story requires a lot of research,
93

94
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:29,000
requires a lot of writing, polishing, fact 
checking, and then the other one,
94

95
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,450
well, two thirds of the story is already written for them.
95

96
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:35,890
So 9 times out of 10 they're going to go for that one 
that's already written for them. Later on we're going to
96

97
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:40,300
talk about that, how you can prepackage your 
stories in a way that makes it easy for their laziness
97

98
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,400
to say "I'll do that."
98

99
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,720
All right, so let's recap.
99

100
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:48,130
Reporters are always in search of something to 
publish, because, well, their jobs basically depend on it.
100

101
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:49,330
This obviously depends on the outlet.
101

102
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:56,350
Some have more of a "publish or die" kind of ethos and
then other ones are more like "you can publish one
102

103
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:58,030
thing a month or two things a month,"
103

104
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:00,670
but still, at the same time, they're 
constantly looking for stuff.
104

105
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:05,350
Number two is they're always looking for something 
interesting, but often deal with hundreds and hundreds
105

106
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:06,640
of uninteresting pitches.
106

107
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:12,280
And number three, they're often quite lazy, so they 
need ideas that are easier to work with or are at
107

108
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,810
least more developed for them.
108

109
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:16,480
So if you're a reporter, what would make your job easier?
109

110
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:20,430
Someone researching and writing your stuff 
for you would be a pretty nice start, wouldn't it?
110

111
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:24,010
Well, it's actually not as crazy as it sounds, and when it 
comes to PR, you have a better chance of connecting
111

112
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:28,650
with them if you kind of fill in the 
gaps in their daily challenges for them.
112

113
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:32,860
Now, if you do approach them with a good, 
interesting story, then you are doing them a favor,
113

114
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:38,950
but if you just approach them with the 40th app 
that does the same thing and it's not as nice as the
114

115
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:41,550
other ones, and it doesn't have any customers,
115

116
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,890
well, no, you're not actually doing them a favor.
116

117
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:48,010
Anyway, moving forward in the PR section of the course,
we'll discuss ways in which you can pitch ideas to reporters
117

118
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:51,680
and other members of the media, and then appeal 
to their needs while also satisfying your own.
118

119
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,840
Alright guys, see you in the next lecture.
