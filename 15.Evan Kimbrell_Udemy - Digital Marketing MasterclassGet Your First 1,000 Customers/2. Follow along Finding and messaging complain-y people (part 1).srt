1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:07,080
Hey guys welcome back to the chorus so we're going to follow along for the complaining people section.

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,790
Do you guys are kind of over this technique.

3
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:09,830
Just skip the lecture.

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:16,070
So we did a demo of this but I'm going to try to bring this home and do it from one of my courses.

5
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:18,660
We'll see how it goes.

6
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:24,870
OK so first up what I think I'm going to do is I'm going to try to promote the how to come up with killer

7
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:31,470
business ideas course because that one's a little more it's easier to find people who are complaining

8
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:38,640
about business ideas because if I'm searching for a business ideas it's a lot easier and cleaner to

9
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,600
find that than say looking at a program.

10
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,170
So let's say I was doing preprograming or my non-technical course for people who don't want to learn

11
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:51,840
how to program the search for learning how to program or difficulty programming things like that you

12
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,640
just get a lot of noise.

13
00:00:53,640 --> 00:01:01,170
You know a lot of people who are talking about programs or people who clearly know how to program just

14
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:04,700
talking about programming and it's just choked up.

15
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:06,500
It really just wasn't a very good search term.

16
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:09,380
This one I think it's going to work a little bit better.

17
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:11,450
OK so in complaining people.

18
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,620
We did two things.

19
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:18,440
One was we talked about was the problem that people are having and then how would they express that.

20
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:25,170
OK so for my how to come up with killer business ideas of course to give myself a plug.

21
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:27,530
The whole point with this one was just people who are stuck.

22
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:32,040
People who want to start businesses but they feel like they don't know how to come up with ideas and

23
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:37,230
it's best to give them a tool set and a way of thinking that will make it a lot easier or at least give

24
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:42,660
them kind of like a step by step to get to a point where it's not as much of a stretch to them come

25
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:44,080
up with an idea.

26
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:52,070
So if someone was in that kind of category the like I want to quit my job and be a full time entrepreneur.

27
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:57,380
But an idea what exactly would those people be saying.

28
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:02,370
So there's a lot of things we could it's probably just going to be around like trouble with business

29
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:07,610
ideas or not enough business ideas.

30
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:13,410
They could say business ideas aren't good or what's the value of it.

31
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:18,870
One thing you commonly see people complain about when they're in this early stage is protection of their

32
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:19,920
business idea.

33
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:25,180
So they might say well if I have one how do I protected or what if someone steals it.

34
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,810
There's a lot of these questions are just a lot of people not like early stage of entrepreneurship get

35
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:34,450
to and they'll constantly say these the stuff like ad nauseum.

36
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:41,430
So before I get started what I did was I went to Billy and just created a trackable link and Romany's

37
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:43,910
this link with a coupon code.

38
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,380
Go get you 10.

39
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:49,940
And then what we'll do is we'll watch the revenue to see if we can actually make sales with this.

40
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,130
I don't honestly I don't know if we will or not.

41
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:56,940
I mean is this just because it's more trackable see which posts are actually getting clicked.

42
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,740
We actually cover this later on.

43
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,480
And taking a break section.

44
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:07,710
We'll talk about how to use linking strategies and how to set these up more efficiently in a more sophisticated

45
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:08,320
way.

46
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:12,120
Like for instance we'll cover how many links come out as Evan K..

47
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:17,630
I am right so they don't look as spammy because they look similar to my name and that's just like a

48
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:19,550
little trickle will do later on.

49
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:25,830
Anyway so this is what I'm going to use to try to find some complaining people.

50
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:28,800
So first thing we always do is just Twitter.

51
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:37,150
So we'll try to use some of those search terms that we had before you go to search dot Twitter dot com.

52
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:39,300
That's always the first step.

53
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:45,360
And then what I might do is a broad search for just business ideas in general.

54
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:50,520
Now it doesn't have to be what we want to look for complaints right like people struggling with it or

55
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:53,060
in general some kind of frustration.

56
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:59,160
But I think this is a good way to canvass first and then get a better idea of how we want to maybe narrow

57
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:07,200
it down to which belong to our users came to be that way.

58
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:13,500
Shout out to everyone who spent the weekend working on their business ideas growing online or sharing

59
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,390
business ideas.

60
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,060
Interesting.

61
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:21,600
So a lot of these are going to be decently well-known Twitter accounts that are posting their own stuff

62
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:27,280
and we can piggy back that that's perfectly fine.

63
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:29,260
The question when you piggyback.

64
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:36,000
So like if this person said you know join this or whatever and I post down here and said some kind of

65
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,370
quip related to this how many people are going to see this.

66
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:43,530
And it's really just going to depend on how many people liked it.

67
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:45,180
And then this right here.

68
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:52,350
So when they post it you know it might be the case that instead of posting here I can go to retweet.

69
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:58,590
And then literally go after these people instead because they're clearly interested in it and that might

70
00:04:58,590 --> 00:04:59,930
be one angle of attack.

71
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:10,540
But let's see as person is tired of not talking about business ideas as persons trying to sell something.

72
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:16,140
Here's a list of five ideas starting on one business.

73
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,170
See you looking for new ideas.

74
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:27,360
Growth that's growing your business would be business ideas teams pitch to business ideas for one minute.

75
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:28,730
This is fast.

76
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:37,010
This that is my brain is currently thinking of new ways to make money in pristine pristine small business

77
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:39,690
ideas and I know what that means could I.

78
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:50,270
So what we're going to do is I'm going to start compiling a list of people that I can come back to and

79
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:56,930
message and I'm only looking for ones that are new ish new and off like I don't want to get something

80
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:59,540
that's a week old on a really active

81
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,500
account.

82
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:09,620
Funny story Ryan Robinson I actually use him later as a competitor and he's my neighbor literally my

83
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,690
neighbor.

84
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:12,360
See

85
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:42,660
maybe.

86
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:52,200
Ok so I can use an idea of maybe how we should narrow this down so we'll go back to search.

87
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,780
So what were you saying.

88
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,160
New business idea.

89
00:06:55,180 --> 00:07:00,060
No no business ideas bad business ideas business ideas.

90
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:08,100
So you only get.

91
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,020
That's actually another you and me instructor

92
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,900
just want to I can probably piggyback

93
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:42,650
now.

94
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:53,550
Let's see if we really can find people complaining about business ideas to come up and say that's a

95
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:54,950
search term or better

96
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:10,100
or old has aspirations coming up with ideas for their name the same thing.

97
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:11,090
Here's one.

98
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:14,860
All this is really old unfortunately.

99
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:17,460
I'll use it.

100
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,180
See

101
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,310
another one.

102
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:31,630
All again still harping on the whole like it's hard to come up with business ideas so maybe we go after

103
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:34,370
the people that are retweeting it.

104
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:40,200
Working hard to come though.

105
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:49,300
Isn't complaining but it's not exactly what we're talking about.

106
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:55,490
Isn't complaining about business names.

107
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:57,830
I don't believe we cover that my course.

108
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:08,760
This person is saying that hard hard design is hard.

109
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:11,020
Person like this one is perfect.

110
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:14,630
But it's just old

111
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:24,510
and spurious and is expressing some frustration with it.

112
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:30,210
Is all the old ones are really old.

113
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:32,310
So we might need to change our filters.

114
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:48,300
So we're rolling it to look for things that have been happening in the last let's say 10 weeks.

115
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,420
Here's an example of one decent one.

116
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:18,030
Another one we have some people that are at least in this stage or someone

117
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,360
EHRSSON

118
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:33,450
percent saying hey free business is up person this is what it is it parabens about their ability to

119
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:35,390
come up with them.

120
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:38,330
Sure we can riff on that somehow.

121
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:48,730
This is always talking about the process of it would be potentially

122
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:10,800
All right so I think of a decent sample of people who have recently been talking about coming up with

123
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,800
business ideas.

124
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,380
They're not all in the negative.

125
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:14,640
Some of them are.

126
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:20,420
Some of them are more like saying it's hard but they can help you whatever.

127
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:21,820
So I just listed those out.

128
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:27,240
And then let's hit up Reddit which was the next one and see what we have there.

129
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:31,130
So it will say hard to come up.

130
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:45,350
Is So you have old post from on the so called entrepreneur and it's mostly people just asking about

131
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:46,710
it.

132
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:52,250
You know any business idea if I wanted to live it the more recent ones where I could use it tools over

133
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:56,030
here and we'll just say past week

134
00:11:59,050 --> 00:11:59,710
thing

135
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:11,430
was a subset of dedicated to being high enough that you reach customer

136
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,440
this person potentially

137
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:29,280
and still check out the posts.

138
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:46,050
So this person is talking about business ideas and college work like this is exactly what we're looking

139
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:47,280
for.

140
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:57,280
Pretty bold.

141
00:12:57,530 --> 00:13:02,300
OK so we could post in here.

142
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:09,490
I don't know if it's going to seem you can also directly message some people depending on it.

143
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:16,530
In a private message like a private message this person might do that.
