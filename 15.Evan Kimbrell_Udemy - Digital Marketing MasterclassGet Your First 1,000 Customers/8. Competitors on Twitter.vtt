00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.880
And we are back. Now, this is the last
lecture about Twitter in this section
1

2
00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:10.350
of the course. Twitter will definitely
come up again more than once later on,
2

3
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.700
but you are off the Twitter hook for a while right
after this lecture. In this lecture, we're going to
3

4
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.180
talk about people on Twitter who
are talking about your competitors.
4

5
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.930
Now, there is a reason why people
complain about companies on Twitter.
5

6
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.350
That reason is that almost all
businesses have a Twitter account.
6

7
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:34.140
In fact, as of I think it was last year, Twitter estimated that
almost two thirds of all U.S. companies have some sort
7

8
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.390
of a presence on Twitter.
8

9
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:41.130
And when you can't get a response to the numerous
e-mails you sent to a company, or if you're like me and
9

10
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.130
too lazy to wait on hold with customer service,
10

11
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.790
why not complain on Twitter?
11

12
00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:51.630
It is public after all, which means you're more likely to get
a response from someone at the company, even if the
12

13
00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:57.030
person responding is one of those millennials who
companies hire to run their social media because the
13

14
00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.670
executives have no clue how this works.
14

15
00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.710
It's like phoning into the customer service line,
15

16
00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:08.240
if that conversation was being streamed
online for hundreds of people to watch.
16

17
00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.250
Now, some companies even have dedicated customer 
service Twitter accounts, like, for instance, everyone's
17

18
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:23.560
favorite ISO, Comcast. ISO, of course, stands for - anyone? -
Internet Service Overlord. Comcast's customer service
18

19
00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:30.660
account is hilariously called @ComcastCares, which is probably
just the epitome of what we call a corporate facepalm.
19

20
00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:31.820
account is hilariously called @ComcastCares, which is probably
just the epitome of what we call a corporate facepalm.
20

21
00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:38.610
Regardless, these accounts are a great place to
meet people who don't like a company's service.
21

22
00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.830
Pretty obvious. Before we jump further into this,
22

23
00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:46.440
we need to talk a little bit about competitors.
Technically speaking, what is a competitor?
23

24
00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.630
I'm sure some companies come to mind
when you're thinking about your product,
24

25
00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.110
but let's take a minute or two
to try to actually break it down.
25

26
00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:59.310
A competitor is someone who competes
for the same users or the same customers.
26

27
00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.110
Sounds relatively obvious, but it's actually not.
27

28
00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:10.110
In fact, there are several different ways that you can classify
your competitors based on how they compete with you.
28

29
00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:10.580
In fact, there are several different ways that you can classify
your competitors based on how they compete with you.
29

30
00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.120
For instance, a direct competitor is anyone who is
targeting the same group of people you are targeting
30

31
00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.040
and with a very similar product.
31

32
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.790
They are direct because consumers can
do almost like a one to one comparison.
32

33
00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:28.180
If you lose a sale, there's a good chance it could
instead end up with one of your direct competitors.
33

34
00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:34.020
The other classification worth knowing, we're going to skip
the other two for this lecture, is an indirect competitor.
34

35
00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:42.060
An indirect competitor, on the other hand, goes after
not the same customers per se, but the same needs,
35

36
00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:47.320
and they generally are going to do it with
a product that is not really the same.
36

37
00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.570
It's pretty different.
37

38
00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:55.580
A restaurant, for instance, is an indirect competitor
to, say, a frozen pizza company like DiGiorno.
38

39
00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.250
They both solve hunger and a casual lust for pizza.
39

40
00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.770
Now, can you guess who might be a
direct competitor to DiGiorno? Rubber.
40

41
00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:09.950
A circular tube of rubber you found on the side
of the road is a direct competitor to DiGiorno.
41

42
00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:15.240
They are virtually indistinguishable from each other,
and if you eat them, presumably you will become full.
42

43
00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.740
They are virtually indistinguishable from each other,
and if you eat them, presumably you will become full.
43

44
00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:17.460
Now, why bring this up?
44

45
00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:23.510
Well, because it's very easy to lose
sight of who the true competitor is.
45

46
00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.250
Quick rule of thumb.
46

47
00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.040
Do they have a similar product
targeting the same people?
47

48
00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:37.500
Or are they at least targeting the same need or problem,
but with something kind of funky and not directly
48

49
00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.530
comparable to what you're trying to use?
49

50
00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:45.060
As long as they pass that rule of thumb test, well, then
we know we are in fact rubbing shoulders with them,
50

51
00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:45.420
As long as they pass that rule of thumb test, well, then
we know we are in fact rubbing shoulders with them,
51

52
00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.800
and in this case, that means we should target
their unsuspecting Twitter accounts.
52

53
00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.550
So open up a spreadsheet and jot down
any competitors you already know about.
53

54
00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.430
Then just do a bit of googling around for the other ones.
54

55
00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:03.300
Search using words that people might use
to find whatever it is you're working on.
55

56
00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:08.310
You can also try searching for ways that you
would describe your business. If need be,
56

57
00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.870
flash back to the previous lectures in this section
for how you can kind of think through this.
57

58
00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.150
You can also jump in the Slack
and we can all help you out.
58

59
00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:21.510
OK, now that you've got a little list of possible competitors,
take to Google.com and insert the following.
59

60
00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.570
Insert the name of the company,
the competitor you found,
60

61
00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:27.390
plus... yeah, you guessed it, Twitter.
61

62
00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:31.720
If you add these two keywords
together, you'll find their Twitter
62

63
00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:38.460
99.99% of the time. When you find one,
type that competitor's @username
63

64
00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.520
into that spreadsheet next to their name.
64

65
00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.800
You get the username by just looking at the URL, it's
65

66
00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:47.940
generally the last thing you see. Now, once you're done
with that, you can go back to the search.twitter.com,
66

67
00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:48.900
generally the last thing you see. Now, once you're done
with that, you can go back to the search.twitter.com,
67

68
00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.660
but we're going to get more advanced with it this time.
68

69
00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:58.920
Oh, would you look at that, it says "advanced search"
right here. Advanced search on Twitter is, well, more
69

70
00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:02.490
advanced than regular search,
if that wasn't obvious enough.
70

71
00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:07.540
Look down the page slightly and you'll see
a field that says "Mentioning these accounts."
71

72
00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:13.410
This is where we'll be plugging in those competitors'
usernames that we just collected a second ago.
72

73
00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:19.840
I'm just, for example, say, going to type in @ComcastCares,
since it pretty much guarantees that I'll
73

74
00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.850
find some gems in the search results.
74

75
00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:23.170
Hold on for just a second.
75

76
00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:23.780
Don't click "Search" quite yet.
76

77
00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:25.140
Don't click "Search" quite yet.
77

78
00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.150
Let's enhance the search results just a tad bit more.
78

79
00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:31.050
I personally like to change the written language to English.
79

80
00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:31.870
Why?
80

81
00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:36.270
Well, because, like a true American, I don't
speak any other languages whatsoever.
81

82
00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:40.420
With this, you can narrow down the search results to
stuff you'll actually understand by picking whatever
82

83
00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:42.820
language makes sense for your business.
83

84
00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:46.830
For example, let's say we live on the West coast of Ireland.
84

85
00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.320
Well, maybe we want to find some people who speak Irish.
85

86
00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.280
Yeah, that's a language.
86

87
00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:54.160
Can anyone actually guess how
you spell competitor in Irish?
87

88
00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:55.240
I'll give you a second.
88

89
00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:59.260
You could probably guess it,
it's actually pretty easy. Competitor.
89

90
00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:08.650
I-O-M-A-I-T-H-E-O-I-R.
Just sound it out: competitor.
90

91
00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:09.280
Last thing.
91

92
00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:15.290
Scroll to the bottom and select both "negative" and "question",
because those will get us straight to the complainy
92

93
00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:20.080
people that we kind of want to find. Negative just means
tweets that have a negative tone to them, because
93

94
00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:22.090
Twitter can actually search for that,
94

95
00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:29.170
while question means, well, that the person is asking
the account a question, and those questions are often
95

96
00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.980
pretty passive aggressive, often include complaints.
96

97
00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:36.940
Twitter has mountains of data about how people
talk about stuff, and those help filter out all of the
97

98
00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:40.270
positive things people will be tweeting about Comcast,
98

99
00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:42.250
if such a thing even exists.
99

100
00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:44.560
Cool. Now let's see what we find.
100

101
00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:47.530
We can use the people in these
feeds in a couple of different ways.
101

102
00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:54.030
Number one, we can reply directly to the person talking
or complaining and intervene in their conversation,
102

103
00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:55.030
or two, we can send a separate tweet by
@mentioning the specific person who is talking.
103

104
00:06:55.090 --> 00:07:00.860
or two, we can send a separate tweet by
@mentioning the specific person who is talking.
104

105
00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:05.650
The first option can be a little tricky because your
competitor will be able to see that you did it.
105

106
00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:11.140
Now, you really shouldn't be worried that much about
whether or not your competition is going to see it,
106

107
00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:11.610
Now, you really shouldn't be worried that much about
whether or not your competition is going to see it,
107

108
00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:17.890
and if your competition is, say, like a big company,
they're probably not even going to notice this at all or let
108

109
00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:20.430
alone care that you did it.
109

110
00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:26.230
But if you're in one of these information sensitive
situations where you're in stealth mode or you work
110

111
00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:29.030
for a company and your company might notice,
111

112
00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.860
okay, let's try the second technique.
In the second technique,
112

113
00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:37.780
just go with the second option that we mentioned
and @mention the person instead.
113

114
00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:43.780
What this means is that you just start a brand new
tweet with that person, shows up on their news feed,
114

115
00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:46.240
not on Comcast's news feed,
115

116
00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:50.230
and in this case, just write something in
reference to the tweet you found them from.
116

117
00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:55.450
Here are a few examples of things you could write
so you don't come across as that weird stalker-ish
117

118
00:07:55.460 --> 00:08:01.260
sales guy. "@username Couldn't help but notice
your tweet about [such and such] competitor.
118

119
00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:04.090
Check out what I'm working on. I think you'll like it."
119

120
00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:05.920
Or how about another one?
120

121
00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:07.890
"@username I couldn't agree more,
121

122
00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:10.330
[such and such] competitor is ridiculous!
122

123
00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:13.140
That's why we created [insert the name of your product]."
123

124
00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:16.950
You can take really an infinite number
of directions. Whatever you do,
124

125
00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:21.740
just don't say "Try my product" and put a
link to your website, and just leave it like that.
125

126
00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:22.770
just don't say "Try my product" and put a
link to your website, and just leave it like that.
126

127
00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:24.250
You've got to try it a little bit harder.
127

128
00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:29.140
A couple more quick things on competitor searches
on Twitter that could come in handy here and there.
128

129
00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:32.640
Since it's important to respond to tweets
when they are fresh and newly made,
129

130
00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:38.500
it would make sense that, number one, we might not
have a whole lot of tweets to hit right now that qualify
130

131
00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:43.960
as brand new and fresh, and two, they probably
come in sporadically throughout the day.
131

132
00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:48.550
Now, one way of handling this is to use Twitter's embedded
system for saving the searches that have worked out for you.
132

133
00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:49.360
Now, one way of handling this is to use Twitter's embedded
system for saving the searches that have worked out for you.
133

134
00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:52.950
Let's go back to the search we did earlier in this lecture.
134

135
00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:59.050
We can save this search so we can quickly access it later
on by clicking on the "More" dropdown and clicking
135

136
00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.150
"Save this search."
136

137
00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:06.760
Now, you can dip in every once in a while and use the
preset searches that you know will find you people.
137

138
00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:13.150
Lastly, you can use a tool like Mention.com to send
you a notification every time someone mentions
138

139
00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:14.320
one of your competitors.
139

140
00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:19.930
It's sort of like saving a search on Twitter, but
it will send you a notification each time there's
140

141
00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:24.520
a new tweet mentioning whatever the keyword
or whatever the company you're interested in is.
141

142
00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:30.820
Now, I'd definitely not recommend using it if your competitor
is a company as despised as Comcast, because
142

143
00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:33.260
that is just way too many notifications.
143

144
00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:37.580
Okay, on to the next lecture and moving on from Twitter.

145
00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:38.870
Adios muchachos.
