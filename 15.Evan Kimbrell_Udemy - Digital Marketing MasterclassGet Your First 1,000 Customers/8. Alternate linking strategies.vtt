00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.310
Hey guys welcome back to the course.

2
00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:02.710
OK.

3
00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:09.330
Last Lecture we covered the big league tricks you can create a random link in about 45 seconds and you

4
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:15.780
can create a custom link bitterly in about 60 seconds or you can spend maybe an hour and a half in about

5
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.700
15 blocks to create a custom branded domain link which of the three you pick is entirely up to you.

6
00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:28.500
But at the end of the day these links still will always look different so to speak to some people and

7
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.880
in a certain point you might not be able to rely on this trick as heavily.

8
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.400
When we get to things like email marketing or other more advanced long term strategies it'll just start

9
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.250
to look tacky or kind of just wrong.

10
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.040
It looks weird for instance to say hey I can link you direct to the product page I'm talking about here

11
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.820
it is Diddley slash product page for this guy.

12
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.350
Yeah.

13
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.610
It's just not as professional.

14
00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.840
But there are two more things you can do and these For the most part look a little bit better.

15
00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.950
The first thing you can do is add a tag to your real link.

16
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:09.030
So if I wanted to you say track inbound clicks from this course to my web site I'd say go to browse

17
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.130
dot com slash question mark R E F equals 1 2 3.

18
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.630
How exactly does that work.

19
00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.020
Well a surprising amount of people don't know this but web browsers just instinctively know.

20
00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.440
I've known this since they were born that whenever you go to you are out and I have a question mark

21
00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.770
to ignore whatever comes after that question.

22
00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:34.800
Yes when you're on tries to send you a link to a terrible Christmas gift idea from Amazon.

23
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.140
That full paragraph abomination of a link is what I'm talking about.

24
00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.490
Every little word or number after that question mark is all for tracking and doesn't actually do anything

25
00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.050
for you.

26
00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.700
So you can actually just strip it while on the other hand we ourselves can crudely add them as well.

27
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.910
The general style you most commonly see is to put what I said before which is R-E equals just because

28
00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:02.790
it's easier to understand and people are more used to seeing it when they then look at their Google

29
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:08.970
Analytics page you can see that some people went to an Kimberle dot com and some people went to get

30
00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:15.750
another com questionmark more EF 1 2 3 and that's how you know who came from what its where they went

31
00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:16.260
to.

32
00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:22.940
Now obviously the best time to use this link is when you know you can submit a clickable blue link.

33
00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.000
You know those ones you click and you go there as opposed to copying and pasting and put it in your

34
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:34.140
you rollbar if they have to do that copy and paste it still might work but it just it's a little bit

35
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.800
trickier because they have more time to actually look at it and go oh that looks weird.

36
00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.010
But when it's a clickable link people don't think they just click it.

37
00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:46.410
Now some of you are probably asking ever known as the most ultimate the most discreet the most amazing

38
00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.030
way of hiding your links.

39
00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.740
Well I'm here to service you.

40
00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.090
Drumroll.

41
00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:55.770
The best way to actually do it is actually by using HDMI to mask link instead.

42
00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:00.210
You know when you click that blue link that just says here but there's a website called here and you

43
00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.010
click it it takes you to a Web site.

44
00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.750
That's actually what I'm talking about the way you do this is actually pretty simple.

45
00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.730
But of course it's only going to work in areas or places that you can use HVM amount.

46
00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:14.120
So emails and forums are generally good.

47
00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:19.650
Twitter not so much but of course they already do the tracking for you to do this you just have to type

48
00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:28.080
the simplest e-mail tag known to man aligator bracket a space H R E F equals quotation marks and inside

49
00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.570
the quotation marks you put the actual link.

50
00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:33.550
You want them to go to close aligator bracket.

51
00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:39.720
Then you type in whatever you want to display as the link and then you close it off by two aligator

52
00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:45.270
brackets with the backslash and in a way you don't need to understand each time Malad understand how

53
00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.120
what I just said works.

54
00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:52.770
But basically it just uses normal taxed and then wraps it in a link script.

55
00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:58.920
So when you click it it'll go to the link inside of the alligator brackets that are on the left and

56
00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:04.620
the user will only see the text that's in between the two sets of brackets in order to do this check

57
00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.850
and see if the place you're posting allows rich text.

58
00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:14.310
Generally a dead giveaway is if they allow you to put images you might see a button up at the top that

59
00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.660
has those little alligator brackets.

60
00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:20.060
And you probably see that near the other text formatting buttons.

61
00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.820
If that's the case you're in business now in an e-mail.

62
00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:28.680
You can also do this but you have to make sure that whatever system you're using whether it's you know

63
00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:35.430
Gmail or Apple or whatever has it's age TMLC settings turned on if you can't tell whether or not something

64
00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:36.970
will accept HDMI.

65
00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:43.080
I suggest just trying to type it in a lot of times it will recognize it and then post it correctly.

66
00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.270
And worst case scenario it doesn't.

67
00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.420
And then you can usually just delete or edit your comment.

68
00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:53.170
OK so those other four strategies you can use to get more data about your links and see what's working.

69
00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:58.920
You can use link wrappers and shorters you can use custom branded domains you can add link tags but

70
00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:04.340
putting them after the question mark in your link or you can create a hyperlink with each team and just

71
00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.690
flat out hide the link you're sending him to.

72
00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:08.730
You are now a link master.

73
00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:10.250
I'll see you in the next AUCTOR.
