00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:01.790
All right you guys welcome back.

2
00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:06.420
So the last two lectures I talked about white papers what they are what they're usually about and how

3
00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:07.310
to write your own.

4
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:12.420
Plenty of places use them as a lead magnet to get email addresses and info but the people that they

5
00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:13.850
want to start marketing to.

6
00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.370
Well the next I really Magritte I want to discuss this called the ebook and I'm sure you've seen it.

7
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.460
Now e-books are longer written pieces that provide information and best practices for people in a specific

8
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:24.720
field or industry.

9
00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.570
They're usually written in a conversational way almost kind of like writing a blog post but a much longer

10
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.000
one with a lot more info in it to offer.

11
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.770
Their purpose usually is to serve as a resource for people.

12
00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.940
E-books can be downloaded and Re-Read as many times as it takes to step people through a process to

13
00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.940
provide details on how something works or best practices for creating or beginning something.

14
00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.520
For example uber fliped created this e-book called data driven content marketing going through the ebook

15
00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.140
you'll find visuals to help you will realize the process they're talking about steps to take and resources

16
00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.600
to use to make it all work.

17
00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:04.200
It's broad enough that it covers multiple issues the audience might be concerned with but doesn't dive

18
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.810
too deep into each one.

19
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.730
Instead it provides the basics of what you need to know and then just move on.

20
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.450
Of course to access the book you're required to complete a short lead form name email and company.

21
00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.220
Now most e-books have gated access like this requiring you to give up some personal info to get that

22
00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.060
value.

23
00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.200
The question is does the ebook look interesting and valuable enough for you to give up that personal

24
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.030
information and agree to have them start emailing you.

25
00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.000
Now you might wonder what's the difference in e-book and a white paper.

26
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:36.850
Honestly a lot of people even those so-called marketing experts out there wonder the same thing.

27
00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.880
Now the two formats are very similar but a good explanation I've heard and I'd agree with at least is

28
00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.130
that e-books are like the natural evolution of white papers white papers are kind of like these academic

29
00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.390
like formerly written papers on how to solve a problem.

30
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.190
They're mostly tax to usually get printed out and they're very focused what they.

31
00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.430
Here's a problem here's a solution type of format and a lot of times data and research are used to prove

32
00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.940
a point extensively.

33
00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.960
However people today prefer something less tech savvy and formal which is where e-books come in.

34
00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:11.760
Now e-books are usually usually more conversational and they're less steeped in heavy data and research

35
00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.890
to prove points.

36
00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.760
They don't focus as much on a specific problem or issue they usually provide a set of best practices

37
00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:18.960
based on today's trends.

38
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:24.900
For someone in a specific field or industry e-books usually provide more resources and are usually longer

39
00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.990
than a white paper maybe 20 to 30 pages maybe 50.

40
00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.070
Sometimes you see him over 100 but it's a more rare.

41
00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:38.040
But while you could print them out e-books are usually designed and best viewed on a laptop or mobile

42
00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.490
device.

43
00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:39.970
Hence the e-book part.

44
00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.460
So before we go any further why exactly do we create e-books.

45
00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.060
Well they have some nice benefits if you're trying to generate leads.

46
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.150
E-books can help you establish your expertise on a specific topic.

47
00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.660
Being able to offer a collection of information tips and resources and one big document takes focus

48
00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.680
and effort that plenty of other places simply don't have.

49
00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.090
Good example you x pen.

50
00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:08.480
They have a full stack user experience design platform that allows you to wireframe then prototype then.

51
00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.830
It's kind of simulate a real app.

52
00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:16.530
They've also written and publish an e-book called How to launch your X user experience career and get

53
00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:17.310
paid.

54
00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.890
So not only do they provide a great tool you ex-pros can use but they're also sharing advice for those

55
00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.030
same people.

56
00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:28.410
It's a way to establish trust and show they know what exactly they're talking about.

57
00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:34.010
E-books often have a lot of visuals making them engaging and generally fun to read fine or a word

58
00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:42.230
so if you have design skills or if you've already got an info graphic or an intro graphic type content

59
00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.770
that you want to use Well pretty easy to reformat that into an e-book.

60
00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.520
Now e-books can also help you reuse popular stuff you've written before.

61
00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.960
For example if you got great feedback in a series of blog posts about how to do a swift app development

62
00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:59.090
for example well you could take the best parts of those posts add some new material and then kind of

63
00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:05.610
shape it into let's say the beginner's guide to with app development or a similar kind of ebook.

64
00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:11.090
On the flip side since e-books can be densely packed with good stuff you could use pieces of it and

65
00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:16.730
new blog posts or social media posts at the same time promote the e-book if you like this post on email

66
00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:17.810

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:23.150
Check out our e-book on how to use automation to define and improve your overall email strategy.

68
00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:28.400
Put that into your blog that's a great way to convert casual watchers into people who give you their

69
00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.960
email.

70
00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:30.790
In general one piece helps the other.

71
00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.390
And of course e-books can be awesome at generating leads.

72
00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:37.670
If you've got an interesting topic or promis helpful tips to help people create better websites or be

73
00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:43.100
better at data analysis for example well they'd be probably more than willing to sign up for your emails

74
00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:44.110
to get that.

75
00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.550
So those reasons create e-books and if you're ready to learn how.

76
00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:49.790
Check out the next apps and the next lecture.

77
00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:50.630
