00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,060
Hey guys welcome back to the course.

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:06,990
Now we're cruising through the U.S. recourse here and in our last lecture we talked about some design

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:10,190
and technical aspects of a website that can affect SBO.

4
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:13,980
I wanted to give you a couple more ideas to consider in this lecture specifically about how your site

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:18,690
structure and links can affect ASIO's as well now as we mentioned in our lectures about writing content

6
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:24,570
adding links within our pages can improve SEO links direct users and help Google discover the relationships

7
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:29,670
between our pages and then pass on SEO value to pages beyond our site.

8
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:34,520
When you add a link to your page try to use those important keywords in links if possible.

9
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:38,540
I obviously overstuff links with all your keywords but try to keep it simple.

10
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:43,500
For example if you're going to link to a post you did about ways to improve Web site security then the

11
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,860
link itself should either match the title of the page you're going to or include the important keywords

12
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:49,470
about it.

13
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:50,890
Now you might write something like this.

14
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:54,250
My recent post about how to improve Web site security I mentioned.

15
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:58,850
So the how to improve Web site security part is the link.

16
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:04,800
The relevant keywords would be web site security or improve Web site security or even the entire phrase

17
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:10,290
making a link helps Google understand the page relinking to is about what we wrote about in the link

18
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:12,970
or at least that it's you know a reason expectation.

19
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:17,910
Now on the other hand try to avoid creating links that have meaningless text in them like click here

20
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:19,430
or like this.

21
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:22,360
There are plenty of people who write up text like this.

22
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:26,910
If you're looking for a great tutorial on frying a turkey track this out.

23
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:30,200
Now obviously search for frying a turkey but I think that makes the point.

24
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,190
Now check this out does nothing describe what the page is about.

25
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:35,300
You're actually forced to read the text beforehand.

26
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:39,690
Basically what that does is it Google looks at it and thinks that you might actually be tricking your

27
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:43,130
customer or your users into clicking on something they might not want to.

28
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,090
In this case you get the wrong way.

29
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:50,580
You're not really helping Google understand why the link is important or helping it to understand how

30
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:52,580
it links to your important keywords.

31
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:57,350
Link text should be considered the same way you think of text on say like a sign or a door.

32
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:03,450
You're having a garage sale you want to buy a sign that's a garage sale not a sign that says over here

33
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,620
one of those signs as actual meaning.

34
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:11,340
The other doesn't newsier link TX wisely to make sure the value gets passed accurately to the pager

35
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:12,220
linking to.

36
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:18,150
Now a quick aside here there might be times when you don't want to pass on SU value to a link that appears

37
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:18,890
on your pages.

38
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:24,210
For example the support comments or other user generated content or anyone can visit your page and post

39
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:25,460
something like a link.

40
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,520
Well you don't actually need to protect yourself.

41
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:32,380
Spammers seek out pages like this and they can post links to their sites and then try to generate some

42
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,230
black hat SEO magic.

43
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:39,210
The best way to counteract this nonsense is actually just to add what are called no follow attributes

44
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:41,470
inside any user generated links.

45
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:43,350
Now that code basically looks like this.

46
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:46,710
Inside the h r f part of the link.

47
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:52,650
All you have to do is just add RDL equal equals no follow but I did get a new follow attribute to any

48
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:52,950
link.

49
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:54,250
The user as well.

50
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:59,040
It keeps spammers from getting any value and it keeps your site clean and the eyes of Google knows is

51
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:04,380
why for instance if you make a comment on youtube and link back to your site that doesn't count because

52
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:08,320
every time you do that YouTube automatically will put a no follow on.

53
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:13,380
Fact in most situations where you can submit something like user generated show up you're not going

54
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:14,280
to get a link back.

55
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,830
OK well proper link structure is good practice.

56
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:21,860
You should also consider how links to your site look specifically the URLs to your pages.

57
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:27,150
Google has a few recommendations for you or you or else or refer to the architecture of your site.

58
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:29,570
First of all Google Crawl's pages on Web sites.

59
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:32,480
It doesn't always crawl all of the pages.

60
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:38,130
Depends how big the site is and how complex the directory structure is worse than say a thousand pages

61
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:38,660
on your site.

62
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:41,340
You probably don't have to worry about pages not getting crawled.

63
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:46,590
But if you've a bigger site or anticipate getting into the thousands of pages and beyond proper structure

64
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:48,690
will help ensure your site gets indexed.

65
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:52,670
I help to start by planning out a logical site structure something that's clear.

66
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:58,200
If you were to look at either a map of your pages or the you are Elle's of each one a general rule of

67
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:02,720
thumb is that if you can look at a you RL and understand it that's generally good.

68
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:10,050
Something like web site dot com slash news site slash object equals queue equals 3 4 3 6 7 1 is a complete

69
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:16,020
mystery but you can look at say what's I dot com slash recipes slash sesame chicken and understand what

70
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:19,500
you're getting now RUBINGH or content the categories can also help SBO.

71
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:25,230
But you have to keep it to a lower number like 2 to 6 main categories of conta.

72
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:28,790
Ideally your website navigation should mirror this grouping.

73
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:34,180
Let's see a five main categories of blog post or content or whatever for an app web site.

74
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:38,710
Maybe you'd have about features updates download and help.

75
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:44,310
OK then it makes sense if your main menu showed those main categories as the links at the top of each

76
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:44,760
page.

77
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,320
That's just logical structure.

78
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:47,300
Google looks for that.

79
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:52,320
It also helps keep your web site shallow or in other words you can't go more than three or four levels

80
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:54,150
deep from the home page.

81
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:59,060
So if your Web site you are all started to look like this well it could be bad for you like web site

82
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:04,530
dot com your site specials slash filtered by date slash optional slash you kind of get the point.

83
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:09,790
Now that's not a logical structure and not one that Google or any user would really like.

84
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:14,290
But the one thing Google definitely does like is getting some help understanding how your site is structured

85
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,450
and axen else sitemap is one way to help.

86
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:23,560
Now SML site map is basically a list of all of you are all on your Web site written in the code called

87
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,010
SML which is easy for browsers to read.

88
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:28,590
You also tell Google which pages are priorities on your site.

89
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,930
How recently they've been updated and their useful info for browsers.

90
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:36,430
You create this file and make it available to Google so you can easily and more quickly index your site

91
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:37,770
for sites just starting out.

92
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:40,390
This really actually could help boost your rankings more quickly.

93
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:45,180
So how exactly can you create one of these magical Exham site maps and submit it to Google.

94
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,640
Well it's really easy actually and just use a free tool.

95
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,810
Here's one is called SML Eldar site Knops dot com.

96
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:51,630
And then as a test.

97
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:55,330
Well I created an X Mail site not for this store that sells thin wallets.

98
00:05:55,390 --> 00:06:00,010
I submitted you will all the directions that it took a couple minutes but that generated a site with

99
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:05,450
160 pages and it did what I can do is jump into google search con. And there is a section for your Web

100
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:11,470
site called Krol OK and there's a spot for site maps where you can test the sitemap you created and

101
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:12,260
then upload it.

102
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:17,860
By doing this you can speed up the process by which Google Crawl's your site and maybe actually up your

103
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:18,400
rankings.

104
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:23,080
So those are some ideas to consider for links and site structure both can benefit Osseo so remember

105
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:28,240
to create an easy to follow site structure and create a site map to help out the googlebot.

106
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,140
All right guys that's it for now I'll see you in the next lecture.
