00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.770
Hey guys welcome back to the chorus so in our last lecture we talked about the first step in our process

2
00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.710
of getting press coverage and it's finding reporters.

3
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:13.680
Now we want to dig into that list that we made of 10 to 15 outlets and then reporters and started understand

4
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.450
more about each lead we identified.

5
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.850
Now these people are journalists bloggers and writers with different interests and areas of focus.

6
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.110
We need to do some research so we know which leads are the best ones to reach out to when we have something

7
00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:25.960
to pitch that.

8
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.810
So step two of our process of getting coverage is to research and compile the interests of the people

9
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.020
on our list.

10
00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.870
And that's what this lecture is all about.

11
00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.610
So let's jump in here.

12
00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.750
We've got our spreadsheet from The Last Lecture.

13
00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:43.230
It's a list of eight to 10 or if you more crazy 10 15 names on here from our Web sites and blogs we

14
00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.400
first identified.

15
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.760
Let's do some research and learn more about these reporters and writers.

16
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.800
So one thing we can do to learn about each person that makes a ton of sense is to read their articles.

17
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.190
Wow shocker I know right.

18
00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:55.980
Tell it topic's did they generally write about.

19
00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:02.360
Do they have any opinions about an industry trend or any other types of products playing to those opinions.

20
00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.130
It's a great way to get in and actually get a good pitch and get their attention.

21
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.630
Make a list of topics and add it to your spreadsheet.

22
00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.770
These topics can help create a scope you can stay within.

23
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.360
You go outside the scope chances are they won't be interested.

24
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.650
In some cases you might find some articles that are right on the money pieces I've written that really

25
00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.980
relate well to your product business or interest.

26
00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.390
Make note of those because while you'll be able to reference them later when you email them.

27
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.770
All right so for example in my research and the previous lecture we're searching for reporters.

28
00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.570
Let's say I came across another iPhone accessory blog search result like this one.

29
00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:42.120
IPhone Life magazine mouthfull specifically I identify this author Mike Riley as a potential lead who

30
00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.770
can be interested in my tech invention.

31
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.550
He writes about similar iPhone related accessories so I added him to my list.

32
00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:52.410
So here on his page of posts from the iPhone Life magazine website I can quickly skim and see which

33
00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:54.210
topics he writes about most.

34
00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.480
He's written about devices and accessories you can use with your iPhone.

35
00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:03.570
Things you can put around your home like speakers some wearables health related accessories and games.

36
00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.890
OK.

37
00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.130
Well there's a bunch topics right there and I can list them in my spreadsheet because I might list out

38
00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.350
wearables health games home things like that.

39
00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.570
The fact he writes wearables gives me some hope for my wearable iPhone invention.

40
00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.100
So this is a good start.

41
00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:22.080
Repeat this process for each person on your list and you might see some overlap or some unique topics

42
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.700
come up.

43
00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:23.390
OK.

44
00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.630
Another thing you can do to research or leads is to check out their social feeds.

45
00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.350
Now what did they actually post about.

46
00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:29.490
What do they share.

47
00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:34.000
You can go to Twitter and check out their replies feed on Twitter to see what responses or advice they've

48
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.110
been offering to people.

49
00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:40.380
That's generally a better way of getting a pulse of what they think than looking at their official feed.

50
00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.860
Now if you go to Twitter I don't even notice this but you have your regular feed and that's the things

51
00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.810
that they post just to everyone.

52
00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.430
And then you go to the replies and all then well you can see what they reply to other people and that's

53
00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:56.430
usually them just talking versus the other ones which are literally they're often more prepared.

54
00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:57.660
You usually get less out of them.

55
00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.420
Look for more social profiles through Google for example.

56
00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.380
Remember in our last lecture we found a guy with the name of Jessie Hollington who's a senior editor

57
00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:05.320
at Ice Lounge.

58
00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:10.370
Now this is because we invented a selfie or an iPhone holder for your head whatever.

59
00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.640
You know we have a techie kind of invention for iPhones and in our search we found Mr. Hollington here.

60
00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.440
Well if we want to know more about him beyond his articles Let's check out his social feeds.

61
00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.210
Some writers have a site where they list out all their social accounts.

62
00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.310
But if you have to google and just do something like that.

63
00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:32.630
Jesse Hollington I'll count or you can use Google trickery put site Colan I allowed dot com.

64
00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.690
Jesse Hollington and that what that does is it restricts the search only to that Web site.

65
00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:37.610
And if you just did that.

66
00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:38.340
Well there you go.

67
00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:39.180
Really not that hard.

68
00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.100
There is Twitter.

69
00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.310
Here is is Corra.

70
00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:42.230
And here's is link.

71
00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:45.960
Now this gives us a couple of sites to go to to see what interest he has.

72
00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:50.580
By the way when you find these reporters social accounts connect to them immediately it's a good way

73
00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:51.470
to keep track of them.

74
00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.400
And if you connect now you won't forget to do it later.

75
00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.560
But also some of them will follow you right back so no questions asked.

76
00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:03.080
So people are just like that if that happens on a platform like Twitter then you can message them privately.

77
00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.080
And it's a nice option to have if they're active on the platform so we can keep that in mind for later

78
00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.250
when we actually take the step of reaching out to them.

79
00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:13.800
OK one more thing that can help us get to know these reporters and writers is to check out their social

80
00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:14.450
profiles.

81
00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:16.920
How do they describe themselves what's in their bias.

82
00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:21.870
Sometimes it Biles they write for themselves provide some obvious cues about what they do and what they

83
00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:22.430
like.

84
00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.680
You might also see some off topic discussion points you can use to make an impression.

85
00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:31.950
Now maybe you see one blogger likes the same sports team as you or you might live in the same area if

86
00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:35.390
some of these people are local Maybe there's a chance you can meet them in person.

87
00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.780
You know I Arel in real life meeting them face to face at a local tech event for example gives them

88
00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.570
a chance to pitch them immediately.

89
00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.380
I I'm actually kidding don't do that.

90
00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.660
Meeting them allows you to just meet them.

91
00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.210
Remember these are real people so introduce yourself.

92
00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.300
Get to know them and just don't go immediately to the hard sell.

93
00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:57.810
Maybe exchange contact info whatever the point is that if it's in person or it's there an e-mail or

94
00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:02.220
you're tweeting with them or retreating for getting their attention or direct messaging the whole idea

95
00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:03.770
is to get their attention.

96
00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:04.110
Right.

97
00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:10.050
So later on you pitch them you're not a complete random right if they already know who you are they've

98
00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:15.180
heard of you they've actually recognized your name dramatically increases the chance of them actually

99
00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:16.780
being willing to cover you.

100
00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.640
Now this process takes time unfortunately is not something that works overnight.

101
00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:26.730
Once you find a list of targets you kind of have to stalk them and you have to do it usually for a decently

102
00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:28.290
long period of time.

103
00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:33.990
A lot of people out there that do PR think of things in terms of quarterly cycles and some of them and

104
00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:36.420
think of things like yearly cycles.

105
00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:42.060
So if they start stocking someone now well expect to start getting in with them or at least getting

106
00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:45.780
to the point where you know if they're going to cover you around six to nine months later.

107
00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:51.060
Now those are obviously professionals like we don't have to do that mound of it for doing it ourselves

108
00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:52.020
DIY style.

109
00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:56.930
You know maybe you just do this on and off for a couple weeks and then use that to kind of inform yourself

110
00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:57.550
going forward.

111
00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:03.270
Usually it's like a month is a pretty good period of time to actually do this just kind of on the side.

112
00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:03.480
All right.

113
00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:04.970
Maybe this makes sense maybe it doesn't.

114
00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:08.790
Anyway do your basic research and figure out what they like what they covered.

115
00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:14.700
Find their social profiles that will open up a whole can of different things that you can go off of

116
00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:20.130
opinions they have quirks they might have where they live where they're going to hang out what events

117
00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:23.460
they're going to etc. and then just keep doing it for each person on your list.

118
00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:28.170
Personally I like to take shorthand notes on the side so I know some of the things that stuck out to

119
00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:31.860
me like you just never forget them because too many people on your list they shouldn't take too long.

120
00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:36.330
Just go step by step and your spreadsheet will begin to fill up with more great detail you'll need as

121
00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:37.440
we move forward.

122
00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:40.030
Now speaking of moving forward now don't this step.

123
00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:41.570
I'll see you guys in the next one.
