00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.310
All right guys welcome back to the chorus.

2
00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:07.510
We are neck deep in Facebook ads right now going through the process of setting up a campaign.

3
00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:10.050
So we're going to continue where we left off in the last lecture.

4
00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:15.850
That was in the middle of creating a campaign where we just completed the ads section to finding our

5
00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:21.550
audience budget and duration by completing that section that moves us on to the ad section.

6
00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.910
Now this is where we can create ads for our campaign.

7
00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.610
And what this lecture will be about.

8
00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:32.050
So the ad said in the ad section both correspond to the objective which shows at the very beginning

9
00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:37.840
in each section it'll show settings and attributes that relate the goal we have in mind in our example.

10
00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:43.060
We said we wanted to drive traffic to our website so we chose the traffic objective.

11
00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.400
So in the ads we saw specific settings for that goal.

12
00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.430
Now we're going to see specific options for ads for that goes well in the end section.

13
00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.190
Here are some of the options you might see.

14
00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:54.270
We have pages.

15
00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:59.770
Now you might be asked to connect this ad to the appropriate Facebook page and perhaps even an Instagram

16
00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.150
account if you have that.

17
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.540
Just pick the right ones.

18
00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:08.980
Obviously for your situation there is a format Well you can choose what your ad will look like from

19
00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:10.600
a variety of different formats.

20
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.950
Now Facebook offers things like a saw images video and more.

21
00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.370
My advice for your first AD and ours here is really just to keep it simple for now.

22
00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.220
You can test that stuff later but it's not something worth doing right out of the box.

23
00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:25.320
Instead just go with the single image.

24
00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:28.170
Then we can learn how to create ads and see how it works.

25
00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.290
And then you can kind of go back get more advanced.

26
00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.670
Now we'll pick that image in one of the settings that's actually coming up.

27
00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:39.670
Now first I want to mention full screen experience which shows a full screen ad on mobile if used or

28
00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.710
stepped through it pretty fast.

29
00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:48.030
You can see it because it's actually kind of cool if you know for sure that you want a mobile ad experience.

30
00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:54.070
You check off a full screen canvas and then choose one of the three templates now to get new customers

31
00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.050
want is something we can obviously try out.

32
00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:01.960
So you choose that and then start filling in the blanks like for our service maybe we offer rides to

33
00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:03.240
the football game.

34
00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.130
Need a ride to the 49ers game if you're in San Francisco.

35
00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.540
We'll start with that headline and then we'll type in we'll pick you up drive you to the game and then

36
00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:11.280
drive you home.

37
00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:12.820
All for one low price.

38
00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.750
So basically it's like Uber for football.

39
00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:20.720
If we replace the generic pictures here with more football the type ones then we can preview our ad

40
00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:21.420
on the phone.

41
00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:27.280
Click preview for mobile at the bottom and Facebook will send you a notification on your phone where

42
00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:33.160
you can actually preview the pretty nice again if you know for sure you want a mobile ad experience.

43
00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.000
In general I don't I strongly suggest you play around with this later when you get more advanced.

44
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.720
Now images is in another section and the ads set up specifically for uploading or choosing the images

45
00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.020
you'll use in your ad depending on your format.

46
00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.480
You might need one image or many of them it's best to add your own.

47
00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.570
And the recommended specs are over on the right.

48
00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:57.400
So make sure you upload something that actually will look attractive and not the wrong resolution.

49
00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.650
It will look bad if it gets through but usually they don't even approve those.

50
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.220
But if you're feeling cheaper lazy or just not creative at all.

51
00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.200
Facebook actually has some free stock photos you can use.

52
00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.580
Don't obviously suggest it but if you really really want to just try this out go for it.

53
00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.390
So if I type in football Well hey here's a few here I can use for free in my apt.

54
00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.690
Here's one with a football player on the field that looks right this looks decent.

55
00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:19.830
We'll use this as an example.

56
00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:25.240
Now links is another section you might have to set especially if you're driving people some place in

57
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.000
particular.

58
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.820
Now in this case I want to push them to a u r l where they can learn more about the services I provide

59
00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.230
or perhaps sign up for a free trial.

60
00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:38.610
This is where you'd enter the trial of your super awesome landing page putting your home page are l

61
00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:44.170
just drops people in the front door but a landing page built with this ad in mind will actually improve

62
00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:49.120
the chances of getting that subsequent sign up or sale again relates back to that concept we talked

63
00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.610
about before called conversion set.

64
00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:54.790
Now you probably already noticed that here in the Links section is where you actually see the preview

65
00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.540
of the ads you've been planning this whole time Hooray.

66
00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:02.680
Finally something pretty to look at now by default you might see the ad in its desktop news feed version

67
00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:08.660
but there are actually other versions of it that you can choose from the pull down the thread of preview.

68
00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.880
This is useful because each format is different and different parts of the ad might get emphasized a

69
00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.160
little bit differently in each case.

70
00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:16.540
You'll see what I mean here in a second.

71
00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:21.700
Now next to preview is where you can type in your headline and text and in the case of our football

72
00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:22.930
uber type service.

73
00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.890
This is not my try.

74
00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:24.130
All right.

75
00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.060
Need a ride to the 49ers game.

76
00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:30.010
We'll pick you up drive you to the game and drive you home all for one low price.

77
00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.170
Looks like it actually fit.

78
00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.770
Now you also get to choose the call to action which can be a button or link people click or tap and

79
00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:40.120
again kind of just depends on the format and the desktop news feed version.

80
00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.840
The button is in the lower right.

81
00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:47.100
But if you switch to you say the Instagram version now the action appears under the image to the left.

82
00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:49.970
So you want to choose the called Action label wisely.

83
00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.480
Just pick whatever relates directly to what you want them to do.

84
00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:58.220
For me I think book now could potentially make sense though.

85
00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.840
Learn more is also a pretty good catch all.

86
00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:03.000
It doesn't always have to be by now.

87
00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.470
In fact if you use by now and then you go to a page where they do buy it.

88
00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:08.670
You call it a book.

89
00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:13.160
Then you will have a massive drop off in conversions so choose them appropriately.

90
00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:19.120
Now one more thing here in the link setting you might notice there's an advanced options section.

91
00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:23.960
Give it a look because a few things might come up as you're creating your at when you enter that you

92
00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:29.210
are at the preview for the desktop news feed version of the ad might pull some text from the page and

93
00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:30.060
put it on the ad.

94
00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:35.330
Most likely the text description under the headline for some reason that text is not a good match for

95
00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:38.150
the well you can override it and type in your own.

96
00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:42.800
Now this makes sense if instead of just duplicate the text you want to appear above the image or if

97
00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.860
it's pulling like a blog post description or who knows what.

98
00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:51.800
So under advanced options start typing in the news feed link description and enter your own text and

99
00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.840
you'll see it reflected in the preview.

100
00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:59.630
Now you could also replace the R L that appears in the ad with a display only you are all kind of similar

101
00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:00.650
to what we did with Google.

102
00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:03.790
Like for instance you know if your landing page shows up with a really weird you are.

103
00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:06.680
Well you probably want to just replace it with your main domain.

104
00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:10.930
So where it says display link I just had to type in Forty-Niners park or dot com.

105
00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:13.120
I don't actually own that domain but to be kind of sweet.

106
00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:15.340
Now this pretty much does it for my ADD set up.

107
00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:19.940
But keep in mind that if you chose a different objective at the beginning the ads set up would be slightly

108
00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:23.760
different like that which is the driving gauge mount and get more page likes.

109
00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:30.170
Well you'd see options for ad format images but then text instead of links because while you're driving

110
00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:33.550
them to a Facebook page instead of an outside you RL.

111
00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.300
So no links are actually required.

112
00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:40.400
So once you finish your work on your ad make sure to go through those different ad previews to see what

113
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:41.960
it looks like in different formats.

114
00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:46.160
You might spot ways where you can improve the text or image but generally you'll see that they're pretty

115
00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.640
much the same when you're good to go at the place order button at the bottom.

116
00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:54.710
And when they go on your Facebook advertiser Now one more thing I'd say before you that place order

117
00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:58.550
is you can preview all the different types of formats but it doesn't mean that you should advertise

118
00:06:58.550 --> 00:06:59.870
on every single format.

119
00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:05.480
Some ads will work in certain formats and just not on others.

120
00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:10.010
Now it used to be the case way back when when Facebook's first started advertising they didn't have

121
00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:14.920
news feed ads they had those right column ads or they show on the side.

122
00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:16.180
That's actually an option now.

123
00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:21.110
You can still use those however like one thing they need to know is that the click through rates for

124
00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:23.120
those have absolutely plummeted.

125
00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:25.310
They're just absolutely atrocious.

126
00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:30.720
And I'm not even sure which companies can make those side column advertising advertisements work.

127
00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:36.050
So what you could do if you're just testing the waters is try everything and then just see but just

128
00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:41.210
know in advance that certain formats are just going to have certain they're just going to have different

129
00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:42.230
outcomes.

130
00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:47.540
Also worth pointing out if you have something that you want someone to buy or the page they're going

131
00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:53.420
to is kind of involved they need to type a lot of stuff and mobile ads generally don't work very well.

132
00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:58.130
Mobile Ads really work when they're going some are simple with only to click on one thing.

133
00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:03.530
People are just much much less less likely on their phone to fill out a form or to go through like the

134
00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:07.400
purchasing and putting the credit card and all that then that all that really remains at this point

135
00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:12.110
is to figure out how did our ad work and specifically did our split test work.

136
00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:13.150
Which one did better.

137
00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:15.320
Now my first advice is just give this some time.

138
00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:19.970
Facebook Ads need at least a day or so to gain enough viewers and results for you to make an educated

139
00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:21.430
guess about how it's going.

140
00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:26.840
And if you tell Facebook to tell you when a winning ad in your foot This can be determined well you'll

141
00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:28.360
actually just get a notification about it.

142
00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:30.210
So obviously you don't have to wait for that one.

143
00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:32.270
But if you want to look at the numbers yourself here's a look.

144
00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:38.390
So under ads manager look at the campaigns tab of the main dashboard you should see your campaign running

145
00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:41.320
there with a pretty green like Circle right next to it.

146
00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:42.630
And that means it's active.

147
00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:47.680
And if that's the case well you should see numbers in the row under each column.

148
00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:52.940
Now based on the original objective you chose for the campaign you should see a label there under the

149
00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:58.800
results column showing X number of links clicked or X number of pages like for example.

150
00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:00.050
Well that number is a good one.

151
00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:01.330
Think of it financially.

152
00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:07.580
How much did those clicks or likes cost look further over to the right and you'll see a number for cost

153
00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:08.810
per result.

154
00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:13.560
Now this is basically how efficient your ad was at achieving your goal in terms of the money you spent.

155
00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:18.220
The lower the cost the better for you when you do find an ad that performs better than another.

156
00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:22.670
It's smart to keep running it and if possible obviously tested against other versions to see if you

157
00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:23.830
can improve on it anymore.

158
00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:29.120
Just wanted to get in the habit of running split tests frequently so you'll always be able to find new

159
00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:32.990
ways of saving yourself money or getting better outcomes as you advertise.

00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:36.890
Related to this point if you're seeing an obvious loser in your ads if you're a few days while it makes

161
00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:38.650
sense to turn off don't waste your money.

162
00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:44.240
If something is obviously not working and at a certain point there's no benefit to getting the data

163
00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:44.880
from it.

164
00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:45.950
You've already learned a lesson.

165
00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:47.860
So make note of what failed and just move on.

166
00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:48.220
OK.

167
00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:49.150
Well there you go.

168
00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:52.310
Facebook adhesive is freely pretty user friendly.

169
00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:53.990
It's certainly more than add words.

170
00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:59.730
In my opinion and with all the tweaking you can do with audience set up unsplit testing keep yourself

171
00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:06.240
busy running campaigns invest some time in it on a regular schedule run tasks and you should see some

172
00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:08.320
results for whatever goal you have in mind.
