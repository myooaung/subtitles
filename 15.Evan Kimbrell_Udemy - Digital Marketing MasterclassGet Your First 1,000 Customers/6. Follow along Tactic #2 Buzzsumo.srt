00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:06,220
Hey guys welcome back to the course so this lecture we're going to go over the following four.

2
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:11,830
Number two how to come up with content ideas based off of our handy dandy tool bus sumo.

3
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:18,510
So here is both sumo looks pretty much like you expect it to look like.

4
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:21,850
So for this one you don't really have to get too tricky with it.

5
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:23,470
It's just going to tell you what's popular.

6
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:30,240
And then based on what's popular then you can just take a second and look at some of the posts see which

7
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:36,320
ones are good content see which ones are showing up often kind of go from there.

8
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:42,210
So one thing I could do is let's say we were talking about my one day MVP course and I wanted to write

9
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:45,600
about in the piece which is actually very common like that's a big thing that I cover.

10
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,890
I get asked to do workshops and talks on NVP and stuff like that so I say NVP OK.

11
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:53,880
And so this I probably should know this one is going to happen.

12
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:58,230
MVP often gets confused with most valuable player.

13
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:00,710
So maybe not what we want to look for.

14
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:00,990
OK.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,780
So I suppose doing the search search for lead in MVP.

16
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:06,270
OK.

17
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:10,990
So here we have a list of things that lead in the piece.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,710
So if we look over here just to get a general kind of barometer of what's popular What did.

19
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:20,790
Well let's take this one did well and the other ones aren't really being touched on.

20
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:25,440
But you know I mean just looking at this I can even just hand looking at the titles I can come up with

21
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:30,590
some ideas for what I can write about the soul of lean startup is not in the.

22
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:31,050
OK.

23
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:36,000
Well I think you're right about what the soul of the Lean Startup really is or I could make an argument

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:43,590
saying it is the NVP or what the main point of lean was and how it relates to NBP is this is a post

25
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:46,320
I would imagine would be also pretty popular I could do something like that.

26
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:51,090
I could make my own NBP I could say how to make an entity based on this idea and I could just do a post

27
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:58,440
you know if you guys are on my MVP course I make in the piece on in the course so I can do that as well.

28
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:04,650
But just Instead make a text version where we actually show what I did see.

29
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:09,490
And then this last this is the one that actually looks somewhat popular and I've checked it out before.

30
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:12,900
So on Hacker News is kind of like a medium.

31
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:18,090
I think it is actually a medium company that writes on medium.

32
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:23,010
So what they're saying is the NBP is dead long live the rot which is the riskiest assumption test.

33
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:29,550
So this guy is doing is essentially trying to make a really like out there statement get people's attention.

34
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:34,830
And you know this is something we talked about we will talk about later is a very common headline tactic

35
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:39,050
saying like this is dead or this is the new blank.

36
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:40,390
So he's doing that.

37
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,900
And it's clearly worked.

38
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:43,660
But have you actually look at his post.

39
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:46,020
It's it's pretty bare bones.

40
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,510
I mean that was literally it probably a page probably 500 words in his blog post.

41
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:52,220
OK.

42
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:54,350
So I don't think he really did that great of a job.

43
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:59,160
Personally I think this is kind of stupid because he doesn't understand what risky is the assumption

44
00:02:59,160 --> 00:02:59,880
test is.

45
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:05,990
That's actually part of the MVP experiment process when you do an MVP experiment.

46
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:11,670
The first thing you'll do is build your riskiest assumption tests which are essentially what build up

47
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:13,050
to your MVP.

48
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:17,730
So what I could do is I could write a blog replying to this basically saying the rat is stupid and you

49
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:23,430
don't understand or you're talking about or I could just say this is a term clearly people is trying

50
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:26,720
to make it thing maybe people are searching for it or maybe people were searching for this.

51
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:32,460
I could make a post about risk assumption tests OK that would be pretty easy I just go over examples

52
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,700
and explain what they are.

53
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:36,420
Let's see what else can we do.

54
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:41,580
I can also just look for let's say lean startup so we have Harvard Business Review talking about problem

55
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:44,700
solvers get to help big companies act like lean startups.

56
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:48,600
That's funny because that's kind of the opposite of lean right lean.

57
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:53,790
It's about removing people and having people do more in less time.

58
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:58,280
So I don't really understand how you can add a pile of people and make it more lean.

59
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:03,380
So whatever I could I could talk about that can be kind of funny to write something talking about how

60
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:06,290
Harvard Business Review doesn't understand the lean startup.

61
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,990
This one I thought was really funny.

62
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:14,830
So I got her juice Suro they raised $30 billion to make a juicing box like a juice machine.

63
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:16,240
And it was $450.

64
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:21,660
And as it turns out the device itself isn't even necessary.

65
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:24,160
So they sell these packets of juice.

66
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,610
And people are figuring out they don't even need to the machine.

67
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:31,170
They can just squeeze the the boxes of juice with their hand and does the same thing.

68
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,690
So I was actually kind of a controversy.

69
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:37,420
So I think this is actually pretty funny and I've seen this post before and it's really good.

70
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,300
So what they did is they took this $450 juicer and broke it down.

71
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:45,900
Trying to figure out why are they charging so much and why is it so important why do these people spend

72
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,640
two years developing this.

73
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,490
I think this is a fascinating post and I would love to do something similar.

74
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:53,330
So you know it's something I can do similar to this.

75
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:57,990
Well I could just look for companies that are not doing well or companies that are controversial.

76
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:04,130
You know if this was a a year ago I could do it on Thera noce really just look for big companies that

77
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:10,910
are raising a lot of money that are bulky and having bad press and they kind of break down like one

78
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:13,200
angle of why it's not working for them.

79
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:15,290
Why is their product so bad.

80
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,450
It's also really interesting.

81
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:19,120
You feel like Kickstarter is a really popular kid.

82
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:27,890
He's like the coolest the coolest Is that cool or that is the most funded Kickstarter ever having doing

83
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:33,380
that and like breaking it down trying to see why for instance the coolest is not profitable.

84
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:36,590
Like they can't sell their coolers for what they sold them for.

85
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:38,600
So I think that's a pretty good idea.

86
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:41,220
Let's see the things that I've been doing more than transforming business.

87
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,650
It's changing the world.

88
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:47,870
All right well you know that's another angle it's like try to take these startup ideas and then try

89
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:50,250
to investigate see if you can find patterns elsewhere.

90
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:56,420
Maybe there's someone out there that is using lean ish tactics and you could kind of say like oh look

91
00:05:56,570 --> 00:06:01,460
this is something that's in startup world but it's also somewhere else that's someone interesting than

92
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:04,750
the rest of it's kind of just going over like programs that don't get a lot of coverage.

93
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:09,110
So I really wanted to get an incubator and see what interesting programs they have and write about it

94
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:11,130
and do my opinion piece.

95
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:13,660
Anti-elite startups are back.

96
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:19,940
It might be interesting anyway so just from doing this like I've come up with like four or five different

97
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:20,820
ideas.

98
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:26,540
So a lot of things I do I mean you can do posts that are reactions to things you disagree with or you

99
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:34,280
could just use the similar format like this one or you could just give you an idea of what people actually

100
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,640
care about what's actually popular like all these.

101
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:38,600
Not a lot of interest.

102
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:44,030
It might cut obviously because they're from larger outlets but in general I mean it shows that people

103
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:45,280
actually do care about it.

104
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,590
Anyway guys go out and try this one for yourself.

105
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:48,350
See the next letter.
