Hey guys, welcome back to the "el classo."
1

2
00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:07.140
This lecture, we're going to get
a little more in-depth with Twitter.
2

3
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.500
We went over it a little bit in the last lectures,
but we've just kind of blazed through it.
3

4
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.430
So in the past we covered how there are a lot of ways of finding
people who are complaining about the problem you solve,
4

5
00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:18.510
So in the past we covered how there are a lot of ways of finding
people who are complaining about the problem you solve,
5

6
00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.810
and Twitter was just merely one of those
ways of finding complainy people.
6

7
00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.510
But outside of people just complaining about their
lives, which might just sum up human existence,
7

8
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.950
Twitter is still a goldmine for a lot of things business.
8

9
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:36.150
You see, Twitter is just a beehive of people that
are talking about pretty much anything.
9

10
00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.130
Unlike Facebook, you can see and join the
conversations of literally anyone on it.
10

11
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:46.750
There are pretty much no restrictions in that regard,
unless you're stalking someone and they block you.
11

12
00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:52.030
And oh, as I like to point out, there are roughly
300 million people that use it monthly.
12

13
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.620
There are some people who practically live on this
service, like our president. Because it's an open field
13

14
00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.210
of people talking and displaying their interest,
14

15
00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.960
that's why we use it, and that's why we use it
early on in our business development efforts.
15

16
00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.900
We are still focusing on getting those first 10 precious
customers, and we don't want to have to, say,
16

17
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.400
build out a six month content marketing strategy
just to get to the point of 10 customers.
17

18
00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.380
For those of you that are not familiar, Twitter is just
a social network where you communicate through
18

19
00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:29.210
140 character tweets, which are really just
messages that get posted onto a timeline.
19

20
00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.420
It is very similar to, say, like a Facebook news feed,
20

21
00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.930
and then anyone who is following you can read those.
21

22
00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:39.140
If you're active on it and you help
people out, you'll get a following.
22

23
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.030
Pretty simple.
23

24
00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.980
The bigger following you have, the
more people will see what you say.
24

25
00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.080
OK, so let's get set up in Twitter real fast, so
25

26
00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.170
you can follow along with the next
strategies. Later on in the course,
26

27
00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.990
we're going to cover how to optimize your
profile and then create inbound traffic to it,
27

28
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.620
but right now we just want to get set up
so we can start sending messages.
28

29
00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.040
If you have a Twitter, well, then you can
officially skip this part of the lecture.
29

30
00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.500
Just press the skip button, see you next lecture.
30

31
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.470
All right, so go to Twitter.com, click
"Sign up" on the top right. Now,
31

32
00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:15.660
don't be distracted by the news updates about whatever
the Kardashians do. I'll satisfy your curiosity and tell you.
32

33
00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:16.250
don't be distracted by the news updates about whatever
the Kardashians do. I'll satisfy your curiosity and tell you.
33

34
00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.720
Well, they do nothing on camera for a living.
34

35
00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:21.660
After you hit "Sign up,"
35

36
00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.780
fill out your details and just move on.
36

37
00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.250
Yes, let Twitter tailor their experience for you.
37

38
00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:28.560
None of that really matters.
38

39
00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.510
You do not actually have to add your phone,
39

40
00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.050
so just skip it to save time, you can go back and do it later.
40

41
00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.590
Pick a username preferably related
to your business in some way.
41

42
00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:43.470
Now, you can either create this account for yourself
or for your business. An account that's made for
42

43
00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.310
yourself might come off as more
personal when you send messages,
43

44
00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.410
yourself might come off as more
personal when you send messages,
44

45
00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.480
but you'll have to make sure you sound
more personal when you communicate.
45

46
00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.160
There's nothing necessarily wrong with that,
46

47
00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.180
just be aware that if it's coming from a person,
it should sound like it's coming from a person.
47

48
00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.940
Pick whatever username you can get that hasn't yet been
taken by the username squatters and proceed to your page.
48

49
00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.200
Pick whatever username you can get that hasn't yet been
taken by the username squatters and proceed to your page.
49

50
00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.000
Click through and then you can select some interests.
50

51
00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.970
Click through and then you can select some interests.
51

52
00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:08.730
Now, it doesn't really matter what you pick.
52

53
00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.720
You can always go back and change this.
53

54
00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.910
This is just designed to populate your
page on the first time you log in.
54

55
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.090
Then you can decide to follow the
suggested users they give you.
55

56
00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.280
That, again, doesn't really matter.
56

57
00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:21.090
Go for it.
57

58
00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.160
If you say yes, then the most recent tweets from
those accounts will show up in your News Feed.
58

59
00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.300
Of course, if you say no, well, then your
news feed is going to be very, very lonely.
59

60
00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.990
Hurray, we are through and now we
have ourselves a brand new Twitter.
60

61
00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.650
First thing we want to do is click on the left hand
side of the picture where you see a picture of an
61

62
00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:41.760
egg and replace that with an actual
human or business logo photo.
62

63
00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.380
Find the highest resolution image you have of yourself.
63

64
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.340
I mean yourself, not of a cat or a dog.
64

65
00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.410
I usually am fine with you doing that, but not today.
65

66
00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:52.290
Whatever you upload,
66

67
00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:59.000
if it's low resolution, then on Twitter it's going to
look especially bad and blown out of proportion.
67

68
00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.200
Once you have that image up, click on
your name and then click "Edit profile."
68

69
00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:07.750
Now, here we just want to make sure
we have some information about us.
69

70
00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:13.910
If it's for you as a person, write what the meaning
of life is and make sure not to get it wrong. After
70

71
00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:19.120
that, just add a sentence about what you're working
on, with a link to your business, product, or project.
71

72
00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.830
That's really it.
72

73
00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:22.590
We just don't want this to be blank. Okay. Hurray again,
73

74
00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:28.020
now you are on Twitter and you can participate in the next lectures
of manually mining some good old fashioned customers.
74

75
00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:29.180
now you are on Twitter and you can participate in the next lectures
of manually mining some good old fashioned customers.
75

76
00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:35.080
You can, if you want, to add a cover photo by
clicking at the top of the profile in that rectangle,
76

77
00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:40.530
but again, that's really up to you. If you've ever
used a service called Canva.com, which we'll
77

78
00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.650
use throughout this course,
78

79
00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:46.920
you can actually use them to borrow
a template for that cover photo. Really,
79

80
00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.180
it'll take you five minutes.
80

81
00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:49.620
Either way, not a big deal.
81

82
00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.500
I will see you guys in the next lecture.
