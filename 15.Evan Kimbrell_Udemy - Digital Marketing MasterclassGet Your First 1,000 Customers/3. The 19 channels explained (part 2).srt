00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,930
Oh, and would you look at that, you stayed with me.
1

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:05,390
Let's get back on track with number six, email marketing.
2

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,590
Let's get back on track with number six, email marketing.
3

4
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:14,190
I am sure you have subscribed to a couple newsletters,
Groupons, Udemies, or your favorite restaurants.
4

5
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:18,990
When you get ads routinely advertising discounts
or giving you news about the business,
5

6
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:24,870
that is what email marketing is. The gist here is
that you build up a subscription base of emails by
6

7
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:27,610
actively trying to get users to sign up.
7

8
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:34,260
Then you send emails regularly trying to sell your
products or services or just trying to endear yourself
8

9
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,380
to the person receiving the email.
9

10
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:41,520
True story, go to Udemy.com, create
a second account, wait 48 hours,
10

11
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,400
they will send you an email with a $10 coupon.
11

12
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:46,410
Don't tell them I was the one who told you.
12

13
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:53,220
Now, multi-billion dollar businesses have been built
off email marketing, so don't ignore this channel,
13

14
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:56,500
especially if you want to emulate Groupon,
14

15
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,690
that flaming ball of trash hurling itself
currently towards the earth.
15

16
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:05,970
Number seven, existing platforms. Now, depending on
what you're selling, there may or may not be established
16

17
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:10,380
platforms or businesses that you can
piggyback off of to sell your product.
17

18
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:14,760
No, I'm not talking about Twitter, which
actually falls into a different channel.
18

19
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:21,960
I'm talking about if you, say, sell $6,000 wooden desks,
mostly to people in Brooklyn, you have Etsy.
19

20
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:27,550
If you sell antiques, electronics, or something
you just stole, you have Ebay or possibly Amazon.
20

21
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,100
If you sell digital courses, you have something like Udemy.
21

22
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:37,140
If you're renting out a vacation home or a spare
space that you have, you have Airbnb. If you sell
22

23
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,550
graphic design, there are a whole bunch of places.
23

24
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:45,660
Now, it's not just platforms that can sell your stuff,
you can use the platforms for your promotional efforts.
24

25
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:46,200
Now, it's not just platforms that can sell your stuff,
you can use the platforms for your promotional efforts.
25

26
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:50,910
Facebook, for instance, can be used to promote your
app or game, Spotify, you can create a playlist that
26

27
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:56,610
links back to your website, SlideShare lets you put
presentations up online and then link back to your
27

28
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:02,340
site, etc. Can you leverage the promotional and community
aspects of a different system to bring in traffic for your site?
28

29
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,710
site, etc. Can you leverage the promotional and community
aspects of a different system to bring in traffic for your site?
29

30
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:09,120
Well, this strategy, which is often compared to being
a tick on a dog's collar (I think Gandhi said that),
30

31
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:12,780
there are still large businesses
that have been built this way.
31

32
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:13,650
Don't ignore it.
32

33
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:19,110
Number eight, affiliate programs. Affiliate programs
are sets of incentives that you make, publish, and
33

34
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:24,260
then manage to entice affiliates into
promoting your product on their own.
34

35
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:27,390
Affiliates are people that are
authorized to sell your product.
35

36
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:32,360
In this case, you might not have complete
control over how they promote it.
36

37
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,240
You end up giving the affiliate a cut of your sales profit,
37

38
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:40,950
often a high amount, and that further incentivizes
them to continue marketing your product.
38

39
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:46,890
That is, of course, until they find a better deal to sell
and they jump ship - usually to porn. Number nine,
39

40
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:52,740
business development. Business development, often
called B-Dev by the bros, is the process of establishing
40

41
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:58,230
partnerships and agreements with other companies
or startups to either promote each other's products
41

42
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:02,840
or services or to simply use the product.
42

43
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:08,730
You find a partner company, website, community, or blog,
and you establish a promotional partnership of some sort.
43

44
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:09,330
You find a partner company, website, community, or blog,
and you establish a promotional partnership of some sort.
44

45
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:15,790
Maybe you agree to promote each other's products,
commonly referred to as a joint venture (JV).
45

46
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:21,180
Maybe you share ad space, since your groups are
complementary, or, in the extreme, maybe you combine your
46

47
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:28,210
products or offer a large discount to your partners
group, or you just sell them a big old contract to
47

48
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:30,690
your stuff. Number ten and the last one
we're going to cover, targeting blogs.
48

49
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:31,830
your stuff. Number ten and the last one
we're going to cover, targeting blogs.
49

50
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:37,280
This could honestly be called PR, but in this
day and age, it actually needs its own channel.
50

51
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,850
This is when you go out and target
individual blogs in your niche.
51

52
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:46,650
You could get them to straight promote you with
an affiliate setup, but more likely, you'll ask them to
52

53
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:49,040
let you guest blog or something similar.
53

54
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,080
What is guest blogging? You might ask.
54

55
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:55,970
It's when you ask the blog if you can write some content
for them and either have a blurb about yourself
55

56
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:59,950
at the bottom or get to mention your
product, and then they post it on their blog,
56

57
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,560
the benefit being that they get content
from an expert and you get exposure.
57

58
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:08,130
Ok, wow, that was the whirlwind tour of the
10 channels we will cover in this course.
58

59
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:13,230
If you want to read about the other nine, I suggest you
read the attached resources, where we describe them.
59

60
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:13,960
If you want to read about the other nine, I suggest you
read the attached resources, where we describe them.
60

61
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:18,660
This will help you out in the next section, where we
talk about building your strategy and which of the
61

62
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,780
19 fits you and your product specifically.
62

63
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:23,190
All right, I'll see you in the next lecture.
