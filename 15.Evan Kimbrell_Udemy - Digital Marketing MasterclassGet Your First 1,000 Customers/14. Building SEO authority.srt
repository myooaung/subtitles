1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,190
All right guys we are back.

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:03,740
Here we go once again.

3
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:08,460
We've been discussing all these different ways to improve SEO over the section of the course and in

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:13,020
our last lecture we talked about link building and this lecture on expand upon why link building is

5
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:15,770
so important in terms of a concept called authority.

6
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:18,870
So what do we know about the SBO value of a page.

7
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:24,780
Well pages rank highly not only because they are awesome well put together pages but because many other

8
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:30,180
people agree they are awesome by visiting the page sharing the page and then linking to said Page.

9
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:31,170
And this is a big difference.

10
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:35,700
I want to highlight for all the work you do when pages get lots of attention and links from outside

11
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:36,520
sources.

12
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:40,280
It's hard to prove in the eyes of Google that the page really does have value.

13
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:43,920
And over time the page can build authority or real importance and influence.

14
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:49,800
Now this idea in mind Maw's reference and before Monster.com created a way to try and measure the authority

15
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,060
of a page and its Web site.

16
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:56,160
Now Mazas an NCO consulting group that's been around for over a decade and has established itself as

17
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:02,070
an influential source on that FCO knowledge and what maws did was create their own algorithm to measure

18
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:03,930
something called Page authority.

19
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:09,540
Now Page 30 is a measure on a scale of 1 to a hundred other pages ability to rank on a search engine

20
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:10,520
the result page.

21
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,920
The higher the score the better Maw's believes the pages chance are for being ranked highly on the SC

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,150
RPM search engine ranking pages.

23
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:22,790
In addition they also develop domain authority which as you might guess is the same measurement and

24
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,210
instead of a page it's for the Web site as a whole.

25
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:31,370
So with measurements like page authority and domain authority or P-A NDA if you're cool like breathe

26
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:36,930
everything you might have a few questions What's a good score you might ask what's the score I might

27
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,090
want to try and get.

28
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:41,760
How do I improve my score but also how relevant is the score.

29
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:45,360
Now first of all the reasons you don't want to pay attention to scores like page authorities to know

30
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,460
if your efforts are working from a non-Google standpoint as important as Google is it helps to get a

31
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,380
different perspective.

32
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:55,380
And this rating is another strong indicator of how good your SCA work has been.

33
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:58,070
So how do you get a good page authority score well.

34
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:02,610
Mazas worked on an algorithm that takes many things into account and includes many of the same basic

35
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:05,160
FCL lessons that we've already covered.

36
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,400
Make sure your page uses good code.

37
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:11,350
Make sure it has the links going from and leading to the page.

38
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,680
Make sure the content is complete and well written.

39
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,880
Always there is more to it but you should see that if you're doing what you're supposed to you know

40
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:23,430
following all the SEO best practices that you've already discussed while your page should have a high

41
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:24,450
authority score.

42
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:29,250
Now keep in mind though that the number of links leading to a page from outside sources definitely will

43
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,260
affect its score.

44
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:36,050
So don't expect a good P.A. page authority score as soon as you publish it.

45
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:40,050
In fact most pages start with a one until they actually start getting an downlinks.

46
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:44,730
If you're curious about these scores and you can install Mazas browser tool called the Maw's bar now

47
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,500
once you activate it it looks something like this.

48
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,820
When you visit different sites you to guess for example at a site like I don't know ESPN.

49
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,620
What kind of page authority would its home page have or domain authority.

50
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,210
Do you get something high.

51
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:57,130
Well you'd be right.

52
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:03,870
Because as you can see the ESPN home page has a page authority of ninety 95 Jesus and a domain authority

53
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:06,490
of 96 or even higher.

54
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,590
So if you're to somehow get a link from ESPN home page.

55
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,900
Well give a significant boost here as you know.

56
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:18,440
If someone important links to you they just assume you also are important like SBO And also mean girls.

57
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:20,630
But what does this mean for search results.

58
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,680
How does page authority and domain authority really affect search results and you've got the laws bar

59
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,210
installed.

60
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,560
Well look for yourself.

61
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:31,500
Check out a Google search like how to install a TV soundbar.

62
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:36,110
I don't know how it's a thing you can now see the page authority and domain it listed below.

63
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:40,980
Each result in a quick scan shows you that the top results generally come from sites with higher domain

64
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:44,950
authority but the pages themselves don't necessarily have high authority at all.

65
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:47,850
So does this mean page authority is meaningless.

66
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:52,950
No what it tells me is this pages with high page authority like ESPN.

67
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:59,280
Home Page could easily rank high for very competitive words words like sports news however pages with

68
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:05,160
low pages already don't really have a chance for the same terms but they do have a chance of ranking

69
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:10,380
for very specific longtail keyword phrases like How to install a TV soundbar.

70
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:11,310
None of this makes sense.

71
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:14,840
Authority is just another way to measure how you're doing with your efforts.

72
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:20,130
But again just a number of actual goals are trying to accomplish like reaching a thousand paying customers.

73
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:20,720
Cough cough.

74
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,540
The point of the course.

75
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,580
That's the kind of number you want to monitor.

76
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:28,410
Once you've implemented these SEO tactics now in fact we'll get into some of the numbers and metrics

77
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:33,740
you should look at in our next lecture to help you determine if your efforts are actually working.

78
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,440
All right guys I'll see you then.
