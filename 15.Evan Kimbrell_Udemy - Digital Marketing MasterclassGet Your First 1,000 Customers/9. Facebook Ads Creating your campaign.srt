1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,260
All right guys welcome back to the course.

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:05,800
Our last lecture me got all set up in Facebook's ad manager.

3
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:09,590
So now we can get to the fun part of actually creating a campaign.

4
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:11,950
That's what I'm going to walk through in this lecture.

5
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:18,390
So we want to head back to the ads manager go to business dot Facebook dot com then click on the hamburger

6
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:19,510
menu in the upper left.

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,100
Yeah it's actually called a hamburger menu.

8
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:25,410
Now mouse over all tools and under the Create plus manage section.

9
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:27,680
You should see Button says ads manager.

10
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:33,150
Now if you haven't created an ad or a campaign before Facebook might drop you right into the new campaign

11
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:38,590
creation page you'll know that because it's a campaign choose your objective.

12
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:43,950
If you're following along and you're not on this page then you're probably on the ads manager dashboard

13
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:49,690
where you can see four times shown horizontally account overview campaigns ad sets and ads.

14
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:50,730
That's perfectly fine.

15
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:56,610
Facebook likes to cut to the chase sometimes and gets you into that ad creation screen sooner so that's

16
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:01,240
fine let's just go up to the green button in the upper right that says Create and and then click that.

17
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:06,180
Now everyone should be on the same page and you can actually see the steps for setting up a campaign

18
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,100
on the left.

19
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:13,050
Now you'll see this structured campaign ad account ad set and an ad campaign is where we're going to

20
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:16,120
tell Facebook what our goal is for the campaign.

21
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:19,380
But choosing a specific goal Facebook will give us customized options.

22
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:23,300
For example if you want to drive traffic to our website the last time you are out.

23
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:27,630
But if we want to generate more likes of our Facebook page for instance then they'll give us different

24
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:32,550
fields to fill that out out a cow is our business the info where we tell Facebook which account this

25
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:35,890
is for now you shouldn't actually have to touch any of that.

26
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:38,400
And that is where we define our audience for this.

27
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,530
And by selecting all kinds of different attributes based on all that juicy Facebook data we also choose

28
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:48,600
some of the settings for the campaign including how much will spend and how long we want to run it for

29
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:52,230
now it is where we create our ads and figure out where they're going to go.

30
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:54,090
But each of these steps has different choices.

31
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:58,830
Kind of like a Choose Your Own Adventure book that all hinges on which campaign objective you choose.

32
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,350
So let's start there.

33
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,390
Now you'll see a group of 10 or so objectives to choose from.

34
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:07,600
They're listed under three different types awareness consideration and conversion.

35
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:12,780
These might sound familiar because they're the three stages of what's called the customer journey awareness

36
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:16,030
objectives are focused on introducing yourself to a new audience.

37
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,850
Getting on the map so to speak.

38
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:22,590
Consideration objectives can help customers learn more as they're weighing options for a purchase for

39
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:22,980
instance.

40
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:28,080
And then lastly conversion objectives match up with the with customer decisions like when sales are

41
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:28,590
made.

42
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:33,500
If you click on each of the 10 objectives you'll see the information on the left and below the changes.

43
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:38,340
You choose brand awareness while you simply give your campaign a name and then you just begin.

44
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:41,640
You choose traffic then you'll have the option of doing a split test.

45
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:45,660
And if you choose engagement Well you actually choose another option of what kind of content you want

46
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:46,720
to get engagement for.

47
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,980
So could be post pages or events.

48
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:52,700
For example I want to create here my goal is to drive traffic to my website.

49
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,890
I've got a service on trying to form and I want people to learn about it.

50
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:58,590
I'll create a landing page and drive people to that specifically.

51
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:01,600
So if that's my goal I'm going to pick traffic.

52
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,830
But since we're doing this for the first time let's just add another wrinkle to it.

53
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:07,380
Let's just do a split test.

54
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:13,110
This way we can test out our first efforts here with two versions of the same at so check off the split

55
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:15,750
test box and go down and then name this thing.

56
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:21,570
Call it whatever you want and click the set up an count below that we probably want to do a split test

57
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:26,700
upfront because chances are this is the first ad you've written for Facebook for your product and chances

58
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,610
are you're not going to get the best ad on the first attempt.

59
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:34,530
Usually you come up with two ideas and it really can make a big difference when you're testing and you

60
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,160
least do one other version.

61
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:39,840
Now this you really just need to confirm the settings you see are correct.

62
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:42,400
Got the account country currency time zone.

63
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,890
That's obviously all be correct.

64
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:44,970
You shouldn't have to touch anything.

65
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:49,740
And also just continue what comes next is the asset which I'll leave for the next lecture because it

66
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,230
includes setting up your audience.

67
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,150
Now that will be a cool part I promise.

68
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,720
But it might take a little bit of time.

69
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:59,640
So let's break and we'll just come back together in the next lecture.

70
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,150
See you later.
