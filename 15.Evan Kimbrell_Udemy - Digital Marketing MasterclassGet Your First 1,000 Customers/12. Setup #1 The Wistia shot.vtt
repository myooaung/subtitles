00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:01.380
Hey guys welcome back.

2
00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:07.300
All right so in our most recent lectures we went over the fundamentals of lighting audio and video and

3
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:13.470
the last one we started talking about budgets and then we kind of went through which budget you have

4
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:16.800
and therefore what's the best setup you can get for making videos.

5
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.780
Now I'll just repeat this one idea because it can help to hear it again.

6
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:26.090
You can produce great videos on any budget but if you can invest in better equipment it generally is

7
00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:27.510
just going to make it easier.

8
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.220
Now the other factor that can help you achieve some success there are videos is the setup you choose

9
00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:33.000
for your production.

10
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.970
Now this means how will you set up your camera.

11
00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.130
Hand your lights and your mikes and especially the people that are supposed to be on camera.

12
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.100
Where will you shoot and what will the shoot look like.

13
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.020
What will the scene look.

14
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.670
Well the frame looks like they're figuring out your setup first.

15
00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.390
It will make it a lot easier and probably less expensive to buy the equipment you need.

16
00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.430
Otherwise you're kind of guessing and you might end up with stuff you don't need.

17
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:55.970
It's kind of like furnishing an apartment.

18
00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.150
You know you're on a space you've got like the dimensions and the shape of it.

19
00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.670
Then it's easier to figure out what pieces of furniture to buy.

20
00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.600
If you first think about how you'll use the space well I found that a great way to figure out your own

21
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.840
video setups is just just get inspiration from others.

22
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:15.000
So in the next set of lectures WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO IS WE'RE GONNA GO OVER THREE different video production

23
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.250
setups that are really common really versatile and really easy to do.

24
00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.500
Now you don't have to be a cinematographer or even someone who is remotely creative.

25
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.600
I am not creative to look at these shots we're going gonna cover and say I like that.

26
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.570
That's good for this and this and this and I can emulate that and in fact these shots have been emulated

27
00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.070
all over the place.

28
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.360
Once you see them it's kind of hard to unsee it because then all of sudden certain interesting a lot

29
00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.740
of people use that style.

30
00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.840
No reason to reinvent the wheel.

31
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.190
You might as well just borrow what other people have done.

32
00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.580
And well it's effective.

33
00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.920
Again we're focusing on the message of our marketing not necessarily by focusing all our creative energy

34
00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.800
on making the coolest shot we can.

35
00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.100
Now the first that I'm going to talk about is what I called the Whisky a shot we've engine whiskey a

36
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.270
few times before in this video marketing section but I'm gonna remind you again who they are.

37
00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.880
They're a video hosting company that provides a platform with a lot of analytics but video usage and

38
00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:12.750
effectiveness.

39
00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.140
I used to use Vista and I did generally like using them.

40
00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.730
However I found that they're very expensive and I've since changed to sprout video.

41
00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.500
Now if you're serious about producing videos that generate a lot of feedback and conversions and are

42
00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.630
you know pretty hip and cool.

43
00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.040
Check out whiskey.

44
00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.400
OK.

45
00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.290
So they have a really big learning library if you just go to their home page and click learn they've

46
00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:41.740
made a lot of videos just going over basic things for your marketing videos how to look good on a Web

47
00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:48.660
cam how to film screens how to film in different settings how to recreate certain looks they even did

48
00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:54.060
a thing on ring lights and that's partially where I got the opinion about ring lines but I have also

49
00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.320
use them and just generally don't like them but they use them so naturally if they're providing all

50
00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.070
this video expertise or they ought to be able to produce their own videos.

51
00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.450
Right.

52
00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:02.750
Well they do.

53
00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.210
And you can go check them out there.

54
00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:05.900
They're fun they're interesting.

55
00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.000
They use a lot of pretty easy techniques.

56
00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.290
And if you can copy them and all you guys have watched a lot of my courses you notice that I have actually

57
00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.420
copied several of their editing techniques.

58
00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.210
Now here's what I'm talking about the whiskey you shot.

59
00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.800
They have this repeated shot over and over and over again.

60
00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.330
It's so popular that a lot of people have copied them.

61
00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:28.800
In fact they have a video course on udemy super old.

62
00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.240
You have to search for it and dig for it and it's free.

63
00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.120
But one of the things that cover is how to set this up.

64
00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.580
You can also find it on their Web site.

65
00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.840
So I call this the Whisky a shot and the video looks a lot like this.

66
00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.710
Now this is a reference image they shared on their site to show people what their videos look like.

67
00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:49.050
Well you can essentially see that there's one speaker in the video and he's located right smack dab

68
00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:51.880
center of the frame or you know the visible area.

69
00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.810
This is repeated over and over and over again.

70
00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:00.540
It's always one person right in the center with the camera slightly higher than their eye level.

71
00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.260
It's hard to notice this but if you watch their videos they'll explain it.

72
00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.140
You can see it's directly above their eyes.

73
00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:12.030
They also put their lights really high up like stadium lights so the lights are actually coming down

74
00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.980
on you.

75
00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:14.790
Now why do people put their lights really high up.

76
00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:20.640
Well in general the higher the lights if you have a higher angle it'll hit you in a more gratifying

77
00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:26.280
way kind of like how will light models sometimes like putting lights up like this.

78
00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:32.250
And it'll hit them creating obviously the false effect of having abs but in general just a more flat

79
00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:33.780
flattering way of doing it.

80
00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:40.570
Now the standard way they do it is one person standing in front of a solid color seamless background.

81
00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:44.790
Now they use a different bunch of different colors and they use these tools that hold all the schools

82
00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:47.660
of seamless paper and you pull a string it pulls it down.

83
00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.140
But that's what they did.

84
00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:53.790
And then what they do is they take the light and they point it backwards at the paper.

85
00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:59.580
And what that does is it creates a very nice gradient effect and you don't see the part where the light

86
00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:03.010
slams into the paper because usually it's behind the person.

87
00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:07.550
Now without the background you'll notice that sometimes they will do the exact same thing that same

88
00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:08.110
setup.

89
00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:11.710
However they'll be in the office right and they use the office as the background.

90
00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:16.910
If use the proper lighting and camera setup while these two shots while they look basically identical

91
00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:21.800
probably because they use the same stuff and this setup has inspired a lot of marketers create videos

92
00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.340
that look the exact same way.

93
00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:26.930
It's really a great shot for explaining things.

94
00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:32.990
It just shows one face not a lot going on in the background and you know that the slightly elevated

95
00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:36.260
look makes it easier to kind of connect like you're talking to the person.

96
00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.030
It's like a really good spotlight video.

97
00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:44.180
So it's great for them explaining things talking through things telling stories and then you use editing

98
00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:49.240
to kind of make up for how simple and really kind of bland.

99
00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:55.070
The shot itself is now no wisdom it was not the first to shoot a video like this but they got pretty

100
00:05:55.070 --> 00:06:00.320
popular and their influence in recent years is real because while they share a lot of advice so people

101
00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:04.420
can produce great videos remember it's in their best interest because they host videos they want their

102
00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:06.130
own to succeed in their video production.

103
00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:06.290
All right.

104
00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:08.490
So let's explain the whiskey shot set.

105
00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:12.710
We'll try to break down a little bit more and look at the details with a shot like this your speaker

106
00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:13.760
is basically lit.

107
00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:15.040
So let's talk about lighting.

108
00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:19.740
Well we're still used as a setup with two lights on either side of the camera illuminating the speaker.

109
00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:25.160
They use flat lighting if you guys remember this flat lighting is my favorite although they don't ever

110
00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.650
actually mentioned this but you can tell when they zoom out.

111
00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:31.840
Like I said before they put their lights up well above the speaker and then pointing them down.

112
00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:36.350
I mean only well above their least like a couple feet above putting down and then they use a third light

113
00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:41.840
not as a hair light or something to illuminate the speaker but instead against the background and it

114
00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:45.720
creates kind of like a halo effect and that's I don't know a pretty good look.

115
00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:49.220
Now for their lighting they use nice stuff.

116
00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:56.570
I'm pretty sure what they use are called Kino flow diva lights and a diva light is pretty expensive

117
00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:02.120
and it's kind of like a midsize compact light but it is very much a professional light and they always

118
00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:05.910
kind of act like oh it's so easy to do this but then they use these two thousand lights.

119
00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:12.020
You can do the same thing easily with any of the LCD recovered and the mid-level package in the budget

120
00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:19.610
lecture you can also do it with a cheap hundred dollars soft boxes you know the quality might not be

121
00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:26.690
the exact same but you're gonna get the same exact shot now for the background they use savage seamless

122
00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:32.270
paper The is called Savage again Each roll of paper we kind of talked to us before they're about 60

123
00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:36.920
bucks so you pick a color and then there are these attachments you can stall into a wall where you can

124
00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:39.520
use multiple colors if you want to mix it up quickly.

125
00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:44.170
Now if you do want to buy the attachment you can just roll out the paper cut it and then tape it.

126
00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:47.820
I didn't actually do that for one of my courses stated at the top right.

127
00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:53.270
Cut off more than you need above the frame and then just tape it there or you can use kind of like a

128
00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:54.780
clothesline.

129
00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:57.320
There's a lot of different ways you can do it you're just hanging a roll.

130
00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:01.310
One thing to keep in mind is that is just be careful not to crinkle the paper when you do this because

131
00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:05.780
that'll actually screw up the gradient effect of the light that hits the background and it's something

132
00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:11.900
that God it's actually really innocuously noticeable because the whole background says to be the smooth

133
00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:16.140
outwardly flowing kind of gradient and a bit of a crinkle it just screws it up.

134
00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:21.680
Now besides that seamless paper you know we showed that they also will do their offices right.

135
00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:26.090
And for the office you'll notice this that they always shoot during the day and you also know that there's

136
00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:29.980
a lot of windows and that when those windows will naturally illuminate things.

137
00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:34.080
So at that point you don't need any background lighting you're just lighting the person and that's it.

138
00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:35.570
If you have a location you want to try.

139
00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:38.560
You can obviously see what it looks like coming in.

140
00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:40.730
If you have an office where you can do this that's it.

141
00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:42.680
You can this a great idea.

142
00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:45.290
Sometimes you can do these a coworking spaces if you want.

143
00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:48.000
Generally these are it's a little bit harder to pull this off though.

144
00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:53.310
Now for the audio in this shot WTA uses a shotgun mike that's attached to a stand.

145
00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:57.610
Now the stand is as close to the speaker as possible of course it's out of the frame so it's not visible.

146
00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:02.910
The stand is extended high and the mike at the end of it points down towards the speaker's face.

147
00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:09.830
They prefer to have the shotgun point downward where your voice is going to be projecting towards.

148
00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:13.580
And that's something I have seen but I honestly haven't noticed the difference between pointing it directly

149
00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:15.480
at the person or directly down.

150
00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:19.880
I think the point is it kind of intercepts the sound as it goes past you but whatever.

151
00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:27.990
Now the camera that they use I believe is the cannon see one hundred or the cannon five D.

152
00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:32.000
And now you might have remembered remember the five days when you talked about the really expensive

153
00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.280
package you could do.

154
00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:39.380
Those are usually pretty expensive cameras because they're pro Sumer and you can use them for real professional

155
00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:42.050
setups but you can do with whatever camera you have.

156
00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:44.420
I mean I've done it with a point and shoot I've done it with a DSL.

157
00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:47.450
Are you can you do it with a smartphone if you want to.

158
00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:51.110
Again smartphones are kind of rough because you can't control the zoom level.

159
00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:56.360
I prefer to use something or at least you can zoom and it's it's not digital zoom it's optical zoom.

160
00:09:56.390 --> 00:10:01.460
But anyway it's relatively easy to set up now alternative things you can on top of it as well you can

161
00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:03.880
add on a teleprompter if you need to.

162
00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:10.190
You can add on a ring light and in fact they usually will use a ring like in the shot and it basically

163
00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:16.580
does it covers your face and it kind of lifts of the shadows there and also gives this ring effect on

164
00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:18.080
your eyes which is fine.

165
00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:24.190
However you're only wears glasses then don't go for the ring like it'll just reflect on your glass.

166
00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:28.030
So anyway this is an easy setup to do and it's ideal for explainer videos.

167
00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:31.760
Even Q and A videos you answer questions your customers might have.

168
00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:33.200
How are you set up the shot.

169
00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:38.900
You'll get pretty good at it because it's so basic so you can very easily take it up take it down.

170
00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:39.980
Swap out speakers.

171
00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:41.150
It shouldn't really be an issue.

172
00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:42.810
Now if you want to do with the issue on action.

173
00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:46.310
Well check out the video but about directing non actors on camera.

174
00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:51.260
Well it begins with a classic with a shot but then they cut to show the director behind the scenes.

175
00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:56.600
Well here you can actually see the setup we've been talking about in this lecture and there on screen

176
00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:58.190
while the director of the video talks.

177
00:10:58.190 --> 00:11:02.930
So if you have your own one person videos to produce then I suggest getting a setup a try.

178
00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:04.580
But let me emphasize this point again.

179
00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:09.440
The setup is ideal for videos or you only have one person speaking and you don't plan on offering any

180
00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:10.430
other camera angles.

181
00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:14.210
It's also not good if you're trying to move if you're thinking about adding additional cameras to get

182
00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:19.700
close up like a close up shot on a side shot well then it's just not going to work because the gradient

183
00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:21.530
effect of the light will change.

184
00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:26.090
And also if you change the angle and you probably see the end of the seamless paper that it doesn't

185
00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:26.660
look good.

186
00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:27.120
So that's it.

187
00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:28.220
That's the worst shot.

188
00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:35.180
It's one person talking head it generally cuts off around like your nipples depending on how tall you

189
00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:35.580
are.

190
00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:41.090
Oftentimes enough to shorten it depending on the height of the person you use flat lighting you put

191
00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:46.040
the lights quite a bit higher than the person's eyes you put the camera slightly higher in the person's

192
00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:46.670
eyes.

193
00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:51.130
Use a ring like if you can and you just use basic seamless paper.

194
00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:56.270
Pick a nice background color that you can use and swap out routinely and there you go.

195
00:11:56.270 --> 00:11:58.130
I like this shot because it's just really versatile.

196
00:11:58.130 --> 00:12:00.300
It's great for telling stories.

197
00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:05.120
It's great for Q and A's it's great for anything that's upfront and personal that doesn't need some

198
00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:06.720
kind of flavoring onto it.

199
00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:12.050
What you do with this then is you use a lot of editing and a lot of other techniques we'll talk about

200
00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:17.410
later in this section to really spice it up because you can't just have this forever guys the next set

201
00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:20.310
up we're gonna talk about is the common interview setup.

202
00:12:20.570 --> 00:12:21.200
All right see you then.
