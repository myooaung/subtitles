00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,390
All right guys, here we are, welcome back.
1

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:07,320
So we spent a good amount of time in the last lecture 
getting comfy with Snapchat, thinking up ideas
2

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:09,570
for content to snap and share,
3

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:14,640
and we started into a couple of tactics to 
help promote things, like a branded geofilter,
4

5
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:20,040
remember, it's only like $5 for 20,000 square feet,
or cross-promoting on other social channels as well.
5

6
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:20,720
remember, it's only like $5 for 20,000 square feet,
or cross-promoting on other social channels as well.
6

7
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:25,170
Well, in this lecture, I want to explain one particular
tactic that a bunch of brands have used as a way
7

8
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:26,740
to expand their own following,
8

9
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:32,370
essentially piggybacking on the goodwill of another 
account, and this is what's called a takeover. In general
9

10
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:38,430
social media terms, a takeover is when someone takes 
over a social media account, be it a Twitter, Facebook,
10

11
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,560
or, yes, a Snapchat account.
11

12
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:43,500
It generally lasts for like a few hours, sometimes a whole day.
12

13
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,940
The idea here is that the person shows 
you a different side of your brand,
13

14
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:48,670
it's from their perspective.
14

15
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:54,540
It's often much less marketing and prepared content
and more spontaneous, fun, and unpredictable. So that
15

16
00:00:54,540 --> 00:01:00,300
special someone could be, let's say, an employee, like 
Jimmy from the mail room, or, I don't know, the CEO.
16

17
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:04,200
And if you wanted to show off your business from 
a different point of view, it's not a bad idea.
17

18
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,970
But our goal right now is to build a 
following and grow your customer base.
18

19
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:13,830
With that in mind, it would make more sense to choose 
someone with a bigger following and some influence in
19

20
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:17,250
the hopes that it will benefit your Snapchat 
following and your brand as a whole.
20

21
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:20,660
Now, here is roughly how this works. When Brand A,
21

22
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:27,300
that's you, asks brand B, somebody with a big old 
following that's directly related to what you do or
22

23
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:33,180
your audience, when you ask them to take over their 
account, brand A is obviously hoping that brand B's
23

24
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,800
followers, well, first, you know, obviously care about what you're 
posting, and then perhaps they'll click through and follow
24

25
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:40,350
followers, well, first, you know, obviously care about what you're 
posting, and then perhaps they'll click through and follow
25

26
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:45,450
your account. And then obviously, somewhere down 
the line, that person who then follows your Snapchat
26

27
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:50,550
account stays in touch with your company and eventually 
buys from you. Brand A wants to use Brand B's
27

28
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:55,220
influence to raise its own profile. Depending 
on who you ask to take over your profile,
28

29
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:58,290
it might also make you look cooler or more legitimate.
29

30
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:03,890
It can certainly show off your brand in a new light,
since it'll be happening from a different perspective
30

31
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:05,850
that is not your own for a change.
31

32
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:10,830
So who is this magic person that can bring all these 
new followers and attention to your Snapchat account?
32

33
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,140
Now, obviously, it could be a celebrity, you know.
33

34
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:17,470
Sure, if you actually know a celebrity, 
then you could try to do this.
34

35
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,920
But the odds of that happening are basically none.
35

36
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:26,520
But maybe it could be a more local
influencer or a local personality.
36

37
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:30,360
Obviously, the higher the profile, the better it is if you're 
trying to establish brand recognition and reputation.
37

38
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,130
Obviously, the higher the profile, the better it is if you're 
trying to establish brand recognition and reputation.
38

39
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:36,810
But at the very beginning it's going to be harder 
to reach these upper groups of people.
39

40
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:42,240
Now, what I generally suggest is you go for influencers, 
and this is really just someone with a big-ish
40

41
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:47,910
following on Snapchat or at least other channels. 
Handing the reins over to them means they'll promote
41

42
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:54,160
the takeover to their followers, potentially exposing
you obviously to tons of their new eyeballs.
42

43
00:02:54,240 --> 00:03:00,300
So who is shaping the conversation in your market or at least 
in a related market and has some headway in Snapchat?
43

44
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,060
So who is shaping the conversation in your market or at least 
in a related market and has some headway in Snapchat?
44

45
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:05,420
Well, ideally, if you know of someone that uses your 
product, well, that's generally a great place to start.
45

46
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:09,660
Someone with an interest in your product or your 
kind of product also works. Whoever you pick,
46

47
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:13,610
there should be a logical connection 
between your brand and theirs.
47

48
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,590
If you've created an app to find 
the nearest dog park in your town,
48

49
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:20,800
well, then an influencer who has a dog 
will obviously make a lot of sense.
49

50
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:26,220
If you created an app to improve productivity on the go, 
then someone that's constantly traveling would also
50

51
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,170
be a good pick.
51

52
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:29,900
But also just try to make sure 
that you get a personality match.
52

53
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:35,280
If you pick someone who's wild and wacky and cusses
all the time, then it might not make sense for
53

54
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,660
your brand if you're not also the same. Part of your 
research before you do this should be to follow them
54

55
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:44,450
and check out their content, see what kind of impression 
they might actually make with their audience.
55

56
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:48,660
Once you have someone in mind, approach them and 
start a conversation. Let them know what you have in
56

57
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:54,770
mind and see if they'd be open to a takeover idea. If they've 
done one before, that could help set expectations.
57

58
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:59,610
Make sure you have a clear idea of what you would 
expect from them, what kind of freedom or access you're
58

59
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:03,360
willing to give them, and what you 
hope to accomplish from all of this.
59

60
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:07,210
And you might tell them, "Hey, come 
to our office and go wherever you want,
60

61
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,560
talk to anybody, but at some point come 
down to where we're making the product.
61

62
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:13,500
We have a cool idea for showing 
the process" - something like that.
62

63
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:18,000
Or it could also be like, "Hey, we'll be rolling out our 
new product at this event, and during these three
63

64
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,360
hours we want you to, you know, take over 
the account and do snaps and videos about,
64

65
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,150
I don't know, anything you want." Whatever it is,
65

66
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:26,400
be sure to set any limits you feel are necessary.
66

67
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,840
"Please don't talk about any competitors," for example, 
or "Don't mention this product we haven't released yet."
67

68
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,150
"Please don't talk about any competitors," for example, 
or "Don't mention this product we haven't released yet."
68

69
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,150
But before you get all bossy and tell them what you want,
69

70
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:35,980
understand that this is generally thought of as a collaboration.
70

71
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,550
You ask them for a reason.
71

72
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,670
They've got a following.
72

73
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:41,010
So pick their brain and ask for their input.
73

74
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:42,710
They know what their audience wants.
74

75
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,040
"What would you want to do?"
75

76
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:48,990
"What would you think would be fun or a great surprise 
or a giveaway that we could do?" The more involved
76

77
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:53,960
they feel, the more they'll probably be willing 
to do this to make sure that it's a success.
77

78
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:57,250
Now, if you come to an agreement and this 
takeover thing actually is going to happen,
78

79
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:01,580
make sure you prepare some important things 
before it goes down. First of all, establish a point of
79

80
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:06,800
contact with them, so if they have any questions before, 
during, and after, they know that they can get a response
80

81
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:07,580
pretty quickly.
81

82
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:11,570
You don't want them to go haywire not knowing what 
they're supposed to be doing for this time period.
82

83
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:15,160
Next thing is figure out how to get 
in touch with them during it
83

84
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:16,860
if you're obviously not physically with them.
84

85
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:22,180
So if something weird happens, you can actually 
contact them and hopefully correct the mistake.
85

86
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:26,120
What you want to do is create a temporary password 
so they can access your account, and then after the
86

87
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,340
takeover is done, change that password.
87

88
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:33,170
Now, if your takeover person happens to share your password 
with anyone in the process, who knows who that might be,
88

89
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:34,330
Now, if your takeover person happens to share your password 
with anyone in the process, who knows who that might be,
89

90
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,820
well, it's only going to last for a certain period of time.
90

91
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:41,060
The most important thing to do before a takeover is 
to promote this thing. Get on Snapchat and your other
91

92
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:43,580
channels and spread the word at least a week in advance.
92

93
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:48,770
And then, again, maybe like a few days before, the day 
before, and the day of. Let people know exactly when
93

94
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:53,540
it's happening. Maybe create a teaser telling people a 
takeover is happening and tomorrow you'll reveal who it is.
94

95
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:54,360
it's happening. Maybe create a teaser telling people a 
takeover is happening and tomorrow you'll reveal who it is.
95

96
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:57,940
Then, with the reveal, you share the date 
and time, and obviously start counting down.
96

97
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:02,840
Also let your influencer know in advance you'll help 
them come up with promotional information if they
97

98
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,170
need it for their channels.
98

99
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:09,260
That's a polite way of saying "We expect you to promote 
this too and I'll write the stuff myself if I have to."
99

100
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:09,830
That's a polite way of saying "We expect you to promote 
this too and I'll write the stuff myself if I have to."
100

101
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,560
You want to see them promoting this as well.
101

102
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:15,170
Hopefully they do it a week in advance
like you did, and if it doesn't happen,
102

103
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,950
well, you can politely check in and ask them to do it.
103

104
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,400
Once the takeover actually begins,
104

105
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,160
don't obviously freak out.
105

106
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:25,090
It should be a lot of fun or at least an interesting experience.
106

107
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:28,040
Watch their snaps and videos and look for reactions.
107

108
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:33,470
Ask your influencer to make note of anything interesting 
that comes their way, like comments or other interactions.
108

109
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:34,250
Ask your influencer to make note of anything interesting 
that comes their way, like comments or other interactions.
109

110
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:37,810
If possible, ask them to take 
a screenshot of them for you.
110

111
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:43,040
This can be really helpful data to understand how 
people reacted to the takeover. If possible, shadow
111

112
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,960
them and answer any questions, provide any info,
112

113
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,290
do whatever you need to make 
the takeover a success. After that,
113

114
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:52,780
just talk to them, check out the reactions 
online and talk to your own people.
114

115
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:55,790
How do they think it went? What worked? What didn't?
115

116
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,850
Do you actually see an increase in followers?
116

117
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:03,710
Did those followers end up bouncing and seeing 
your own web page or whatever your goal was?
117

118
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:07,750
Then take what you've learned and try to 
plan some more takeovers in the future.
118

119
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,330
In general,
119

120
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:13,370
first time you do this, it's probably not going to be very 
successful, but second or third time, you will know
120

121
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:14,050
what you're doing.
121

122
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:17,690
Equally likely, you figure out that, hey, this 
is a lot of work and it's not worth doing.
122

123
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:18,550
That's fine.
123
