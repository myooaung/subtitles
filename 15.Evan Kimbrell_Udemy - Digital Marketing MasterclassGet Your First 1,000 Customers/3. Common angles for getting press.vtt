Hey guys, welcome back to the course.
1

2
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.820
All right, so we've just started the PR section of 
the course, and in the last lecture we talked about
2

3
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:10.020
what it's like to be a reporter. If you can recognize 
what their life is like and have a little bit of
3

4
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:11.880
empathy for the job they're trying to accomplish,
4

5
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.290
it should make it significantly easier to approach 
them in the hopes of getting a little press coverage
5

6
00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:18.780
for your little product or your little company.
6

7
00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:22.740
Now, remember how we said in our last lecture that reporters 
are always looking for something interesting to cover?
7

8
00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:23.570
Now, remember how we said in our last lecture that reporters 
are always looking for something interesting to cover?
8

9
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.470
Well, in this lecture, I want to give you some tips on 
how to provide somewhat interesting pitches and
9

10
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.700
ideas to reporters when you do get 
to that point of approaching them.
10

11
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.350
So reporters are always on the lookout for topics 
that are relevant and timely. Relevant means it is
11

12
00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.820
important to the writer and their audience, and timely 
means they have some interest in it specifically right now.
12

13
00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:42.420
important to the writer and their audience, and timely 
means they have some interest in it specifically right now.
13

14
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.510
Next week, maybe not so much.
Next month, who knows?
14

15
00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.160
Next week, maybe not so much.
Next month, who knows?
15

16
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.590
Whether you're trying to get a reporter to write about 
your product or company or some idea that might
16

17
00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.150
involve you, if you can't offer something relevant and timely, 
you need to think up something else to pitch them.
17

18
00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:54.770
involve you, if you can't offer something relevant and timely, 
you need to think up something else to pitch them.
18

19
00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:01.290
So let's say you do have something relevant and timely,
well, then chances are ten, maybe a hundred other
19

20
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.690
people have similar ideas.
20

21
00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.700
Well, that's just unfortunately the way it is.
21

22
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.410
There's not a lot of completely new ideas out there.
22

23
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.540
If you and all of those other people are 
pitching the reporter of the same idea,
23

24
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.280
it's going to be tough to get noticed in that crowd.
24

25
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.690
Now, the difference maker here is if you give a 
reporter a unique angle that will make your specific
25

26
00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.930
idea stick out from the crowd and be a little more interesting.
26

27
00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.290
So what kind of angle am I talking about?
27

28
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.830
One angle to consider is the "I'm special and unique" angle.
28

29
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:28.340
OK.
29

30
00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.160
Like I just said,
30

31
00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.270
coming up with something completely special 
and unique can be tough to do these days.
31

32
00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:39.090
So instead just look for one way your idea or 
your product or your service is special and unique.
32

33
00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:45.330
Maybe your productivity app is specifically for doctors 
or maybe you offer web design services for free
33

34
00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:46.710
to local charities.
34

35
00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.430
What is your product's angle? Your unique angle might 
also be about how you got to where you are today.
35

36
00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.750
Maybe you raised money, took part in an incubator,
brought on a CEO to run the show, who knows?
36

37
00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:57.780
Maybe you raised money, took part in an incubator,
brought on a CEO to run the show, who knows?
37

38
00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.490
Everyone's story is different, but it's about finding 
those differences that can mean, well, the difference
38

39
00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:08.250
between getting noticed or not. Finding a new 
angle can also help if you tie it into a trending topic.
39

40
00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.860
Remember that reporters like interesting and timely topics.
40

41
00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.050
Well, nothing's more timely than something 
people are talking about right now.
41

42
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.350
If you could somehow tie this into a trend, 
well, then you can get a reporter's attention.
42

43
00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:26.970
Maybe a new study or some new data came out that 
shows customers are using mobile apps a lot more to
43

44
00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.530
accomplish specific tasks like finding 
local shopping places or ride sharing.
44

45
00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:35.370
Well, if you have an app that does one of those things 
remotely, you might have an opinion on the findings
45

46
00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.210
or have some stories and data to share 
that could either confirm or go against it.
46

47
00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:43.950
Reporters are always looking for things that can 
affirm their story or be the counter argument.
47

48
00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.870
This kind of angle is especially valuable to a writer because
it's a piece of research you're providing for them.
48

49
00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:49.480
This kind of angle is especially valuable to a writer because
it's a piece of research you're providing for them.
49

50
00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.090
Now, on the flip side though, another angle
you could take is an opposing position.
50

51
00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.850
If there's a current trend, opinion, or issue looming 
over your industry, consider the other side of it.
51

52
00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.840
Some writers out there might be biased, meaning they have 
their own opinion and are looking for ways to reinforce it.
52

53
00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:04.710
Some writers out there might be biased, meaning they have 
their own opinion and are looking for ways to reinforce it.
53

54
00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:10.100
However, many reporters usually like to cover all 
of the angles of the story, so think of it that way.
54

55
00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.610
Think about a best practice and then turn it on its 
head. Maybe while other local startups are investing
55

56
00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:20.700
in help platforms that use email, you've decided to make 
your support channel zero email and 100% video chat.
56

57
00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:21.240
in help platforms that use email, you've decided to make 
your support channel zero email and 100% video chat.
57

58
00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:27.330
Maybe everyone's working too much and you have 
decided that everyone in your company is going to have
58

59
00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.820
unlimited vacation days, although it's not novel anymore.
59

60
00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.700
Maybe you're like Team Treehouse, 
where they only work four days a week.
60

61
00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.700
That would absolutely get press.
61

62
00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.470
That is actually certainly unique and it captures 
part of a trend right now, because currently right
62

63
00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:47.130
now everybody is talking about how Silicon Valley tech 
startups and just Fortune 500s in general overwork
63

64
00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.530
people and overglorify overwork.
64

65
00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.420
So right there, there's a few angles.
65

66
00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.160
Make sure it's really relevant,
66

67
00:03:53.160 --> 00:04:01.110
try to find some way you can use your information, 
your data, or your story to affirm or deny a current
67

68
00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:06.400
trend, or just find some current trend that 
you could possibly kind of piggyback on.
68

69
00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.580
Or, of course, then just try to find something unique 
about your product. Your entire product is
69

70
00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.430
probably not unique, but there's probably something 
specific about it that is. And there's more angles
70

71
00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:15.670
out there as well.
71

72
00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:20.630
Consider a tactic you use in your startup and propose 
what might happen on a national or global scale if
72

73
00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:21.640
other people adopted it.
73

74
00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:22.650
Or do the opposite.
74

75
00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:27.720
Identify a global trend and then think about what 
could happen if you applied it to your business. Or
75

76
00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.450
actually try it and then offer the story as a lesson.
76

77
00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:36.220
There are many, many angles out there that are just 
there for you to find, hidden in interesting stories.
77

78
00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.910
It's all about your perspective and what
you could offer from a different angle.
78

79
00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.610
If it's interesting, well, then there you go, you have 
something to work with. Alright, guys, we'll cover more
79

80
00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:45.800
angles in our next lecture, but let's break for now.
80

81
00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:47.160
angles in our next lecture, but let's break for now.
81

82
00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:47.590
See you then.
