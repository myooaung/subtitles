Hey guys, welcome back.
1

2
00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:08.190
Now, you might have noticed that the last 20 lectures or
so have been a non-stop roller-coaster ride of scrappy
2

3
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:13.160
promotion strategies, and this
section looks, well, not like that.
3

4
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:19.410
This section, we're going to take a pause from the non-stop
promotion to do something that is really vitally important.

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.160
This section, we're going to take a pause from the non-stop
promotion to do something that is really vitally important.

6
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.950
Is it redesigning your logo? 
6

7
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:22.810
No.
7

8
00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.700
Is it to find a back alley social media specialist?
8

9
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:32.040
No. It is to set up analytics on your
site so you know what is working.
9

10
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.490
Data nerds, rejoice.
10

11
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.950
Yes, we are going to talk about
how we track what is working.
11

12
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.810
This course is meant to be a big buffet of tactics.
12

13
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.990
Once upon a time, I was a young lad in a college that
would invite speakers to come inspire us and tell
13

14
00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:47.610
us how they built their business.
14

15
00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.890
My favorite one by far, despite the speaker sounding
like he spoke three languages, but really could only
15

16
00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:59.610
speak one, was a man I won't name, who said, "The
secret to business is finding something that works, and
16

17
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.250
then you just do that a lot."
17

18
00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.040
Pure poetry. And while that man is, on an unrelated note,
currently in prison, his wisdom still rings true today.
18

19
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.530
Pure poetry. And while that man is, on an unrelated note,
currently in prison, his wisdom still rings true today.
19

20
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:09.290
And guess what?
20

21
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:15.060
You can't really grow your business in a systematic
way if you have no idea what you're doing that's
21

22
00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.770
bringing in the sales.
22

23
00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.380
It could very easily be the case that nine of the 10
things you're doing are having absolutely no impact
23

24
00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.080
at all and are a waste of time.
24

25
00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.420
That's why we need to take a break and
get acquainted with the basics of analytics.
25

26
00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.760
Once we start tracking who is doing what, we'll then be
able to narrow down on which techniques are bringing
26

27
00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:39.330
in the most people, the right people, and where we
should then focus our energy. We'll cover tools like
27

28
00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:45.150
Google Analytics, Mixpanel, and Kissmetrics, we'll go
through how to use the free version of Google Analytics
28

29
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.650
and interpret that spaghetti of data that it throws at you.
29

30
00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:55.680
And then, last off, we'll go over ways of using linking tricks to get
even more of a granular understanding of what's working.
30

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:56.870
And then, last off, we'll go over ways of using linking tricks to get
even more of a granular understanding of what's working.

32
00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.310
See you in the next lecture.
