Hey guys, welcome back to the course and welcome to the first lecture in our how to get press or PR section.
1

2
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:10,440
Now if you're looking for the CPR section Well that's down the hall to the left.
2

3
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:13,840
So why exactly are we going to talk about press and PR.
3

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:19,250
Well PR is a legitimate tactic that you should consider for your business now.
4

5
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:24,810
Not every single business out there is perfect for getting press however you'd be surprised at how easy
5

6
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:31,050
it is for some of the less interesting companies out there to get coverage in some way or another.
6

7
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:33,620
The great thing about press is that it's essentially free.
7

8
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:38,520
I mean sure you spend time on working on relationships with journalists or finding different angles
8

9
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:45,270
or pitches or outlets but once you have that done you get exposure to thousands and thousands of people
9

10
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:47,430
who have never heard of you beforehand.
10

11
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:52,500
And the reason why I'm going to tackle this first up and our Get your 500 section is because the amount
11

12
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:57,300
of effort compared to the reward in PR is still very very good.
12

13
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:01,640
It does definitely take a couple days worth of work at least.
13

14
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:05,430
But the gains you can get could easily outsize.
14

15
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:10,260
How much time you spent and you can easily get 500 or more customers by doing this.
15

16
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:17,040
Even if you don't get press though I think it's worth understanding how blogs news and other media outlets
16

17
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:23,790
especially things online work how they think and how to better understand them for the future when you
17

18
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:24,910
might actually get it.
18

19
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:31,380
Now PR stands for public relations but it really should be called press relations because that's really
19

20
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:32,560
what it's all about.
20

21
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:38,250
Now our focus is on finding members of the press and other people out there who write about your industry
21

22
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:44,100
or just have large followings if you can find the right media people out there with influence or big
22

23
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,890
audiences and you can get them interested in you.
23

24
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:51,750
Well then it's not really that much of a stretch to say well you can usually get them to write about
24

25
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:54,600
you or include you in something they're writing.
25

26
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:59,100
Now Prescot help spread the word about what you're doing what products you have coming out and especially
26

27
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,880
by reviewing the stuff you have and then publishing articles about it.
27

28
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,760
And now the press that I'm talking about can take many different forms.
28

29
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:10,990
One thing you really need to keep in mind when I say press I don't just mean the New York Times.
29

30
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:16,010
Now obviously I do mean New York Times Wall Street Journal Huffington Post things like that.
30

31
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:20,100
But I also mean several other things.
31

32
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:23,320
Now it's not just newspapers like in the old days of PR.
32

33
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:29,430
It's really anyone with an audience now that could be news sites that could be blogs that could be editorials
33

34
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:35,810
that could even be like popular podcasts or popular shows.
34

35
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:40,920
For us the lowest hanging fruit are probably going to be the blogs since there's a lot of them they
35

36
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:46,490
have a lot of sway and they can be pretty tailored towards one specific type of customer or topic.
36

37
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:53,650
So how exactly does getting press for your startups or small business or for just your project work.
37

38
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:57,840
Well we're going to cover the fundamentals in this section and talk about how to research and identify
38

39
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,350
members of the press out there that can help you.
39

40
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:06,480
How didn't pitch those members of the press on your story or a similar story that might possibly fit
40

41
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,690
you into it and pretty much anything that stands a chance of getting picked up.
41

42
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:14,280
They weren't talking about how to create a press package that pulls together all the info the press
42

43
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,270
needs about you to increase your chance of actually being covered which is to talk a little bit about
43

44
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:24,150
how to maintain relationships with these contacts over time how to make sure they don't wilt and make
44

45
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:27,370
sure that you can use them in the future if they don't cover you now.
45

46
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:29,170
Now keep this in mind when it comes to PR.
46

47
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,490
Well PR is a growth channel attraction channel.
47

48
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:36,580
Now you usually aren't going to be doing PR efforts all the time marketing.
48

49
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,210
Yes but PR not so much.
49

50
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:44,850
Now when you have an announcement or an update or a launch and PR can help you generate some traffic
50

51
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,320
and conversation spikes.
51

52
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:50,810
But to be honest outside of that you're going to get press occasionally.
52

53
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:54,210
And I do have to give you this warning it doesn't make sense for everyone.
53

54
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:58,860
In some cases what you have is it's not inherently press worthy and you're going to have a significantly
54

55
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,570
hard time getting covered.
55

56
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:05,740
Now it's my opinion that everyone can get covered in some way or another.
56

57
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:10,280
However for some people depending on what you're selling the novelty of it.
57

58
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:16,320
What milestones are actually interesting facts you have about it or how it fits into a larger trend.
58

59
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,500
Well it might just be harder for you.
59

60
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:23,620
So much so that I personally would skip to the other parts of this horse because I think the our allies
60

61
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,780
are any better there now.
61

62
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:29,820
Here are some situations where I think it makes sense to actually go after press.
62

63
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:37,500
So if you have an awesome product and it's already being used by at least a small but vocal happy customer
63

64
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:42,960
base and it's not just a concept of an idea or a product that you haven't been able to get customers
64

65
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,970
for even yet in this course.
65

66
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:49,410
Another one is if you have specific media outlets that you want to reach like industry blogs or sites
66

67
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:51,820
that would really help you a lot if they wrote about you.
67

68
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:58,560
Three if you have a social or nonprofit type of angle to your business this is actually opens the door
68

69
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,510
quite easily for making a story.
69

70
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:04,090
If you have people besides yourself that you can actually dedicate to it.
70

71
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,550
Now PR can be a lot of work.
71

72
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:12,220
So if it actually starts working out for you it's going to be good if you can find someone to help at
72

73
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:16,470
least automate some of the process if you're OK with your efforts not working well.
73

74
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:24,250
PR is very much a coin flip chance unbiased unprejudiced
74

75
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:30,960
media people are not always interested they're not always available and if they write about you want
75

76
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,710
it doesn't guarantee they're gonna write about you again.
76

77
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:39,230
They're also notoriously kind of capricious like you don't know what they're going to do or say or how
77

78
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:39,790
they act.
78

79
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:45,290
So just keep that in mind it doesn't always work does not replace marketing it supports it.
79

80
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:47,620
Now if you don't have time for PR that's fine.
80

81
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:50,120
And I won't hurt my feelings if you skip the section.
81

82
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:55,280
But if you're ready to do the PR thing you think that there's at least something noteworthy about your
82

83
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,580
product or your service.
83

84
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:00,530
Well then let's keep watching this section and you'll learn about the steps about creating your own
84

85
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:04,790
press list pitches press kits and then how to nurture relationships.
85

86
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:06,230
All right guys I'll see you in the next lecture.
