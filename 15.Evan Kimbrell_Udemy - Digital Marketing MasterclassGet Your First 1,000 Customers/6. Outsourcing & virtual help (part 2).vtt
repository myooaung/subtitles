1
00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.470
OK we are back.

2
00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:02.390
Hooray.

3
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.640
Last Lecture we covered the way of planning your outsourcing strategy.

4
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.960
Are you going to get someone with perfect English who only needs limited direction and has all the skills

5
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:10.490
in the world.

6
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.720
Or maybe someone who don't speak to good but really only has basic skills and therefore you can save

7
00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.530
a little money with that insight and hand let's move forward to finding where these people are now.

8
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.950
There are a lot of places you can go to find editors but I'm going to suggest the ones that work for

9
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:30.900
me and where I go back to time and time again when I need people for post-production.

10
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:37.290
Now the first one is good all up work that God awful Frankenstein e Lance mushed together with oDesk.

11
00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.150
The second site is a site called Video pixies worth checking out.

12
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.980
The third one you might have heard of already.

13
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.510
Not one is called fiber fiber is seriously like a Swiss Army knife of websites.

14
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.720
Now if you're not in my outsourcing courses let me introduce you to the first one up work.

15
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.750
Now upper BC is the largest online marketplace for finding contractors of virtually any sort.

16
00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:01.110
No you're not going to find a contractor to fix the leaky faucet.

17
00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:06.400
You probably would use thumbtack for that but you can find any contractor that can work online virtually.

18
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:13.080
And that means programmers virtual assistants writers researchers designers engineers lawyers even accountants

19
00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.770
and yes video professionals.

20
00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.330
Yes people who work in video like to be referred to as video professionals.

21
00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.950
But if you really want to be PC you really should refer to them by their more acceptable name.

22
00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:28.080
Little professionals Ulbrich is a monster of a market and they literally have millions of freelancers

23
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.190
on their system.

24
00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.420
This is usually like go to first when looking for editors.

25
00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.860
Here you can find a range of prices a range of capabilities and a range of communication abilities.

26
00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.700
In fact 4 out of the 5 video editors I work with today are from work originally.

27
00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.690
Now the way I use the site is pretty simple.

28
00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.050
Sign up post a job and then fill out the relevant information for the job posting it will ask you what

29
00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.510
skills are relevant to your position and you have the option of leaving this blank.

30
00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:57.030
And if you do that's perfectly fine but if you decide to actually list out the skills you need and keep

31
00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.800
in mind that the system will actually paying more people and you'll get more people to apply and then

32
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:02.700
choose from.

33
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.810
If you just want a timeline added other then just type in the name of common video editing software

34
00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.300
is like Adobe Premiere Final Cut Pro Sony Vega and then whatever.

35
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.250
Try something generic like video editing.

36
00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.860
Now if you want more complicated skills and try some generic ones but then also add in some things like

37
00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.330
animation or YouTube or Adobe After Effects.

38
00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.830
Apple motion or even motion graphics anything frankly you can find that would fit in the ballpark of

39
00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:29.850
who you are looking for.

40
00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:36.480
Generally just try to find some software they use or some specific thing they do within that specialty

41
00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.150
and then chances are that you'll find the people you're looking for.

42
00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.350
Now people will bid and then submit will they call cover letters which are basically just written statements

43
00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.540
as to why they're interested in the gig and usually they're just templates.

44
00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.680
But from there you can actually message them.

45
00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.890
One thing I strongly suggest to do after posting on opera is actually to go to that section where you

46
00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.800
can search for freelancers.

47
00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:00.590
It's big surprise under the header freelancer's and click on that and you go to find freelancer's.

48
00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.380
So go ahead and input the information you're looking for.

49
00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.690
Use the same specifications used in the job posting to narrow your search down.

50
00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.390
Then just go through this and and look for people that match your criteria and click invite to apply.

51
00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:16.290
You'll get a message directly asking them to apply and in the vast majority of cases they actually will

52
00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:16.880
apply.

53
00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:22.500
If you spend 5 to 10 minutes doing this you'll easily get three times as many applications and you honestly

54
00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.870
don't have to customize these at all just clicking like apply and apply.

55
00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:26.650
They get the point.

56
00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.230
It's like a place worth talking about is video Pixi which operates very similarly to up work but is

57
00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.180
focused solely on video professionals.

58
00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.140
With this site you'll be asked to input more information about where you are in the process of your

59
00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.700
video what you'd like in your video how long it is etc. etc..

60
00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:45.630
Nothing too surprising but I will point out that video Pixi is number one generally going to be more

61
00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:51.270
expensive and number two it serves as a platform to find all types of video professionals not just video

62
00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.960
editors.

63
00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:56.610
If you need a videographer also known as that person who goes with you to the shoot and operates the

64
00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:59.160
camera then you can find that there as well.

65
00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.150
Video Pixi has its ups and downs.

66
00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.280
Generally speaking you'll get a better sampling of editors from expensive countries and more impressive

67
00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:11.770
portfolios and fewer from editors that are just starting out or might be in less traditional countries.

68
00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:16.050
Of course you'll get both types I'm just saying that there is usually a skew to the former because of

69
00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.280
that.

70
00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:20.960
I usually only use video Pixi if I know I have a modest budget to get this done.

71
00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.200
If I want to scrap my way through an editing job without spending much on a much better shot at finding

72
00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:31.200
the right combination of help on up work however up work I might not find people who are as polished.

73
00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.780
Personally I'd suggest trying both and seeing what you like more.

74
00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:38.040
Now the last place worth taking a peek at is a little counterintuitive and it's called Phifer.

75
00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:39.570
Oh sweet sweet Fire.

76
00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:44.520
Fire is spelled with two r's for some reason if you don't remember the site where you can buy one off

77
00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.350
services for $5 or always some multiple $5 fiver.

78
00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:52.370
Believe it or not it's actually a good place to find video editors and especially animators.

79
00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.630
How does that work exactly if you're just using the site to pay $5 at a time.

80
00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:01.830
We'll actually part of the reason people offer their services on firers because that $5 might not be

81
00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:06.600
much but there's a good chance that they'll turn you into a long term client which does in the end pay

82
00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:07.650
off for them pretty well.

83
00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:12.880
So in that way it's actually pretty normal fish for editors here to find people here it's pretty straightforward.

84
00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:17.970
Search for what you're looking for like edit a video if you want some generic or add graphics or graphics

85
00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:23.100
editor or use verbs like animate or custom animation to find people with skills and animation go through

86
00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:27.510
the list you receive and just watch the portfolio videos when you see someone you like.

87
00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:33.030
You can either just messes them Dellec directly about the larger job or try ordering a smaller job for

88
00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:37.910
a small party or video or video series first and see how they do the do well.

89
00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:41.400
Then at that time you can just ask them if they want to do work on all the others.

90
00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:45.360
That is actually the preferred route of doing this because otherwise you're just going to waste a lot

91
00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:45.810
of time.

92
00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:47.790
Onboarding someone that you find out you don't like them.

93
00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:50.210
Now you can use the fiber pricing system if you want to.

94
00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:55.020
And if it's applicable to continue paying them or you can just ask to pay them off of fiber and then

95
00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.930
you can set up a direct relationship using Paypal or whatever.

96
00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:02.910
Now fiber is a goldmine for editors because for whatever reason five are kind of became Ground Zero

97
00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:06.140
for that explainer craze that happened over the last five years.

98
00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:10.530
Every person with a Web site that for some reason they needed an explainer video and thus a glut of

99
00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:14.130
cheap video animators flocked to fiver to offer their services.

100
00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:18.840
The beauty though is that because they're in a marketplace compared to each other the competition has

101
00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:21.470
driven their costs down significantly.

102
00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:27.060
That means you get people that are cheap as $5 for half a minute of animation which is absolutely crazy

103
00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:29.170
by the standards of work or video Pixi.

104
00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:33.840
The thing is if you're making a lot of videos say you're doing a series or a course or something similar

105
00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:38.610
you have a lot of video and if you try to use animation throughout hours of video well that can get

106
00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:44.850
extremely expensive if you're in that situation and you insist on needing animation then try fiber.

107
00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:48.920
So those are the three that should meet all your needs up work video Pixi and fiber.

108
00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:49.770
OK that's great.

109
00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:50.600
You know where to go.

110
00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:53.490
Well you might not know especially if you're new to video.

111
00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:55.660
How do you go about selecting the right person.

112
00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:58.560
Well there are a couple obvious things you'll use at first.

113
00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:03.300
Number one they all will have portfolios attached to their bid or at least on their 5 page.

114
00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:06.940
Just look through it and see if it matches what you're looking for.

115
00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:11.340
If they don't have any videos that are similar to the format of video you're trying to make then try

116
00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:16.200
your best to judge whether you think the quality of the other stuff is something close to what you're

117
00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:16.860
looking for.

118
00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:21.900
Chances are if they make something you like well they can probably make it for whatever format you're

119
00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:23.010
looking to fill.

120
00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:26.880
Now the other thing right off the bat you'll look for is what we talked about last lecture.

121
00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:30.940
Are they in your sweet spot with regards to price communication skill and skill set.

122
00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:35.370
If they're not well then you can save yourself time by just skipping over that person with those two

123
00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:35.760
checks.

124
00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:39.510
You can usually narrow your selection down to a smaller group of people.

125
00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:39.930
Great.

126
00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:44.680
Now here's what I do to get the extra mile and really see if they're worth working with.

127
00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:50.100
If I'm working on a large project with multiple videos I ask them to do what's called a trial video

128
00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:52.170
much like an audition for an acting role.

129
00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:58.440
You can ask them to do exactly what the job is for but just for a really really small limited selection

130
00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:03.450
in this situation you'd simply grab a piece of your video try to keep it small enough to not take a

131
00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:07.530
significant effort but long enough that will actually give you an idea of whether or not they can do

132
00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:08.020
the job.

133
00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:11.200
And then just ask them to do a trial video if they're OK with it.

134
00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:16.770
Now in most cases as long as this is for a big multi video project they'll be fine with it.

135
00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:20.010
In some cases you might want to offer to pay them for the test video.

136
00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:25.290
Just knowing that it will get more participation by the editors and the amount you'll pay out is usually

137
00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:27.540
negligible compared to the greater project.

138
00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:32.460
Some editors can be weary about doing these because maybe they get burned in the past or something or

139
00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:32.940
whatever.

140
00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:36.230
So yeah sometimes you can offer just like a flat rate.

141
00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:42.060
Now for talking about making say a video ad or a promotional video then this technique probably isn't

142
00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:43.080
really going to fly.

143
00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:47.970
The follow up project probably isn't big enough for the editor and the trial itself would require too

144
00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:48.750
much work.

145
00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:52.280
In that case I generally just like to give them a question or two about the video.

146
00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:57.720
Ask them what they think of the idea you have for the video or ask them how they would edit something.

147
00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:03.750
I use this verbal task just as a general way to see whether or not the person is articulate enough that

148
00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:05.730
I know working with them will be easy.

149
00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:10.500
And it also gives you an idea of what their attitude in general is like some editors think they are

150
00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:14.640
holier than thou and can't be bothered to do anything unless they're being paid.

151
00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:17.580
Those people suck don't hire them they're never worth it.

152
00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:22.890
Hire someone who doesn't act or think in such a transactional way and who actually shows they can think

153
00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:25.430
about your project you're vetting them for.

154
00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:29.490
Also it doesn't hurt if they're somewhat interested in what they're doing and not just doing it for

155
00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:30.270
the money.

156
00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:34.300
If you break down your vetting process this way you'll usually come away with an obvious winner.

157
00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:39.750
If not then either try again or just accept the fact that you might have to take on risk by hiring the

158
00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:44.130
closest thing you can find on the bright side you can usually tell very quickly if they're not going

159
00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:47.300
to work out in which case you can just start the process all over again.

160
00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:51.960
The last thing I'll mention is and this is kind of a curveball but occasionally you get some really

161
00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:54.090
good values by posting on Craigslist.

162
00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:59.400
I know this is bizarre and there's no system for managing the process with them or their relationship

163
00:09:59.400 --> 00:09:59.810
with them.

164
00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:02.980
It if you're smart about it you can handle it fine.

165
00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:07.580
Usually what I like to do on Craigslist is post in the gig section there's a section specifically for

166
00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:08.660
video editing services.

167
00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:13.550
I can't remember how many it is but you can find it's pretty obvious what you can do is what I like

168
00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:19.160
to do is post in areas like L.A. because in L.A. there's a ton of people who do video editing and in

169
00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:21.870
fact a lot of them don't have enough stuff in their portfolio.

170
00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:26.200
So a lot of them are pretty flexible on price and they're also pretty talented.

171
00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:28.130
That's kind of the Mecca for like video editing.

172
00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:29.480
All right guys that's enough of that.

173
00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:32.730
Hopefully you knew what to do when you need an editor.

174
00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:33.710
See the next lecture.
