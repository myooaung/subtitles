00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:09.830
And we are back for part 1 of 4 of section 2 and
course number 15, which is taught by me, who is a 10.
1

2
00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:10.810
You get the point.
2

3
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.620
As a reminder, if you have already done quite a bit of
research on your customers already and maybe already
3

4
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:23.730
have, say, a large batch of sales, one, why are you
taking this course? And two, feel free to skim through
4

5
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.510
this section or just skip it. For the rest of you, growth
5

6
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.200
flunkies, we're taking it way back to the basics, so
that we can understand how to sell our business
6

7
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.870
and connect with our customers.
7

8
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.900
We're going to talk about pain. *Pain.* Pain.
8

9
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.580
It's what your mom might say if you
asked her what it was like to raise you.
9

10
00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.560
It's that thing that's silently knocking over all of our old people,
and it's the sole reason anyone ever buys anything.
10

11
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:47.720
It's that thing that's silently knocking over all of our old people,
and it's the sole reason anyone ever buys anything.
11

12
00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:48.050
Yes.
12

13
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:53.640
Anyone who has ever bought something, whether it's
a face sized iPhone 7S or a veggie burger, was in
13

14
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.730
some way reacting to a pain they have. In the first case,
it's the pain of not being able to hide in plain
14

15
00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.550
daylight while making a phone call,
15

16
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.750
and the second, the pain of being beaten up by vegan
gangs down the street because you might have indulged
16

17
00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:07.900
in a turkey burger.
17

18
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:09.070
Those flesh eaters.
18

19
00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.580
All joking aside, any product or service you can think
of can be tied back to a pain or frustration or
19

20
00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.790
inconvenience that someone has. Taxis, for instance,
are slow, expensive, obnoxious, and more likely than not
20

21
00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.310
to wreck in any given 15 minute drive.
21

22
00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:30.390
That is a pain. Who solves that wholly or partially?
Well, ride sharing apps like Uber, Lyft, and the Chinese
22

23
00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:36.570
knockoff companies of those two, which we'll call Fuber
and Fyft. What pain does Zinga address with Farmville,
23

24
00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.750
besides the pain of having an uncluttered news feed?
24

25
00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.380
Well, actually, they target the pain of boredom.
25

26
00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.670
Specifically, we're talking about the pain of boredom,
the loneliness of playing a game by yourself, and
26

27
00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.130
the cost of buying a console to play a game
27

28
00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.200
traditionally. Sprintkick, for instance, my development
agency, tackled the pain of "it's hard to build
28

29
00:01:55.230 --> 00:02:01.830
a custom application," and templated platform
systems like SquareSpace or Wix don't give really
29

30
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.010
enough control or customization that I need.
30

31
00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:10.200
Also, the pain of not wanting to pay US prices and the frustration
that comes from managing and communicating
31

32
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.120
with traditional outsourced firms.
32

33
00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.440
Now, a lot of you might think that there are in fact
companies out there that simply don't address pain
33

34
00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.880
points at all, but instead are just
"wouldn't it be cool if?" companies.
34

35
00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.180
The point is, whatever you're doing,
there is something you are reacting to.
35

36
00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:30.320
It might not be the case that you've thought much
about it, but well, that's why we're doing it now.
36

37
00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.190
If you don't know the pain or frustration you solve, then
you won't know how to communicate to your potential
37

38
00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:41.390
customers to convince them that my solution solves
your pain and is worth what I am asking in return.
38

39
00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.930
So how do you figure out what pain you are addressing?
39

40
00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:50.550
Well, for one, if you already have made a sale, you can
take a shortcut to this answer and just ask your customers.
40

41
00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:51.200
Well, for one, if you already have made a sale, you can
take a shortcut to this answer and just ask your customers.
41

42
00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.440
"Why did you buy this?" Or 
"Why did you sign up for this?"
42

43
00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.940
You'll generally get a response that relates to
a problem or some kind of an issue they had.
43

44
00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:06.570
If the response is instead something along the lines
of "I just thought it'd be neat to X, Y, and Z," then
44

45
00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.750
really all you have to do is ask a follow up question.
45

46
00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.650
"Why would doing X, Y, Z be useful?"
46

47
00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.040
And that usually gets the answer you want.
47

48
00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.660
If you don't have customers yet, well, there are a
series of three questions I want you to ask yourself,
48

49
00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.800
preferably out loud. "Why did I start
this business in the first place?"
49

50
00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.150
The most classic example of why someone starts a
business is because they want to solve something, and
50

51
00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:32.220
it wouldn't be a solution worth making if there wasn't
a problem or pain point there to begin with.
51

52
00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:38.070
The next question to ask yourself is, "When someone
uses this product or business, what do they benefit?"
52

53
00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.090
Is it cheaper, faster, better quality?
53

54
00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:47.130
Well, once you determine what exactly the theoretical
benefit is, you can look back for the inverse of it.
54

55
00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.420
Well, once you determine what exactly the theoretical
benefit is, you can look back for the inverse of it.
55

56
00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.570
If you're service, for instance, is faster, well then
you might be solving the problem that getting this
56

57
00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:54.380
task done traditionally takes too long,
57

58
00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.220
or maybe they don't have enough time for it.
58

59
00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:02.160
If it's cheaper, then you're probably solving the
pain point of something being too expensive.
59

60
00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:07.200
Now, the last question I want you to ask yourself is,
"Are there substitutes for what I'm trying to do?
60

61
00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.390
And if there are, how do my potential
customers feel about using them?"
61

62
00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:16.970
Opening a restaurant? You are servicing hunger
and there are many ways to address hunger.
62

63
00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:22.290
How do you think people feel about eating what essentially
amounts to foam core covered with tomato sauce,
63

64
00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:23.760
also known as DiGiorno's?
64

65
00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:28.470
In the next lecture, and also attached to this lecture as a
resource, you'll find a worksheet for you to follow along with.
65

66
00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:29.630
In the next lecture, and also attached to this lecture as a
resource, you'll find a worksheet for you to follow along with.
66

67
00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:35.110
I want you to take that sheet and just record separately
in a document the answers to these questions.
67

68
00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:40.110
At the end of the sheet, you'll write out the pains
or frustrations you think your business or product
68

69
00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:45.980
targets, and then lastly, you're going to rank them
based on what you feel are the biggest ones. All right,
69

70
00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:47.580
we are moving on to the next lecture.
70

71
00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:48.030
See you then.
