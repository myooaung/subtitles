Hey guys, welcome back to the course.

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.320
So, in the last group of lectures, I introduced you and we 
went through the ins and outs of Snapchat, how it works,

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.000
So, in the last group of lectures, I introduced you and we 
went through the ins and outs of Snapchat, how it works,
3

4
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:13.900
how to do takeovers and run promotions,
where they hide the stash of IPO money.
4

5
00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.710
Snapchat is still a platform that 
marketers are trying to figure out,
5

6
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.160
and Instagram is very much the same kind of story.
6

7
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.810
Even though Facebook bought it for a bazillion 
dollars, rough term, it was actually a billion dollars,
7

8
00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.600
Instagram is still plowing ahead, amassing hundreds 
of millions of new users every few months now, and
8

9
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.620
as a percentage, Instagram is growing quite 
a bit faster than their parent, Facebook.
9

10
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.940
So why is it that marketers are still 
trying to figure out Instagram?
10

11
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.580
Well, Instagram is like Snapchat,
built to post images and videos.
11

12
00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.470
You can leave snarky comments and hashtags,
you can like stuff, you can connect with friends.
12

13
00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:51.410
A lot of common tasks are done here, but people
love this platform because it's so straightforward.
13

14
00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:57.240
It's a never ending scrolling feed of pictures of all 
kinds. You have professionally shot and posed selfies
14

15
00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:02.760
from celebrities, you have terribly lit awkward 
angle selfies from complete strangers,
15

16
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.250
then you have things like pictures of cats, pictures 
of events, pictures of cars, food, and outfits.
16

17
00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.380
Then you also have videos of people doing funny things, 
stupid things, adorable things, and again, videos of
17

18
00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.570
cats - the list really could go on forever.
18

19
00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.950
Instagram is also well known for being 
what's considered like a lifestyle platform.
19

20
00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:26.520
People who post on Instagram generally curate their 
life more and more, therefore lifestyle brands are
20

21
00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.070
particularly successful on this platform.
21

22
00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.390
Why?
22

23
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.550
Because everyone uses it to kind of show 
off a little bit, like "Hey, look at my life,"
23

24
00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.790
whereas Snapchat is more extemporaneous,
24

25
00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.370
it's like "Look at this crazy thing I just saw."
25

26
00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:41.220
Is it worth posting it for everyone to see forever?
26

27
00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.640
No, but it's interesting enough that you can
watch it for nine seconds and it disappears.
27

28
00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.950
Now, I mentioned a while back about 60% of Instagram users 
are under 30 and a third of its users are in their 30s and 40s.
28

29
00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.740
Now, I mentioned a while back about 60% of Instagram users 
are under 30 and a third of its users are in their 30s and 40s.
29

30
00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.920
Now, why do so many young people use it?
30

31
00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.890
Well, many of them use the platform as a kind 
of photo journal, a way to document their lives.
31

32
00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.870
Whether it's a selfie or a shot of their outfit of the day,
Instagrammers will post just as many random shots
32

33
00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:05.410
from their lives as Snapchatters will,
33

34
00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:11.880
but instead of that picture flittering away into 
digital nothingness 9-15 seconds later, it's instead
34

35
00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.430
stored as a visual timeline,
35

36
00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.380
a way to look back and see a 
creative and personal journey.
36

37
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.360
Plus, you don't have to write much. Instagram
37

38
00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.730
focuses on the visual, meaning you don't have to spend 
a lot of time coming up with thoughtful things
38

39
00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.770
to say or hammering out X number 
of words to get your point across.
39

40
00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.240
Simply take a picture, post it, and voila, you're done.
40

41
00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.520
Yes, you have to write a caption, but that really
doesn't take long, around 30 seconds.
41

42
00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:35.040
The one advantage Instagram has over Snapchat is 
that it's much easier to find people and brands.
42

43
00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.070
The one advantage Instagram has over Snapchat is 
that it's much easier to find people and brands.
43

44
00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:45.120
Its search is more logical and usable, and you can 
mention and tag other Instagram accounts in your
44

45
00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.920
pictures and descriptions. In Snapchat, 
you can't actually do that. As an app,
45

46
00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.020
pictures and descriptions. In Snapchat, 
you can't actually do that. As an app,
46

47
00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:54.150
Instagram is very easy and straightforward, even though 
it doesn't have as many fun features as other apps, like,
47

48
00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.780
Instagram is very easy and straightforward, even though 
it doesn't have as many fun features as other apps, like,
48

49
00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.220
you know, the lenses that Snapchat offers. Now, 
the other advantage is with advertising. Instagram
49

50
00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.290
advertising runs off of Facebook's ad network, so 
there's actually a lot of opportunities to advertise
50

51
00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.630
with a picture, video, or story. For brands, it makes the platform 
and its users much more accessible than the other ones.
51

52
00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:10.580
with a picture, video, or story. For brands, it makes the platform 
and its users much more accessible than the other ones.
52

53
00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:12.780
But, of course, it's going to cost money.
53

54
00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.800
They're a little bit more mature. Now, beyond those 
paid efforts, using Instagram to organically build
54

55
00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.430
your audience and grow your customer numbers 
is still a mystery to a lot of marketers.
55

56
00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.420
Besides posting pictures, what am I supposed to do?
56

57
00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:24.370
What can I do?
57

58
00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:29.910
Well, the upcoming lectures will talk about setting 
up Instagram for your business and some tactics to
58

59
00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.520
use to get more customers.
59

60
00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.800
So stay tuned and we'll dive right in.
