00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,300
Hey guys welcome back to the course.

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:07,770
So in the last several lectures we talked about a whole lot of different ways that you can come up with

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:14,190
ideas for your blog or whatever online content you want to stick into your content marketing plan.

4
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:20,430
So maybe you've looked through the list of supposedly great ideas you have so far and you're working

5
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:24,330
on them right now or maybe you've got something written and it's ready to be published.

6
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:24,680
Great.

7
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:30,150
Well when you publish your content what essentially that means is it's now available for people to see

8
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:30,940
online.

9
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:36,930
It exists somewhere and really kind of stating the obvious point here because many people publish their

10
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,810
content and then they think yes I did it.

11
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,640
I'm done.

12
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:41,960
I don't have to do anything more.

13
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:47,250
And then they just move on to writing the next thing or they go play Call of Duty or something I don't

14
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:48,540
know what you do after that.

15
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:49,170
Here's the problem.

16
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:52,110
Just because you publish something doesn't mean people know it exists.

17
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,100
That whole building.

18
00:00:53,130 --> 00:01:01,470
And they will come slogan from Field of Dreams doesn't exactly apply well to content marketing.

19
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:11,720
Somebody that's you have to tell your audience about what you've got.

20
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,800
Kind of it's kind of like feeding cats.

21
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,270
Cats don't really care about anything but themselves.

22
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:20,780
They're just a bunch of self-centered goals that do really whatever they want whenever they want.

23
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:21,990
Much like your audience.

24
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:23,900
You have zero control over them.

25
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:27,090
Now if you walk in the same room as a cat holding a big can of tuna.

26
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:27,670
Yeah.

27
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,180
They'll continue to ignore you but the moment the sound of that canned opening hits the air those cats

28
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:32,900
will come running

29
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:37,420
terrible metaphor.

30
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,080
Yeah I know.

31
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,600
My point is if you publish something you need to make some noise about it.

32
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:44,970
Part of your content strategy must include promoting your content as well.

33
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:46,290
Just like Toona.

34
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,390
So in this lecture I'm going to run through this steps on how to promote your content will cover some

35
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:56,790
things that do when you promote on social media and also talk about how you can approach and even work

36
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:00,310
with industry experts or influencers or whatever you ought to call them.

37
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,200
Those are the people who can help you promote when the time comes right to share your stuff promoting

38
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,240
your content is a necessary step.

39
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,900
So my hope here is to help you create a process.

40
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:09,620
You can repeat.

41
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:14,900
Every time you publish something in general it's a good idea to have a set playbook.

42
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:19,290
Every time you publish something because you don't want to be reinventing the wheel every time you hit

43
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:23,790
publish on a new blog does not address the fact that are a million different ways you can promote your

44
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:27,800
content online than what has gone to growth hackers dot com.

45
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:33,510
Literally every single day there's probably 10 different ways or new ways that you can promote what

46
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:34,660
you've written.

47
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:40,520
We're going to cover are some of the more classic more everyday ways of promoting it.

48
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:46,320
And these are kind of the bedrock of your promotional strategy feel free to add in more of those accessories

49
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:52,380
or more of those eccentric styles of promoting your stuff later on when you get a better grafs of the

50
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,070
basics.

51
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:53,830
Zounds good.

52
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:54,180
All right.

53
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:55,020
Let's discuss.

54
00:02:55,020 --> 00:03:00,000
So just to be clear when I say promote your content what I mean is you tell people about your new piece

55
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,060
of content people who might be interested in it and potentially in a bunch of different places and perhaps

56
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:12,060
you might actually end up doing it by making a whole lot of smaller pieces of content that are chunked

57
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,210
up from the larger piece that you wrote.

58
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:15,440
I'll explain later.

59
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,500
So this could mean tweeting about it.

60
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,880
You could write up Facebook posts you can post on LinkedIn.

61
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:23,520
You can do Instagram or you can even retrofit it for youtube.

62
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:28,900
Maybe you could use something on Reddit or any other half dozen platforms.

63
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:33,500
It also means sending updates out in an email newsletter but each time you promote your piece that's

64
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:35,820
a little new piece of content you're creating.

65
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,950
Now could be 140 characters or something more.

66
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:42,300
But each one does take time and effort to complete.

67
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:47,870
Unfortunately you cannot just write the one promotional line that works for Twitter or Facebook that

68
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:52,270
works for a medium that works for your email that works for everything.

69
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:53,950
The world is much harder than that.

70
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:59,140
This is why promoting content to me feels like more work than it really is and you might agree.

71
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:03,240
You might have to go to all these different Web sites or apps just to get the word out about your new

72
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:08,340
stuff while you feel the same way you want to check out some most social media scheduling tools to help

73
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,590
you save time and effort.

74
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,420
Now you could use a scheduling platform to plan tweets Facebook posts and more.

75
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:17,970
And while you can also Prioleau those platforms with tweets about your company and your products or

76
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:18,840
whatever.

77
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:23,700
To me the real value here comes when it comes time to promote your new stuff.

78
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:29,070
You only have so much time in your day or your social media intern only has so much time in their day

79
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:34,620
so you dont want that to be taken up by are remembering that it's three o'clock now I need to post for

80
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:38,700
the third time on Facebook and at 3 dippie 3 I need to post again on Twitter.

81
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:44,700
No other reason why I really liked the social media scheduling applications like a buffer or like a

82
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:45,120
meet.

83
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:51,990
Edgar is that in general if you want to be successful when you promote your content well you need to

84
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:57,540
promote it multiple times in similar places and not just once.

85
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:02,990
Now if you tweet about your new blog posts one time say he did it on Tuesday at 10 a.m. Eastern Time.

86
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,340
Well there is a chance that anyone on Twitter at that time that is also following you will see it but

87
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,990
those people are not generally enough.

88
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:17,070
You just put 2 percent effort into promoting it compared to the 98 percent you already spent on writing

89
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:17,220
it.

90
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,440
You're not doing it justice.

91
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:23,730
Now the same idea applies for all social platforms so it's become an accepted best practice schedule

92
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,550
a series of social posts beforehand.

93
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:33,390
Now you might do two posts on the day you publish and then one day for the next five to seven days.

94
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:38,010
Now this would ensure your audience whenever and wherever they get on line has a much better chance

95
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:43,500
at seeing your promotional message with a scheduling platform this task becomes way easier for you to

96
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,010
handle.

97
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:49,320
Now there are two really good platforms that I think you should probably check out and I just mentioned

98
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,640
them briefly before the first phone call buffer.

99
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:54,730
You FFE are on the second one is called Meet Edgar.

100
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:59,970
So if a scheduling platform can help you address the problem of getting seen by your audience it doesn't

101
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:03,150
guarantee that they'll click or share what you put out there.

102
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:07,130
Now you need to create a promotional message that's somewhat eye catching.

103
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:12,060
Now a helpful tip for making that happen is to use custom images by custom image.

104
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:16,980
I'm talking about graphics that you can create specifically for this one piece of content.

105
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:22,530
Now it could be a picture you take with your phone something you put together with a free tool like

106
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:23,300
Kanva.

107
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:27,870
Or you could even use like a paid tool like Photoshop or Illustrator if you have any idea how to use

108
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:28,200
those.

109
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,780
They're really complicated here.

110
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:35,440
Up on the screen is a custom image the content marketing insitu made about this topic.

111
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:38,300
Nine brilliant ways to promote your blog on Facebook.

112
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:41,360
How Mehta why would they put an owl right here.

113
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,540
Well because owls as everyone knows are brilliant.

114
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,870
You can see has glasses come on you know that Al is extra smart.

115
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:51,740
Als are just those guys in class that always set the curve anyway.

116
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:55,310
Now compare this to a stock photo image of an owl or what.

117
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:58,970
Do a lot of places use when they share a listicle.

118
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:06,530
Probably a close up shot of a checklist or somebody writing some really really boring like stock photo.

119
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:12,800
So obviously a stock photo at a glance when a custom image like this one with the owl catches your eye

120
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,790
and you can quickly see what it's all about.

121
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:18,430
And there is science behind the use of images to support this.

122
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:22,760
Probably a research done by a very smart owl.

123
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:28,480
Probably really if there's anything I can.

124
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:34,550
My research tells us that posts with images get something like two to three times more engagement than

125
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:35,990
posed without images.

126
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:37,850
That's why I've anyone follows my Twitter.

127
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:42,870
I always attach images to my tweet even if they have nothing to do with what I'm talking about.

128
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:46,590
So try to find something relevant and try to find something eye catching.

129
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:49,170
It will dramatically increase your reach.

130
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:54,950
So so far I've mentioned a social media scheduling tool so you can promote multiple times and I just

131
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:56,930
mentioned the use of custom images.

132
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,080
These are both important steps you should take for promoting your content.

133
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:02,800
But there's one more thing you can do that will help.

134
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:08,320
If you've mentioned any web sites or people in your content contact them and let them know about it.

135
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:11,990
Any time anyone gets mentioned in a piece of content they didn't create themselves.

136
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:13,410
Well that's pretty cool.

137
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:18,530
People love to hear about that and a lot of them would gladly share a link to it to show how cool they

138
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:19,190
are.

139
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:26,150
So if you cite any sources link to any outside content or quote some expert make sure that the source

140
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:29,650
knows about it when you publish to put it another way.

141
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:34,310
While you're writing your piece think about ways you can link out and mention other people in your industry

142
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:36,970
especially those with bigger followings than you.

143
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:42,080
Presumably everyone knows actually leads into another kind of strategy for promoting your content and

144
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,070
that is to work with influencers.

145
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:46,490
Now I'm going to cover that in the next lecture.

146
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,930
So we get into it.

147
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:48,740
I'll see you then.
