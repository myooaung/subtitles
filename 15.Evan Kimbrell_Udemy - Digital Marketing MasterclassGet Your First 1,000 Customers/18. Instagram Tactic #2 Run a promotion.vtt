Okay, guys, welcome back to the course.
1

2
00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:06.750
So our last lecture we talked about the power of hashtags 
and how you could use them to drive engagement
2

3
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:07.920
on your Instagram post.
3

4
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.720
Well, promotions are another way to get engagement.
Promise people something cool and then ask them to
4

5
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:14.240
do something in return.
5

6
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.750
So let's discuss Instagram promotions in this lecture.
Back in out lecture about running a promotion in Snapchat,
6

7
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:19.440
So let's discuss Instagram promotions in this lecture.
Back in out lecture about running a promotion in Snapchat,
7

8
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:20.940
I mentioned two kinds of promotions
8

9
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.370
you might consider. You could give away a prize 
to a random user, this is called a giveaway,
9

10
00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.510
you might consider. You could give away a prize 
to a random user, this is called a giveaway,
10

11
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.740
You could also give away a prize to a user who you 
choose based on some criteria or skill - best comment,
11

12
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.790
funniest video, worst selfie, best photo 
including your product, whatever.
12

13
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.660
This, on the other hand, is called a contest. Well, you could 
easily conduct a giveaway or a contest in Instagram as well.
13

14
00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:42.690
This, on the other hand, is called a contest. Well, you could 
easily conduct a giveaway or a contest in Instagram as well.
14

15
00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.180
Plenty of brands do. A health and beauty company 
in the UK called Superdrug uses Instagram to post
15

16
00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.960
pictures of the products they sell,
16

17
00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.500
and a lot of those pictures are of makeup.
17

18
00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.440
One giveaway they did was this one. "Tag a friend and 
you both could win a goody bag filled with all the
18

19
00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.230
new products featured in this picture.
19

20
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.550
We will announce the winner at 5:00 PM today. Good luck.
20

21
00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:03.120
We will announce the winner at 5:00 PM today. Good luck.
21

22
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.960
#win #giveaway." The picture is a great 
one because it shows off the merch.
22

23
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.670
But other great thing is that they hashtagged it 
with #giveaway. If you're curious what people
23

24
00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.510
on Instagram are doing with contests and giveaways, 
well, then look no further than those hashtags, 
24

25
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.090
#contest and #giveaway.
25

26
00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.890
So for those of you who are looking for ideas for how to
run your own promotion, there's thousands of them. So
26

27
00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.750
that Superdrug example was a classic
27

28
00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.520
"tag a friend" Instagram promo. By tagging a friend,
28

29
00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.750
yes, you give them a chance to win as well,
29

30
00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.730
but for Superdrug, well, it provides them with more leads,
30

31
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.070
people they can reach out to on 
Instagram to expand their following.
31

32
00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:42.690
If you did a promotion like this, I'd look at every one 
of the people mentioned by their friends in the
32

33
00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:44.580
comments and then follow them all.
33

34
00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.040
You're bound to get a decent number of followers 
back and more engagement in the future.
34

35
00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.780
Giveaways are fairly simple to pull off.
35

36
00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.350
The requirements are usually really easy.
36

37
00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:55.290
"Like this picture," "Tag a friend," 
"Follow us" or something like that.
37

38
00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.860
"Like this picture," "Tag a friend," 
"Follow us" or something like that.
38

39
00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:03.780
Generally, the lower the barrier to entry, the better. 
People posting a photo of themselves is good and
39

40
00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.520
it's nice to repost those because it looks organic 
and it looks like they really love your product,
40

41
00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:15.330
but also just asking to tag someone or to repost it or 
retweet it, pretty effortless and it gives you free exposure.
41

42
00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.330
but also just asking to tag someone or to repost it or 
retweet it, pretty effortless and it gives you free exposure.
42

43
00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.880
Some contests will require all three of those, liking
the picture, tagging a friend, and following you.
43

44
00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.740
So consider how important it is for you to get 
that extra like. In the Superdrug example,
44

45
00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:32.880
all they asked for was to tag a friend and it got over 250 
comments, but it also got over 6,000 likes without even asking.
45

46
00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:33.600
all they asked for was to tag a friend and it got over 250 
comments, but it also got over 6,000 likes without even asking.
46

47
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.160
So make your giveaway fun and you won't 
have to ask for all that engagement.
47

48
00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.010
Just get what you really need,
48

49
00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.620
new leads for Superdrug in this case, and 
then just move on. Instead of a giveaway,
49

50
00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.330
new leads for Superdrug in this case, and 
then just move on. Instead of a giveaway,
50

51
00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:49.860
you could do a contest, for example. You could suggest 
a theme or idea, tell people to post a picture with
51

52
00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.090
that idea in mind,
52

53
00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.820
use a specific hashtag so you can find it, and you'll 
pick the five best pictures to win a free account
53

54
00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.040
for a year or something.
54

55
00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.750
Maybe you sell air conditioners and you post
55

56
00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:00.720
"Summer is here. What's your 
favorite way to beat the heat?
56

57
00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:02.370
"Summer is here. What's your 
favorite way to beat the heat?
57

58
00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:03.990
Post a pic and tag it with, I don't know, #CoolestSummerEver."
58

59
00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.550
Post a pic and tag it with, I don't know, #CoolestSummerEver."
59

60
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.840
Something obviously like that, although you probably
want to brand your hashtag to ensure every post
60

61
00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.270
with it applies to your contest, so, you know, if you sell 
air conditioners, maybe your company is called
61

62
00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.390
Air Solutions, or, I don't know, something like that,
62

63
00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:23.370
so in that case you could create the hashtag #AirSolutionsSummer or #SummerSolutions, something that plays
63

64
00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:24.060
with your brand.
64

65
00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.360
Play with it and go with something unique and memorable.
65

66
00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.900
If necessary, search Instagram to 
see if anyone else is actually using it.
66

67
00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.480
Just go to the search screen, click on Tags, 
and you just do the search to know for sure.
67

68
00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:38.690
As for your contest, running a photo 
contest is a natural fit for Instagram.
68

69
00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:42.820
There's lots of creative people out there, 
so give them something fun to do.
69

70
00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:49.000
A radio station in Baltimore ran a summer selfie contest 
with weekly prizes and a branded hashtag that
70

71
00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.210
got over 90,000 entries.
71

72
00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:57.090
Selfies are like the easiest pictures to take, so doing 
a selfie contest of some kind, like a shot with
72

73
00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.090
your product, is a very easy kind of contest to do as well.
73

74
00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.920
Now, a clothing retailer for young women called Nasty Gal, I don't 
know if you've heard of them, they're actually pretty well-known
74

75
00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:10.230
in the startup world, took a photo contest idea a step 
further and partnered with the musician Courtney
75

76
00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.840
Love to give away a trip to L.A..
76

77
00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:18.150
That's a little far fetched, but if you 
have the budget, it can work.
77

78
00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:19.380
The instructions were basically,
78

79
00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.060
"Post a picture of your favorite female 
artist, explain why she inspires you,
79

80
00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:29.130
with a specific branded hashtag, then tag Nasty Gal in the picture. 
They got something like 13,000 likes and plenty of entries.
80

81
00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:29.940
with a specific branded hashtag, then tag Nasty Gal in the picture. 
They got something like 13,000 likes and plenty of entries.
81

82
00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:34.920
If it's possible to partner with another account to 
do a bigger giveaway, well, it's worth considering.
82

83
00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.060
Data shows that the bigger the prize,
the more engagement you can get.
83

84
00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.400
Of course, be realistic with this.
84

85
00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:39.570
Of course, be realistic with this.
85

86
00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:41.570
Why would you give away $5,000 worth of stuff if
86

87
00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.120
you only have 100 followers?
87

88
00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:49.260
You probably want to incrementally move up. Start with something 
really small and cheap and then keep moving up the scale.
88

89
00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:50.970
You probably want to incrementally move up. Start with something 
really small and cheap and then keep moving up the scale.
89

90
00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:56.100
The thing with these advertisements and 
these contests is that they're great return
90

91
00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:02.890
on your money. Giving away something in return for 
thousands of likes or thousands of shares, per dollar,
91

92
00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:04.440
that's a fantastic investment.
92

93
00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:08.530
Anyway, so you might use a hashtag for your 
contest, but be sure to also include a few generic
93

94
00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:11.350
ones as well, like #contest or #giveaway,
94

95
00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:12.810
whichever one applies.
95

96
00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:16.780
Some people on Instagram are just searching for free 
stuff and will click on posts with that specific tag.
96

97
00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:17.490
Some people on Instagram are just searching for free 
stuff and will click on posts with that specific tag.
97

98
00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.180
More engagement could lead to more 
followers and shares of that contest.
98

99
00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:25.230
Part of your promotion should also include 
a great picture announcing the contest.
99

100
00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.320
If there's a prize you can show, 
well, then snap a picture of it.
100

101
00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.440
People will see that picture first and 
then want to know how to get it.
101

102
00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:35.020
Use text on the image to get even 
more details in front of their face.
102

103
00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:40.440
Like, for instance, "Win this phone" is simple enough. 
Now, every promotion needs official rules.
103

104
00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:41.710
Don't skip this step.
104

105
00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:43.500
You always have to define the rules.
105

106
00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:46.600
Now, let's just go over the common 
details. Similar to Snapchat,
106

107
00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:50.460
Instagram has guidelines you need to 
review before you run any promotions.
107

108
00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:53.790
Instagram cannot be directly involved 
with your giveaway or your contest.
108

109
00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:57.530
You cannot say it's sponsored by them, approved 
by them, sanctioned by them, whatever.
109

110
00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:58.260
You cannot say it's sponsored by them, approved 
by them, sanctioned by them, whatever.
110

111
00:05:58.270 --> 00:05:59.610
It's got nothing to do with them
111

112
00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:01.320
and that's the way you have to keep it.
112

113
00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:04.660
You are responsible for ensuring that 
the promotion is legally put together,
113

114
00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:07.180
that rules are set out and enforced, and all that.
114

115
00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:10.240
My general suggestion is to follow the best practices.
115

116
00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:15.040
Look at what other people are doing, and usually they're doing
it correctly, so just make sure that you're in line with them.
116

117
00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:15.960
Look at what other people are doing, and usually they're doing
it correctly, so just make sure that you're in line with them.
117

118
00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:20.920
If you're really risk averse, you could probably ask a 
lawyer or ask someone who's done these before
118

119
00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:22.810
and see what guidelines they followed.
119

120
00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:28.240
So once you pick a winner, post about it and congratulate 
your winners, tag them, share their winning
120

121
00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.390
pictures or whatever they did to win.
121

122
00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.900
Encourage everyone to follow you if they already haven't
122

123
00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:35.540
so they don't miss the next giveaway next month.
123

124
00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:39.850
Make plans and get people ready to anticipate 
more fun stuff from your account.
124

125
00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:43.990
Be sure to use the same hashtags, 
like #contest if it makes sense for you.
125

126
00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:46.220
Now, above all, have fun with the contest.
126

127
00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:50.530
If you're already looking at running a promotion as 
a big pain in the ass, maybe you're not thinking
127

128
00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:52.420
of a contest that's a good fit for you.
128

129
00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:54.440
Promotions come in pretty common forms,
129

130
00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:59.380
the photo contest, the like, follow, tag type contest,
but think about things your audience would like to see,
130

131
00:06:59.380 --> 00:06:59.860
the photo contest, the like, follow, tag type contest,
but think about things your audience would like to see,
131

132
00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:03.840
want to comment on, or be competitive 
about to drive them to take part.
132

133
00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:04.280
All right, guys.
133

134
00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:06.480
That's pretty much it for promotions.
134

135
00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:11.860
Try to incorporate this into your promotional 
schedule, they're pretty easy to pull off.
135

136
00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:13.690
You just have to decide to run a promotion,
136

137
00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:18.970
figure out what your giveaway is, and then just make 
sure that your giveaway matches the size of your
