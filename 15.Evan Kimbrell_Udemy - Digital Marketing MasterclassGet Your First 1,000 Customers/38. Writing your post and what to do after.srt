00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:01,710
Hey guys welcome back.

2
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:06,810
All right so we're in the homestretch here in our talk about guest posting now that we've research places

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:11,880
we might want to write for and we've contacted those places and we've gotten our awesome pitch approved.

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,300
Well now what do we do.

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,670
Now it's time to actually write this thing when your pitch gets approved the blog or web site might

6
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:22,530
send you along some like boiler plate type information that they copy and paste into an email back to

7
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:22,760
you.

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,710
That might include basic guidelines like make sure your blog post has a word count of such and such

9
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:31,100
number or falls within a specific range.

10
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:33,660
There's a pretty easy guidelines so please don't ignore it.

11
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:37,560
They might say make sure your post is original and has not been published elsewhere.

12
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:40,260
They request this than whatever you write needs to be new.

13
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:44,190
Don't include more than one link to your own website and the body of the post.

14
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:50,730
Now some sites won't care if you link to your Web site if you link multiple times and others are more

15
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:51,390
serious about it.

16
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:55,860
Some will take them at all and some are kind of in the middle like this or they'll say you can only

17
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:00,520
do it once but I'm Dymes they don't want posts that look ultra promotional because you you know put

18
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:03,620
a dozen links to different dozen different product pages.

19
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:10,770
In fact I have seen some of the companies just reject articles because you pitch something or mention

20
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:13,140
something and it was too obvious and well guess what.

21
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,450
That's their prerogative.

22
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,540
I didn't really lose a lot of sleep over it.

23
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:18,820
Besides you probably have a bio anyway.

24
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:23,940
So then you can usually mention what you're working on are oftentimes linked to your site.

25
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:27,770
You might also see something like don't include screenshots of the product.

26
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:31,680
If there's branding of any kind in it because it is under these sites what they allow.

27
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,780
Much of these rules have to do with maintaining a certain level of quality.

28
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,320
Secondly the quality expected by their leaders and followers.

29
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,260
Remember you're writing for them not you.

30
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:45,300
So another tip to remember is you need to meet the expectation of that Web site's audience.

31
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,610
Now some blogs will provide tips for this.

32
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:50,080
They'll share links to posts that have performed well.

33
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:54,750
They might highlight topics or concepts that the readers want more information about the blog might

34
00:01:54,750 --> 00:02:00,690
even give you a suggested format like provide at least one industry example or end it with an open ended

35
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:03,330
question the readers can answer in the comments.

36
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:08,020
If you're unsure just go through the blog yourself and look for posts that have generated a lot of engagement.

37
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:12,210
There might be some ideas right there and you can grab for yourself to make your post more appropriate

38
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,070
for that specific audience.

39
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:19,050
In fact helpful way to improve the focus of your post and to earn some brownie points.

40
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:23,660
The editor of the blog to add links to recent posts on their blog.

41
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:29,280
In your post since this will be going on their site anyway it makes sense for you to link to other posts

42
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,680
and help keep readers on their site.

43
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,500
For example I wrote a post about e-mail open rates and giving tips on how to improve them.

44
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:42,390
Perhaps you can find a couple of posts on their site that touch on the same topic or related topics

45
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:46,190
like recommended email platforms or email design tips.

46
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:50,400
If you're going to mention these topics anyway linking to those older posts can make your posts look

47
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,340
like it belongs on the site and also gives the editor more reasons to like you.

48
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:59,100
Now once you start writing your posts you need to do something else really important stay focused on

49
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,200
whatever the pitch is you provided.

50
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:04,800
This might seem obvious but again it's a pretty common mistake.

51
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:09,030
Once your post gets approved just don't change your mind or switch things up because you thought of

52
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:10,260
something better.

53
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:14,580
Stick to the idea description the talking points or whatever it is that you provided.

54
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:20,060
Some current event or breaking news affects your idea that you can always contact the blog or the editor

55
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:24,270
who ever responded to you in the first place then tell them how you'd like to change it and why.

56
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:29,010
If there's something related to the current event by the way then it's a good chance that I could generate

57
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:32,970
more traffic or engagement so sometimes that blog editors will go for it.

58
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:36,270
It also just depends on how many times you've written for this outlook.

59
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,580
First time you might not be able to get away with it.

60
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:39,910
You've done it several times.

61
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:44,580
I don't know when you got a finished draft remembered or view your post to make sure you met all of

62
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:45,270
those guidelines.

63
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:46,950
Can't say this enough word count.

64
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:52,560
Links visuals whatever it is that they've stipulated and review the content to make sure that it matches

65
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,270
your pitch.

66
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:58,200
What is a little bit of obvious information is that Meeke should include a bio for yourself with the

67
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,230
article you write.

68
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:04,620
The blog might give you guidelines about how you can display your information but try to at least get

69
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,940
the important stuff in there.

70
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:10,860
Things like a company name you owl maybe and your Twitter handle whatever it is that you want to drive.

71
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,240
The actual traffic too.

72
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:17,310
You've decided to gasp blog for reasons if you want to gain social followers for example and put your

73
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:19,380
social media handles in there.

74
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:23,390
Most editors are aware of this that people don't guess blog just for the fun of it.

75
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,800
So now by this point you should hopefully have a completed draft.

76
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:29,470
You'll have to submit it through whatever channel the blog tells you to.

77
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:31,230
Then you might have to play the waiting game.

78
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:35,560
Your post will probably go through some like editorial review meaning that people from the blog and

79
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:39,780
even go through it check for formatting check that it matches your style.

80
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:41,990
Check out the links that you used whatever.

81
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,870
If there are any issues with your post the editor might get back to you and then work with you.

82
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:49,030
It's actually pretty common that you go through a couple rounds of editing.

83
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:53,220
Now if your post gets approved you might hear back about when it will go up.

84
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,920
They might tell you a date which would be great.

85
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,810
Or they might say something some time next month.

86
00:04:57,810 --> 00:04:58,970
Again it's up to them.

87
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:04,750
But if you politely find out the date of your post that can actually help quite a bit with preparation.

88
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:08,690
Blogs will generally expect you to do a little bit of promotion yourself.

89
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:11,950
So it's pretty helpful to know when you need to do that.

90
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:17,320
Another key thing to keep in mind is that once the post is up make sure that you monitor the post for

91
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:20,470
comments and then participate when people have questions.

92
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:25,060
There are a lot of blogs out there that look for people that do this and they don't like it when they

93
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:29,830
have a dead beat writer who writes something then people follow up in the comments and they just disappear.

94
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:35,890
They like having people who nurture their audience so be sure to check it regularly at say pretty much

95
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:40,990
every day for at least the first seven days and then obviously in the comments don't try to be combative

96
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:46,480
or try to tell people that they're wrong just try to be constructive and thank people if they say what

97
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,490
you've written is good.

98
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:51,790
That goes without saying that people are disagreeing with you just be polite.

99
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:53,410
They might actually have a point.

100
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,390
Maybe they're just arguing for the sake of arguing.

101
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:56,980
That does actually happen.

102
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:01,990
Just remember this is not your blog or website you kind of have to act like you're a guest there so

103
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:04,510
behave you unsure of how to deal with someone.

104
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:09,610
And it's better just to check with the blog editor of the site owner and also don't just monitor the

105
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:10,930
blog posts for comments.

106
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:14,720
Make sure to look at where it's also been posted elsewhere.

107
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:18,700
Screen posted on Twitter it's me posts on Facebook see where the comments are there and also try your

108
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:19,740
best to participate.

109
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:23,890
If you use a tool like TweetDeck you use before you can actually set up custom feeds that tell you when

110
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:26,070
this post gets mentioned or shared.

111
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,460
One way to do that is pretty easy.

112
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:30,420
You just set up a search for the actual post title.

113
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:35,350
So if it's called Five Easy Steps improve your email open rights then you just search for that and TweetDeck

114
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:39,090
you'll see who is retweeted and perhaps find more comments that you respond to.

115
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:43,630
The last thing I would say that's pretty necessary to do is make sure that you send a thank you e-mail

116
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:45,040
to the person that you worked with.

117
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:51,970
I know it sounds old fashioned but it's a great way to end the relationship on a positive note because

118
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,700
let's be real.

119
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:55,970
You probably won't using them in the future if this actually worked out.

120
00:06:55,990 --> 00:07:00,430
The Post as well for them all that it's an easy way for them to reply back and tell you about it and

121
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:02,280
perhaps even ask you to write for them again.

122
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:07,390
So after all of this work research pitching writing or watching all that happens.

123
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:09,590
How do you know if all of this was worth it.

124
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:11,380
How do you define success here.

125
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:15,440
Well in order to see if you are successful you have to go back to your original goal.

126
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:17,740
Why did you decide to guest post in the first place.

127
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,750
Or why was this specific blog or web site your target.

128
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:23,890
Were you trying to raise your profile as a writer or expert.

129
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:28,330
Or are you trying to get your company or web site or product discovered by a new audience.

130
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:31,230
You look at your social followers and see if there is some kind of uptick.

131
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:35,930
But in reality unless there's a mega viral hit probably I can see a huge change there.

132
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:41,530
But in general you should try to monitor engagement looking for basic things like likes and mentions

133
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:44,470
and retreats and comments are quite a bit easier to spot.

134
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:50,800
One of the more concrete ways that you can track the performance of the posts you made is to just track

135
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,150
how many people click the link that's in your bio to go back to your page and you can either do that

136
00:07:55,150 --> 00:08:00,430
by adding like UTM parameters to the end of it and then looking at a Google Analytics or you can just

137
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:03,860
go to Google Analytics and sort by referral.

138
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:07,970
So referred from this site or this page that's generally a good indication.

139
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:12,610
So there you have it in the next set of lectures we're going to talk about ways in which you can promote

140
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:15,460
your content in order to reach as many people as possible.

141
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:21,210
Too many people forget about promoting the content as opposed to making it and I'll be honest with you

142
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:23,570
promoting is probably more important.

143
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:24,980
We'll leave you with that cliffhanger.

144
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:26,180
I'll see you next lecture.
