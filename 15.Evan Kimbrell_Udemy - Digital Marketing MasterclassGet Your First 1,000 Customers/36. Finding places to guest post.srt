00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,220
Hey guys welcome back to the chorus.

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:04,820
All right let's talk more about that concept.

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:07,600
We kind of just got into the last lecture.

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:08,460
Guess posting.

5
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:13,860
If you are interested in guest posting maybe you heard my last lecture and we're like now or maybe you

6
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:17,630
fell asleep on your keyboard and this is actually playing to the top of your head.

7
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:21,050
Then go ahead and skip the next couple of lectures.

8
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:24,700
Also you may be narcoleptic.

9
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:31,650
So once you've decided you want to write posts for other blogs and sites the next step is to find those

10
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:34,200
places interested in guest post.

11
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,810
Not every site wants them which is fine.

12
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:39,490
We don't need to be part of your popular table.

13
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,100
You just have to look around.

14
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:46,020
The first thing I think you should do is start with the blogs and people who already know or are familiar

15
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:46,380
with.

16
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:52,770
You might have an idea if you could write something that you couldn't see being posted at such place.

17
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:58,460
For instance if you're interested in marketing you might have stumbled upon a blog called business grow

18
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,460
by Mark something something for example.

19
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,410
Yes I know it's called business grow and not business growth but I'm assuming the extra two letters

20
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:11,330
in his domain are probably out of his budget or this is just a shameless play as CEO.

21
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:12,040
I don't know.

22
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,510
Anyway on his site mark and a group of guest bloggers write all about things.

23
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:22,260
Marketing So if you have some expertise and see marketing automation tools you might ask yourself the

24
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:23,130
question.

25
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:27,690
Could I write something about marketing automation that would fit in with all the other posts I see

26
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:28,260
here.

27
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:34,980
So then the question becomes would magical mark or marky mark or the owner of the blog owner is that

28
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:35,760
you're looking at.

29
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:39,060
Would they consider an article for their blog.

30
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:43,980
If you can create something good something that's relevant to the audience of the target blog and not

31
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:48,100
just your audience and the blog is open to submissions from guest posters.

32
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:52,230
Well then you have a great chance of having your posts being accepted and then the rest of it's really

33
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:54,000
just a mechanical process.

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,030
The easiest way to get a post accepted somewhere is through I'll admit personal connections.

35
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:03,570
I know that's not necessarily what you want to hear but sadly a lot of guest posts are done through

36
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,920
knowing someone.

37
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:07,770
So if you know the blogs owner that definitely helps.

38
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:12,810
It might be the case that maybe they've read your stuff already but regardless the probably more willing

39
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:15,570
to give you a chance than a place that doesn't know you.

40
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:16,610
Quick side note.

41
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:21,120
Most blogs will ask you for previous examples of your work.

42
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,410
Obviously they need to be posted somewhere not just in a Word doc.

43
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:29,720
So if you can get a couple of posts up it'll actually make this process a lot smoother.

44
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:34,560
Now beyond the people you know you'll need to do some digging to find guest post opportunities that

45
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,870
make sense for you.

46
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:39,780
You can start by just searching on Google and be specific when you search.

47
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:46,290
Start with the topic you want to write about and then add the keywords guest post or guest blogger or

48
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:51,120
maybe even marketing guest post or design guest blogger.

49
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,980
If you want to be more specific those searches can return results for sites that focus on those topics

50
00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:01,740
and either have guest post and that's why it picked up on the word guest and the keyword or are looking

51
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,800
for someone to participate.

52
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:08,730
If you're not finding the sites you want then you can try other search terms like writers needed guest

53
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:12,250
post guidelines right for us or blog for us.

54
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:13,710
And those should help.

55
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:19,350
Those key phrases are kind of a hack right because not everybody says we need guest bloggers but they

56
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:21,510
might have a button that says right for us.

57
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:26,670
That's a very common one you'll see on web sites are blocked for us or even just guest post guidelines

58
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,700
if they have a guest post guidelines link.

59
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:33,050
They probably take s post but that's not really all you can do with Google.

60
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:35,220
Sort of searching for those blogs that accept bloggers.

61
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:40,740
We can also search for the guest bloggers themselves and then reverse engineer this process to figure

62
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:43,210
out where they've gotten access to.

63
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,820
We don't even have to know their names for this to work.

64
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:46,130
All right.

65
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:46,830
Check this out.

66
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:50,880
Let's talk about to google for the sake of this example let's say you want to direct guest post somewhere

67
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,890
about your favorite subject search engine marketing.

68
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:55,350
That's your favorite thing in the world.

69
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:56,170
God save you.

70
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:59,810
Everyone says you're so good at that search engine marketing man.

71
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:05,640
You should write about it and I can see you're excited about it so here on Google you can type in search

72
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:11,600
engine marketing and then add in the addition of my guest post and close to zero.

73
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:12,530
I'm going with this.

74
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:18,180
We're looking for places where people literally talk about their guest posts on your topic and they

75
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:21,210
do all the time because guess bloggers guess what.

76
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:22,440
They promote their stuff.

77
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:28,620
Putting those quotations tells Google to search specifically for this phrase and not other loose variations

78
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:30,870
of it which can kind of get you down the wrong path.

79
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,560
So try out that search.

80
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:38,780
And here within the first results we've got where I contribute and guest post as CEO smartly.

81
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:39,410
So bingo.

82
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:43,620
That's what we were looking for so let's click through it and yeah here on this page.

83
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:44,040
Guess what.

84
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:48,990
We have a whole bunch of sites where and Smarty never heard of our writes about SEO related topics.

85
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,140
We have Internet Marketing ninjas for the Web site SU chat entrepreneur magazine crazy egg search engine

86
00:04:55,140 --> 00:05:01,410
journal and so on right there you've got a bunch of leads curated for you and if you can write as good

87
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,550
as this silly lady will then you have a good chance of getting in these publications.

88
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:10,260
So once she finds a promising Web sites or blogs you'll need to evaluate them to make sure they fit

89
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,080
your needs.

90
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:16,550
Chris metrics actually shared a pretty good four question list you can use to evaluate a blog or website

91
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:17,940
for guest posting.

92
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:23,430
So number one first question you should ask is that blog's content focused on the same topics you write

93
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:23,970
about.

94
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:28,770
Number two is that blog's audience interested in your industry now or three.

95
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:33,530
Does that blog have engaged readers like you know lots of comments and shares and in the last one in

96
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:39,630
number four is the blog owner active on social media such that they will share your posts and help you

97
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:40,490
promote it.

98
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:44,670
If the answer is yes to all of those questions well then you have a good opportunity.

99
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:48,260
If you're not so sure will try to figure out as much as you can.

100
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:51,210
Some sites will have guest post pages set up already.

101
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:52,650
Makes it easy for you.

102
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:53,790
Others will not.

103
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:57,840
That doesn't necessarily mean they don't guess PPOs do your best though and try to look through their

104
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,570
posts.

105
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,120
You can't find any information there.

106
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:07,020
Check out their contact page and you might have a form or section specifically for guest post inquiries.

107
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:11,310
Now here's an example of a site that's doing it correctly it's called right mix marketing.

108
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:14,280
I know there's tons and tons of these marketing websites that go on.

109
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:18,360
They've got a page set up for people interested in guest posting with info on who their audience is.

110
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,690
Topics they like examples of guest posts they have performed well.

111
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:25,520
Basic requirements how to submit and what happens after you submit it.

112
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:26,740
I think you right mix.

113
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:31,830
Now what if you've got your sites aimed really high and you want to contribute to a blog that's got

114
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,430
a really big audience.

115
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,400
It's like the Huffington Post for example.

116
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:41,080
Well sites like that also have their own requirements and unique processes for submitting work of PPOs

117
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:41,910
the cool kids call it.

118
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:47,640
I actually asked you to send them a finished draft of your post and in peer lingo we called that on

119
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:52,080
spec if you don't remember that you need to send that along with an idea for the title your name.

120
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,220
You have to give a bio and a couple other pieces of information.

121
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:58,710
If pitching your idea like this doesn't interest you that's OK.

122
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:04,320
Do more research and you'll see there are other ways to do it but unfortunately some places just only

123
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,390
want you to do it this way.

124
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,720
But maybe find a way around it.

125
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:11,970
So if you Google like write writing for Huffington Post now if you find more detail info on how to make

126
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:13,930
contact the more traditional way.

127
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:18,600
There's even a core of post about this subject that we link to in the resources that outlines a few

128
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:23,820
ways to pitch and write for Huffington Post and includes responses and advice from longtime contributors.

129
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:29,510
Turns out it's not super hard so it is possible to write for bigger more mainstream sites.

130
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:34,410
It might require more digging and research but even if you're not ready you can book market a note.

131
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:36,940
All of these details for future reference.

132
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,910
Remember for the PR section reintroduced a concept called laddering up which is basically means that

133
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:46,770
while you can't really get into the New York Times without first getting into let's say Tech Crunch

134
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:52,210
you can't get into tech crunch until you've gotten into who know some smaller publication.

135
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,280
The same applies here.

136
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:59,280
You have to start small and easy and then use that example to ladder up to a progressively larger outlet.

137
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:04,740
People want to see proof that other people have published you that's a way that they save themselves

138
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:09,340
time are good so start working on your search for blogs that won't guest post.

139
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:14,010
Your list will get you started and help you get everything you need to actually contact them and pitch

140
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:14,640
your idea.

141
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:18,000
The last thing I'll say about it is that depending on the industry you're in.

142
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,440
There are some pre-made lists of blogs that guest post out there.

143
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,900
I will try to include some in the resources.

144
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:30,840
However they're usually specific to like technology or I don't know it's usually something really specific

145
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:34,140
so it might not match you but it's a good place to start.

146
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:34,500
All right guys.

147
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,850
More on that in the next lecture.

148
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:36,330
See the.
