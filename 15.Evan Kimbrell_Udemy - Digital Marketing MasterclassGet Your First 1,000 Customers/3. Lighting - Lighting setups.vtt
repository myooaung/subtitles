1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.050
So there are questions worth asking as well.

2
00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:05.280
What kind of lighting setup will you specifically need.

3
00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.660
More specifically how many lights will you need and what kind of special equipment will you'll need

4
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.670
to arrange and use red lights.

5
00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.480
Now obviously we need lights themselves and you'll need to choose the types.

6
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.990
The other thing to remember is that very often when you shoot in a room or office or some other place

7
00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.800
that has its own lights you probably have to shut off all the lights and use production lights instead.

8
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.840
So any lights in the ceiling lamps or desk lights or whatever else you shut all those often and turn

9
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.120
on your actual video lights on.

10
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.300
The other thing to keep in mind are lights as well.

11
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.410
What type of video are you trying to shoot.

12
00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:42.360
Thirty two a marketing video with one person sitting in front of a blank background looking at the camera

13
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.340
talking about stuff explaining things kind of you know like an explainer video.

14
00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.910
You'll need a way to set up that background and light it as well as lighting your speaker to make sure

15
00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.020
they look good.

16
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.150
Now on the other hand you might do a video with one person talking but they're talking to someone else

17
00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.040
off camera like in an interview.

18
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:04.080
So again they need to be lit nicely but instead of being in front of a blank background they'll probably

19
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.760
be sitting or standing somewhere in an office or some other location.

20
00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.090
Then of course you might do a video with two people talking to each other perhaps in an interview format

21
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.580
maybe like a conversation.

22
00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.720
Both people could be sitting in chairs or at a desk or in standing.

23
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.180
And they both need to be lit as well as you know any other objects or decoration of the scene.

24
00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.490
So with that in mind you still need to know what type of video you want to create the format you choose

25
00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.810
will pretty much dictate the listening equipment you're going to need.

26
00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.770
Obviously keep in mind if you're doing any shooting with one person while you only need a certain amount

27
00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.140
of light shooting with five people and you might need more lights.

28
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.630
Now here's how it generally works with lighting.

29
00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:50.370
And I'm going to condense into 30 45 seconds what some people study for over two years at film school.

30
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.620
When you're writing a subject you're generally supposed to have three different types of light.

31
00:01:54.660 --> 00:02:00.050
You have the key light the fill light and then essentially with like the backlight or the hair light.

32
00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.820
So this is the standard way that people film generally you're going to have a key light which is the

33
00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.910
main light that's going to fill 80 percent of your subject.

34
00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.920
And that's generally going to be of him staring at you right now.

35
00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:18.900
It's going to be 45 degrees away kind of this direction it should be hitting me like this and filling

36
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.770
my body to about this point.

37
00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.150
Then you have the fill light which will be exactly to my left.

38
00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.550
Right.

39
00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.310
So if I'm looking at a clock and B it's never good with clocks.

40
00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:33.140
Nine o'clock and that's going to fill the rest of my body.

41
00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.580
And then the third light which kind of optional.

42
00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:41.430
But this is again the standard the baseline ever uses is the hair light which is behind you hitting

43
00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.970
your head.

44
00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.770
What it does is it creates a nice outliner on your head and it creates separation between you and the

45
00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:47.430
background.

46
00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.200
Now if just one person you could shoot it like that if you're doing an interview.

47
00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.800
You could also shoot it like that.

48
00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:59.080
But here is my suggestion as someone who's been in the trenches doing this for way too long.

49
00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.640
Skip all that noise the key the fill in the hairline.

50
00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.780
It's completely unnecessary for marketing videos.

51
00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:12.870
We're making marketing videos means we don't need a lot of control over you know the drama TISM of the

52
00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.240
lighting on our face.

53
00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.860
We don't need to do a lot of crazy different things.

54
00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.280
So instead do what's called flatlining.

55
00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.990
Now is again.

56
00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.840
See this unamiable throw it up on the screen about how my lighting works.

57
00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.230
But it is literally flat.

58
00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:31.680
So I have one light over here and one light over here they're equal distance from each other equal distance

59
00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.940
from my face one way to me like this and one Lights me like this.

60
00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.850
It's flat out Avinza flat lighting as well.

61
00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.510
It gets really good coverage of your face but that's it.

62
00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.980
There's nothing special going on.

63
00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:51.300
It's entire focus is on lengthening you up as much as possible which in a marketing video is what we

64
00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.770
want.

65
00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.430
We want a clean look.

66
00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:59.220
We want we don't want them to be distracted by shadows on your face or any type of stylistic kind of

67
00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.770
lighting.

68
00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:05.790
If you are commercials you'll notice that they're very rarely lit with anything other than flat lining.

69
00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:10.220
They're just lit up like you just took that person and turned up the brightness on them so seriously

70
00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:15.360
don't get in the weeds about all the different angles you can use with lighting it is way overwhelming

71
00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.600
if you're just trying to do a simple shot from marketing.

72
00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:19.790
Just use flatlining.

73
00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.240
Any idiot can set it up.

74
00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:24.690
Nobody's shooting with multiple people and you need to light them both at the same time.

75
00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:30.030
If there's two people you kind of do the same thing or it's a set of lights for one person a set of

76
00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.860
lights for another you're kind of on a budget.

77
00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:38.700
Well you can do flat again you can do flat where say two people are sitting right next to each other

78
00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:43.520
and like a talk show kind of format and then you'll just have one on this direction on the other.

79
00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:47.550
Only difference there as you might want a larger one that gives off more light to cover both of them

80
00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:48.270
equally.

81
00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:53.610
The other thing you might see in marketing videos is called background lighting.

82
00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:58.830
Now I don't actually use background running in this shop but in some other ones you can definitely see

83
00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:03.270
it that generally does it just brightens up whatever is behind you.

84
00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:08.890
Beggaring learning just helps to make the scene brighter because it's really hard to brighten up scenes

85
00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.660
when you're editing it after you've filmed it.

86
00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:18.610
It's way way better just to do it with lights brighter scenes are happier scenes they're less distracting

87
00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.850
and that's why they're so popular with marketing videos.

88
00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.120
Now how exactly do you position lights.

89
00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:23.710
Well.

90
00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:24.370
Pretty simple.

91
00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:26.190
You just have things called light stands.

92
00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:29.740
Right and they can go anywhere from eight dollars to God.

93
00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:35.200
There's things called century stands which are kind of an industry standard in large productions which

94
00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:38.140
cost them like 200 dollars each.

95
00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:42.880
If you're shooting with Ltd's you can get away with really cheap small light stands.

96
00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.120
And if you're using small lights you can get away with the cheapo ones.

97
00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:50.350
My general sweet spot is just to shoot for kind of the middle of the road.

98
00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:55.990
Don't spend $200 on a light stand don't spend nine try to get the ones like $30 because they'll actually

99
00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:56.570
last.

100
00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:59.850
But they're also hold up larger lights now perhaps light stands.

101
00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:07.840
Well you might use clamps and clamps can help you if you need to put lights on like a doorway or above

102
00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:13.680
someone in a very specific setting where let's say it's not a perfectly controlled environment.

103
00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:20.140
You're filming in a separate scene separate location and you can just fit all the lights or something

104
00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:20.810
like that.

105
00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:27.040
Ultimately whatever position you use with your lighting or it's flat or it's the traditional key fill

106
00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:34.150
hair light or if you have lots of lights lots of background lights hair lights accessory lights all

107
00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:38.840
these different things you can spend absolutely days researching this stuff.

108
00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:43.880
One of the things that really is going to matter is a concept in lighting.

109
00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:48.100
Now before I talked about how we have sharp shadows and soft shadows while what creates sharp shadows

110
00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:49.200
and what creates soft shadows.

111
00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:56.020
Well it has to do with the light source now larger light sources generally make softer shadows smaller

112
00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:58.930
for whatever reason make harsher shadows.

113
00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:05.380
So oftentimes what you'll find is that people try to soften up the light by making it larger.

114
00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:07.620
That's why we have things called soft boxes.

115
00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:09.310
It was again a soft box.

116
00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:10.730
They look pretty ridiculous.

117
00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:17.200
There are these things you stick on front of your lights that expand the range of the light so it makes

118
00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:20.920
the light source larger you ever bored want to see what I mean.

119
00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:24.310
Take your iPhone and use the light and then play it on yourself.

120
00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:29.120
It's such a small light source no matter where you shine it always has to be in the dark.

121
00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:35.590
You'll notice that it's it's going to be very harsh the lines are to go black to lit.

122
00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:37.470
And you won't even notice the transition.

123
00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:39.660
So you know don't be surprised when you see soft boxes.

124
00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:46.720
And in general I think soft boxes are a great way to use cheaper lights but then improve the quality

125
00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:53.110
by adding a $30 softball so that kind of funny if you see photographers sometimes they'll use octo boxes

126
00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:58.750
which are soft boxes that are shaped like an octagon and they'll have them almost comically large I've

127
00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:04.420
seen soft boxes that are 15 feet tall because again larger lightsource softer light.

128
00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:04.870
Right.

129
00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:07.410
It is true and that's how their photos gets.

130
00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:09.850
Oh incredibly high quality.

131
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.160
But there is obviously a limit right.

132
00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:14.380
So let's start a little bit about accessory lights.

133
00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:14.590
Right.

134
00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:19.690
So the main lights we have are going to you know we're going to pick our daylight's or our tongue stands

135
00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:21.430
or we'll go with Ltds.

136
00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:26.200
Chains are only going to pick two lights because we can just use flat lining because that's the Evans

137
00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:27.290
special.

138
00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:29.430
Let's talk a little bit of accessory lights.

139
00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:33.490
So there's another type of light you might consider using and this is really popular on YouTube and

140
00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:34.930
it's called a ring light.

141
00:08:34.930 --> 00:08:39.640
Now this is a circular shaped light where you put a camera in the middle of it and you have your speaker

142
00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:41.770
face the camera when you turn the light on.

143
00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:48.760
Essentially what it does is it black light onto the speaker's face which eliminates any pockets or shadows

144
00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:53.040
on their face so it can create a really clear picture.

145
00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:57.340
The cons of using something like this though is that if you're staring at a camera and there's a light

146
00:08:57.340 --> 00:09:01.510
around it it's kind of like staring directly into the sun.

147
00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:05.660
It's unbelievably taxing on your eyes doing the thing.

148
00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:12.070
I consider it a con but some people think of it as a pro it is kind of weird is it creates a weird effect

149
00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:17.620
in your pupils So if you're filming too close to someone you see this on the with the video as you can

150
00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:19.800
see a ring inside of their eyes.

151
00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:23.280
Now a lot of YouTube YouTube's actually do this because they think it's cool.

152
00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:30.940
So next time you watch any youtube or like like make up YouTube is staring really close to the screen.

153
00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:34.300
And look at their pupils you'll usually see a ring around it.

154
00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:39.320
Those usually will come in early diversions but there's also florescence that just they're just two

155
00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:43.360
blades of the accessory like would be just using a backlight.

156
00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:50.330
Right so a lot of times you can use really small lights to put them behind you to hit your back.

157
00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:53.950
And what that does is it creates separation between you and the background.

158
00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:58.260
Now personally I know I haven't noticed a huge difference with these.

159
00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:01.480
Maybe I just I'm not using it correctly or whatever reason.

160
00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:03.950
I've seen people compared the before and the after.

161
00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:07.220
I honestly just don't think it's worth the effort.

162
00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:10.480
If you're going all out on production Why not.

163
00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:14.100
It really does make your body kind of pop out of the image.

164
00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:19.690
However if you're not sure you're some budget conscious I think it's something to skip that sort of

165
00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:23.950
light you might run into is for background learning or talking before UV light the background makes

166
00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:29.350
it brighter brighter is generally better for marketing for clarity for being less distracting and makes

167
00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:32.020
it a lot easier after you shoot for editing.

168
00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:37.690
In that case you'll generally have are what are called pronounced for the longest time Fresno lights

169
00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:40.420
but I believe I actually pronounce for Nell.

170
00:10:40.570 --> 00:10:47.410
So for now lights are kind of like floodlights in the sense that there are lights with a small light

171
00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:48.160
source.

172
00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:53.140
And what they do is they hit a lens and it's of color for now lens and that lens basically shoots the

173
00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:55.320
light in all different directions.

174
00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:57.880
So it ends up happening is you have this like that.

175
00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:03.490
It's kind of like a spotlight but in your video production so what you can do is you can just aim it

176
00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:08.590
directly at the background sometimes you can put it behind the person and hit it on the background.

177
00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:12.880
And that's a cheap easy way of just lining up a large area.

178
00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:19.330
He had to do that with normal lights while I mean you have to have more lights and they're more expensive.

179
00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:21.700
Any other things you might think about with regards to lighting.

180
00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:23.290
Well you might think of a background.

181
00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:28.170
And it's not really related to lighting but it's simply something to consider.

182
00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:32.530
I don't know if you guys have watched any of the wisteria videos on their website but they've kind of

183
00:11:32.530 --> 00:11:37.080
mastered that like talking head explainer video with the background format.

184
00:11:37.090 --> 00:11:43.960
So you know if you watch any of those and all it's all the same format and you'll see in the back there's

185
00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:45.500
kind of a gradient light.

186
00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:51.670
So the top of the frame will be like whatever the color the background is and then it gets lighter and

187
00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:53.530
you get closer to their head.

188
00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:58.100
We actually cover this more in detail later in the section so you'll see what I mean.

189
00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:02.350
It's actually something that a lot of YouTube instructors have copied for that look.

190
00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:03.900
It's actually pretty easy.

191
00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:06.360
You just buy what's called seamless paper.

192
00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:11.830
Well that basically means is that it's paper that has no seams on it it's just one long roll of the

193
00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:18.610
big paper and usually you just tack that behind yourself and that's a great way of getting what color

194
00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:20.740
whatever color you want on the wall.

195
00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:24.460
That's a great way of not distracting the person watching the camera.

196
00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:29.680
Focus on the talent or the person speaking at the camera and in general.

197
00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:30.890
It's a very clean look.

198
00:12:30.890 --> 00:12:34.410
Or is that kind of wraps up our crash course on lighting.

199
00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:37.610
Is there more I could say oh my god yes there is.

200
00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:44.560
I could you could go on for hours and hours hours their entire 40 hour course is dedicated just to lighting.

201
00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:46.150
This is the crash course right.

202
00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:49.240
All you need to understand is that we have different color temperatures.

203
00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:51.180
Does it matter color temperature you use.

204
00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:52.630
Just don't mix them.

205
00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:57.730
You have you and you have tungsten Thomsons come from incandescent bulbs.

206
00:12:57.730 --> 00:13:00.720
They're kind of yellowish orange warmer.

207
00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:01.700
Easier on the eyes.

208
00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:06.650
Cheaper but they will cook your room and it gets kind of uncomfortable for long periods of time.

209
00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:12.160
Daylight bulbs in their hand are bright white things you see in like hospitals or warehouses things

210
00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:14.710
where you need to have a lot of visual clarity.

211
00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:18.730
Daylight's are not as hot and they're not as cheap.

212
00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:23.000
Daylight's typically come from fluorescent bulbs or in some cases it doesn't matter.

213
00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.060
It's called CFL.

214
00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:28.920
That they're overloading or Ali Deis Ltds or super portable super convenient.

215
00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:30.460
They can be battery powered.

216
00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:32.770
They're really small.

217
00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:39.220
However they're extremely expensive and the cheap ones are worse than just using your own light bulbs

218
00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:40.000
in the ceiling.

219
00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.100
Past that point if you want to look like you were to film school and use what's called three point lighting

220
00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:45.960
three point lighting is when you put one.

221
00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:51.640
It's called the key light which is generally 45 degrees if you're looking forward it's 45 degrees to

222
00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:57.790
your right or left and then use a fill light which is always going to be 90 degrees in the opposite

223
00:13:57.790 --> 00:13:58.350
direction.

224
00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:04.660
And then use a hair or a light or a backlight usually on the ground pointing up or up in the air pointing

225
00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:06.720
down on the back of your subject.

226
00:14:06.730 --> 00:14:11.890
Now I think that's a bunch of B.S. just use flat lighting which is we're used to lights and you put

227
00:14:11.890 --> 00:14:15.810
them equal distance away from you and equal distance from themselves.

228
00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:19.480
So if you're the tip of a triangle This is the base.

229
00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:23.170
This is what I use and this is what really really works for marketing videos.

230
00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:27.570
It's simple and it illuminates you really cleanly pass it.

231
00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:32.470
There's a lot of accessories you can go for but they're not entirely necessary.

232
00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:37.840
You can use those headlights you can use ring lights which are just go over your lens and focus on your

233
00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:40.340
face and you can use background lighting.

234
00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:46.270
Usually things like for Nelle lights are the most cost effective or just general what's being used for

235
00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:50.980
now lights can come in tungsten or daylight or Ltd's even.

236
00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:56.020
Ok now that is the basic essentials you need to know if you were to go out and put together some video

237
00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:57.940
equipment and try to shoot your own videos.

238
00:14:57.970 --> 00:15:04.930
Hopefully that's enough you guys started if you have any questions always just post in the slack and

239
00:15:04.930 --> 00:15:10.240
optionally If that doesn't work post in the Q&amp;A although it takes longer to see those questions and

240
00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:14.100
then I can just help you out because there's an immense amount of detail to this.

241
00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:18.550
The last thing I'll say is you might think to yourself hey this lighting thing is a lot of work a lot

242
00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:19.660
of effort too expensive.

243
00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:20.790
I don't want to do it.

244
00:15:20.950 --> 00:15:24.220
A lot of people might think hey I can just fix this after I film it.

245
00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:25.480
Kind of like Instagram right.

246
00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:28.330
Take a crappy photo and then use a filter to make it look better.

247
00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:31.150
One thing I can tell you right now is don't do that.

248
00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:35.830
It's really really hard to fix things after the fact and even if you do fix them after the fact I'll

249
00:15:35.830 --> 00:15:37.270
never look as good.

250
00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:39.200
And you know this is something we say etches.

251
00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:47.380
What's the best way of fixing something it's to reshoot not anything else redo it the correct way you

252
00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:51.620
can fix something as an editing but that should be your absolute last resort.

253
00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:54.490
Please please please do not fall into that trap.

254
00:15:54.490 --> 00:15:56.410
All right guys I will see you in the next lecture.
