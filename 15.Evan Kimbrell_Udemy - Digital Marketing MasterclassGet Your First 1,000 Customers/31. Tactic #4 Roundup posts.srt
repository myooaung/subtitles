00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,280
Hey guys welcome back to the course.

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:08,740
Now with these last few lectures on how to write controversial post topical posts in long form content.

3
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:14,220
I don't know if you noticed but those are types of content that are a step up from your basic blog post

4
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:15,210
or tweet.

5
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:19,920
If you were to start creating long form content for example you're showing that you're ready to dedicate

6
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:23,510
a more significant amount of time to the content that you're creating.

7
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:28,680
The nice part is that you can then expect bigger results because of that extra effort.

8
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:34,590
I only point this out because the type of content I want to tell you about in this lecture also requires

9
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:40,950
an extra amount of attention but like those other three types of content it can pay off in a big way.

10
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:46,600
So you have to kind of justify it to yourself up front so just keep watching promises is a good one.

11
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:50,000
In this lecture I want to tell you about how to create round up posts.

12
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:54,300
Now we mentioned roundups earlier in the section as one of the 10 different common types of content

13
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:59,750
people use need a reminder round ups are where you ask a group of experts one question.

14
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:03,040
Collect their answers and you share them all in one big post.

15
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:07,230
Salvias he got some good benefits to the experts come up with all the great content for you.

16
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:11,850
It's a great way to get links and shares because those experts usually share the posts themselves and

17
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:14,190
it can lead to lots of new followers and engagement.

18
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:18,110
Because you've got all of the experts followers checking out your post as well.

19
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:22,560
Basically by creating a successful round up post you can introduce yourself to a bunch of experts and

20
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,520
their followers and a signal to them that your blog could be a source of information they'd want to

21
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,530
check out in the future.

22
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:30,240
So how can you create one of these round up posts.

23
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,540
Well it all starts with a question.

24
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,830
What would you ask an expert in your industry.

25
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:38,160
That would be of interest to your audience and to be honest that's the question you ask yourself in

26
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:41,480
order to come up with the question you'd ask experts.

27
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:43,170
I know if that really makes sense.

28
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:44,150
There's a lot of questions.

29
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,680
So what is that question going to be.

30
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:49,940
What's something that you would find interesting and your audience would find interesting as well.

31
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:52,850
Well let's go over for common types of question.

32
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,260
You could use for a round up post.

33
00:01:55,260 --> 00:02:01,290
First of all you could ask experts a yes or no question but only if you also asked for an explanation

34
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,490
afterwards.

35
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:05,610
Basically you're asking for them to take sides on an issue.

36
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:10,290
So you want to know why they would or would not support a given scenario or option.

37
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:15,950
For example you could ask a group of tech experts if you are in charge would you redesign the iPhone.

38
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:21,270
Why and how would you part of the question is clearly looking for a yes or no answer.

39
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:23,850
But the second part of the question demands more detail.

40
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:28,840
A simple yes or no provides no value by itself to the reader.

41
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:32,920
The explanation that comes afterwards will provide actual Great insight.

42
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:36,530
Now the same goes for any multiple choice type question you ask.

43
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,850
You can get your experts a list of options to choose from.

44
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:44,880
You know like Option A B C or D and then ask for an explanation and if necessary give them the option

45
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,230
of choosing a different answer.

46
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:51,450
For example you might ask a group of app developers which platform should a new app developers start

47
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:55,230
developing for their brand new iOS Android or both.

48
00:02:55,270 --> 00:03:00,100
You didn't ask for reasons but of course you leave the door open in case there's some other options.

49
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:04,800
Like I don't know Windows Phone is going to make a comeback so maybe they'll say Windows Phone.

50
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:10,020
Probably not a lot of times round up post authors will instead just go with an open ended question.

51
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:16,350
Now this is a question that has no yes or no answer but instead it leaves the answer completely up to

52
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:18,190
how the expert wants to respond.

53
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:22,830
For example you might ask diet experts if someone's trying to lose weight.

54
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:26,210
What's the most important change they should make in their lives now.

55
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:32,040
The answers could range anywhere from like cutting out specific foods to lifestyle changes like waking

56
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,870
up early or exercising.

57
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:37,770
It could be really anything but it could not be a yes or no.

58
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:42,630
You might ask a group of writers what tool or platform do you use to write your books.

59
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:47,730
You might hear about 10 different apps but some of them might also say get a pencil and paper and start

60
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:48,300
writing.

61
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,120
Who knows.

62
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:53,380
That's kind of the nice part about open ended questions you're not restricting the experts in any way.

63
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,070
But there's another question type that's kind of interesting.

64
00:03:56,070 --> 00:04:01,230
Now that's the fill in the blank which is basically a question but it's disguised as a statement of

65
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:02,170
some kind.

66
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:06,290
For example you could ask project managers to complete the sentence.

67
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:10,760
The thing that keeps my team's projects on schedule more than anything else is blank.

68
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:15,720
Maybe it's an app or maybe it's a way of doing things or maybe it's a person that just is really good

69
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,450
at keeping projects going let them surprise you.

70
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:22,480
The more novel The format generally the more interesting the article be.

71
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:28,420
In all four cases yes knows multiple choices and open ended questions and fill in the blanks.

72
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:33,530
The response you get from your expert is far more valuable within an explanation in tow.

73
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:36,900
Why did you choose that answer over another answer.

74
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:42,180
After all the reason you're asking experts these questions is because of their experience and the reasoning

75
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,230
behind their answers.

76
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:46,850
What will make your post really insightful and help people actually learn.

77
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,930
So let's say you came up with a great question.

78
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:51,480
You wish you could ask all the experts in your industry.

79
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:55,790
Well now you just need to follow these steps for creating your Round-Up.

80
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,520
First you make a list of experts on how to contact them.

81
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:05,880
You prepare how you'll collect their responses create a template message or email asking your question.

82
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:11,170
After that you can contact the experts and in the end collect your responses put them together into

83
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:14,010
a post and then let them know that you've published it.

84
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,640
It's really not that hard.

85
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:20,170
The only hard part and there is maybe finding their email address but we've covered that several times

86
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:22,660
in the course already where we talk or e-mail hunting.

87
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:27,130
There are some details in each step that you could know about that will still make it all a little bit

88
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:27,730
easier.

89
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:33,760
So first Once you have the question you've settled on a question that you want to ask you need to identify

90
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:38,520
your group of X parents but also make note of the best way to get in contact with them.

91
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:43,390
Making a list of experts means going out to industry blogs and finding people who write about these

92
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:49,150
topics regularly what you're hoping for experts with an actual following on their blog and on social

93
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:49,810
media.

94
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:54,340
Part of the reason you're doing this is to open your blog up to a bigger audience.

95
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:59,020
So make sure at least some of the experts you're asking have their own audience themselves.

96
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:03,490
It's OK to choose some experts without a big following as long as you know they'll be able to provide

97
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:09,130
some valuable information as part of your research on these experts and you figure out how to contact

98
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:09,690
them.

99
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,550
Do you have e-mails for them or Twitter handles.

100
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:17,320
Ideally it would be easiest for you if you could send your message to everyone the same way like sending

101
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:23,170
them on e-mail but there might be a few experts who just can't find e-mails for or maybe they are on

102
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:23,860
Twitter.

103
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:27,320
You might be stuck submitting a contact form on their blog.

104
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:28,610
What are the method is.

105
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:30,760
Figure out how to contact them.

106
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,530
So you know what to do when you actually go to send your message.

107
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:39,460
The next step is to figure out how you'll be collecting responses to your round up question.

108
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:43,410
Yes you could just send an e-mail and ask experts to answer right there in the message.

109
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:45,890
But let's consider some alternatives first.

110
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:50,270
You could create your own google form which is really easy to do and then share it.

111
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:54,100
You could also use an online survey tool like Survey Monkey.

112
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:58,570
Asiri has been around for years and they do have a free plan that easily colonnades what you need to

113
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:03,760
do for a round approach which is not much the advantage of using an online form or surveys of all the

114
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:06,310
responses is get stored for you in one place.

115
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:09,380
It's a little bit easier than sifting through your inbox looking for answers.

116
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:14,710
Since Google form and Survey Monkey are both free options give them a look and consider using one of

117
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:15,250
those.

118
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:18,090
It also makes you look more prepared when you reach out to them.

119
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:23,020
If you go with one of these offerings then create the form or survey now because you'll need the link

120
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:28,330
for whatever message you send ask your question and put in the proper response fields you need.

121
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:30,260
Make sure to include a confirmation page.

122
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:34,600
But thanks them for their time and a way to get back in touch with you if they want.

123
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,250
Perhaps Actually they'll ask when the post is up.

124
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:41,670
Or they might want to know more though or maybe they'll ask you to participate in their own round up.

125
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,620
So that brings us to the next step here.

126
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:48,810
Do yourself a favor and come up with a message template that includes the body of your message including

127
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:54,250
a request to answer your specific question and if necessary links to anything that's relevant such as

128
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:58,510
like the Google form or survey we're going to collect the responses when sending your message.

129
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:01,280
You of course want to be polite and professional.

130
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:06,640
You know these experts aren't obligated to do anything so if you're rude or demanding it's easy enough

131
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,470
to delete your email and just ignore you.

132
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:11,620
So try to follow a couple simple rules.

133
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,690
Try to greet them in a warm way.

134
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:16,120
Don't just put their name and then a hyphen.

135
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:22,150
Try to say Dear Steve or Dear Mr Jobs and please don't try to email Steve Jobs he's obviously not going

136
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:22,830
to answer.

137
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:26,920
The next thing is that you just need to get to the point and assume that your expert has basically zero

138
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,900
time for you.

139
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:30,820
So make your request quick and relevant.

140
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:34,830
I follow your blog and I really enjoy your post about whatever the topic is.

141
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,330
It's a mobile technology or app development.

142
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:40,780
I'm running a post about this topic I was hoping you'd answer this question.

143
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:45,550
I'd love to include your response to my blog and we'll add a link to your blog in my post and then you

144
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:50,560
might even put relevant things like how much traffic you have and then ask your question and be clear

145
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,150
about what you want from them.

146
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:54,200
That multiple choice is open ended.

147
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:58,050
Whatever it is tell them exactly what they need to do and when.

148
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:02,700
Again experts have no time for your foolish games so make this stupid easy.

149
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:05,180
Please email or reply with your answer by Friday.

150
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:11,110
My first so I concluded in my post or please answer the question on my google form by Friday March first

151
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:12,480
and then include the link.

152
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:17,110
Make sure you leave yourself enough time obviously in case you want to publish this by a certain date.

153
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:21,640
A few extra days obviously is usually good enough to get the responses from any late responders.

154
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:25,690
With that being said it's a good chance that some of the experts just simply don't respond.

155
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:30,750
So if you plan on getting 5 experts email 10 then the last thing is just thank them again.

156
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:33,040
Again be polite and thank them for their time.

157
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,290
Chances are you're going to use them in the future.

158
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:38,980
This is a great way to open up doors for networking and Co promotion.

159
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:43,590
If they want more info than they'll reply or get in touch somehow on the survey itself.

160
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:47,980
Make sure that you are very crystal clear about what's going on.

161
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:53,800
Write some introduction tasks explaining again what the relevant information is.

162
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:57,970
Make sure you have clear instructions so that they know what to do when they click through.

163
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:02,350
Now here's another important thing to keep in find if you can't find an email for the expert you want.

164
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:08,340
You can actually share a link to your survey instead in a tweet just at mention them and ask them politely

165
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:10,360
if they'd answer a question about your topic.

166
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:15,600
But obviously since you can include every detail in 140 characters on Twitter make sure the page where

167
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,670
they give a response has those details already and then obviously be careful that other people aren't

168
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:23,010
filling it out and you might get confused.

169
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:25,770
So when you have your message in your survey form ready to roll.

170
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:26,940
Contact your experts.

171
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:28,820
Send your e-mails or your tweets.

172
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,230
Once the responses start arriving you can begin work on your post.

173
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:37,230
The tool like Google form or Survey Monkey you can basically go to a dashboard type page and see what's

174
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:37,890
arrived.

175
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:42,810
Take the responses them again drafting up your purse if necessary reach out to any experts who are late

176
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:46,130
and remind them or even if your deadline has come and gone.

177
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:50,670
If you have the time you can reach out again and say there's still time to be included or I don't know

178
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:52,510
some kind of job to get them motivated.

179
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:57,150
When everything is all set and your post is good to go publish that thing and then reach out to your

180
00:10:57,150 --> 00:11:01,860
experts tweet out a link to your person and make sure to at mention the people that are in it.

181
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:05,480
You're bound to get obviously likes and read tweets along with some new followers.

182
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:08,070
You can also just e-mail experts personally and thank them.

183
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:12,030
Don't skip this step especially if he hope to do more round ups in the future.

184
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:14,430
This is a great time to start a relationship with them.

185
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:15,520
So there you have it.

186
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:20,880
All the steps for creating a round up post before I sign off I want to mention one alternative because

187
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,970
there are actually two ways you can create a round up post.

188
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:26,330
Here's the way I mentioned which is basically read out.

189
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:29,700
Reach out to experts personally either through email or social media.

190
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,090
Ask them your questions collect their answers and then publish your findings.

191
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,590
But the other way of doing this.

192
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:39,870
Another way of creating a round up post is instead you curate answers from online public sources.

193
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:44,730
This case you don't actually ask anyone questions what you're doing is just finding answers to a question

194
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:47,050
you would ask if you could.

195
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:48,340
Now how is this a good idea.

196
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:54,510
I hope for example and you can ask obviously ask Steve Jobs or Alfred Hitchcock or Meyer Angelo your

197
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:56,670
really cool question about creativity.

198
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:01,380
Sadly they're gone through quotes and other resources online you could probably find a relevant quote

199
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:02,340
from them.

200
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:06,000
It's also a great way to tie this up with something topical or timely.

201
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,440
Can they help you promote your post.

202
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,430
Obviously not.

203
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:11,090
Can they give you a custom response to your question due again.

204
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:14,580
Is this an ideal way to do your round up and just kind of depends.

205
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:16,430
It depends on how much work you put into it.

206
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:23,820
How you can even mix it up by taking past experts and comparing their quotes to real life experts and

207
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,290
then showing the difference.

208
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:28,890
It would be interesting to see other responses from today's experts match up with those experts who

209
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:30,560
are around anymore right.

210
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:32,000
I know that some of the things about.

211
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:33,390
OK so that's it for round ups.

212
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:34,350
I'll see you in the next lecture.
