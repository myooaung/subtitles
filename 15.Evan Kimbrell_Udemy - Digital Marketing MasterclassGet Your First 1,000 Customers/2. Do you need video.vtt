00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:01.650
Hey guys welcome back.

2
00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:03.840
So we're learning about video marketing right.

3
00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.480
That's what the section is all about.

4
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.200
Well here's an important question.

5
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.670
You need to ask yourself before you even watch the rest of the lectures.

6
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:15.170
We have like 20 lectures or so and it's going to take a certain amount of your time.

7
00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.370
I think this is a question that you should address way before you even first try to make your first

8
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:20.970
video.

9
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:27.930
Now of course it is part of your content strategy and York on marketing efforts in general.

10
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.760
Do you need video.

11
00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:31.230
Yes actually that is the question.

12
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.180
Do you need a video keyword being need.

13
00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.880
Now I honestly couldn't care less if you're watching this video and you say I don't need video for my

14
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.620
business because that's actually pretty common.

15
00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.840
Not everyone watching is going to find video worthwhile.

16
00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:47.820
You can try it.

17
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.520
You can try to force it and to really shoehorn it into your larger marketing strategy to get your 500

18
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.450
customers.

19
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.940
But for some businesses it just doesn't make sense.

20
00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.650
Also video is a lot of work.

21
00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:02.340
What's the way of work.

22
00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.110
It's one thing to write a blog post that you can easily get someone on the other side of the world to

23
00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:07.980
do.

24
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:14.340
But coming up with a video idea planning it shooting it actually editing it putting it together and

25
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.680
then promoting it.

26
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.680
That's quite a bit of that a lot of effort you don't have to figure out a lot of new software you're

27
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.000
going to figure out how video equipment works.

28
00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:27.030
You have to learn things like the difference between scripting for talking into a video and scripting

29
00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.220
for a blog video just takes a lot more time than other types of content you create.

30
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.630
I mean if you write well for instance you could probably rock out a whole bunch of blog posts in the

31
00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.630
time it takes to create one video.

32
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.180
But of course there are many reasons why people go through this extra effort to create videos and that's

33
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.100
because video is the most visually engaging format you will find kind of touch this.

34
00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:49.320
The Last Lecture.

35
00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:50.990
No that's no exaggeration.

36
00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:57.230
Well you know except for maybe like for video you know those movie theaters you put on the glasses and

37
00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.260
you know they like pulp and the smells and everything feels like it's coming at you.

38
00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.560
And of course there's also virtual reality and augmented reality.

39
00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.840
But besides those it's the most engaging.

40
00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.880
Anyway the video if you ask someone if they'd rather read something or watch something well I bet more

41
00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.700
people would say video.

42
00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:14.370
I don't know.

43
00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.790
I mean you might get mixed results because there's always seems some sticklers out there that would

44
00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.920
rather read things to me highly dependent on demographics and what topic it is.

45
00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.230
But without asking if you started up a video in front of all of those same people I bet Otterson of

46
00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.240
them would at least watch the first section of it doesn't matter if the written version is right in

47
00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.000
front of them.

48
00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.150
Human nature will force everyone's attention to go to the screen with the video and sound is playing.

49
00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:44.400
Now that proven ability to capture people's attention is why so many marketers are jumping on the video

50
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.750
bandwagon or at least trying.

51
00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.550
And while the data really does support it.

52
00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:56.160
The video gets crazy results that prior to video you probably could never have imagined the video to

53
00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.580
a page.

54
00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.470
For instance this is what the data says.

55
00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.690
It is 53 times more likely to be on the first Rozel on a kugel search.

56
00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:04.840
I'm not even mad.

57
00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:06.390
It's amazing.

58
00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.240
Yes fifty three times more likely.

59
00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.470
So if getting a page found on your Web site is important.

60
00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.710
Video could be a pretty big catalyst.

61
00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:16.550
Here is another stat that blows my mind.

62
00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:23.010
The video to a page it also increases the conversions just generically speaking by 70 to 80 percent.

63
00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.810
Now Kernighan is always the come in all different flavors like registration inquiries downloads and

64
00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.030
obviously sales.

65
00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.150
My favorite types of video marketing are product videos and they can be especially powerful when you're

66
00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.300
trying to sell a product on a page.

67
00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:43.110
I just see a blank piece of text telling me how great this TV is or whatever it is I'm looking to buy

68
00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:47.050
or I see a video of someone using it and then talking about it.

69
00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.080
Chances are the video is more convincing.

70
00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.100
So those are just a few key benefits of video.

71
00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.740
But when it comes down to actually diving in and creating video projects you still need to know if it's

72
00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:00.930
feasible specifically for you and your project regardless of what industry data might say about the

73
00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:01.830
benefits.

74
00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.820
Is video going to work for you.

75
00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.860
So when you ask yourself we need video or not.

76
00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:10.510
The way you answer this is by answering some other questions first.

77
00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:15.730
Now number one would it be easier for your audience to read your content rather than watch it in a video.

78
00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.280
Now this isn't an all or nothing question.

79
00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:22.260
You're not going to do all video but you might do all text and pictures.

80
00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:23.570
Plenty of people do.

81
00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:28.920
However there might be certain kinds of posts that if made into a video would do a better job of telling

82
00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.860
the story or describing a process.

83
00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:37.300
So would video be easier in those cases if you have a blog and your style is to write short stories.

84
00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:38.460
Probably not.

85
00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:43.590
Video is not going to work there but if you're doing case studies on a client well then video can help

86
00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.650
because you can have them talk into a camera and then tell the story.

87
00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.930
The second thing you need to ask yourself is can you afford the cost of producing videos now.

88
00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:51.530
Sure.

89
00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.220
Many people make their money back.

90
00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.950
In fact the status something like 76 percent of businesses invest in video recoup their costs.

91
00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:03.240
But there's still a costs regardless of if you're buying software running equipment or even hiring freelance

92
00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.990
crews help you produce a video.

93
00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:08.700
Some of you out there can't afford these expenses and that is fine.

94
00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:10.330
You need to be honest with yourself about it.

95
00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:15.120
You could produce your own videos on the cheap using a laptop webcam or your iPhone but obviously the

96
00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:20.240
quality there is going to be lower than a video made with all the right equipment that's perfectly fine

97
00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:27.780
but low quality video only works in certain circumstances and it kind of excludes you from making video

98
00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:31.420
as a branding statement about your business or your company or even your product.

99
00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:33.120
And that brings me to my next question.

100
00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:39.450
Number three is can you deliver the value you want by using video now as engaging as video is is a visual

101
00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:39.930
format.

102
00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:44.040
It still takes talent to know how to create a video how to shoot things the right way how to make your

103
00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:46.260
videos look good in the lectures I've had.

104
00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:47.930
I'm going to go over all of these things.

105
00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:53.370
If you're short on video knowledge you won't be for long but video might not be the medium that you

106
00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:54.540
necessarily get.

107
00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:56.610
Words might be way easier.

108
00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:58.680
And that's also perfectly fine.

109
00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.580
You need to obviously rely on your strengths whatever they are.

110
00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:06.120
That's how we go over so many different traction channels not only need to figure out the traction channel

111
00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:09.330
works for your company but you need to figure out if you're good at it.

112
00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:13.530
In this case if you can't afford the right equipment and talent well then you'd be stuck trying to figure

113
00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:15.140
out video production on your own.

114
00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:18.210
And then again it just depends how much time you have to spend on it.

115
00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:22.800
Now the fourth question I think is worth asking is do you have the time to produce the types of videos

116
00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:27.210
you want now videos in general are going to take longer to produce than Blog Post and other written

117
00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:27.860
content.

118
00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:34.680
So do you have the time to devote to it to plan to organize a script to shoot and then edit it.

119
00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:40.110
Now obviously some types of video are a lot easier if making a screencast of your product that's generally

120
00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:45.030
easier but it's still going to take more time than just writing up a guide on how to do it.

121
00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:49.060
And the last question I think that's worth asking is who is my audience.

122
00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:49.570
OK.

123
00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:52.710
Older audiences don't like video.

124
00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:53.900
You have to keep this in mind.

125
00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:56.820
Younger audiences are more open to it.

126
00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:00.770
Does your audience actually use video to consume a lot of their information.

127
00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:06.540
If you're making software and you sell the like scientific research teams do you really think they're

128
00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:12.300
sitting around watching videos to figure out what equipment or what software they need to buy to run

129
00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:13.230
their study.

130
00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:15.920
No they're probably going to be reading articles.

131
00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:17.520
So that's the last thing you really need to keep in mind.

132
00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:23.460
Where does your audience hang out if they're not on YouTube if they're not checking out Facebook videos

133
00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:28.020
or in general they're just not video crazy and it's not the first thing they would do and they need

134
00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:29.120
to answer a question.

135
00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:31.120
Well then it's maybe videos not for you.

136
00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:35.530
So really what I asked is this is video the right fit for you and your audience.

137
00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:40.960
And can you afford the time and cost it might take to produce said videos.

138
00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:44.200
Now you might be listening these questions and thinking yes you know you're right.

139
00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:45.380
Videos not for me.

140
00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:49.320
But again I'm just sharing the questions you need to ask before you jump in.

141
00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:53.790
I think for a lot of people deciding whether or not to do video comes down to the technical skills and

142
00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:58.110
the money if you're clueless about which end of the iPhone has the camera lens.

143
00:07:58.260 --> 00:07:59.000
Here's a hint.

144
00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:00.120
It's both.

145
00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:00.920
I mean it's OK.

146
00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:02.370
You don't have to do video.

147
00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:03.360
Keep on writing.

148
00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:08.940
And if money is a legitimate cause for concern to well then make sure that you know you have limited

149
00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:09.990
options going into it.

150
00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:11.170
But I will say this.

151
00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:16.860
We're going to talk about in this section how you create video on different budgets and you'd be amazed

152
00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:19.310
at what you can do with a very small budget.

153
00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:22.220
So if you think videos for you proceed if you're not sure.

154
00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:27.460
Proceed with caution and if you're pretty sure that he is not your thing well you're not going to hurt

155
00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:29.700
my feelings I'll see you in the next section.

156
00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:30.250
All right guys.
