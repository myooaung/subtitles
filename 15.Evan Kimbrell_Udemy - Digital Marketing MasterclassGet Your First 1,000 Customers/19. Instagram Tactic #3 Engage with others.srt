00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:00,870
All right, guys.
1

2
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:02,600
Welcome back to the course.
2

3
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:06,930
So the last couple lectures I went over ideas for 
creating Instagram posts that would help create some
3

4
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:11,820
engagement, whether it's through the hashtags you use 
with your post or through creating promotions and
4

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,360
giveaways that could also attract attention.
5

6
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:19,680
But Instagram is a social network, so being social 
and engaging with others has to be part of your
6

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,580
strategy if you want to develop a following of your own.
7

8
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:24,030
You've heard me say this before.
8

9
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:29,550
You can't just push all the time with your sales message
without checking out and getting involved with
9

10
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:31,180
what others do as well.
10

11
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:36,270
So in this lecture I want to give you a simple schedule 
with tasks, so if you follow it, it will increase
11

12
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:38,490
your followers consistently over time.
12

13
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:40,520
You might even enjoy using the platform.
13

14
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,660
Now, a few lectures back, we discussed 
the process for creating a profile.
14

15
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,240
Make sure you go through all of those steps, especially 
the part where you create a bio and include a
15

16
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:51,340
call to action, and obviously put in your URL.
16

17
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:57,350
A descriptive bio will help people understand who you 
are and, to a point, why you're on Instagram. Your
17

18
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,980
pictures and posts will say a lot as well, but your 
engagement with other accounts and their posts will
18

19
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,100
tell the rest of the story.
19

20
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:09,650
People after all don't want to follow corporate 
accounts that are just there to broadcast crap.
20

21
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:14,640
So once you're somewhat established on Instagram,
make sure you follow accounts. Follow ones that you
21

22
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,950
might think might actually be interested in your 
business, your app, or your product, whatever.
22

23
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,270
By following them, you're increasing your chances 
exponentially that they will follow you back, but also
23

24
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:26,570
follow accounts that you like or want to follow just for inspiration.
24

25
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:27,720
follow accounts that you like or want to follow just for inspiration.
25

26
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:32,220
If there are businesses out there creating great posts 
and sharing good information, well, give them a follow.
26

27
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:35,520
Now, what can you do with these 
accounts that you do end up following?
27

28
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:39,440
Well, you can start engaging. 
Every day, try to do the following.
28

29
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:44,910
Number one, like at least 10 posts from other people 
per day. This is actually a pretty low number, especially
29

30
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:46,310
if you follow a bunch of accounts,
30

31
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,850
but the point here is to make a habit of going through 
the feed at least once a day and giving people some love.
31

32
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:51,440
but the point here is to make a habit of going through 
the feed at least once a day and giving people some love.
32

33
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:57,410
I personally can do 10 likes in about two minutes,
because if I'm careful who I'm following, then my feed
33

34
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:01,080
will only show people that are relevant 
that I probably will like the posts from.
34

35
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:05,280
Next thing I say is comment on at least 3-5 posts a day.
35

36
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,500
Now, again, this becomes easier the more accounts 
you follow and could end up being a low number.
36

37
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:12,540
The more engagement you give,
the more you'll get back in return.
37

38
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:16,670
So try to leave something more than 
just "Nice" or "Thumbs up" emoji.
38

39
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,970
Answer a question, give a different 
angle, or tag someone you know
39

40
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:22,880
that would also want to see this post.
40

41
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:29,430
My favorite thing to do is just look at competitors,
then post in the comments answering or retorting
41

42
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:34,500
to people's complaints or what people are saying 
about the product or just being helpful, because a lot
42

43
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,270
of times, competitors will post something 
and then they don't monitor comments,
43

44
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:41,760
so you can kind of swoop in and 
be the one who explains things.
44

45
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:47,550
The next thing I would generally suggest, and this is backed up 
by data, is try to share two posts from other accounts per day.
45

46
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:49,050

46

47
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:51,110
Now, if you're following accounts that inspire you, well,
47

48
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:56,640
that shouldn't be that hard of a task to find two posts
a day that you think are worth sharing and are related
48

49
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,430
to your audience.
49

50
00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:02,440
It could be advice, it could be an informative post, or
just an entertaining video, or just something awesome.
50

51
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:08,880
Share using an app like Repost that visually gives credit on
the image, and then you tag the source in your description,
51

52
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,660
Share using an app like Repost that visually gives credit on
the image, and then you tag the source in your description,
52

53
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,140
but you get to control the rest of it.
53

54
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:15,660
Sharing posts on a consistent basis will get you noticed and 
you might just see some of your posts getting shared in return.
54

55
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:16,440

you might just see some of your posts getting shared in return.
55

56
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,150
Keep in mind obviously that there is a balance to this.
56

57
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:24,480
If you're only going to post once a day organically,
then probably only share one as well, because you
57

58
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:30,110
don't want people will look at your feed necessarily 
and see that it's two thirds someone else's content.
58

59
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:34,650
Instagrammers have followed similar schedules and 
gained over 1,000 followers in a month just by
59

60
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:38,580
engaging with accounts they like and
think bring good stuff to the table.
60

61
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:44,370
Now, 1,000 might not sound like a lot to you, but 
1,000 people who are real, who are interested
61

62
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:48,420
in what you're doing or are a captive 
audience, that actually is a big deal.
62

63
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:52,580
There's a lot of ones out there that have millions 
of followers and a lot of them are fake or they're
63

64
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:57,210
just people that are only loosely aligned with them 
or they're people that follow tons of other people
64

65
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:59,660
as well, and so they can't even get their attention.
65

66
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:03,540
Now, if engagement on your pictures picks up 
and you start getting likes and comments,
66

67
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:05,910
make sure you reinforce this with steps of your own.
67

68
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,410
Follow back some people that have followed you.
68

69
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:11,170
If you click the heart icon on the bottom row of the buttons,
69

70
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:15,360
it'll take you to the feedback screen, where you'll see 
the list of people who followed you today, as well
70

71
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,580
as likes and comments.
71

72
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:21,190
The followers are easy to spot because they'll 
have a big Follow button to the right
72

73
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:25,890
if you don't obviously currently follow them. Now, obviously, 
you don't have to follow them all, but it makes sense to follow
73

74
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:29,220
back some of them and strengthen
the relationship, so to speak.
74

75
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:33,810
Again, try to do this in moderation. People, when they 
look at your profile, will look at how many people you
75

76
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:38,300
follow compared to how many people follow you. You 
want to keep a healthy ratio of that, you don't want
76

77
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,480
5,000 people you're following and then only 
1,000 followers, because it makes it look like
77

78
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:45,370
you're just being ingenuine or you're being run by a bot.
78

79
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:49,500
So try to follow back the ones that are actually 
noteworthy or the ones that actually have engaged in
79

80
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,780
some way, not just following you.
80

81
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:55,380
Next thing I'd say is go into each post and then try to 
actually like some of the comments that you've got.
81

82
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:55,920
Next thing I'd say is go into each post and then try to 
actually like some of the comments that you've got.
82

83
00:04:55,950 --> 00:05:00,360
You don't have to like them all, but definitely show some 
love to the people who took the time say something,
83

84
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:04,890
especially if it was positive. So there you go, there's a
set of tasks that you can keep in mind. If you do them
84

85
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:10,680
every single day, you will grow a following. You 
just like, I don't know, 5-10 posts, try to comment
85

86
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:18,780
on 2-3 of them, and then try to share two posts 
a day if you're, let's say, posting two a day,
86

87
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,340
or one a day if you're posting organically one, and 
then obviously try to follow some of your followers
87

88
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:27,320
and try liking some of their comments. 
Just by doing that with your thumbs,
88

89
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:30,810
that will get you attention. Now, this 
whole process shouldn't take a lot of time,
89

90
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:34,460
but the more you do, the more 
you can expect out of the platform.
90

91
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:38,700
Set aside a time each day to do this, and you should see 
your numbers and engagement build steadily over time.
91

92
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:39,210
Set aside a time each day to do this, and you should see 
your numbers and engagement build steadily over time.
92

93
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:42,690
Personally, the way I like to do it is first 
thing in the morning, when you roll over,
93

94
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:45,600
just open up the platform and just clicky-clicky.
94

95
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,090
All right, guys.
95

96
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:47,460
That's it for Instagram.
96

97
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:48,300
I'll see you guys later.
