WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=LOCAL:00:00:00.000,MPEGTS:0

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
So now we're going to learn how to bid on a project.

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.285
So the simplest way is to find a project for us

00:00:06.285 --> 00:00:09.825
using the keywords like automated testing. So we are going to do that.

00:00:09.825 --> 00:00:12.130
Let me share my screen with you.

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.205
So on the outlook,

00:00:19.205 --> 00:00:21.665
on the top, you can see are committed.

00:00:21.665 --> 00:00:23.945
So you can see the fine gums pen here.

00:00:23.945 --> 00:00:33.200
You would automated testing and try to keep you all really rate low.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.270
So away my profile,

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.015
$60 per hour is slightly higher.

00:00:38.015 --> 00:00:40.160
If you look at the jobs,

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.580
the ammonia willing to pay is between adding.

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.165
Let let's have a look.

00:00:47.165 --> 00:00:50.480
Between 30 to 60 hourly.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.115
So it's it's okay.

00:00:52.115 --> 00:00:57.305
My hourly rate is on a higher end as compared to the job, so widow.

00:00:57.305 --> 00:01:00.050
But I don't mind.

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.870
But for you if you're sauteing onwards suggests keeping it,

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.005
Turkey would be the best thing.

00:01:06.005 --> 00:01:09.785
So for example, I'm interested in this job.

00:01:09.785 --> 00:01:13.500
What I'm gonna do is I'm going to take on a job.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.175
And on top I can see a green button will cease.

00:01:19.175 --> 00:01:21.260
Submit a proposal.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:28.475
I've got 16 valuable connects and it sees acquired connects to submit a proposal is six.

00:01:28.475 --> 00:01:31.415
And if you hover over the question mark,

00:01:31.415 --> 00:01:35.660
since this is a number of Connects acquired to submit a proposal for this job.

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.450
Now, if I click on it again.

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.410
So this job is in the United States.

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:50.135
The things that have been asked in this job is about experience with nor JS Aussie,

00:01:50.135 --> 00:01:54.770
Phyton, some experience with a black box

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:00.335
and white box testing strong analytical problem-solving decision-making skills.

00:02:00.335 --> 00:02:04.684
And the questions are, you will be asked to answer the following questions.

00:02:04.684 --> 00:02:06.290
Friends submit a proposal.

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.380
What cryptocurrency volatile excuse Have you use?

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.360
How familiar are you with cryptocurrency?

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.310
What do you think you are going to?

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.390
Well, why do you think you are going to fit for this particular project?

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:18.710
Okay.

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:21.870
So submit a proposal.

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.920
Let's start with this.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.695
Milla is belive, AFL and range.

00:02:26.695 --> 00:02:30.610
This is an Arabic saying.

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.330
If you start with the word Bismol lie recommended Rahim,

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.470
you're more likely to get your job Gattaca bleeding.

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.570
So that's why I said dead.

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:45.745
So proposal settings, automated testing.

00:02:45.745 --> 00:02:49.780
That's fine. Dms, $60 an hour.

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.940
That's what I have gotten.

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.520
Leopard fuzzy has picked up automatically.

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.320
Here as a cover letter.

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.820
I would basically save.

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.765
So inequality, you're basically giving some credibility about yourself,

00:03:11.765 --> 00:03:13.220
like who you are,

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.000
and what do you think about?

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.010
I mean, it's more about yourselves,

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.240
like I'll probably write data we

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:31.410
give in the cover letter by UR.

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.510
Press ten beaded.

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.590
Far.

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:49.310
What would we say by your desk and it wouldn't be like your credibly yes.

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.995
Your credibility.

00:03:51.995 --> 00:03:56.780
And in here, what x changes?

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.875
Why do you think you're a good fit for this particular project?

00:04:00.875 --> 00:04:01.220
Yes.

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.135
So this is where you are going to explain why you up the best fit for this project.

00:04:05.135 --> 00:04:07.955
Like here, you are going to talk about your credibility.

00:04:07.955 --> 00:04:10.190
So if I were you,

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:11.810
I would basically to talk about,

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:16.520
I've done training programs like Fuck assemble discourse.

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:18.380
You can refer to discourse and a cover letter.

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:24.560
You can talk about some examples that you have fact-based and techniques that, you know.

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.545
For example, if over here I can mention,

00:04:27.545 --> 00:04:31.595
it says by peeking into what they are looking for.

00:04:31.595 --> 00:04:34.370
So skills and experience a glide.

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:38.240
So he can copy most of the things from

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:46.320
here and tell them.

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:53.490
Hello.

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:59.890
My name is combined, runs off.

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:05.000
And I have got

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:12.535
now I didn't say my experiences more than 15 years,

00:05:12.535 --> 00:05:15.970
but that is not what the client is looking for.

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:18.280
So you can say,

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:28.270
My name is cameras and have been walking in the industry.

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:35.270
Press automation in Guinea.

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:39.630
Push aspect

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:49.350
for three-plus years.

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.015
Because he asks what Craigslist's use X1, X2,

00:05:53.015 --> 00:06:00.230
X3 plus years on prepubescent means 1520 or a 100 isn't met a fruitless.

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:04.050
So that's, that's how I incorporated that.

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:08.855
Now he's talking about ru flamed in English.

00:06:08.855 --> 00:06:19.500
I'm flowing in English language.

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:27.200
And happy whose zoom calls all this guy, if necessary.

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:39.475
Then is talking about strong proficiency off desk frameworks.

00:06:39.475 --> 00:06:49.100
So I'm phi shunt in MLK cod Chai, puppet.

00:06:56.370 --> 00:07:07.740
And just sorry, just and Cyprus.

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:16.445
And then next thing is experience.

00:07:16.445 --> 00:07:21.005
I have got a good X credence, writ,

00:07:21.005 --> 00:07:28.320
Kafka, MySQL and big arthritis.

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:38.820
But m coefficient, OJS.

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:44.490
And see.

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:52.890
I have written many scripts in Python.

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:58.379
Significant experience, all working in software development teams.

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:08.840
Referred to look in teams in

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:14.885
a dull manner that

00:08:14.885 --> 00:08:22.970
can be pulled in.

00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:26.570
And please any issues.

00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:29.180
I also enjoy

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:37.655
walking in as now,

00:08:37.655 --> 00:08:40.040
he's asking a more wide bugs on black-box testing.

00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:44.570
So what white box testing means is that you can see that code

00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:49.610
and you need to test us off by looking at the quote, I blogged.

00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:52.490
That black box testing means that you cannot see anything.

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:56.300
You just testing the app from a flexible right now,

00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:58.775
become see how I'll flip was created.

00:08:58.775 --> 00:09:00.800
And if somebody else has to test,

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:03.095
this is walk, we got God.

00:09:03.095 --> 00:09:06.150
So we don't know that internal locus.

00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:14.645
So I have got the experience of white and black box testing.

00:09:14.645 --> 00:09:17.675
You can do I'd better with ice is sought a ship.

00:09:17.675 --> 00:09:21.440
Strong analytical problem-solving and decision-making skills,

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:25.500
ability to stay on schedule and produces up sometime Eva.

00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:40.050
I will indicate. Any.

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:50.510
Issues in well in advance.

00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:57.695
I feel the line fall

00:09:57.695 --> 00:10:06.990
reliquary like impacted quality is my.

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:20.555
So here we can write them out something about quality and also something about risk.

00:10:20.555 --> 00:10:27.650
So enjoy the balance

00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:38.400
between quality and communicate grid.

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:48.920
Formed and September this rich helps the codec

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:51.770
delivered on time

00:10:51.770 --> 00:10:53.490
and

00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:02.285
MIT feature

00:11:02.285 --> 00:11:04.440
migrations.

00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:09.740
So that was my cover letter.

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:11.600
As you can see, I haven't copied,

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:13.130
pasted it from anywhere else.

00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:18.365
I've used Klein's loadings and I've converted that into a calculator on that.

00:11:18.365 --> 00:11:20.495
That is what client likes.

00:11:20.495 --> 00:11:29.255
Basically, he likes to see his wordings being used because that is what He has requested.

00:11:29.255 --> 00:11:32.820
This this thing is called mirroring.

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:35.540
Okay.

00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:37.670
So what's the next thing that died is asking

00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:41.615
us what cryptocurrencies and mold have to use.

00:11:41.615 --> 00:11:46.430
So I've use venn rate coin,

00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:56.670
light coin a currently use

00:12:05.170 --> 00:12:11.370
coinbase. I have

00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:23.510
Bitcoin creating exchange,

00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:29.430
which will be mindfully created.

00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:42.620
It meets my colleague Grice.

00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:51.740
I have also done creating in light coin and men.

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:04.555
I guess that's basically what do you think?

00:13:04.555 --> 00:13:08.050
Why do you think you're a good fit for this particular project?

00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:11.770
Ok, this is the most important question that he's looking for.

00:13:11.770 --> 00:13:16.270
Like, why lie you lie to someone else?

00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:22.645
So first thing that he mentioned over here was the Milky, right?

00:13:22.645 --> 00:13:31.825
So you can see a way you can walk remotely without any issues.

00:13:31.825 --> 00:13:37.435
As I have brought up, whole office setup.

00:13:37.435 --> 00:13:41.470
It's number one waits and what's the next reason?

00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:48.460
Only he'll say says no one on the team to the micromanage view.

00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:50.305
You need to be salad motivational.

00:13:50.305 --> 00:13:53.090
So I'll just use his winnings again.

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:59.720
I am self motivated in the visual

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:06.335
is so self motivated.

00:14:06.335 --> 00:14:11.420
Individual was excited about quality.

00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:19.950
So stri, using some good words so that he can see your passion.

00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:24.480
I'm a self-motivated, unusual who's excited about

00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:34.320
oligarchy and cryptocurrency? Thing.

00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:40.250
Cripple, currency is the future of wealth and

00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:45.875
money to creating some statements like bees because it helps them.

00:14:45.875 --> 00:14:47.810
So over here basically in this question,

00:14:47.810 --> 00:14:49.985
decline is looking for groupings.

00:14:49.985 --> 00:14:53.099
Are you by shared and all you're interested.

00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:06.360
And he has mentioned the name of the company most valued.

00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:20.555
So I'll see if I can understand quota log.

00:15:20.555 --> 00:15:26.555
So I will write down honestly what I I do understand what I don't.

00:15:26.555 --> 00:15:32.210
So I have logged

00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:41.165
as software in Kenya in the past,

00:15:41.165 --> 00:15:51.900
which means I can understand debug code.

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:59.610
And we'll get growth features and see.

00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:09.860
I'm passionate about sulfur quality,

00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:17.585
which is why I choose become now what,

00:16:17.585 --> 00:16:19.055
whatever my tiger loss.

00:16:19.055 --> 00:16:23.150
So I'm just gonna click because these things connect.

00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:29.870
So okay, so he's

00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:36.035
looking for software development engineering does so I'm just going to use this one.

00:16:36.035 --> 00:16:42.050
For determining the data doesn't go look.

00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:46.860
Lynn. Leukemia test.

00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:52.725
Okay.

00:16:52.725 --> 00:17:01.790
And unnecessary because somebody to say you want to learn to

00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:10.685
deal with desk plus like an unlit spring.

00:17:10.685 --> 00:17:17.220
That's going my usage models and got a look past lens.

00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:29.000
Paul ERP, live braggart,

00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:36.610
repost, bloke.

00:17:36.610 --> 00:17:40.850
But Kafka is creams.

00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:43.750
Be connected.

00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:45.920
Marty people.

00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:52.840
Lacquer services with Kafka to

00:17:52.840 --> 00:18:01.045
transform that data on the fly rather than exploring it in.

00:18:01.045 --> 00:18:02.530
You've got lease.

00:18:02.530 --> 00:18:10.045
The final output while stood in S3 and R1 plus.

00:18:10.045 --> 00:18:13.029
Well, this points will fall.

So so that can make informed decisions.

why I should be a good fit for this job.

00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:36.085

00:22:36.085 --> 00:22:39.080
And I would like them to go.

00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:43.375
Okay, so that's basically it.

00:22:43.375 --> 00:22:45.730
Now I'm going to click on submit a proposal.

00:22:45.730 --> 00:22:49.075
This will send a proposal to the client.

00:22:49.075 --> 00:22:55.400
And because I have used a wedding that client used in his job description,

00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:59.945
this supposedly is more likely to be looking at

00:22:59.945 --> 00:23:06.305
and then climb might get back to me in my messages and asks me for a few more abortions.

00:23:06.305 --> 00:23:10.100
And I need to have that ability to satisfy him.

00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:14.420
So try it, try sending multiple proposals.

00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:17.675
Initially, you might not get the job,

00:23:17.675 --> 00:23:20.720
but you will learn from it. You will get better.

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:25.190
And that will be a point of a client's would be requesting you to take on login.

00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:26.960
You wouldn't have much time to do it.

00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:29.045
So looking forward to that.

00:23:29.045 --> 00:23:30.810
Thank you.
