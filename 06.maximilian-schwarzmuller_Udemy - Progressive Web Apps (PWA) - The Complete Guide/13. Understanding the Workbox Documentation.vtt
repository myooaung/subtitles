WEBVTT

00:02.050 --> 00:07.360
Before we see what else we can do in the project, I want to minify some assets to give you a hint.

00:07.430 --> 00:10.560
I want to log you through the workbox documentation here.

00:10.590 --> 00:16.250
Now chances are that it changes slightly but the general structure probably stays the same.

00:16.250 --> 00:18.890
Unfortunately, it's not the best documentation I ever saw,

00:18.920 --> 00:23.370
so I find it important to also show you how to read it.

00:23.510 --> 00:29.060
Now if you go to workboxjs.org, you start on the main page. On this page, you can actually get

00:29.060 --> 00:32.140
a quick start guide on your favorite build system,

00:32.360 --> 00:36.920
for example if you use npm, use the workbox-cli as we just did

00:37.250 --> 00:39.280
and unfortunately this is outdated,

00:39.320 --> 00:44.120
the command now is just workbox, not workbox-cli but we already saw this here

00:44.120 --> 00:46.920
basically, this is the approach we took.

00:46.940 --> 00:50.680
Now if you're using Gulp, you can follow the steps outlined there

00:51.110 --> 00:54.060
and if you use webpack, you can find the steps here.

00:54.110 --> 00:59.120
One important take away, the configuration for the module, for example here webpack

00:59.360 --> 01:01.350
is the same as on the CLI,

01:01.610 --> 01:08.080
so all your options you saw here in our workbox-cli-config, you could pass them to your webpack module

01:08.090 --> 01:09.070
config too

01:09.170 --> 01:13.280
as you can see here. Here you see just some options but all are supported.

01:13.550 --> 01:14.450
That's important,

01:14.450 --> 01:16.300
that's why I showed you the other approach,

01:16.310 --> 01:20.860
it's the generic approach and here we pass the same options.

01:20.870 --> 01:27.050
Now if you embed this in your webpack or in Gulp workflow, an advantage of course is that it will automatically

01:27.050 --> 01:31.070
run this and rebuild your service worker whenever you update one of your files,

01:31.070 --> 01:32.210
one of your assets.

01:32.300 --> 01:34.270
So you don't have to run this manually

01:34.430 --> 01:39.620
and this is the only thing for this right now, you have to keep in mind to run it manually when using

01:39.620 --> 01:41.410
this npm approach.

01:42.270 --> 01:46.700
However I'll also automate this a bit more in the next lectures.

01:46.740 --> 01:54.200
So this is the general starting guide, now to dive deeper into the different options and so on,

01:54.360 --> 01:56.630
this is the part where it gets tricky.

01:56.850 --> 01:58.570
You can check out the examples,

01:58.590 --> 02:01.040
for example this full example.

02:01.170 --> 02:07.500
Now here if you scroll down, you see an example set up with precaching and also with the router.

02:07.950 --> 02:15.870
Now the router also has a more complex set up or has more options it offers you and you can find out

02:15.870 --> 02:19.050
which it has by going to reference and then it's workbox-sw

02:19.080 --> 02:19.960
.

02:20.010 --> 02:22.470
Don't get confused by all these packages,

02:22.470 --> 02:29.880
workbox-sw wraps most of them and you can also dive into the individual packages to utilize all the

02:29.880 --> 02:31.680
features of a given package

02:31.830 --> 02:34.720
but that is very advanced, for most cases,

02:34.740 --> 02:37.290
workbox-sw should suffice.

02:37.290 --> 02:40.500
Now if you click on that, you'll find a documentation on it

02:40.560 --> 02:43.560
and of course that's true for all these packages. Now

02:43.610 --> 02:46.930
in there, you see that precache can be used like this

02:46.980 --> 02:53.670
but keep in mind, this gets populated automatically when using inject manifest or generate-sw and

02:53.670 --> 02:56.080
then you see how you set up routes for example.

02:56.160 --> 02:58.810
The interesting part comes if we scroll down on this page,

02:59.040 --> 03:01.170
you see the class is wrapped by workbox-sw.

03:01.170 --> 03:09.120
That's workbox-sw itself which you set up with new self workbox-sw, you see this command here

03:09.120 --> 03:12.810
in the sw-base.js file, here.

03:13.410 --> 03:15.550
So this is how you initialize this package

03:15.750 --> 03:24.540
and there you see you could pass an object to it to configure this. So you could pass an object where

03:24.540 --> 03:30.200
you for example set up a cache ID and you see descriptions when you might want to use which option here.

03:30.390 --> 03:35.130
Now most of the options are probably not required but it's good to know that you can add them if you

03:35.130 --> 03:36.750
need to.

03:36.750 --> 03:42.060
You'll also see that here you see this router thing we were accessing and this strategies thing we were

03:42.060 --> 03:44.920
accessing, as well as this precache method.

03:45.360 --> 03:51.450
Now if you click on strategies here, you'll see how you use a strategy and you can click on that link

03:51.690 --> 03:57.660
to see a list of all the strategies and click on a strategy to read more about it, down there, learn

03:57.660 --> 04:01.870
more about the strategy options and this is how you navigate through this.

04:01.920 --> 04:08.880
Start with the objects, the commands you're using like workbox.strategies and click on it to learn more

04:08.880 --> 04:09.580
about it,

04:09.660 --> 04:14.740
the same for the router. Click on router and you can learn more about the router here.

04:15.530 --> 04:18.490
This now shows you how you use the router,

04:18.740 --> 04:25.430
for example here with strategies cache first or your custom handler. There you also see what you can

04:25.430 --> 04:27.010
access on that args thing,

04:27.020 --> 04:33.680
we were using args event but you can also get any URL or params if you were using an Express route

04:33.690 --> 04:41.530
for example, with colon something. And you also learn more about the register route method which you

04:41.530 --> 04:42.370
were calling,

04:42.380 --> 04:49.760
so this method. To access this for example, you'll learn more about what you can pass as a first argument,

04:49.980 --> 04:56.300
a string, a regular expression or this function I showed you and how you can create your own handler

04:57.110 --> 04:58.170
and so on.

04:58.190 --> 05:01.670
This is how you can move through this workbox documentation,

05:01.910 --> 05:08.630
as I said, not the best documentation in the world but a place to start at least. Now some useful links

05:08.630 --> 05:11.010
can be found in the last section of this module

05:11.120 --> 05:15.550
but I found it important to explain how you can work with that on your own too.
