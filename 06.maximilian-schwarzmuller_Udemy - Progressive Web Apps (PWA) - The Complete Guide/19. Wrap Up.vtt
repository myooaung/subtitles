00:02.430 --> 00:11.040
So in this module, we made sure that our application can go from this, when being offline to this state

00:11.130 --> 00:17.280
when being offline by adding service worker caching, a core feature of service workers,

00:17.360 --> 00:22.800
one we will greatly enhance in the next course module but one which already does a great job for

00:22.830 --> 00:26.760
all our static assets due to our work in this module.

00:26.760 --> 00:32.550
With that, let's not lose any time and continue on this road and let's enhance our service worker even

00:32.550 --> 00:33.030
more.
