WEBVTT

00:02.080 --> 00:08.470
We did a lot in this course and now we have a working application running on a real host using all

00:08.460 --> 00:09.780
these features we implemented,

00:09.820 --> 00:11.140
that's really amazing.

00:11.140 --> 00:15.910
We have access to the camera, we have access to the location at least if we have Internet which we should have

00:15.910 --> 00:23.820
now and we also can do all of that offline, we can even use our app offline due to caching.

00:24.190 --> 00:31.500
Now I showed you lightbox at the beginning of this course, this tool by Google to audit our application,

00:31.780 --> 00:36.790
let's run this audit again now. In the latest version of Chrome, you should have this audit tab in the

00:36.790 --> 00:38.020
developer tools.

00:38.020 --> 00:42.790
If you don't, simply visit the Google lighthouse page and followed installation steps there to

00:42.820 --> 00:44.570
install it as a Chrome extension,

00:44.590 --> 00:47.090
you will need Chrome to use it though.

00:47.200 --> 00:53.170
Now lighthouse is a tool which allows you to audit your progressive web apps for performance, accessibility

00:53.170 --> 00:54.480
and so on.

00:54.490 --> 00:57.230
Now I'm really interested in seeing how it performs.

00:57.310 --> 01:03.790
So running on a real server, let's perform an audit, run the audit on all these categories and let's see

01:03.790 --> 01:06.020
which score we get on this application

01:06.040 --> 01:09.340
with all the features we added. Now don't worry if it looks strange

01:09.340 --> 01:11.340
during the audit, that's absolutely normal,

01:11.350 --> 01:16.030
it's just testing different things with the application and it will take awhile and

01:16.070 --> 01:23.300
in the end, we will get a score to see how well our application performs and what we can improve.

01:23.320 --> 01:25.170
I'll be back once it finished.

01:25.330 --> 01:28.740
Here's the result and the result is really good,

01:28.750 --> 01:33.130
a 100 in progressive web app is amazing.

01:33.130 --> 01:35.350
Now here's one important note,

01:35.350 --> 01:42.580
the results you get here may vary because the Google lighthouse tool is constantly evolving, adding new

01:42.580 --> 01:45.630
checks and making it tougher to get high scores.

01:45.820 --> 01:52.800
So maybe you get a worse score, still you will get useful insights down there into what you could improve

01:53.140 --> 01:56.200
and I recommend going through these things anyways.

01:56.230 --> 01:58.480
Check what you passed to see what you're doing

01:58.480 --> 01:59.070
good,

01:59.080 --> 02:06.010
for example serving over https, also we'll have a look at these manual checks which could be done automatically

02:06.490 --> 02:08.980
and have a look at the other categories too.

02:08.980 --> 02:12.790
Now here for example, you see performance-wise, we could improve this

02:12.820 --> 02:17.320
for example by optimizing our images. It gives you some hints here.

02:17.350 --> 02:22.260
Now this is really slow because I think my internet connection isn't the best right now too.

02:22.600 --> 02:27.500
In general, you want to have a look at this and see when you get your first meaningful paint,

02:27.550 --> 02:33.670
when your application is interactive, that should be below 5 seconds to be really good and that of course

02:33.670 --> 02:38.530
means when your users are able to use your app even if they have a bad internet connection.

02:38.590 --> 02:40.710
Again as you can see with the screenshots,

02:40.720 --> 02:44.250
the biggest issue I have is that my images are loading late.

02:44.260 --> 02:45.950
It's interacting very quickly

02:46.030 --> 02:48.520
but images are loading because they're not optimized,

02:48.520 --> 02:49.930
that wasn't the goal of this app.

02:49.960 --> 02:52.790
In a real app where you let your users upload images,

02:52.870 --> 02:58.420
you'll probably want to have some automatic process optimizing them and you even might want to optimize this

02:58.450 --> 03:00.440
main image a little bit more.

03:00.460 --> 03:06.790
Now here you see the opportunities, for example you'll see that the stylesheets took relatively long to

03:06.790 --> 03:07.050
load

03:07.050 --> 03:12.580
here, definitely a hint that my connection isn't that bad because we don't have big stylesheets and you

03:12.580 --> 03:13.810
might inline them.

03:13.900 --> 03:16.840
You see the text compression and the image hints here too.

03:17.230 --> 03:23.590
We also have a look at accessibility where we see that we could improve the contrast of background

03:23.590 --> 03:24.880
and foreground colors

03:24.970 --> 03:26.900
but besides that, we're doing good

03:27.520 --> 03:33.380
and besides that, we could remove this meta tag which I use on purpose though

03:33.400 --> 03:38.830
but I discuss this meta tag and potential issues earlier in the course. We're also seeing what we're

03:38.830 --> 03:42.480
doing good and you see which best practices we're following,

03:42.580 --> 03:46.650
so you see, you didn't learn that much bad stuff in this course.

03:46.810 --> 03:50.230
So this is the audit with which I want to conclude this application,

03:50.230 --> 03:52.180
definitely a satisfying result,

03:52.270 --> 03:57.070
definitely showing that we did a lot of things right and definitely showing that you're well prepared

03:57.310 --> 04:03.470
to use the many things you learned here, to practice them and apply them in your upcoming web projects.

04:03.520 --> 04:05.930
Now I'm not entirely done with this course though,

04:06.160 --> 04:08.850
I want to guide you into other directions

04:08.860 --> 04:14.860
you might want to have a look at in the future and I also want to have a look at how we use single page

04:14.860 --> 04:21.370
applications built with React, Angular or Vue in conjunction with progressive web apps. We'll do that in

04:21.370 --> 04:22.620
the next course module.
