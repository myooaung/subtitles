WEBVTT

00:02.090 --> 00:05.370
In the last module, we had a brief look at responsive design,

00:05.380 --> 00:11.100
now I want to come back to some of the different technologies we can use to create a progressive web app

00:11.440 --> 00:16.210
and one important feature we can implement is background synchronization.

00:16.360 --> 00:18.230
It's a relatively new feature,

00:18.250 --> 00:24.870
browser support is still growing but already there for some important browsers and background synchronization

00:24.880 --> 00:30.910
allows you to do one important thing, synchronize your data even if the user is offline while sending

00:30.910 --> 00:31.650
it.

00:31.660 --> 00:38.700
Imagine this situation, you have an offline ready application as we do and the user of course can navigate

00:38.710 --> 00:41.650
around there and can load and see your data

00:41.920 --> 00:44.860
but he can't send data if he's offline.

00:44.860 --> 00:52.390
Now after this module, we'll be able to store requests we want to send in our application if we are offline

00:52.390 --> 00:55.930
and send them once connectivity is re-established.

00:55.930 --> 00:56.930
Sounds awesome,

00:56.950 --> 00:58.060
it really is

00:58.060 --> 00:59.560
and I can't wait to get started

00:59.560 --> 01:02.600
so let's dive into background synchronization.
