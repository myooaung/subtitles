I hope you enjoyed the module. In this module, we created our own service worker and we registered it

00:08.900 --> 00:10.430
in our application,

00:10.550 --> 00:14.660
we made sure that it is registered for every page in our application

00:14.660 --> 00:21.290
and with that, we supercharged our manifest.json file which now allows Chrome on Android to install

00:21.290 --> 00:23.240
our app on the home screen.

00:23.360 --> 00:28.500
Besides that, one other important thing happened. With the service worker set up,

00:28.580 --> 00:34.490
we already got some knowledge about how it works behind the scenes and what it does there in the background.

00:34.550 --> 00:41.510
We can now take that knowledge and build up on it to add more powerful features, like for example caching

00:41.630 --> 00:43.780
which also requires service workers.

00:44.120 --> 00:51.650
One important note, always keep in mind that service workers require SSL, so https has to be used on your

00:51.650 --> 00:58.380
page except for your local development environment and you might also have noticed that in the service

00:58.650 --> 01:04.040
worker here, we're using some strange things like fetch and that in general,

01:04.040 --> 01:06.620
we also work with promises in this course.

01:06.650 --> 01:13.100
Now maybe that's all stuff you already know, in case you don't, in the next module we'll have a brief refresher

01:13.100 --> 01:17.990
about promises and the fetch API so that we're all on the same page.
