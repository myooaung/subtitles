So let's dive into progressive web web apps by answering one important question first, what are progressive

00:08.180 --> 00:09.320
web apps?

00:09.320 --> 00:15.810
It's a term which you might have heard already but sometimes it's hard to really say what it means, in

00:15.850 --> 00:20.500
the end progressive web apps is just a term referring to a couple of features

00:20.540 --> 00:24.750
you can add to any web application, to any web page running in the browser

00:24.750 --> 00:27.520
therefore to enhance it.

00:27.520 --> 00:30.080
This is what progressive web apps in the end are about -

00:30.080 --> 00:37.610
you progressively enhance your existing web pages to feel and work more like native mobile apps.

00:37.610 --> 00:43.550
I'm not just talking about responsive design, so that it looks good on both devices, we're doing that

00:43.550 --> 00:45.200
since a couple of years already

00:45.230 --> 00:50.990
or you should be at least, I'm talking about other things you know from native mobile apps, like your

00:50.990 --> 00:53.030
app working if you're offline,

00:53.090 --> 01:00.110
it's having an icon on the home screen, things like accessing the device camera or the location, synchronizing

01:00.110 --> 01:01.460
data in the background.

01:01.730 --> 01:06.140
These are all features which were hard to do in web applications in the past,

01:06.320 --> 01:14.330
nowadays we got browser support in a lot of browsers for that and we can therefore use that. Now in this

01:14.330 --> 01:19.680
course, I will show you how to use all these technologies which make up a progressive web app

01:19.730 --> 01:24.830
and of course I'll also explain which technologies these are and I will show you how to implement them

01:24.860 --> 01:31.490
in a way that it also works on older browsers, that your web page still works on older browsers because

01:31.550 --> 01:32.700
that's the core thing,

01:32.780 --> 01:35.750
you progressively enhance a web application.

01:35.780 --> 01:37.650
It's not an all or nothing move,

01:37.670 --> 01:40.550
it's not like it doesn't work on older browsers anymore,

01:40.760 --> 01:46.090
it just means if you have a modern browser on a mobile device, you get an awesome experience

01:46.190 --> 01:48.460
otherwise you'll get the experience you've gotten

01:48.500 --> 01:54.830
anyways. There are three main words I'd say but which you can summarize

01:54.860 --> 02:00.920
progressive web apps - they should be reliable which means they should load fast and even work if you're

02:00.920 --> 02:06.080
offline, at least a part of the application should work if you're offline.

02:06.080 --> 02:09.830
Now this is really a core thing of progressive web apps,

02:09.830 --> 02:12.300
we're talking a lot about that initial load,

02:12.440 --> 02:17.750
the first time you visit an application when you open it because if you consider an application running

02:17.750 --> 02:18.890
on your mobile device,

02:19.130 --> 02:24.880
most of them start up pretty fast, so long loading times you don't want that.

02:25.280 --> 02:32.090
Additionally it should be fast, not just during load up but also once it runs, it should react to user

02:32.090 --> 02:32.970
input,

02:32.990 --> 02:40.330
it should provide animations, it should be able to access native device features in an intuitive way

02:40.700 --> 02:46.700
and we also want to make sure that it's engaging. We want to get our users back into the app, we want

02:46.700 --> 02:51.850
to offer features like push notifications to inform them even if the application is closed,

02:51.920 --> 02:53.420
yes you heard that correctly, this

02:53.570 --> 02:57.830
is what you can do and what we will do in this course.

02:57.830 --> 03:02.350
So that is what makes up a progressive web app.

03:02.410 --> 03:05.090
Now why would we want to build one?

03:05.090 --> 03:10.520
Obviously we have some good arguments here but couldn't we achieve the same by just building a normal

03:10.550 --> 03:15.990
mobile app with Java, Android or with Swift Objective-C?

03:16.280 --> 03:22.230
Well, let's find out which arguments speak for a web app instead of a native mobile app.
