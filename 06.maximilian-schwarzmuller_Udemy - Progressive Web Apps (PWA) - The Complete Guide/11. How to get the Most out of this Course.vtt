00:02.140 --> 00:06.330
So we're almost set to get started with the meat of this course.

00:06.390 --> 00:12.700
How do you get the most out of this course? Well this course has a lot of videos, some assignments, a quiz,

00:12.870 --> 00:15.260
so a lot of content you can consume.

00:15.300 --> 00:22.550
I definitely encourage you to code along, do the assignments and also code along during the videos. Pause

00:22.580 --> 00:24.510
the videos if I'm talking too fast,

00:24.680 --> 00:29.970
use the playback speed adjustment in the Udemy player to speed up or slow down if I'm going too fast

00:29.970 --> 00:33.860
or slow for you and make sure that you really follow along,

00:33.870 --> 00:37.590
this is how you practice the most and how you learn the most.

00:37.600 --> 00:45.260
Now if you get stuck, check my source code, I attached a lot of source code files throughout this course.

00:45.330 --> 00:51.550
You can always find all the source code for a given module attached to the last lecture of this module

00:51.840 --> 00:57.480
but also in-between, you'll see that a lot of lectures have a zip file attached which holds a snapshot

00:57.480 --> 01:00.870
of the code as we had it at the end of the lecture

01:00.870 --> 01:05.020
it is attached to. Download this code and compare it with yours,

01:05.190 --> 01:10.500
chances are this allows you to find the error you had in your code.

01:10.500 --> 01:16.340
Additionally, ask and of course also answer in the Q&A section of this course,

01:16.350 --> 01:22.440
I'm happy to assist you there but sometimes you learn more by answering.

01:22.440 --> 01:24.110
Asking is always easy,

01:24.120 --> 01:26.250
first try to answer it for yourself,

01:26.340 --> 01:27.140
Google it,

01:27.150 --> 01:29.680
try to find the error by comparing the code.

01:29.970 --> 01:34.230
If you can't find it, definitely ask but also help other students.

01:34.260 --> 01:40.150
If you answer other questions, you challenge yourself and you learn way more than if you had just asked,

01:40.170 --> 01:41.880
so definitely keep this in mind,

01:41.880 --> 01:45.560
this is one of the ways we actually learn the most

01:45.690 --> 01:51.860
and besides that, practice, practice, practice. You need to practice these things,

01:52.080 --> 01:57.750
I'll give you a complete walk through all the core features but in the end, you have to practice them.

01:57.780 --> 02:01.700
You have to put them into your next project, into your existing project,

02:01.740 --> 02:04.260
you have to fail and try again,

02:04.260 --> 02:09.220
this is how you will excel and how you will become a master of progressive web apps.
