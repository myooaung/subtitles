00:02.100 --> 00:04.190
So let's dive into responsive design.

00:04.190 --> 00:06.860
Now as mentioned, I won't dive too deeply into it,

00:06.920 --> 00:11.960
there are whole courses about responsive designs and there is so much you can do about it.

00:12.020 --> 00:18.470
You can go all the way from which units to pick over how you structure your layout to using responsive

00:18.470 --> 00:21.940
images. In this course, in this module here,

00:22.190 --> 00:27.440
I want to give you some resources where you can dive deeper and I want to focus on the latter two points

00:27.440 --> 00:28.070
I mentioned,

00:28.190 --> 00:33.750
how to create responsive layouts and how to use images in a responsive way.

00:33.950 --> 00:36.150
Even there you can dive much deeper

00:36.260 --> 00:42.620
and I want to focus on the features we can add to create a progressive web app and not so much on the

00:42.620 --> 00:43.890
responsive design.

00:44.090 --> 00:49.400
I will say that though, a true progressive web app of course is responsive.

00:49.520 --> 00:55.760
If our goal is to recreate a native mobile app feeling, we obviously have to make sure our application

00:55.760 --> 01:01.410
looks and works nice on mobile devices, basically works and looks nice on all devices.

01:01.550 --> 01:02.570
So it is important,

01:02.690 --> 01:08.030
it's just that there are so many resources that I don't unnecessarily want to bloat this course since

01:08.030 --> 01:11.170
you could spend an entire course just on that topic.

01:11.330 --> 01:16.610
So let's have a look at the core things I want to discuss in this course or I want to have a look at

01:16.700 --> 01:23.000
in this course. That is that you should use CSS media queries to adjust your layout and design and

01:23.010 --> 01:28.730
of course I'll show this concept in code in a second. CSS media queries allow you to apply different

01:29.240 --> 01:34.170
CSS styles depending on the width and/or height of the given device,

01:34.370 --> 01:41.540
so by using these queries, you can decide that a certain box should be let's say 300 pixels wide on bigger

01:41.540 --> 01:49.040
devices and only 100 pixels wide on smaller devices. Combined with that, we obviously want to follow a

01:49.040 --> 01:53.570
mobile first paradigm when developing progressive web apps.

01:53.570 --> 01:57.120
Our goal is to recreate a native mobile app like feeling,

01:57.200 --> 02:03.680
so obviously we should develop for mobile. What mobile first means something is also I'll show you in the

02:03.680 --> 02:04.850
next lectures

02:05.640 --> 02:08.300
and finally, there are images. Now

02:08.310 --> 02:12.270
images can be made responsive in two ways.

02:12.270 --> 02:18.090
For one, you can of course style them in a responsive way, so use media queries to adjust the size and

02:18.090 --> 02:18.730
so on

02:18.990 --> 02:24.930
but you can also decide which image file should get loaded because you probably don't need that big

02:24.930 --> 02:27.920
high density file on a small device,

02:28.020 --> 02:30.820
you might save that for a huge desktop screen.

02:30.900 --> 02:36.180
So these are the core topics I want to dive into briefly in this module to get you thinking about it

02:36.240 --> 02:41.610
so that you have it in mind and I can only encourage you to dive into dedicated courses and tutorials

02:41.850 --> 02:47.590
which then dive much deeper into all the features you can use to create responsive designs

02:47.610 --> 02:49.560
with CSS and HTML.
