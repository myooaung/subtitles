00:02.170 --> 00:08.020
Our project here managed by workbox is taking shape, now I'm missing the code to handle background

00:08.020 --> 00:10.180
synchronization and push messages.

00:10.330 --> 00:11.880
That's going to be easy though.

00:12.040 --> 00:19.060
We can just grab the service worker, the old one and now let's grab all the code regarding background synchronization

00:19.060 --> 00:25.840
and push messages because there's no fitting workbox implementation for that right now, probably coming

00:25.840 --> 00:26.520
up too

00:26.620 --> 00:33.220
but for now, we can just use our default code and we can add this after workbox precache of course.

00:33.220 --> 00:35.530
Now that also holds an important lesson,

00:35.530 --> 00:37.750
you can still write your own code here,

00:37.780 --> 00:39.590
it's a valid service worker file,

00:39.610 --> 00:41.160
definitely keep that in mind

00:41.320 --> 00:43.090
and that's why this will still work,

00:43.110 --> 00:45.160
it's a normal service worker.

00:45.520 --> 00:52.480
You only can take advantage of workbox to make that whole caching thing, with cache management and dynamic

00:52.480 --> 00:54.020
caching easier,

00:54.160 --> 00:57.080
in the end, it's just a service worker file.

00:57.160 --> 01:07.410
So with this added, let's rerun generate-sw and with that executed, let's reload our application one

01:07.410 --> 01:08.320
more time,

01:09.450 --> 01:14.670
let's now go to our realtime database and clear any subscriptions because we invalidated the old ones

01:14.670 --> 01:16.730
and I want to start fresh

01:16.930 --> 01:21.540
and now I will reload this page one more time.

01:21.550 --> 01:24.200
First of all, enable notifications,

01:24.390 --> 01:29.260
I still had the permission granted but I need it to set up a new subscription which is now stored here

01:30.180 --> 01:32.480
and now let's try the full program again.

01:32.640 --> 01:35.670
I'll really go offline by turning off my Wi-Fi 

01:36.880 --> 01:40.680
and I'll reload the page first of all

01:40.880 --> 01:42.850
and I did this too early,

01:42.850 --> 01:43.660
good catch,

01:43.660 --> 01:47.560
we need to reload this one more time of course after initializing the new service worker to have a

01:47.560 --> 01:49.710
chance for dynamic caching to work.

01:49.720 --> 01:53.620
Now I can turn off my internet connection and reload the page,

01:53.830 --> 01:55.880
you see it's working. Now

01:55.960 --> 01:57.840
I want to take a picture

01:59.740 --> 02:05.100
and try this using workbox from Munich,

02:05.500 --> 02:07.460
hit post, save

02:07.510 --> 02:08.880
for syncing

02:09.250 --> 02:11.430
and let's now go back online

02:14.740 --> 02:16.500
and it's syncing that as you see.

02:16.690 --> 02:20.710
I also got the push notification which I can click to open the whole page,

02:20.710 --> 02:24.310
so that's also still working. In the database,

02:24.340 --> 02:28.840
we see this new post was added, from Munich, try this using workbox.

02:28.950 --> 02:32.530
If I reload the page, we see it here too.

02:32.590 --> 02:39.240
So the whole application is working fine but now using workbox combined with our own service worker.

02:39.870 --> 02:45.430
This also means we can get rid of all of our old service worker here, the sw.js file and I only use the new

02:45.430 --> 02:46.010
one

02:46.020 --> 02:47.670
where this is our own code,

02:47.680 --> 02:49.900
this is the automatically generated one,

02:49.930 --> 02:52.380
this is the helper script workbox needs

02:52.600 --> 02:57.020
and this is our command to generate the updated service worker.

02:57.070 --> 03:03.700
You need to run this whenever you change any of your normal files or of course if you change the service

03:03.700 --> 03:10.750
worker itself, your base file. Then you need to rerun this to make sure for it either to update the file

03:10.750 --> 03:11.370
manifest

03:11.410 --> 03:16.510
if you changed one of your other files so that it updates the precaching array or if you changed your own

03:16.510 --> 03:21.040
base of course to take that into account in the generated service worker.

03:21.040 --> 03:24.460
Now with that, let's see what else we can do in this project.
