WEBVTT

00:02.280 --> 00:07.530
In this module, I want to refresh your knowledge on the promise API and the fetch API.

00:07.820 --> 00:14.360
Both are native web technologies but not supported in all browsers which is why in this module, we'll also

00:14.350 --> 00:20.780
add polyfills to make sure we can use these techniques in older browsers too. In whichever browser,

00:20.780 --> 00:25.320
we thereafter use it, we'll practice how it works in this module.

00:25.370 --> 00:31.940
We'll have a look at how a promise works, what the fetch API is, how the fetch API compares to the traditional

00:31.940 --> 00:37.820
Ajax request and why all of that is needed when working with service workers and creating a progressive

00:37.820 --> 00:38.520
web app.

00:38.660 --> 00:40.210
Therefore after this module,

00:40.250 --> 00:43.220
we'll all be on the same page when it comes to these APIs

00:43.400 --> 00:46.840
and you're well prepared to use these tools throughout the course.
