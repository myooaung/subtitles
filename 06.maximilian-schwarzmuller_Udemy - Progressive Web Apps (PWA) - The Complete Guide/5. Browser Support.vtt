Here I am in our project and if we have a look at our running application in the browser, we see this

00:08.910 --> 00:13.680
is our application and in the menu, we got this enable notifications button.

00:13.690 --> 00:20.140
Now this is a key button because before we can start using notifications, we need to request permission

00:20.140 --> 00:21.000
to do so

00:21.340 --> 00:25.700
and once we got permission to do so, we can display notifications.

00:25.750 --> 00:32.050
So as a first step, I want to show you how to get access to notifications, how to get that permission,

00:32.800 --> 00:34.530
though as a very first step,

00:34.570 --> 00:36.690
let's check the browser support.

00:36.940 --> 00:43.300
Here's an article in the Mozilla Developer Network on the notification API and I've a link to this in

00:43.300 --> 00:50.470
the last lecture of this module of course, there if you scroll down all the way to the button, you will

00:50.860 --> 00:57.480
notice that there is a browser support table and browser support for the base notification feature

00:57.520 --> 00:59.350
is actually pretty decent,

00:59.350 --> 01:01.930
only Internet Explorer is not supporting it.

01:02.020 --> 01:09.070
Now browser support gets a bit worse if we have a look at how it is provided or supported in

01:09.070 --> 01:14.090
service workers. There are we have less support, though it's still okay

01:14.140 --> 01:19.950
and then we have different features we can configure for a given notification and there you also see that

01:19.970 --> 01:23.300
support is highly depending on the browser.

01:23.440 --> 01:26.520
Not all these options are supported, though

01:26.520 --> 01:32.170
the good thing is and you will see this in this module, if you use a feature which is not supported,

01:32.410 --> 01:35.250
it will fail without an issue, without an error.

01:35.260 --> 01:41.180
It will just not show notification that way but show it in a more basic form which is absolutely fine.

01:41.470 --> 01:43.970
On mobile, the support is also pretty decent,

01:44.080 --> 01:46.520
so we can definitely use notifications.

01:46.540 --> 01:53.350
Nonetheless I'll of course show you how to use them in a safe way by checking if the active browser does

01:53.350 --> 01:55.030
support notifications.

01:55.150 --> 02:00.040
With that, let's move on and let's ask for permission in the next lecture.
