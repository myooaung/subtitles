WEBVTT

00:02.540 --> 00:06.140
So in this module, our service worker again grew,

00:06.140 --> 00:09.620
however we added a lot of important functionality to it.

00:09.650 --> 00:13.530
You learned about all these different strategies and when to use them

00:13.760 --> 00:20.660
and with that, you've got a powerful toolbox of tools you can use in your web applications, to cache

00:20.720 --> 00:26.810
what you want to cache at the point of time you want to cache it and to serve it in the right way when

00:26.810 --> 00:33.770
being offline or in general as you never know, when not being sure whether your user is able to access

00:33.770 --> 00:35.950
your web page or not.

00:35.960 --> 00:43.190
Now this is a core set of features you gained in this module here and although we already practice them,

00:43.400 --> 00:47.400
I can only encourage you to keep on practicing these strategies.

00:47.450 --> 00:52.760
You have to understand them to pick the right one and implement it correctly on your page.

00:52.760 --> 00:54.790
Now with that, let's move on.
