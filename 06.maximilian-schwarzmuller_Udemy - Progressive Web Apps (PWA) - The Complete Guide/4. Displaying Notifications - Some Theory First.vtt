00:02.160 --> 00:04.610
So let's start with displaying notifications

00:04.620 --> 00:11.400
and first of all, I want to highlight that you don't need to listen to push event to display notifications,

00:11.400 --> 00:14.790
this is totally independent of push messages.

00:14.820 --> 00:17.960
You don't even need a service worker for that in theory, though

00:17.970 --> 00:24.240
I will show you how to use a service worker since oftentimes you use notifications in conjunction with

00:24.240 --> 00:26.700
service workers, especially with the push event.

00:26.880 --> 00:29.350
But technically, this is not required,

00:29.460 --> 00:34.310
you can display a notification whenever you want in your web application.

00:34.350 --> 00:37.480
So this is a key thing you have to keep in mind.

00:37.680 --> 00:44.430
We'll use the notification API then to create and show new notifications and I will show you not

00:44.430 --> 00:49.470
only how to create and show them but also how to configure them, how to configure how they look like

00:49.560 --> 00:50.910
and so on.

00:51.510 --> 00:59.340
Besides that, the notification API allows you to create notifications, set a title, a body, possibly images

00:59.460 --> 01:04.370
and more. Important I just mentioned it, you don't even need a service worker for that,

01:04.560 --> 01:11.400
you can use the notification API directly from your normal page Javascript, though you can also use it

01:11.400 --> 01:14.640
from service workers and I'll show you both approaches.

01:14.790 --> 01:22.290
We will lean towards the service worker approach because a) we have a service worker and b) as I mentioned,

01:22.560 --> 01:27.960
most of the time you use notifications in conjunction with service workers since you want to react to

01:27.960 --> 01:35.310
events and then show notification. Also important, notifications with service workers of course definitely

01:35.450 --> 01:42.070
are required when we want to listen to a push event because we can only listen to that in service workers

01:42.090 --> 01:44.960
and I will cover this later in the course too.

01:44.970 --> 01:50.440
Now with that, let's dive into notifications and how we can display them in our web app.
