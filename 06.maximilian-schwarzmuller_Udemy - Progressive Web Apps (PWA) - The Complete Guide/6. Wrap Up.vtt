I hope you enjoyed this module. It wasn't a very long one but I wanted to share how you can turn your next

00:08.670 --> 00:13.110
React, Angular or Vue app into a progressive web app.

00:13.300 --> 00:19.500
As you saw, it's super simple for React and Vue as they start as a progressive web app already and there,

00:19.510 --> 00:25.630
the only thing you have to do is hook into it and make sure that you add your service worker, maybe customize

00:25.630 --> 00:32.250
the configuration, maybe exchange for tool they use with workbox and that's all. For Angular,

00:32.260 --> 00:38.380
it was a bit more complicated but I'm very positive that this will also get better in the future.

00:38.470 --> 00:44.470
The Angular team will probably add more and more features to make that easier and especially the CLI team

00:44.740 --> 00:49.870
will probably move towards creating a progressive web app out of the box in the future too.

00:50.020 --> 00:56.840
Until then, you saw how to convert your Angular project into a progressive web app, as you saw,

00:56.890 --> 00:58.120
not that difficult too.
