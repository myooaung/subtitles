00:02.400 --> 00:09.920
So in this module, we learned how to cache dynamic content using indexedDB. You learned how to access

00:09.930 --> 00:16.380
indexedDB using that IDB wrapper so that we can use promises and you learned how this allows you

00:16.530 --> 00:22.830
to use service workers together with indexedDB to provide an offline functionality for dynamic content

00:22.850 --> 00:23.810
too.

00:23.970 --> 00:28.620
We can't yet send requests, send post requests when we're offline,

00:28.620 --> 00:30.850
we'll soon be able to do that too though

00:31.020 --> 00:37.350
but this already is a huge improvement and allows us to always show fresh data to the user, either from

00:37.350 --> 00:40.590
the cache if offline or from the server,

00:40.590 --> 00:43.620
this is preferred if we do have an internet connection.
