WEBVTT

00:02.100 --> 00:03.890
So we added a lot of options

00:03.960 --> 00:10.230
and in the last lecture, we added actions. Now actually, it would be nice if we could react to clicks on our

00:10.230 --> 00:15.250
notification, either on the notification itself or on one of our actions.

00:15.360 --> 00:18.870
We can do this but this happens in the service worker,

00:18.900 --> 00:26.100
why does it happen in the service worker, that's a core question. The answer is a notification,

00:26.110 --> 00:28.820
keep that in mind is a system feature,

00:28.870 --> 00:34.930
it's not displayed in our web application, it's not HTML or something like that, it's displayed by the

00:34.990 --> 00:36.640
operating system.

00:36.820 --> 00:41.530
Hence the user may interact with it when our page isn't even opened,

00:41.530 --> 00:43.060
infact this is something

00:43.060 --> 00:45.830
service workers are about, they run in the background

00:45.940 --> 00:51.310
and for example when using Chrome on Android, you will get notifications even if your application is

00:51.330 --> 00:53.490
closed, even if the browser is closed.

00:53.500 --> 00:57.970
This is why you have to interact with user actions on the notification

00:58.030 --> 01:02.770
in this background process which is always running, which is your service worker.

01:03.160 --> 01:07.830
So there at the very bottom of this file, after this sync event,

01:08.000 --> 01:10.670
I'll add a new event listener.

01:10.780 --> 01:14.260
I'll just make some space so that we have this code here in the middle.

01:14.260 --> 01:23.190
So here I'll add an event listener and I listen on a special event, the notification click event. Now notification

01:23.200 --> 01:29.560
click as you might guess is executed whenever the user clicks on some notification thrown by this service

01:29.560 --> 01:34.990
worker, which clearly is the case for our existing notification. In there,

01:35.020 --> 01:38.000
we can now get some information from that click.

01:38.050 --> 01:45.750
First of all we can find out which notification it was, so we can retrieve the notification by accessing

01:45.840 --> 01:54.130
event notification. Now we can also find out which action was clicked,

01:54.170 --> 01:57.360
so the action is event action.

01:57.380 --> 02:00.430
These are two useful pieces of information

02:00.710 --> 02:05.810
and first of all, we can simply log the notification here if we want, to see what's inside it.

02:06.230 --> 02:12.710
We can also check if the action is equal to confirm and keep in mind, confirm here,

02:12.740 --> 02:18.120
that is basically the idea I set up in app.js, here this action ID.

02:18.170 --> 02:23.150
So if this button is clicked, the action will be confirm in the service worker

02:23.150 --> 02:28.070
too, so this is what I'm retrieving, action simply is that ID I assigned.

02:28.100 --> 02:34.160
So if that's confirmed, we could console log confirm was chosen.

02:34.520 --> 02:40.010
We in this case maybe also want to close the notification, something which will happen automatically

02:40.010 --> 02:46.430
on some operating systems but on others, for example on Android, the notification stays in the top bar.

02:46.640 --> 02:52.940
So with notification close, notification is the notification we retrieved from the event, you can get

02:52.940 --> 02:55.100
rid of it because the user interacted with it,

02:55.160 --> 02:58.770
you probably want to get rid of the notification.

02:58.800 --> 03:04.260
Now let's say in the other case, that the notification wasn't confirm,

03:04.380 --> 03:10.130
for now I simply want to log the action to see what the action was.

03:10.350 --> 03:16.860
And later in this course, I will revisit this and show you how you can actually open a specific page

03:16.860 --> 03:22.050
in your application when the user clicks on a notification because that often times is what you want

03:22.050 --> 03:22.530
to do.

03:22.650 --> 03:27.540
You show a notification and the user currently doesn't even have the browser open, you want you open

03:27.540 --> 03:30.920
the browser for the user and navigate to one of your pages

03:31.020 --> 03:33.590
but again, more on this later.

03:33.720 --> 03:35.900
For now let's see how this works,

03:35.910 --> 03:37.390
notification click.

03:37.800 --> 03:38.730
So as always,

03:38.730 --> 03:46.440
let's head back to our application, go to application and clear the site data, reload the page and let's

03:46.440 --> 03:48.540
click on enable notifications.

03:48.620 --> 03:52.250
Now it's showing up on my different screen and you can't see it there

03:52.380 --> 03:54.270
but I will now click OK,

03:54.390 --> 03:56.030
watch the console log.

03:56.340 --> 03:57.170
You'll see

03:57.210 --> 03:58.820
confirm was chosen

03:58.890 --> 04:01.100
and you see the notification I output.

04:01.410 --> 04:03.840
Here you see some information about the notification,

04:03.840 --> 04:09.960
basically what we set up, the batch, the body, you'll see it also converted icon and batch to full

04:09.960 --> 04:10.790
URLs,

04:10.860 --> 04:11.560
that's what I meant,

04:11.580 --> 04:13.720
you could have passed them right from the start

04:13.980 --> 04:19.940
and you see basically the setup we used as well as the timestamp when this notification was sent.

04:20.400 --> 04:22.840
So that's very useful to find out

04:22.860 --> 04:26.740
and again you also see the action I chose was confirmed.

04:26.930 --> 04:33.300
Now if I click another action or the notification itself, you'll see in the case I click the notification

04:33.300 --> 04:37.050
itself, nothing is output because action isn't set in this case,

04:37.080 --> 04:40.360
I didn't pick an action, I just clicked on the notification itself.

04:40.800 --> 04:48.590
If I click the cancel notification action, you see cancel because we just output the action here.

04:48.630 --> 04:53.950
So that's how we can react to clicks on the notification or one of the actions,

04:54.100 --> 04:57.450
again more about this later. In the next lecture,

04:57.450 --> 05:03.960
I first want to dive into how we can actually listen to the notification getting closed, though before

05:03.960 --> 05:09.450
we do that, let's make sure we also close it manually here on a click in the else case

05:09.540 --> 05:11.790
and of course you could simply put this after the

05:11.820 --> 05:13.710
if else statement all together.

05:14.010 --> 05:19.920
But now let's move on to listening to notification closes and let's find out what a close actually is.
