00:02.110 --> 00:06.090
In the last lecture, we requested permission to send notifications,

00:06.090 --> 00:08.380
now I want to display one. For this,

00:08.400 --> 00:14.820
I'll add a new function which I'll name display confirm notification because I want to confirm that

00:14.820 --> 00:18.140
we've got permission. Now in there,

00:18.450 --> 00:24.000
I will use the simplest way of showing a notification to start with and we'll later show you how you use

00:24.000 --> 00:27.540
service workers and how you can configure your notification.

00:27.900 --> 00:31.140
So first of all, let's execute this method in our else block here

00:31.200 --> 00:39.900
once we got permission and to show a new notification, all we have to do is call new notification and

00:39.900 --> 00:47.310
then pass a title for the notification, like successfully subscribed, something like that.

00:47.370 --> 00:53.540
That's the most basic form and this will already show a notification on our machine

00:53.850 --> 00:59.580
and keep in mind, notification does not mean a Javascript alert or something like that,

00:59.700 --> 01:05.850
it will be a real system notification, really showing up like all other system notifications

01:05.880 --> 01:08.490
we may get on our device.

01:08.490 --> 01:10.250
Now let's see this in action.

01:10.290 --> 01:14.150
I'll go back to the application and again under the application,

01:14.190 --> 01:20.460
I'll clear the storage to quickly fetch my updated Javascript code, reload the page once to really fetch

01:20.460 --> 01:23.610
it and then click enable notifications again.

01:23.710 --> 01:27.430
Now I won't be asked for permission again because I already granted it

01:27.790 --> 01:29.640
but you see user choice granted

01:29.820 --> 01:33.710
and on a separate screen, I got this notification.

01:33.720 --> 01:41.370
Unfortunately, you can't show notifications on external monitors, which is why I can't show it here when

01:41.370 --> 01:48.650
recording since I'm recording on external monitor but I copied in a screenshot of what I saw on my other screen.

01:48.960 --> 01:50.950
So this is the notification we got

01:50.970 --> 01:56.140
and you should have gotten the same just by calling new notification.

01:56.220 --> 02:00.080
Now just new notification like this of course is a bit boring,

02:00.330 --> 02:03.040
so you can pass options to it.

02:03.150 --> 02:09.480
So I'll create a new Javascript variable, I'll name it options and it will be a Javascript object.

02:09.510 --> 02:14.370
Of course you could also directly pass it to new notification as a second argument,

02:14.370 --> 02:16.680
in this case I'll just pass the options variable,

02:16.680 --> 02:22.320
again you could of course start directly pass that object. Here there are various options you can set

02:22.470 --> 02:24.960
and I'll dive into them in the next lectures.

02:25.200 --> 02:31.020
One important option I want to show right away is the body option because right now as you could see

02:31.020 --> 02:37.020
on this screenshot on the notification you got, we only had a title, this title.

02:37.020 --> 02:42.660
Now if you also want to show more text than just a title, that would be the body and there we could say

02:42.780 --> 02:50.310
you've successfully subscribed to our notification service, something like that.

02:50.340 --> 02:56.520
Now this alone, setting up the body and passing this options object to the constructor will display

02:56.520 --> 03:02.610
more than just a title. Back in the application if I fetch the updated code by again clearing my data,

03:02.660 --> 03:08.530
my storage and reloading, if I now click this enable notifications button again,

03:08.700 --> 03:13.240
now I get a new notification on my other screen, this one

03:13.320 --> 03:17.250
and there you see I also got some text.

03:17.250 --> 03:23.330
So these are now my notifications in their most basic form. In the next lecture,

03:23.340 --> 03:27.700
I'll move on and show you how you show them by using the service worker,

03:27.870 --> 03:34.230
you can use the same options there and then I'll also dive into the other options you can set up to also

03:34.230 --> 03:36.520
show an image and stuff like that.
