00:02.200 --> 00:07.720
So now that we know which browsers support notifications, let's use them and let's first make sure that

00:07.810 --> 00:13.170
enable notifications does something and asked for permission.

00:13.410 --> 00:19.450
Now for that if we have a look at our index.html file in the public folder, you will notice that this

00:19.510 --> 00:27.760
enable notifications button exists twice - once here in this site drawer and once in the toolbar, depending

00:27.760 --> 00:34.900
on whether we're viewing our application on a mobile device or on the desktop. Both buttons have the

00:35.050 --> 00:37.900
enable notifications CSS class,

00:37.900 --> 00:43.260
so my goal is to select them by this class and then simply start working on them,

00:43.270 --> 00:49.830
add an event listener and ask for permission whenever they get clicked. I'll do this in the app.js

00:49.840 --> 00:55.900
file because this file gets imported in all my pages and use the same menu in the help

00:55.900 --> 00:57.340
index.html file,

00:57.430 --> 01:02.480
so by adding the code in app.js, I make sure that the button works there

01:02.490 --> 01:05.010
too. So let's move over to app.js

01:05.020 --> 01:08.300
and let's start working on it there.

01:08.320 --> 01:16.390
First of all, I'll add a new variable at the top and I'll name it enable notification, notifications buttons.

01:16.720 --> 01:22.930
Buttons because it's going to be an array and I'll use query selector all to select all elements

01:23.140 --> 01:30.790
which have this enable notification text or a CSS class, enable notifications

01:30.820 --> 01:32.290
it is with an s at the end.

01:32.380 --> 01:36.160
So this is the CSS class I want to use to select my elements.

01:36.190 --> 01:38.240
With that, I have access to all of them,

01:38.260 --> 01:44.800
now I want to make sure that I only show these buttons if notifications are supported by a given browser

01:45.220 --> 01:51.740
because if my browser doesn't support notifications, there is no need in showing that button.

01:51.850 --> 01:58.870
So what I'll do is in my CSS file, I'll by default turn them off in app.css which is also important

01:58.870 --> 02:05.520
in all pages, I'll turn it off by selecting enable notifications and setting display to none,

02:05.680 --> 02:09.460
so by default they are not shown. Now in app.js,

02:09.480 --> 02:10.800
I want to enable them,

02:10.810 --> 02:15.990
I want to show them if the browser does support notifications. For this,

02:16.030 --> 02:23.130
we can write an if statement to use if notification, that's the API name in window.

02:23.350 --> 02:31.300
If our window, so the currently opened window has a notification object, that means that the given browser

02:31.360 --> 02:38.110
supports notifications, so we can safely enable this button since we will be able to handle button clicks

02:38.470 --> 02:41.800
and we'll add button click listeners soon.

02:41.800 --> 02:48.400
So first of all, let me loop with a normal for loop through all these notification buttons,

02:48.400 --> 02:54.820
it's only two here but if I were to add more, that's a flexible approach of manipulating them all

02:54.820 --> 02:55.900
at once.

02:56.050 --> 03:01.880
So here I will simply create my for loop where I use i in a very traditional way

03:02.170 --> 03:04.660
and now I want to select my button

03:04.660 --> 03:13.750
in each iteration to do it for all buttons and set the style display to inline block here

03:13.810 --> 03:19.000
when we do support notifications. I also want to register a click listener,

03:19.180 --> 03:25.930
so I'll add an event listener to the given button on a click and there, I want to execute a function which

03:25.930 --> 03:29.770
I'll now create. I'll create a new function here and I'll name it

03:29.770 --> 03:38.540
askForNotificationPermission. This new function is the function I want to execute on a click,

03:38.570 --> 03:45.020
so I'll pass it here without parentheses, just a reference to this function and this function shall now

03:45.070 --> 03:46.680
request permission.

03:46.700 --> 03:48.660
We need to do this first,

03:48.800 --> 03:54.520
theoretically if we want to display a notification, the browser will automatically prompt the user

03:54.710 --> 03:59.080
but it's better if we do it manually which allows us to handle the user response

03:59.120 --> 04:01.990
and of course control when we in the end ask for it.

04:02.090 --> 04:07.930
In this case, we ask for it when the user actively click on this button, enable notifications,

04:08.030 --> 04:11.840
so the chance of him agreeing to give us this permission is pretty high,

04:11.960 --> 04:16.470
so that's a good place to manually trigger this trigger permission request.

04:16.610 --> 04:23.150
We do ask for it by reaching out to notification and we know that this object does exist in the window

04:23.150 --> 04:29.600
since this method can only get executed on a click on this button, which in turn is only displayed if

04:29.600 --> 04:31.120
notification exists,

04:31.160 --> 04:37.220
so this is safe. So on the notification object, we can execute request permission

04:37.220 --> 04:43.700
and as the name implies, request permission will show a prompt to the user asking him whether he wants to give

04:43.700 --> 04:48.120
us this permission to send or to display notifications or not.

04:48.440 --> 04:49.890
Here's an important thing,

04:50.180 --> 04:57.530
if you ask for notification permissions, you implicitly also get push permissions.

04:57.530 --> 05:00.770
Now as I mentioned, these are two separate technologies,

05:00.950 --> 05:04.000
notifications will be a simple box you display

05:04.200 --> 05:11.440
whilst push is simply the technique of pushing messages from a server to the browser vendor

05:11.450 --> 05:13.650
server to your web app

05:13.760 --> 05:21.560
and again, you get permissions for both if the user accepts notifications because both is strongly connected

05:21.590 --> 05:23.840
and serves the same purpose.

05:23.840 --> 05:31.070
So request permission is the function here and we pass a callback function to it where we get the result

05:31.100 --> 05:33.020
of the user choice.

05:33.050 --> 05:38.570
So here first of all I can output it, user choice and output the result

05:39.080 --> 05:45.190
and then I check if result is not equal to granted. Granted is one possible outcome

05:45.230 --> 05:50.330
and obviously we will get granted if the user did accept to give us this permission.

05:50.330 --> 05:59.930
So if it's not granted, then we know that we haven't gotten permission rights, no notification permission

06:00.080 --> 06:00.870
granted.

06:01.160 --> 06:03.340
That's too bad but nothing we can do here,

06:03.380 --> 06:05.330
if you user block permissions,

06:05.480 --> 06:11.940
we can't even ask again, if it's just undecided and close the tab or something like that,

06:11.960 --> 06:13.920
he'll get asked next time again

06:14.090 --> 06:20.870
but nothing more we can do, we try to pick the best possible point of time for asking. In the else case

06:20.870 --> 06:27.590
here though, we now can display a notification because there, we now have the permission.

06:27.630 --> 06:29.540
Now that's the next step I will do,

06:29.570 --> 06:37.010
I will show you how you can actively display a new notification directly from within your normal Javascript

06:37.010 --> 06:37.520
code.

06:37.610 --> 06:41.480
Before we implement that though, let's see if this works.

06:41.810 --> 06:48.800
So for that, you can either now bump up the version of your static cache in your service worker since

06:48.800 --> 06:54.180
you changed your normal Javascript code or during development to make this easy,

06:54.200 --> 06:57.230
you can go to your application, to the application tab,

06:57.260 --> 07:01.360
clear storage and clear the site data to empty everything.

07:01.460 --> 07:06.560
Once you then reload your app, not only does the new service worker get installed because you removed

07:06.560 --> 07:07.540
the old one,

07:07.550 --> 07:11.940
it also means that your new Javascript code is now active. If I open

07:11.960 --> 07:13.210
the console now

07:13.490 --> 07:19.530
and I open the side menu and click enable notifications, you'll see the prompt here at the top and there

07:19.560 --> 07:21.530
we can block or allow.

07:21.530 --> 07:25.280
Now if I click allow, you'll see user choice is granted,

07:25.280 --> 07:32.240
so now we do have access to notifications so we could display one in the future. To score

07:32.240 --> 07:33.600
some bonus points,

07:33.620 --> 07:37.580
you could now of course turn the button style to display

07:37.580 --> 07:38.570
none again.

07:38.690 --> 07:46.090
So in here where we do have the rights, you could now execute some code to hide the button.

07:46.100 --> 07:50.210
I'll leave it here though because I'll use it to show some notifications in the future

07:50.300 --> 07:52.160
but you could hide it.

07:52.160 --> 07:54.260
So with that, we got the code

07:54.260 --> 07:59.390
we need to ask for permission, in the next lecture,

07:59.420 --> 08:04.920
we will now actually display a new notification directly from our normal Javascript code.
