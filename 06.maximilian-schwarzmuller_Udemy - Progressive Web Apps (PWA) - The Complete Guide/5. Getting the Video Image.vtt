00:00.130 --> 00:05.780
In the last lecture, we created our own polyfill to handle browsers which kind of support accessing

00:05.780 --> 00:08.560
the camera but not through the modern API.

00:08.850 --> 00:14.280
From this point on after the second if statement, we can always call media devices get user media

00:14.300 --> 00:19.950
because it will either return this promise which rejects and gives us an error or a promise which indeed

00:19.950 --> 00:25.830
will access the user media and give us a result which is in line to the modern syntax.

00:26.250 --> 00:34.340
So with that, we can now safely access this, hence what we don't have to do is again check for media devices

00:34.350 --> 00:38.180
in a navigator because we know we can now safely access it.

00:38.310 --> 00:47.580
Therefore I can call navigator, media devices and media devices as you know has the get user media method,

00:47.850 --> 00:54.870
either natively or on older browsers or webkit Mozilla, this functionality which takes advantage of

00:54.930 --> 00:57.450
their custom implementations.

00:57.450 --> 00:59.710
Get user media takes an argument,

00:59.910 --> 01:06.110
the constraints and that argument has to be a Javascript object which has two properties.

01:06.180 --> 01:14.490
You don't have to pass them, you can only pass one, you can set video to true and you can set audio to true.

01:14.620 --> 01:21.640
Now if you don't want to audio, just pass video, this basically means give me access to the video and then

01:21.700 --> 01:25.590
it tries to find a way of giving you access to video on that device,

01:25.600 --> 01:32.440
most of the time by using the camera of that device. So with that, we get get user media to get

01:32.440 --> 01:34.230
access to the device camera,

01:34.450 --> 01:40.460
then we know get user media always returns a promise, even with our custom implementation,

01:40.780 --> 01:43.670
so then we can do something.

01:43.720 --> 01:47.740
This will be the case that we actually have access, that this succeeds.

01:47.980 --> 01:52.030
So here I get a function which gives me back a stream object,

01:52.030 --> 01:55.400
actually the video stream, it's already using my camera.

01:55.780 --> 02:03.150
One important thing, what about permissions? It will automatically ask me the first time I want to

02:03.150 --> 02:04.470
access the camera.

02:04.470 --> 02:06.320
So here when I call get user video,

02:06.360 --> 02:08.690
excuse me, get user media

02:08.730 --> 02:10.800
and I say that I want video access,

02:10.940 --> 02:14.940
it will have a look at if I already have permission to access the camera and if not, it will show a

02:14.940 --> 02:19.120
prompt to the user. If the user declines, we will not go to then

02:19.130 --> 02:20.030
but to catch,

02:20.070 --> 02:21.480
so it will throw an error,

02:21.810 --> 02:25.320
otherwise we do get access and in future usages,

02:25.410 --> 02:28.570
if we got permission, it will not ask again.

02:28.620 --> 02:30.700
So let's also handle a catch case here.

02:30.960 --> 02:36.870
Now here we get an error and we got various errors we could get. Now one error is that user declined to

02:36.870 --> 02:43.220
give us access, another error could be here, that we have a browser which just doesn't have a get user

02:43.220 --> 02:45.240
media method,

02:45.270 --> 02:46.620
not even his own one

02:46.950 --> 02:52.680
or maybe we are on a device which just doesn't have a camera, like a desktop PC. In all these cases

02:52.680 --> 02:53.350
here,

02:53.460 --> 02:57.640
we want to show the image picker instead.

02:57.660 --> 03:03.780
Now we got that image picker area here, an image picker area refers to that div surrounding the image

03:03.780 --> 03:04.990
picker.

03:05.100 --> 03:10.840
So we want to show this because by default, it's hidden and we want to show it if we know we're on a device

03:11.580 --> 03:13.680
where we don't have access to the camera.

03:13.920 --> 03:16.380
So pick image by default if

03:16.420 --> 03:21.000
we have a look at our CSS file, display is none.

03:21.010 --> 03:24.190
Here in the catch method, I actually want to show it.

03:24.240 --> 03:25.680
So the image picker area,

03:25.720 --> 03:28.830
I'll set the style, the display to block

03:28.830 --> 03:36.210
here to show that. Now the user has a chance of at least picking an image there and we'll see this in

03:36.210 --> 03:39.910
action in a second. In the then block,

03:39.960 --> 03:43.730
I of course want to get access to the camera itself though.

03:44.010 --> 03:49.490
So here, I now want to simply output that stream we got. For that,

03:49.500 --> 03:56.790
we'll use that video player because we got a video stream, a video element can display the stream. So I'll access

03:56.790 --> 04:04.050
the video player element and there we have a source object property and I'll bind this to the stream.

04:04.080 --> 04:11.350
This will then automatically play it because this player is set to be on auto-play which gives the

04:11.350 --> 04:17.620
nicest experience if you just want to show an ongoing image of the device camera.

04:17.640 --> 04:20.920
So with that, we got the video player set up,

04:21.030 --> 04:24.540
of course we also need to show it though because it's also hidden by default.

04:24.630 --> 04:30.390
If you check the feed.css, video and canvas both are display none.

04:30.450 --> 04:39.320
So here, I want to set video player, the style, the display to block. And now just to round it up,

04:39.360 --> 04:45.930
I want to make sure that whenever we close the modal, I set video player and and image picker to none again,

04:46.170 --> 04:49.700
to go back to that original starting state because I will enable it

04:49.700 --> 04:55.050
anyways once we do open the modal but just in case we close it and then remove access to the media,

04:55.320 --> 04:56.330
we don't show it

04:56.350 --> 05:03.820
the next time we open the modal. So we already initialize, we then open create, now in close,

05:03.900 --> 05:05.680
I just want to do cleanup work,

05:05.880 --> 05:14.400
image picker area, I'll set style display to none here and the same for the video player, here.

05:14.430 --> 05:20.490
I want to set the style, the display to none, to go back to the starting state.

05:21.150 --> 05:26.220
And I actually can already do this for the canvas here too even though we are not using it right now

05:26.400 --> 05:27.930
but so that I don't forget, 

05:27.960 --> 05:29.360
reset this too.

05:29.820 --> 05:32.400
Now with that all in place, let's see it in action

05:32.490 --> 05:38.460
and since we changed our Javascript code, let's go to the service worker, bump up that static cache version

05:39.090 --> 05:44.060
or give it any other name and then close that tab here.

05:44.100 --> 05:45.420
That was wrong by the way,

05:45.420 --> 05:46.710
first you need to refresh it,

05:46.710 --> 05:48.330
now we need to close it again.

05:48.480 --> 05:49.940
So we loaded it one more time,

05:49.980 --> 05:51.720
this installs the new worker,

05:51.840 --> 05:54.510
now we activate it by opening a new tab.

05:54.930 --> 05:56.550
Let's have a look at how this works,

05:56.560 --> 05:59.220
if we click the plus here, you'll see 

05:59.220 --> 06:00.110
that's me.

06:00.120 --> 06:04.920
Now what you didn't see is and I'm just watching basically not in the camera most of the time because

06:05.190 --> 06:07.130
I'm watching on my external monitor,

06:07.260 --> 06:13.570
now what you don't see is that we are asked for whether we want to give this access.

06:13.850 --> 06:15.180
So let me quickly click on this

06:15.220 --> 06:18.710
i here next to my address and there I can

06:18.730 --> 06:23.960
switch camera to use global default which is ask and I will do the same for location,

06:24.030 --> 06:26.400
it was turned on due to testing for me.

06:26.400 --> 06:28.080
Now I'll reload the page

06:28.080 --> 06:29.430
and now we will see if I click the plus

06:29.430 --> 06:32.280
now, we don't see a camera yet,

06:32.280 --> 06:34.120
I have to click allow or block.

06:34.190 --> 06:35.820
Well let me actually block this,

06:35.970 --> 06:37.290
now you see the image picker,

06:37.320 --> 06:38.420
that's our fallback,

06:38.460 --> 06:40.250
so that's working great.

06:40.260 --> 06:43.150
Now let me close this and reset this one more time,

06:43.200 --> 06:45.200
so camera to ask again.

06:45.480 --> 06:47.630
Now I need to reload the page again,

06:47.970 --> 06:48.820
let's try it again

06:48.840 --> 06:49.970
and allow it this time,

06:50.040 --> 06:51.830
now you see the the picture,

06:51.830 --> 06:53.590
so hello there.

06:53.640 --> 06:55.090
This is an image,

06:55.110 --> 06:55.990
this is nice

06:56.040 --> 06:57.460
I hope, so

06:57.580 --> 07:02.470
it's just a stream though, capturing, clicking that button doesn't do anything.

07:02.470 --> 07:05.520
So the next step is to actually make it work

07:05.770 --> 07:12.430
and we do that by obviously hooking up the button here and thereafter saving a snapshot of this

07:12.430 --> 07:12.890
image

07:12.910 --> 07:16.910
here right below or in place of that video player actually

07:16.930 --> 07:22.900
so that is this is the image we then later send to the back-end. So let me close that and see you in the next lecture

07:22.960 --> 07:25.330
when we actually make that capture button work.
