00:02.420 --> 00:07.880
Now that you learned more about promises and fetch in the last course module, in this course module, we'll

00:07.880 --> 00:12.380
again dive back into service workers, much deeper into them now though

00:12.380 --> 00:18.170
and by the end of this module, our service worker will have grown quite a bit as you can tell. Now the

00:18.170 --> 00:20.990
cool thing is that with that code,

00:21.140 --> 00:26.330
our application is now offline capable, at least in a basic form.

00:26.360 --> 00:30.800
You can see that if I take offline here and reload, it still works.

00:30.800 --> 00:31.660
That is what we'll have

00:31.670 --> 00:37.380
by the end of the application because if you try this right now before going through this module, all you

00:37.380 --> 00:40.010
see when going offline is this.

00:40.010 --> 00:41.540
Now we can certainly improve that.
