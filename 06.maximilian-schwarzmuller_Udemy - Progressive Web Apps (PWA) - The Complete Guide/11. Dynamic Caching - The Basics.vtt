Thus far in this module, we consider pre-caching,

00:05.830 --> 00:09.880
so we clearly defined which items we want to store in the cache

00:10.120 --> 00:15.680
and therefore if we wanted to fetch anything else from the cache, it just failed.

00:15.680 --> 00:18.970
You can also add items dynamically to the cache,

00:19.070 --> 00:24.080
maybe you don't want to pre-cache them because you don't want to bloat the cache right at the beginning

00:24.080 --> 00:31.070
during installation but you want to make sure that for example that thing with the icons which issue

00:31.070 --> 00:36.890
an extra HTTP request, that something like that works or that if the user visited a page, that he's

00:36.890 --> 00:42.920
able to visit again in the future because you fetched or stored the already fetched items. So in the end,

00:42.930 --> 00:46.200
you want to dynamically add items to the cache.

00:46.790 --> 00:54.140
So we still have our set up with index.html app.js file but anywhere in these files, you issue

00:54.140 --> 01:01.850
a fetch event either because some resource is fetched it through an import in the HTML file or you request something

01:01.850 --> 01:04.690
manually through a fetch event in the app.js

01:04.700 --> 01:05.380
file.

01:05.480 --> 01:12.620
In both cases, you maybe want to store that in your cache, so you access the cache, you then reach out to

01:12.620 --> 01:18.320
the network and fetch the resource and the fetched resource can then be stored in the cache since you

01:18.320 --> 01:19.360
got it anyways,

01:19.460 --> 01:20.550
the request was sent

01:20.550 --> 01:26.710
anyways, of course when you had internet connection. So dynamic caching here means that you dynamicall

01:26.840 --> 01:28.790
add items to the cache,

01:29.000 --> 01:34.710
not necessarily that you cache dynamic content like user created posts or something like that,

01:34.880 --> 01:38.980
I'll show you a special technique for such content later in the course.

01:38.990 --> 01:44.710
For now let's stick to assets like file, image files, script files and so on

01:44.710 --> 01:49.070
These however also can be added dynamically because you store them when you need them or when you

01:49.070 --> 01:50.060
got them.

01:50.060 --> 01:52.590
Let me show you how it works in our code.
