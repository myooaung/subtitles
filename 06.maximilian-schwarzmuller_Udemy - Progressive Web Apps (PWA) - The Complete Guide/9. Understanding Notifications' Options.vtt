00:02.070 --> 00:06.690
Over the last lectures, you learned how to display notifications and that's awesome,

00:06.690 --> 00:10.530
however now I want to dive deeper into the different options you can set up.

00:10.590 --> 00:16.880
Thus far we only show the body and the title which we passed as a first argument to show notification.

00:16.950 --> 00:23.250
These are two super useful things to have in a notification though because they are supported by all

00:23.250 --> 00:31.260
devices. Now I'm deliberately saying devices and not browser because the features you can display in

00:31.260 --> 00:38.620
a notification depend on the device you're displaying it on, not on the browser because keep in mind, notifications

00:38.650 --> 00:41.680
you show here do not show up in the browser,

00:41.790 --> 00:44.700
that's why I had to use this screenshot fallback,

00:45.030 --> 00:47.160
they are shown by your device,

00:47.160 --> 00:53.700
so in my case my MacBook, on a smartphone it would be your phone and therefore it's your phone or your computer

00:53.700 --> 00:57.970
deciding which things it can show in a system notification.

00:58.080 --> 01:01.080
Sometimes that's the only title and the body,

01:01.260 --> 01:07.290
sometimes you can display an image. So you can always add more to options but you can't rely on it being

01:07.290 --> 01:08.130
displayed.

01:08.370 --> 01:14.730
Definitely add it to enhance the user experience on devices where it is supported but be prepared that

01:14.730 --> 01:16.530
not all users might see it,

01:16.530 --> 01:20.730
so put your core content into the title and the body

01:21.210 --> 01:26.630
and with that, let's move on and let's start adding new options.

01:26.640 --> 01:32.250
One nice option we can add is an icon to display next to the notification.

01:32.250 --> 01:35.350
You simply add icon and then a path to the icon

01:35.520 --> 01:39.240
and this can be any valid URL pointing to an icon.

01:39.420 --> 01:46.290
Of course it works best if you point to an image which is nicely configured to be an icon, for example

01:46.290 --> 01:48.610
in our images folder under icons,

01:48.690 --> 01:53.770
we've got all these app icons which have equal width and height which is always great for icons,

01:53.880 --> 01:56.540
so they work very nicely as icons,

01:56.650 --> 02:00.750
also due to the resolution, they're not too big so quick to download,

02:00.780 --> 02:03.210
these are all things you should try to keep in mind.

02:03.450 --> 02:09.660
So here, I'll point to one of them by using an absolute URL here and you could use

02:09.660 --> 02:11.190
a URL with HTTP at the beginning

02:11.190 --> 02:16.800
too, now I will use slash something and this will automatically use the server on which the app is running.

02:16.800 --> 02:25.970
So here I want to point to /src/images/icons and then app-icon-, I'll use the 96x96

02:25.980 --> 02:26.690
icon

02:26.730 --> 02:31.870
since this has a relatively nice resolution to look good on various devices.

02:31.890 --> 02:36.830
We of course want the image which isn't too big, so that we don't have to load that much but we also

02:36.840 --> 02:39.200
want to ensure that it looks nice,

02:39.270 --> 02:43.190
so this is a nice size which you can orientate yourself on

02:43.410 --> 02:45.740
and with that, we should now see an icon.

02:45.750 --> 02:46.890
Let's try it out.

02:47.100 --> 02:53.910
Let's save this and go back to our application, as always I'm clearing existing data to quickly download

02:53.910 --> 02:59.280
my new Javascript code by reloading the page and then let me click this button.

02:59.310 --> 03:06.200
I see this notification on my other screen, so that is how we can display icons.

03:06.270 --> 03:11.750
Now we can do more than just display icons though, we can add more options to the setup,

03:11.910 --> 03:17.790
for example we can add a whole image. The difference to an icon is the icon is that thing showing up to the

03:17.790 --> 03:20.760
right or left, so next to the title somehow,

03:20.760 --> 03:27.780
image is also a part of the content of the notification and just as I said at the beginning, these options

03:27.780 --> 03:30.470
are not necessarily supported on all devices,

03:30.540 --> 03:36.570
for example the image is something we won't see here on Chrome for Mac or on Mac, I should say. We will

03:36.570 --> 03:39.460
see it later when I show it on my Android phone though.

03:39.660 --> 03:42.700
So an image can also be added just like we added an icon,

03:42.720 --> 03:46.050
we pass a URL or a path to the image,

03:46.050 --> 03:49.030
in this case I want to show the /src/images

03:49.150 --> 03:50.840
sf-boat.jpg

03:50.900 --> 03:53.000
file as an image.

03:53.160 --> 03:56.410
So that's the image I want to display inside of that notification

03:56.580 --> 03:59.440
and I can add it by adding this option.

04:00.480 --> 04:00.830
Now

04:00.840 --> 04:07.620
besides the image, we can also set up the direction of the text, default is left to right,

04:07.650 --> 04:14.610
you could set it to right to left to add some extra information to your notification for screen readers

04:14.640 --> 04:15.470
and so on.

04:15.570 --> 04:16.830
Now I'll leave the default,

04:16.860 --> 04:19.300
just wanted to introduce that option.

04:19.410 --> 04:21.390
Lang is another option you can set up

04:21.390 --> 04:28.860
to be clear about the language you're using and here you have to use a bcp47 compliant language

04:28.860 --> 04:29.520
code,

04:29.550 --> 04:32.800
for example EN-US, you might know this,

04:32.910 --> 04:34.800
so it has to be bcp47,

04:34.800 --> 04:36.610
simply google that to be sure

04:36.660 --> 04:41.340
which language tags or IDs you can use and which not

04:41.480 --> 04:48.500
and with that, with these two options, you give some extra metadata information about your notification.

04:48.510 --> 04:55.480
Now another thing you can set up which is partially supported on some of devices is vibrate.

04:55.480 --> 05:01.320
Now this allows you to specify your own vibration pattern for this notification to be clear about how

05:01.320 --> 05:03.020
it should vibrate.

05:03.370 --> 05:10.410
So here you could say it should vibrate for 100 milliseconds, pause for 50 and vibrate again for 200

05:10.410 --> 05:10.970
maybe

05:11.180 --> 05:16.180
and this is how you structure this pattern, vibration, pause, vibration, pause and so on.

05:16.290 --> 05:19.860
Again not every device may support this but if it supports it,

05:19.980 --> 05:23.410
this is nice to give your notification a custom touch.

05:23.400 --> 05:28.890
Now there's one other option I want to show you right now before I dive deeper into more important other

05:28.890 --> 05:30.550
options in seperate lectures

05:30.660 --> 05:37.550
and that's the batch option. Batch is what's showing up in the notification bar on let's say Android

05:37.550 --> 05:37.880
mainly,

05:37.990 --> 05:41.300
I guess Android is the only the device where we have that.

05:41.460 --> 05:47.580
If you think about notifications on Android, you have to add top toolbar where you see basically black

05:47.580 --> 05:51.700
and white icons of the application which did notify you, right?

05:52.170 --> 05:59.280
And there you can set up your own batch to give your own app, your own icon showing up in that top bar.

05:59.280 --> 06:03.630
The cool thing is you can pass a normal icon, you don't have to create a black and white one

06:03.630 --> 06:06.430
and Android will automatically mask it for you.

06:06.480 --> 06:14.530
So here I could also point to my images icons folder and then maybe also this app icon, 96x96.png

06:14.610 --> 06:18.960
file and that's actually the recommended resolution by Android by Google

06:19.230 --> 06:23.970
and again it will automatically mask it for you and then display it there.

06:23.970 --> 06:26.430
These are the options I want to show you for now,

06:26.430 --> 06:32.710
now before we continue, I will show you how this looks on a real device,

06:32.760 --> 06:38.970
so let me quickly plug that in and then show you how notifications can look like on the real phone. To

06:38.970 --> 06:46.150
connect my phone as shown before, in the developer tools I'll go to more tools and remote devices, there I see pending

06:46.180 --> 06:52.080
authorisation, so on my phone I have to allow USB debugging here for this and now I have my

06:52.080 --> 06:57.930
one plus connected. Put forwarding is still turned on so that I can conveniently access the application

06:57.930 --> 07:06.000
running on my Mac from my phone and now if I click on my phone here, I can open new tabs here or open them

07:06.030 --> 07:07.510
on my phone and click inspect,

07:07.520 --> 07:09.740
I'll quickly do it on my phone here.

07:09.810 --> 07:16.870
So here you see the connected tab now and now I can now click inspect here, open this up on a new screen

07:17.480 --> 07:23.820
and this is now as you are used to it, my phone running or the developer tools running on my

07:23.820 --> 07:26.610
phone connected to my phone basically.

07:26.730 --> 07:33.240
Now there, I'll first of all make sure that I clear any existing set up, so I'll set side settings, clear and

07:33.240 --> 07:39.400
reset here and now I want to reload this page to just make sure I'm really starting fresh.

07:39.400 --> 07:43.130
Now let me click this enable notifications button on my phone

07:43.990 --> 07:51.160
and there as you can see, I'm now prompted to give this access, so I'll click allow here and now you can

07:51.160 --> 07:53.020
see, in the top toolbar,

07:53.020 --> 07:59.470
there are three icons, one is from the recording software and one from USB debugging, the left one is

07:59.470 --> 08:04.870
actually the camera icon of our application. If I expand this,

08:04.870 --> 08:07.030
you also see the text, the content,

08:07.210 --> 08:11.730
you see the icon and you see the image I specified,

08:11.950 --> 08:15.480
what you didn't see is the vibration pattern which also worked.

08:15.520 --> 08:17.460
So this is my own notification,

08:17.530 --> 08:19.450
tapping it doesn't do anything right now,

08:19.480 --> 08:21.580
we'll cover this later in the course too

08:21.760 --> 08:25.150
but this shows you how it looks like here on a real device

08:25.210 --> 08:27.920
and of course that's different to how it looks like on the Mac

08:28.090 --> 08:33.020
but that's natural and this shows that even on a Mac, I didn't get any errors, here

08:33.040 --> 08:34.390
I never got errors,

08:34.390 --> 08:37.690
it just doesn't use the features it can't support.

08:37.720 --> 08:41.310
So that's how notifications look like on a real device in the end.

08:41.440 --> 08:43.720
Now let's dive deeper into other options

08:43.720 --> 08:47.660
we can also set up before we then dive into push messages.
