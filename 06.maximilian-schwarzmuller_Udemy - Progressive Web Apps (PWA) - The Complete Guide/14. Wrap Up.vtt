00:02.070 --> 00:07.140
I hope you enjoyed this module. You learned a lot about the manifest, the different properties you can

00:07.170 --> 00:11.640
add to this manifest and how to test it on a mobile device emulator.

00:11.640 --> 00:17.940
Now in the next course module, we'll add the other important building block of a progressive web app, a

00:17.940 --> 00:23.460
service worker which will then even unlock new features related to the manifest.

00:23.460 --> 00:25.100
Can't wait to dive into this,

00:25.110 --> 00:26.280
so let's move on.
