00:02.300 --> 00:09.210
In the last course module, we added something super important, push notifications. Something priorly only

00:09.210 --> 00:11.160
available to native mobile apps,

00:11.160 --> 00:13.040
now available in web apps too,

00:13.080 --> 00:14.580
that's just amazing.

00:14.580 --> 00:20.130
Now let's continue this road and let's see which other native device features we can use in our progressive

00:20.130 --> 00:20.780
web app.

00:21.120 --> 00:28.930
In this module, we'll enhance our application by adding access to the device camera and also to the location.

00:28.980 --> 00:35.070
You'll see that we have to request permissions to access both but once we did that, we can of course

00:35.260 --> 00:39.230
access it, take the camera to take an image and upload that onto the server.

00:39.300 --> 00:42.730
Well, that's exactly what we're going to do in this module.

00:42.780 --> 00:49.380
By doing that and by adding that, you again have another powerful way of enhancing your applications

00:49.620 --> 00:53.490
and getting closer to this native mobile app-like feeling and behavior.
