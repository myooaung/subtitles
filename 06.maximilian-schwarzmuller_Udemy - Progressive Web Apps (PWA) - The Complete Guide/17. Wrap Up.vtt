00:02.560 --> 00:08.530
In this module, we used workbox to enhance our application, this time from a developer perspective.

00:08.720 --> 00:13.900
It doesn't add any new feature which would require different levels of browsers support but it helps

00:13.900 --> 00:19.280
us as a developer to really leverage the power a service worker can offer us.

00:19.460 --> 00:25.610
It makes it easy for us to parse different incoming requests and apply different strategies or as you

00:25.610 --> 00:27.620
learned, our own handler.

00:27.860 --> 00:34.960
You also saw that together with minification, we could really build a powerful and fast web application

00:35.210 --> 00:41.190
and the audit confirmed it, 100 points in progressive web app, that's just amazing

00:41.360 --> 00:47.090
and with that you see that what we built in this course really is powerful and that you learned a

00:47.090 --> 00:49.350
lot of very useful features here.

00:49.490 --> 00:54.290
Now the features taught in this module specifically are something you might want to consider in your

00:54.290 --> 00:55.650
next project too

00:55.970 --> 01:01.540
and even though we use the workbox-cli, I mentioned how you could integrate it into Gulp or webpack

01:01.550 --> 01:02.360
workflows,

01:02.470 --> 01:05.820
the configuration and usage is always the same.

01:06.170 --> 01:07.830
So with that, let's move on

01:07.880 --> 01:08.600
in this course.
