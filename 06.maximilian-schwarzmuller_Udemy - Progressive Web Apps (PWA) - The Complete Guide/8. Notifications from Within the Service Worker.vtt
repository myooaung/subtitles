In the last lectures, we started displaying notifications and this is using the notification API in the

00:07.730 --> 00:09.350
normal browser window.

00:09.350 --> 00:10.800
Nothing wrong with that

00:11.040 --> 00:18.080
but oftentimes, you actually display notifications through a service worker and actually, you can always use

00:18.080 --> 00:20.490
a service worker if your browser supports it

00:20.750 --> 00:26.750
and since we need it anyways for push messages, I'll switch to a service worker here. The options we

00:26.750 --> 00:29.650
can pass to the notification will be the same.

00:29.660 --> 00:37.180
So what I'll do is, I will first of all check if service worker is supported in the given navigator,

00:37.220 --> 00:44.680
so if the user browser has this feature. If it doesn't have it, well then we can't display a notification

00:44.900 --> 00:47.510
and you could fallback to that syntax,

00:47.630 --> 00:52.910
of course that only makes sense for a normal notification here because if we later start using push,

00:53.060 --> 00:54.730
we need service workers anyways,

00:54.860 --> 00:55.670
so I will

00:55.690 --> 00:57.970
right switch to them. Now

00:58.010 --> 01:01.050
to display a notification through the service worker,

01:01.310 --> 01:06.240
we simply access our navigator and there, the service worker object

01:06.470 --> 01:10.400
and then I want to get access to the active service worker registration.

01:10.430 --> 01:17.180
We do this by simply calling ready here, ready just checks if the service worker is ready and then

01:17.180 --> 01:18.970
returns a promise.

01:18.980 --> 01:26.570
Now in this promise, we get access to the current service worker registration,

01:26.690 --> 01:33.410
that basically means the service worker currently managing our page and once it's ready, we get the service

01:33.410 --> 01:36.640
worker registration, so I'll call it swreg.

01:36.950 --> 01:43.370
This basically is our active service worker, though the registration is basically the service worker

01:43.450 --> 01:48.980
plus so to say because the service worker itself is of course managed in the sw.js

01:48.980 --> 01:52.400
file by accessing the whole registration,

01:52.430 --> 01:59.180
we can not only listen to incoming events but we can also do more, for example show notifications,

01:59.180 --> 02:06.650
that is one of the features the service worker registration supports. On the service worker registration,

02:06.650 --> 02:09.860
we can call show notification.

02:09.900 --> 02:16.400
This is simply this service worker interface to notifications and the constructor here, the method to

02:16.400 --> 02:20.120
be precise, takes the same arguments as this notification,

02:20.120 --> 02:24.410
so we pass a title and the options. So I'll pass it here 

02:24.470 --> 02:26.790
and of course I'll pass my options object

02:26.810 --> 02:31.340
also inside the if block because we only need it if we do support service workers,

02:31.360 --> 02:35.840
I won't show a notification otherwise and I will get rid of this new notification code here at the

02:35.840 --> 02:37.130
bottom.

02:37.130 --> 02:38.720
So now just with this changed,

02:38.720 --> 02:40.190
let's see if it works.

02:40.310 --> 02:41.610
I'll save this

02:41.750 --> 02:49.070
and one step I want to do before we see this, I'll add from sw in my title to really see if it's coming from

02:49.070 --> 02:51.560
there or if we just somehow run the old code.

02:51.710 --> 02:56.390
So now I'll save it and now back in the application, let's go to the application, clear storage and

02:56.390 --> 03:01.370
clear the site data to clean up everything and reload the fetch the new code

03:01.600 --> 03:06.680
and now let me click that button and you see on the different screen here in my case but of course

03:06.680 --> 03:13.190
screenshot as always, that I get the same notification as before but this time with from service worker

03:13.220 --> 03:13.850
added.

03:13.880 --> 03:18.900
Now with that, we got a way of displaying a notification directly from within the service worker,

03:18.920 --> 03:24.950
this will become more important later too when we actually start receiving push messages.

03:24.950 --> 03:31.390
Now with that, let's dive deeper into the options and see what else we can configure about this notification.
