00:02.210 --> 00:05.120
In this module, we added push notifications

00:05.140 --> 00:08.720
and with that, you get a powerful way of re-engaging your users.

00:08.860 --> 00:12.670
You learned what it takes to display a notification, not that much

00:12.870 --> 00:17.280
and to send a push message and that these are totally different things.

00:17.530 --> 00:22.710
You learned that it takes quite some effort to make sure that not anyone can send messages to your users

00:22.810 --> 00:24.240
but of course that it's doable.

00:24.340 --> 00:29.480
We implemented a fully functional push service using our own server hosted by Firebase

00:29.770 --> 00:35.770
and you saw how you can then trigger a push message, send it to the browser vendor service and

00:35.770 --> 00:37.970
then deliver it to your browser.

00:38.050 --> 00:43.420
And with that, we got a fully functional push server set up including a notification which then gets

00:43.420 --> 00:46.260
displayed in the end once the message reaches the browser.

00:46.510 --> 00:51.010
You also learned how the user may then interact with that message and how you control what happens if

00:51.010 --> 00:52.750
the user taps it.

00:52.750 --> 00:58.330
These were all core things and definitely things worth using in your next application.

00:58.330 --> 01:05.090
It might still need some practice to not forget one of the steps, to get the security thing right

01:05.260 --> 01:09.850
but in the end, it's always the same procedure and something you can quickly pick up and use.

01:09.940 --> 01:11.570
Definitely consider using it,

01:11.590 --> 01:14.330
it can really drive user engagement with your app.
