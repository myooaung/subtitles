00:02.150 --> 00:07.460
So let's improve the solution of hardcoding this URL in there and let's start on our server

00:07.460 --> 00:11.960
side code. There we pass a payload to send notification,

00:11.960 --> 00:18.540
the second argument and right now, that's a Javascript object which has a title and a content property,

00:18.560 --> 00:20.790
that's what we're passing. Now I'll

00:20.900 --> 00:24.440
add a third one, you can give this any name you want, I'll name it

00:24.470 --> 00:28.370
open URL because that should be the URL which should get opened.

00:28.400 --> 00:34.690
Now the cool thing is this can now be the URL you really want to guide the user to, can be

00:34.740 --> 00:37.990
a full URL, HTTP something,

00:38.170 --> 00:40.150
https of course works too

00:40.230 --> 00:47.190
or one which only works or which will then navigate to this absolute path on your server.

00:47.510 --> 00:50.900
So here, I could go to /help to open the help page

00:50.900 --> 00:52.800
whenever we click the notification.

00:52.850 --> 00:58.070
Now this is my URL and I'm pushing this with a push notification.

00:58.070 --> 01:00.390
Now this is the server side code,

01:00.560 --> 01:06.550
so before we do anything else, let's run Firebase deploy again to upload this updated code.

01:06.560 --> 01:08.150
We don't need to do anything else,

01:08.180 --> 01:09.880
that's all we needed to change,

01:09.890 --> 01:15.470
pass more data to the front-end. So this will keep on running and I continue working in the service worker

01:15.470 --> 01:18.570
now. Here in the push listener,

01:18.800 --> 01:21.340
that's where we'll get this data, right?

01:21.350 --> 01:25.990
First of all for the fallback, I'll also set up a let's maybe name it

01:26.000 --> 01:33.260
URL here and this could be slash, just slash to open the root page, so that we can really see

01:33.320 --> 01:37.090
that we're not using this because if /help opens later,

01:37.100 --> 01:39.280
it's not this URL.

01:39.290 --> 01:46.610
So here we extract the data and now we can also pass this to our notification with a special option

01:46.610 --> 01:51.140
I haven't introduced yet, the data option, that's important.

01:51.260 --> 01:56.360
The data option is a useful option to pass, you guessed it, some extra metadata,

01:56.570 --> 02:03.320
data you can later use upon interaction with your notification to the notification and you could pass

02:03.410 --> 02:06.330
any data you want, as many properties as you want.

02:06.320 --> 02:14.020
Here I want to pass a URL property and of course that URL property will be data.URL, with

02:14.030 --> 02:14.410
data

02:14.420 --> 02:19.490
now referring to my variable where I will have a URL property. Though in the data we get back

02:19.490 --> 02:20.870
from the server, it's open

02:20.870 --> 02:25.630
URL so therefore of course this little mistake, we need to change it here too,

02:25.760 --> 02:31.090
so that should be open URL in the fallback too, so the same name as in the server

02:31.100 --> 02:36.230
because here we are trying to directly access it from the data we get from the server and then we map it

02:36.290 --> 02:42.350
to a URL property in this object we pass to data to our notification.

02:42.350 --> 02:45.920
Now in the notification click listener, we can now extract that data,

02:45.920 --> 02:48.370
that's the cool thing about passing data with it.

02:48.710 --> 02:55.870
So here in notification click, we can access data on this extracted notification, the notification

02:55.880 --> 03:03.530
we extracted from the event and therefore here where we navigate or where we open a new page, depending

03:03.530 --> 03:04.840
on what we should do,

03:05.060 --> 03:12.680
we can access notification.data, this is the special property we just set up and then it's open URL

03:12.680 --> 03:19.940
in our case. So .data accesses this data thing and there we have a URL property actually,

03:19.970 --> 03:20.940
so excuse me,

03:20.960 --> 03:21.740
it should be

03:21.920 --> 03:24.890
URL, the property we set up here

03:26.140 --> 03:30.630
and that should now use the data we pass from the server to the front-end.

03:30.850 --> 03:32.860
Now the deploy process is finished,

03:32.920 --> 03:40.390
therefore let's save this and we updated the service worker, so I'll reload the page, close it and reopen

03:40.390 --> 03:49.020
the tab to make sure you don't unregister the old one and now let's send a new push with custom URL

03:49.030 --> 03:55.940
hopefully. Let's send post and I get my notification,

03:56.100 --> 04:01.860
if I click on it, you see I go to the help page and that clearly proves that it works because the only

04:01.860 --> 04:08.190
way we could get there is if we use our server side code because that's the only place where we point

04:08.220 --> 04:09.190
to that.

04:09.630 --> 04:15.720
So this is now working, we're now passing data from the server with the push message to the client.

04:15.720 --> 04:17.170
We're using that to dynamically

04:17.190 --> 04:23.640
open a different URL and that's all the power you probably need to really work with push messages

04:23.730 --> 04:26.090
and enhance your application with them.
