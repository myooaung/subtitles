WEBVTT

00:02.370 --> 00:08.490
Thus far, we already had a look at what progressive web apps are, why we might want to use progressive

00:08.490 --> 00:10.280
web apps or build them

00:10.350 --> 00:16.950
and what we're going to build in this course. Now I want to have a look at the core building blocks, technologies

00:17.040 --> 00:23.310
we use when building progress of web apps because thus far, we only had some buzzwords. We heard about

00:23.310 --> 00:26.430
offline access and push notifications

00:26.430 --> 00:32.040
but let's now really have a look at all the features we use and you'll learn about in this course when

00:32.040 --> 00:33.820
building progressive web apps.

00:34.070 --> 00:41.070
A core feature are service workers. Service workers are supported in modern browsers like Chrome and

00:41.070 --> 00:45.350
service workers are basically Javascript running in a background process,

00:45.420 --> 00:51.300
even if your application is closed. Service workers are a core building block because they allow us to

00:51.300 --> 00:57.270
get offline access, to cache some files and serve them if we don't have internet connection and they

00:57.270 --> 01:01.330
also give us access to other progressive web app related features

01:01.470 --> 01:06.890
for example background synchronization, sending a request once internet connection is re-established,

01:07.020 --> 01:11.350
we use service workers for that. Push notifications would be another example,

01:11.370 --> 01:16.500
we use service workers for that because they are running in the background independent of currently

01:16.500 --> 01:23.880
opened tabs. Service workers therefore are the core building block and I have a couple of modules

01:23.880 --> 01:30.150
diving into all the different things you do with them, also advanced lectures, advanced modules, you'll

01:30.150 --> 01:32.970
learn a ton about them in this course.

01:33.120 --> 01:39.110
Service workers are not the only building block, whilst we can use them for offline access, background

01:39.120 --> 01:41.420
synchronization, web push and more,

01:41.460 --> 01:45.180
the application manifest is also an important building block.

01:45.180 --> 01:50.220
You're going to learn about this in the next course module already, the application manifest makes your

01:50.220 --> 01:56.790
application installable on home screens, not installed through App Store but instead, well you will see

01:56.790 --> 02:03.570
it, you can basically install a web app and it then will do more than just open that webpage. A web manifest

02:03.570 --> 02:09.480
is therefore super important and another feature you typically use or you use in any progressive web

02:09.480 --> 02:10.740
app you are building

02:11.220 --> 02:13.610
and then you can add more and more features.

02:13.620 --> 02:19.220
Now besides the technology we use, responsive design is another core building block.

02:19.310 --> 02:24.860
Now to be honest, I won't dive too much into it in this course because there already are whole courses

02:24.860 --> 02:31.010
covering this out there and responsive design is something we're doing since a couple of years already.

02:31.230 --> 02:35.890
So therefore, definitely make sure you know this and I will touch on it in this course

02:36.030 --> 02:41.630
but I will focus on all the new technologies, all the things which aren't covered that well in the internet

02:41.640 --> 02:49.590
yet. Now and then, there are other things like the geolocation API or the camera API, so that we can access

02:49.590 --> 02:51.380
various native device features

02:51.540 --> 02:54.120
and I will dive into that in this course too.

02:54.480 --> 02:57.000
These are the core building blocks, in the end

02:57.000 --> 03:03.810
always keep in mind progressive web app is just a term, it in its closest definition refers to an app which

03:03.810 --> 03:10.320
uses service workers and has application manifest but it typically also means applications which are

03:10.320 --> 03:16.530
responsive, which offer background sync, which uses web push and more and you're going to learn all that

03:16.640 --> 03:17.740
in that course.
