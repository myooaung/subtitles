00:02.130 --> 00:06.660
So let's dive into caching dynamic content with indexedDB

00:06.900 --> 00:15.150
and before I explain what indexedDB is and I also explain what the difference between caching dynamic

00:15.150 --> 00:23.100
content and dynamic caching is, let's make sure we have some dynamic content in our application because

00:23.220 --> 00:30.750
thus far if we have a look at our application and there at the feed.js file, yes we do reach out to

00:30.750 --> 00:31.880
the web here

00:31.910 --> 00:37.150
with this fetch call here where we post data right now, previously we got data with a get request

00:37.620 --> 00:40.190
but this is only a dummy request in the end,

00:40.230 --> 00:42.510
we're not using this data.

00:42.660 --> 00:44.240
Now we could build up on that

00:44.260 --> 00:45.520
but that's really boring,

00:45.520 --> 00:51.540
instead I want to reach the next level in this application and sooner or later, we're going to need a

00:51.540 --> 00:54.110
simple server where we can store data.

00:54.300 --> 00:59.850
We'll start setting up such a back-end in the next lecture so that we have a resource, a server we can

00:59.850 --> 01:01.500
query for data.

01:01.620 --> 01:07.680
Whilst we won't be able to post data to it just yet, we will at least have a real data source.

01:07.710 --> 01:10.430
So let's start building that in the next lecture.
