In this module, we had a look at some native device features we can access from the browser, the camera

00:08.590 --> 00:12.800
or the media API in general and the location of the user.

00:13.090 --> 00:19.160
You saw that it isn't that difficult, taking the image, the screenshot was the most difficult part actually

00:19.300 --> 00:26.050
but even that was doable. With that, your toolbox grew and you can get even closer to a real native mobile

00:26.110 --> 00:27.190
application.

00:27.190 --> 00:32.500
Just keep in mind to always provide fallbacks as I show you in this course because you can't rely

00:32.500 --> 00:39.520
on your user using a browser and/or device where you can access these features but if you can,

00:39.530 --> 00:43.970
boy you are really close to a real native application then.

00:44.140 --> 00:45.160
Let's continue.
