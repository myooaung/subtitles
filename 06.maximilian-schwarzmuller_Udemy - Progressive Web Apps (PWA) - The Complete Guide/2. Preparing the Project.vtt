WEBVTT

00:02.100 --> 00:06.190
Let's dive into native device features and how we can use them in our web app.

00:06.300 --> 00:12.930
Previously, these features were basically only available in native applications, which means built with

00:12.930 --> 00:18.120
Swift or Objective C for iOS or Android for well, Android,

00:18.150 --> 00:21.080
now we can also access some of them through the web.

00:21.270 --> 00:23.100
Of course always in a progressive way,

00:23.130 --> 00:27.820
so not all browsers support this but you will learn how to do that progressively

00:28.050 --> 00:28.490
and with that,

00:28.500 --> 00:34.680
why don't we go to our application which is all about sharing posts, moments, pictures with other people

00:35.070 --> 00:42.270
and add camera access to take a selfie and add the geolocation to find out where we actually are.

00:42.420 --> 00:48.460
Let's do this and let's start by preparing our project for that. To move on with our project and access

00:48.480 --> 00:52.890
the camera, get the location, we need more tools.

00:52.980 --> 00:57.840
Right now, if we go to the feed page and we create a new post, we can only enter title and location,

00:57.840 --> 01:00.450
there is no button to take a picture,

01:00.450 --> 01:05.590
there is no button to get the location. Now attached to this video here,

01:05.640 --> 01:11.190
you will find some code you can enter and I'll now add it together with you so that we add everything

01:11.190 --> 01:13.100
to the place it should go.

01:13.110 --> 01:18.540
The first piece of code we're going to add is something we add to our index.html file in the public

01:18.540 --> 01:19.370
folder.

01:19.650 --> 01:25.840
There we have this modal we're basically opening and there, we have the title input and the location input.

01:25.910 --> 01:30.560
Now above the form element here, I want you to enter this video,

01:30.660 --> 01:34.030
this canvas and this button element.

01:34.230 --> 01:37.940
Now video and canvas will later be used to take a picture,

01:37.950 --> 01:40.000
I of course will show you how this works

01:40.170 --> 01:43.980
and the button here simply is used to well, take the picture then.

01:43.990 --> 01:47.910
Now that's one part, to also support

01:47.910 --> 01:49.930
backward compatibility,

01:50.040 --> 01:53.960
I also want to add a file picker though.

01:53.980 --> 02:01.230
Now this is used to present a file picker for devices which don't have a camera or browsers which don't

02:01.230 --> 02:03.070
support using the camera,

02:03.360 --> 02:09.600
so we'll of course add some code to either show this file picker here where we can pick an image or to

02:09.600 --> 02:14.620
show this part at the top here where we can take an image using the device camera.

02:14.970 --> 02:22.080
The last bit of code we're going to add after but video, canvas, button and the pick image part here is below

02:22.080 --> 02:28.950
the location div here, so below this div holding the location input, I'll add another div which also has this

02:29.040 --> 02:30.750
input section class

02:30.900 --> 02:35.540
and there we have a button to get the location and also a loader,

02:35.550 --> 02:40.170
so a spinner we can display whilst we're fetching the location to indicate that we're doing something.

02:40.950 --> 02:48.330
Now if we save it like this and go back to our application, we of course would have to clear the site

02:48.330 --> 02:49.950
data to reload our code

02:49.950 --> 02:56.160
since we changed our HTML code which is cached and if we do so, we would destroy the subscriptions we set

02:56.160 --> 02:56.810
up, right?

02:57.000 --> 02:58.640
So we'll do it old school,

02:58.650 --> 03:01.850
go to the service worker and bump up our static cache

03:01.850 --> 03:08.910
version. This allows us to then simply reload the page to install the new service worker, then close the

03:08.910 --> 03:13.490
tab and open it again as you know it, to activate this new service worker.

03:13.500 --> 03:15.320
With that, we cached our new files and

03:15.330 --> 03:22.560
now if I open this, you see this doesn't look too great. Now no worries, we'll enhance this. The white space you see

03:22.560 --> 03:27.500
at the top here is basically this video and canvas element which we're not feeding with any device data

03:27.540 --> 03:28.540
yet,

03:28.560 --> 03:30.380
then you see the file picker here,

03:30.390 --> 03:33.180
the cool thing is here you can pick it, pick an image,

03:33.240 --> 03:38.520
now we'll later hide this if we have camera access and you see the spinner and the get location button

03:38.520 --> 03:40.380
which of course doesn't do anything.

03:40.680 --> 03:44.660
But we also see that the general set up is working,

03:44.820 --> 03:51.330
you also see that we can't click this exit button because it's off screen. Now that won't matter here because

03:51.510 --> 03:53.870
we're showing way too much stuff here

03:54.030 --> 04:00.960
in the end. If we want to fix it though which we probably should, we can go to feed.css and there, it's

04:00.960 --> 04:01.350
related

04:01.350 --> 04:10.170
to this create post set up. If we set top to zero here and not 256 pixels, it fits our minimum height of

04:10.170 --> 04:10.740
100vh,

04:10.740 --> 04:15.630
so taking the full space and it will only start to scroll if we exceed that.

04:15.870 --> 04:21.630
So now with that if we go back to the service worker and bump the static version up to 26,

04:21.630 --> 04:22.820
same game as before,

04:22.830 --> 04:28.950
reload the page, then open it in a new tab again to not delete your service worker,

04:28.970 --> 04:35.050
now we'll see that this works and we can scroll all the way to the bottom to see this.

04:35.050 --> 04:37.650
Now this is one possible solution,

04:37.650 --> 04:42.360
you see it's now below this top bar and we can close this easily.

04:42.390 --> 04:50.280
An alternative solution to this would be to set the minimum height, to calculate it from the maximum height

04:50.570 --> 04:58.320
of our screen minus 56 pixels which is just the height of our top bar and then position

04:58.350 --> 05:02.140
it 56 pixels from the top so we get the best of both worlds.

05:02.220 --> 05:08.760
The content of the modal fits fully on the screen and we still make sure we don't push parts of that

05:08.760 --> 05:10.830
modal below the top bar.

05:10.830 --> 05:12.930
So let's update the service worker file

05:12.930 --> 05:18.190
one final time and I'm just showing this to make sure that we have a nice looking application here.

05:18.360 --> 05:20.330
So let's reload this one more time

05:20.520 --> 05:25.140
and now we should see that if I open this modal, we still can scroll all the way to the top

05:25.170 --> 05:28.140
but in the end, all the content fits on there even though this is white,

05:28.170 --> 05:30.050
we got no overlapping here.

05:30.180 --> 05:33.670
Now we're not done though, we're showing stuff we don't want to show here,

05:33.840 --> 05:35.760
so we need to add more

05:35.760 --> 05:36.660
code.

05:36.660 --> 05:42.840
First of all, I'll go to the feed.css file and add some code here, regarding the canvas and

05:42.930 --> 05:46.290
the video and that code is attached too.

05:46.470 --> 05:54.360
So here I add create post video and canvas, this simply styles the video and canvas elements to fit nicely

05:54.360 --> 05:59.200
on the page screen and to well, basically look nice there.

05:59.520 --> 06:04.020
I'll also add another style, create post pick image.

06:04.050 --> 06:09.690
This hides this image picker by default because we only want to show it manually later on if we are

06:09.690 --> 06:15.270
on the device where we don't have access to the camera because we don't have a camera or because the browser

06:15.270 --> 06:23.790
doesn't support it and I'll add this create post capture button styling which will style this capture button

06:23.790 --> 06:25.920
below the camera. Here

06:25.950 --> 06:31.850
the goal simply is to position it nicely by giving it a top and bottom margin and then centering it.

06:32.040 --> 06:39.980
Finally I want to add code regarding the spinner of this library and this will just center it nicely. With

06:39.980 --> 06:43.900
that, we should have all the code we need to style this,

06:43.970 --> 06:47.690
now we won't see that big of a difference here if we reload it

06:47.750 --> 06:50.580
and keep in mind, you need to bump up that version number.

06:50.750 --> 06:57.920
So let's do this one final time here, let's save this, reload and then close and open this. We won't see

06:57.920 --> 07:02.420
that much of a difference though because we're still not controlling that we can access the camera or

07:02.420 --> 07:03.560
anything like that.

07:03.590 --> 07:07.880
You do see though that we're hiding the canvas and video by default,

07:07.940 --> 07:12.930
I will show it once we do have access to the camera and that's all for now.

07:13.010 --> 07:17.930
So this is the starting state with which we'll start, in the next lecture we'll actually start writing

07:17.930 --> 07:21.180
code in Javascript to access the camera,

07:21.200 --> 07:27.060
show a live picture of our camera in this modal and eventually, take a screenshot.
