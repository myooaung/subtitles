WEBVTT

00:02.180 --> 00:07.600
We get offline functionality and our app seems to work fine but we get some issues,

00:07.820 --> 00:10.340
let's start with some errors we're getting.

00:10.340 --> 00:12.950
You'll see we have 79 errors here,

00:12.950 --> 00:14.350
you might have less or more

00:14.540 --> 00:18.640
but if we have a look at them, we see they're all related to fetch.

00:18.890 --> 00:24.200
We also got errors here in the console where we can't load some Chrome extension,

00:24.210 --> 00:29.750
now you might not have that, this clearly is coming from some Chrome extension and you can simply ignore

00:29.760 --> 00:30.860
this here,

00:30.860 --> 00:33.850
it's not related to the web app here.

00:33.890 --> 00:36.910
Now in the application tab, all these fetch errors,

00:37.130 --> 00:43.370
well they're simply coming from the fact that when we try to make a network request there, we of course

00:43.370 --> 00:45.700
return it from our cache

00:46.190 --> 00:49.050
but our fetch event itself,

00:49.130 --> 00:55.110
so when we tried to fetch it from the network, failed. We can easily handle these,

00:55.130 --> 00:59.170
let's go to our fetch request here

01:00.050 --> 01:06.770
and let's add a catch block to handle any errors and there, I'll simply do nothing.

01:07.060 --> 01:08.900
Now let me save this,

01:09.020 --> 01:16.460
turn on or turn off offline mode and reload this, clear the errors here, skip waiting, load the new service

01:16.460 --> 01:17.800
worker,

01:17.930 --> 01:20.770
we only get the Chrome extension error here now.

01:20.780 --> 01:26.630
Now if I go back to offline mode and reload here, we get this an unknown error occurred when fetching

01:26.630 --> 01:27.420
the script error

01:27.420 --> 01:30.300
too and this is stemming from our app.js

01:30.320 --> 01:34.240
file. Here when we registered a service worker, here,

01:34.430 --> 01:39.140
we of course try to fetch that and the service itself isn't cached,

01:39.200 --> 01:41.870
so therefore this does not work.

01:41.870 --> 01:46.040
Now caching the service worker doesn't make sense because it wouldn't do it anyways, it wouldn't fetch

01:46.040 --> 01:51.140
it from the cache and it's good that it wouldn't do that because we would enter an infinite loop where

01:51.140 --> 01:56.020
we could never update our application because we would constantly fetch an old version of the service

01:56.030 --> 01:57.290
worker from the cache

01:57.350 --> 01:59.060
even though we might have a new one.

01:59.240 --> 02:00.700
So therefore this is good,

02:00.710 --> 02:01.700
it's not working

02:01.730 --> 02:03.530
but this is where this error is coming from,

02:03.530 --> 02:05.230
we can ignore it.

02:05.300 --> 02:09.410
These are the error messages, we get more subtle issues in this app too though.

02:09.410 --> 02:11.690
Let's have a look at these in the next lecture.
