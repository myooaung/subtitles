In the last lecture, you learned about how to manage caches with different versions and how to update

00:07.940 --> 00:08.910
the sw.js

00:08.990 --> 00:11.990
file, let's now optimize this.

00:11.990 --> 00:17.900
Instead of repeating ourselves and having to edit this name manually which of course is error prone,

00:18.500 --> 00:25.850
we can simply add some variable at the top. I'll name it cache static and I simply use uppercase characters

00:25.850 --> 00:30.000
here to indicate that this is like a constant which I won't change,

00:30.020 --> 00:34.820
so cache static name maybe, of course name this whatever you like

00:34.820 --> 00:42.680
and here, I would simply name is static-v4 which will be the next version I use.

00:42.690 --> 00:48.970
Of course, you could also go with cache static version and then combine the name with static-version

00:49.050 --> 00:50.750
variable, whatever you like,

00:50.760 --> 00:51.930
I'll go with this approach.

00:52.110 --> 00:59.860
I'll do the same for the dynamic one, cache dynamic name will be dynamic-v2 actually here

01:00.030 --> 01:02.420
and of course you're free to choose any name you like here,

01:02.430 --> 01:08.400
just make sure to bump this version here whenever you make changes to any of your asset files, not if

01:08.400 --> 01:10.060
you change your service worker by the way,

01:10.200 --> 01:12.310
then it will install the new version anyways,

01:12.420 --> 01:16.390
just if you change anything about your assets you cache.

01:16.860 --> 01:18.780
So now we need to use these variables

01:18.780 --> 01:26.170
of course, I want to use them here when I open the static cache, I'll use cache static name and down

01:26.200 --> 01:26.690
there

01:26.700 --> 01:30.220
when I clean up the cache. There I want to remove everything

01:30.290 --> 01:35.940
but the currently up-to-date static name. The same for dynamic name,

01:36.240 --> 01:42.660
let's use it here in the clean up code and also down there where we open the cache to store our dynamic

01:42.660 --> 01:44.040
content.

01:44.040 --> 01:45.360
Now let's see if that works, if I

01:45.380 --> 01:47.710
go back to the application and reload,

01:47.730 --> 01:49.900
we installed a new service worker,

01:49.950 --> 01:55.010
now let's activate it too by reloading the tab

01:55.230 --> 01:59.120
and you should see that if you visit application, inspect your cache,

01:59.160 --> 02:02.230
you only have dynamic-v2 and static-v4,

02:02.490 --> 02:08.060
so the versions we set up here and the old versions were cleaned, were deleted.

02:08.130 --> 02:10.140
You even see it here in the console,

02:10.170 --> 02:12.590
removing removing.

02:13.260 --> 02:19.710
So this is how we manage the cache versions and how we make sure that we always load the latest asset versions

02:20.130 --> 02:25.800
and that we don't overpopulate our cache storage by removing unused caches.

02:25.920 --> 02:34.920
Time to practice that before we then move on and dive deeper into various patterns for fetching data, being

02:34.920 --> 02:40.120
more flexible about when we use the cache, when we reach out to the network and so on.
