00:02.240 --> 00:07.040
In the last lecture, we registered a service worker, a quick word about that registration before we dive

00:07.360 --> 00:13.670
deeper into the service worker file. The register method here also takes a second argument which is a Javascript

00:13.700 --> 00:14.790
object.

00:14.900 --> 00:21.710
There you can pass a scope property which takes a string where you can also restrict the scope,

00:21.980 --> 00:28.370
so here I could set this to /help/ to make sure the service worker only controls pages in

00:28.370 --> 00:29.600
the help folder.

00:29.870 --> 00:34.390
Now normally, it would control everything in the public folder because that is where the file lives

00:34.700 --> 00:36.730
but we can override this with the scope.

00:37.040 --> 00:41.130
You can't do it the other way around though, if you register the service worker in help

00:41.330 --> 00:43.580
and you want to set scope to slash,

00:43.760 --> 00:44.770
that won't work.

00:45.020 --> 00:49.790
I find it important to add this, though most of the time you'll just place the service worker where you want

00:49.790 --> 00:50.450
to use it

00:50.450 --> 00:53.420
but it's important to know this option.

00:53.450 --> 01:00.340
It's also important to understand that service workers and the manifest.json file are not related.

01:00.650 --> 01:08.540
Yes, there is this condition of the Chrome browser requiring a service worker to show you this app install

01:08.570 --> 01:12.550
banner which also requires a manifest.json file

01:12.710 --> 01:16.190
but in general you can use either of the two features independent of the other

01:16.250 --> 01:21.330
if you don't want to have this automatic app installed banner at least, that's important too

01:21.470 --> 01:30.530
and also important, service workers only work on pages served via https. Now correctly you would say, this

01:30.530 --> 01:31.760
page is not using https,

01:31.880 --> 01:33.680
it clearly isn't here,

01:33.740 --> 01:36.760
if you inspect it here, this is not secure.

01:37.010 --> 01:43.650
Localhost actually is an exception to enable you or to make development easier for you

01:43.650 --> 01:49.490
basically, this is the only exception though. If you want to deploy this on a real server, you need to

01:49.490 --> 01:54.760
serve your application through https otherwise it will not work,

01:54.770 --> 01:55.550
this is important.

01:55.610 --> 01:58.990
Service workers only work on https,

01:59.050 --> 02:00.170
why?

02:00.170 --> 02:03.480
Because service workers have a lot of power,

02:03.500 --> 02:09.620
you can accept any request, you want to make sure that this is served on a secure host and not on any

02:09.620 --> 02:13.880
host, you want to make sure it's encrypted and that this power isn't abused,

02:13.920 --> 02:15.510
hence this requirement.

02:15.500 --> 02:21.770
Now we know this extra thing with the scope and requirements for using service workers, let's dive into

02:21.770 --> 02:23.800
the service worker file here.

02:23.870 --> 02:26.670
Right now it's empty but we're changing this now.

02:27.110 --> 02:29.840
As I said in one of the last lectures,

02:29.840 --> 02:35.080
service workers are running in the background and are all about handling events.

02:35.330 --> 02:40.430
Now therefore, we always attach event listeners to the service worker,

02:40.550 --> 02:47.040
we simply react to events. We do this by first of all referring to the service worker with the self keyword,

02:47.060 --> 02:54.350
this basically means well please give me access to the service worker, to this background process and

02:54.350 --> 02:57.270
there, we can execute add event listener,

02:57.320 --> 03:04.590
you'll see this a lot. This is the same code you know from normal Javascript, here

03:04.610 --> 03:09.000
however you got access to separate or to special events.

03:09.140 --> 03:13.370
You don't have access to click or anything like that, to the normal DOM events,

03:13.370 --> 03:14.510
you don't have access there

03:14.540 --> 03:16.620
because do you know why?

03:16.830 --> 03:23.510
Because you don't have DOM access in the service worker but you have access to a special set of events,

03:23.510 --> 03:29.910
the ones I outlined on a slide earlier, for example the install event which will be fired when the browser

03:29.980 --> 03:33.460
installs the service worker. There

03:33.630 --> 03:36.820
we execute a function, we'll get an event object,

03:36.830 --> 03:39.950
this is passed into the function automatically by the browser

03:40.200 --> 03:44.320
and this object gives us information about this installation event.

03:44.730 --> 03:47.700
For now, I simply want to log something to the console,

03:48.340 --> 03:54.330
I'll log service worker and I'll just add this prefix between the square brackets to make it easier to

03:54.330 --> 03:58.210
see which log is coming from the service worker and which is not

03:58.430 --> 04:07.240
and there I'll say installing service worker... and also log the event.

04:07.250 --> 04:09.110
Now this is the install event

04:09.110 --> 04:14.780
and as I said, this is fired whenever a new service is, well installed.

04:14.840 --> 04:19.010
Now I'll copy this and add another event here,

04:19.010 --> 04:26.700
the activate event. This is fired whenever a service worker is not just installed but also activated

04:26.870 --> 04:30.190
and you'll see the difference in a second. Here

04:30.350 --> 04:36.040
I will say activating service worker and also log the event.

04:36.050 --> 04:40.060
There's also another line we have to add here to make sure that it works without issues,

04:40.070 --> 04:41.510
we have to return something,

04:41.780 --> 04:46.700
we should return self clients claim, claim is a method call.

04:46.700 --> 04:48.290
Now this certainly looks strange,

04:48.290 --> 04:55.670
it basically ensures that the service workers are loaded or are activated correctly. It should work without

04:55.670 --> 04:56.470
that line

04:56.660 --> 04:59.730
but it can fail from time to time or behave strangely,

04:59.930 --> 05:06.410
adding this line simply makes it more robust, might not be needed in the future but it is needed right

05:06.440 --> 05:09.460
now. With these two lines added,

05:09.620 --> 05:13.010
let's go back to our application and reload the page.

05:13.010 --> 05:17.750
Now we see service worker registered and we see installing service worker.

05:17.750 --> 05:23.860
We don't see the activate event though and this is actually the to-be-expected behavior

05:23.930 --> 05:26.420
and this now is a crucial thing

05:26.420 --> 05:32.150
you have to understand. It's so crucial I'll put it into a new lecture so that everyone sees it because if

05:32.150 --> 05:35.450
you don't understand this, you'll be in a world of pain

05:35.510 --> 05:37.640
during developing with service workers.
