00:02.060 --> 00:06.940
To conclude this module, I want to have a look at something we can find in the HTML files,

00:06.990 --> 00:11.510
so in both of them, the root index.html file and the one in the help folder.

00:11.880 --> 00:18.840
We had a look at responsive images, media queries to adjust the layout and also animations to have a nice

00:18.840 --> 00:20.580
looking application.

00:20.580 --> 00:25.650
Now there is one thing in the head section I also want to outline, besides all our icons here and so

00:25.650 --> 00:26.320
on,

00:26.350 --> 00:30.340
there's this meta tag here where we set the viewport.

00:30.350 --> 00:38.040
Now here I actually use a relatively default set up where I set the width to the device width and then I also set

00:38.040 --> 00:40.830
something which is not seen in every application.

00:41.010 --> 00:47.940
Now by sitting width equal to device width, we ensure that we actually scale this application correctly

00:47.950 --> 00:53.850
to the different device widths, so that you don't get the look of opening a desktop page on a mobile device

00:53.910 --> 00:59.430
but instead that we enforce the mobile device boundaries to the application and hence enter the responsive

00:59.430 --> 01:04.950
mode we configured with media queries and so on. The users scalable set up here makes sure that the

01:04.950 --> 01:08.230
user can't pinch and zoom in our application.

01:08.340 --> 01:13.500
Now you can discuss this controversially because you kind of make your application a little bit less

01:13.590 --> 01:21.090
accessible because people can't zoom in, on the other hand, you really get a mobile app-like feeling if you

01:21.090 --> 01:24.440
have like application where you can't zoom out and in.

01:24.720 --> 01:30.540
So you can go either direction, you can support zooming in and out, here I basically fix this so that

01:30.540 --> 01:35.700
you can pinch and zoom. Feel free to set this to whatever you need in your application,

01:35.700 --> 01:39.590
in our application there shouldn't be an accessibility issue with that

01:39.780 --> 01:41.720
but I can also see an argument against that

01:41.760 --> 01:44.820
and I wanted to highlight it here at the end of this module.
