WEBVTT

00:02.270 --> 00:07.130
Now here I'm again connected to my real mobile device, inspecting the screen and you can see it here

00:07.130 --> 00:08.120
too.

00:08.120 --> 00:10.630
Now we need to get the latest version of the service worker there

00:10.630 --> 00:14.110
too, so I'll reload, close that tab

00:15.030 --> 00:16.520
and re-open it.

00:18.190 --> 00:22.890
Now I'm connected again with the new service worker activated, old caches were removed as you

00:22.890 --> 00:24.190
can see

00:24.210 --> 00:26.010
and now let's try here too. If I click

00:26.010 --> 00:31.680
the plus, I'm asked whether I want to add it as a progressive web app, yes sure let's do that.

00:32.390 --> 00:36.420
I should also be asked whether I want to give access to the camera,

00:36.630 --> 00:37.760
yes allow that.

00:37.800 --> 00:39.390
So hey here you can see me,

00:39.390 --> 00:42.560
that's really awesome, I can see myself in so many places here.

00:42.660 --> 00:48.080
So now I can of course try to take a nice picture here, then enter something as a title

00:48.120 --> 00:57.450
and of course fetch location which was super fast and hit post and now, I get my notification here with

00:57.450 --> 01:02.990
which I can open the help page if I tap it since we set it up like this to get access to that.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.910
This shows that this also works on the mobile device of course

01:06.030 --> 01:11.580
and now we really got an amazing progressive web app with offline access for both getting and sending

01:11.580 --> 01:15.660
data using native device features and much more

01:15.780 --> 01:21.240
and you hopefully get a good impression of how you dig into that, where you can look deeper, where you

01:21.240 --> 01:27.600
can have a look at for example watching the user position instead of getting the active one

01:27.630 --> 01:29.300
and of course, we're not done yet.

01:29.460 --> 01:35.100
We'll have a look at how we can manage all the code we already have here, implement service workers

01:35.160 --> 01:40.600
in a way where we manage stuff about them automatically and additional cool things.

01:40.830 --> 01:41.580
Let's continue.
