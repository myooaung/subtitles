00:02.290 --> 00:06.920
So in this course module, we had a look at the core features of responsive design

00:07.000 --> 00:10.720
and as I mentioned at the beginning, you can and should dive much deeper.

00:10.720 --> 00:12.460
It's not the focus of this course,

00:12.490 --> 00:13.990
therefore the basics covered

00:13.990 --> 00:15.840
here are all we need.

00:15.880 --> 00:18.620
The course project is very responsive,

00:18.700 --> 00:22.120
so we've got something to work with which just works.

00:22.120 --> 00:28.360
Definitely spend the time in dedicated courses to make sure you get responsive design set and use

00:28.390 --> 00:34.750
all the tools and features you can use when it comes to optimizing your layout, your images and so on.

00:34.780 --> 00:35.950
And with that let's move on and

00:35.950 --> 00:43.180
let's go back into the technical area of progressive web apps and let's see which features we can add

00:43.240 --> 00:44.510
to our application.
