WEBVTT

00:02.580 --> 00:08.830
So let's dive into the meat of this course, into the core technologies that make up a progressive web app

00:08.930 --> 00:11.900
and we're going to start with one of the most important ones,

00:11.970 --> 00:15.890
the web app manifest which is just one single file

00:15.900 --> 00:17.340
you add to your project,

00:17.340 --> 00:23.360
we will have done this by the end of the course, where you can pass some extra information to the browser.

00:23.490 --> 00:29.380
Now the browser can take this information to display some things about your application differently

00:29.610 --> 00:35.070
and as you will later in the course learn, the browser depending on which operating system it's running

00:35.070 --> 00:35.400
on

00:35.460 --> 00:40.020
can even allow your app to install itself on the home screen of your user.

00:40.020 --> 00:44.880
That of course is where you want to get, sitting right next to all these native apps which had to be

00:44.880 --> 00:46.470
installed through the App Store,

00:46.470 --> 00:49.360
your app can be installed right from the web.

00:49.380 --> 00:54.810
With the help of the manifest and in this core section here, we're going to learn what makes up such

00:54.810 --> 01:00.850
a manifest, how we add it, how we configure it and how we can see its effect on a mobile device.
