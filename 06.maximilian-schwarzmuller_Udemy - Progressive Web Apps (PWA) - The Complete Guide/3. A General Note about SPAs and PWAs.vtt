WEBVTT

00:02.080 --> 00:07.900
In the last video, we had a look at how we turn our React created with create react app into a progressive

00:07.900 --> 00:08.590
web app,

00:08.650 --> 00:11.520
actually that it is one out of the box.

00:11.560 --> 00:17.040
Now what is if you don't use create react app but your own workflow?

00:17.380 --> 00:22.120
Well then we're back to the last module where I showed you how to use workbox and where I also hinted

00:22.120 --> 00:26.200
you towards the webpack plugin if you're using that which you probably do.

00:26.500 --> 00:32.340
So this again then just means you use the features you learned in the course, you use the workbox plugin

00:32.340 --> 00:34.940
if you want to to automate some things.

00:35.080 --> 00:36.930
You add a manifest.json file,

00:36.970 --> 00:40.480
you add a service worker, you add whichever logic you want,

00:40.600 --> 00:47.610
background synchronization, caching, dynamic caching, whichever strategy you want, this code doesn't change.

00:47.860 --> 00:50.190
And then you just implement it into your workflow,

00:50.200 --> 00:56.140
for example through this webpack plugin or simply by not using it in your workflow and just importing

00:56.140 --> 01:01.660
your handwritten service worker file in your index.html file which you probably have in any single

01:01.660 --> 01:03.070
page application.

01:03.070 --> 01:06.490
Simply import it there, write Javascript code which registers it

01:06.640 --> 01:07.960
and you're done.

01:08.000 --> 01:13.930
So this is what I really want you to take away, the things you learned here can be applied to any project

01:14.410 --> 01:18.680
and you saw some examples specifically targeting React

01:18.850 --> 01:25.180
but in the end, it's more of which workflow do you use question, the features you use and how you use

01:25.180 --> 01:26.730
them stays the same.
