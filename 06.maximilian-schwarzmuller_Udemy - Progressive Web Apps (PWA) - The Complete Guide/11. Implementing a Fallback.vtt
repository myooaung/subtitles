In the last lecture, we successfully tested our upload and hey, it's working.

00:06.540 --> 00:13.980
There's one thing I want to make sure we also have implemented though and that is our fallback. In

00:13.980 --> 00:16.780
feed.js under initialize media,

00:17.070 --> 00:20.480
if we fail, we show our image picker.

00:20.710 --> 00:24.770
Yes, showing it is nice but we definitely have to do something with it,

00:24.900 --> 00:29.350
otherwise people can click it, can pick an image and then nothing happens.

00:29.760 --> 00:36.090
So what I'll do is, below my capture button where we take an image from the camera, I'll reach out to

00:36.090 --> 00:37.480
my image picker,

00:37.480 --> 00:41.500
so to this variable where we get access to the image picker input element itself

00:42.680 --> 00:45.340
and there I want to add an event listener.

00:45.590 --> 00:51.140
I want to listen to the change event which is fired whenever a user changes the file, picks a new image

00:51.160 --> 00:52.320
basically.

00:52.610 --> 00:56.790
So here I then of course want to use that,

00:57.130 --> 01:01.170
so here I will simply set picture equal to event target files,

01:01.180 --> 01:02.560
that's a list of files.

01:02.560 --> 01:05.180
Now our picker will only accept one,

01:05.290 --> 01:09.620
so we can simply add or use the first element in this array.

01:09.850 --> 01:13.150
This gives us access to whatever the user picked

01:13.360 --> 01:15.330
and we will then upload that.

01:15.340 --> 01:17.650
Now let's see if that also works.

01:17.650 --> 01:23.860
So since I change the feed.js, let me bump up that static version number here,

01:24.660 --> 01:28.610
let's reload our page to install the new service worker

01:28.680 --> 01:32.920
and let's open it in a new tab and close the old one to activate it

01:33.300 --> 01:42.750
and now let's try it and I will disable camera access or simply ask for it, so that I now can block

01:42.750 --> 01:47.800
it and pick an image instead and I'll take that boat again.

01:47.820 --> 01:49.220
Now let's see

01:49.380 --> 01:59.370
boat from Munich again and let's see if we can upload this too. Got a push notification, let's reload the page,

01:59.810 --> 02:00.670
here we go.

02:00.890 --> 02:03.980
So this is also working and that's of course important.

02:04.280 --> 02:08.440
I will disable or enable camera access again here,

02:09.630 --> 02:12.490
so I will allow camera access for the future

02:12.560 --> 02:15.360
but of course I wanted to check whether this works or not

02:15.440 --> 02:21.360
so that we have a fallback working on older browsers or on devices which simply don't have a camera.

02:21.380 --> 02:28.010
Now with that fallback implemented, now it's time to move on to add geolocation and fetch that user location

02:28.010 --> 02:28.590
with it.
