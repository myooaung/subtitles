00:02.320 --> 00:08.050
In the last lecture I showed you that we have a valid set up to show this install banner to the user

00:08.310 --> 00:14.400
but I also mentioned that maybe you don't want to show it as early as possible. This assumption here

00:14.400 --> 00:20.530
of Chrome, that this is a good point of time is of course just like almost a random guess,

00:20.580 --> 00:27.690
of course some thought went into this because if a person revisits your page, they probably like it but

00:27.720 --> 00:29.150
you might know better.

00:29.250 --> 00:36.360
For example in our web application, maybe the chance for a user to actually accept the installation prompt

00:36.780 --> 00:40.970
is much higher once he clicked this plus icon here to add a new post,

00:41.280 --> 00:47.580
maybe this enhances our chance, so maybe we want to show the banner at this point of time.

00:47.580 --> 00:55.160
Now we can only show it if these criteria here are met but we can prevent Chrome from showing it after

00:55.160 --> 00:58.830
this criteria here and show it at a later point of time,

00:58.830 --> 01:05.650
for example if the user visited the second time after five minutes and after he clicked this button.

01:06.110 --> 01:08.590
So let's implement the code we need for that.

01:08.960 --> 01:16.890
So I'll switch back to my code and we implement that code in the app.js file. In there,

01:17.190 --> 01:22.340
I want to save this install banner to show it at a later point of time,

01:22.560 --> 01:28.530
I can react to the event that Chrome wants to show it with an event listener which I register on the

01:28.530 --> 01:29.560
window object,

01:29.580 --> 01:36.170
so on my browser window. There, the event I want to listen to is the beforeinstallprompt event,

01:36.180 --> 01:37.890
make sure to not mistype it,

01:38.010 --> 01:43.670
this is fired or triggered by Chrome right before it's about to show that installed banner.

01:44.040 --> 01:49.000
So in the function here, we get an event which basically this install banner event

01:49.680 --> 01:53.950
and here we can for example prevent the default.

01:54.210 --> 01:55.470
So this basically means

01:55.470 --> 01:58.740
now Chrome won't show the banner.

01:58.750 --> 02:02.430
I will also log something in the console before we do so,

02:02.520 --> 02:09.290
I will say beforeinstallprompt fired, like that,

02:09.490 --> 02:14.700
then we also prevent the showing of this and now I want to show it at a later point of time.

02:14.710 --> 02:17.290
Now for that, I'll store it in a variable,

02:17.310 --> 02:19.940
I'll create a new variable at the top here which I'll name

02:20.120 --> 02:21.850
deferredPrompt

02:22.990 --> 02:29.850
and I will store the event in this variable, so deferredPrompt is equal to the event, then I'll return false

02:29.850 --> 02:33.060
to not do anything upon this event.

02:33.180 --> 02:38.580
Now we wanted to do something once the user click the plus icon, which is the case here in the feed.js

02:38.660 --> 02:40.540
file, there

02:40.650 --> 02:48.450
we have this share image button event listener. The share image button simply is the button here, this button

02:49.020 --> 02:52.440
which is this plus at the bottom right corner.

02:52.560 --> 02:56.740
So there we call open create post modal, this function here,

02:56.910 --> 03:02.220
so it's in this function that we could show this prompt if we wanted to.

03:02.220 --> 03:09.690
Now to do so, I will first have to check if we already did have a chance to show it because we can't

03:09.690 --> 03:10.740
show it on our own,

03:10.740 --> 03:14.410
we need to have Chrome at least try to do so.

03:14.460 --> 03:17.990
Here I'll check if deferredPrompt is set,

03:18.000 --> 03:24.450
so if this is null or undefined, this will not execute. Inside this code which is only executed if the

03:24.450 --> 03:26.320
deferredPrompt is somehow set,

03:26.340 --> 03:32.890
I can now call deferredPrompt, prompt, the prompt method which will now show this banner.

03:32.920 --> 03:37.000
Again this is only possible since Chrome already tried to do so earlier.

03:37.800 --> 03:47.110
Then as a next step, we can see what the user picked by adding deferredPrompt user choice then,

03:47.120 --> 03:53.130
so user choice is a promise and here we'll execute a function which will give us the choice

03:53.130 --> 03:54.860
result.

03:54.920 --> 03:59.720
So this function is executed once the user made a choice and choice result basically gives us information

03:59.720 --> 04:03.040
about which choice that was.

04:03.050 --> 04:11.750
Now with that, I can first of all console log the choice result outcome which is basically a string describing

04:11.750 --> 04:12.960
the choice of the user

04:13.160 --> 04:15.010
and of course I can check for it,

04:15.080 --> 04:21.170
I can check if the choice result outcome is equal to dismissed,

04:21.200 --> 04:25.670
which is the case if the user clicked the x, the close button,

04:25.670 --> 04:34.680
in this case I can say user cancelled installation. Of course that's a pity

04:34.690 --> 04:40.170
and we actually can't show the prompt again because we only have one chance

04:40.250 --> 04:46.600
but we did our best, user can still add it through the menu of course with add to home screen and this is,

04:46.620 --> 04:46.920
well

04:46.930 --> 04:52.960
what we have to go with but of course, we can also have the success case here where we can then console

04:52.960 --> 05:03.080
log user added to home screen. This of course is the case we're looking for. Now

05:03.100 --> 05:08.540
in any case what I'll do at the end is I'll set deferredPrompt equal to null

05:08.590 --> 05:11.310
because we used it, we can't use it again 

05:11.350 --> 05:12.610
so we had our chance,

05:12.620 --> 05:19.750
this is the code we want to execute. With that, I'll save this and we can now test this and see if we can

05:19.750 --> 05:24.780
actually control the way the prompt is shown as we hope to do.

05:25.540 --> 05:32.230
For that, I'll go back in my remote developer tools and there first of all, I need to do something,

05:32.560 --> 05:38.880
I need to clean the site data by clicking the i, site settings and then clear and reset because Chrome

05:38.910 --> 05:42.810
of course still has saved that I did dismiss this banner.

05:42.820 --> 05:49.170
Now I can revisit the page and I should be able to click add to home screen again

05:49.570 --> 05:55.810
and you do see, beforeinstallprompt was fired, actually was fired twice because up on the reloading,

05:55.810 --> 05:58.850
Chrome already tried to show me this prompt.

05:58.910 --> 06:05.070
Now watch what happens if I click the plus, you see here I get this banner

06:05.130 --> 06:09.190
and if I do click add here, we see accepted was the choice,

06:09.190 --> 06:12.740
user added to homescreen is the log we print.

06:12.810 --> 06:14.410
So this is now working,

06:14.430 --> 06:21.300
now we can control how does this shown, how the prompt is shown, when it is shown and we can try to show

06:21.300 --> 06:23.480
it at the best possible moment.

06:23.490 --> 06:28.660
So here, we already take advantage of having a service worker because now at least we can show this prompt

06:29.310 --> 06:32.820
and we'll soon add much more logic with service workers.

06:32.820 --> 06:38.910
It's great that we already can prompt the user to add this to his home screen though because that is

06:39.000 --> 06:41.090
where we want to get to with our application.
