In the last lectures, we added our first options to the notification,

00:06.590 --> 00:07.840
now there are more options

00:07.870 --> 00:14.560
I want to show to you. The next important option is the tag option. Now tag allows you as you might guess

00:14.560 --> 00:16.480
to assign a tag to your notification,

00:16.570 --> 00:20.290
for example confirm notification.

00:20.320 --> 00:24.760
Now the cool thing about the tag is it acts like an ID for that notification

00:24.760 --> 00:31.990
and if you send more or display more notifications with the same tag, they will actually not be displayed

00:31.990 --> 00:35.390
beneath each other but they will stack onto each other,

00:35.440 --> 00:41.820
so basically, the latest notification with the same tag will replace the previous one with the same tag.

00:42.100 --> 00:47.260
So if you have two notifications using confirmed notification, only one will be displayed on your mobile

00:47.260 --> 00:49.400
device or on your device in general,

00:49.630 --> 00:55.570
if you don't set the tag option, they will actually display beneath each other which sometimes is the

00:55.580 --> 00:56.680
behavior you want,

00:56.680 --> 00:58.490
think about news websites who

00:58.490 --> 01:00.670
want to push new headlines, 

01:00.730 --> 01:05.680
definitely don't want to overwrite new headlines other ones because they might not be related but

01:05.680 --> 01:11.890
on other applications, you might simply want to show one notification at a time to not spam the user.

01:12.130 --> 01:16.900
So by setting tag here, you ensure that the notifications actually stack.

01:16.930 --> 01:20.800
So that's a useful feature to control how your notifications display.

01:20.800 --> 01:27.430
Keep in mind, some operating systems will overwrite this anyways, so on some operating systems, your app

01:27.430 --> 01:31.480
might only be allowed to push one notification at a time anyways

01:31.480 --> 01:37.360
but if an operating system theoretically allows you to have multiple notifications at a time, this allows

01:37.360 --> 01:39.720
you to control how they should be displayed.

01:39.850 --> 01:48.920
Connected to tag is re-notify. Re-notify if set to true allows you or makes sure that even if you use

01:48.920 --> 01:56.200
the same tag, a new notification will still vibrate and alert the user. If it's set to false and you

01:56.200 --> 02:02.740
use the same tag on notifications, new notifications of the same tag actually won't vibrate the phone

02:02.740 --> 02:05.600
again and won't notify the user again.

02:05.620 --> 02:11.050
So if you set this to false and use tags, you have very passive notifications only sitting in the top

02:11.050 --> 02:14.690
bar and vibrating on the very first notification.

02:14.950 --> 02:21.300
If you set it to true, you still don't spam the user but you have a vibration on each new notification

02:21.400 --> 02:28.090
and if you disable both, you send a notification every time and they will sit beneath each other and

02:28.090 --> 02:29.620
maybe spam the user,

02:29.620 --> 02:33.560
it really depends on which kind of app you're building.

02:33.590 --> 02:41.020
So these are tag and re-notify, core options to control how you display your notifications

02:41.030 --> 02:48.590
and important for you, to control that you use notifications responsibly and don't spam the user.

02:48.590 --> 02:51.390
Now there's one other important feature set I'll

02:51.440 --> 02:53.300
dive into in the next lecture

02:53.300 --> 02:56.510
and these are actions on your notifications.
