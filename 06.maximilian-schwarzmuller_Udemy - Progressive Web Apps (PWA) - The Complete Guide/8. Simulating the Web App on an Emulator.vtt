00:02.350 --> 00:08.920
Now you might not have an Android phone for testing but you need one because Android phones by default

00:08.920 --> 00:13.390
have the Chrome browser which supports all progressive web app features,

00:13.540 --> 00:20.620
so we want to use that. Yes we could install that on iOS but on the iOS simulator, it's actually not as easily

00:20.620 --> 00:21.640
possible

00:21.640 --> 00:29.230
to, well go back to the home screen, install new apps as it is on the Android simulator or to be precise,

00:29.230 --> 00:30.650
there you don't need to do that.

00:30.790 --> 00:32.350
So that's why I'll use Android,

00:32.350 --> 00:36.250
there we have the whole testing set up already working out of the box

00:36.250 --> 00:43.000
and another nice bonus, the Android Studio which I downloaded here, you can find a file with set up instructions

00:43.000 --> 00:47.270
attached to this video, Android Studio works on Mac and Windows,

00:47.410 --> 00:54.520
so that is why I choose that. In there, I will simply create a new application and I don't need to configure

00:54.520 --> 00:59.610
anything special there because I don't really care about the application we create here,

00:59.620 --> 01:05.710
I just want to have an Android application and once the project did open, I'm only interested in one specific

01:05.710 --> 01:13.220
tool which we can find under Tools, Android, the AVD manager which is the device manager because I want

01:13.220 --> 01:20.200
to start a device, a virtual device which allows me to basically test this application.

01:20.440 --> 01:25.960
So let's click this play button here or create a new virtual device where you pick any blueprint you

01:25.960 --> 01:28.510
want to use, I'll stick to the one I already have

01:28.750 --> 01:30.720
to start this virtual device.

01:30.900 --> 01:32.670
Now this will take a couple of seconds,

01:32.680 --> 01:35.970
again you'll find a document where this is explained

01:36.040 --> 01:37.770
attached to this video.

01:37.840 --> 01:40.260
Now I'll be back once this did start up here.

01:40.540 --> 01:42.460
So the device started here on my machine,

01:42.460 --> 01:44.400
now again that's a virtual device,

01:44.530 --> 01:53.770
the cool thing is here we can open Chrome and accept this, thank you and in there, simply open our web

01:53.800 --> 02:03.120
app. Now localhost:8080 won't work here because that refers to the localhost on that simulator

02:03.250 --> 02:14.500
but we can visit 10.0.2.2:8080 which is like a proxy to our localhost on the local

02:14.500 --> 02:15.210
machine

02:15.370 --> 02:21.700
and there you see this application. This application used on the browser a few seconds ago, now running

02:21.700 --> 02:26.060
on a, well real device, on a real simulator of a real device.

02:26.060 --> 02:31.960
Now we want to see if we can actually add it to the home screen and you would be prompted whether you

02:31.960 --> 02:33.640
want to install it or not

02:33.640 --> 02:36.670
after a certain amount of criteria are met,

02:36.670 --> 02:38.330
more about this in the next lecture

02:38.500 --> 02:45.730
but for now, I will simply click add to home screen here and as you can see, this already suggests this

02:45.750 --> 02:53.500
icon and this text which is our short name and if I click add and go back to the home screen, you see

02:53.560 --> 03:01.660
our icon here with our short name. If I click on it, you actually saw this splash screen for a brief

03:01.840 --> 03:02.350
second,

03:02.350 --> 03:05.170
let me quickly dismiss this application and open again,

03:05.170 --> 03:06.150
watch closely,

03:06.220 --> 03:10.540
here's the splash screen and you also see in the task switcher,

03:10.750 --> 03:12.430
here's the Chrome browser

03:12.520 --> 03:14.650
but this is our application,

03:14.770 --> 03:20.800
it has this standalone view with our own theme color in the toolbar.

03:20.800 --> 03:22.680
This is not the Chrome toolbar,

03:22.680 --> 03:27.870
it's our own toolbar with our icon, the short name and a theme color.

03:28.090 --> 03:29.720
So it's not this toolbar,

03:29.740 --> 03:30.770
watch closely,

03:30.790 --> 03:31.070
we have an

03:31.070 --> 03:31.810
icon here,

03:31.900 --> 03:35.200
it's a separate toolbar created by the task switcher

03:35.230 --> 03:41.830
because we did set up an icon, a short name and a theme color and it is displayed next to Chrome,

03:41.860 --> 03:45.380
so it really runs standalone which we specified.

03:45.520 --> 03:47.040
If we switch orientation here,

03:47.080 --> 03:49.890
you see we stick to portrait mode,

03:49.960 --> 03:56.570
no matter how I turn this, even here it doesn't flip because we specified portrait primary.

03:56.800 --> 04:00.640
So this is our web application running on a native device.

04:00.670 --> 04:05.770
Now as I said, we install it manually by clicking add to home screen

04:05.980 --> 04:11.720
but you would also be prompted by the browser if a couple of conditions are fulfilled.

04:11.740 --> 04:13.560
Now why would this be nice?

04:13.570 --> 04:17.320
Because if the browser asks the user if he wants to install it,

04:17.500 --> 04:23.350
well that's obviously much better because here the user has to actively go to the menu and add our page,

04:23.350 --> 04:28.930
well if the browser asks which would be a ribbon coming up from the bottom here, we might be much more

04:28.930 --> 04:34.390
inclined to actually add it. Now I'll show you the conditions and how this banner will look like in the next

04:34.390 --> 04:34.880
lecture.
