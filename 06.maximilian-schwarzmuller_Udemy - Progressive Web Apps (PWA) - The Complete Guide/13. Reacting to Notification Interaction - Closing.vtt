In the last lecture, we listen to notification clicks,

00:05.230 --> 00:11.020
now I want to listen to the user closing a notification and close basically means that for example

00:11.080 --> 00:18.920
on Android or on any phone, you just swipe it away or click the X or you close all notifications.

00:18.940 --> 00:22.570
This is what closed means, on Mac there is a close button.

00:22.900 --> 00:24.610
You basically don't interact with it,

00:24.640 --> 00:27.320
you don't click on it, you just close it.

00:27.670 --> 00:33.820
So we can listen to that again in the service worker for the same reasons as why we listen to notification

00:33.820 --> 00:38.680
click and here we listen to notification close.

00:38.710 --> 00:45.010
Now there, we also pass a function which gets executed whenever this event occurs and we can then also

00:45.010 --> 00:47.170
get some information about that event.

00:47.170 --> 00:58.160
so here I simply want to log notification was closed and output the event. To demonstrate this close behavior,

00:58.200 --> 01:05.150
I connected my real Android device again and there I reset the site settings and refresh the page

01:05.400 --> 01:09.110
and now I'll click enable notifications again there.

01:09.110 --> 01:12.280
Now this gives me the notification here in the top bar.

01:12.350 --> 01:19.710
Now I could could click one of the actions but I can also just swipe it away or simply click this delete

01:19.770 --> 01:21.490
all button here at the bottom.

01:21.720 --> 01:24.520
So I will tap that to close all notifications

01:24.720 --> 01:31.530
and now you see notification was closed, was fired and I get my notification event here which they basically

01:31.530 --> 01:34.760
again hold some information about the notification

01:34.920 --> 01:41.030
and in general, about this whole event service worker scope and so on.

01:41.040 --> 01:43.120
So this is how we can interact with it,

01:43.170 --> 01:45.330
notification was closed,

01:45.330 --> 01:51.080
to be precise notification close, this event here is a great listener to for example send analytics data

01:51.090 --> 01:55.100
to your server because the user didn't interact with your notification.

01:55.230 --> 02:00.990
Maybe you want to store the timestamp of the notification and try to find out why users didn't interact

02:00.990 --> 02:01.610
with it,

02:01.800 --> 02:06.050
that is what you could typically do in this event listener here.

02:06.360 --> 02:10.520
So with that, we learned about notification click and notification close,

02:10.620 --> 02:13.200
that's already a lot and super important

02:13.320 --> 02:20.520
but I'd say with the basics about notifications set, let's move on to go into the push part of this core

02:20.520 --> 02:21.450
section.

02:21.540 --> 02:27.900
We want to learn how we can not only display notifications by triggering it in our Javascript code but

02:27.900 --> 02:34.940
by pushing some message from some other server to our own front-end web application. We'll do this next.
