WEBVTT

00:02.330 --> 00:03.820
We're almost done with this course

00:03.860 --> 00:06.460
but there's one more thing I want to show you.

00:06.710 --> 00:12.200
In the beginning of this course, I mentioned that single page applications and progressive web apps are

00:12.290 --> 00:13.560
not related at all,

00:13.580 --> 00:16.360
these are not alternatives to each other.

00:16.360 --> 00:21.500
Instead you can turn your single page application into a progressive web app by simply adding some of

00:21.500 --> 00:26.730
the features and enhancing this application, just as you can do it with any application.

00:27.050 --> 00:33.530
And the tools I showed you in this course can be used in the exact same way as I showed them in any application,

00:33.650 --> 00:37.590
no matter if it's a single page one, a multi-page one, whatever.

00:37.880 --> 00:44.300
Nonetheless in this module, I briefly want to show you how to turn a React, Vue and Angular app into

00:44.300 --> 00:46.470
a progressive web app.

00:46.470 --> 00:49.310
Now I won't take a complex finished one to be honest,

00:49.430 --> 00:55.670
I'll instead show you how you can quickly get started to create your next React, Vue or Angular project

00:55.940 --> 00:57.340
as a progressive web app.

00:57.650 --> 01:02.970
If you want to transform an existing one, we're back to what I told you in the course, simply add the

01:02.970 --> 01:06.890
features, service worker and so on to the existing application

01:06.920 --> 01:08.600
but as this module would show,

01:08.600 --> 01:13.110
it's also easy to get started with a progressive web app right from the start

01:13.130 --> 01:16.010
when creating a new project with one of these frameworks.
