So let's dive into web push notifications, an extremely powerful feature we can add to progressive web

00:08.630 --> 00:12.700
apps to really turn them into native application-like experiences,

00:13.070 --> 00:16.220
why would we want to use push notifications?

00:16.550 --> 00:20.040
Well there are multiple reasons, here are some of the most important ones.

00:20.210 --> 00:27.070
For one, if we use push notifications, we can inform users even if they have our web app,

00:27.110 --> 00:34.280
so the tab or the whole browser closed, especially on Chrome for Android, this is the case. There a service

00:34.280 --> 00:39.260
process, a background process of the Chrome browser will keep on running in the background even if the

00:39.260 --> 00:45.740
application is closed and we'll use our service worker to receive incoming push notifications, to alert

00:45.740 --> 00:50.620
the user even if he's currently not doing anything or if the phone is in the pocket.

00:50.840 --> 00:56.960
This of course is huge because it allows us to communicate with the user even if he's not using our

00:56.960 --> 00:57.670
web app

00:57.830 --> 01:00.680
and that of course drives user engagement.

01:00.860 --> 01:08.180
This is another core feature of push notifications, giving us the possibility to reach out to users even

01:08.180 --> 01:15.100
if they're not actively using our application gives us a chance of bringing them back to our application.

01:15.110 --> 01:21.580
That's one major advantage native applications built for Android or iOS had in the past,

01:21.590 --> 01:25.110
now we can leverage this in our web applications too.

01:25.520 --> 01:30.540
Additionally, it simply is a more mobile app-like experience we're delivering.

01:30.630 --> 01:36.730
If people are using an application and be that a web application which they can install on their home

01:36.730 --> 01:40.260
screen, they are used to getting push notifications,

01:40.310 --> 01:45.590
they are used to getting informed about updates in our app and we definitely want to deliver this experience

01:45.590 --> 01:52.510
to them especially since we also as a developer have significant advantages due to the first points

01:52.520 --> 01:54.270
mentioned here on the slide.
