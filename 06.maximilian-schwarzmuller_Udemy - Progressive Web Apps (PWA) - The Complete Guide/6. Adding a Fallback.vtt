00:02.140 --> 00:11.830
So in the last video, we added code to store our post in indexedDB and to then register this as a synchronization

00:11.830 --> 00:13.660
task with the service worker.

00:13.660 --> 00:20.080
We also added this visual sugar here to output a message to the user that we stored that for syncing.

00:20.080 --> 00:27.760
Now of course what happens if we don't support service worker or sync manager though? Then we don't send anything

00:27.760 --> 00:28.470
at all right now and

00:28.480 --> 00:30.790
that of course is definitely not what I want to do.

00:30.970 --> 00:38.140
So I'll add an else statement because it's important, when building progressive web apps, we add features progressively.

00:38.560 --> 00:43.540
An important part of that is that it still works on older browsers and here, a browser doesn't even have

00:43.540 --> 00:44.500
to be that old, 

00:44.550 --> 00:49.300
sync manager is a feature which isn't supported in all browsers, even in the modern ones.

00:49.630 --> 00:56.040
So we definitely need to provide a fallback logic and for that, I'll create a new function which I'll

00:56.050 --> 01:02.260
call send data and this will directly send the data to the back-end without using the synchronization

01:02.260 --> 01:02.760
event.

01:02.980 --> 01:09.100
So here I want to call send data and that is super important because if we don't have that, we don't

01:09.100 --> 01:14.390
support older browsers which would be very bad. Inside send data here,

01:14.620 --> 01:17.880
I now want to send data to my back-end

01:18.370 --> 01:20.340
and we already do have a back-end,

01:20.560 --> 01:25.780
we already have this Firebase project where we get data from. Now we can't just get data from it,

01:25.780 --> 01:29.020
we can also send data to it with a post request.

01:29.020 --> 01:30.210
So this is what I want to do,

01:30.210 --> 01:35.110
I want to send data to this back-end and for that, I will use fetch.

01:35.110 --> 01:37.780
Now I can use fetch since we added a polyfill,

01:37.810 --> 01:40.530
so this will also work in older browsers.

01:41.140 --> 01:47.180
Now fetch then takes this API endpoint with the .json at the end just like for getting the data

01:47.410 --> 01:52.750
but of course to return this to the post request, I need to pass a second argument to fetch where I set method

01:52.810 --> 01:54.420
to post.

01:54.460 --> 02:02.450
I also have to specify a body here and that body shall be Javascript object, to be precise,

02:02.470 --> 02:09.180
I'll use JSON stringify here to turn this into JSON data

02:09.610 --> 02:14.480
and there I want to send an ID where I use new date toIsoString,

02:14.560 --> 02:23.600
I want to set a title which is title input.value and of course a location which is location input.value.

02:23.680 --> 02:25.390
So it's basically the same data

02:25.450 --> 02:29.120
we already store here from a set up perspective.

02:29.140 --> 02:33.720
I'll also copy that link here to an image as a dummy right now,

02:33.790 --> 02:39.520
we will later add a way to take an image in the application so that I'm also able to send an image to

02:39.520 --> 02:45.860
the back-end. I'll just send this string here, without the double quotation marks, just normal quotation marks

02:45.860 --> 02:46.480
here.

02:46.660 --> 02:48.400
So this is the data I want to send,

02:48.640 --> 02:52.890
lastly what I'll also do is before specifying the body,

02:53.140 --> 02:55.170
I'll set up some headers here

02:55.240 --> 02:57.800
where I'll be clear about what data we're sending,

02:58.150 --> 03:07.240
we'll obviously send content type application/json data and we of course also accept data of that

03:07.240 --> 03:09.160
response, so application/json

03:09.190 --> 03:10.470
.

03:10.480 --> 03:16.600
So this is the post request I want to send in send data which just remind you will be executed if our

03:16.600 --> 03:20.480
browser does not support service workers or the sync manager.

03:21.600 --> 03:24.380
Now that will send the fetch method,

03:24.520 --> 03:29.610
of course I want to react to the response here and see if that works,

03:29.620 --> 03:37.240
so here I will simply log send data and then output the response like this.

03:37.240 --> 03:40.570
You can of course also use response JSON to extract that,

03:40.690 --> 03:43.140
for me it's fine to do it like that.

03:43.150 --> 03:48.400
You may also want to call update UI here to reload the page basically, rebuild the page once the data

03:48.400 --> 03:54.030
has been sent because now you can fetch the updated data from the back-end or you add the card manually

03:54.060 --> 03:56.220
with Javascript, whatever you like.

03:56.650 --> 03:58.140
So this is our fallback,

03:58.180 --> 03:59.520
send data,

03:59.710 --> 04:04.950
now let's go back to handling the synchronization event though and it was useful that we wrote the

04:04.950 --> 04:10.070
send data method here because we're going to use something very comparable in the service worker.
