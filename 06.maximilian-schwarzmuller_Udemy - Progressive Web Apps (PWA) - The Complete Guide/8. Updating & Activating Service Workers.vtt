In the last video we added code to react to the install and activate eventt and once we did so and reloaded

00:08.140 --> 00:13.820
the page, we saw service worker registered and we saw installing service worker.

00:13.980 --> 00:16.430
Now there are two things which are strange here -

00:16.450 --> 00:21.100
the obvious one is the activate log is missing,

00:21.190 --> 00:26.420
the maybe not so obvious one is why is service worker registered executing first,

00:26.620 --> 00:29.280
shouldn't this execute once registration is done?

00:29.620 --> 00:34.960
Well actually since we have two separate threads here, app.js, your normal Javascript code in the service

00:34.960 --> 00:37.820
worker, Chrome can't guarantee the order here

00:38.200 --> 00:43.750
but in theory this executes after you installed the service worker,

00:43.900 --> 00:45.880
however you can't rely on this.

00:45.940 --> 00:51.910
Now the more interesting thing however is the service worker activation, where is that console log, wasn't

00:51.940 --> 00:53.910
that event fired?

00:54.250 --> 00:55.560
Indeed it wasn't

00:55.780 --> 00:59.080
and we can get more insights if we click on application.

00:59.080 --> 01:03.680
There you see that the new service worker is waiting to activate.

01:03.820 --> 01:05.500
You'll see it was received

01:05.920 --> 01:08.080
but it wasn't activated yet.

01:08.470 --> 01:14.320
Now it's important to understand if you have a tab open or if you have a window open with your page,

01:15.250 --> 01:20.530
then new service workers will get installed but not activated.

01:20.560 --> 01:22.710
The reason for this is that

01:22.750 --> 01:29.290
the page is maybe still communicating with the old service worker and activating a new one which might

01:29.290 --> 01:33.730
introduce breaking changes might break the running page.

01:33.730 --> 01:41.050
Therefore the way to activate a new version is to close the existing tab and reopen it so that you have

01:41.080 --> 01:46.590
all tabs closed, if you have multiple ones open, close all the tabs. Re-open it and now you see the new version

01:46.630 --> 01:53.250
is activated and running and in the console, you now see installing and then activating.

01:53.320 --> 01:58.150
Now we have that activating log too and we can have a look at the event there.

01:58.270 --> 02:06.400
This is crucial to understand, if you change code in your service worker, you need to close all the existing

02:06.400 --> 02:10.890
tabs and open a new one to load the newest version.

02:11.020 --> 02:16.530
Now when using the developer tools, there are shortcuts, you can check update and reload

02:16.630 --> 02:20.740
and then reload will have hard overwrite existing service workers,

02:20.770 --> 02:23.490
so you don't need to close that page.

02:23.530 --> 02:30.790
You can also click unregistered and reload to fetch a new version or click update or you maybe saw it,

02:30.790 --> 02:32.310
we'll get a chance to see it later too,

02:32.800 --> 02:37.660
there was this skip waiting link next to the unactivated service worker.

02:37.720 --> 02:43.420
If you click this, it will also immediately skip waiting and activate the new service worker.

02:43.480 --> 02:48.460
These are all tricks you can use during development, not in production though of course because your

02:48.460 --> 02:52.710
users probably won't use this written here in the developer tools

02:52.990 --> 02:56.930
and it's important to understand how it works behind the scenes anyways,

02:57.010 --> 02:57.900
super important.
