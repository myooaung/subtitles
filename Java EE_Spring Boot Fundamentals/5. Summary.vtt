00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:05.100
In this module, we learned that Spring Boot is just an

2
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.200
extension of the Spring Framework.

3
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.480
It provides a much simpler and faster way to set up,

4
00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.830
configure, and run applications.

5
00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:15.980
I taught you about automatic configuration that

6
00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.730
automatically configures the application based on

7
00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:21.840
libraries added to your project's class path.

8
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.740
We looked at starter dependencies that are starter packs that

9
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.740
include all of the dependent libraries you need.

10
00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:31.300
We looked at the CLI,

11
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.650
which is the commandâ€‘line interface to rapidly prototype

12
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:39.420
your applications and the actuator that allows you to manage

13
00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:46.000
and monitor your applications. Next, let's look at bootstrapping a simple application.
