00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,590
Entities are objects that live in a database,

2
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:08,720
and they have the ability to be mapped to a database.

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,430
Entities are defined by the @Entity annotation,

4
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:16,930
and on this screen we are looking at the Application entity. And we

5
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:22,010
will see the detailed code for this in a moment.

6
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:28,440
Traditionally, JPA entity classes are specified in a persistence.xml file.

7
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,300
However, with Spring Boot, this file is not necessary,

8
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:36,530
and entity scanning is used. By default, all packages

9
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:38,880
below the main configuration class,

10
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:42,460
the one annotated with either @SpringBootApplication or

11
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:50,000
@EnableAllConfiguration are searched. Any classes annotated with @Entity are included.
