00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:04,320
We've reached the end of the course.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:08,190
Thanks for following along with me and being fully engaged.

3
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:10,650
You've mastered Spring Boot Fundamentals,

4
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:15,430
and you've learned how to make development faster and deployment easier.

5
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:16,570
Let's recap.

6
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:19,480
We started by talking about the benefits of Spring Boot,

7
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:22,390
which you've seen firsthand during this course,

8
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:26,850
things like the Spring Boots Starters and automatic configuration.

9
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:31,690
You've seen how easy it was to bootstrap a simple application using the Spring

10
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:38,740
Initializr. We then saw how easy it was to access data using the H2 database

11
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:41,960
and creating simple queries using repositories.

12
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:47,910
Next, we looked at configuring a Spring MVC application using Spring Boot.

13
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:54,380
Then, we looked at the REST architecture style while building a RESTful service.

14
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:59,070
Then, we explored GraphQL, which is a query language for APIs.

15
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:04,090
We saw this by creating a GraphQL server that exposed APIs to create,

16
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:06,640
read, update, and delete data.

17
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,770
We then learned how to make applications production ready by using

18
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:14,930
Spring Boot Actuator for monitoring and metrics.

19
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:17,640
We then wrapped up with testing.

20
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,430
I encourage you to take all that you've learned about Spring Boot and

21
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:27,000
put it to good use as you build your web applications. Good luck in your future endeavors!
