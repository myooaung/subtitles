00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:06,600
Today I showed you how to configure a Spring MVC application using Spring Boot

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:12,440
covering topics such as the needed POM file dependencies.

3
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:15,640
We then had an overview of the MVC design pattern,

4
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:19,530
including the Model, View, and Controller layers for TrackZilla.

5
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:22,280
Remember that the View layer of TrackZilla uses a

6
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:25,040
templating engine called Thymeleaf.

7
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:28,260
We also learned about useful annotations like

8
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:33,230
@Controller, @Repository, and @Service.

9
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:36,730
We saw how Spring Boot's automatic configuration assists

10
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:40,040
with setting up Spring MVC applications.

11
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,670
We wrapped up with me showing you how simple it was to deploy an

12
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:52,000
application using an embedded Tomcat server. Next, I will show you how to build a RESTful web application with Spring Boot.
