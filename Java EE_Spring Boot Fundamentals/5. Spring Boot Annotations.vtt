The @SpringBootApplication annotation is a very important annotation

2
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:10.450
that has to be added to the Main application class to indicate that

3
00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:13.530
the application should utilize Spring Boot.

4
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.670
It is a shortcut annotation that applies three annotations in one

5
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:27.410
statement, @SpringBootConfiguration, @EnableAutoConfiguration, and

6
00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:37.000
@ComponentScan. Using the one @SpringBootApplication annotation instead of all three saves time.
