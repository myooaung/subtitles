00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:04,580
GraphQL also has the ability to update the data stored

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:07,310
on the server by means of mutations.

3
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:11,870
Mutations such as creating, updating, or deleting will change the data,

4
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:13,115
unlike a query.

5
00:00:13,115 --> 00:00:16,640
Mutations are defined in the Java code by defining a class

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,070
that implements GraphQLMutationResolver.

7
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:24,620
I've opened the project and navigated to Mutation.java.

8
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:27,140
Let's take a look at it.

9
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:30,990
Mutation implements GraphQLMutationResolver.

10
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:34,450
The mutation resolver allows Spring to automatically detect and

11
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:37,300
call the right method in response to one of the GraphQL

12
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:40,440
mutations declared inside of the schema.

13
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:46,280
So in the schema for Mutation, there are three, creating a new application,

14
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:50,660
deleting an application, and updating the application owner.

15
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:54,580
So there're three methods that map to those operations.

16
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:57,720
Here we have the newApplication.

17
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:01,170
It simply creates a new application with the values passed in,

18
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:05,040
and it calls the save method on the applicationRepository.

19
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,160
Next, we have the deleteApplication method,

20
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:13,040
and it calls the deleteById method on the applicationRepository and returns

21
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:20,230
true. And, lastly, on line 31, we have updateApplicationOwner. It takes in the

22
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:23,680
newOwner and the ID of the application to update,

23
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,805
and it uses the applicationRepository to first find the application,

24
00:01:27,805 --> 00:01:35,000
and then it calls the save method here on line 38. So this is a look at the mutation resolver.
