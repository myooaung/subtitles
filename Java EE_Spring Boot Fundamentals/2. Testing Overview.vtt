2
00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:08.380
Testing gives you confidence that your application is working when

3
00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:12.040
you introduce changes. In order to add testing to your

4
00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:17.540
application, first add spring‑boot‑starter‑test as a dependency to

5
00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:20.140
your POM file in the test scope.

6
00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:30.000
Spring‑boot‑starter‑test imports both Spring Boot test modules, as well as JUnit, AssertJ, Hamcrest, and a number of other useful libraries.
