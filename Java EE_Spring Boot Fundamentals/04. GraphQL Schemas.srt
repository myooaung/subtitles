The GraphQL schema defines the data points offered via an API.

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:11,310
The schema contains the data types and relationships between them and

3
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:15,260
the set of operations available, things like queries for retrieving

4
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:18,150
data and mutations for creating, updating,

5
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:20,540
reading, and deleting data.

6
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:24,570
I mentioned that graphql‑java‑tools is a helper library that

7
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:27,340
assists with parsing a GraphQL schema.

8
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:31,980
Behind the scenes, GraphicQL schema files found on the class path

9
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,540
are processed and the necessary beans are wired.

10
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:41,000
All schema files must have the extension of .graphqls and can be present anywhere.
