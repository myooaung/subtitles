00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:07.440
Let's talk about packaging and deployment of a Spring Boot application.

2
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:13.850
Spring Boot is very flexible and can deploy your apps to a variety of platforms.

3
00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:17.440
Spring Boot based applications can be packaged as a traditional web

4
00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.870
application in a .war file and deployed to an external application server

5
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:25.740
or as an executable JAR file with an embedded server.

6
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.750
In this lesson, for Trackzilla,

7
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.930
I'm taking a simpler approach to create a standalone application.

8
00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:36.270
I'm packaging everything in an executable JAR file with the main method.

9
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.190
I will use Spring support for embedding a Tomcat servlet container

10
00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.040
instead of deploying to an external instance.

11
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.140
If you notice in the POM file at the very bottom,

12
00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.130
there is a Spring Boot Maven plugin. The Spring Boot Maven

13
00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.230
plugin provides many convenient features.

14
00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.390
It repackages your .jar and .war files to make them executable.

15
00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.080
For .jar files, it collects all the jars on the classpath and

16
00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.300
builds a single runnable uber jar.

17
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.550
It also runs your Spring Boot application and searches for the

18
00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:13.980
public static void main method to flag as a runnable class. It

19
00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:17.460
provides a builtâ€‘in dependency resolver that sets the version number

20
00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.170
to match Spring Boot dependencies.

21
00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.120
And it also manages the lifecycle of the Spring Boot application and

22
00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.320
generates build information that can be used by a tool called the

23
00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:35.000
actuator that provides app monitoring and metrics, which we will talk about later.
