Hi, this is Kesha Williams from Pluralsight.

2
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:07,830
Welcome to my course, Spring Boot Fundamentals.

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:11,260
Spring Boot is an extension of the Spring Framework that helps

4
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:15,350
developers build simple and web‑based applications quickly with

5
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:18,830
less code by removing much of the boilerplate code and

6
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:24,250
configuration that characterizes Spring.

7
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:28,140
This course explores major features of Spring Boot,

8
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:31,900
like the time‑saving Spring Boots starters to help jump‑start

9
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,110
your development and auto‑configuration,

10
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:40,140
bootstrapping a simple application using the Spring Initializr,

11
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,480
data access,

12
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,810
and we look at the ease of development when you

13
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:49,840
combine Spring Boot with Spring MVC, RESTful API development,

14
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,040
and GraphQL servers.

15
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,440
I will also show you how to make your applications

16
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:57,640
production ready using the Spring Boot Actuator,

17
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,450
and we wrap up with me teaching you about unit and

18
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:03,140
integration testing with Spring Boot.

19
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:04,990
When you're finished with this course,

20
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:06,950
you will have mastered Spring Boot to make

21
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:14,940
development faster and deployments easier.

22
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:19,620
You will learn all of this while using a fun case study called TrackZilla,

23
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:24,740
a bug tracking application that will help you to develop using Spring Boot.

24
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:27,060
The demonstration vehicle for this course will be

25
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,630
based on a use case from Keysoft,

26
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:34,960
a fictitious company that needs to quickly develop an application to help manage

27
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,000
bug fixes and enhancement requests for their applications.

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,110
Keysoft's engineering team has decided to utilize Spring Boot

29
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:47,090
to make development faster and deployment easier with minimal

30
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:50,000
boilerplate code and configuration.

31
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,170
During the course,

32
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:58,000
you walk through the use case of creating the bug tracking application TrackZilla using Spring Boot.
