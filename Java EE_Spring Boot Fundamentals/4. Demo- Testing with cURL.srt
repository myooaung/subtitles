I just wanted to show you a quick and easy way to test the REST

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:09,470
API. I'm using a tool called cURL, and that essentially lets us

3
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:15,240
call out to APIs from the command line.

4
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,520
So the command is curl and then the URL.

5
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,430
So in this case,

6
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:27,250
it's tza/applications. And we see a list of the

7
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:31,340
applications in the database returned.

8
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:37,720
Let's also look at the tickets. So you would use curl and then the URL,

9
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:43,610
which is tza/tickets, and then this shows a list of tickets.

10
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:48,120
And let's look for one specific application.

11
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,690
So we're going to pass in the ID of one,

12
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:55,160
and that returns back the correct application.

13
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,780
This just shows a quick way to test APIs that you develop.

14
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:04,000
You can also use a tool like Postman, it has a really nice graphical user interface.
