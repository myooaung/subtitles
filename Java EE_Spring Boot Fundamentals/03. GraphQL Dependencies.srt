To include GraphQL in your project, a couple of dependencies are needed.

2
00:00:08,226 --> 00:00:13,495
Graphql‑spring‑boot‑starter, this starter is very helpful because it will add

3
00:00:13,495 --> 00:00:18,050
and automatically configure a GraphQL Servlet that you can access at

4
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:24,780
/graphql. This starter will also use a GraphQL schema library to parse all

5
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:27,480
schema files found on the class path.

6
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:32,710
The starter will also set up an endpoint that can access post requests.

7
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:39,000
The second dependency is graphql‑java‑tools. This is a helper library to parse the GraphQL schema.
