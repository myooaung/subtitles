00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:05,660
Since this lesson is devoted to the H2 in‑memory database,

2
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:08,560
I did want to take the time to show you a quick demo

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:12,950
on how to access that database.

4
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:17,810
You would go to localhosts:8080/h2.

5
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:23,100
And on this screen, we have the JDBC URL, and this needs to match

6
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,350
exactly what's found in the application.properties file.

7
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:31,200
So let's navigate to IntelliJ and look at the

8
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:39,040
application.properties file, and this is the JDBC URL bug tracker.

9
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,410
So let's go back to the console.

10
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:47,640
The username is sa, and there is no password, click Connect.

11
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:52,500
And notice here on the left‑hand side, we see our entities, so APPLICATION,

12
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,830
RELEASE, and TICKET.

13
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:58,520
If you click this, notice it automatically populates this

14
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,830
command window with the SQL statement that you need in order to

15
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:05,300
select rows from the application table.

16
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:11,820
Select Run, and it shows a list of all of the applications in the system.

17
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:17,930
You can clear it. You can also type SQL here, so select * from

18
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:24,020
release, and click Run, and it shows all of the releases, and

19
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:34,000
you're able to see all of the tickets. So this is a quick look at the H2 console for the in‑memory database.
