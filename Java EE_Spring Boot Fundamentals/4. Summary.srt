00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:05,200
Today, we enhanced the Trackzilla application by enabling the Spring Boot

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:09,010
Actuator to help us with production support and monitoring.

3
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:12,120
We saw the default endpoints of health and info,

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,240
and then you enabled additional metric endpoints.

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,440
We even saw how to create custom endpoints by

6
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:27,000
implementing the health indicator interface. Next, we will talk about testing with Spring Boot.
