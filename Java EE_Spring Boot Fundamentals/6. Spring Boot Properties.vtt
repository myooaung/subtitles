00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.210
Let's talk about the application.properties file.

2
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.570
This file allows you to add specific configurations for your

3
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.870
application. I've opened the fundamentals example,

4
00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.150
and I've navigated to the application.properties file

5
00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:18.720
found underneath the resources folder.

6
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.340
We've used this file already to add debug level logging for auto configurations.

7
00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.680
There are several additional configuration properties that can

8
00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.080
be added to this file based on your use case.

9
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.380
Throughout this course, we will continually add to this file.

10
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.250
For example,

11
00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.715
when we incorporate a database such as H2, we will add that database

12
00:00:39.715 --> 00:00:44.310
URL and other H2 configuration parameters here.

13
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:49.800
If you're curious about how many more Spring Boot properties are available,

14
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.590
this is a very helpful website.

15
00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.570
It lists all of the different options.

16
00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:03.090
There are logging options, caching options,

17
00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.440
embedded server configurations, Spring Session,

18
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.740
Spring Session JDBC, MongoDB, etc.

19
00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.000
The list goes on and on. I encourage you to review this file in more detail.
