Hi.

2
00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:04.020
This is Kesha Williams from Pluralsight.

3
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:05.480
Welcome to my course.

4
00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:07.630
Spring Boot Fundamentals.

5
00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:12.940
The users of the TrackZilla application appreciate the REST API we provided.

6
00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:13.590
However,

7
00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.000
there have been a few complaints that the API

8
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.840
returns way more data than they need.

9
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:19.750
With GraphQL,

10
00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.520
we can leave it up to the users to determine the

11
00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:30.110
datapoints they'd like returned, offering extreme flexibility and efficiency.

12
00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:35.265
Today, I will teach you about GraphQL, which is a query language for APIs.

13
00:00:35.265 --> 00:00:41.080
We will start with an overview of GraphQL and the GraphQL schema. I will show

14
00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:45.680
you how to build a GraphQL server that exposes APIs to create,

15
00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.430
read, update, and delete data. I will teach you about resolvers, queries,

16
00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:55.650
mutations, and how to handle errors. We will wrap up with

17
00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.725
GraphiQL, a web application that allows you to execute queries

18
00:00:59.725 --> 00:01:04.000
and mutations against a GraphQL server. So let's get started.
