Hello everyone and welcome to this python tutorial.

2
00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:12.770
In this video we are going to use our converter to convert our model for a mobile device let us do that.

3
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:19.370
We are going to define a variable called TAF light underscore model and we are going to set it to our

4
00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:25.970
converter which is the object defined in the previous video and called convert function on it.

5
00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:33.330
This function doesn't take any arguments so it can simply execute a cell by calling this function our

6
00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:39.870
converter is going to take the model and convert it to tens flow light version of the model.

7
00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:46.050
You can see that we defined the model and the converter and done the conversion to tons of low light

8
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.960
in a single line of code.

9
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.600
That was pretty exciting and very easy to do.

10
00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:57.920
This was a short and sweet video just for demonstration purposes on how to convert any model to tens

11
00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.200
of low light version of it.

12
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.790
