Hello everyone and welcome to this biking tutorial in the previous video we have defined the custom

2
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.300
head for our neural network.

3
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:15.960
And in this one we are going to create our final model by combining the base model with our custom head

4
00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.740
so in the first free cell ride model.

5
00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:28.950
And so far in the previous sections we use sequential method from our carers to create neural networks.

6
00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:36.430
But in this case since we are combining two neural networks we are going to use a simple model which

7
00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:41.290
allows us to specify the inputs and outputs separately right.

8
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.440
Do you have dot carers dot models.

9
00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:50.950
And now we control our sequential as always or model inside the model.

10
00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:59.570
We can specify inputs and outputs as you can see here in the dog string so set inputs to our model to

11
00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.580
assess the input layer from our base model.

12
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:13.530
So right base model dot inputs and for the output set our prediction layer and that's basically it.

13
00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:20.910
We have combined two networks from our base model we used inputs and from our custom had we use prediction

14
00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:25.950
layer to create one whole network for the end of the video.

15
00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.690
Let's change the structure of the whole network.

16
00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:29.170
Right.

17
00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:34.630
Model dot summary and as before we have all theirs from our base model.

18
00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.130
But if you scroll all down to the bottom you can see two neural layers.

19
00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:46.170
Our global average pooling layer and the dance layer which is our prediction layer as well and that's

20
00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.830
it for now.

21
00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:52.400
Now you know how to combine two networks and create your transfer learning model.

22
00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:58.110
If you have any questions or comments please bother them in the comments section otherwise see seen

23
00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:58.950
