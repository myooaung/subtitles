00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:06.620
Hello everyone and welcome to this python tutorial in the previous video we saved our model and now

2
00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.200
it's time to set up our production environment.

3
00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:16.400
The first step is to export the path to the model directory as environment variable.

4
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:23.390
If you haven't worked with Linux before there is a concept called environment variables and if you want

5
00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:30.320
path to be accessible from anywhere in the system you can export that as an environment variable and

6
00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.790
you can give your environment variable and individual name.

7
00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.830
In our case it is going to be model there.

8
00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:43.130
We are doing this step steps so that tells a flow serving library can easily find our model.

9
00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:50.990
Okay to complete this process right I's dot and Aaron and in brackets we need to specify the name for

10
00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.990
our environment variable.

11
00:00:53.060 --> 00:01:00.830
So in this case just put the model there then this is going to be equal to absolute path all the model

12
00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.080
there so right.

13
00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:12.730
Or is the DOT path the app's path of model the the next step is to call ours tends flow serving API

14
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.720
and start serving our model because this comment is a Linux command and not Python 1.

15
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:28.480
We need to write percentage percentage bash to enter in the terminal mode and this dash dash b g to

16
00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:34.200
run the comment in the background right now have and if you don't know what.

17
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:41.040
No have means it says to the Linux kernel that any commander that follows it should be executed in the

18
00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.380
background as a service.

19
00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:49.750
We are doing this so we can still interact with the notebook and the commander will keep running the

20
00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.000
whole model structure in the process.

21
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:59.890
In the separate thread after it right turns a flow model server and that's what we installed before

22
00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:05.610
at the beginning of the section and this command takes a few flags.

23
00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.330
The first one is that dash Rest Api port.

24
00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.920
Now we have to specify a port on which the model will be running on.

25
00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.950
I'll set 2 8 5 0 1 for this argument.

26
00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:27.850
You can set whatever number just make sure that it is not occupied by other service the next flag that

27
00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.440
we need to specify is dash dash model name.

28
00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:37.930
You could choose here whatever you want only make sure to remember it since you will be referencing

29
00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:46.980
a model by its name let's put C4 10 for example and the last flag to put here is dash dash model based

30
00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:47.810
path.

31
00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:56.200
In our case that is our environment variable called model the This command will work like this because

32
00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.530
of the no had we won't be able to see anything what is happening to our model.

33
00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.340
There is a way to export all lodgings to a separate file.

34
00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.170
So let's do that at the end of this command.

35
00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:14.290
After all flags put bigger than and now specify a name of a file.

36
00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.300
Let's write server dot log.

37
00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.550
And now let's specify a way of those longings.

38
00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:29.500
So just write to bigger then and 1 execute the cell and let's bring the last 10 rows of the server but

39
00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.260
log to see if our server is running in the first free cell.

40
00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:35.100
Right.

41
00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:36.970
Exclamation mark Dale.

42
00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:40.430
And our name or the log file server log.

43
00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.570
As you can see our API is running.

44
00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:44.920
Congratulations.

45
00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:52.850
We now have our image classification API up and running in the next video we are going to send our first

46
00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.550
request to the model.

47
00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:55.740
Stay tuned for that.

48
00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.400
And if you have any questions or comments please buzz them in the comments section.

49
00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.320
Otherwise I'll see in the next tutorial.
