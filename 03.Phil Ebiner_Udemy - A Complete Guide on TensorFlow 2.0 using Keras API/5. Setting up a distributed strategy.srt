Hello everyone and welcome to this python tutorial in this video.

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:11,950
We are going to define our distributed strategy in the first video of the section we find and talked

3
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:14,910
about distributed strategies in general.

4
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:21,660
For example there were a mirror strategy multi worker strategy and typical strategy.

5
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:29,330
All of them sounds very complicated because you need to incorporate multiple computers servers or multiple

6
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:29,890
dispute.

7
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:31,450
But in this video.

8
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:40,120
Trust me you're going to get very very excited because all of that is only one line of code one line

9
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:49,060
of code to distribute any modelling production to multiple abuse or multiple servers let's do that by

10
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:53,600
defining our mirror strategy for our model.

11
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,480
We will start by defining a variable called distribute.

12
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:02,210
It is going to be equal to the to distribute.

13
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:07,530
Now we need to specify which strategy we want to use in our case.

14
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:12,250
We are going to try mirror strategy after you are done with that.

15
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:14,760
Execute the cell and that's it.

16
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,690
In just one line of code we defined a mirror strategy.

17
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:23,220
We are going to use that to distribute any model in production.

18
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:30,470
It's very exciting times when we are allowed and able to in on this single line of code to distribute

19
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:35,900
any model across multiple or any number of disputes in the next video.

20
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:39,590
We are going to distribute our model using this strategy.

21
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:41,130
Stay tuned for that.

22
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:48,140
And in the meantime if you have any questions or comments please post them in the comments section otherwise

23
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:49,640
I'll send the next tutorial.
