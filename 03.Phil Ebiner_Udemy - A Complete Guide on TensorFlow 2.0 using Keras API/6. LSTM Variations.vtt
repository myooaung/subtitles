Hello and welcome back to the course on deep learning.

2
00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:09.780
Today we're just going to quickly cover off the variations of long short term memory architectures.

3
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:16.980
I think it's important so that you're at least aware that there are other alternatives to the list him

4
00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.610
version that we looked at and that you might encounter them sometime in your work.

5
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:27.530
So here is the standard Elysium which we discussed it should be it should be pretty comfortable food

6
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:28.470
by now.

7
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.630
And now let's have a look at a couple of variations some variation of.

8
00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:34.920
One is when you add peepholes.

9
00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:43.680
So I'm just gonna go back again so you see these lines are added connecting these sigmoid activation

10
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:53.280
functions or these layer neural network layer operations additional input is being provided it's information

11
00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.580
about the current state of the memory cell and that basically allows kind of like is that's why it's

12
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:06.840
called peephole allowance allows these decisions about devolves to be made with taking into account

13
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:13.380
what is actually sitting there in the memory modification number two is when you take these two valves

14
00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.820
forget valve and the memory valve and you connect them.

15
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:23.970
So let's go back instead of having a separate decision for the memory valve.

16
00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.190
Now you have a combined decision for the forget valve and the memory valve and basically when whenever

17
00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:30.740
you add something into memory.

18
00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.970
So whenever you close the memory off whenever this is zero this becomes the opposite one minus zero

19
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.980
becomes a once a you have to put something in if you put this if you make this a one or close to one

20
00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:46.380
is becomes a zero and therefore you don't put anything in here you just keep the old memory so it just

21
00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:55.050
makes sense to combine them sometimes and then another modification a very popular modification called

22
00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:02.910
the gated recurring units G are used for short they what they do is they completely get rid of the C

23
00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.460
pipeline as you can see the memory pipeline and they replace it with the H which is the hidden pipeline

24
00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:14.460
which we had before at the bottom they just combined basically the two So now instead of having two

25
00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:22.140
separate values one for the memory and one for the hidden state now you have one and it make it simplifies

26
00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:29.760
things so it's probably a bit less flexible but in terms of how many things are being controlled and

27
00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:36.420
monitored there there's actually less and and that's it and that's this is harder get it recurring you

28
00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.100
and works as you can see it might look a bit more confused but in reality it is a bit simpler you only

29
00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:48.660
have you know this this valve then you have another valve here another valve here and these two are

30
00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.040
kind of a connected as well.

31
00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:57.990
So this is in essence to get recurring unit the concept behind it is to get rid of the memory cell and

32
00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:03.940
just have this one pipeline going through there that takes care of everything.

33
00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:11.940
So there we go that's the three Elysium variations there's there's lots more other ones a good paper

34
00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:19.710
to check out is called Alice stem a search space odyssey by Klaus Graf and others 2015.

35
00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:27.060
So there they are compared quite a few different Alice jams you might like this research that they did.

36
00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.540
So there we go.

37
00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:34.200
That's a short intro into the alternative architectures of the Ellis team and I look forward to seeing

38
00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:34.960
you next time.

39
00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.390
Until then enjoy deep learning.
