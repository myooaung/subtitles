00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,350
Hello and welcome to this new editorial.

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:06,390
And now we begin our tenser flow 2.0 journey.

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:06,690
All right.

4
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:13,540
So remember intensive floor one in order to assess the values of a variable or a constant.

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:19,360
Well we had to initialize a session and assess the values of the tensor through the session.

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:24,610
And now you're going to see that things are going to be different with tangible 2.0.

7
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:29,370
There is a much easier way to access the values in a tensor.

8
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:29,670
All right.

9
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:36,750
So first before we execute any sense of low 2.0 COMMAND Well we have to of course install it and we

10
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:41,870
install it the same way with the pip command preceded by an exclamation mark.

11
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:48,630
And so there you go you have the tenth floor 2.0 0 point 0 version with the GP you so that you can gain

12
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:49,920
even more performance.

13
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:50,760
All right.

14
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:57,090
So once you execute this sale you get this download all the dependencies that you need to install tens

15
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:57,540
of.

16
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:59,020
They're all here.

17
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:01,560
So everything comes in a package.

18
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,420
Then of course you import it.

19
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:09,090
And we also import number because you're going to see that the way we accessed the values is also by

20
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:10,000
using by.

21
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:10,360
Right.

22
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:16,380
It's like 10th flow 2.0 made some new name by based feature we're going to see that in a second.

23
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,850
And then of course to check the 24 for version that you're using you can just run this and indeed we're

24
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:24,980
using tens of low 2.0 porno and now.

25
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:26,210
Well let's see.

26
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:30,740
Let's study the constants and variable incentive 2.0.

27
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,960
Right we have the whole structure here.

28
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:36,510
You can if you want to have a look at it first.

29
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:42,300
This is a structure right now we're being in with the constants so first of all how to define a constant

30
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:48,600
well with exactly the same way as we did with tensor flow one you know we take the sensible library

31
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:55,410
from which we call the constant function and inside you just enter the shape of your tensor.

32
00:01:55,410 --> 00:02:00,750
So here this is a two by two tensor with their values inside two rows two columns.

33
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,080
All right.

34
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:06,290
We called this new tensor tensor flow 20 as it tends to flow 2.0.

35
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:09,270
And then when you call it well there you go.

36
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:13,530
Now you have directly the values wasn't that so simple.

37
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:13,900
Right.

38
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:19,260
Before we only had this tier of the tensor and the idea and the shape you know two rows two columns

39
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:22,620
and the type of the values inside your tensor.

40
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:28,620
But now we get also the array you know with two rows and two columns and with the exact same values

41
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,460
as the one you entered here.

42
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:36,600
All right so that's a main new feature that is making your life a bit easier and that is a big change

43
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:38,910
in tensor flow 2.0 and then.

44
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,500
Well if you just want the shape you know if you just want the dimensions of your tensor well you can

45
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:50,400
just call the shape attribute from your tensor constant right and you will get tensor shape two rows

46
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:51,580
two columns.

47
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,140
OK.

48
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:58,140
So now in this next section you're going to see another way to get the values of a constant and actually

49
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:05,580
this will get you only the values that we see here and not this information above as you see you will

50
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:06,770
get directly the array.

51
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,150
And the trick to do that.

52
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:14,430
I just added it so that you know it as well to get the values straight from a tensor flow constant with

53
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:14,880
non pi.

54
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:20,850
That's why we important than pi and without the need of a session you just enter this you know your

55
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:28,050
constant tensor and then you just add non pi with some parenthesis and you will get directly to values.

56
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:28,380
Right.

57
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:29,700
So pretty practical too.

58
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:33,570
And mostly we're not needing any session right.

59
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:39,990
We won't bother opening new sessions now which was something we always did with tens of floor one each

60
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:45,660
time you know you are starting to build a new sense of flow program and especially a new neural network

61
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,910
or a new neural machine or whatever.

62
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:52,030
You always had to open a session and here as you can see we don't need it anymore.

63
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:52,590
And again.

64
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:58,740
So these are the main differences intensive flow 2.0 around the base acceptance of flow but we're going

65
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:02,770
to see that there are going to be more differences when building neural networks.

66
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:10,200
And by the way we will see if we use any session right then you have to know that you can also convert

67
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:13,440
an umpire right back to a sense of flow tensor as well.

68
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:20,520
And to illustrate this well here I introduced a new non pi array which I called non pi tensor and which

69
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,010
is the following num pi array.

70
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:28,230
Know this is the shortcut that we get known pi and P and this is the array function by Nan by 2 which

71
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:33,720
again you input the same you know the format with the double square brackets therefore giving you two

72
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,250
rows and two columns and then inside the values exactly the same.

73
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:44,130
Only this is and then by array and basically you can convert this name by Ray to tensor flow tensor

74
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:48,560
the following way by just calling your tensor flow library TAF.

75
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:54,270
And from which again you just take your constant function to which can put the number tensor.

76
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:54,630
Right.

77
00:04:54,630 --> 00:05:00,920
So into this constant function you only have two input you know the double square it's in your values

78
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,350
you can directly enter a non pirate.

79
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:09,740
And this will give you exactly the same meaning attentive look tensor but created from them by all rights

80
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,000
and then when you call it again.

81
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:16,850
Well you get this you know first some general information you know the fact that it is a tensor.

82
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:23,030
The idea is that just nine and fire the shape of your tensor two rows two columns the type of the values

83
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:28,510
inside your tensor which are integers and again the array with all the values.

84
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:28,850
All right.

85
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:33,720
So now it's much easier to play with constant tense of low constants.

86
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:37,850
And so there you go that's one of the new features of tension flow 2.0.

87
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:41,780
And now let's move on to the variables.

88
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,140
All right.

89
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:43,490
So for the variables.

90
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:48,800
Well first of all let's see how we define a variable and actually that's exactly the same.

91
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:55,040
You take your tensor flow library T F from what you call the variable class inside which will put the

92
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:58,660
shape with the double square brackets and the values inside.

93
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:05,120
And then when you want to get the values well you have two options either you just call UTF two variable

94
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:12,700
which as opposed to before won't only give you these informations but also the array with the values.

95
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,360
Right.

96
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:18,950
And then the second way to get the values of your variable of your tensor variable is to do the same.

97
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:24,860
You take your t f two variables that are tensor variable which we've just created and from which you

98
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:31,580
call the non pi function that was associated with tons of flow 2.0 in which directly gives you this

99
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:34,690
time only the array and also the type.

100
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:34,940
All right.

101
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:36,380
So much easier.

102
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:42,440
And now I'm just giving you an extra tool which you might use sometimes in your project and which is

103
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:47,870
something you do on a variable only of course because a constant cannot be changed its value.

104
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:53,120
So this is about changing a specific value in the variable like for example let's say you want to change

105
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:58,510
this cell here you know this value here in the first row and the third column.

106
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:03,740
Well to do so what you're going to do is take your variable get the first row which has index 0 and

107
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:11,660
get the third column which has index 2 and then you just add that and assign 100 sine this method of

108
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:17,120
the variable class which is exactly used to change any value you want inside your variable.

109
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:17,710
Right.

110
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:25,420
And therefore when we execute this well we get this with again the new information of your tensor and

111
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:31,940
inside the values and indeed three which was the cell before the first row and third column was replaced

112
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:33,150
by one hundred.

113
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:33,440
Right.

114
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,000
So good thing to know but once again you don't have to remember it.

115
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:41,720
We were giving you all the notebooks and and you know you can just keep them close to you on your computer

116
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:47,510
whenever you're working on a project so that you know you can quickly get access to a series of practical

117
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:50,040
functions to use with tons of load 2.0.

118
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:50,990
All right.

119
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:56,660
And then once again if we call the T F2 variable again we just get the same thing because indeed the

120
00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:01,610
assign replaces the cell you wanted to replace in that you have two variable.

121
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:03,710
So it's not like a new one is created.

122
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:08,300
Indeed the value was replacing in UTF 2 variable which we created before.

123
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:09,560
All right.

124
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:15,470
So now you clearly know the difference between tensor flow and intense flow two in terms of constants

125
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:16,470
and variables.

126
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:21,920
And now we're going to finish this section with the last story all where we will study how to do some

127
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:28,520
operations with tensor is it's actually not too different from 10 to 1 but I'm giving you some useful

128
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:33,290
tools and techniques that you can use with sense of flow 2.0 so that you can have a sense of flow 2.0

129
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:37,940
toolkit of the main things you can do with it still around the basics right.

130
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,490
Then we'll of course study neural networks and I'll give you much more tools related to artificial neural

131
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:44,400
networks.

132
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:49,920
So I'll see you in this next material to study all these operations with sensors.

133
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,980
And until then enjoy tons of low.
