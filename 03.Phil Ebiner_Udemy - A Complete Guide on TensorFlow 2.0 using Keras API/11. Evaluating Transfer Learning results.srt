Hello everyone and welcome to this exciting biking tutorial.

2
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:12,810
In the previous video we trained our transfer learning model and achieve almost 97 percent of our validation

3
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:21,180
data set which means that our model is nearly every time correct in recognizing cats and dogs but before

4
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:27,870
we did into the second part of this section fine tuning let's perform the final evaluation step of our

5
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:35,200
transfer learning model as you can see I prepared two very simple lines of code for this lesson.

6
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:44,140
The evaluation function always returns loss and accuracy as it did in the previous sections as well.

7
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:51,400
The only difference here is that we are using the function that can be fitted with data generator so

8
00:00:51,400 --> 00:01:01,600
instead of evaluate we are using evaluate generator provide valid generator to it executes excel and

9
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:04,780
we get ninety six point five percent.

10
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,600
That is fantastic results.

11
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:14,700
Guys we achieved almost state of the art results on these data stand in the next part of the section.

12
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:21,900
We are going to try to improve these results with a technique called fine tuning for now.

13
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:26,040
If you have any questions or comments please buzz them in the comments section.

14
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,350
Otherwise I'll assume the next tutorial.
