1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:01,060
All right.

2
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:09,210
We are about to find out about the accuracy on the evaluation set which is the relevant set on which

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,710
you assess the performance of your model.

4
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:12,030
Right.

5
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:18,450
Because the accuracy we got here where on the training set but the training set is where our model learns

6
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:23,730
as opposed to the evaluation set where the model hasn't learned at all.

7
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:29,520
So basically we're going to measure the performance on brand new observations which is of course much

8
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:32,250
more relevant than on the training set.

9
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:38,160
So first of all I'm going to show you the syntax that allows you to evaluate your model on the test

10
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:38,870
set.

11
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,370
Here is the syntax.

12
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:46,770
It is simply another method from the sequential class to evaluate the method that you call of course

13
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:50,640
from your model object in which takes of course as input.

14
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:58,560
The two arguments test and whitest right of course x test contains all your input the input images of

15
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:05,530
the set well formatted into you know the one dimensional vector fed into the neural network and why

16
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:08,390
test which contains the real values.

17
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,820
You know the real classes of each of the images in x test.

18
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:17,850
But of course the model is not going to look at why test the model is going to return the predictions

19
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:24,660
of X test and we're going to compare these predictions to whiteness to finally measure the ratio of

20
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:27,130
correct predictions in the test.

21
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:28,940
And just before we look at the results.

22
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:36,990
Well since the Evaluate method actually returns two elements which are first the loss incurred in the

23
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:42,810
test set by the predictions of the model and also the accuracy and that's exactly what we want you know

24
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:47,860
we will have a better idea of how well our mole performed by looking at the accuracy.

25
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,760
So since it returns these two elements.

26
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:55,820
Well that's why you have these two variables introduced here Teslas and test accuracy.

27
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:56,500
All right.

28
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:00,800
And now well let's have a look at the final result on the test set.

29
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:01,800
Here we go.

30
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:08,100
And the final result is a brilliant accuracy of 87 percent.

31
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:11,190
So the same as in the training set actually.

32
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:17,670
And that's probably thanks to this drop out layer because this drag layer was used to protect us from

33
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:20,970
overfishing you know to prevent overfishing from happening.

34
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:27,510
Meaning that indeed we still get a great accuracy on new observations which are the observations of

35
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:28,460
the test set.

36
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,700
You know maybe you can try.

37
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:36,330
Maybe if we didn't at this drop out layer Well we would have obtained a lower accuracy on the test set

38
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:43,000
and a higher accuracy on the training set because this is exactly a situation of overfishing.

39
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,790
So there you go.

40
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:48,740
You have a great accuracy here on 10000 observations.

41
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,710
And maybe now you can improve it.

42
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:57,420
That's of course going to be part of the exercises you'll have for this section and feel free to share

43
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:02,010
your results especially if you get for example some accuracy is over 90 percent.

44
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:06,600
We will be very curious to see the architecture you figure it out.

45
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:06,960
All right.

46
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,900
And you know that's the purpose of this course.

47
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:10,680
We give you the notebooks.

48
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,310
We explain everything in the notebooks and then it's your turn.

49
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:17,640
You have to practice on all the series of exercises we give you.

50
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:23,670
So really try to do the exercises following this section and it does matter if you don't figure out

51
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:25,170
all the solutions you know.

52
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:28,110
What matters is that you practice try try and try.

53
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,050
And that's how you improve your skills.

54
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,700
And of course if you find solutions well congratulations.

55
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:36,110
Share them in the Q and A that will help the other students.

56
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:41,670
You know this is also a community where you not only learn from me but also where you help each other

57
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:44,400
so communicate as much as you can.

58
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:49,500
We will be happy to have a very dynamic communication in this course.

59
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:49,820
All right.

60
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:54,900
So I also provided this Prince you know if you don't want all the different information including the

61
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,420
less what we really want indeed is the accuracy.

62
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:01,190
That's why I added this final print with a test accuracy.

63
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:07,950
And you know this format syntax to return the real value of the accuracy which is eighty seven point

64
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:09,740
four percent.

65
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:10,290
All right.

66
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:12,170
So now your turn.

67
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:19,260
Practice well and as soon as you feel that you get the skills in artificial neural networks well you'll

68
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:23,930
be ready to tackle the next section about convolution on all networks.

69
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:30,120
And that's where we'll learn how to build a convolution on the one network with tens of low 2.0.

70
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:33,150
So I look forward to seeing you in the next section.

71
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:36,380
And until then have fun on the exercises and enjoy tensor flow.
