Hello everyone and welcome to this python tutorial in the previous with you.

2
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:13,320
We try to improve our results after France for learning by applying the fine tuning technique but we

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:21,200
ended up getting even worse results than before our network overheated and we didn't have the opportunity

4
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:25,380
to improve previous results which is still fine.

5
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:31,550
We have achieved amazing results with the transfer learning step alone in some cases the transfer learning

6
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:38,180
step will produce better results and in other cases the fine tuning will achieve better results.

7
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:41,870
That really depends on the task itself and the model.

8
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:49,140
And basically our data set the goal of this video is to perform the evaluation step of our refined you

9
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:55,660
and model and to confirm results that we achieved in the previous video if you look at the code here

10
00:00:55,750 --> 00:01:01,110
it is the same code that we used in evaluation step of our transfer learning model.

11
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:05,350
The message here is changed but everything else stays the same.

12
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:11,950
Let's execute a cell then execute a second cell to print our results.

13
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:16,170
And as you can see we are getting ninety three point four percent.

14
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:22,800
The validation and accuracy we achieved during the fine tuning step is correct 1 and that's it for this

15
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,730
section.

16
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:28,120
If you have any questions or comments please post them in the comments section.

17
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,420
Otherwise I assume the next tutorial.
