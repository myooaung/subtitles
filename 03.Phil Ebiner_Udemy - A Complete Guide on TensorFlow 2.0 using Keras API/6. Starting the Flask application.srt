Hello everyone and welcome to this python tutorial in the previous video we defined our classified image

2
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:07,640
function.

3
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:14,740
And with that part we are done with our class code and in this video we are going to start our flask

4
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:18,150
server to start our flask application.

5
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:24,240
Write an app because that is our name that we defined of the flask application.

6
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:32,440
To run in these dot run function takes a few arguments let's check them.

7
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:36,670
The first argument is the host which is known by default.

8
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:43,770
If you're running these application or server you would need to specify the server IP here the port

9
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:46,820
is maybe the most important argument here.

10
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:54,520
This argument defines on which port this application will run if we said the port that is already occupied

11
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:56,510
by some other application.

12
00:00:56,650 --> 00:01:05,110
The flask ad will crash so at this stage it is essential to check whether or not the port is free.

13
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:09,000
You can overcome these by setting a board to be very high.

14
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:15,430
Let's say higher than 5000 and the last argument is debug.

15
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:23,510
If debug is set to None or fails the app will run in the production mode and all errors won't be printed

16
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,930
or the app won't stop since we are running this ad locally.

17
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:30,810
We won't provide the host.

18
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:36,060
So right port is equal to 5000 for a flat cap.

19
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:41,450
This is a default port to use but you can use any port that you want.

20
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:46,630
It only needs to be free if you are running this app on a server.

21
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:55,450
You would choose a port 80 or 88 for debug let's set it to false to test the application in the production

22
00:01:55,450 --> 00:02:00,490
mode select the line of the code and executed.

23
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:08,910
And as you can see the app is running on the port 5000 in the production environment and now it is everything

24
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:12,510
ready for us to send the first API request.

25
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:14,930
Stay tuned for that for now.

26
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:19,440
If you have any questions or comments please post them in the comments section.

27
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,780
Otherwise I assume the next tutorial.
