Hello, my name is Michael Hoffman.

2
00:00:02.855 --> 00:00:08.040
In this module I'll be demonstrating the first step for adding a

3
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.847
new feature to the JHipster generated project.

4
00:00:10.847 --> 00:00:15.237
I generated a project in the last module called patient portal.

5
00:00:15.237 --> 00:00:17.422
The business case is to allow patients to interact

6
00:00:17.422 --> 00:00:19.056
with their physicians in a practice.

7
00:00:19.056 --> 00:00:22.009
Eventually this is going to be a full functioning application,

8
00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:25.776
but to start with I just want a feature that allows

9
00:00:25.776 --> 00:00:27.814
patients to manage their appointments.

10
00:00:27.814 --> 00:00:31.875
In this module, we will be focusing on the first step for this new feature.

11
00:00:31.875 --> 00:00:35.066
I need a user to be able to log in to the application.

12
00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:36.776
The user is a patient in the practice,

13
00:00:36.776 --> 00:00:39.549
and they're going to need to enter login information,

14
00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:42.032
including their username and password,

15
00:00:42.032 --> 00:00:45.677
to gain access to the authenticated portion of the website.

16
00:00:45.677 --> 00:00:46.944
As we continue in the course,

17
00:00:46.944 --> 00:00:49.992
we will add the ability for this logged in patient to

18
00:00:49.992 --> 00:00:52.258
request appointments with their physician.

19
00:00:52.258 --> 00:00:55.781
We will also add the ability for the patient to view the

20
00:00:55.781 --> 00:00:57.082
appointment requests that they've made.

21
00:00:57.082 --> 00:01:04.000
Before we can start working on patient login, let's get the application server started.
