00:00:02,396 --> 00:00:03,074
In this module,

2
00:00:03,074 --> 00:00:07,374
we saw how easy it is to get JHipster up and running on your work station.

3
00:00:07,374 --> 00:00:10,152
I covered the prerequisites to this course.

4
00:00:10,152 --> 00:00:14,669
You're going to need Java 8, Git, Gradle, an IDE, Node.

5
00:00:14,669 --> 00:00:17,967
js, and Yarn, to install the JHipster generator.

6
00:00:17,967 --> 00:00:18,260
Next,

7
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:20,892
I provided the demonstration of the commands that are

8
00:00:20,892 --> 00:00:24,900
needed to leverage Yarn for installing the Yeoman tool

9
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,758
and JHipster generator packages.

10
00:00:26,758 --> 00:00:33,000
Now that the generator is installed, the next step I'll cover is creation of a project.
