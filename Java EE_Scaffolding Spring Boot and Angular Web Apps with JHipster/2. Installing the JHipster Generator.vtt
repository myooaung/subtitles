1
00:00:02.656 --> 00:00:05.752
I'm going to demonstrate the installation and verification of the

2
00:00:05.752 --> 00:00:09.577
JHipster generator for a command line interface.

3
00:00:09.577 --> 00:00:12.585
You should have installed the prerequisites especially Yarn,

4
00:00:12.585 --> 00:00:17.038
as it's going to be leveraged to retrieve the necessary packages.

5
00:00:17.038 --> 00:00:20.651
First, Yarn will be used to retrieve the Yeoman scaffolding tool.

6
00:00:20.651 --> 00:00:22.598
As I mentioned earlier in the course,

7
00:00:22.598 --> 00:00:25.740
JHipster is a generator that's based on the Yeoman tool.

8
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.964
With Yeoman installed, I'll again use Yarn to retrieve the JHipster generator.

9
00:00:30.964 --> 00:00:34.808
While this course, and JHipster are operating system agnostic,

10
00:00:34.808 --> 00:00:38.200
I'll be leveraging Windows PowerShell for the demonstration.

11
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.841
Let's look at the commands that will be used in the demo.

12
00:00:41.841 --> 00:00:45.967
I'll start the demonstration by running the yarn version command.

13
00:00:45.967 --> 00:00:48.722
This is just a check to verify that Yarn is installed correctly,

14
00:00:48.722 --> 00:00:50.518
and with the right version.

15
00:00:50.518 --> 00:00:54.110
Next, I'll run the command, yarn global add yo.

16
00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.468
This installs the latest Yeoman package globally,

17
00:00:57.468 --> 00:01:00.777
making it available across projects.

18
00:01:00.777 --> 00:01:03.268
Next, I'll run the command, yo --version,

19
00:01:03.268 --> 00:01:06.207
which will verify that Yeoman installed correctly.

20
00:01:06.207 --> 00:01:11.303
The last installation command is yarn global add generator-jhipster.

21
00:01:11.303 --> 00:01:11.945
Again,

22
00:01:11.945 --> 00:01:17.124
this is installing at a global level so that the JHipster

23
00:01:17.124 --> 00:01:18.988
generator is available across projects.

24
00:01:18.988 --> 00:01:23.135
Finally, I'll execute the command, yo jhipster.

25
00:01:23.135 --> 00:01:26.174
This runs the Yeoman tool using the JHipster generator,

26
00:01:26.174 --> 00:01:28.896
and verifies the installation.

27
00:01:28.896 --> 00:01:31.619
Let's start the demo.

28
00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:32.793
I've opened up Windows PowerShell.

29
00:01:32.793 --> 00:01:35.898
Since we're going to be installing Yeoman and JHipster globally,

30
00:01:35.898 --> 00:01:40.085
I don't really care so much about what folder I am in.

31
00:01:40.085 --> 00:01:43.513
I've started out on the dev folder of the C drive.

32
00:01:43.513 --> 00:01:47.295
The first command I'm going to run Is yarn's base version.

33
00:01:47.295 --> 00:01:51.615
This is verifying that the Yarn package manager is installed correctly.

34
00:01:51.615 --> 00:01:53.707
I see it's at version 0.

35
00:01:53.707 --> 00:01:54.055
27.

36
00:01:54.055 --> 00:01:56.844
5, and I also see an error message.

37
00:01:56.844 --> 00:01:58.672
You can safely ignore that error message,

38
00:01:58.672 --> 00:02:00.823
it's just simply saying that there's no package.

39
00:02:00.823 --> 00:02:02.233
json file in this folder,

40
00:02:02.233 --> 00:02:05.558
and we really don't care because it's not our project folder.

41
00:02:05.558 --> 00:02:08.484
I'm going to continue on now to install Yeoman.

42
00:02:08.484 --> 00:02:14.116
To install Yeoman, I need to run the command, yarn global add yo.

43
00:02:14.116 --> 00:02:19.312
Now your installation may take a little longer,

44
00:02:19.312 --> 00:02:21.862
I've of course fast forwarded to the success message,

45
00:02:21.862 --> 00:02:26.712
but we see the success message saying that we installed Yeoman correctly.

46
00:02:26.712 --> 00:02:28.133
We installed version 2.

47
00:02:28.133 --> 00:02:28.488
0.

48
00:02:28.488 --> 00:02:37.481
0, but we also want to verify it, so I'm going to run the command yo --version.

49
00:02:37.481 --> 00:02:40.391
And that gives me back the version number as 2.

50
00:02:40.391 --> 00:02:40.682
0.

51
00:02:40.682 --> 00:02:41.846
0, which we expected.

52
00:02:41.846 --> 00:02:45.812
So now that Yeoman's installed, I can install the JHipster generator.

53
00:02:45.812 --> 00:02:55.011
To do that, I'm going to run the command, yarn global add generator-jhipster.

54
00:02:55.011 --> 00:02:57.611
So once again I fast forwarded it through the installation,

55
00:02:57.611 --> 00:02:59.668
but we again see a success message.

56
00:02:59.668 --> 00:03:04.574
It says that installed generator-jhipster with version 4.

57
00:03:04.574 --> 00:03:05.187
6.

58
00:03:05.187 --> 00:03:05.800
2.

59
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.361
So if I installed this correctly, I should be able to run the command,

60
00:03:09.361 --> 00:03:10.738
yo jhipster.

61
00:03:10.738 --> 00:03:14.179
And there we have it.

62
00:03:14.179 --> 00:03:16.082
If everything was installed successfully,

63
00:03:16.082 --> 00:03:19.423
you'll see the ASCII of the JHipster generator.

64
00:03:19.423 --> 00:03:23.069
An important note here, the JHipster generator gets updated actively,

65
00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:26.334
so it's likely that you may be warned of an available JHipster

66
00:03:26.334 --> 00:03:28.277
upgrade as you continue with the course.

67
00:03:28.277 --> 00:03:32.852
It's safe to upgrade, there's no major releases that are planned at this time.

68
00:03:32.852 --> 00:03:39.000
This concludes the demo, and let's look at some additional JHipster installation details.
