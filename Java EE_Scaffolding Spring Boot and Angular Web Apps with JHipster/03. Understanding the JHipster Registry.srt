1
00:00:01,888 --> 00:00:04,027
After entering your application meta data,

2
00:00:04,027 --> 00:00:07,484
the JHipster generator will prompt you as to whether or not

3
00:00:07,484 --> 00:00:09,573
you want to use the JHipster registry.

4
00:00:09,573 --> 00:00:12,077
You might be wondering just what this is.

5
00:00:12,077 --> 00:00:14,560
The JHipster registry is a separate application from the

6
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,168
scaffolding that we're generating.

7
00:00:16,168 --> 00:00:20,275
The application implements the microservices pattern named service registry.

8
00:00:20,275 --> 00:00:22,633
Now you might be wondering,

9
00:00:22,633 --> 00:00:26,419
why would I need a service registry for a monolithic application.

10
00:00:26,419 --> 00:00:30,101
The JHipster registry functions as a Spring Cloud Config server,

11
00:00:30,101 --> 00:00:34,418
so you can centralize runtime configurations using it.

12
00:00:34,418 --> 00:00:36,758
The registry also functions as an administration server,

13
00:00:36,758 --> 00:00:39,982
so you can gain the benefits of viewing metrics,

14
00:00:39,982 --> 00:00:42,805
monitoring the application, and performing management tasks.

15
00:00:42,805 --> 00:00:46,250
If you don't have existing tools to support these features,

16
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:49,211
you may want to consider the JHipster registry as an option.

17
00:00:49,211 --> 00:00:55,128
You can find more about the registry application at jhipster.

18
00:00:55,128 --> 00:00:56,364
github.

19
00:00:56,364 --> 00:00:57,599
io/jhipster-registry.

20
00:00:57,599 --> 00:01:01,106
I won't be selecting support for the JHipster registry in this course,

21
00:01:01,106 --> 00:01:05,718
so let's respond with that decision now.

22
00:01:05,718 --> 00:01:08,058
I've again opened Windows PowerShell with the

23
00:01:08,058 --> 00:01:09,729
current step of project generation.

24
00:01:09,729 --> 00:01:11,903
So we keep focus on the scaffolding regenerating,

25
00:01:11,903 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm going to select No for JHipster registry. Now that that decision is made, let's continue to security.
