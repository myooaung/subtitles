1
00:00:02,372 --> 00:00:04,413
In the next step of the generation process,

2
00:00:04,413 --> 00:00:07,296
JHipster allows you to make a decision on other technologies

3
00:00:07,296 --> 00:00:10,134
that you'd like to include in the scaffolding.

4
00:00:10,134 --> 00:00:14,849
This is sort of a catch all bucket for common dependencies.

5
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:17,344
We aren't going to select these options so that we can

6
00:00:17,344 --> 00:00:18,896
keep focused on the main scaffolding,

7
00:00:18,896 --> 00:00:22,303
but you may want to explore these options in case they

8
00:00:22,303 --> 00:00:25,529
are of use to you for your application.

9
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:26,995
First, we have social login.

10
00:00:26,995 --> 00:00:30,664
This gives you the ability to authenticate users from Google,

11
00:00:30,664 --> 00:00:33,527
Facebook, or Twitter, using Spring Social.

12
00:00:33,527 --> 00:00:37,587
Elasticsearch gives you support for a search engine

13
00:00:37,587 --> 00:00:39,617
via Spring Data Elasticsearch.

14
00:00:39,617 --> 00:00:44,214
Hazelcast supports clustering your HTTP session for storing Spring

15
00:00:44,214 --> 00:00:47,873
Security authentication and authorization information.

16
00:00:47,873 --> 00:00:51,447
WebSocket gives you support for WebSockets through

17
00:00:51,447 --> 00:00:53,489
the Spring WebSocket's library.

18
00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:59,001
Finally, Apache Kafka provides you with a published subscribe message broker.

19
00:00:59,001 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm going to just hit Enter to continue to the next selection. Next, I'll cover the decision for a client-side framework.
