Hello, my name is Michael Hoffman,

2
00:00:03.072 --> 00:00:08.590
in this module I'll demonstrate project creation using the JHipster generator.

3
00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:12.117
As the generator is going to prompt you for decisions on what you want created,

4
00:00:12.117 --> 00:00:15.352
the goal of this module is for you to understand the impact

5
00:00:15.352 --> 00:00:18.247
of these decisions on the final product.

6
00:00:18.247 --> 00:00:22.567
JHipster makes many decisions on the scaffolding for you, but not all of them.

7
00:00:22.567 --> 00:00:25.827
The tool gives you the opportunity to choose from different

8
00:00:25.827 --> 00:00:28.411
options around several key decisions.

9
00:00:28.411 --> 00:00:31.888
First, you'll need to define your application meta data.

10
00:00:31.888 --> 00:00:34.864
You'll be able to select the type of application you want,

11
00:00:34.864 --> 00:00:39.097
enter the application name, and enter the application package name.

12
00:00:39.097 --> 00:00:42.323
Next, you need to decide on your method for authentication.

13
00:00:42.323 --> 00:00:46.399
You'll be able to select between stateful and stateless options.

14
00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:51.434
Then, you'll need to tell JHipster what type of database you're planning to use.

15
00:00:51.434 --> 00:00:55.785
JHipster supports both SQL and NoSQL database types.

16
00:00:55.785 --> 00:00:56.085
Next,

17
00:00:56.085 --> 00:01:00.551
you'll get to select between Gradle and Maven as your server-side build tool.

18
00:01:00.551 --> 00:01:05.157
Then, you need to select the client-side framework for your application.

19
00:01:05.157 --> 00:01:09.293
You'll have the option of choosing the Angular version 4 framework,

20
00:01:09.293 --> 00:01:12.575
or the Angular JS version 1 framework.

21
00:01:12.575 --> 00:01:12.852
Finally,

22
00:01:12.852 --> 00:01:16.620
you can choose additional test libraries on top of the unit test

23
00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.614
frameworks that JHipster provides by default.

24
00:01:19.614 --> 00:01:20.305
Given this list,

25
00:01:20.305 --> 00:01:23.242
you should have some confidence that JHipster is covering all of

26
00:01:23.242 --> 00:01:26.160
these important facets of the project for you.

27
00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:32.000
Now let's start up our command line session, and see how the generator creates a project.
