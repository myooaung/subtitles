WEBVTT
1
00:00:02.113 --> 00:00:05.117
I've opened up PowerShell to the project folder.

2
00:00:05.117 --> 00:00:07.928
In the previous module, I showed you how to run webpack,

3
00:00:07.928 --> 00:00:09.532
which we're going to do here again.

4
00:00:09.532 --> 00:00:11.211
If you already have a server started,

5
00:00:11.211 --> 00:00:13.956
make sure to shut it down before you proceed.

6
00:00:13.956 --> 00:00:15.507
Let's run webpack for development.

7
00:00:15.507 --> 00:00:18.940
I'm going to run the command yarn start.

8
00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:24.247
I fast forwarded through the execution of the command,

9
00:00:24.247 --> 00:00:27.905
we see the line that webpack compiled successfully,

10
00:00:27.905 --> 00:00:31.163
and next I want you to look at three lines of this log.

11
00:00:31.163 --> 00:00:38.924
First, the line that says Proxying, and includes the URL of localhost:9060.

12
00:00:38.924 --> 00:00:44.166
The next line is Local, and this again has localhost as the URL,

13
00:00:44.166 --> 00:00:46.820
this time it has a port of 9000.

14
00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.968
The third line to note is the UI line, which has localhost again,

15
00:00:51.968 --> 00:00:55.460
but this time a port of 3001.

16
00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.587
What do these mean?

17
00:00:57.587 --> 00:01:01.842
Let's look at the webpack scripts to understand.

18
00:01:01.842 --> 00:01:04.965
JHipster has defined two scripts here.

19
00:01:04.965 --> 00:01:08.089
The first one is for start.

20
00:01:08.089 --> 00:01:11.614
This is going to run webpack in development mode.

21
00:01:11.614 --> 00:01:15.120
Next, note the script for webpack:dev.

22
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.139
This runs the dev server and passes several options in.

23
00:01:19.139 --> 00:01:21.378
These options include specifying the file where

24
00:01:21.378 --> 00:01:26.077
webpack development is configured, and hot code replacement.

25
00:01:26.077 --> 00:01:30.881
What we want to focus on here is the port option specified as 9060.

26
00:01:30.881 --> 00:01:35.650
This is the port that tells webpack where to listen for requests on.

27
00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.008
So this tells us what port webpack is listening on,

28
00:01:38.008 --> 00:01:39.467
but what were those other ports?

29
00:01:39.467 --> 00:01:43.375
Let's take a look at one of the key sections of the webpack.

30
00:01:43.375 --> 00:01:43.950
dev.

31
00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.977
js file, noted here in the options.

32
00:01:47.977 --> 00:01:49.587
So in the file webpack.

33
00:01:49.587 --> 00:01:49.909
dev.

34
00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:54.043
js, found in the webpack folder off of the root of the project,

35
00:01:54.043 --> 00:01:56.223
you're going to find a plugin section.

36
00:01:56.223 --> 00:01:59.435
Here is where the BrowserSyncPlugin has been defined.

37
00:01:59.435 --> 00:02:02.424
BrowserSync automatically synchronizes your browser file with

38
00:02:02.424 --> 00:02:05.532
project file changes so that you don't have to keep refreshing

39
00:02:05.532 --> 00:02:08.397
the page for every change that you make.

40
00:02:08.397 --> 00:02:13.210
What's happening here is JHipster defined a proxy on the BrowserSyncPlugin.

41
00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.169
This proxied the output from the webpack development

42
00:02:16.169 --> 00:02:18.019
server through a browser sync.

43
00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:22.606
Note that port 9000 is defined, and is the port that you access the client from.

44
00:02:22.606 --> 00:02:26.997
In the console output, you saw a URL with port 3001.

45
00:02:26.997 --> 00:02:31.673
If you navigated to that URL, you'll reach the BrowserSync management page.

46
00:02:31.673 --> 00:02:34.932
So now you can see how JHipster has generated code to support

47
00:02:34.932 --> 00:02:38.159
development and hot reload of resources.

48
00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:41.575
This is a very beneficial feature for supporting faster development,

49
00:02:41.575 --> 00:02:44.936
and it comes enabled out of the box.

50
00:02:44.936 --> 00:02:48.717
Let's open up the browser to see the client.

51
00:02:48.717 --> 00:02:53.496
I've opened up a browser and the first tab is showing the URL localhost:9000.

52
00:02:53.496 --> 00:02:56.400
This was our landing page.

53
00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.303
Let me refresh the page.

54
00:02:59.303 --> 00:03:01.851
Note here on refresh that you saw a message in the upper-right

55
00:03:01.851 --> 00:03:05.027
corner that said Connected to BrowserSync.

56
00:03:05.027 --> 00:03:06.395
That means when changes are made,

57
00:03:06.395 --> 00:03:09.147
we're going to automatically have them synced in the browser.

58
00:03:09.147 --> 00:03:13.442
I have a second tab open, let me open that now,

59
00:03:13.442 --> 00:03:17.623
and the URL here is localhost:3001.

60
00:03:17.623 --> 00:03:19.850
This is just a management tool for BrowserSync,

61
00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:23.867
and it's going to provide you features such as reloading all of your browsers,

62
00:03:23.867 --> 00:03:26.385
and opening up the application directly.

63
00:03:26.385 --> 00:03:26.804
Next,

64
00:03:26.804 --> 00:03:35.000
let's get a basic understanding of the client structure that was generated before we start coding.
