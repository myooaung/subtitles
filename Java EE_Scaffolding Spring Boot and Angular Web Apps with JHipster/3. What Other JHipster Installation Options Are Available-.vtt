00:00:02.489 --> 00:00:06.085
In this course, I focused on the installation option that's the most common.

2
00:00:06.085 --> 00:00:10.628
However, there are two other approaches that you can use.

3
00:00:10.628 --> 00:00:14.410
First, JHipster provides a virtual machine as a vagrant box.

4
00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:16.066
This includes all the necessary tooling,

5
00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:18.996
and some additional development tools like Docker.

6
00:00:18.996 --> 00:00:20.573
Speaking of which,

7
00:00:20.573 --> 00:00:23.594
JHipster also provides a Docker image to run the

8
00:00:23.594 --> 00:00:25.291
JHipster generator inside a container.

9
00:00:25.291 --> 00:00:27.686
This approach has some complexity to it,

10
00:00:27.686 --> 00:00:30.569
so evaluate carefully whether you need this option.

11
00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:31.724
As JHipster evolves,

12
00:00:31.724 --> 00:00:36.147
I plan to continue updating a GitHub project with helpful installation details.

13
00:00:36.147 --> 00:00:38.784
You can find the project at github.

14
00:00:38.784 --> 00:00:39.409
com/michaelhoffmantech.

15
00:00:39.409 --> 00:00:43.266
For the latest information on installation steps,

16
00:00:43.266 --> 00:00:47.363
it's also recommended to check the JHipster website directly,

17
00:00:47.363 --> 00:00:48.885
at jhipster.

18
00:00:48.885 --> 00:00:49.646
github.

19
00:00:49.646 --> 00:00:50.407
io.

20
00:00:50.407 --> 00:00:52.764
Along with the installation of the JHipster generator,

21
00:00:52.764 --> 00:00:56.196
JHipster provides an additional sub generator for creating

22
00:00:56.196 --> 00:00:58.983
entities and relationships inside a project.

23
00:00:58.983 --> 00:01:02.410
These assets are defined by a domain-specific language,

24
00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:03.776
that's specific to JHipster.

25
00:01:03.776 --> 00:01:06.753
While it's outside of the scope for this course,

26
00:01:06.753 --> 00:01:09.688
the JHipster DSL tooling can be a useful option for

27
00:01:09.688 --> 00:01:17.000
code generation post project creation. Let's summarize what we covered in this module.
