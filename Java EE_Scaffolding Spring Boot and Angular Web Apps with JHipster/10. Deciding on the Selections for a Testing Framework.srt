1
00:00:02,026 --> 00:00:05,116
The next decision that JHipster presents you with is to select

2
00:00:05,116 --> 00:00:08,128
one or more options for test frameworks.

3
00:00:08,128 --> 00:00:11,607
By default, JHipster will provide you with support for JUnit,

4
00:00:11,607 --> 00:00:14,044
to code and execute unit tests for Java,

5
00:00:14,044 --> 00:00:17,610
and Karma to code and run your JavaScript unit tests.

6
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:22,098
The selections shown are in addition to these default frameworks.

7
00:00:22,098 --> 00:00:28,298
Gatling provides support for load and performance testing of web applications.

8
00:00:28,298 --> 00:00:31,732
Cucumber provides support for automated testing of web

9
00:00:31,732 --> 00:00:34,813
applications using a behavior driven approach.

10
00:00:34,813 --> 00:00:39,995
Protractor provides support for end to end testing of Angular applications.

11
00:00:39,995 --> 00:00:44,566
It acts as more as an integration test framework when compared to Karma.

12
00:00:44,566 --> 00:00:47,630
Given its availability from Angular, and it's feature set,

13
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:50,974
this is a framework that I've found myself selecting for scaffolding,

14
00:00:50,974 --> 00:00:54,075
therefore, I'm going to select it now.

15
00:00:54,075 --> 00:00:56,770
Selecting Protractor as a test framework will result in both

16
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:58,353
the generation of protractor configuration,

17
00:00:58,353 --> 00:01:03,223
and the generation of end to end tests for several of the features.

18
00:01:03,223 --> 00:01:04,867
Along with these end to end tests,

19
00:01:04,867 --> 00:01:15,000
JHipster will also generate JUnit and Karma unit tests for the default features. Let's look at the final step around the JHipster marketplace.
