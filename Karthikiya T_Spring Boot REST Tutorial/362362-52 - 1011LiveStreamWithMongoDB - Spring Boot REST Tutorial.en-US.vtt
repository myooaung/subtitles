00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.070
It's also quickly talk about the solar side events and stream the data live.

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:09.540
So we have this method that will do that job.

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.580
So I'm trying to retrieve all the products with the delay off one second.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:15.510
And,

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:16.020
of course,

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.130
in order for that to work,

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.850
you have to had this attribute.

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:25.770
Let's go to browser and trying to see how it functions.

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:27.660
So everyone second,

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.470
you see the data getting populated.

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.510
But one thing to note here is that by default,

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.150
this is not an infinite stream.

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:40.290
That means you won't see data getting populated as and when the new data gets added into

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.080
the database in order for that to work.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.750
If you want us to be an infinite stream,

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:53.540
that means someone will push the data continuously as and when the data is available to the

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:54.050
client.

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.120
Then you have to use so called a available cars ER,

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.050
which is a concept off mongo DB.

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.340
And in order for Dr Work,

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.470
you have to create so called a capped collection and you won't be able to create a capped

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.620
collection with an embedded mongo database.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:16.130
You have to have an extra manga database where you're able to access its console and run

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:17.040
some commands.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.160
So for that reason,

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.510
I can or demonstrated that feature at the moment.

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:26.010
But I'm just trying to say that it is possible that to see the data re alive as and when

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:27.950
the data is created on the database sent,

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.800
I hope it makes sense.
