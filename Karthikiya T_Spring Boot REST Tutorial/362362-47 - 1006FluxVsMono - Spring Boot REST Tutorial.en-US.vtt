00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.700
Let's try to understand the difference between flocks and more.

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:04.050
No.

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:05.970
If you want to return a result set,

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.140
which will have multiple elements,

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:09.700
then you would use flux.

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:14.970
If you just have one element to be returned or if you have only one result,

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:16.540
then you would use model.

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:19.250
Let's go there clips and try to understand the same.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:27.980
So in here flux would make more sense because we're trying to return list off products.

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.110
But let's say I wonder it on the count,

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:33.180
for instance,

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.460
in this case,

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.750
I'm just returning one result.

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.450
Someone would make more sense.

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:50.360
You might be wondering.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.740
Flux is going to return more than one element anyway,

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:55.670
So why can't you just use flux?

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:56.330
Well,

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.480
the answer is the client might be expecting with one element.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.850
If you're using flux as Origen type,

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.880
then there is a possibility off returning more than one element.

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:09.500
Using one would ensure that will have only one result of Britain.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.400
That's right,

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.350
not application.

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:29.650
Let's send the request and regard the response
