00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.150
Let's take a look at how we can create a resource with post request.

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.860
First,

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:10.690
let's created matter in our intra fess and here it is.

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:12.920
It's not going to written anything,

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:18.550
but it's going to take in these perimeters which will help us create a product.

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.360
And here is implementation for the same.

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.250
All I'm trying to do is to add a new product.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:32.200
But taking in all those arguments an insider controller,

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:37.000
I went into juice and method with post mapping.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.250
So all the yesterday people streak was would end up in here.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:48.430
This method is going to take in three para meters and these are essentially the request

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.250
para meters that we would send from the client.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.530
This is as good as receiving the form.

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:04.120
Enter data from declined and all we're trying to do here is to create a product.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:09.180
We're just calling one of the service methods nor to create a resource.

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.850
In addition to that,

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:16.380
we also want to send some status back to the client so that the user would be aware that

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.950
the resource has been created.

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:23.150
So for that I created a map with string as a key,

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.470
an object as value.

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.420
I'm trying to populate one off the map elements,

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.350
which I'm sending back as a response.

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:36.090
And all these map entries in this case is just one would be rendered as Jason response on

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.000
the client machine.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.150
So let's take a look at how we can send post request from our client.

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:53.950
So this time going to chose post and I'm going to go to body dab and click on form data.

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.750
So this is essentially going to simulate submitting a form from the Broza.

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:10.850
So we need to send this perimeters I d name and price with the exact same name I d.

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.970
Name and price.

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.050
That is going to be a unique value.

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.820
How's therefore name is going to be,

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:30.020
maybe washing machine or whatever price,

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.100
some random number.

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.050
Let's try sending the request.

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.940
Okay.

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:42.640
We seem to be having problem because we're trying to upend this para meter.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.650
Let's get rid off it and send the request once again.

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.030
Oops.

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.880
I completely forgot the fact that went to restart our application.

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:58.690
Sorry about that.

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.220
And let's go back and send the request once again.

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.450
And this time it worked pretty well.

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.530
So that's how you would send a post request.

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.860
You know,

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:14.050
next example will take a look at how we can send Jason as an input as part of the request.
