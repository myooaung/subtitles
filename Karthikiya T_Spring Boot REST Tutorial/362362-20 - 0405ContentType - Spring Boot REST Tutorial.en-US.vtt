00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.060
just as a silver is able to respond back with data.

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:09.760
And where is different formats or media types meant Lankans and data invaders,

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.350
different formats and several must be able to receive and process it.

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:18.570
One of the cases where this might happen he's been client is trying to aid their update or

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:19.770
creative resource.

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:26.920
So let's tried updating existing resource going to go the Postman.

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:32.570
And he wrote the list of products available under the spare in XML format who into copy one

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:41.470
off these because I want up that this particular record change the method to put inside the

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:42.110
body.

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.970
I want to change this to something else,

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:58.700
whatever and if I tried to send the request going to see another says the content type not

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.380
supported the real cause off.

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:09.110
This error is that so is notable to pick the right converter to convert the XML into Java

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:09.750
objects.

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:17.310
So plan has to specify the type off content it is trying to send by adding one additional

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.780
header.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:24.690
Could the name content type and then you were specified,

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.550
the type of content you're trying to send?

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.650
Not this time it worked
