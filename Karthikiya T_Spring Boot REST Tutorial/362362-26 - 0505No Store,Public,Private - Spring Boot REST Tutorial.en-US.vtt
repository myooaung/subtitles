00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.930
I was mentioning before that we should not be storing literally all the resources in all

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:07.750
the cash members that come away.

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:08.990
In some cases,

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:13.050
it may not be ideal to even store the resources and cache memory,

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:17.640
while in some cases it might be okayed a store on the client machine,

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.050
but not on any intermediate nodes.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:20.780
Well,

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:25.150
the way you control that is about using these response headers.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.250
If you're setting the cash control to know store,

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:35.210
then that means we're not going to store any off the response data in any off the cache

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:35.890
memories.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:42.920
This may be true in case if we're performing any banking transactions where the information

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.150
that is being exchanged,

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.880
maybe too personal to store them in the cache memory.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.550
If you made the cash control toe public,

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:57.700
then that means we can store that resource in all the cash memories,

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:05.320
not only in decline Mission but can also be in any intermediate note like CD in a proxy

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:06.450
server was etcetera.

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.740
If you said the cash control toe private,

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:16.140
then that means we only want to store them on the client machine and not on any

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.650
intermediate notes.

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:25.130
This may be applicable in case off e commerce websites where maybe you're adding certain

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:26.990
products into your cart,

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:33.530
and it may not be ideal to store all those product details in some common server and only

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.080
store in the client's machine.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.950
So that's how you control how we're going to store the data.

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.760
Hope it makes sense.
