00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.850
Let's take a look at how we can delete a resource using rest template.

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:07.870
So here inside Web service one.

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:09.330
We have a delete method,

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.080
which will help us delete a product from the list off available products.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.770
And this matter is going to accept one part variable,

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:20.800
which will be bottled the ur itself.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.310
And inside here we're trying to delete a specific product by a identifier.

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.750
And then we're trying to populate the map with the status,

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.070
which will send as a response as well,

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:40.780
from inside Web service to we have a delete product method,

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.150
which is also going to accept the part variable.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:48.340
And I'm just trying to con cabinet the product idea,

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.550
along with the Ural that will be using to send the request.

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.290
Finally,

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:55.940
I'm using the exchange matter off rest,

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.880
template and spurs federal.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:58.920
This perimeters,

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.750
along with the deal it method in order to send the request and delayed the product.

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.950
And since this method is responding back with the map,

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.450
I'm trying to get the map as the response here and this morning back with the same.

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.050
So here are the list of products available.

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:24.240
Now let's try toe delayed this specific product from the list from Web service to which is

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.700
running in Port 80 81.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.580
I already have everything set up,

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:41.700
have chosen the dilate method along with the your and it seemed to have worked.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.140
Product was deleted and sure enough,

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:45.510
it did.

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:51.440
So depending on your requirements.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.650
Huge.

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.050
Understand what develop services,

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.580
accepting what kind of para meters,

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:57.390
where is it written value,

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.170
etcetera and based on that,

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:06.470
he can use the methods available inside the rest template in order to send the request and

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:07.930
come and get with other more.

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.960
Jill's hope it makes sense.
