00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.960
Let's take a look at how we can implement Ha Dios in dressed FBI.

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:08.110
We may be having a poor Joe that looks something like this.

00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:10.670
This is very simple and straightforward.

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:15.850
We just have a constructor that would populate all the fields and we have bunch of garrison

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:18.860
centers that correspond to these fields.

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:21.790
If Civil War to respond back with this resource,

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:27.440
then this is how it would be represented in Jason format without all the links that were

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:28.410
talked about.

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.530
If you want the neighborhood Theo's and include all those links to help the client

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:34.180
application,

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.280
I've get through all the list off actions that it can take.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.340
We have to include heartiest library in the class part,

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.380
and we have Springwood started dependency for the same.

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:49.910
So you have to include the stag as part off the bomb that XML and Christopher,

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.840
using maven and for whichever resource you want add links to you have to extend that poor

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.790
Joe with this class called resource support.

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:04.400
This class has matters to help us add those additional links and in order to add those

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.750
links in dynamic manner,

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:11.020
we're going to be using controlling build a class We're going to take a look at an example

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.950
in the next slide and then you'll have a better picture on the same.

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.570
So what are the text that you're seeing in it?

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.230
The blue or red is the additional court,

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:20.000
I added,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.050
in order to introduce adios feature.

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:28.250
The first and foremost thing is that I've extended the class with resource support,

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:34.010
which comes with this method ad which will help me add a link Object.

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.930
Now,

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.070
when you're designing the application,

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:42.530
you have to sit and discuss what are all the possible outcomes and water all relevant for

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:43.360
your needs.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:44.230
In my case,

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:47.710
I know the fact that whenever I'm responding back with a product,

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.480
here are the list off actions that I would expect the client to perform,

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:56.020
like the late update taking a look at reviews,

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.750
etcetera.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.200
You can also apply conditions if you wish.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.320
For example,

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.860
maybe I would like to disable delete if it is customer who logs in.

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.960
So maybe I would have a conditional check to check the authentication,

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.090
and based on that,

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.450
I would either at this link are not at this link.

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.650
Whatever the test that is highlighted in dread,

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:23.950
is bad practice because what we're trying to do is we're trying to add the link object by

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.000
hardcore in the U.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.550
R I.

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.960
There isn't why this is a problem is because at later point off time,

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.550
our mapping annotation can change and the link would no longer work.

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:35.990
Instead,

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:40.440
we want to use the class controller linked builder,

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.100
which has bunch of static method like linked to methadone,

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.890
etcetera,

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.510
to help us dynamically populate the links.

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.070
For example,

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:55.900
this instruction right here would allow us to press the value off the mapping annotation

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.300
that corresponds to the delete product method,

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.770
off part controller class and with relation to lead.

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:08.900
Let me explain this in more detail fashion so as you that we have the controller with the

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.960
falling because mapping and inside this controller,

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:16.490
we may be having a delete method with the following mapping.

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:22.220
So using linked to mattered would help us call the matter off this controller,

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:23.420
whatever the controller.

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.560
But she's specifying here and by doing so,

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:32.330
Spring is actually going to take care of dynamically pulling out the request mapping

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.280
information from here and would respond back with the same.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.480
This is equal in tow.

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.410
We hardcore in the link in this manner and ultimate Jason result for both off.

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.750
These is going to look something like this.

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.800
So it's always better to use this approach so that in future,

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.550
if you change us to something else,

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:57.410
it's not going to impact anything so likewise have popular all the links.

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:00.020
And whenever this resource is requested,

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:01.380
I'm in the product.

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.980
Spring is actually going to take care off,

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:10.570
wrapping departed content with all these link objects which will be used by the plaint in

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:12.880
order to perform various actions.

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.150
So ultimately,

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:17.820
the Jason responds this time,

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.480
after we added all that code would look something like this,

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.060
which is what I'm expecting.

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.190
So I hope that you have some better understanding off.

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:27.790
Adios.

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:33.390
The next thing that we're going to do is to take a look at a working example and thereby

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:35.530
you'll have complete picture on what is ha dios,

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:36.450
How to use it,

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:37.150
etcetera
