00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.330
I was mentioning before that we can have restrictions on the silver side as to what kind of

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:09.130
media type that it is capable of handling at the moment.

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:13.750
Or get mattress capable of responding back with either Jason or example.

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:21.140
But let's say for some reason I want to restrict it toe respond back with only XML data or

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.140
,

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.950
said Jason,

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.090
how do I apply that restriction on this method?

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:26.690
Well,

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:34.550
it's by using the property producers and your specify list off media types,

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.050
but this method is capable of producing.

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:43.550
The reason why you're seeing the Serra is because when you have more than two attributes,

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.690
then you have to provide value for all that attributes that are present in the sanitation.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.250
So this is going to be value.

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:58.250
So now this method is capable of producing a drove this media types.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:59.920
So this matter,

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:05.150
essential is going to exhibit pretty much the same behavior as with our previous examples.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:12.920
So let's try to apply restrictions and say that this method is capable of generating only

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.650
Jason media type that saved the file and run it.

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:31.850
Let's go to Postman and if you send the request is going to work because Jason is supported

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:40.300
this chain the except Header to XML and see what's going to happen.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:46.650
You're probably going to see another and it says could not find acceptable representation

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.410
with four of success Reppas Staters.

00:01:49.410 --> 00:02:00.210
So that explains you can also have this attribute added at class level so that it will be

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.280
applicable in all the methods reciting in this class.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:15.250
One of the cases where this might come in handy is when you want to call a specific method

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.350
depending on the type of media type that it can handle.

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.090
So let me desperately copy this.

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.720
Obviously,

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:31.630
signature has to change something else and let me change this to XML,

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:32.650
for instance.

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:38.750
So now we have couple off methods.

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.270
If the client is requesting for Jason Data,

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:49.240
this method would be triggered or if the client is expecting XML data then replaced would

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.150
end up in here.

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.780
That's really want our application.

00:02:52.780 --> 00:03:00.850
And this time we shouldn't have any problem responding backward Maximal data.

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.820
In this case,

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:05.550
however,

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.150
the behavior off board this method is exactly the same,

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.850
and this may not imply a real time scenario.

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.520
So for this part was in order to demonstrate.

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:20.650
I'm going to introduce him Method that's going to respond back with a pity of media type.

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:29.150
I already have the cord copied just to save your time.

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.590
And here it iss.

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.250
In addition to this,

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:44.050
I've also created a pdf file and have put it inside the resources folder under files.

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.000
You can put any content inside the speedy if it doesn't matter.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:57.810
But what we're trying to do is when we try to send a get request requesting for a pdf media

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:58.250
type,

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:04.750
then this method will be triggered and ultimately isn't streams were trying to respond back

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.750
,

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.250
but pity of data.

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:07.720
Now,

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.050
I really hope that you don't expect me to walk you through all this cord.

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:12.850
This is all core Java.

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.250
All we're trying to do is using streams.

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:18.800
We're trying to read that file and make it part of the response.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:25.530
Isn't this response into the class you'll see more examples off response entity in coming

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:26.150
times.

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:30.050
So here is a PDF file We're trying to pick from the class part,

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:36.520
and then I'm trying to add a header which is basically the size or the content length off

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:43.310
the pdf file will be able to see this header as part of the response Headers and I'm using

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:50.100
this response and did the object to sort of create the response with headers as well as the

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:56.250
status code that's real on your application.

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:05.600
And this time XML would obviously fail.

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:09.550
Let me change the headers,

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:14.950
the acts of terror to Pdf and send the request again.

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:17.350
Well,

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:22.560
if you notice you don't see anything in here because Postman client is not capable of

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.150
displaying the period of content.

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:28.700
But you can say that it has worked because off the status scored toe wondered.

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:29.350
OK,

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:31.130
Along with that,

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:32.340
you'll also see the header,

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.150
which is a constant length off the PdF,

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:39.650
so that explains.
