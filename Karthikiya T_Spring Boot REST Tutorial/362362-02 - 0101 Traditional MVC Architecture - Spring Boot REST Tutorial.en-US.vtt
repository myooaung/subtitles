00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.050
before we dive went understanding Web services.

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:08.360
It might be a good idea to understand traditional monolithic embassy applications.

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.250
If you all don't know about them,

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:11.000
that's great.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.120
Otherwise,

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.940
it is a simple scenario.

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.860
Imagine that I have a company and we provide weather forecasting services.

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:19.520
Now,

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.010
whenever somebody visits our website off many features,

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.170
they're going to see a button that say's show current temperature.

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:29.430
When the user clicks on this button,

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:32.330
there be shown with the current temperature,

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:36.720
depending on these this location well behind the scenes.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.260
This is how it works.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.660
As soon as there's a flex a button.

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:41.750
Yesterday,

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.050
Perricos would be sent from the Broza to the server,

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:46.990
the underlying containable.

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:53.590
Then forward that request to irrelevant controller controllable delegate that call to model

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.590
.

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:58.810
This is where we would have the business logic interacting with the database etcetera.

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:00.370
And in our case,

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:05.650
we're going to figure out the current temperature in model section and then after that,

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:07.210
from within the model,

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.000
we're going to send back the response,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.600
basically an object that would constitute the data back to the controller controllable,

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.010
then handled that data to some view technology,

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.160
depending on the view technologies that you use.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.090
For example,

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:23.550
if you're using JSP,

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:29.320
the JSP would consume that data and just be file would become what it into equal.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.240
And so that file,

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.250
which will have bunch of printed in statements and then ultimately that so that would be

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.010
executed.

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:42.620
And the response would be sent back with the HTML back to the client.

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.410
And so user will see the response.

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:46.840
And in this case,

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.250
we're assuming that our application is reciting in a single silver.
