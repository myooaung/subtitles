00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.320
The next thing that we're going to do is to have the ability to fetch a specific record or

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.450
specific product information.

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:09.570
So first,

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.550
let me introduce the intra first mattered for our product service.

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:18.930
The method is going to take long ideas.

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:19.780
A perimeter.

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:25.230
This would correspond to the product I d and is going to respond back with that specific

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.050
product if it is available.

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:33.200
Let's go to the service implementation and provide the behavior.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.450
And here we have it.

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:40.750
What we have here is we're trying to search a specific product in the list off product.

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:41.290
Now,

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:42.690
this is all core Java.

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.670
I don't think I have to walk you through this code,

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:51.710
but here we have a never because we're trying to access a list that is not scoped within

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:52.350
the class.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:01:01.050
So let's move this list out off the matter and put it over here at class level.

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.400
However,

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:09.330
we still have a problem because the list one repopulated unless we first request all the

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.210
list of product.

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.650
So let's make this court a spot off the constructor.

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:31.180
We want to create a constructor real quick and let's populate the list.

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:38.120
Control shipped.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.750
Oh,

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.150
control shipped F.

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.530
And there you have it.

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.330
And inside the controller,

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.150
we already have this always dependence injected.

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.270
I'm just going to introduce another mattered.

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.070
But this time we have something called a path variable.

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.980
Because from the client we should be able to send the identifier.

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:06.080
Let me get this real quick and that's it.

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.000
So if you want to fetch a specific product detail,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.660
then in addition toe having this particular,

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.050
your mapping should also provide Dad into fire.

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.890
Let's relaunch your application and see how it works,

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:29.270
so I have the exact same request.

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.600
But this time I went up and the identify ire.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.740
Let's say I want to fetch details off iPhone,

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.150
so I would say one,

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:46.350
and it has retrieved the information of that specific product.
