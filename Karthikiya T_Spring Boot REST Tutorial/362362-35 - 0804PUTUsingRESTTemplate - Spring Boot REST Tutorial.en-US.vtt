00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.700
Let's take a look at how we can send the put request,

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.340
use and rest template in order to update and existing resource.

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:06.810
You know,

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.050
case we're going to update an existing product.

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:13.750
So our rep Luis one will expose the crowd.

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:19.400
Baby I and from Web service to will be sending the put request using rest template to Web

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.910
servers Want,

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:25.050
in order to update a resource Post will try to understand the put Matt that in Webster was

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.160
one maybe with a quick demo.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:32.430
And then we'll see how we can write cord to send a put request from Web service to use and

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.200
rest template.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.790
So it is the controller off pep service one.

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:39.230
And here is the put mattered.

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.030
This is going to accept the product object,

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.370
which is an Marshall washing off the Jason data that will be sending from the client

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.410
internally.

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:55.210
We're just trying to update the regard are the resource and then responding back with the

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:56.050
same object.

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.100
Let's see the functionality off it.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.050
So he wrote the list of products available.

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:12.950
I'm going to send a put request with this Jason Data.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:19.350
Let me change the name to maybe I for next and also increase the price to maybe whatever.

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.480
Let me copy the request as well.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:29.540
And let's send it okay,

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.160
We have to specify the content.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.330
Die,

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:32.150
Petters.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:44.750
Since we're sending the Jason data and it worked,

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.290
let's go to a web service to and take a look at the put matter.

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.890
What they're here is a method which I had introduced its contacts of the same barrel meter

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:54.890
,

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.550
the product object.

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:02.980
And here is the cost you are where would be sending the request to.

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:07.250
And this time since we have body off the Dick West,

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:13.690
we have created this Hajdib entity populating the body with the product object.

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:20.620
And then finally I'm using the exchange method and specified all the battle meters to send

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.990
a put request and get back with some response the resource,

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:31.220
your lee and then the method that I want to use to send the request that request itself,

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.790
which may have body and headers.

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:34.360
In our case,

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.750
we just need the body.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:42.010
The written type is expected out off the response.

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:43.640
And finally,

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:50.280
we're just responding back with the same object wrapped inside the response entity that's

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.890
run this application in a different boat off course.

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.290
Ford 80 81.

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:04.550
And from here,

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:10.150
I'm actually going to send the put request.

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.050
Let me try to update.

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.900
You know,

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.360
the available products.

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:25.760
Maybe I'd like to change this,

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.160
to wash into or whatever.

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.050
It doesn't matter.

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:33.450
And it got updated.

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:42.070
Hope it makes sense.
