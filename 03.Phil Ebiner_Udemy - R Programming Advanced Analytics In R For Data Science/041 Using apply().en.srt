00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:05,780
Hello.

2
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:11,550
Welcome back to that course in our programming in this tutorial we're going to finally start learning

3
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:13,450
how to use the Apply function in art.

4
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,290
So let's jump straight into it.

5
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:18,840
The first question I want to ask is What is the Apply function.

6
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,340
So let's bring up the Help for this function.

7
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:27,780
And if I open this one here and we zoom in a bit you can see that the function has a falling structure

8
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:27,810
.

9
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:31,170
So the word apply X margin and fun fun.

10
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:38,460
The third argument is the function that you want to apply to your matrix X and margin is specifying

11
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:42,690
where they want to apply to the columns or you want to apply it to the rows.

12
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,800
Or you can even apply to the rows and columns.

13
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:49,050
So here you can see that for a matrix one indicates the rows.

14
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:55,380
So if you want to apply a certain function like that say the average find the average of CRN rows of

15
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:59,400
all the rows then you'll say 1 in place of margin.

16
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:03,030
You want the average for columns you'll say two in place of margin.

17
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:08,820
And also you've got these optional arguments which if fun requires optional arguments you can pass them

18
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:12,590
on after as additional arguments for the play function.

19
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:21,060
And here you can see that also a side note that in cases of functions like plus and matrix multiplication

20
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:26,480
subtraction division all those functions that don't have a name are actually have a symbol instead.

21
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:29,300
Then they must be backordered or quoted.

22
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:35,030
But we will be delving into those kind of operations in our tutorial so we won't stop on that.

23
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,560
That's more of a side note for us.

24
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:37,990
OK.

25
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,130
So there is our apply function how do we use it.

26
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,670
Let's get some hands on practice.

27
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:50,080
So we're you're going to say apply and then we're going to apply this to our Chicago matrix.

28
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,190
So what do we want to do.

29
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:57,570
We want to apply and want to look at the average for our Chicago matrix so let's just run Chicago first

30
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:58,550
here.

31
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,580
Here you can see that it's got five rows and 12 columns.

32
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:05,180
We want the average for every row.

33
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:06,220
How do we do that.

34
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:09,300
Well we specify the matrix here.

35
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,890
Then we want to specify that we want to apply something to all the rows.

36
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:14,820
That means one.

37
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:21,000
One stands for rows and then we want to tell the Apply function what exactly it is that we apply and

38
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,780
we're applying the average function which is called Mean.

39
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:29,940
Now we don't need any brackets after mean in the specific case when you're just passing the name of

40
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:30,820
the function.

41
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,020
So if you run that there you go as simple as that.

42
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:38,130
So you got five rows that's where you are five results for every single roll you've got the average

43
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:38,150
.

44
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:43,830
So we've got the average of those temperatures the average high temperatures in Fahrenheit is fifty

45
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,110
nine point three.

46
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:52,360
The average of the average low Fahrenheit temperatures which I hear is 43 five and so on.

47
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:53,120
All right.

48
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:54,420
So that makes sense.

49
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:57,480
And you can always just quickly spot check this.

50
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:58,530
Let's check it.

51
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:04,050
You can say mean and then you just choose one of these rows and run it for that.

52
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:11,760
So let's say Chicago here we're going to say let's look at the Rose which is called days with precipitation

53
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:14,130
and coma nothing.

54
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:21,150
So if I run this line you'll see that the average for this row if you calculate separately is nine point

55
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,080
nine 1:06.

56
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:25,600
And here it was also calculated as 9.9 1 6.

57
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:27,920
So everything seems to be running smooth.

58
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,980
Awesome.

59
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:34,770
Now let's analyze one city in a bit more detail what other functions can reply.

60
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:39,660
That's where the word apply comes from because we're literally saying what other functions can we apply

61
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:41,060
to this matrix.

62
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,820
So there it is Chicago right.

63
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,330
What other functions can't blind.

64
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:46,260
Well obviously we can look at the max right.

65
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,440
So does that apply.

66
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,230
Chicago won max.

67
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:58,640
So that's the maximum values and you can see here that is indeed 84 is the maximum 68 was the maximum

68
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:04,270
in this call and this row four point thirteen was the maximum in this row and so on.

69
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:10,250
And then we went to apply same thing Chicago by want to apply the minimum.

70
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:14,350
So this will tell us what the minimum Nitro was great.

71
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:19,860
Now we're going to do the following thing just for practice because it doesn't really make sense in

72
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:24,390
our specific case but we're going to look for the maximum in every column.

73
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:24,740
Right.

74
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:31,110
It doesn't make sense here because this type of matrix is more kind of actually is more of a doorframe

75
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:38,180
and kind of flipped out a frame where every column or every row here is kind of a separate metric that

76
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:44,920
really can't so it's either this foreign high temperature or in precipitation in inches or days of precipitation

77
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:49,760
it should really be comparing them across each other doesn't make any sense whatsoever.

78
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:51,710
But for practice purposes we're going to do that.

79
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:56,480
We're going to just see what the maximum or minimum in each of the columns is.

80
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:58,180
So let's go ahead and do it.

81
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,030
How would we do that.

82
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:00,750
Well I would just say apply.

83
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:07,330
And also Chicago then will say to which is for columns two stands for columns and I'll say Max Right

84
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:07,430
.

85
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:08,250
So there we go.

86
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:15,070
Of course it has picked up this whole row as Max because it's over 100 and the rest are under 100.

87
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,580
And then you can do the same thing.

88
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:17,780
And just a minute.

89
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,000
So I'm just going to say it doesn't make much sense.

90
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:25,470
But good exercise.

91
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,670
So just remember that this was an exercise.

92
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:29,260
All right.

93
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:35,390
And now are we going to do is we're going to get a little bit closer to what we are.

94
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:40,350
We've been asked to deliver it right so we're going to compare some cities side by size.

95
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:43,160
So let's take this line that we have here.

96
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:47,460
Chicago with the average cop here a few times.

97
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:50,690
So here we're going to change this to New York.

98
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:57,000
And here we are going to say Houston and here in San Francisco.

99
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:57,480
All right.

100
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:04,060
So now if I were on these lines let's just run them all one by one.

101
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,300
One two three four.

102
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:11,850
You'll notice that we've come up with something very similar to what we are officer.

103
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:19,240
So we are officer a representation of annual averages of every metric for every city.

104
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,530
So we want to find.

105
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:25,980
So like let's have a look at Chicago so we need the average for this row.

106
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,970
The average for this show average for every single road.

107
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,240
So that would be for Chicago.

108
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,960
And when you compare them across the different cities and that's exactly what we have here.

109
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:37,560
So here in Chicago we get average for every single row.

110
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:41,350
New York we've got the average Houston average San Francisco average.

111
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,940
So already here visually.

112
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:49,530
Right now we can compare and we can say OK the average high Fahrenheit temperature was the highest in

113
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:50,550
Houston.

114
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:50,960
Right.

115
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,800
Annual average average of average is actually then low.

116
00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:02,470
So the average of this column annually was the highest Where was it in.

117
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:06,110
Also in Houston and the lowest was in Chicago.

118
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:10,150
And then the precipitation the highest was in Houston as well.

119
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:12,150
Days with precipitation.

120
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,200
Interesting result.

121
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,170
It was actually higher in New York.

122
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:22,920
So more rainy days and hours of sunshine here you can compare and you can see that in San Francisco

123
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:24,960
is the most sunshine.

124
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,120
Now this isn't of course the final result.

125
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,280
We're very close.

126
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:31,060
We can already compare these.

127
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:36,810
Right now we could have used something like see bind to bind these into matrix to get our final result

128
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:36,840
.

129
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:42,210
However we will instead progress through the section of the course and you'll see that there are more

130
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:48,740
methods that are available to you in your arsenal and that can get you to that final result that we're

131
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,510
looking for much quicker.

132
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:58,500
So here I'm just going to say let's make a comment here step away a bit and we'll say so this is deliverable

133
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:02,860
one but there is a faster way.

134
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:03,410
Right.

135
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:07,680
So actually say nearly says not the final deliverable.

136
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:12,480
It's very close and further down in the course in the section of the course we will find that there

137
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,460
are other ways to get to what we are after.

138
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,020
All right.

139
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:22,920
So hopefully this illustrates how powerful the Apply function is and we'll actually talk more about

140
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:26,800
that in the upcoming tutorials and I'll see you next time.

141
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:30,300
Until then happy coding.
