00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:08,340
Hello welcome back to the advanced course in our programming.

2
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:12,030
Now that we know how to single out rows with missing values.

3
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:18,570
Today we are slowly going to start working on our data set to either correct these values remove them

4
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:20,390
or make other decisions about them.

5
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:25,030
And specifically today we're going to be removing records with missing data.

6
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:31,700
So let's first go back to our Excel spreadsheet and see which records we agreed that we need to remove

7
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:31,940
.

8
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:37,710
So the ones that we want to remove are the ones in the industry column because let's say hypothetically

9
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:44,670
and as you'll actually see further down in the section we do need the industry column for our analysis

10
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,880
so we can just keep them empty or.

11
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:53,190
And in this case we can research the values for these companies because they're actually imaginary companies

12
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:55,500
so these two options don't work for us.

13
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:01,890
The only option that all is just keep those Let's just say that we're doing this option we're removing

14
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:02,970
the lines.

15
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,450
And that's what we're going to be working on today we're going to be removing these lines.

16
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,260
And just a quick note for Inception.

17
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:15,390
We don't we're not going to be relying heavily on this information in our analysis so we're just going

18
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:17,850
to keep the value empty here.

19
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:24,530
So let's go ahead and work on this industry on these rows of empty values in the industry column.

20
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:25,830
Back to our.

21
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:31,530
And first things first whenever you're working with Datto whenever you clean up a data set.

22
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:38,690
My biggest recommendation to you is always make a backup because we've done quite a lot of work so far

23
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,700
and as you could see here and sometimes we had to rerun all of these lines.

24
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:49,530
So let's just make a backup of our current data set as it is so that you know if anything goes wrong

25
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:51,720
we can always restore it from this point.

26
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:56,510
So we're just going to say fin back up and then we're going to say fine.

27
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:57,860
Simple as that.

28
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:01,520
And that one line can save us a lot of trouble.

29
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:02,080
There we go.

30
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:09,120
Now we've got our back up ready in here and now we're going to look at these rows that we are interested

31
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:09,390
in.

32
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:13,070
So how do we find these rows.

33
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:18,570
First of all let's look at all of the rows that have some empty values so we're really not to do that

34
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:21,120
complete cases comma nothing.

35
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:27,690
And here is going to be fin around that you can see that we've got all of the rows that have an empty

36
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:29,990
value somewhere in one of the columns.

37
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:35,190
And so we only have two rows in the industry column that have empty values and we're going to need to

38
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:35,790
work with them.

39
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:42,930
Of course we could just look at these rows based on their IDs so we know that the ID number here or

40
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:47,820
we can look at the wrong number and or the name of the company we could work with like that.

41
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:53,820
But there is a better approach because we do know this is a function we can single out these rows by

42
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:54,660
themselves.

43
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:55,740
So let's go ahead and do that.

44
00:02:55,740 --> 00:03:01,830
So we'll say fin is dot NA and we want to check the industry column.

45
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:02,300
Right.

46
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,690
So comma nothing.

47
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:08,680
So we want to see which rows have something empty in the industry column.

48
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:09,150
There we go.

49
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:15,190
So there are our two rows number 14 and 15 or IDs 14 and 15.

50
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:19,980
And now what are we going to do is we're going to simply take the same line and we're going to take

51
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:20,810
the opposite.

52
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:21,220
Right.

53
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:26,450
So we're going to say which rows are not empty in that specific column.

54
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:34,290
So are we taking the opposite way around that you can see that if we scroll up up up up up and we look

55
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:41,510
for our rows we'll see 10 11 12 13 and then 16 17 18 19.

56
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:42,000
There we go.

57
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,080
So those two Thoreau's have been removed in this representation.

58
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:50,090
And now all we have to do is go and sign it back into fin.

59
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:56,100
So that's how you remove Roe So you first create the subset and then you override the previous doorframe

60
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,310
with that subset.

61
00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:04,270
And now if I look at fin you'll see that if you scroll up to the top so scrolling scrolling scrolling

62
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:04,730
.

63
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:10,700
And here we see that 12 13 14 15 or so 14 15 are missing.

64
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:14,980
And that's exactly what we wanted we have subsided our doorframe.

65
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:15,690
So there you go.

66
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:18,080
It's as simple as that to remove the rows.

67
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:22,610
And we do have that back up in case we made a mistake somewhere.

68
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:29,520
And now if we just look at our complete cases or look for our names you can see that we have dealt with

69
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,660
two rows already.

70
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,090
They're not in this industry.

71
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:36,610
Call me Concini and A's and slowly we are going to get through all of them.

72
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:40,440
OK Popinjay's Tauriel and I look forward to seeing you on the next one.

73
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:44,240
Until then happy coding.
