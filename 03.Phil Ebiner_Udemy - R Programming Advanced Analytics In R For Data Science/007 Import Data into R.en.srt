00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:11,670
Hello and welcome back to the advanced course on our in this tutorial we're going to import the data

2
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:12,800
set into our studio.

3
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:18,420
So as you can see we've got our studio open in front of me and I encourage you to follow along so that

4
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:21,900
you can have the same code on your screen as well.

5
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:22,200
All right.

6
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,280
So let's get started.

7
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:28,950
First things first we're going to get the working directory for our our studio as we can see the working

8
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:31,870
directory here is users curial Eremenko.

9
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:35,370
So that's not where I have stored the file.

10
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:41,970
I stored the file in a folder on my desktop so I'm going to set the working directory to that so that

11
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:45,080
I can all work in that folder right away.

12
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,470
I'll show you how to do it both on Mac and Windows so we'll start with Mac.

13
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:50,410
I meant to say set working directory.

14
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:55,890
And here in quotation marks I'm going to say users are so similar to what we see here.

15
00:00:55,950 --> 00:01:05,130
Actually this copy that users curagh slash curial Eremenko then desktop then our programming and bonds

16
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:05,580
.

17
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:08,610
All right so that's how you set the word inertia on a Mac.

18
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:09,560
Let's run the slide.

19
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:14,470
As you can see the working directory has been run and let's just check it out.

20
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:16,260
It has been set to the correct folder.

21
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:16,810
That's good.

22
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:18,830
So this is for Mac users.

23
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:24,710
And if you're watching and doing these tutorials on Windows then the procedure is a bit different.

24
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:26,810
You need to type in set working directory.

25
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:32,640
And here the path should be specified instead of using forward slashes.

26
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,970
You need double backslashes.

27
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:42,010
So for instance A B C double backslash users double backslash curial double backslash desktop double

28
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:45,270
backslash our programming advanced.

29
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:52,200
So depending on where your file folder is stored so in this case it's on the C drive in the user's folder

30
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:56,960
in the folder of my name then desktop and then our programming and once.

31
00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:00,990
So I'm just going to come in this hour so it's not in the way but if you're using Windows then that

32
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:03,480
is a format on Mac that is the format.

33
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:08,220
All right so then just make sure to run good working directly to confirm that the word integrity has

34
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:09,080
been changed.

35
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:15,150
And now we're going to import our data set so as you can see we have nothing in our global environment

36
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:15,540
here.

37
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:21,910
And let's go ahead and use the read dot CSV function which we are well familiar with.

38
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:29,190
Now now we're going to type in the name of our data set which is future $500 CACP in quotation marks

39
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:34,340
and we're going to assign what Reid says period turns to an object right.

40
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:40,200
So we're going to store our data set in this doorframe which is called fin stands for financial because

41
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:45,140
we're dealing with financial data is going to use the name of the data set as been.

42
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:50,700
So we're on this line as you can see we've got an object we've got a data frame of 500 observations

43
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,320
11 variables.

44
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:57,390
So it's got some information there but we don't need that because we have other ways of exploring this

45
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:57,900
data set.

46
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:58,990
Now in our.

47
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,700
So let's proceed to that.

48
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:08,190
The first way we know is to just run the name of this data set and that'll bring it all out here as

49
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:12,970
I guess it is a lot of lines way too many for us to look at in this way.

50
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:17,780
So we're going to use some tricks that we know when dealing with data sets.

51
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:21,990
We're going to look at the top a certain number of rows so we just look at ahead thin.

52
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,300
And let me expand this.

53
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:28,620
We won't be needing this window much in this section of the course so we're just going to keep it close

54
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,470
like that.

55
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:36,390
So if I run ahead fin there you can see we've got the top six rows of our data set and it's got all

56
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:39,870
the Call them so it kind of gives you a good understanding of what's going on.

57
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:46,640
Also we can look at the tail of fin then we get the bottom row so we can see indeed this 500.

58
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:49,890
And there hasn't been any road shifts or column shifts.

59
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:51,220
Everything looks okay.

60
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:52,190
It's always good to check.

61
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:57,270
And if you want to check a few more rows and 6 and just say here just pass a parameter let's say 10

62
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,980
then I'll give you Moroz.

63
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:01,980
Same with hedgie you can check more rows that way.

64
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:05,420
And now let's have a look at the structure of our data set.

65
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:07,830
So as you are fin there we go.

66
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:14,620
We've got a quick description of every column what it is that's an integer that's a factor that's factors

67
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:17,030
and integer factors integer factor.

68
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:20,590
And finally let's look at summary fin.

69
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,570
So there we go.

70
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:25,560
We've got some stats on every single one of these Kolbe's.

71
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:33,540
So all of this should be already familiar to you from our basic course on our programming and today

72
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:37,260
what we wanted to focus on is that we've got a lot of factors here.

73
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:41,460
So we've got a lot of factors that we're dealing with and factors are going to be quite important for

74
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:44,580
us in this section of the course on a door operation.

75
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:50,730
So in the upcoming tutorial we're going to have a quick refresher on factors because we really do need

76
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:54,580
one just so that we're all on the same page when we're dealing with factors.

77
00:04:54,840 --> 00:05:00,270
But other than that the data set has been imported into our end if you would like to start playing around

78
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:03,970
with it you can do so and I look forward to seeing the next tutorial.

79
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:07,680
Until then happy coding.
