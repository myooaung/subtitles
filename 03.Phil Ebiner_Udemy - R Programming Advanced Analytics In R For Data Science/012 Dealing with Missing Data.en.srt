00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:10,680
Hello and welcome back to the course in our program today we're talking about dealing with missing data

2
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:20,780
so missing data is a very common theme in data science or analytics and it happens because data set

3
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:26,850
sometimes not full or there might have been some errors while it was being supplied or somebody forgot

4
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:32,340
to put something in or just basically that data was not collected in the first place.

5
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:34,980
So dealing with missing data is important.

6
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:42,030
You need to know what options you have and what approaches you can take in order to fix the data or

7
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:44,580
maybe not fix the data and what you do.

8
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:47,020
Every different case today will quickly overview.

9
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:51,450
What exactly are those options that you have.

10
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:51,720
All right.

11
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:59,730
So option 1 is the best option when you can predict the missing data with 100 percent accuracy and we'll

12
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:03,630
see examples of this in our tutorials in this section.

13
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:10,290
For instance if the field for a state is missing but you know that the cities New York will in that

14
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:15,150
case you know for sure that the state is actually also New York.

15
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:15,390
Right.

16
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:20,730
Or if the city is San Francisco and the state is missing then the state is actually California.

17
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:27,840
So things like that or for instance another good example is where you have two variables and you can

18
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,550
derive the third variable based on that.

19
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:35,370
So for instance if you know revenue and expenses but the field for profit is missing well in that case

20
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:41,610
it's very easy to derive profit because profit is actually a sequel to revenue minus expenses assuming

21
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:47,310
that there's no issues in the data that was supply originally and that there were no errors or there

22
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:52,020
was no fraud then that is a calculation that you would perform.

23
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:57,360
So that is the best case scenario when you can't predict the data 100 percent accuracy and then it's

24
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:03,930
as if you never had any missing data then the next option is to leave the record as is.

25
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:08,420
So don't change anything about it just leave that cell empty.

26
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:11,830
And when we use this well this approach would work.

27
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:18,990
If for instance that specific field is not important for our analysis and we'll see an example of this

28
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:23,640
if the field is not important for analysis then doesn't really matter that it's empty.

29
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:28,710
The other option is that if the algorithm that you're going to be applying your data set and this is

30
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:34,380
a bit more advanced if the algorithm you're going to be applying it actually already incorporates some

31
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:40,010
methodology is to account for missing data and to correct that inside the algorithm.

32
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:48,000
And in that case also leaving the record is OK because the competition on method will take care of it

33
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,110
.

34
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:54,270
Next is remove the record entirely so sometimes you're missing some critical data.

35
00:02:54,510 --> 00:03:01,680
And in that case when you cannot restore the data the only option that you might have left is to completely

36
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:07,820
remove that whole row from your analysis in order to keep your analysis.

37
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:12,390
So nerd's keep your algorithms working or keep your approach working.

38
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,110
You have to remove this one record.

39
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:16,260
And this has a drawback.

40
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:23,580
The drawback here is that your analysis becomes less significant or has a smaller sample and that can

41
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,230
have certain implications.

42
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:30,600
So if you're fine of sacrificing a few rows here and there and it's not critical for you to have information

43
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:35,630
and every single record then this could be another approach that you might apply.

44
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,520
Next one is a replace with the mean or median.

45
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:45,810
This is a very popular approach and we're going to also see an example of this in our data set in our

46
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:49,450
tutorials this is going to be one of the main approaches we're going to be relying on.

47
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:56,280
And so basically here you can say that if for instance you have lots and lots of browes and they all

48
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:03,030
have a certain value for revenue and that one row is missing that value then you can calculate the mean

49
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:08,910
or the median and put it in there and then proceed with your analysis.

50
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:15,930
So I mean is an ok option but usually median is preferred because median is less affected by outliers

51
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:16,250
.

52
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:16,970
All right.

53
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:19,410
So that's another approach.

54
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:25,170
And then we've got to fill in by exploring correlations and similarities so that's kind of a step up

55
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:32,550
from mean or median where you can actually create regressions or you can create different models that

56
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:38,660
will find your data set predict what the values for those empty cells could have been.

57
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:43,240
So that is an extra step up from mean or median.

58
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,920
And finally introduce a dummy variable for missing this.

59
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:51,360
This is a very interesting approach where we actually introduce new new bearable and where some data

60
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:51,890
is missing.

61
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:58,440
You give it a yes flag when it's not missing you know no flag and you can and you explore the correlations

62
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:01,320
of that variable with the outcome that you're looking for.

63
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:08,190
So this is also a more advanced approach and we won't be looking at it in these tutorials.

64
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:15,260
All right so now let's have a look at our actual data set and see what the data is missing in there

65
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:18,530
is going to be quite an interesting exploration.

66
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:24,750
So I'm going to move to the data set and zoom in a little bit here and here you can see the same exact

67
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,310
data as we see in our blood.

68
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:31,450
It's actually an Excel because here I could color it nicely and show you around.

69
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:34,040
All right so here's the data set.

70
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:38,400
And let's go from left top to bottom left to right.

71
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,150
So what do we have here.

72
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:40,880
We've got employees right.

73
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:46,980
So in this case what we can do this missing daughter so the red represents missing data.

74
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:51,870
What we can do here is we can replace or proxy it with the industry median.

75
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:56,730
So I'm going I'm going to do is I'm going to as we go through this I'm going to show comment.

76
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,740
So here we can't just proxy of the industry media we can take the median for this whole column and just

77
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:08,010
put it in there and because we have this classification by industry we can simply look at only the companies

78
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:13,260
that are in retail and that we will get an even better approximation than if we took the whole media

79
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:19,080
for the whole role and also median is better because if we took them mean then there are some outliers

80
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:24,960
here so companies that have 1500 employees and there's another company here as you can see there's also

81
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:30,120
a few more missing values as you scroll through the data said there is a company here with even more

82
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:30,830
employees.

83
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:38,580
But basically that's the point that some outliers with huge numbers of employees will skew the mean

84
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:38,610
.

85
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:39,520
But with the median.

86
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,210
They won't affect it that much.

87
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:42,040
OK.

88
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,100
So what else do we have.

89
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:47,950
Well let's proceed to industry then in this case what can we do here.

90
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:54,690
Here we can either keep it empty right or we can research the value or we can remove the line entirely

91
00:06:55,110 --> 00:07:01,920
and in our case industry is an important factor for or an important variable for our analysis.

92
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:07,050
So in our case we're going to assume that we current research the value so we're going to just remove

93
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:14,530
the records with the missing industry then Inception or the year when the company was formed here which

94
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:19,970
you can do is you can either keep it empty or research it or remove lines of industry and burn my hair

95
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:26,820
you countered proxied you can just take the average or the mean value for the inception for all the

96
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:32,400
other companies because that doesn't work that it's not it's supposed to be a numeric value it's actually

97
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:38,820
more of a it's more of a category so you can just take an average of the year of Inception put it in

98
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:39,260
here.

99
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:43,130
So you either research it or you just remove the line keep it empty.

100
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:48,420
In our case it's not going to be that much of an important variable so we're going to just keep this

101
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,180
line as it is.

102
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:55,850
All right State what can we do if said well this is that example that we talked about that here.

103
00:07:55,890 --> 00:08:01,680
This can be corrected with 100 percent certainty we can say that the state is New York here and this

104
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:08,610
is another example that here with 100 percent certainty we can calculate that the expenses is the revenue

105
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:14,460
minus profit so we know that profit is revenue mind's expenses if we solve that equation for expenses

106
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:19,080
we get expenses equals profits so we can easily calculated here.

107
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:23,340
And then we've got a line here where we've got the revenue expenses and profit.

108
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:24,740
All three are missing.

109
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,710
So what can we do here.

110
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,750
And actually Graaff is missing as well.

111
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:34,400
What can we do here we can proxy all of these with industry medians so we would proxy the revenue of

112
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:35,510
the industry median.

113
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:41,100
Expensive was with the industry median the profit would have to calculate because once we know our own

114
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:47,020
expenses profit is 100 percent certain and grow food also proxy with industry medium.

115
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:53,700
So this is how we deal with different missing elements in our data as you can see we're applying different

116
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:58,960
approaches in different situations some place we get proxy some places we can predict or find out to

117
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:04,000
100 percent certainly some places we just have to remove the rose and some places we can keep them.

118
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:09,750
So it all depends on your understanding of the data set and the methods that you're going to be applying

119
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:10,850
for analyzing it.

120
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:15,540
And then once you know all of that then you can make these judgment calls on what is going to be replaced

121
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,070
what is going to be kept.

122
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:22,920
All right so that's our overview of missing daughter and we're going to get started on all of this in

123
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,390
the next tutorial and I look forward See you then.

124
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:27,030
Until next time happy coding

125
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:32,700
