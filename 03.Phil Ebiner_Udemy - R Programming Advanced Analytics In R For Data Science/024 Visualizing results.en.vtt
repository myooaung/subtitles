00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:11.800
Hello and welcome back to that course on our program I've got the project brief in front of me here

2
00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.880
.

3
00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:17.100
And I wanted to point out that throughout this whole section in all these posts Tauriel is all we've

4
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.160
been doing is preparing the data set.

5
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.210
So we've been working on this bit that the data set has numerous discrepancies that need to be addressed

6
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.760
before the analysis can be.

7
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:31.630
And only now we are proceeding to the analysis and we're going to create these charts and scatterplot

8
00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:31.890
.

9
00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.800
So how mind blowing is that that daughter preparation takes up so much time.

10
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.640
Yes of course we've been learning and that has contribute to the fact that it has taken quite a while

11
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.460
to go through our preparation but that is the reality of life in the world of data science.

12
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.470
About 70 percent of the time goes into our preparation because you want your daughter to be very robust

13
00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.520
.

14
00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.450
You wanted to have non-normalized you want to make sure everything is correct before we proceed with

15
00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:02.200
the analysis and that also makes the analysis very smooth and effortless.

16
00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.690
And that is what we'll see today.

17
00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.970
So let's proceed to create these wonderful charts now.

18
00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:13.620
So I've got our studio here in front of me and I've even already copied the three charts that we need

19
00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:14.010
to create.

20
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.810
We're going to start with the scatterplot that is classified by industry showing revenue expense and

21
00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:19.620
profit.

22
00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:23.490
So first we're going to connect the Jiechi plots to library.

23
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:30.090
So if you don't have it installed then you'll probably need to run this line install packages and then

24
00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.750
in quotation marks are going to need to type in G-G plots too.

25
00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.440
So just run this line if you don't have deploy it installed.

26
00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:44.980
Otherwise you just need to connect the GGP to library and which you'll see here is in packages.

27
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.170
The G.G. plot 2 package of course in packages you'll see G-G plot two has been connected.

28
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.480
That's what we want.

29
00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.810
And then we want to start plotting right.

30
00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:04.470
So first things first we're going to create a plot so we can say P G-G plot and then Dadda it was thin

31
00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.550
.

32
00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.210
Right so we're going to set up our data set four of four working with later.

33
00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:16.050
By the way if you're not familiar with G-G plots to then all of this is covered in my our programming

34
00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:21.680
to Zed course and that's where we learn everything about G-G plot and how to use it.

35
00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.690
So definitely check that out if you're not yet familiar with what we're trying to do here.

36
00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.050
Now we're going to add a layer of geometry on our plot.

37
00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.890
So right now it's empty.

38
00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:33.850
There's nothing there.

39
00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.800
Well I haven't even printed it out.

40
00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.600
So if I just print it out you'll see that it's empty.

41
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:44.190
I'm going to add a layer of geometry which is going to be points because we want to scatterplot And

42
00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:45.820
of course we want this statics.

43
00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:50.620
So the x axis is going to be revenue because what are we plotting here.

44
00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.780
We're plottings have law to classify brains for sharing revenue expenses profit so revenue is going

45
00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:00.060
to be our x axis expense is going to be a Y-axis profit is going to be the size.

46
00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.690
So we'll start reframing and expenses come a y equals expenses.

47
00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:06.120
Right.

48
00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.450
So let's run that as you can see we've got that geometry lined up right.

49
00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:12.670
That's good.

50
00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.750
What do you want next is we want to add some color.

51
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.960
So color is going to be industry and this is all happening inside this function because these are aesthetics

52
00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:26.580
or these are this is a mapping of variables we're not setting them we're mapping them if we we're setting

53
00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.090
them we would be doing this outside of the brackets.

54
00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.460
So color equals industry so far on these lines.

55
00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:37.020
Now you'll see that we've got a bit of color but still there are bleak because they're very small so

56
00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:40.180
here we're going to do size equals profit.

57
00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:46.260
So if we run that much better right so because this is a draft charge we're not going to spend too much

58
00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.530
time on fixing up the labels and the axes and making it very very pretty.

59
00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:56.500
All we wanted from here is to see the results of our analysis so we can see that the biggest bubbles

60
00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.240
are over here where revenues high expenses are low which makes sense.

61
00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:06.780
And then you can see how these companies are falling into these indices So maybe let's make this a bit

62
00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:13.110
more space here so you can see exactly what's going on that which industry is I.T. services has no majority

63
00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:14.290
of companies here.

64
00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:20.190
And then you've got to kind of like a mix you've got some government services here of quite high expenses

65
00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:25.040
the brown ones seem to be here financial services so expense that quite low.

66
00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.620
And then you've got some pink ones over here so pink is software.

67
00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.130
We've got some red ones for construction retail purple ones are here.

68
00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:37.980
So basically any industry you pick from your legend here you can quickly assess where are they lying

69
00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:43.460
in this kind of Quadrant representation of all the companies that we have in the data set.

70
00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:48.990
So I'm sure they'll be happy with this chart as a draft and then you can work on it further to make

71
00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.800
it look pretty.

72
00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:55.410
Once you've delivered the first draft next what you're going to do is we're going to be using the same

73
00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:00.660
Plaut we get with the same data we're going to add some industry to some trends right so we're going

74
00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:07.620
to do pretty much same thing we're going to do point right æsthetics And here we're going to say X equals

75
00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:16.760
revenue so same chart y equals expenses and color equals industry just this time we're not going to

76
00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:22.130
include size for profit because we need we are going to focus on something else so let's run these lines

77
00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:22.940
for now.

78
00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:26.340
And now on top of that we're going to overlay some smoother.

79
00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:30.120
We're going to say plus DRM on their score smooth.

80
00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:32.420
And here we want aesthetics.

81
00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:37.970
So in high stakes we're going to use similar things as we did here so let's just maybe copy that along

82
00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:38.410
.

83
00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:39.790
There we go.

84
00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.980
In fact you probably would have been easier if we did this.

85
00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:44.090
Let's do this.

86
00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:51.950
So it looks more elegant will say it's going to be D plus D and it will say data.

87
00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:54.590
And then you just add these æsthetics right in there.

88
00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:59.900
So we don't have to copy them twice and then we can get rid of this leave some space.

89
00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:03.380
All right so if I run and then we can just rename this to D.

90
00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:08.550
So if I run this that's out the chart and here you should see some Smithers.

91
00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:09.520
Don't look great.

92
00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:15.250
And that's because we want to put Phil equals an A and size equals 1.2.

93
00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.000
So make them a bit wider.

94
00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:18.850
Run that again much better.

95
00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:20.790
So I'll just explain what I did here.

96
00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:27.540
I created a new plot which I called the same data set but it's already got preset æsthetics.

97
00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:31.000
What's going we talked about all this in the basic course and our.

98
00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:37.490
So I've set the X to be revenue always whenever I use the YTB expenses whenever I use the collar to

99
00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:39.480
be industry whenever I use D.

100
00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:46.690
Then on top of that I overlaid a layer of points which we see here and then I overlaid some Smulders

101
00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:46.960
.

102
00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:53.150
So those are these lines that show us these trends and I've put the field to and so we don't see the

103
00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:55.610
certainty bands or confidence bands.

104
00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:59.230
And then I've just increased the size of the smooth to one point two.

105
00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:04.280
And here you can see some interesting trends So for instance here you can see construction it's going

106
00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:09.680
like it's got this big dip so as construction companies are actually quite a few companies construction

107
00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:11.790
and government services.

108
00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:15.490
And bear in mind these are all made up data sets so this is purely a coincidence.

109
00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:16.380
What we're seeing here.

110
00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:22.280
But as construction companies and government services companies kind of start nearing the 10 million

111
00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:28.460
dollar mark in revenue their expenses start increasing which eats into their expenses actually start

112
00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:29.360
decreasing.

113
00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:30.340
Interesting enough.

114
00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:35.900
So obviously this is the best part to be where your revenues growing expenses are decreasing.

115
00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:41.570
But then as revenue keeps growing further for some companies expenses start increasing for other companies

116
00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:43.940
on the other hand expenses start decreasing.

117
00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:50.270
And here you see quite a consistent trend for the financial services companies so that consistency speaks

118
00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:54.010
to probably that they know what they're doing generally.

119
00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:57.570
So they're all kind of on the same trajectory.

120
00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:01.680
And the last chart that we need is the box plots.

121
00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:03.280
So let's have a look at that.

122
00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:12.410
We're going to create a new one will say for instance and f is going to be G-G plot and the CDATA equals

123
00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:13.290
fin.

124
00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:19.220
We'll just I will add the aesthetics as well we'll say æsthetics so for a box plot we need X to be industry

125
00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:19.260
.

126
00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:25.100
So that's a categorical x y to be growth because that's what we're going to be focusing on.

127
00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:28.910
And then we want color to also be industry.

128
00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:32.970
So let's maybe get a new line here color equals industry.

129
00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:35.020
All right so Jeff is ready.

130
00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:39.800
And now we're going to overlay a box plot Jorm underscore box bouillotte.

131
00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:42.780
So just bracket's run that.

132
00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:45.170
There we go some blackspot sizes and good.

133
00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:48.990
So let's maybe increase the size equals one a bit bigger.

134
00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:54.390
So here we can see the construction industry is sitting at around 10 percent in growth as we saw.

135
00:08:54.560 --> 00:09:00.470
And then we've got some other companies some industries like I.T. services is up there at the highest

136
00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:02.670
and health is the low.

137
00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:08.760
No it's government services that's the lowest and probably as a little extra bonus.

138
00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:12.920
What I'd like to do box Blotz is I'd like to go.

139
00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:16.850
Plus rather than the box blow right away so we can copy this.

140
00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:25.280
But before the blocks but what I usually do is I add Geonim jitter and for the jitter we just keep everything

141
00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:26.120
as is.

142
00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:31.070
So if I run that you'll see like the points appear at the bottom and then we just need to correct the

143
00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:31.940
box for a little bit.

144
00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:33.200
So we'll say Alpha.

145
00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:40.460
It calls 0.5 I'm adding transparency to the locks Plaut and then these outliers because outliers get

146
00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:44.230
duplicated because of the jitter we need to get rid of the outliers.

147
00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:47.350
So outlier caller calls an A.

148
00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:52.050
Once again everything all of this is covered in the basic course on our programming so if you've done

149
00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:54.940
that of course you are already familiar with what we're doing.

150
00:09:55.010 --> 00:10:01.040
We've just created this beautiful baulks plots that represent the different industries that we've been

151
00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:07.460
analyzing and every single point is a company in our data set so we can see where they all fall.

152
00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:11.000
So there we go we've got the three amazing charts we've got.

153
00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:17.460
These are some box plots that those were our trends and we've also got our scatterplot.

154
00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:23.690
So we've got all three amazing charts that we can put into our final report for the stakeholders.

155
00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:28.680
And as you can see I didn't take that long at all after we've done the preparation the vessel's session

156
00:10:28.690 --> 00:10:31.610
done analysis are very very easy.

157
00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.850
And I hope you enjoyed these tutorials I hope you enjoyed the preparation part and also this visualization

158
00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:38.990
quick exercise.

159
00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:46.770
And I look forward to seeing you further down in the course and until next time happy coding.
