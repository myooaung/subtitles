00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:05.790
Learn.

2
00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.240
Welcome back to the advanced course in our program.

3
00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:10.170
And today we're talking about lists.

4
00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.510
So let's jump straight into it at the top over here I've copied in the deliverable for this section

5
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:20.100
and we need to deliver a list with the following components.

6
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.970
Now I know that we haven't talked about lists yet and we don't even know what they are.

7
00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:28.980
But at the same time let's go through the components because they will be familiar with them.

8
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:35.550
And as we go through them it will kind of start helping us build a picture of what enlistees.

9
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:43.110
So we need to deliver a character which will be the machine name a vector which will contain the mean

10
00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:50.280
minimum Amine and the maximum utilization for the month for that machine excluding the unknown hours

11
00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.090
.

12
00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:59.160
Then we need to do deliver a logical value which will tell the reader of this information whether utilization

13
00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.370
has ever fallen below 90 percent within that month.

14
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.070
So it has to be a true false value.

15
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:09.720
Then we need to deliver another vector which contains all hours where he told zation is unknown.

16
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:16.170
So basically NA's in our data for that specific machine then we need to deliver a data frame for this

17
00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.930
mission so kind of a subset of our original doorframe and then we need to deliver a plot which will

18
00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.080
contain visuals for all of the machines.

19
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.310
So as you can see when we go through all these elements we know each one of them we've talked about

20
00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.470
characters vector's logicals Viktors doorframes and plot's.

21
00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:38.420
The only question is how do they all become components of a list and what does that mean.

22
00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.630
Well that's what we'll find out in this section of the course.

23
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.630
But for now let's get started reflowing the data and preparing for our analysis.

24
00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.580
All right so here I've got the magic lines of setting a working directory.

25
00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.960
We've done this many times already so let's just go ahead and run the correct line.

26
00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:59.520
So check it working directory if it is not the correct part for me as you can see it's really the correct

27
00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.000
path.

28
00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.740
Then just run one of these lines if you're on a Mac then a line like this.

29
00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.780
And if you're on Windows then something like that.

30
00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.060
And once you've run your line just make sure that the working directory is correct.

31
00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.550
So that should be the folder where you put the file that you downloaded for the section.

32
00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:23.350
All right so now let's create a doorframe and load our data in there.

33
00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:30.830
So we're just going to call you til short for utilization and we're going say read dot CSV here same

34
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:38.490
machine you delete zation dot SEUS we run that line there we can see that our utilizations over there

35
00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.580
and now we can actually get rid of these windows.

36
00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:42.800
We don't really need them.

37
00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.950
As you can see in this course we're getting quite advanced.

38
00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:50.030
We're just working with the main window and the console most of the time.

39
00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.930
And by the way that's also a reason why it's good to have the console underneath because you can very

40
00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.640
quickly get rid of Windows on the right which you don't need sometimes.

41
00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.120
So there we go oh Util data set is there.

42
00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.860
Now let's check the top couple of rows that say 12.

43
00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.550
What do they look like.

44
00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:15.260
So here you can see that we've got a time stamp the machine name and the percentage of idle.

45
00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:21.320
So the percentage of utilization that was idle in that specific hour.

46
00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:21.980
OK.

47
00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:23.040
So that's good.

48
00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.120
Now let's look at SDR for you still.

49
00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:29.830
So we've got time stamp machine percent idle.

50
00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:30.330
Great.

51
00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.530
And let's have a look at summary for you still.

52
00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:34.770
All right.

53
00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:36.990
There we go so machine names.

54
00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:42.590
This is a good check right away is quite useful so far isn't that useful in this case.

55
00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:50.370
But a summary is useful because we can see that each machine has 720 records which is good meaning that's

56
00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:51.600
one hour.

57
00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:57.950
So every single hour of the month has a record for each one of these machines.

58
00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:02.610
It be a bit odd if one of them had more or less than percent idle.

59
00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.550
So you've got the percentages which might be useful.

60
00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:10.500
So but the other important thing here is that we do have quite a few names and timestamp.

61
00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:18.150
It is recognized as a factor at this stage but that is something we will talk about in an upcoming tutorial

62
00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.540
.

63
00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:24.320
For now what we do need to do is when we're talking about utilization in this section of the course

64
00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.590
right.

65
00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:31.470
But in order to say we've only got a percentage idle capacity for that specific hour so better look

66
00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:32.560
at this part.

67
00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:39.330
So here we can see that 1.9 percent 1.9 percent 2.1 percent 1.3 percent.

68
00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:44.440
So all of this is like the bad stuff how the machine was not working.

69
00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:51.840
What we need is the utilization So we need one minus this number so this is if the maximum is 100 percent

70
00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:57.210
then this is how much it wasn't working in that hour or so we need to subtract that from 100 percent

71
00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:57.240
.

72
00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.870
So let's go ahead and derive utilization call them.

73
00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:08.520
So here we're going to practice a little bit how to add columns to our door frame so we how are you

74
00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.720
.

75
00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:09.490
All right.

76
00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:11.520
And how do we add in your column.

77
00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:17.990
Well just basically we're just going say dollar sign utilization we will treat it as if it's already

78
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:18.390
there.

79
00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:22.930
So one minus you till almost 9 percent idle.

80
00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:28.460
If we run that and now we have a look at the top rolls for it all.

81
00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:34.060
You'll see that we've got and you call them utilization which is equal to 1 minus percent idle.

82
00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.960
So that's a bit of data preparation for us and now we have something to work.

83
00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:42.450
You've got these time stamps we've got the utilization with the machine name.

84
00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:45.910
And from here we can proceed with our analysis.

85
00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:48.810
All right as loaded a bit of preparation done.

86
00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:53.310
And I look forward to seeing an external Until then happy coding
