00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:06.010
Hello.

2
00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:10.470
Welcome back to the advanced course and our programming in this tutorial we've got another challenge

3
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:14.180
ahead of us and we're talking about machine equalisation.

4
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.140
Let's have a look at the project brief.

5
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:22.090
All right so you have been engaged as a data scientist consultant by a coal terminal.

6
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.900
They would like to invest in one of their heavy machines which is called Our old one.

7
00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:31.860
You have been supplied with a one month worth of data for all of their machines.

8
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.680
The data says shows what percentage of capacity for each machine was idle or unused in any given hour

9
00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:38.020
.

10
00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.410
You're required to deliver an R list with the following components.

11
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.510
A character with the machine name a vector of the minimum mean and maximum utilizations a logical telling

12
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.990
us whether utilization has ever fallen Bunol 90 percent a vector which contains all ours where utilization

13
00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.790
is unknown a doorframe.

14
00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.390
So a subset of GOODFRIEND front of the specific machine and a plot for all the machines.

15
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:09.000
Now I know we haven't talked about lists yet at all but at the same time it's just important for us

16
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.760
to have these components listed so we know what we are working towards and basically think of it this

17
00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.700
way that by the end of this section will have some sort of daughter object or data structure that will

18
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.260
contain all this information within itself and that will be all lists.

19
00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.880
And of course throughout the sexual We will learn much better and in much more detail what exactly lists

20
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.190
are and how it is structured.

21
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:37.020
But for now we've got this challenge ahead of us and we're going to start solving it as soon as we dive

22
00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.330
into the section.

23
00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.440
And now let's proceed to the data set.

24
00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.230
Let's go and see where we can get this data set.

25
00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:50.220
So to get the data set as usual we need to go to w w w dot superdad assigns dot com slash are of course

26
00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.190
one word hyphen advanced.

27
00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.330
And if you scroll down here to Section Three lists and you'll see the challenge which we just looked

28
00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.750
at and the machine utilization data set.

29
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.720
So go ahead and download that and we'll investigate it.

30
00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.680
Now a little bit in a bit more detail.

31
00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:14.280
So here we've got three columns and a lot of rows so we've got like 3600 rows I think in total in this

32
00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.220
data set.

33
00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:16.350
And why is that.

34
00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.730
Well it's because we've got quite a few machines here you've got the machine name and the second column

35
00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.750
.

36
00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.330
So these are all one the one we're going to be investing in is our old two and so on.

37
00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:32.820
And at the same time for every machine you've got a record for every single hour of that month which

38
00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.670
it looks like September 2016.

39
00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:43.200
So you've got a new record for every hour in that month and that's where so many records come from.

40
00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.870
So that's important the machine name.

41
00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.730
Then of course the time stamp is important.

42
00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.830
And we're going to learn how to deal with these as well.

43
00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:55.170
And then percent idle actually tells us what percentage of capacity was unused for that machine.

44
00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.770
So for instance this machine could have done 100 percent let's say in that hour.

45
00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.060
It could have done X amount of work and that would take x' 100 percent.

46
00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:09.540
3 percent of X was unused it could have done it only did 97 percent of what it could have done in that

47
00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.780
hour.

48
00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.990
That's what this means and we're going to be analyzing that.

49
00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:14.520
So there we go that's a data set.

50
00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:19.630
And that's really it's you can now proceed with this section.

51
00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:23.860
But what I did want to do is I'm going to throw in a little bonus now.

52
00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:24.330
All right.

53
00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:31.800
So at the end of this video I'm going to add in the video that I had for this Dardus is not exactly

54
00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:38.490
this data set but very similar data set so the grandfather of this data said in a different course in

55
00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.650
a course called Advanced Tablo which I also run.

56
00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:47.190
And there I explained the background of the data set.

57
00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:54.570
So there I talk about what coal mining is and what this coal terminal does why it's so important for

58
00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:59.520
them to look at utilization how we can apply data science to measure these incredible things that we

59
00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.430
don't even understand like.

60
00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.680
And there's lots of photos lots of pictures in their presentation.

61
00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.050
I'm sure you'll love it so if you haven't done that tabloid ones of course yet then definitely stick

62
00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.660
around and have a look at their presentation.

63
00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:17.420
Just make sure to ignore the challenge itself so ignore the challenge in that presentation.

64
00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.930
You're going to see just now because we have our own challenge.

65
00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:26.760
Our challenge is kind of a spin off from that challenge but do pay attention to the domain knowledge

66
00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.940
that you'll be acquiring through our presentation.

67
00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:32.950
I'm sure gonna have lots of fun and I will see you on the next Tauriel.

68
00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:34.330
Until then happy coding.

69
00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:35.300
Enjoy.

70
00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:36.060
All right.

71
00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.510
Section 3 lezzy into the challenge.

72
00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:39.920
Are you excited about this.

73
00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.380
I'm super excited.

74
00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:42.990
Ok coal mining.

75
00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:44.730
Let's start with this question.

76
00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.850
What are the odds that you are an expert in coal mining.

77
00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.430
I would say probably 0.1 percent.

78
00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:54.000
No actually I would say zero point zero or 1 percent.

79
00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.460
That's the chance that you're an expert coalmining.

80
00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:02.260
And yet in this whole section throughout the section we're going to be talking a lot about coal mining

81
00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:07.130
and we will be leveraging specific knowledge about coal mining.

82
00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:14.730
So what that'll show you is how important domain knowledge is in the work of a data scientist or a Tablo

83
00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:15.690
analyst.

84
00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:21.690
More importantly what you will see in this tutorial is how quickly we as not a scientists can develop

85
00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.230
this domain knowledge to help us in our engagements.

86
00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:32.010
And that combined with your unique Datto skills will allow you to deliver incredible projects for virtually

87
00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:33.360
any industry.

88
00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.310
All right let's jump straight into it.

89
00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:36.810
So here's the challenge.

90
00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:39.300
And there's lots of techs here but we'll skip all of it.

91
00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:44.460
The first thing that jumps out at you is of course millions of dollars and makes it exciting but we'll

92
00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:50.370
skip it for now because there is a lot of information here which we just cannot digest We don't have

93
00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:55.830
the domain knowledge to understand exactly what is being said and what has been required of us.

94
00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:58.010
And also we're going to skip this page as well.

95
00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:03.750
Let's jump into acquiring this domain knowledge and you'll see how quickly you can develop it.

96
00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:04.170
All right.

97
00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:10.430
So here's a short clip and as you have already gathered I am assuming you have already gathered.

98
00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:12.570
I'm from Australia I'm from Brisbane.

99
00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:16.480
This is where I'm sitting right now as I'm recording this video.

100
00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:18.850
And here is the Bowen Basin.

101
00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:19.850
It's highlighted in red.

102
00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:24.690
The Bowen Basin is one of the biggest coal mining basins in the world.

103
00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:31.290
It's got lots of different types of coal and Australian mines that and exports lots of it to other countries

104
00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:31.790
.

105
00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:35.750
Now this is what a bone base in coal mine looks like.

106
00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:41.610
Now there's like I said there's lots of different types of coal and the whole concept is that it is

107
00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:45.810
mind by different companies and then it's put onto trains which look like this.

108
00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:52.980
And in this coal is sent off and these trains they can be huge they can be up to several kilometres

109
00:06:52.980 --> 00:07:00.660
in length and they can carry all the way up to 10 or even 12 a thousand tons of coal in a one train

110
00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:00.710
.

111
00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.380
It's an incredible amount.

112
00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:08.100
And they're moving at very high speeds and they're going and where are they going where are these trains

113
00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:08.350
going.

114
00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:14.490
Well they're going towards the ocean they're going towards the coast to get into a coal terminal and

115
00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:20.940
then so that the coal will be loaded onto ships and it'll be shipped off to the purchaser of that call

116
00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:21.160
.

117
00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:27.840
So where are these terminals located now in the circle here you can see one of the or several of the

118
00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:31.280
coal terminals that are highlighted now in this section.

119
00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:38.150
We're going to be pretending and I stress we're pretending that we are working for a coal terminal called

120
00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:40.290
the Dalrymple Bay coal terminal.

121
00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:45.730
And why I say pretending is because everything that we're doing is based on fake Dadda fake concepts

122
00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:45.960
.

123
00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:51.780
It's all made up just for specifically for our analytics training purposes.

124
00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:57.090
This is just a an example of has nothing to do of the real life and hence there's a disclaimer here

125
00:07:57.090 --> 00:07:57.900
at the bottom.

126
00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:03.030
This is a mock up assignment used exclusively for analytics training purposes all door used for this

127
00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:04.160
analysis is fake.

128
00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:06.340
There is no affiliation with DBC.

129
00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:08.770
So just so we're on the same page.

130
00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:10.590
This is not real data.

131
00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:13.470
We're doing this just for training purposes.

132
00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:19.400
All right so the coal from the bone Basin which is over here is outlined in the square.

133
00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:27.620
It all well a lot of it goes to this DBC Dalrymple Bay coal terminal which Lakotah here near Makai.

134
00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:33.480
And I actually wasn't Mikhail's doing an engagement for a big client there of course it was a different

135
00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:39.930
client but I have been there and I've seen the Dalrymple Bay coal terminal and this is what it looks

136
00:08:39.930 --> 00:08:40.230
like.

137
00:08:40.290 --> 00:08:45.620
So this is the view you get when you're flying in a play from Brisbane to Makai or back.

138
00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:47.480
Magnificent view isn't it.

139
00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:53.540
And so this is the Dalrymple Bay coal terminal and this is where the trains pull up.

140
00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:55.320
Well in fact they don't actually pull up.

141
00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:56.840
They're still moving.

142
00:08:56.850 --> 00:09:02.700
And while they're moving they're being unloaded over here and the coal goes down these conveyor belts

143
00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:06.950
to the stockyard over here whereas it's stockpiled.

144
00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:13.950
And then after that it is sent down more conveyor belts all the way to the jetty where it is loaded

145
00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:18.360
onto ships and then the ships go back to the person of the call.

146
00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:25.110
Now don't confuse there's another stockyard over here but this stockyard belongs to a different coal

147
00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:31.320
terminal so this coal terminal here is called the hay point coal terminal and it belongs to BMA and

148
00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:37.950
BMA stands for BHP Billiton Mitsubishi alliance so those two companies built their own coal terminal

149
00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:43.010
as you can see they've got their own carrousel here with the trains unload the coal and then it's a

150
00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:46.150
stockyard and they've got a GED over here as well.

151
00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:50.960
We're going to be pretending that we're working with that Dalrymple Bay coal terminal not the Hi-Point

152
00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:52.000
coal terminal.

153
00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:52.410
All right.

154
00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:53.950
So what else do we have here.

155
00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:56.310
This is how the coal terminal operates.

156
00:09:56.450 --> 00:10:02.660
So trains come in they're unloaded and coal goes down the conveyor belt and into the stockyard where

157
00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:05.940
these machines as you can see here they stockpile them.

158
00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:07.360
And how did they start Paula.

159
00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:09.800
Well this is how they stockpiled them.

160
00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:14.120
Another real image from the BCT terminal.

161
00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:21.320
And what you can see here is lots and lots of coal that has been stockpiled into these pyramids.

162
00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:23.980
And why do the machines into the coal.

163
00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:28.920
The question is why can't the coal just be sent directly to the Jedi.

164
00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:30.410
So let's go back one slide.

165
00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:35.240
Sometimes the coal can be sent directly to just so you can see that the conveyor belts can go around

166
00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:39.820
the machines and can go off straight to the jetty to the ships.

167
00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:41.360
But there are two issues.

168
00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:45.930
First of all maybe the ship the right ship isn't there maybe the right ship hasn't arrived yet.

169
00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:49.690
And the Cole shouldn't be at the jetty yet.

170
00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:52.370
There is a different ship being loaded at the time.

171
00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:57.200
The other thing is that train sometimes might be late so you want to stockpile the call in advance the

172
00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:59.680
companies that are sending the coal using these trains.

173
00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:04.820
They want to bring the coal in advance if they can so in case the train is late they're not paying extra

174
00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:10.760
cash because these companies have huge contracts with the ships and every time every minute of the ship's

175
00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:17.720
time that is standing there and it's delayed is literally costing hundreds of thousands of dollars for

176
00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:18.600
a minute.

177
00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:25.400
And the other thing is that there are different types of coal so you cannot you can sometimes you can

178
00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:27.130
just send the coal you have to mix.

179
00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:30.820
It has to be a blend of two three or many different types of coal.

180
00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:32.720
And that blending happens at the jetty.

181
00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:38.630
But you need to have that different those different types of coal so they're stockpiled in their own

182
00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:44.120
piles with different types of coal stockpiled separately and then when the time comes to mix them they're

183
00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:45.520
mixed at the jetty.

184
00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:48.110
So that is another reason why it is so public.

185
00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:52.440
Also as you can see inevitably going to have to have a stockyard and you're going to have to stockpile

186
00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:53.080
cold.

187
00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:58.820
So there's a stockyard and this is what the stockyard looks like over here and we'll get back to this

188
00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:01.760
image just down the track in a couple of slides.

189
00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:07.280
This here what we can see is the conveyor belt going to the jetty with the ships are and this is an

190
00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:13.350
actual photo so as you can see it's an incredibly long conveyor belt.

191
00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:18.530
And then over here there's more machines that mix the coal so there's machines here as you can see.

192
00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:24.590
These machines they stock pile the coal and there's more machines here that mix the coal and make sure

193
00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:28.730
that the coal consistency is correct.

194
00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:34.430
It's what the client ordered and the KLISE can be huge companies that can be countries that can be governments

195
00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:34.730
.

196
00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:40.790
And once that coal is correct it's loaded onto the ships and then it's sent off.

197
00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:47.240
OK I hope you get a side of this like I can feel your excitement through through the computer and I

198
00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:51.110
hope you can feel mine because this is going to be an incredible engagement.

199
00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:53.060
All right so where are we up to.

200
00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:58.430
Once again this is the photo and you can see the ships lined up over there waiting.

201
00:12:58.430 --> 00:13:02.150
So this is this place this coal terminal.

202
00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:03.770
It operates 24/7.

203
00:13:03.770 --> 00:13:08.370
It doesn't stop there is no public holidays no Christmas no anything.

204
00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:11.970
It works 24/7 365 days a year.

205
00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:14.050
Night day no breaks nothing.

206
00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:17.020
It has to keep pumping because the trains are coming.

207
00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:18.320
The ships are waiting.

208
00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:25.490
The coal needs to be sent off and there are there is so much coal it costs lots of money every minute

209
00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:28.030
that this place doesn't work.

210
00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:33.340
It's literally millions of dollars of revenue that are being lost.

211
00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:41.000
Off the bottom line of the company as you can imagine this is a very very kind of stressful work and

212
00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:48.140
I really do respect the management because they have to run this whole operation and manage both trains

213
00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:53.320
and ships and stockyards and machines is just an incredible job that they're doing.

214
00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:55.470
So hats off to them.

215
00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:57.280
And what does that mean for us.

216
00:13:57.290 --> 00:14:01.070
Well that is slowly leading us into our engagement.

217
00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:03.890
This place works 24/7.

218
00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:07.750
So by the way that's the ship's wedding this is an out and other actual photo.

219
00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:08.840
They're waiting to get loaded.

220
00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:10.370
These ships are massive.

221
00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:18.530
They can carry between anywhere between 20000 tons and 200000 tons of dead weight and dead weight includes

222
00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:22.110
all the cargo all the ballast all the people everything that's on the ship.

223
00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:24.380
And that's that's huge.

224
00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:27.330
So those ships are loaded then they're sent off.

225
00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:36.080
Now this place as we said operates 24 7 and they process eighty five million tons of coal per year.

226
00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:45.170
It doesn't probably sound like anything but that is that is an incredible amount of coal that is going

227
00:14:45.170 --> 00:14:45.500
through here.

228
00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:49.290
Just imagine one train is only about seven thousand tons.

229
00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:49.640
That's.

230
00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:53.740
And the ship maximum maximum capacity of a ship is about 200000 tons.

231
00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:58.010
So this place is producing 85 million tons of coal per year.

232
00:14:58.030 --> 00:14:59.520
It's incredible anyway.

233
00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:01.650
So moving on.

234
00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:06.960
That's what we're going to be talking about is machines that work at the coal terminal.

235
00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:11.480
We're going to be analyzing machines and specifically we're going to be talking about their maintenance

236
00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:11.740
.

237
00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:13.900
And there are three types of machines.

238
00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:17.150
There's this machine that you see here is called the Stacher.

239
00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:22.180
It stacks up the coal into these Perelman's of coal.

240
00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:25.320
Then this machine that you see here is every.

241
00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:30.860
It uses its buckets Wilderspin to reclaim the coal and send it back off onto the conveyor when that

242
00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:36.830
coal is required and then this machine is a Stacher reclaim or it can do both.

243
00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:42.140
You can see the buckets so it can reclaim but at the moment you can see it's doing is it's stacking

244
00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:44.010
the coal into a pyramid.

245
00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:46.000
So it's kind of a two way machine.

246
00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:49.930
And here you can see how the coal is sent into the machine.

247
00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:51.650
It's sent through this conveyor belt.

248
00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:55.470
Or that's the same way it goes out when it's being reclaimed.

249
00:15:55.610 --> 00:15:58.130
And this is what the place looks like at night.

250
00:15:58.130 --> 00:16:01.070
So as you can imagine these machines are working 24/7.

251
00:16:01.070 --> 00:16:04.030
The whole place lights up like a Christmas tree.

252
00:16:04.070 --> 00:16:06.210
Everybody keeps working through the night.

253
00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:09.540
And this is how the machine is working.

254
00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:10.790
Like a real time.

255
00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.080
Look at them go it's just insane how much power there is in there.

256
00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:19.060
And as you can imagine these machines require maintenance.

257
00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:20.660
They require service.

258
00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:25.580
But how are you going to service them when this whole place so they can stop they have to keep working

259
00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:28.240
24/7 because of the.

260
00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:33.050
Every every minute of downtime is millions of dollars you can't just stop them to assess whether they

261
00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:38.120
require service where they require maintenance where they need an oil change oil or whatever they might

262
00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:38.500
need.

263
00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:40.490
So how are we going to go about that.

264
00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:45.960
We're going to use analytics to find out whether my machine requires maintenance.

265
00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:52.730
And what you see here is the older machines that are present in this terminal.

266
00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:57.320
So you've got the Arel is a Clamer there's to reclaim is already here.

267
00:16:57.590 --> 00:17:03.530
Then you've got the stackers these are the three SE1 asked for and then you've got the rest which are

268
00:17:03.530 --> 00:17:10.210
Stackridge claimers So the combined machines as Sarwan as are two or three a four a five and six.

269
00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:11.360
Isn't that exciting.

270
00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:17.450
We're going to be using data to assess the performance of machines that are so complex.

271
00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:20.090
We don't know anything about our engineers.

272
00:17:20.090 --> 00:17:26.090
We never built these machines we never been inside these machines and yet we will be able to tell using

273
00:17:26.090 --> 00:17:31.490
data whether they require maintenance or not and that by is on its own is incredible.

274
00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:32.980
That is the power of data mining.

275
00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:37.920
And I look forward to seeing on the first tutorial Let's get this thing started and until then have

276
00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:38.600
happy analyzing
