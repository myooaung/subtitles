Hello and welcome back to the course of our program and this session we're talking about lists.

2
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.080
Lists are a structure in are which are very two vectors.

3
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:18.510
But at the same time they are different in the way that they can allow any type of data to be stored

4
00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:19.130
in the list.

5
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.780
Remember how vectors can only have one single type of datastore in within themselves so the kind can

6
00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:31.380
be integers or doubles or it can be logical values or can be characters and so on.

7
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:33.060
Well this are different.

8
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.710
They can you can store anything in any combination so you can have the vector with the least you can

9
00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:44.610
have a vector you can have a matrix you can have a time frame you could have a plot in silence you could

10
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.950
have just a single value you could have lots of different Mace's all datatypes.

11
00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:55.110
And that's why they are a very powerful tool for storing data.

12
00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.240
And that's what we've been focusing on in this section.

13
00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:02.190
So we're going to learn about this and learn how to use them how to create them how to measure them

14
00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.470
how to get them how to rename them how to perform all sorts of different types of operations including

15
00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.140
how to access Lith's and how to subset lists at the same time.

16
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:18.450
We will see how the practical side of it will be how lists are used for storage and so there are other

17
00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.530
use cases of lists.

18
00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.920
And you will find out about the second one in the section about life the functions.

19
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.930
But in this one we're just focusing on how to use Lisp for starters because that is kind of the simpler

20
00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:36.430
application of list and it will help us get up to speed with this new concept here.

21
00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.500
So 0.11 total that is going to be a fun and exciting section.

22
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.790
We're going to learn a brand new structure in our
