00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.560
Well-considered course in our programming I'm super excited that you decided to join this class.

2
00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.220
So what's this course all about.

3
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.570
Well this course is about advanced features of our and advanced techniques.

4
00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.020
So our has lots of different features that are considered to be advanced like for instance lists or

5
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.290
apply family functions or corporations all those things that we're going to be talking about in this

6
00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:28.760
course.

7
00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:35.670
But at the same time you need to know how to use them correctly for them to turn into those advanced

8
00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.080
techniques so one thing is knowing those features.

9
00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:42.860
The other thing is actually applying them to maximize their potential.

10
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.280
And that's what this class is about.

11
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.640
It's about learning those tools that are has for your disposal and actually knowing and learning how

12
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.430
to apply them.

13
00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:56.320
And moreover practicing those application to have lots of different exercises.

14
00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.320
We're going to be analyzing whether trends we're going to be cleaning data we're going to be looking

15
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:08.310
at different data on machine maintenance so lots of different projects from different worlds of analytics

16
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.770
and they will allow us to see how to apply those advanced skills in the real world.

17
00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.770
And of course we're going to have lots of fun along the way.

18
00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.710
That's how this cost structure.

19
00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.940
So just make sure to follow along with the code because that is probably the most important part that

20
00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:29.490
you fall on the court and it gets that hands on practical application so you get that experience of

21
00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.950
coding and are because then you can always tweak your code a little bit explore what happens if you

22
00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.140
change this or that and that's how you ultimately learn a new programming language or a new analytics

23
00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.300
tool like our.

24
00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:46.110
And now I'm going to jump behind the computer and I'll show you around the score so that you can navigate

25
00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.330
it a little bit better.

26
00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.350
And I'll see on the other side.

27
00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.620
All right so let's have a look at the course structure right now.

28
00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:54.360
We're over here we're into Tauriel 1.

29
00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:56.800
Welcome to the was our programming course.

30
00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:02.240
And next we will move on to the section titled A data preparation.

31
00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.530
So at the start of every section there is a quick tutorial where I will discuss what we're going to

32
00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:13.430
study in the section and in this specific section we're going to talk about quite a lot of things.

33
00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.190
So the focus here is on preparing our own are and we're going to learn how to.

34
00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.250
Of course we're going to review how to import data into are we going to have an interesting project

35
00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:29.340
it's going to be a Financial Review type of product so we're going to be working with a financial data

36
00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:36.210
for quite a few different companies 500 different companies then we're going to talk about factors the

37
00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:41.790
fact factor variable trap a very important tutorial here so definitely check that one out can save you

38
00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.290
a lot of problems if you do know about the effects of variable trap in a.

39
00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:51.060
Then we'll have an example of that trap then we'll talk about some new functions we'll learn how to

40
00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:57.000
deal with missing data and then the rest of this section is devoted to methods of dealing with missing

41
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.550
daughter replacing it substituting it calculating it.

42
00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:05.410
And one of the main techniques discussed here is the median imputation method.

43
00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:10.810
So that will be quite interesting and there'll be a lot of hands on practice and of course and we'll

44
00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:18.150
have a tutorial devoted to just visualizing the results to see what insights we can actually extract

45
00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:21.470
from the findings from the data that we have.

46
00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.710
Then at the end of every section you'll see that there is also a section a recap to recap all the things

47
00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:31.750
that we've learned in the following section we've got a list in our So a introductory section to lists

48
00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.110
will I say introductory but that's just because that's the first time we're going to be encountering

49
00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.580
lists.

50
00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:42.860
But at the same time we're going to be learning quite sophisticated things that we're beat when we're

51
00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.650
dealing with lists so we'll learn how to use lists for storage.

52
00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.950
We also learn how to handle date times in our in this section.

53
00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:57.150
Then we will learn how to do some basic stuff of lists like naming components of a list and deleting

54
00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.250
adding And we'll also learn how to extract components from a list.

55
00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.730
And we'll also learn about subsetting a list which is an important topic and then we will learn how

56
00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.170
to create a time series plot in our.

57
00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:16.650
And finally we move on to this section on a ply family of functions in our So here we're going to be

58
00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:17.790
talking about weather patterns.

59
00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:22.080
That's our project and we're going to learn a lot.

60
00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:28.350
So we're going to learn how to apply family works how to use apply how to use apply how to use air supply

61
00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:34.980
we will also learn how to combine apply with the square brackets operator which is probably it's an

62
00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:39.270
advance technique but it's the the most basic out of the once techniques are all learned we'll also

63
00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:44.970
learn how to nest your own functions within apply folks and we'll even learn how to nest apply functions

64
00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:50.000
inside apply functions and then we will have a very very advanced topic here.

65
00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:55.110
We've got two advanced topics in the section with the recreating the Apply function loops which is moderately

66
00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:00.320
advanced and then we have a very advanced topic here which Max and the which men function functions

67
00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:06.270
by themselves and not that advanced but when you look at the example it'll be using will it'll be a

68
00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:07.450
little Be kind.

69
00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:13.320
Way inception type of Nestea example will be nesting one of those functions and apply functions out

70
00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:19.770
of an L apply function and it'll be very quite recursive in that sense so you'll be a good tutorial

71
00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:22.880
to finish off this section and to test our knowledge.

72
00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:27.930
So there we go those are the main topics we are discussing in this course.

73
00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:31.260
Hope you enjoyed and hope you have fun along the way.

74
00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:32.610
I can't wait to get started.

75
00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:36.100
So let's jump straight into the next tutorial.

76
00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.090
I look forward to seeing you there and until next AM HAPPY coding

77
00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:43.440
.
