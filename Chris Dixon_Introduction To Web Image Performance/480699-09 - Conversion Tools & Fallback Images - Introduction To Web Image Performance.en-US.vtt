00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:07.140
Now we know a little more about the different types of image file types available.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.430
Now let's take a look at how we can add these to our project and also

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:16.065
how we can add fallback images if there is no browser support.

00:00:16.065 --> 00:00:19.560
For this lesson head into number 6,

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.545
which is conversion tools and fallback images.

00:00:22.545 --> 00:00:25.140
Open up as ever the Index page,

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.160
and then we can open this up inside of the browser,

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.575
place this into a new tab.

00:00:31.575 --> 00:00:34.725
I'm going to start with our blank HTML page.

00:00:34.725 --> 00:00:38.940
Inside here, I've provided a list of some of the common image types,

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.350
we have the WebP,

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.765
we have the SVG, PNG,

00:00:42.765 --> 00:00:44.785
JPEG, and also GIF.

00:00:44.785 --> 00:00:47.900
Again, for switching between different image types,

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.110
the picture elements it has is covered by [inaudible]

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.120
list out various images with different formats.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.510
Still provide the source elements as we've done previously,

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.240
but this time, rather than working with the size,

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.250
we declared the file type,

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.270
browser or device will then check if this file type is supported,

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:07.325
and if not, it will be skipped.

00:01:07.325 --> 00:01:10.430
Using these image formats which we have just here,

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.335
let's start with our example.

00:01:12.335 --> 00:01:15.140
We can use the picture element as our wrapper,

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.720
for this example over in images we have a JPEG,

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.010
and a WebP version of the same image, so let's add these in.

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.865
We need a source,

00:01:26.865 --> 00:01:30.795
then inside here, we add the type attributes.

00:01:30.795 --> 00:01:34.660
We can then use any of these ones used to both,

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:38.420
I'm going to go for the WebP version, which is image/webp.

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.600
Then we add the sources point to the WebP image.

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.150
After this, we also need to take care of our fall back,

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.520
which is our bridge.jpg,

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.040
add in the image elements.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.815
This is in the images and the bridge.jpg.

00:01:58.815 --> 00:02:00.670
If WebP is supported,

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.310
this image will be selected.

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.130
If not, it will easily fall back inside of the image elements.

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.490
Let's try this out, refresh the browser.

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:15.190
We can see inside of the developer tools that my browser has chosen the WebP version.

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.860
For me this would be a benefit because this will load faster.

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.230
If we take a look at the bridge.jpg,

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:22.625
we can see down at the bottom,

00:02:22.625 --> 00:02:25.775
that this is about 134 kilobytes.

00:02:25.775 --> 00:02:27.630
If we go to the WebP version,

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.630
this is around by 1-10 kilobytes,

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.510
so this will result in a file saving and my images will download faster.

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.674
This is really useful, but when we're looking for images to use in our projects,

00:02:38.674 --> 00:02:43.865
we don't always have the option to download our images in different file formats.

00:02:43.865 --> 00:02:47.165
This is fine because there are some tools to help us convert,

00:02:47.165 --> 00:02:49.450
and also compress our images.

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.095
I'm using a mark, and this has some options built in when opening up the images.

00:02:54.095 --> 00:02:56.660
If we go into number six,

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:02.345
which we are currently on, insert images and double-click on any one of these images.

00:03:02.345 --> 00:03:05.195
This will then open up inside the preview.

00:03:05.195 --> 00:03:08.660
Don't worry if you aren't using a mark if you're using Windows or Linux,

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.400
your default program which opens up

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.625
the image may also have some of these options built into.

00:03:13.625 --> 00:03:17.375
If not, we'll take a look at some more options in just a moment.

00:03:17.375 --> 00:03:21.980
As most symbol, we can go into tools and adjust the size.

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.780
We can reduce down the file size if this particular image is a little bit too big,

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.035
and we can see the resulting file size has been reduced.

00:03:30.035 --> 00:03:32.985
Which changes to be 300.

00:03:32.985 --> 00:03:36.264
You can see this has been reduced down to 50 kilobytes,

00:03:36.264 --> 00:03:38.750
which changes to be 300.

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.310
It's now down to 30 kilobytes.

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.560
It's most basic, we can just do something like this to reduce down

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.275
the file size if the initial download is too big.

00:03:48.275 --> 00:03:53.885
Most programs also allow us to export the images in different formats too.

00:03:53.885 --> 00:03:56.980
Many of these generally have an export function which we can

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.160
click on and we can often change the image format,

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.100
so we see the file size is 157 here,

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:05.320
which changes to be 2,000.

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:09.895
This is 216 PNG, this is a bit bigger,

00:04:09.895 --> 00:04:12.475
and also the file sizes which support compression,

00:04:12.475 --> 00:04:15.155
we can also adjust the quality too.

00:04:15.155 --> 00:04:19.220
As with most things are, there is also lots of other tools which you can download.

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:23.675
You can find a huge amount available if searching App Stores or online.

00:04:23.675 --> 00:04:27.415
A popular tool low is one called ImageOptim.

00:04:27.415 --> 00:04:30.580
This is available from imageoptim.com.

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.220
This particular piece of software is available for Mac and Linux,

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:35.540
which you can download.

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.030
This is a collection of tools which combines to

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:41.465
remove any unnecessary junk from our images.

00:04:41.465 --> 00:04:43.625
Here is a list of tools which it uses,

00:04:43.625 --> 00:04:46.115
and it's all free and open-source,

00:04:46.115 --> 00:04:48.140
so there's no charge to use this.

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:50.870
It also applies compression techniques too,

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.530
and there is also an online version which we can click on just here.

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:57.335
They do charge for this particular service.

00:04:57.335 --> 00:05:00.775
And another one is tinypng.com.

00:05:00.775 --> 00:05:05.140
Unlike ImageOptim, this is a free online compression tool.

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:07.750
You can find this at tinypng.com.

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:11.090
Despite the name, this also accept JPEG images too.

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:14.965
If we can simply drag and drop into this section just here,

00:05:14.965 --> 00:05:19.770
that other web-based drag-and-drop service is compressor.io,

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:22.095
along with PNG and JPEG.

00:05:22.095 --> 00:05:24.040
This also accepts GIF,

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:27.805
SVG, and also the newer WebP types.

00:05:27.805 --> 00:05:32.980
You can see that on the bottom here we can accept lossy or losses compression types.

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:39.065
Also a customer setting too where we can resize and also set the image quality too.

00:05:39.065 --> 00:05:43.065
Another optimizer and compressor is Img2go,

00:05:43.065 --> 00:05:46.545
this is available at img2go.com.

00:05:46.545 --> 00:05:51.650
This tool also allows us to convert the image type to other format too.

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:53.645
Works with PNG, GIFs,

00:05:53.645 --> 00:05:57.370
JPEGs, and also vectors such as SVG.

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:59.420
Just like the other ones, we can also drag and

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:01.550
drop and we'll also have some options to link

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:05.960
to Dropbox or Google Drive, a dedicated URL.

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:10.915
There's also plenty of options to set the quality and also the image size too.

00:06:10.915 --> 00:06:14.135
These are just some of the many tools available to download,

00:06:14.135 --> 00:06:16.625
and also some online versions too.

00:06:16.625 --> 00:06:21.030
We should never be stuck with the wrong image type for our project.
