00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.345
When he was now browsing the Internet on a device, just like this,

00:00:09.345 --> 00:00:13.335
what you really want to weight in on a large image to be downloaded,

00:00:13.335 --> 00:00:16.545
which was intended to be used on a large monitor.

00:00:16.545 --> 00:00:19.710
Of course, for those, and here's the problem.

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.310
Using a smaller website images will mean this will download

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.910
much faster on a smaller mobile sized devices.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.415
When scaling up to the big screen,

00:00:29.415 --> 00:00:32.395
it can look really stretched and pixelated.

00:00:32.395 --> 00:00:35.630
If we go the opposite way and start with a big image,

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.030
it may look good on a large monitor,

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.245
but it can take far too long to download on a mobile device,

00:00:41.245 --> 00:00:43.875
mostly bad user experience.

00:00:43.875 --> 00:00:50.645
So how do we efficiently add images while website suits all screen sizes and devices?

00:00:50.645 --> 00:00:55.060
We could try to use an image which has some kind of middle ground on the size.

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:58.100
But this is becoming much more difficult in screens,

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.640
again bigger, and also have a higher resolution too.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:07.100
Another way of doing this is by taking advantage of the HTML pitch elements.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.885
With picture, we can have multiple sizes of the same image,

00:01:10.885 --> 00:01:15.260
and the browser will load up the correct one based on the size of the device.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.805
So we'll take a look at this and various other techniques.

00:01:18.805 --> 00:01:21.200
We also want to make sure that we can load

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.605
different images based on the orientation of the device,

00:01:24.605 --> 00:01:27.620
the type of image formats which the browser support,

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.360
and so much more.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.095
We'll also cover lots more useful things are asked direction,

00:01:33.095 --> 00:01:35.465
different image types and how we can convert them

00:01:35.465 --> 00:01:38.240
using compression on the different compression methods,

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.540
using fallback image's, content delivery networks,

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.840
lazy loading, and lot more.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.030
If you create any type of HTML websites or applications,

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.300
then this course is ideal for you.

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.240
You don't need much experience to take this course.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.625
It is designed to be beginner friendly.

00:01:55.625 --> 00:01:59.540
Although some HTML experience will be beneficial since I

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.950
will assume you know how to set up a basic HTML page.

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.730
I hope you're interested and excited to take this course.

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:11.120
Now let's jump into the first lesson where we're going to discover

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.200
the effect tab party size images and half on the user experience.
