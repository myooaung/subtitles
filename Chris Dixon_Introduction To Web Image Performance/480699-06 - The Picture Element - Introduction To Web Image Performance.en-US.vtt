00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:07.260
These extra image attributes which we've looked at are really useful for selecting

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:13.095
the correct type of image based off the browser's width and also the pixel density.

00:00:13.095 --> 00:00:16.515
If this is all we need, then that is completely fine.

00:00:16.515 --> 00:00:19.365
However, though, if we want some more fine control,

00:00:19.365 --> 00:00:22.830
we can make use of what is called the picture element.

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.540
Well, this lesson head into number 4 which is the picture element,

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.300
and then open up the index.html page.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.480
Inside the browser, this is just a empty HTML page and we have some images as

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.015
ever on this lesson which are really going to be useful

00:00:38.015 --> 00:00:41.350
for checking out what the picture elements has to offer.

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.365
The picture element provides more flexibility if required by giving us

00:00:45.365 --> 00:00:49.805
access to the full power of media queries to select our image.

00:00:49.805 --> 00:00:53.270
This is the manual way of telling the browser which image is to

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.920
use rather than letting your browser decide as we did in previous videos.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:03.355
The picture element is simply a wrapper for various images just like this.

00:01:03.355 --> 00:01:05.850
Inside the body, we create the picture,

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.860
opening and closing tag.

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.075
This element doesn't provide any images on its own,

00:01:11.075 --> 00:01:15.565
we instead need to place in some content inside of this element.

00:01:15.565 --> 00:01:19.790
Also just like the source at which you looked at in previous videos,

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.275
the picture element is also well-supported.

00:01:23.275 --> 00:01:27.530
We have full support in all of the major browsers and like with most things,

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.120
we have a problem with Internet Explorer,

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.355
good with Microsoft systems.

00:01:31.355 --> 00:01:33.920
This has been replaced with the Edge browser so we

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.310
shouldn't have too many problems with this element.

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.040
Back to the text editor and inside of

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.280
the picture element and I'm going to add our first image.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:50.860
I must go for the images folder and the lake which is 640 pixels wide.jpeg.

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.930
As you'd expect, if we save and refresh this,

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.150
we now see this image has been loaded inside of the browser.

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.110
With this setup we're not any further down the line than we would

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.670
be by simply using a regular image element.

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.390
But what we can do when using this picture elements is to also provide

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.875
alternative images inside of one or more source elements.

00:02:12.875 --> 00:02:15.765
The source elements only has an opening tag.

00:02:15.765 --> 00:02:18.605
Since we added the data as attributes,

00:02:18.605 --> 00:02:23.390
it's used to provide media resources for not only this picture elements but you

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.450
may also see this source attribute used with the audio or video wrapper too.

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.210
When using it inside of the picture elements,

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:35.020
just like we are, the source attributes will be ignored.

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.695
The reason for this is the source attribute is not

00:02:37.695 --> 00:02:42.010
needed because we already have a fallback image just below,

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.570
but what we can add is the source set.

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:48.965
This again, takes in the images we want to use,

00:02:48.965 --> 00:02:50.735
followed by the size.

00:02:50.735 --> 00:02:54.695
We first add the file path so ours is in the Images folder.

00:02:54.695 --> 00:02:59.855
Let's go for the sun-640.jpeg.

00:02:59.855 --> 00:03:04.290
The size of the image 640w.

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:05.640
Then separated by a comma,

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.470
our second image which we are going to allow for selection is

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:14.610
the larger version of the sun which is sun-1,280.jpeg.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:21.900
Then we specify that this image is 1,280 pixels wide and I've added

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.990
the two sun images inside of here which are different to

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:29.380
the fallback image just so we can clearly see what's going on inside the browser.

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.420
Just like in the previous video,

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.630
we can also use the pixel density instead of this width.

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.735
Here we could add 2x and 4x for example,

00:03:37.735 --> 00:03:40.490
so choose which option suits you best.

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:44.630
Let's give this a save and open this up in the browser, refresh.

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.570
We'll see if we shrink the browser down to

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:50.890
the smaller size but the sun-640 will bloat it.

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:52.720
We don't see the lake because this is

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.750
just the fallback image if the source is not supported.

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.570
Let's make this a little bit bigger.

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:06.970
I keep going and then once we hit just under 500 pixels,

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.830
we see the larger version has been loaded.

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:13.370
Now this leaves us in a pretty similar position to what we've had in

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.185
the previous videos where we had

00:04:15.185 --> 00:04:18.755
a regular image element and then we added the source set.

00:04:18.755 --> 00:04:23.065
But the difference here is we can also introduce media queries.

00:04:23.065 --> 00:04:26.975
This means rather than letting the browser decide which image to display,

00:04:26.975 --> 00:04:30.305
we can serve some stricter conditions of our own.

00:04:30.305 --> 00:04:35.765
We can use any media query which we want just like we could do with regular CSS.

00:04:35.765 --> 00:04:41.630
A common one is to only display an image if the viewport is a minimum or maximum width.

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:48.925
We add the media attributes and then setup our media query in between the brackets.

00:04:48.925 --> 00:04:53.305
This one was at the minimum width equal to

00:04:53.305 --> 00:04:58.670
640 pixels and we're going to delete our larger image.

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:04.225
What this leaves us with is a source attribute,

00:05:04.225 --> 00:05:10.485
which is only going to display this image when the browser is larger than 640 pixels.

00:05:10.485 --> 00:05:16.315
If the browser is under 640 pixels and this media query condition is not met,

00:05:16.315 --> 00:05:21.110
the fallback image will be used. Let's check this out.

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:24.215
Bring this down to the smallest size and refresh.

00:05:24.215 --> 00:05:27.290
We see the lake which is the fallback image and now

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:31.410
let's stretch this to be 640 pixels or above.

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:35.580
This will now switch to the sun image.

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:40.220
Another useful thing this media query does for us is it also allows us

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:44.435
to fine-tune exactly when we want our images to switchover.

00:05:44.435 --> 00:05:46.720
Earlier when the browser was deciding,

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:50.720
it changed my picture at just under the 500 pixels mark.

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:53.090
Let just say we thought this was too early,

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:55.880
we wanted to change this to 600 pixels,

00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:01.105
well these media attributes will allow us to fine-tune this to any size which we want.

00:06:01.105 --> 00:06:04.365
To do this, we'll duplicate our source,

00:06:04.365 --> 00:06:10.210
we can re-introduce our large image which was 1,280.

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:15.650
We also need to do is set the width one here and this time, for the smaller image,

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:19.370
we're going to set the maximum width to be

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:26.135
599 pixels and then we want the larger one to take effect at 600 pixels.

00:06:26.135 --> 00:06:30.200
You could even make this higher if you wanted to but this media query will now give us

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:35.970
full control of exactly when we switch to our large image. Let's try this out.

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:37.910
If we go down to the smaller size,

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:40.415
we see the sun at 640,

00:06:40.415 --> 00:06:42.035
and then it takes it up to

00:06:42.035 --> 00:06:48.380
600 pixels and our image will now be replaced with the larger version,

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:52.085
as well as the minimum or the maximum width which we are using here,

00:06:52.085 --> 00:06:54.620
any valid media query can be used.

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:58.790
Even though we have only got one single image source for each media query,

00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:04.015
we can still use multiple sources that still fall under one single media query.

00:07:04.015 --> 00:07:07.820
An example could be when checking the device orientation.

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:10.640
This is more for mobile devices and we can check if

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:14.245
the device is rotated either landscape or portrait.

00:07:14.245 --> 00:07:20.940
To see this in action, we can change the maximum width via the orientation,

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:25.530
and this one we'll set this be a landscape.

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:30.170
We can then change the second one to the orientation of portrait

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:36.530
and now we're going to set our images to suit each one.

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:38.765
Since landscape is wider,

00:07:38.765 --> 00:07:40.790
we'll go for our two wide images,

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:44.910
which is 1,280 and 2,400.

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:49.715
Change both the image source and also the width.

00:07:49.715 --> 00:07:58.260
Let's copy this, separated by comma the second one which is for 2,400.

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:04.170
Next, the portrait view so that images will be narrower and

00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:07.695
for this we have a 320 and a 640 version.

00:08:07.695 --> 00:08:15.100
The first source of 320 then separated by a comma,

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:19.020
we can add in the 640 pixels wide version.

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:22.680
Now if we test this out in portrait mode,

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:25.310
our two smaller images should now display.

00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:27.170
When we switch this to landscape,

00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:30.145
we should then display our two large images.

00:08:30.145 --> 00:08:33.365
To simulate this, we can go over to the developer tools,

00:08:33.365 --> 00:08:36.395
and then if we click on the Toggle device toolbar,

00:08:36.395 --> 00:08:41.545
this will then allow us to select between a desktop view and a mobile device.

00:08:41.545 --> 00:08:45.540
Let's go for iPhone 6, and if we refresh,

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:49.655
we see that this small image of 640 pixels has been loaded.

00:08:49.655 --> 00:08:53.900
This icon just here will toggle the orientation to landscape,

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:59.050
refresh, and it's now chose one of the large images for the landscape view.

00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:02.850
Remember you can add as many of these source elements as you would like to,

00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:06.380
to make sure we have the best image for each situation.

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:09.650
Finally, we can also make use of these size attributes,

00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:12.260
just like we did in the previous videos.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:15.845
Remember that if no sizes attribute is added,

00:09:15.845 --> 00:09:20.935
it assumed you want all of these images to be the full width for the viewport.

00:09:20.935 --> 00:09:24.485
As an example, when using a landscape orientation,

00:09:24.485 --> 00:09:27.020
we may want to restrict some of the bigger images to

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:30.065
only be 50 percent of the screen's width.

00:09:30.065 --> 00:09:34.429
Though just like earlier, set the sizes.

00:09:34.429 --> 00:09:42.145
This is combined with a media query where we'll set the maximum width be 1,280 pixels.

00:09:42.145 --> 00:09:44.950
From zero to 1,280,

00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:48.470
we want the images to be the full width of the device with

00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:53.905
100vw and then only 50 percent wide on the larger screens.

00:09:53.905 --> 00:09:56.535
Like this and let's test this out.

00:09:56.535 --> 00:09:58.580
If we stretch the browser even wider,

00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:02.705
we won't see any difference since the iPhone has a fixed size.

00:10:02.705 --> 00:10:06.610
If we select something larger such as a iPad Pro,

00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:09.920
when we first select this in the portray view,

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:12.635
the image is the full width of the screen.

00:10:12.635 --> 00:10:17.450
This is because it falls under the maximum width of 1,280 pixels,

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:20.300
where we set the width to be 100 percent.

00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:23.014
Alternatively, if we switch this to landscape,

00:10:23.014 --> 00:10:26.780
it should now switch the image down be 50 percent.

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:31.185
Let's try this, and this is all now working as expected.

00:10:31.185 --> 00:10:35.600
The key takeaway being if you want the browser to decide which image to select,

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:37.160
use the image combined with

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:41.879
the source set or just like this if you want much more flexible control,

00:10:41.879 --> 00:10:44.475
the picture element is a great option.

00:10:44.475 --> 00:10:48.620
Another great use for the picture element is to also change the art direction

00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:53.310
of images and we're going to cover how to do this in the upcoming video.
