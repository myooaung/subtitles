00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:06.795
The examples which we have looked at so far mainly focus

00:00:06.795 --> 00:00:10.710
on the pixel density and also the resolution.

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.225
However, though the pitch element also has another great use case,

00:00:15.225 --> 00:00:17.325
and this is to adjust the image,

00:00:17.325 --> 00:00:20.190
based off what's called the art direction.

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:25.770
For this, let's head over to our starter files and into lesson Number Five.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.280
From here, the Art direction folder,

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.770
open up the index page,

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:32.030
and let's open this up,

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:36.110
inside of the browser, we'll copy the file path to this,

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.175
and then replace the one from the last video.

00:00:39.175 --> 00:00:41.960
I'm also just going to click on the toggle device toolbar

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.880
to reinstate this back to the full desktop view.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.849
All of our images so far have just been different sizes,

00:00:49.849 --> 00:00:53.690
and it's great to have a smaller and a larger version of the same image,

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:59.320
but sometimes certain images just may not suit a certain screen size.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.940
In the Images folder, inside of lesson five,

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.780
first, let's take a look at the landscape version.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.920
Here, we see somebody jumping with a wide landscape background,

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.380
and this will look good on a large monitor in my opinion,

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.525
where you can see all of the background detail.

00:01:14.525 --> 00:01:16.580
We can see the sun, we can see the mountains,

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.680
we can see the ground, but imagine this on a small device such as a phone,

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.465
since the person jumping takes up

00:01:23.465 --> 00:01:27.230
only a small percentage of the total width of the image,

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:30.505
is focused point of this person may look really small.

00:01:30.505 --> 00:01:35.645
For the mobile device instead of supplying a smaller scaled-down version of this image,

00:01:35.645 --> 00:01:39.580
it may be better to provide a cropped version of this focus point,

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.400
just like we see in the portrait version.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.430
Here, we see a vertical version which focuses on this person,

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.680
and we also see less of the background.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.805
Meaning, this person takes up a larger percentage of the total width.

00:01:52.805 --> 00:01:55.810
Therefore, it will look bigger on a mobile device.

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.065
Let's try this out.

00:01:57.065 --> 00:01:58.990
Over in the index page,

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.345
inside the body section, we have just a blank starter here.

00:02:02.345 --> 00:02:04.070
Again, to make use of this,

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:05.885
we're going to use the picture element.

00:02:05.885 --> 00:02:09.305
Then inside of here, we're going to supply two source elements,

00:02:09.305 --> 00:02:12.365
which is going to point to both of these pictures.

00:02:12.365 --> 00:02:15.575
We know we can add a media query as an attribute,

00:02:15.575 --> 00:02:17.240
then inside the brackets,

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:23.615
the first one we'll set up the maximum width be 799 pixels.

00:02:23.615 --> 00:02:28.730
Then for this smaller view, we're going to set the image with the srcset attributes,

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.400
so this is going to point to the Images folder.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.750
Then the image which we need,

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.805
since this is the smaller device,

00:02:34.805 --> 00:02:37.420
we're going to use the portrait version.

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.380
This has a dot JPEG extension.

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.375
Now, we can duplicate this.

00:02:42.375 --> 00:02:47.985
This one is going to trigger when the minimum width is 800 pixels and above.

00:02:47.985 --> 00:02:50.300
After this one, since we have more space,

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.900
we'll switch to the landscape view.

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.780
Switching between our two images like this when one is

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.620
a particular zoom level or one is a cropped version of the image,

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.760
this is what is referred to as the art direction.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.220
Since we don't have multiple sizes of these images,

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.480
we're going to set up some CSS at the top.

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:16.165
We will simply restrict the image to be a maximum width of 100 percent,

00:03:16.165 --> 00:03:19.485
and this will stop the images from stretching too wide.

00:03:19.485 --> 00:03:21.080
Also, doing this pitch element,

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.745
we need to add an image placeholder which is going to act as a default,

00:03:25.745 --> 00:03:29.815
and also the element locations place these images inside.

00:03:29.815 --> 00:03:33.020
The source, this is going to be for the fallback,

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.155
would just place in the landscape version.

00:03:36.155 --> 00:03:39.590
Give this a save, and make sure that over in the browser,

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.460
we are within the number five folder.

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:46.275
First of all, let's shrink this down to the smallest view.

00:03:46.275 --> 00:03:48.240
Because we are on the smaller view,

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.090
which is under 799 pixels,

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.315
we'll see a portray version which is focused on this person jumping.

00:03:55.315 --> 00:04:03.375
Let scale this up to over 800 pixels. There we go.

00:04:03.375 --> 00:04:04.800
Then over 800 pixels,

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:09.310
we see the full landscape version with more of the background scenery.

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.620
This art direction really gives us something to think about,

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.190
to try to put the focus onto a single part of the image.

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:20.540
Or just like in this case where we're trying not to make the key part too small.

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:25.530
Next, we'll focus our attention on the different image types available.
