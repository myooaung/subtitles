00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:06.945
When we were learning, the best way is to put things into practice.

00:00:06.945 --> 00:00:10.465
If you already have a project you can apply these techniques to,

00:00:10.465 --> 00:00:15.085
then that is great or you may have an upcoming project where you can try things out.

00:00:15.085 --> 00:00:19.320
I've also provided a basic image gallery template with this course.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.830
This is inside of folder number 9,

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.990
and inside here we have this index page and also a single image.

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:29.200
This is just a single image to get you go in and you will

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.855
need to download some more images to use for this project.

00:00:32.855 --> 00:00:35.940
Something like unsplash.com is ideal.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.480
This is just a pretty basic index page.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.770
All we have inside the body section is a single section and then multiple image elements,

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.825
and we'll set this up just above in a style section will be displayed as a grid.

00:00:48.825 --> 00:00:50.690
If we open this up inside the browser,

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.660
we can see our grid just here.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.340
What I would like you to do for this challenge is to download

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.890
some new images to use for this gallery.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.620
You can then optimize and try all the techniques which you've

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.205
learned to efficiently load them up inside the browser.

00:01:04.205 --> 00:01:06.755
There is no right or wrong way of doing this.

00:01:06.755 --> 00:01:10.190
The idea is just to try things out, to optimize images,

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:15.010
which use file sizes and generally make loading the images more efficient.

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:16.410
You could do it in batches,

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:17.855
you could apply the changes,

00:01:17.855 --> 00:01:22.250
record your results, and then repeat until you are happy with the results.

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:23.990
Good luck with this project.

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.820
I can't wait to see what you create.
