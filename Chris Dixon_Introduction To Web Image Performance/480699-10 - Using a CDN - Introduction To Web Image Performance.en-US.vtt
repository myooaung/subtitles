00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:06.300
All of this image manipulation and choosing the correct images

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.720
for our project can really be a lot of extra work,

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.120
especially as our apps grow.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.980
This is why in this video I'm going to show you a great service which is also free,

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.675
that can really help with this.

00:00:19.675 --> 00:00:23.190
We can make use of services such as Cloudinary,

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:25.920
which is available at cloudinary.com.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.805
This is going to allow us to take care of a lot of work for us.

00:00:29.805 --> 00:00:35.665
Cloudinary is used to store and host our images and also video if required too.

00:00:35.665 --> 00:00:41.039
Once uploaded, we get a URL which we can link to inside of our HTML.

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:43.350
Not only does this host our images photos,

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.525
but also has many other benefits too.

00:00:46.525 --> 00:00:51.299
All of these benefits, it's really easy to use CDN.

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:56.945
CDN is a content delivery network and it is a way of having our content,

00:00:56.945 --> 00:00:59.990
which in our case is our images available across

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:03.385
the world in multiple servers or data centers.

00:01:03.385 --> 00:01:09.275
Having these multiple data centers mean that our images hosted closer to the user,

00:01:09.275 --> 00:01:12.380
rather than just having them in one central location,

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.110
everyone in the world.

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.495
This can really speed up the delivery of our images.

00:01:17.495 --> 00:01:19.775
Also if there is an issue with the server,

00:01:19.775 --> 00:01:24.200
it can easily be switched over to a new one to avoid any downtime.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.010
Not only does it serve the image from a local data center,

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.765
but it can also provide a optimized version too.

00:01:31.765 --> 00:01:35.554
We only need to upload one single image to Cloudinary

00:01:35.554 --> 00:01:39.545
and we can convert it and send it back in a optimized file format,

00:01:39.545 --> 00:01:43.145
including things such as WebP and JPEG 2000,

00:01:43.145 --> 00:01:45.670
of course, if the browser supports it.

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.740
The same for size and quality too,

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.590
we can set these images up to be transformed into

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.415
certain sizes or allow it to choose photos.

00:01:55.415 --> 00:01:58.250
Obviously, we need to first upload an image which is big enough.

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.050
Our biggest use case,

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:04.840
since we don't want to stretch an image too big and loose any quality.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.995
If you've not used Cloudinary before,

00:02:06.995 --> 00:02:09.950
go ahead and create a new account which is free and

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.295
has a huge free image usage allowance.

00:02:13.295 --> 00:02:15.070
There is also a paid version too,

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.350
but the free account includes storing thousands of images.

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.960
You shouldn't have any worries unless your project grows to a huge level.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.165
I already have an account since I use this quite regularly.

00:02:26.165 --> 00:02:28.415
I'm going to open up this new tab.

00:02:28.415 --> 00:02:32.870
Then taking it to the user dashboard area for this lesson,

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.400
head over to number 7,

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.035
which is using a CDN.

00:02:36.035 --> 00:02:40.555
I already have this open and also opened up inside a new browser tab.

00:02:40.555 --> 00:02:43.035
This is just empty HTML file.

00:02:43.035 --> 00:02:44.480
Inside the images folder,

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.670
we just have this one single image,

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:52.735
which is 5,311 pixels by three-five, four-five wide.

00:02:52.735 --> 00:02:54.830
Meaning this is a pretty big image,

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:58.580
but this time we're not going to be linking it directly to this image.

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.355
Instead, we can upload this image to Cloudinary

00:03:01.355 --> 00:03:04.700
and then at the Cloudinary link inside our index.

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.580
For this, let's go into our project folder,

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.765
into at number 7 and in the images folder,

00:03:12.765 --> 00:03:14.600
and over to the Cloudinary dashboard,

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.625
which you'll be taken to when logged in.

00:03:16.625 --> 00:03:19.490
All we need to do is to click on the media library.

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:23.485
Then we can drag and drop a new image which you want to upload.

00:03:23.485 --> 00:03:26.145
Drop this inside here,

00:03:26.145 --> 00:03:29.770
and just give this a few seconds to upload.

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.910
There we go. There's our new image.

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.370
If we hover over this,

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.660
we can see a URL which we can copy with this link just here.

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.550
If we double-click on this image,

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:49.955
we're taken into the detail where we can add things such as tags.

00:03:49.955 --> 00:03:51.710
We can add some metadata.

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:53.810
We can see any revision history.

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.390
We can see the file data such as the file type,

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:58.870
the size, and also the dimensions.

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.495
Then down at the bottom we have what is called transformations.

00:04:02.495 --> 00:04:07.415
Currently we are on the original and this is the URL to this particular image.

00:04:07.415 --> 00:04:12.290
Cloudinary has automatically added some transformations to improve our image,

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:13.685
to change the size,

00:04:13.685 --> 00:04:15.320
to transform into a thumbnail.

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:16.565
We can have a banner,

00:04:16.565 --> 00:04:18.665
we can have a watermarked version.

00:04:18.665 --> 00:04:21.020
Each time I click on one of these images,

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:25.010
we have a new URL which we can use inside of our projects.

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:27.350
Along with these defaults, we can also create

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.825
our own transformations too by clicking on this transform button.

00:04:31.825 --> 00:04:35.465
From here, we can crop and resize our images.

00:04:35.465 --> 00:04:37.490
We can change the image format,

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.460
we have an option for all of these different extensions.

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.475
We can adjust the quality with this drop down and this slider.

00:04:44.475 --> 00:04:46.040
We can add corner radiuses,

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.940
we can rotate, we can add lots of different effects.

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.755
Every time we make a change to this image,

00:04:51.755 --> 00:04:56.945
we're then given a new URL which we can copy and use inside of our project.

00:04:56.945 --> 00:04:59.780
Each time we make a change to our images,

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:03.350
let me just close it down and go back into the original.

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:06.830
Each time we make a change to one of our images such as clicking

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:10.530
on one of these presets or even our own transforms,

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.885
we are then given a new URL which has some different parameters.

00:05:14.885 --> 00:05:19.165
Here we can see this orange parameters are being added and separated by comma.

00:05:19.165 --> 00:05:20.510
If we click on the circle.

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:25.310
We can see different ones here and these will affect things such as the size,

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:28.355
the radius, the border, the color.

00:05:28.355 --> 00:05:32.315
This is our way of telling Cloudinary which image we want to fetch.

00:05:32.315 --> 00:05:34.775
This image ID is always the same at the end,

00:05:34.775 --> 00:05:38.825
but we'll just add these different parameters inside of the URL.

00:05:38.825 --> 00:05:42.020
Let's go over to our project and we can try this out.

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:47.345
First of all, if we click on the original and then we can select this URL.

00:05:47.345 --> 00:05:52.165
We'll just copy what's in it just here into our projects.

00:05:52.165 --> 00:05:55.070
What we're first going to do is to set the image to be

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:59.105
100 percent of the browsers width with the style tags.

00:05:59.105 --> 00:06:04.905
The image elements, max width of 100 percent.

00:06:04.905 --> 00:06:11.060
Then down into the body section we can create an image with this URL as well.

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:13.850
Deregulate made which was the link which we just copied.

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:18.035
All we need to do is to paste in the source attributes,

00:06:18.035 --> 00:06:20.480
close down the sidebar,

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:25.245
give this a save, refresh the browser.

00:06:25.245 --> 00:06:27.560
We can see since this is quite a big image,

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:29.270
it's taken some time to download.

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:32.585
This image is far too big for the current browser size,

00:06:32.585 --> 00:06:35.690
but we'll look at how to adjust this in just a moment.

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:40.230
Next, we can adjust the rotation or the angle of this image.

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:43.790
We do this just after this upload section.

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:45.730
If we say forward slash,

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:51.030
say alpha angle underscore and then 90 for a 90 degrees.

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:53.450
All of this comes before the image ID,

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:58.595
which is at the very end and also the image name. Save this.

00:06:58.595 --> 00:07:04.420
Reload and now we should pull in a 90 degree version of our existing image.

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:06.810
Of course, this is far too big,

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:10.520
lets remove the angle and we can set a fixed size in

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:16.510
pixels with w then underscore followed by the pixel values such as 200.

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:19.970
Refresh. Now this pulls an image which is

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:23.720
really small and we can see the download time is much faster,

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:26.180
but as we've learned in previous videos,

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:29.440
a pixel size is not always the best choice.

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:33.200
What we're going to do is to set the width to be equal to, also,

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:38.910
which is going to allow Cloudinary to choose the best size image for the browser.

00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:44.000
Here we see it chose a 3.4 megabyte version.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.875
If we go to the original.

00:07:45.875 --> 00:07:47.840
The original is about 4.2,

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:52.165
so it chose a smaller size which is suitable for this browser.

00:07:52.165 --> 00:07:57.905
We can also change the default format of this image by using f then underscore,

00:07:57.905 --> 00:08:00.950
and then selecting one of the allowed format by Cloudinary.

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:04.710
I'm going to go for WebP and also for this,

00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:11.020
we can remove the.jpeg extension of the browser and refresh.

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:14.810
We now see the image type is WebP.

00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:17.825
Just like with the size, we can also allow Cloudinary to

00:08:17.825 --> 00:08:20.735
automatically set the correct format photos.

00:08:20.735 --> 00:08:24.705
We could do this with f auto, and if we do this,

00:08:24.705 --> 00:08:28.210
we see that Cloudinary also chooses a WebP format photos,

00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:31.450
since this is supported inside of the Chrome browser.

00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:35.200
There's also many other options which we can add inside here.

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:37.370
We can also combine them too,

00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:39.410
or we could also generate these URLs

00:08:39.410 --> 00:08:43.390
ourselves inside of Cloudinary using these transforms.

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:47.160
This is just an overview of a basic usage with Cloudinary.

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:51.410
But it has many more features including adding presets which automatically

00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:56.195
configure or transform our images each time we upload new ones.

00:08:56.195 --> 00:08:59.525
There is a developer API to connect your projects.

00:08:59.525 --> 00:09:03.695
This will allow you to automatically do things like adding news uploads.

00:09:03.695 --> 00:09:05.330
You can include video.

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:08.395
I would recommend looking through some of these features.

00:09:08.395 --> 00:09:13.035
Also the documentation too if you plan to use Cloudinary for a project.

00:09:13.035 --> 00:09:16.280
I also use Cloudinary for my own projects too,

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:18.145
and find it very reliable.

00:09:18.145 --> 00:09:22.355
Also even though this example just uses the basic image elements,

00:09:22.355 --> 00:09:25.000
we can also combine these hosted images with

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.850
[inaudible] and also the pitcher element too.

00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:30.080
In the upcoming video,

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:35.880
we'll discover another way to reduce our page load time by setting up lazy loading.
