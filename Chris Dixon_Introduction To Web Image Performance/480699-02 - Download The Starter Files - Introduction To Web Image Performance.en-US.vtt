00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:05.640
Before we jump into our first lesson,

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.730
provided with this course is some Starter Files which you

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.300
can download and work through as we progress through this course.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.465
Each one of the lessons has a corresponding folder,

00:00:15.465 --> 00:00:19.410
and inside we have some basic Starter Files, for example,

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.885
this one has a basic HTML page,

00:00:21.885 --> 00:00:26.850
and also some images so we can jump straight in to learning about our topics.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:28.650
To download this for the course,

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.935
what you'll need to do is to head over to github.com,

00:00:31.935 --> 00:00:35.070
and then into my profile which is chrisdixon161.

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.465
Then the repository is the picture element starter files.

00:00:39.465 --> 00:00:42.210
Once you're inside of the repository,

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.705
all you need to do is to click on this "Code" button and then download this zip file.

00:00:47.705 --> 00:00:51.095
For easy access, I've placed mine on the desktop just here,

00:00:51.095 --> 00:00:53.650
but you can place it anywhere which you prefer.

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.450
To work through this course, I'll be using the text editor,

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.700
which is Visual Studio Code.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:03.940
If you don't have one, you can download this through your operating system just here.

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.370
It's free to download,

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:09.670
and free to use for Mac, Windows and Linux.

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.140
Once you have this all setup and installed,

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.275
all you need to do is to drag over the Starter Files into Visual Studio Code.

00:01:18.275 --> 00:01:20.210
I will see you in the next video,

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.580
where we're going to get to work on our first lesson.
