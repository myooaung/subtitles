00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:02.730
Hello and welcome back to the course on statistics.

2
00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:04.930
Today we're talking about skewness.

3
00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:05.510
All right.

4
00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:10.690
So here we've got a normal distribution and looks lovely looks very symmetrical.

5
00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:15.190
But the thing is that not all distributions are that nice.

6
00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:17.180
Not all distributions are that symmetrical.

7
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.050
Sometimes you might get distributions which look like this.

8
00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:25.500
And here we've got two distributions which are skewed in opposite directions.

9
00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:30.880
You've probably heard of skewed as before and if you have an here's a blitz quiz which one of you of

10
00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:36.020
these distributions you think is left skewed and which one of them do you think is right skewed.

11
00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:43.330
All right so we have your answer and the correct answer is the one where here is a left skewed or negatively

12
00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:48.760
skewed the one with the longer tail on the left and the one where here is a right skewed or positively

13
00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.720
skewed with the longer tell in the right.

14
00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:52.850
And a lot of people get this wrong.

15
00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:58.630
A lot of the time because they look at where the hump is and they think OK so the hump is on the right.

16
00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.000
So this is a right skewed distribution.

17
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.840
So it looks like has been dragged towards the right and therefore has rights.

18
00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:10.430
And this one looks like has been dragged towards the left and that is an incorrect way of thinking or

19
00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.580
Moreover leads to incorrect language and sometimes even incorrect insights.

20
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.940
The reason why this is called the left skewed distribution is because the tail is on the left you need

21
00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:27.430
to look at where the tail is and the underlying reason behind that is what we spoke about previously

22
00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.050
that you need to in terms of distributions.

23
00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.000
They're not attached to the chart.

24
00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.560
You don't have to have a char to have a distribution.

25
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.940
A distribution is attached to the data itself.

26
00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:42.500
So you have some underlying data that is driving this chart that is feeding into this chart.

27
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:49.000
Well distribution is a description of that data or is there is something that is associated is a function

28
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.310
that's associated with that data itself.

29
00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.620
And when you think about how does this chart come to be.

30
00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.250
Well why is there a longer left tell.

31
00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:02.430
That's because everything over here is fine is as it should be it's pretty much symmetrical.

32
00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.840
But then you have a lot of outliers on the left.

33
00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:11.770
For example you might have a lot of people with very low I don't know whatever that whatever we're measuring

34
00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.060
on this was going to be easier.

35
00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:19.840
So for instance here you have if this is balancing a bank account you have people with probably not

36
00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.250
the best distribution of all balance and Buy.com because you have a lot of people with lower balances.

37
00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.520
But hypothetically or let's say this is a distribution of income.

38
00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.960
How much people are earning their way and their salaries.

39
00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.100
So you have people who are earning low salaries and you have people who are earning average salary.

40
00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.570
You have people earning high salaries but then you have a lot of outliers who are earning very high

41
00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:38.220
salaries.

42
00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:44.770
If we're measuring salaries in one a company like the c o The executives and so on they might be earning

43
00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:49.940
a lot lot higher salaries than everybody else and therefore the distribution looks like this.

44
00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.700
So when you think of the underlying data things here are OK they're fine.

45
00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.150
What is different is what is happening on the tail side.

46
00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.430
So there are a lot of outliers in your data on the tail and that's where the skewness the term comes

47
00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.070
from that your data is skewed to the right meaning that there's outliers on the right.

48
00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.900
And in this case your data is skewed to the left.

49
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:18.580
There's outliers on the left and then it's this term is just simply also assigned to the chart itself

50
00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:23.110
so you still talk about distributions skewness but by looking at the chart rather than by looking at

51
00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.800
the underlying data.

52
00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.240
But the term itself doesn't change.

53
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.700
So if you think of it in that way you'll never be confused if you think of.

54
00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.040
Okay so what's the underlying data doing in here.

55
00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:35.620
We have extra outliers on the left here we have outliers on the right so this one is left skewed or

56
00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.970
negatively skewed this one is positive right skewed positively skewed.

57
00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.180
So there we go that's a quick note on skewness and where it comes from.

58
00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:47.560
It's all about the underlying data and hopefully this quick tip will help you always be on top of your

59
00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:53.410
feet when you are for instance presenting to executives and when or when you're listening to presentations

60
00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:56.920
and when you're just simply speaking the statistics language.

61
00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.900
And I look forward to seeing you next time.

62
00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.580
Until then happy analyzing.
