00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,590
Hello welcome back to a course on statistics.

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:04,400
Today we got a very interesting topic.

3
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:10,110
The one teld and to tell tests and I got to say that this is the topic that I personally struggle with

4
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:11,070
quite a lot.

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:16,830
Just the way the intuition behind it the thinking about it and what I want to convey in this tutorial

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:22,380
is my take on it like I'm not an expert in statistics and not the world expert on OneTel and to tell

7
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:29,550
tests but I have done thorough research into this to help me better understand what's going on and so

8
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:35,070
I'm going to share you my understanding of the intuition behind these things and why they're different

9
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:36,790
and how this all works.

10
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:42,060
And then I'll direct you at a very interesting article I found about OneTel.

11
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:48,090
And to tell tests and you can read more there and that will help you form your own vision if if you

12
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:50,590
think that it might be a bit different to mine.

13
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:55,260
So let's have a look here we've got a one tailed test.

14
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:58,270
So this is the hypothesis testing that we've been doing all along.

15
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:03,660
And even though that we haven't been explicitly specifying that it's a one tell us that's essentially

16
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:08,790
what we've been doing we've been stating an all hypothesis which was usually something along the lines

17
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:17,060
of the number of households with I-pads used to be this has it increased or has decreased.

18
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,440
And so in that case in those cases the hypothesis would be no it has not increased.

19
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,970
So what's what we're seeing here.

20
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:25,410
No the null hypothesis.

21
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:31,860
No the number of people or households with I-pads has not increased so much less or less than or equal

22
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:32,420
to.

23
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:38,440
I don't know let's say 80 percent whatever it was and the alternative hypothesis.

24
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,740
Yes it has increased.

25
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:44,930
And then we would just see where our sample falls in the sampling distribution.

26
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,980
And if it falls in the rejection region we reject that hypothesis.

27
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:53,340
Same thing on the left would do the same if there was a left tell us if we're looking at the kind of

28
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,910
the opposite sort of it was increasing.

29
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:04,410
Now what to tell test is is when you want to check if the number of people or number of households with

30
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:07,230
I-pads hasn't necessarily increase or decrease.

31
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:08,980
You want to just check if it's changed.

32
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:15,540
You want to see if over time or whatever other effects or other marketing was happening if if something

33
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:19,800
had an effect that changed the underlying parameter in the population.

34
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,000
So you want to in this case you want to see.

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,270
All right so the number of people with a number of households with iPads it was 80 percent.

36
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:28,520
Now we want to see if it's changed.

37
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,770
It could be greater or it could be less.

38
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,890
And that's a two tailed test.

39
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:37,640
And so the essential thing and this is what I was always struggling with.

40
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:44,340
The essential thing to think is that oh well if I can prove that the number of households with iPads

41
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,140
has increased then obviously it has changed.

42
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:56,340
So it should be easier for me to run a two tailed test than a OneTel test because ultimately I have

43
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,050
two options.

44
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:03,210
I can I can just prove that it's increased or I can prove that it's decreased and therefore it's just

45
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:09,300
going to be easier for me is going to be twice as easy for me to prove the to tell test or reject the

46
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:12,540
null hypothesis and into shelters than in a OneTel test.

47
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:16,860
However as it turns out that's not the case in statistics.

48
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,500
It's actually harder to prove.

49
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:19,360
Hate to tell.

50
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:22,900
So what you do in a tootle test is actually you take doses.

51
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:28,470
Statistical significance of 5 percent and you have to split it between the two tells so you only get

52
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:31,550
two and a hops and here and you only get to the house and here.

53
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:41,130
And so it turns out that now when you do your calculations and you pick your sample from the population

54
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:45,970
and then you find out where that means the sample falls it might fall here or here.

55
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:51,630
Now it's much harder for you to reject the null hypothesis because the mineral might fall right over

56
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:55,040
here right next so it might fall and the 4 percent band.

57
00:03:55,070 --> 00:04:00,300
And in the OneTel test you would have rejected the null hypothesis but to tell test you don't get to

58
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:07,050
reject the hypoth hypothesis because you need to the meaningful and to an Hoppus and that as the main

59
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:09,720
question of today's internals Why does it work like.

60
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:17,720
Why is it so counter-intuitive that a to tail test is actually stricter than a one tail test.

61
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:25,050
So let's have a look here Richard try understand this based on a on a real example like something odd

62
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:29,570
could happen in the real world and that should hopefully clear things up.

63
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:36,480
Let's say we are producing a drug that helps people increase their attention span.

64
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:42,520
So let's say on average in world population the attention span is about 40 minutes.

65
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:46,150
And I'm not sure of probably these numbers are incorrect because I'm just making them up.

66
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:55,140
But let's just say for argument's sake that on average a person has an attention span of about 40 minutes

67
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,360
with a standard deviation in our population of about 20 minutes.

68
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:03,040
So that's that's our Those are the parameters of our population.

69
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:09,120
And so when we plot these sampling distributions they will have a 40 minute mean and that there's some

70
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:15,360
deviation won't be 20 minutes of course because that's the it'll depend on the sample size.

71
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,000
So let's say we pick.

72
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:21,500
We want to test does this drug increase.

73
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:28,230
We specifically designed this drug to increase the attention span of people and we want to test if it's

74
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:34,590
working if it's we want to see if it's increasing the attention span of people so we have a sample of

75
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:42,310
say 100 people and we want to see if the drug has increased.

76
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,590
There is increasing attention span.

77
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:51,380
And so in our case and we got in that sample we got a mean of 45 minutes for the attention span.

78
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:58,440
So in our case the sampling distribution will have a mean of 40 minutes just as the population standard

79
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:04,260
deviation will be 20 divided by square root of 100 so 20 divided by 10 is to the standard deviation

80
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:04,880
here.

81
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:12,090
And we know that's the value that we've measured in our sample is 45 so it falls somewhere here on the

82
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:12,680
right.

83
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:16,770
So the question is can we reject the null hypothesis.

84
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,020
The null hypothesis is that no in the OneTel test no.

85
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:27,750
And so the mean of the population assuming that the drug has no effect would be like if all the people

86
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:33,180
in the world would take this drug and it will have no effect then their population would still stay

87
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,440
as it is it would still stay at 40.

88
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:41,720
So but in our case once it has we say it's less than or equal to 40 and the standard deviation.

89
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,510
And that's it.

90
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:45,400
And the alternative hypothesis is that no it's increased.

91
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,920
And so in that case we just need to prove that.

92
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:49,370
OK.

93
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:52,040
We just need to check if it falls into this rejection area.

94
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:59,910
But the question there is what's to say that our drug actually have a beneficial effect on attention

95
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:00,380
span.

96
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:02,850
What if our drug actually does the opposite.

97
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:06,180
What if our drug decreases the attention span.

98
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:11,520
There is no law of physics that would suggest that that is not possible.

99
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:20,310
There is no 100 percent proof that this drug cannot actually reduce attention span.

100
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:23,320
And that's what a to tell test actually.

101
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:31,350
So checks for actual implies that in cases when you cannot state with and this is again how I understand

102
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:38,400
it in cases where you can state with absolute confidence that the effect has to be on one side of the

103
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:44,580
spectrum you need to test for it to tell a test because what could have happened is actually your drug

104
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:50,460
is not just increasing but it's also it could also be decreasing the attention span.

105
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:54,280
And so that's what you need to be checking for in a.

106
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:58,350
In that case and so only situations where it can.

107
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:05,220
Again in my opinion only situations where you should do a OneTel test is where you can justify that

108
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:12,740
the why it has to be a OneTel test that it's not an option for the effect to be in either direction.

109
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:18,710
And that's that's when you do a OneTel test in Inuk in the case when you're not sure about that.

110
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:25,620
It's just safer to go over to tell test and hopefully that makes it a bit clearer or why a to tell test

111
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,900
is harder to prove than a OneTel test.

112
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:30,510
And that's because no one will test you.

113
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:35,180
You're kind of assuming that you have prior knowledge you kind of assuming that you're ready.

114
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:41,460
This is not even possible that this is not even an option that you just want to check that this is happening

115
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,750
and to tell test your.

116
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:49,830
And you don't have the knowledge or you're not allowing yourself to kind of make that assumption and

117
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:55,470
therefore you have to deal with both sides of the tale.

118
00:08:55,470 --> 00:09:01,830
So again this is a very it's a bit of a counterintuitive topic but at the same time it is a very gray

119
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:04,790
area that as you can see it's easier to prove a OneTel test.

120
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:13,170
And so researchers can be prone to actually doing OneTel tests just to get that P-value and to get their

121
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:15,610
research published and to get the research correct.

122
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:19,910
I'm not saying that all researchers do this but it can be a problem.

123
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:26,250
It can be a temptation to do that but it's also always important to look at what's going on what's actually

124
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:27,330
going on.

125
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:33,930
What do you need to be testing and what kind of preexisting knowledge and assumptions can you have and

126
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:34,690
can you make.

127
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:39,820
And we'll see an example of this in the next tutorial when we're looking at an actual analytics challenge.

128
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:46,440
But for now if you'd like to read more on this topic we'd like to direct you to this blog it's called

129
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,330
OneTel versus to tell tests.

130
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,600
Does it matter.

131
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:51,360
Is by Alex or cat.

132
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,520
Here's the link.

133
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:59,470
You will notice that it is for advertising for like ads on digital ads and stuff like that.

134
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:06,160
But at the same time all of those hold the same concepts can apply for it can apply to any type of problem

135
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:13,000
is just an interesting read in a while like it is because Alex actually interviewed quite a lot of specialists

136
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,420
in the area and got their opinions and there's a lot of opinions there.

137
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:21,490
So in this tutorial you just got my opinion and have a look there and you'll find out find when many

138
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:22,480
more opinions and help.

139
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:28,070
Hopefully that will help you develop your own understanding of what tell'd and to tell us.

140
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:33,640
And definitely we'll practice this in the next tutorial so that will help you even further solidify

141
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:37,630
that knowledge and I hope you enjoyed this tutorial and look for the next step.

142
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:39,100
Until then happy analyzing.
