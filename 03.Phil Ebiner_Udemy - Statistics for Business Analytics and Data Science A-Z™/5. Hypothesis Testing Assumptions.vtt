00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.020
Hello and welcome back to the course on statistics.

2
00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:08.380
Today we're going to take a quick break from a running mathematical calculations and we're going to

3
00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:09.790
talk about assumptions.

4
00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:15.660
Now we specifically chose not to start this section with assumptions so that we wouldn't get overwhelmed

5
00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:21.250
Starfall like too much theory because we already talked about statistical significance and there was

6
00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:27.580
kind of enough for us to get into the world of hypothesis testing and Rano first hypothesis test as

7
00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.490
you can see we successfully came up with a result.

8
00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:35.740
Well assumptions are still very important and it's a good idea to talk about them now so that we are

9
00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:40.350
more in tune with what's going on when we're proceeding further with this course.

10
00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:42.060
So let's have a look.

11
00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:48.340
All right assumptions of this test because what we've been doing so far hypothesis testing is actually

12
00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:53.740
called Zed test or that test we're running does that test because we look at the table and we're calculating

13
00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:54.820
that score.

14
00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:59.820
So the first assumption of that test is that the sample is selected at random.

15
00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:04.280
Very important assumption which often is not taken in the correct manner.

16
00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:11.410
And this is going to give you like a small overview of what I've seen in my experience and how you can

17
00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:12.730
avoid making that mistake.

18
00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:18.730
I think I think it's important to be aware of the possible pitfalls that exist with selecting random

19
00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:19.660
samples.

20
00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.910
It sounds like a very easy thing to do to select a random sample.

21
00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:29.320
Let's say let's look at an example let's say you're a government and you want to find out what percentage

22
00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:36.160
of your population walks to work what percentage of the population rise bicycle rides and then how many

23
00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.530
what percentage uses public transport what percentage takes drives a car to work.

24
00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:47.020
And so what you do is you get a list of people who live in your country which you might have through

25
00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.410
a census or something like that.

26
00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:54.070
And then you for instance you put into Excel you add a new column and you put a random variable like

27
00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:59.740
a 1 or a 0 and you select 1000 people at random so that is a great first step.

28
00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:05.460
You have ensured that the way you selected these people are random because you applied a random algorithm

29
00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:06.460
that's great.

30
00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:07.990
And a lot of people leave it at that.

31
00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.690
OK.

32
00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.920
So let's say say that we are OK with select a random sample.

33
00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.390
Ok here's a sample.

34
00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:18.460
Here the people that look up the phonebook these are the numbers and then they outsource to an agency

35
00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:25.600
to go and call up these thousand or 2000 people to get their insights into how they travel to work and

36
00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.730
they think at this stage that that's it.

37
00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.060
The assumption has been fulfilled that that's not the case.

38
00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:36.360
The thing is that you need to make sure this assumption holds throughout your whole testing process.

39
00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:42.070
And I'll give you like will extend that example to see how what pitfall the in this case the government

40
00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.630
could have really easily fallen into.

41
00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.520
And as I mentioned I've seen this happen before.

42
00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:53.710
So what do you normally see in a phone book or in that database that you have phone numbers off.

43
00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.940
You normally see people's landlines their home phone landlines.

44
00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.650
How many people do you know who use a landline who still have a landline.

45
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:04.180
I'm not sure.

46
00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.410
I think in the U.S. is probably even more extreme.

47
00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:14.020
But in Australia it's like I know maybe one maybe two people out of all the people I know who who even

48
00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:15.100
have a landline.

49
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:22.750
So what do you think the result is going to be when this agency and the agency usually doesn't really

50
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:28.180
just do just the job that they've been told to do that they've been subscribed to do they don't actually

51
00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:33.030
assess the validity of the results and things like that they just go and call people and do what.

52
00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.860
And you know check the boxes and that's it.

53
00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.310
So what do you think is going to happen.

54
00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:43.060
Probably a lot of the people that they call will probably not first of all not pick up and that is usually

55
00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.390
taken into account the government might provide a larger sample.

56
00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:51.070
Taking into account that probably 50 percent of the people won't pick up or 70 percent of people won't

57
00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.570
pick up.

58
00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:57.460
But nevertheless most people are they're going to call through this to on their landlines are people

59
00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:03.670
who have landlines are people who still use landline phones and those are other like I don't know maybe

60
00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:09.400
somebody who works from home who has a business who has to have legally a landline or most likely is

61
00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.380
just it's an older demographic.

62
00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:15.530
People who still have landlines because they're used to them for sure.

63
00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:23.140
This approach is going to capture a very tiny amount of millennials a very small amount of like people

64
00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:28.300
between what are millennials like 25 to 35 or something and people in a very small amount of people

65
00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:33.690
35 to 45 like generation what is that Generation Y.

66
00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:40.050
I think so they're going to capture very few people of the more younger population.

67
00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:48.220
So the analysis the sample is going to be skewed towards older demographics and at the same time the

68
00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.660
people who picked out the sample will still be thinking oh we've selected a random sample.

69
00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:59.590
Well that's not the case because you did select a random sample but through the process of your testing

70
00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:04.070
the way you approach the problem the sample is no longer random and the insights that they're going

71
00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:12.200
to get back is let's say they find out that 70 percent of people drive to work while those insights

72
00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:17.840
are about not about the whole of the population the sale of Australia in this case.

73
00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:24.380
But they are insight into just the people that this sample represents so the older demographic maybe

74
00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:31.670
70 percent of people over the age of 55 drive to work or wherever they're going to their hobbies if

75
00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:32.580
they're retired.

76
00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:39.320
So that is a very important thing to understand that through the process just the way you conduct analysis

77
00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:45.470
you might actually skew your sample and even though you have selected at random it is no longer a random

78
00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:46.110
sample.

79
00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:48.840
It is a biased sample.

80
00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:52.740
So there you go that's about selecting random sample so be careful of that.

81
00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:59.480
Always follow through towards the end and make sure that the sample that nothing happens that makes

82
00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.570
the sample become nonrandom.

83
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:07.780
And a quick question like Blits question what do you think if you called people's mobiles.

84
00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:10.050
Would that be a random sample.

85
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:11.920
So that's another tricky question.

86
00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:14.730
It's already much better than calling landlines.

87
00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:20.420
But oftentimes even that's not it depends on the problem but often don't even that's not a random sample

88
00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:26.690
because when you get the answers think about it when you get the answers your sample represents people

89
00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:29.810
who answer questions when called on mobile phones.

90
00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:37.490
So and that's probably not exactly identical to all of the people there might be a bias that for example

91
00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:42.650
more introverted people will not answer a question even if they're told this is the government or this

92
00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:43.940
is a poll or a survey.

93
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.590
They might just not ask answer a question on the phone or they're less likely and so therefore even

94
00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:52.600
when you call people on the phone like that or busy people for example.

95
00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:56.250
Businessmen don't want to have time to answer that question.

96
00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:00.270
And so if you call people on their mobile phones or they might not even pick up.

97
00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:06.540
So your sample is biased towards people who pick up their phone and who do answer questions.

98
00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:08.700
Maybe that's no big deal for journalists.

99
00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:14.000
Maybe the fact that your sample is biased towards extroverted people rather than introverted people

100
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:14.840
doesn't affect you.

101
00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:18.800
And also because the variable that you're exploring you know whether they walk to work or they drive

102
00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:19.550
to work.

103
00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:22.380
It doesn't depend on whether a person's Internet or an extra.

104
00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:23.060
That's fine.

105
00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:28.880
In that case you can consider this a random sample but if it does depend on that for instance if you're

106
00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:35.500
biased towards non businessmen for people who do pick up their phone maybe in that case it's going to

107
00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:40.400
it does somehow affect the people that you're excluding could somehow affect in a different way the

108
00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:44.120
variable that you're exploring and therefore your samples are no longer random.

109
00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:49.190
So even in that case you have to be very very careful how you select your samples so you have to think

110
00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:51.920
these through and just increasing the sample size.

111
00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:56.240
That's a funny thing here that just increasing the sample size doesn't solve these problems.

112
00:07:56.380 --> 00:08:01.550
If introverted people are not picking up at a thousand person sample they're not going to be picking

113
00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:04.060
up a 10000 person sample not a Internet.

114
00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:08.870
People don't pick up but they're less likely to interact with somebody who's calling them up and asking

115
00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:10.860
them about their opinion on something.

116
00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:15.790
So hopefully that makes sense and that's why you have to really think through how you'd like to sample.

117
00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:22.280
Well that's easy part but how you actually go about ensuring what process you undertake to get the information

118
00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:23.420
that you're after.

119
00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:27.950
Much easier when you don't have to when you're dealing with business processes and things like that

120
00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:32.720
when it's not people that you're dealing with in those cases you have a bit more control and just go

121
00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:35.210
into the business and you get the insights that you need.

122
00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:40.010
Maybe you're like serving parts that are coming out of your manufacturing plant and you want to see

123
00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:42.730
how many of them are have defects or even don't.

124
00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:45.950
And so in that case it's much easier because you just it's unbiased.

125
00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:50.600
You go and you just look at the bit harder when you're dealing with things that are out of your control.

126
00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:57.500
OK so that was a long note on samples but hopefully they'll help you avoid some of these very dangerous

127
00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:01.070
pitfalls that exist in hypothesis testing.

128
00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:03.200
Observations are independent.

129
00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:05.930
This one is another very intuitive one.

130
00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:07.950
It just you just have to be careful about that.

131
00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:14.500
For instance in terms of surveys and stuff like that if you go out and like it doesn't have to be a

132
00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:19.790
or it could be you're serving your customers like a lot of business a B2C and you might be working a

133
00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:25.280
b c business and you might be end up working with data like this for instance if you surveyed your customers

134
00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:31.490
and you wanted to find out whether they like your mobile phones that you're producing or not.

135
00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:37.040
So what would happen is in how how could this be non-independent or let's say you're doing a live there's

136
00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:41.710
like a crowd of people you just you just walking up to them in the street and you're like asking them

137
00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:47.840
well when they wouldn't be independent if you ask like a person and then you ask another person and

138
00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:50.530
another person and the next person hears all of this.

139
00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:55.040
So one person says Yes I love your mobile phone the next person says Yes I love your mobile phones the

140
00:09:55.040 --> 00:10:00.670
next person says Yes I love you more phones and then the fourth person he is shared his he feels his

141
00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:05.290
peer pressure to say that he does love the mobile phones even though his opinion might be different

142
00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:10.000
he might not love them as much or he might hate them or whatever but just because everybody else around

143
00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.160
him said that and it's a known fact this is a this is just the way the human brain works that we're

144
00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:21.310
social creatures and we we are susceptible to we might be some might call it pill peer pressure but

145
00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:26.470
it is a psychological phenomenon when a lot of people around you do one thing or say one thing you are

146
00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:28.420
more likely to say that same thing.

147
00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:32.830
And so when that fourth person when you get to the fourth person their opinion has They're not going

148
00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:37.870
to voice their their true opinion they're going to voice a biased opinion or the opinion that they've

149
00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:42.370
just copied off other people or an altered version of their opinion and therefore you're not going to

150
00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:43.690
get the true result.

151
00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:48.540
And even though you might it might have been like a random sample and everything else is great.

152
00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:53.770
But in this case your observations are not independent and you might get a a an incorrect result.

153
00:10:53.770 --> 00:10:56.090
So very important to be careful about that.

154
00:10:56.260 --> 00:11:02.440
So hopefully an example that makes this a bit clearer what we're looking out for when we're making sure

155
00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:04.270
that our observations are independent.

156
00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:11.140
And the third assumption is that the population standard deviation is known or the sample contains at

157
00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:12.620
least 30 observation.

158
00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:16.600
So we're going to talk about this more and the further trials but I'll just give you a quick heads up

159
00:11:16.930 --> 00:11:22.510
that this first condition the population standard deviation is known as you saw we were.

160
00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:28.210
Every time we were running on time we did run a hypothesis test proves the we knew the standard deviation

161
00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:32.460
and we used that to calculate the standard the sampling distribution.

162
00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:37.180
If we don't know the standard deviation of the population that's also fine.

163
00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:40.670
But in that case we need to run a T-test.

164
00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:42.490
It's called a students.

165
00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:47.680
It's based rather than being based on the normal distributions based on the student's t distribution

166
00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:48.490
and we'll talk about it.

167
00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:49.950
It's not complex at all.

168
00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:51.250
You'll see it's very simple.

169
00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:52.950
It's another very simple concept.

170
00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:59.050
We'll talk about it further down in this course but in this case you run a t test instead of a test.

171
00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:05.110
And the thing about the study sample size here is that in the case when you have 30 observations or

172
00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:09.820
more or the t distribution is actually very close to a normal distribution.

173
00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:13.630
So in this case it doesn't even matter if you if you have three observations or more it doesn't matter

174
00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:16.810
if you run a t test or As'ad test it won't matter.

175
00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:19.980
It only matters when you have less than 30 observations in a sample.

176
00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:24.120
So we'll talk more on that later for sure when we get to the T-test.

177
00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:26.340
But for now those are the assumptions of the Zad test.

178
00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:31.750
So a sample is like the random observations are independent and the population division is is known

179
00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:38.010
or the sample contains 30 observations or more as you can see there very simple very intuitive assumptions.

180
00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:44.530
But at the same time it can be tricky if you don't look out for them properly throughout your whole

181
00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:45.670
experiment.

182
00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:46.510
So there we go.

183
00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:49.250
Hope you enjoyed the senatorial and I'll see you next time.

184
00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:50.860
Until then have analyzing.
