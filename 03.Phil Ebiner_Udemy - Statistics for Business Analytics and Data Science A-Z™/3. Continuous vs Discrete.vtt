00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:05.180
Hello and welcome back to the course on statistics so continuous versus discrete.

2
00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:07.100
Let's get started.

3
00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:13.060
So here we've got a data set of values so these are customers of an imaginary bank.

4
00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:18.950
They have good customer I.D. they've got Name Surname gender age age group height region obfuscation

5
00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:24.860
tenure and months how long they've been with the bank balance and spend and spend on groceries.

6
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:29.230
So here we're just going to quickly introduce the concept of continuous and discrete.

7
00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.950
It's going to be important for us when we come to talk about distributions generally speaking what is

8
00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.460
the difference between continues and discrete.

9
00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.990
Verelst we're talking about continuous discrete variables or columns and data in a dataset or database.

10
00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:49.970
So continuous our columns that can take any value in between a certain range or even filtering just

11
00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:55.760
can take any value out and your restrictions and your real value or even any fractional value that also

12
00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:01.760
cause it continues because real values contain rational and irrational numbers numbers and therefore

13
00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:03.710
fractions will also Conor's continue.

14
00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.860
So let's have a look in more detail for example discrete.

15
00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.210
Let's talk about region.

16
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.580
So here you've got Scotland Northern Ireland Wales.

17
00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:19.150
These are represented by and England of course polities Scotland Northern Ireland wells and these are

18
00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.100
regions of the U.K. and they're represented by words.

19
00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:28.730
So there the names of the these are separate countries inside the UK so the names of each of these regions.

20
00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:34.970
Well we could change these two numbers or could make it 1 2 3 4 or 0 1 2 3 or something like that to

21
00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:35.530
represent that.

22
00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.690
And that would be a a discrete variable.

23
00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.560
And this is already a discrete variable just represented by words what that means is that they are CRN

24
00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.690
values that it can take.

25
00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.800
It can only take one of four values you cannot take anything between and of course that is the case

26
00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.490
because it's a categorical variable that only has categories.

27
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.130
But let's have a look at something else just to see the differences.

28
00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:56.860
So you start painting the picture.

29
00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.670
Let's look at it take a look at balance.

30
00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.620
So as you can see here balance is there the amount of money that they have on their bank account and

31
00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:09.840
it can take pretty much any value between 0 dollars maybe even negative it can go negative.

32
00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.410
That's like a credit card balance.

33
00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:18.270
And it can go all the way up to whatever Like million 10 million probably not more than a billion although

34
00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.330
maybe there are probably some banks have customers of a billion dollars but not more than 100 billion

35
00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:24.380
dollars.

36
00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:31.130
So there is kind of a limit but at the same time the amount can take any value in between.

37
00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.760
You can see that it's rounded to the second decimal and that's just because that's how currency works.

38
00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.370
We only have sense.

39
00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.280
You can't have less than one cent in essence.

40
00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:47.960
That's just a restriction of the underlying whatever we're dealing with the currency in this case it's

41
00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.830
not an implicit restriction that we're putting on the data set.

42
00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:52.570
We're not saying that.

43
00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.430
OK so we only wanted to be like that.

44
00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:01.460
Basically if it were up to us we would let currency to be anything it's not important to us that is

45
00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:05.780
up to the second decimal we could have twelve point two five five a dollar forty eight or forty eight

46
00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.170
seven six five four three two one.

47
00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.590
It doesn't really matter.

48
00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.130
Basically that's what it means when a variable is continuous that it can take.

49
00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:18.590
Hypothetically could take any values between any on that certain range or you fall in your range.

50
00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:24.080
Even so in this case between age two values you could always get another value whereas with for discreate

51
00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:29.200
there's only a fixed set of values that you have intentionally set that the database can.

52
00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:30.800
Now the data set can be taken.

53
00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:37.700
A good example here is for his age group and age group you still have values 20 30 40 50 and so on.

54
00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.480
So that's the age rounded down to the nearest 10.

55
00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:47.060
So if somebody is 27 then it's run down to 20 and just puts them into an age group into a bucket like

56
00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.690
that.

57
00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:53.330
And even though this is a numeric variable in reality it's a discrete variable because you want it to

58
00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:59.660
be you only want CRN certain bands you only want 10 or 10 years for like somebody who's 18 years old

59
00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:06.470
so you want the 10 year old age group that 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 you want it that way and therefore

60
00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:07.480
it's discreet.

61
00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.920
On the other hand age over here age is an interesting one.

62
00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.670
So do we treat age as continuous or discrete.

63
00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:19.100
A very common question age should be It depends on your intentions.

64
00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:24.860
And just as we saw with balance as we saw of age group spend on groceries that's obviously continues

65
00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:26.330
but what about age.

66
00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.920
So as you can see here it's it's also rounded to the nearest year.

67
00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.630
But is that your intention did you want to be like that.

68
00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.350
Is it important to you that they fall inside these.

69
00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:37.600
They only take these certain values.

70
00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.910
In that case you can treat it as discrete and you should treat as discreet.

71
00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:47.030
On the other hand if age is if it doesn't matter to you just don't mind that you know that it's not

72
00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:51.200
accurate up to that whatever decimal or maybe that's the way your database is structured you just asked

73
00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:55.120
for the year ask for the age in years rather than months and so on.

74
00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.870
But you want to treat as continue as is your intention.

75
00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:02.110
It's not your intention for it to be in separate buckets like it then it is continuous.

76
00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:04.110
It sounds like a gray area is really not.

77
00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:08.520
It's up to your analysis and what you're doing and you'll see further down through this section what

78
00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:13.470
implications they are offering something as Israel continues and you'll be able to decide.

79
00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:18.720
But hopefully that kind of like summarizes it and makes it a bit clearer what the differences.

80
00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:24.120
A great example which we don't have in this dataset because banks don't measure this information apparently.

81
00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:28.630
Great example is shoe size or foot size so foot size in inches.

82
00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:34.890
It could be anything if you think about it it could be from whatever number of inches is the smallest

83
00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:36.900
foot to whatever number of inches the biggest foot.

84
00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:40.340
But then in between there is an unlimited number of values.

85
00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:43.920
So a ruler is 12 inches so let's say I don't know 8 inches.

86
00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:48.180
Somebody's foot could probably be 8 inches but it could be eight point or one it could be eight point

87
00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:49.050
or one.

88
00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:51.840
It could be eight point one two three four seven.

89
00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:57.570
And so basically this unlimited number of numbers in that range.

90
00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.950
And that's the foot size on the shoe size on the other hand.

91
00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:01.800
They're fixed.

92
00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:07.170
It can be sized for the one for one and a half foot two for two and a half or three for in European

93
00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:12.330
size and in Australian sizes would be like eight eight and a half nine and a half tent and a half every

94
00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:12.800
time.

95
00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:14.180
Every time I have to.

96
00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:16.400
It's so hard.

97
00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:21.540
And in America I think they have different yet again and same same with closing type of clothes.

98
00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:27.240
But the point stands that foot size can be different shoe size on the other hand.

99
00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:29.760
There are specific categories that it falls into.

100
00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:33.380
So one is continuous foot size Dahlia's discreet shoe size.

101
00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:39.240
So hopefully that's it clears it up between continuous and discrete and that's all for today.

102
00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:43.950
Just go to Tauriel to reintroduce these concepts concepts refresh on them and we'll present the next

103
00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:45.410
one for you then.

104
00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:47.210
And until next I'm happy analyzing.
