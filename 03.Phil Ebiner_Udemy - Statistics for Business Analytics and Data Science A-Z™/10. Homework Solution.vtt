00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:06.880
Hello and welcome back to the course on statistics today we're solving the challenge for Wall Street.

2
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:07.920
Very interesting.

3
00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:14.460
I hope you found the tutorial very interesting and the homework is so very interesting so let's have

4
00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.300
a look at how we can solve it.

5
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.690
And as before before we proceed Here's a disclaimer I'm not going to read out because I read in the

6
00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:22.880
challenge itself.

7
00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:27.470
But if you haven't seen the disclaimer yet make sure to read through it.

8
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:34.050
Just because we're mentioning some financial markets and so on I just wanted to make sure it's a we're

9
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:43.350
this is all for purposes of education only in the space of analytics and statistics rather than finance

10
00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.790
so just make sure you're aware of the disclaimer.

11
00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.450
And now let's proceed.

12
00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:56.850
So the team I just wanted to quote this phrase from the challenge itself and the main part that was

13
00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:03.840
I wanted to point out his profits have I mean ninety five dollars and seventy cents and a standard deviation

14
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.510
of 1247 dollars.

15
00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.830
How crazy is that.

16
00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:14.840
I just wanted to spend a bit of time like a side note here to illustrate how really crazy that is.

17
00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.350
And also here he does say la distribution.

18
00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.110
But if you saw the hint or even if you didn't see the hint because of what we discussed in the tutorials

19
00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:31.230
we don't really mind what distribution the underlying population has with its Loblaws or anything else.

20
00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.880
We can still just supply the Central Limit Theorem.

21
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.390
It holds it works.

22
00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.610
And this is completely irrelevant so it was there just to scare you off.

23
00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.950
And I hope it didn't scare you off and you were able to solve the challenge so we don't worry about

24
00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.350
the distribution at all what type of distribution it is.

25
00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.150
And so yeah let's plot this let's see how this looks.

26
00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.290
So there's our access that's a zero.

27
00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:59.670
If that's a thousand that's a minus a thousand dollars then that's ninety five dollars and seventy cents

28
00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.080
that's that close to zero.

29
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.360
They're very close.

30
00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.150
And that's just so proximately So that's approximately drawn to scale.

31
00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.490
And the other thing I want to say is that even though this is applauses Russian we know it does matter

32
00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.590
and we're going to be drawing a normal distribution just to see what this would feel like on a normal

33
00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:17.250
distribution.

34
00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:23.040
Just understand what what it means when the verion or when the standard deviation is so high compared

35
00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.810
to the mean.

36
00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.450
So let's have a look.

37
00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:31.820
That's our the normal distribution which we we're accustomed to the image that we've been looking at

38
00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.780
so it looks it looks okay you know nice neat normal distribution.

39
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.680
But the problem here is that you can see like Â£95 only That's the mean.

40
00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.280
There we go.

41
00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.320
That's mean but our Sandri vision is 1247.

42
00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.360
So that means the distance these lines are plus one sound deviation minus one standard that means a

43
00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:57.660
distance between the mean and each one of these lines is 1247 meaning that from here it does no way

44
00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.830
is going to be here is actually going to be somewhere with there and this line is going to be somewhere

45
00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.640
over there or behind this one minus one doesn't this was going to be past this 1000.

46
00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.530
So let's stretch it out let's see what that will look like.

47
00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:11.470
There we go.

48
00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.970
So as you can see that's more realistic has more like it.

49
00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.100
And the problem here is that.

50
00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.610
So what does this mean.

51
00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.410
What does the distribution like that mean.

52
00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.270
Well if you stretch out even more you'll just become like if you stretch it out infinitely you'll just

53
00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:33.330
become flat right or will be just there won't be an ever completely flat but it basically just becomes

54
00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:40.110
more and more flatter and flatter and and the top obviously goes down because you know your area under

55
00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:46.620
the curve has to has to be equal to one because that's probability.

56
00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:54.030
But nevertheless what we're looking at is remember the rule that between these standard deviations you

57
00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:59.400
have 68 approximately 68 percent or 34 percent here 34 percent here.

58
00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:00.210
Wow.

59
00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:06.060
When it looks something like this let's just look at it and in the example of training that we're talking

60
00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:06.780
about now.

61
00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.060
So it looks like this.

62
00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.150
And you have 34 percent falling here 34 percent here so about.

63
00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:17.820
Sixty eight percent of the observations for here may be a little bit more fall here and so on and so

64
00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:25.590
you know kind of where we're to expect them to fall and therefore yes they can fall below zero.

65
00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:30.280
But as you can see out of the 68 percent most of them are above zero.

66
00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:39.140
When you have a scenario like this 68 percent are in here they like pretty much almost this 95 with

67
00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:45.970
70 becomes so close to zero that it's not 4 percent here but maybe out of these 35 percent that are

68
00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.460
here maybe 32 percent are below zero.

69
00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:54.520
So there's a lot of observations that are falling below zero and observations below zero means that

70
00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:56.470
it's a loss.

71
00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:57.070
It's a trade.

72
00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:02.080
The trade brought a loss rather than a profit so profit losses are here and you can see it goes quite

73
00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.780
far down down the good side.

74
00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:06.550
Good thing is that the upside is also pretty high.

75
00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:14.470
So instead of in this case you have you know you can only statistically expect with like a 95 percent

76
00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:19.690
chance that you will like most likely with a 95 percent chance your profit if you do make a profit will

77
00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:23.040
be under whatever the value here is like $150.

78
00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:27.520
But you know there's a 2 percent chance of you getting more than $150 here.

79
00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:30.250
There's a huge chance of getting more than $150.

80
00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:34.340
In fact there's huge chance of getting more than $1000 or $2000.

81
00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:40.840
But it comes with a price and the price is that the downside is huge as well so that you will is very

82
00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:47.940
very dangerous that you can also get very low like very high losses.

83
00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:51.510
And you if you get a couple of those in a row because the stats.

84
00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:55.390
These things can come randomly you could get a couple of these in a row and that's as much a margin

85
00:05:55.390 --> 00:06:00.820
call right away like that means that all of your funds are lost and your account is frozen.

86
00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:08.890
And so what's just finishing up wrapping up this little side note what traders generally prefer is this

87
00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:15.570
like the smallest division because the standard deviation in finances is similar.

88
00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:20.670
Our can be considered as a metric for risk.

89
00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:22.710
You can see that here.

90
00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:30.360
The celebration is lower and therefore probability of getting like a very bad result is lower ours in

91
00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:31.340
the second scenario.

92
00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:38.590
It's it's more and it's not just about trading as as we discussed in the disclaimers this tutorial is

93
00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:45.100
not to discuss trading it's to discuss the effects or implications of or the side note is there to discuss

94
00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:48.780
the implications of standard deviation on whatever you are observing.

95
00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:55.270
And this is a great example is just very visual and impactful that even though in this case you have

96
00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:56.980
a small mean.

97
00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:02.380
And if you had a small standard deviation you know what is one thing compared to if you have the same

98
00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:04.870
mean but you have a huge standard deviation.

99
00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:13.660
It kind of it really diminishes the value of having a positive mean loofa negative mean you might as

100
00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:20.740
well have had a negative mean and you would have gotten worse result but it wouldn't differ that much

101
00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:27.850
in terms of the randomness because randomness adds like you could be getting values from here or from

102
00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:33.670
here so the fact that you have a positive mean doesn't matter that much so that's what's that's what

103
00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:37.030
a lot of people actually forget when they're trading for instance.

104
00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:38.140
They just worry about this.

105
00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:39.810
They don't think about this.

106
00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:44.100
They lead like oh I'm getting a positive expected return.

107
00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:46.060
But what is your standard deviation.

108
00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:50.540
What is the risk associated with your trading or this investment fund.

109
00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:57.220
And as you can see from this discussion this investment fund isn't doing a good job at all if they're

110
00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:01.390
not there trades or all trades are distributed in this way.

111
00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:09.010
So it's something that you know like it is is kind of like a I would say is a subpar investment fund

112
00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:11.290
but again that's not about finances.

113
00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:14.120
This is something this is more about statistics anyway.

114
00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:16.350
So let's move on here.

115
00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:20.980
We've got our solution templates we're going to continue working in the same template size approach.

116
00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:27.420
We spoke about last time because it's going to be familiar and convenient and I didn't even bother drawing

117
00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:30.320
a lipless distribution here because what's the point.

118
00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:35.020
We don't really mind what distribution we have in the underlying population which are going to use the

119
00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:36.640
Central Limit Theorem.

120
00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:40.200
And so let's see how you did this challenge and let's compare.

121
00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:40.640
All right.

122
00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:47.080
So my mean all the sampling distribution of the sample mean was turned out to be ninety five point seventy.

123
00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:51.990
I hope you got the same result because that's exactly the same as we have in the original distribution.

124
00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:59.170
Then my standard deviation of the sampling distribution over the sample mean is segmented by square

125
00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:03.750
of 100 or 1 2 4 7 divide by 10 is $124 70.

126
00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:06.370
Our target is $20000.

127
00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:07.360
So we're solving.

128
00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:08.560
Which one are we solving.

129
00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:10.260
I think it's part.

130
00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:14.170
Part B or a when one of them our target was.

131
00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:16.110
Let me just quickly check which one it was.

132
00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:19.340
So you were solving part B first so the target.

133
00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:19.820
What is it.

134
00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:25.950
What is the probability of us reaching this target our target $20000.

135
00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:30.660
So X critical is 20000 dollars and divide by 100.

136
00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:36.200
So meaning that in those 100 trays that we get some can be profiteroles How can you losses something

137
00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:37.600
bigger sunken to be smaller.

138
00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:45.370
But what we want is that on average the each trade is on average among them let each trait among them.

139
00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:52.360
On average a trades are two 100 or bring a profit of $200 portrayed on average.

140
00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:59.350
That's what we that's a characteristic which we want for our sample that we're going to have.

141
00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:04.490
Once that week is over once those traits are done if that characteristic is true then we've reached

142
00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:06.260
outargued if that currency risk is false.

143
00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:07.240
We haven't reached out.

144
00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:12.140
So if it's less than 200 So we actually want it to be equally critical is the minimum we want it to

145
00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:14.170
be two hundred or more if it's less than we didn't.

146
00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:19.470
We won't we just we won't reach our target regardless of what our individual trades are.

147
00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:23.840
If on average out of 100 trades they are less than two hundred dollars per trade.

148
00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:27.810
Then we just multiply 200 by 100 get less than 20000.

149
00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:28.520
OK.

150
00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:32.850
So next step is let's draw that it's critical there it is.

151
00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:36.730
That's the distance and now let's calculate the Zed's score.

152
00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:43.760
The score is X critical minus myu X bar divided by Sigma X bar.

153
00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:45.530
We plug everything in two hundred miles.

154
00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:48.890
Ninety five point seventy divided by one twenty four point seventy.

155
00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:53.030
So here I wanted to point out 200 minus ninety five point seven.

156
00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:59.300
That sounds like a lot even when I was doing this challenge myself I felt like whoa that's huge.

157
00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:02.000
So it's like 105 104.

158
00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:08.480
You still have 104 in the numerator and you remember in your Zed in that tables they're usually like

159
00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:15.310
you know was zero point something or onepoint something because that's the distances and certain deviations.

160
00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:23.680
So if you think about it this distance between X critical and myu X is huge is 100 dollars so far away.

161
00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:31.880
But the thing is that in our case a Sigma X bar so the sound deviation even of the sampling distribution

162
00:11:31.890 --> 00:11:39.440
even after we divided by 10 is so large that it still will beat this value it'll make its much smaller

163
00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:40.640
when you divide by that.

164
00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:47.010
So basically as you can see from here 0.4 so are actually are x critical is not there.

165
00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:51.630
It's inside here it's in between it's between Immunex and C-Max bar.

166
00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:57.170
It's actually sitting over here simply because our this is not the best image.

167
00:11:57.170 --> 00:12:03.080
Our distribution is actually very wide like that it's like that.

168
00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:03.430
All right.

169
00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:06.290
But this is just to just to keep us like on track.

170
00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:11.850
It's just a graphic rather than an actual representation of get real and not really relying on this

171
00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:15.950
image just just for guiding us through this challenge.

172
00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:20.220
All right so basically zero point eighty four we go to the table.

173
00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:23.030
Where is our table of these that table.

174
00:12:23.450 --> 00:12:27.470
OK that table let's have a look.

175
00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:31.980
Zero point eight right zero point eighty four.

176
00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:35.150
OK so zero point 7 9 9 5.

177
00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:42.200
But let's remember that's that is that part the left part of the it's always whatever from here to the

178
00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:44.510
left you can see even here is always from here to the left.

179
00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:46.410
That's easy to remember it's always the left side.

180
00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:49.160
So zero point 7 9 9 5.

181
00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:50.850
We want the right side.

182
00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:58.760
So we do that x is greater than x critical is mine mine is zero point so 9 and 5 is twenty point zero

183
00:12:58.760 --> 00:12:59.680
five percent.

184
00:12:59.690 --> 00:13:06.930
So there's a 20 percent chance of making $20000 in a given week which pretty decent.

185
00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:08.450
Pretty decent chance.

186
00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:12.520
Now let's have a look at the chance of making a loss.

187
00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:14.460
Second part of the challenge.

188
00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:17.720
All right this doesn't change because it's same distribution.

189
00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:24.990
The only thing that changes is where we're setting X critical so critical threshold this time is $0.

190
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.500
Instead of calling it target I'm calling a critical threshold because it's not really a target.

191
00:13:29.570 --> 00:13:31.150
It's something to be.

192
00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:35.270
We want I want to stay away from but distributions don't really care about that.

193
00:13:35.270 --> 00:13:41.200
Distributions are going to or variables and samplings are just going to do their thing.

194
00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:44.250
Randomness is going to be randomness whether we will like it or not.

195
00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:48.900
So X critical is a 0 divided by 100.

196
00:13:48.950 --> 00:13:53.270
So that's the critical threshold so how how many.

197
00:13:53.270 --> 00:13:59.930
Remember how many dollars per trade do we want or do we want do we not want in this case $0 portrayed.

198
00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:07.220
Obviously So if you if you want your know critical to be 0 then on average your trades should bring

199
00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:07.810
zero.

200
00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:10.190
Just just basic division by hand.

201
00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:12.010
And let's plot that.

202
00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:14.070
So let's say are x critical somewhere there.

203
00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:15.210
That's the distance.

204
00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:21.080
Let's calculate that Zad equals x critical minus myu ex-parte to add C-Max bar.

205
00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:24.200
Plug them in zero minus ninety five point seventy.

206
00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:26.410
Divide by 124 dots.

207
00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:32.090
As you can see we're going to get a negative one again because this is looks like a lot but because

208
00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:38.360
the standard vision is so high you know if it was like for this would be a lot this would be like close

209
00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:43.730
to close to 20 20 to 23 24 somewhere on there minus 24.

210
00:14:43.730 --> 00:14:47.920
But because this is so so high as well is going to be mine is zero point seventy seven.

211
00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:49.780
So again it's critical wasn't actually there.

212
00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:57.280
It's actually in between it's between the main and the first standard deviation to the left.

213
00:14:57.290 --> 00:15:00.600
OK so now let's look at the tables.

214
00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:03.050
So mine is zero point seventy seven.

215
00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:04.520
Scroll up.

216
00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:08.490
All right minus 0.7 maybe zoom in a little bit.

217
00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:09.120
Zero point.

218
00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:09.600
There it is.

219
00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:18.350
Mine is there point seven and this one this one there were 20 to 06 and that's that part.

220
00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:20.170
So that's exactly what we need.

221
00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:24.900
That's or what we don't want but that's what we were calculating.

222
00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:32.810
So X minus the Prabhudheva XP might lessen X critical is zero point 2 2 0 6 22 0 6 percent 22 percent

223
00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:36.690
of making a loss in a given week.

224
00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:37.310
So there we go.

225
00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:39.690
And again this one is in between here.

226
00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:42.020
So let's actually plot these out together.

227
00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:48.260
So we're just these are the parameters over there at the top so we remember them for a bit of a wider

228
00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:49.660
sampling distribution.

229
00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:52.070
There our new X bar.

230
00:15:52.190 --> 00:16:00.450
There's a Sigma X bar and so that is the probability of making over $20000 in a given week.

231
00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:06.040
And that is the probability of making a loss in a given week.

232
00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:07.910
So anything below zero dollars.

233
00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:16.610
And as you can see the ability here is a bit greater than here because this was zero point eighty 80s.

234
00:16:16.650 --> 00:16:19.370
84 I think or 0.37 or something.

235
00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:22.140
Yeah this was minus 0.27.

236
00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:22.740
So that's.

237
00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:24.710
Is this on a zero point 84.

238
00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:32.210
So this one is a bit closer to the center as to the mean and therefore the probability is capturing

239
00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:35.420
more of this upside or more of this curve.

240
00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:40.160
So operability is pretty high profile is behind this is what you were talking about so the both the

241
00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:42.370
upside is high and the downside is high.

242
00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:48.440
So there's a 22 percent chance that in a week in a given week there will be no profit whatever it will

243
00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:49.340
be a loss.

244
00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:59.000
And there's a 20 20 percent chance that there'll be a $20000 profit or more and there's a fifty seven

245
00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:04.160
point eighty nine percent chance that something else will happen so anything between zero dollars remember

246
00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:06.440
this is zero to $20000.

247
00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:12.800
So overall this is not that bad if they're going to do 100 trades and that's a whole.

248
00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:15.380
They maintain that that distribution.

249
00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:20.310
You can see that like the power of numbers when it's one trade it's pretty berzerk.

250
00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:24.950
But when if they if they can do 100 that's a lot of traders like 20 trades per day because it's only

251
00:17:24.950 --> 00:17:25.910
five business days.

252
00:17:26.090 --> 00:17:31.670
But if you're going to 20 trades per day and do like 100 in a week because you do that you have the

253
00:17:31.670 --> 00:17:37.250
square root of the of an four to send deviation of the sampling mean.

254
00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:40.300
This one becomes narrower it's narrower than that.

255
00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:46.430
The sampling mean distribution is narrower than the or the standard vision is narrower than the one

256
00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:51.420
of the original population and kind of like helps out I guess with things so.

257
00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:58.040
So the situation is not that bad is only a 22 percent chance of having a loss in a given week.

258
00:17:58.040 --> 00:17:59.730
And you know like what.

259
00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:07.570
Twenty two hundred minus 22 so 70 78 percent chance or nearly 78 percent chance of having a profit.

260
00:18:07.730 --> 00:18:08.200
So there we go.

261
00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:15.740
That's a there's another good or Vivat actually example of how the central limit theorem can be super

262
00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:17.090
super powerful.

263
00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:22.180
Hope you can also see that and I hope you're successful with this challenge.

264
00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:27.080
There's definitely lots of applications of social mental limit theorem if you'd like more exercise.

265
00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:33.160
Just google the central limit theorem exercise or challenge or problem.

266
00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:37.480
And there's lots and lots of different examples that you can go through in lots of different industries.

267
00:18:37.490 --> 00:18:41.990
These are just some of the some of the cool ones that I was able to create for you.

268
00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:48.470
But there's definitely lots more available because lots of people studying stats and so the central

269
00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:52.880
limit theorem is just so powerful and used in so many different areas.

270
00:18:53.240 --> 00:19:00.590
And on that note I am super excited that we've completed the Solve the central theorem and can wait

271
00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:03.530
to keep going and learning more stuff together.

272
00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:05.760
You and I will see you next time.

273
00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:07.520
Until then happy analyzing.
