Hello and welcome back.
1

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:03,820
What is A distribution.
2

3
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:05,410
So let's have a look.
3

4
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:10,710
According to Wikipedia A distribution or probability distribution is a mathematical function that stated
4

5
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:16,470
in simple terms can be thought of as providing the probability of occurrence of different possible outcomes
5

6
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:17,970
in an experiment.
6

7
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:20,710
So very interesting definition.
7

8
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:26,120
Let's think of what a distribution so the main take away from here is that it's a mathematical function.
8

9
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:33,870
Let's see what a distribution is for us in terms of data analytics business analytics data sience what
9

10
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:35,020
is a distribution.
10

11
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:37,610
And we're back to our dataset.
11

12
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:43,710
Probably you are expecting unless you're quite adept to distributions you're probably expecting
12

13
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:48,850
a chart like a graph a bell curve or something.
13

14
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,060
But that is a common misconception.
14

15
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:58,440
I specifically didn't want to start by showing a chart because too many people think that a distribution
15

16
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:02,930
is a chart and distribution is associated with a chart like our distribution.
16

17
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:05,730
You always think of a chart chart you see a bell curve you think of distribution.
17

18
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:07,190
It's not the same thing.
18

19
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:14,210
Distribution is actual a distribution is actually something that's Associates a function as we saw.
19

20
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:19,910
So if we go back here is a mathematical function that state and simple terms can thorough spraying probably
20

21
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:26,060
the occurrence of different possible outcomes it says nothing about chart says nothing about a curve.
21

22
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:33,390
A distribution is a function which is linked to the underlying data to the underlying observations.
22

23
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,370
Did it have that word outcomes.
23

24
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:36,820
Well in this case outcomes.
24

25
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,210
Well that's about experiments in our case.
25

26
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:47,070
In our case an experiment in the case of data analytics and experiment is us picking a random variable
26

27
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:48,810
from our data.
27

28
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:51,230
So for instance here you've got age.
28

29
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:53,040
So there's our age.
29

30
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:53,870
There it is.
30

31
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,520
We pick a random one that's our experiment.
31

32
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,650
What's the possible outcome.
32

33
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:00,480
While the outcome can be only one of the values that we have here.
33

34
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:06,690
So a distribution is a function which will tell us what is the probability of getting 59 operability
34

35
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,020
getting 31 or 40 or so on.
35

36
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:10,830
Or another way to think about it.
36

37
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,740
Probably a better way to think about it is.
37

38
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:19,140
OK so this is because that'll work better for balance variables like our in this case age.
38

39
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,380
Remember we talked about continuous versus discrete.
39

40
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:27,330
So if this second way of thinking about is better for continuous variables which age actually age is
40

41
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:29,150
a continuous variable is just random.
41

42
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:35,520
So because for balance for instance you can just say OK so what is a probability if I pick a random
42

43
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:41,160
roll from this data set was a probability of getting let's say one hundred ninety seven point thirty
43

44
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:41,680
three.
44

45
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:45,490
Well what happens if you don't have that value is operability 0.
45

46
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:51,750
Well that's because the proper The best way to think about it the second way which I've been mentioning.
46

47
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:57,940
Two way to think about it is to say OK what is the probability So this is our data set.
47

48
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:04,610
And now we're going to add a new random person in here so and we know that that person will look like.
48

49
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:07,010
Kind of like the the people that we already have.
49

50
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:12,780
What is the probability that that person will have one hundred ninety-seven dot thirty-three dollars
50

51
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:13,830
in their bank account or what.
51

52
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,860
What is the probability that that person will be will have will be 37 years old.
52

53
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:23,280
What does that probability that that person will be a male or female or be residing in this in this
53

54
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,750
country or in this country.
54

55
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:28,060
So that's the better probably probably the better way to imagine it.
55

56
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:33,610
And as you can see again it has nothing so far to do with charts or graphs or bell curves and so on.
56

57
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,070
All of that comes later.
57

58
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,940
Well just now just now in a few seconds.
58

59
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:43,200
But there is an auxiliary element that is a supplementary thing that will help us understand aids us
59

60
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:44,500
and understand these reasons.
60

61
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,280
So let's proceed to that part.
61

62
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:52,650
We're going to shorten this dataset  just so we have some space and we're going to look at two specific
62

63
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:55,750
verbal So we'll look at age group and look at balance.
63

64
00:03:55,980 --> 00:04:01,860
And we're going to talk about distributions and you'll see that they're different a bit different for
64

65
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,140
discrete and continuous variable.
65

66
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:06,380
That's why we specifically picked a discrete variable.
66

67
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:11,820
So age is debatable whether you wanted to be discrete or continuous in this case is probably continuous
67

68
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:16,440
whereas age group you can see that it's intentionally been made discrete that there's only certain color.
68

69
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,740
So this is definitely a discrete verbal balance.
69

70
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:22,070
It's continuous because it's not in cerned buckets.
70

71
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,010
All right.
71

72
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:29,670
So discrete let's plot the distribution and the description of this variable would look like something
72

73
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,800
for instance like that and.
73

74
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:37,080
Well the chart for this distribution would look something that's a bar chart and that's how distributions
74

75
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:43,620
are presented for discrete variables because you only have CRN limited you have a finite number of categories
75

76
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:48,580
or a finite number of possible outcomes as if we're talking about exponent you have finite number of
76

77
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:49,680
possible outcomes.
77

78
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:55,020
When you're dealing with this variable so you have for instance 10 to 20 20 to 30 30 to 40 50 50 50
78

79
00:04:55,020 --> 00:05:03,070
60 60 70 years old in among the customers of this bank and what is this what is this whole chart about.
79

80
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:08,950
Well let's put a 0.3 here we'll explain just now just in 10 to 20, 20 to 30 and so on.
80

81
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:16,480
And so what this chart is showing us is what is the probability of if we pick a person from this dataset.
81

82
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:23,340
Or as we said in the way of thinking about it number two if we just randomly create a new person that
82

83
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:25,080
that enters the bank.
83

84
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:30,190
What is the probability of them becoming a being and this in this bucket this bucket this bucket And
84

85
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:36,680
so here is probably probabilities like 30 percent of them being here maybe 25 of them being here maybe
85

86
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,110
5 percent or less than that being here.
86

87
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:39,640
And so on.
87

88
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,980
So this is what the chart gives us.
88

89
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:48,880
It's it gives us the probabilities of a person being in one of these groups and for instance here probability
89

90
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:55,190
of the person of X that variable being 30 to 40 it causes 0.3 percent.
90

91
00:05:55,190 --> 00:06:00,230
So that's how discreet The visualization of discrete distributions works.
91

92
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:01,840
Now let's talk about continuous.
92

93
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:07,430
So there's continuous let's draw that this is going to be a bit more interesting a bit more complex
93

94
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:09,600
simply because it's continuous.
94

95
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:15,260
So there is always 0 and the continuous distribution is a continuous line.
95

96
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:18,500
And what does this line mean and how does it work.
96

97
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:24,580
Well let's have a look let's say that seven point five, doesn't matter that there is 7.3
97

98
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:26,240
these different charts.
98

99
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,590
This is 0.5.
99

100
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:33,260
And let's say that we here we have valances or we're realizing the chart or graph of distribution
100

101
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,020
for the balance verbal.
101

102
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:43,430
Let's say we have $10000 here on this chart So what does it mean that the peak here is at  $10000
102

103
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:45,650
or whatever value we get here what does it mean.
103

104
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:52,430
So if I draw a line here can I say that the probability of a person in this data set or if a new person
104

105
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:59,510
comes to this bank can I say that the probability of them having $10000 in the bank account is 50 percent.
105

106
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:00,740
So can I say that.
106

107
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:04,100
Well let's imagine that that is true for a second.
107

108
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:09,260
Let's say Yes that's the case just like we had with the discrete distribution that this probability
108

109
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:13,350
tells you what's what's the likelihood that this variable will be exactly in this book.
109

110
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:17,710
Well in that case remember we said that there's a limited number of observations here.
110

111
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,040
Like here we only had five or six.
111

112
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:23,480
I hear there's a limit number so we take 11000.
112

113
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:26,390
So according to this chart a probability is what.
113

114
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:28,810
And then we take 12000 according to this chart.
114

115
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:33,800
The probability is what 49 percent and then the probability for 12000 is 42 percent.
115

116
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:37,420
Well they already add up to more than one just these three values.
116

117
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:43,940
And so that can't be the case our assumption that what we're seeing here is the probability of that exact
117

118
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,240
value is incorrect.
118

119
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:49,480
And that's why we can't do that the correct way of thinking about this is through areas.
119

120
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:56,150
So this curve over here that we see is actually called the probability density function or the PTF and
120

121
00:07:56,330 --> 00:08:02,130
the probability of having this one value is pretty much zero.
121

122
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:06,260
That's how this function works and that's how pretty much everything in the world works when you're
122

123
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:12,110
dealing with continuous variables because there's unlimited values on this axis and we're actually going
123

124
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:17,530
to include a separate tutorial about that called the Cantor's diagonal argument so it's really cool
124

125
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:21,180
proof of why there's unlimited values on this.
125

126
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:28,490
Between like 0 and 1 billion dollars or even between 0 and 100000 why there's unlimited number of observations
126

127
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:34,940
and the way you pick a random variable is imagining that you throwing a dart at this line and given that
127

128
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:37,940
you hit the line you throwing a dart at this line.
128

129
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:43,810
And because as infinity numbers between 0 and here there's an infinity number.
129

130
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,630
The probability of you landing is that the dart landed exactly in 10000 is zero.
130

131
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:49,870
It's converges to zero.
131

132
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:54,710
So the probability of exactly 10000 0 but the correct way of thinking about these areas so you take
132

133
00:08:54,920 --> 00:09:01,640
10000 plus a little bit 10000 minus a little bit and then the probability of that dark landing inside
133

134
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:08,930
there is going to be given by the area of this little shaded part of the chart that we've created here.
134

135
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:15,380
So as you can see as the air is wider the probability will be higher so probability of your dart or your
135

136
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:21,430
random variable that you pick out of your distribution because it doesn't have to be from a dataset
136

137
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:27,350
you did your distribution has a function which is a or this column has a function a pre-build this function
137

138
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:31,790
assigned to attached to it which is the which characterizes the distribution.
138

139
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:35,810
And so basically you're picking from this probability density function that's what we said that the
139

140
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:40,760
second approach of thinking about it that somebody new enters the bank the probability that their balance
140

141
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:45,410
is going to be between nine and a half thousand dollars and ten thousand dollars is a shaded area under
141

142
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:46,730
the curve over here.
142

143
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:53,330
And in terms of mathematics we're not going to go into calculus here but that is integration.
143

144
00:09:53,330 --> 00:10:00,250
So you need to integrate the area under the curve between 9500 to 10500 and that's are you to integrate
144

145
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,200
the curve and that's going to be your value.
145

146
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:02,950
That's a probability.
146

147
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:07,770
So basically or in simple terms thing is the best way to think about is just the area under the curve.
147

148
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:14,380
And if you extend this area and of course like if you take from not 9500 you take from 8000
148

149
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:18,100
to 12000 you know the area is going to be bigger and the probability is going to be bigger.
149

150
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:22,820
And ultimately if you take from zero to a million probably is going to be 100 percent.
150

151
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:25,590
So that's how the probability density function works.
151

152
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,220
And that's the difference between discrete distributions and continues distributions.
152

153
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:36,700
Important to understand that distribution kind of the key probably key takeaway for today is that distribution
153

154
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:43,180
is attached to the variable or to this in our case column itself or other than just the chart or anything
154

155
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:43,420
else.
155

156
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:49,960
And so in this case you have a discrete distribution in this case you have a continuous distribution
156

157
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:57,040
characterized by a probability density function both of which can help you understand what is the likelihood
157

158
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,210
of a certain event occurring.
158

159
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,900
No just approaches the different if you have a discrete distribution.
159

160
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,170
It's very simple you just pick the bucket that you're interested in and look at the probability in terms
160

161
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:07,760
of a continuous distributions it is a bit more complex.
161

162
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,790
You need to find the value looking for.
162

163
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:15,490
You can't just find probably one value because in continue in the world of continuous variables the
163

164
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:18,190
probability of one value is always going to be zero.
164

165
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:20,480
You can only find probabilities of ranges.
165

166
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:24,280
So the probability of the range is going to be the shaded area under the curve.
166

167
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:25,050
So there you are.
167

168
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:31,230
Hopefully that's kind of simplifies and makes it a bit clearer what distributions are and how their
168

169
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:32,560
problems are governed.
169

170
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:34,250
And that's all for today.
170

171
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:36,140
I look forward to seeing you on the next tutorial.
171

172
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,750
Until then happy analyzing.
