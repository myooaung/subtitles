00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:02,720
Hey guys it's Kiril here.

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,280
I just thought I'd quickly pop into the course.

3
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:07,280
I hope I'm not disrupting your flow.

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:14,250
I just wanted to show you an example of how values can be used or misuse or create ambiguity just like

5
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,250
what we talked about in the previous tutorial.

6
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:21,370
So here I went to the pharmacy in Australia and I bought this just to show you.

7
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,610
So have a look.

8
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:24,170
Is it cold right.

9
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:28,770
It's day and night and here on the right.

10
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:35,960
Let me show you just here on the right you can see it says clinically proven.

11
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:39,770
And then here it says what does it say clinically proven to shorten your call.

12
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:41,320
So you see that purple sign over there.

13
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:43,540
Clinically proven to Schorno cold.

14
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:46,380
That's that's awesome but that's exactly what we're talking about.

15
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:50,430
They've proven that it shortens the cold but by how much.

16
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:54,660
There's no there's no mention of the magnitude of the effect if you look at this whole box.

17
00:00:54,720 --> 00:01:01,060
If you look at the back of the box this is like barrooms anywhere you look on the box.

18
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:04,230
You won't find how what the effect is.

19
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:09,450
They just they've proven you know they got a p value of less than 5 percent or less than 1 percent and

20
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:13,950
you know that's it's just like as we are doing the hypothesis testing part of course you know they've

21
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:21,600
proven that it has reduced or it is lower for for people who take this medicine but what's the magnitude

22
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,240
of the fact is no mention of that so that's what you're going to be careful of.

23
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:31,080
And you know like things like this it's marketing it's it's you know it's a catchy term and it's ok.

24
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:36,720
Like I guess if they want to just sell the product and then maybe if they're diligent about it they

25
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,000
can follow up on another website they might have someone more information about this.

26
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:47,610
But in business of course when you're the one making the gain the insides and creating that or like

27
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:52,020
deriving insights and communicating them and some people are relying on your insides to make business

28
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:57,670
decisions you have to be very careful about OK it's slower or is greater but what does that mean.

29
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:03,450
What is the what we're after and what does that mean like in terms of the magnitude of the effect and

30
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:07,710
how can we apply this in terms of operations or whatever we're estimating.

31
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:11,920
So there you go just be careful with these values if you use them wisely.

32
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:19,080
They can totally serve your purpose and really be a very powerful tool in your toolkit.

33
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,390
And I'll Accorsi on NEXT.

34
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:22,830
Until then happy analyzing.
