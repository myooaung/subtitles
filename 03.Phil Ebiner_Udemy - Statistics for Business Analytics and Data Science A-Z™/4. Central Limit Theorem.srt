00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:03,120
Hello welcome back to the course on business statistics.

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:06,260
And today we're talking about the Central Limit Theorem.

3
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:08,650
It's a super exciting topic.

4
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:15,680
I've got a very interesting troll prepared and more importantly the central limit theorem is said to

5
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:23,360
be the most important theorem of statistics and probably even the whole of mathematics.

6
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:29,810
And the reason for that is how useful it is to us when we are observing the world running experiments

7
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:31,910
assessing populations and so on.

8
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:35,710
And how powerful it is in itself.

9
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:41,060
So being powerful doesn't mean has to be super complex will break it down into simple steps just now

10
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:43,030
and it'll all make total sense.

11
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:47,810
And then at the end of the section you'll see a very applied example of how it is used.

12
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:49,830
But other than that we'll go through a couple.

13
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:55,340
We'll mention a couple of examples where it is also used in the world and you'll see we will start to

14
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:59,360
like the whole puzzle start to come together why it's so important.

15
00:00:59,360 --> 00:00:59,600
All right.

16
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,900
So let's get started.

17
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:07,250
We stopped over here where we have the population with the parameters the sample with statistics and

18
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:13,190
then we introduce the sampling distribution where we've taken lots and lots of different samples from

19
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:19,070
our population randomly and we've recorded the sample mean for every time.

20
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:25,730
And then we are now going to look at what does that distribution look like what does the distribution

21
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:31,000
or what is the sampling distribution of the sample mean look like.

22
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:36,120
All right so let's get rid of this temporary Rathore we had and are you ready for this.

23
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:44,120
The central limit states that the sampling distribution given that you've taken enough samples but the

24
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:49,640
sampling distribution of the sample mean will be will look like that.

25
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:52,950
And basically it will be a normal distribution.

26
00:01:53,180 --> 00:02:00,550
And that is regardless of what population you had what kind of distribution you had in the population.

27
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,060
And that is the real power.

28
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:08,150
So let's let's just reiterate what happened here as let's start from the population from the top so

29
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:09,830
this moving things to the left.

30
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:14,250
Let's say we have a population and it has its own distribution.

31
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:16,880
It could be height height of people.

32
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:23,270
And for some reason in this place in this location that you're analyzing there's there's a very two

33
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:30,500
different distributions like cancer that is very tall people Giants and very very short people might

34
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,720
be like on a different planet or something.

35
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:37,430
It could be it could be a completely different distribution could be an exponential distribution could

36
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:42,500
be any type of absolutely any type of distribution it doesn't matter what it looks like.

37
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:46,760
But we're going to use this example because it's very different to a normal distribution.

38
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:49,230
Just to make that point clear.

39
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:52,040
So you have a population with a distribution like that.

40
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:55,490
And then if you take one sample from that distribution.

41
00:02:55,490 --> 00:03:01,430
So the red part we here that we had if you take one sample from this distribution what it will look

42
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:01,760
like.

43
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:04,860
While it could look like something like this doesn't have to.

44
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:08,660
Samples are random so you might get a lot from the left or from the right.

45
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:13,740
But generally speaking this is a valid sample that you could get from this population.

46
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:18,380
And as you can see it kind of resembles the population a bit and the more you take.

47
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:24,950
So these are in every single box here is an observation that you took from a population the more you

48
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:31,430
take the larger your sample the closer will generally be to your population distribution but it doesn't

49
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:31,730
have to.

50
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:36,940
Again you could have just gone all of the boxes from here just randomly or all the boxes from here.

51
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:40,450
And those are really two things that are quite restrictive about the sample.

52
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:48,470
So by taking a sample you might get something that resembles in a way your population distribution which

53
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:52,910
you don't know anything about and therefore how can you model it.

54
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:56,060
How can you come up with equations for it and so on.

55
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:59,200
So even if you can resemble it is not really helpful.

56
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:03,770
And the second thing is that there is not much there's a chance that you'll get something different

57
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:09,950
you'll just be by chance because of your the way your samples have the sample was picked you might get

58
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:14,990
something that's all over here or over there so it's completely unreliable in that sense given that

59
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:18,990
you don't know your popular underlying population distribution that can be completely around.

60
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:20,910
Doesn't have to be a normal distribution.

61
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:26,720
But then when you take the sampling distribution what happens is magic basically it's always going to

62
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,100
be a normal distribution.

63
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:33,500
So that's what the central limit their home states and that's just scratching the surface of the central

64
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,030
and that they're kind of like the overall concept.

65
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:39,760
There's there's much more to it than We'll talk about that in the next Tauriel.

66
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:43,900
But just that in itself is a super powerful concept.

67
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:50,240
And the reason why that is so important is because we can apply it in so many different ways and in

68
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,060
our lives in the world.

69
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:57,460
Take for instance a book and look at the oh look at the length of words in your book.

70
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:02,900
So they won't be distributed normally in no way you will have very short words with one letter.

71
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:10,820
For instance I or a then you'll have the lens of words peaks around about four letters because you have

72
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,620
a lot of words such as the.

73
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,810
And and so on that are used very commonly.

74
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:22,280
And then it drops off but you can have words which are up to 10 12 letters long and so on.

75
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,470
So it kind of goes like goes up and then goes down like that.

76
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:32,450
So it's not a normal distribution but at the same time if you take the average length of all of the

77
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:35,660
words on every single page for a book.

78
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:41,270
So basically your page is your sample and you take the average length of all of the words on your page

79
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:44,330
and then you do that for every single page in the book.

80
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:48,850
Then you look at the sampling distribution of those averages that you got.

81
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:51,050
It will be a normal distribution.

82
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:55,520
Another example of how powerful the central limit theorem is our Belgica school systems.

83
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:02,360
Why is it the case that often involves legal systems researchers can treat things that are happening

84
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,800
as if they were normally distributed.

85
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:11,510
Well the reason for that is that in Belgica systems when you have something happening for instance you're

86
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:16,950
observing how a some sort of Medicine what kind of effect it has on a human being.

87
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:22,940
Well that is the result of thousands and thousands and thousands of random events.

88
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,790
And even though we might not know the underlying distribution of those events in the human body.

89
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:34,670
But what we do know is that once we take the sampling distributions if we treat all of those events

90
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:40,710
as samples of a sum distribution and then we take the sampling distribution of the sample mean.

91
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:45,350
Or so you take the means as we can see here you take all the means for all of those events and you take

92
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:52,610
sampling distribution then it will be distributed normally and that is superpowerful of course it's

93
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:53,830
much more complex than that.

94
00:06:53,950 --> 00:07:01,010
And I'm not a researcher in medicine or biological system so I can't comment on that thoroughly but

95
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:08,430
that is the intuition behind what is going on there and why the central limit theorem has so much application.

96
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:14,960
And and but for us of course it's more important in business scenarios and there are cases when you

97
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:21,390
can extract additional information for business events using the power of the central limit theorem

98
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:25,810
and people around you will be like whoa already you just do that.

99
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,100
What just happened.

100
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:33,290
But because you know the beauty of the Central Limit Theorem and the power of it you will if you train

101
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:38,720
yourself up you will know when exactly you should apply it and how you can get information insights

102
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:44,030
or insights and sense traces when others simply don't know what to do.

103
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:48,250
And on that note there was the intro to the central limit theorem.

104
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:54,350
In the next to Tauriel we'll go dive a bit deeper and have a bit of a play around with some practical

105
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:54,800
stuff.

106
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:58,990
So I hope you enjoyed today's tutorial and I look forward to seeing you next time.

107
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,590
Until then help analyzing.
