00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,260
Hello and welcome back to the course.

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:07,860
My name is Vitale and today I'm going to talk about the Pareto Principle.

3
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:15,040
It is an exciting topic used by the businesses daily hourly and probably every minute and every second.

4
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:22,710
Somewhere in the world it's an important principle of prioritization and I am so keen to share some

5
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:29,590
tips and tricks a bit of a history and some core my whole understanding of this prince.

6
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,660
So let's dig into it.

7
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:39,050
We'll start with a bit of a history and it's going to tell you how these principle originated.

8
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:44,030
It's all started from a person called Will Fred-O Perito.

9
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:52,620
He was the Italian economist and in his study of course the economy politic Berita has observed a very

10
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,650
important correlation.

11
00:00:55,830 --> 00:01:05,310
When he started the ownership of Eataly he realized that roughly 80 percent of all Italian land has

12
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:10,360
been owned by 20 percent of the population.

13
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:18,000
Disproportioned surprise Perito and he did a few service on other countries and to his great surprise

14
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,420
these proportions stayed roughly the same.

15
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:32,230

16
80:20 80 percent of Whilce land or similar metric has been owned by 20 percent of the population.

17
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:40,530
That was exciting and lead to later on a big discovery of this principle.

18
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:48,280
But there was another person who actually was my colleague management consultant.

19
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:54,830
His name was Joseph Duren he was specializing in quality management systems.

20
00:01:54,970 --> 00:02:05,140
And in his work Joseph Ciaran observed that quite a handful of flaws of the system usually cost the

21
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:13,660
majority of the issues that happened with that system being being accustomed.

22
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:22,720
And knowing the work of will for the Perito Joseph jur on has made and has made an observation that

23
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:30,720
most likely this principle is of a global nature not only applicable to the economy or the quality management

24
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:34,420
but could be something bigger.

25
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:37,460
And he was probably right.

26
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:46,840
These days this principle is used every day in every business and is of very important nature.

27
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:50,920
Let me give you a few basics of this principle.

28
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,350
So we're on the same page.

29
00:02:53,390 --> 00:03:02,970
If you have a system and some input into the system you obviously get something in return which is outputs.

30
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:12,610
So as an example I'm going to give you as an input something like tasks your effort in many hours your

31
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:22,090
investments as a money as outputs you could get something like the benefits or sales or return on your

32
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:23,240
investment.

33
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:33,450
So the principal says that majority of the outputs and let's say 80 percent is closely attributed to

34
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:39,900
the minority to the vital views of the inputs which is roughly 20 percent based on the broader principle

35
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:44,660
and this disproportion is super important and of big significance.

36
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:52,440
So I'll probably state it again roughly 80 percent of the outputs are closely associated with 20 percent

37
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,050
of the inputs.

38
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:55,620
Let me give you a few examples.

39
00:03:55,640 --> 00:04:00,700
So it is crystal clear what we're talking about.

40
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:09,480
Imagine you own a supermarket and the breeder principle applied to the sales of that supermarket of

41
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:18,580
your supermarket would say that roughly 80 percent of all the sales come from just a handful 20 percent

42
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,620
of the customers that visit that supermarket.

43
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:23,330
Why and how could it be.

44
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:31,600
Well the 20 percent of your customers could be the ones that live nearby and stop in your supermarket

45
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,800
very often.

46
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:40,810
They could be the ones that have large families and therefore their basket product basket is pretty

47
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:43,450
big every time they go to the supermarket.

48
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:52,840
They also could be people who follow the healthy lifestyle and prefer to buy things are getting things

49
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:55,690
and things that are

50
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:05,360
more expensive to manufacture healthier and therefore average amount of money that they leave on the

51
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,920
table for the same product is higher than the majority of the rest of the customers.

52
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:18,710
That's why you're just a handful of customers 20 percent could have a larger impact on your business

53
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,750
on your supermarket sales.

54
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:24,030
Why is this important you might ask.

55
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:29,900
Well if you are the owner of the supermarket and you are trying to implement a customer loyalty program

56
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:37,400
which is effectively aimed at retaining your customers making sure that they are super happy with your

57
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:45,800
supermarket and are not going to go to your competitor whom would you target would you have a blanket

58
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:55,460
policy and applied to 100 percent of the customers and make it a uniform average kind of program or

59
00:05:55,460 --> 00:06:01,430
would you try to tailor it to a specific group to the 20 percent of the customers that actually bring

60
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,710
you 80 percent of the benefit.

61
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:07,740
That's a food for thought and effectively it can shape your policy.

62
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:15,900
It can make it effective one and it can help protect your majority of your income.

63
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:19,020
All the sales in that supermarket.

64
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:25,180
There are a few other examples that I would like to share with you and probably less or less comprehensively

65
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:27,220
as the one with the supermarket.

66
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:34,090
But just to give you a flavor of how this principle can be applied in the real life the Baree the principle

67
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:35,290
states.

68
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:45,180
If we apply to the traffic on the streets that's 80 percent of all traffic accidents are probably associated

69
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:50,760
associated with just a handful of drivers roughly 20 percent.

70
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:58,650
And if we look at the statistics we probably will find that this principle holds truth.

71
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:04,370
So how does the government and police can use these outputs.

72
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:14,340
Well if we know the socio demographic characteristics of the these 20 percent of the drivers who usually

73
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:22,170
offend police could potentially be providing the educational programs for that sort of demographics.

74
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:32,610
Let it be for example students or if there are people who I'm just speculating so this is not set in

75
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:41,340
stone or grounded and if for example most of the traffic accidents come from people of the let's say

76
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:53,100
25 to 30 years of age hypothetically on Friday nights after having business drinks or whatnot then the

77
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:56,820
police efforts for breathalyzer potentially should be ending.

78
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:01,200
Exactly that social group and for that specific time.

79
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:03,420
So privatization is quite important.

80
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:12,480
And forward to give you another example which can be applied to your real life and to your everyday

81
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,190
life.

82
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:19,380
If you look at your apartment the one that you're living in at the moment hot whether it's a house you're

83
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:23,850
renting a room or you sharing something like with your parents.

84
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:32,200
And if you think of all the area in that habitat the breeder principle states that 80 percent of your

85
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:39,470
time is probably spent in the 20 percent of the area of that apartment.

86
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:42,150
How can we use it in the everyday life.

87
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:49,320
Well imagine you are planning to buy a house whether it's your second house first house first apartment

88
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:55,230
whether you will be thinking about characteristics or criteria to buy that house.

89
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,800
You might want to consider.

90
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:06,360
Where do you spend most of your time so you can emphasize and prioritize those features in the house

91
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,510
that you are targeting.

92
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:15,030
And the principle is your friend in that this were a couple of examples that I wanted to give you.

93
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:20,210
Let me share a few variations to the principle that could be quite interesting.

94
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:30,080
First of all 80:20 is not a rule set in stone and always has to be the truth.

95
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:35,880
The rule could be 70 20 95 1.

96
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:43,460
The main thing in the break the principle is that there is a disproportion what particular disproportion

97
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:53,480
and what particular ratio that you will find will depend a lot on the situation you're in one not the

98
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,960
two numbers on the left and right hand side.

99
00:09:56,060 --> 00:10:01,380
They shouldn't add up to 100 percent because we are comparing different types of measures.

100
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:09,830
Inputs and outputs do not need to be in the same and usually not the same thing that we are comparing.

101
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:11,850
So it's like comparing apples and oranges.

102
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,000
So 70 20 altogether is 90.

103
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:23,980
Ken Stillstand and other thing is a specific example I wanted to give this is so-called 1 percent instant

104
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:33,980
participation rule the rule states that out of all people who are on the Internet 90 percent of the

105
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:39,760
people usually tend to do the browsing on the collaboration websites.

106
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:48,280
Nine percent of the people usually leave comments or edit content and only 1 percent actually active

107
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:49,960
content creators.

108
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:58,120
So when you think of the Web sites like for example Wikipedia or let me speculate linked in the content

109
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:05,770
the articles and the things that are being produced are likely to be done by only 1 percent of the visitors

110
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,560
or the users up there.

111
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,650
Why is it important.

112
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:14,170
I think you can already get the drift and understand that attracting those people to developing content

113
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:19,600
will be much easier if you don't do it as a broad brush but you do it in a very laser focused way.

114
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:25,980
Another variation is the 90 90 rule.

115
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:31,960
It is a quite humorous way of talking about the code development.

116
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:41,940
So if the way in 99 to rule goes is the first 90 percent of the code developed developed by a developer

117
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:47,000
or programmer accounts for 90 percent of his or her time.

118
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:53,480
But the remaining 10 percent of the code will probably require additional 90 percent of the time.

119
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:56,920
So obviously the time cannot add up to 180 percent.

120
00:11:57,150 --> 00:12:03,870
When you think about it this way but what it says that the if you are to normalized back to 100 percent

121
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:17,190
the majority of the code is done in an disproportionate amount of time then the remaining bits of the

122
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:18,280
code 10 percent.

123
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:25,380
So roughly the same amount of time spent 90 percent and 90 percent as units of time for example.

124
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,730
But the output will be disproportional.

125
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:33,300
In the first instance it is 90 percent of the code and the second is 10 percent of the code.

126
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,510
So I think you got a drift by now of the period of principle.

127
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:42,570
I hope you are going to be enjoying this course and see you in the next tutorial by.
