00:00:01.149  -->  00:00:03.577
<v Instructor>Hey there. And welcome back.</v>
2

2

00:00:03.577  -->  00:00:05.366
The section we're about to build now
3

3

00:00:05.366  -->  00:00:08.952
is my absolute favorite in this entire project.
4

4

00:00:08.952  -->  00:00:10.891
And that's because in this section,
5

5

00:00:10.891  -->  00:00:13.200
you're going to learn how to build an amazing
6

6

00:00:13.200  -->  00:00:15.051
rotating card effect.
7

7

00:00:15.051  -->  00:00:17.184
And to do so you'll learn how to use
8

8

00:00:17.184  -->  00:00:21.545
the perspective and backface-visibility properties in CSS.
9

9

00:00:21.545  -->  00:00:24.571
Plus, you're gonna use background blend modes,
10

10

00:00:24.571  -->  00:00:26.470
and you'll also learn how and when
11

11

00:00:26.470  -->  00:00:29.640
to use the box-decoration break property.
12

12

00:00:29.640  -->  00:00:31.388
So, there are like 200 lines
13

13

00:00:31.388  -->  00:00:33.854
of SAS code in this section alone.
14

14

00:00:33.854  -->  00:00:35.604
So let's get to work.
15

15

00:00:36.790  -->  00:00:39.248
And here is what we're gonna build in this section.
16

16

00:00:39.248  -->  00:00:41.532
So we have the three cards here
17

17

00:00:41.532  -->  00:00:44.553
and as soon as we hover them they rotate like this.
18

18

00:00:44.553  -->  00:00:45.859
So I showed you this before.
19

19

00:00:45.859  -->  00:00:47.396
But now that we're gonna build it
20

20

00:00:47.396  -->  00:00:48.844
let's take a look at it again.
21

21

00:00:48.844  -->  00:00:50.797
So, we hover it and we rotate
22

22

00:00:50.797  -->  00:00:52.637
and when we hover this button here of course
23

23

00:00:52.637  -->  00:00:54.387
we have this effect,
24

24

00:00:54.387  -->  00:00:55.690
and, yeah.
25

25

00:00:55.690  -->  00:00:57.927
And also in this section we have, of course,
26

26

00:00:57.927  -->  00:00:59.779
this H two here going on,
27

27

00:00:59.779  -->  00:01:01.844
and then at the end, this button.
28

28

00:01:01.844  -->  00:01:04.492
So let's start by formatting this section here
29

29

00:01:04.492  -->  00:01:08.754
with this gray background to color here that you see.
30

30

00:01:08.754  -->  00:01:11.609
And then of course putting the secondary heading here.
31

31

00:01:11.609  -->  00:01:14.523
And we can also start implementing the row here
32

32

00:01:14.523  -->  00:01:18.076
because you see that these are three equally sized cards.
33

33

00:01:18.076  -->  00:01:20.140
And so we're using the columns from our grid
34

34

00:01:20.140  -->  00:01:22.088
again that we coded before.
35

35

00:01:22.088  -->  00:01:25.420
So let's start by implementing these things, okay?
36

36

00:01:25.420  -->  00:01:27.170
So, back to our code.
37

37

00:01:28.754  -->  00:01:32.171
Let's start with the index dot HTML file.
38

38

00:01:34.126  -->  00:01:37.534
This one is gonna be called section tours.
39

39

00:01:37.534  -->  00:01:39.801
Once again a section element,
40

40

00:01:39.801  -->  00:01:41.748
and then with the name of section tours.
41

41

00:01:41.748  -->  00:01:43.831
So class, section, tours.
42

42

00:01:47.826  -->  00:01:49.103
Then,
43

43

00:01:49.103  -->  00:01:51.205
what we, now is the secondary heading,
44

44

00:01:51.205  -->  00:01:54.115
and I'm not going to write the code again.
45

45

00:01:54.115  -->  00:01:56.351
I'm just going here, and copy it,
46

46

00:01:56.351  -->  00:02:00.623
because it's actually the exact same thing.
47

47

00:02:00.623  -->  00:02:02.706
And so let's put it here.
48

48

00:02:03.725  -->  00:02:07.892
Once again, it has this weird formatting going on.
49

49

00:02:10.099  -->  00:02:14.266
And so, the title here should be most popular tours.
50

50

00:02:17.562  -->  00:02:20.216
And then we can also put a row with three
51

51

00:02:20.216  -->  00:02:23.020
columns in there as well.
52

52

00:02:23.020  -->  00:02:25.853
So let's just copy them from here.
53

53

00:02:26.899  -->  00:02:28.914
And, here we go.
54

54

00:02:28.914  -->  00:02:29.747
Alright.
55

55

00:02:38.207  -->  00:02:42.775
And now we can then style the section tours here.
56

56

00:02:42.775  -->  00:02:47.656
And we're gonna do that once again here in our home file.
57

57

00:02:47.656  -->  00:02:50.239
Let's get rid of that actually.
58

58

00:02:51.791  -->  00:02:53.422
And so this one is going to look
59

59

00:02:53.422  -->  00:02:55.834
a bit like the section above it.
60

60

00:02:55.834  -->  00:02:58.648
So let's actually copy the background and the padding.
61

61

00:02:58.648  -->  00:03:00.721
And we're gonna adjust this padding
62

62

00:03:00.721  -->  00:03:02.663
probably a little bit later on.
63

63

00:03:02.663  -->  00:03:06.294
But for now let's leave it at 25 pixels like this.
64

64

00:03:06.294  -->  00:03:10.454
And so let's now take a look, a first look.
65

65

00:03:10.454  -->  00:03:12.048
And so, yeah. So, here we go.
66

66

00:03:12.048  -->  00:03:13.942
Now once again we have this problem here
67

67

00:03:13.942  -->  00:03:15.236
with the wide space.
68

68

00:03:15.236  -->  00:03:18.154
So we should probably move up this entire thing here.
69

69

00:03:18.154  -->  00:03:20.559
And then let's give it some more space here, down there,
70

70

00:03:20.559  -->  00:03:23.246
just for now so we can see clearly what's going on
71

71

00:03:23.246  -->  00:03:25.575
here when we coding our cards.
72

72

00:03:25.575  -->  00:03:27.071
So we have it nicely in the middle of the page,
73

73

00:03:27.071  -->  00:03:29.683
and not here in the bottom.
74

74

00:03:29.683  -->  00:03:30.516
So,
75

75

00:03:31.716  -->  00:03:33.436
25 then at the top.
76

76

00:03:33.436  -->  00:03:34.269
Zero on the right side.
77

77

00:03:34.269  -->  00:03:39.174
Now let's say in the bottom we want, like, 50 REM, at least.
78

78

00:03:39.174  -->  00:03:41.689
And then on the left side zero as well.
79

79

00:03:41.689  -->  00:03:43.513
And then we should also move up
80

80

00:03:43.513  -->  00:03:46.270
this entire section a bit,
81

81

00:03:46.270  -->  00:03:48.871
such as we did with the section features.
82

82

00:03:48.871  -->  00:03:53.519
So let's take a look if ten REM is actually enough.
83

83

00:03:53.519  -->  00:03:54.912
And yeah, seems so.
84

84

00:03:54.912  -->  00:03:56.456
Let's just inspect.
85

85

00:03:56.456  -->  00:03:58.539
And yeah, so, here we go.
86

86

00:03:59.874  -->  00:04:02.099
So the section now goes until this point,
87

87

00:04:02.099  -->  00:04:04.864
and that's totally okay.
88

88

00:04:04.864  -->  00:04:06.260
Alright, so let's now start
89

89

00:04:06.260  -->  00:04:07.936
to implement our cards component.
90

90

00:04:07.936  -->  00:04:12.304
Because again, I'm going to define a card as a component
91

91

00:04:12.304  -->  00:04:15.978
so that we can theoretically later reuse it on the page.
92

92

00:04:15.978  -->  00:04:20.145
So let's start with the very basic functionality, alright?
93

93

00:04:21.347  -->  00:04:24.097
So, in your file, cards dot SCSS.
94

94

00:04:26.733  -->  00:04:30.233
And then, don't forget to implement a tier
95

95

00:04:34.298  -->  00:04:35.131
and card.
96

96

00:04:36.938  -->  00:04:38.188
Give it a safe.
97

97

00:04:42.470  -->  00:04:45.347
And of course you also need it in the HTML, right?
98

98

00:04:45.347  -->  00:04:47.597
And so here in this column.
99

99

00:04:50.225  -->  00:04:53.089
So once again we're not touching the column in any way.
100

100

00:04:53.089  -->  00:04:57.559
We're creating a separate DIF, just for the card.
101

101

00:04:57.559  -->  00:05:00.363
Let's just put some text here.
102

102

00:05:00.363  -->  00:05:02.944
So again, this is just for testing purposes for now.
103

103

00:05:02.944  -->  00:05:06.150
Just to implement the basic functionality.
104

104

00:05:06.150  -->  00:05:09.165
So let's start by giving it some background color, okay.
105

105

00:05:09.165  -->  00:05:10.844
Background color.
106

106

00:05:10.844  -->  00:05:11.677
Color.
107

107

00:05:12.728  -->  00:05:13.728
Orange. Red.
108

108

00:05:15.534  -->  00:05:17.729
So for testing, I really like this color.
109

109

00:05:17.729  -->  00:05:20.224
Add some height as well.
110

110

00:05:20.224  -->  00:05:21.641
Let's say 50 REM.
111

111

00:05:23.497  -->  00:05:25.459
And just for testing that should be enough.
112

112

00:05:25.459  -->  00:05:27.174
Now what actually happens when
113

113

00:05:27.174  -->  00:05:29.750
we hover the card element?
114

114

00:05:29.750  -->  00:05:31.840
Well, all it does actually is to
115

115

00:05:31.840  -->  00:05:34.452
basically rotate 180 degrees.
116

116

00:05:34.452  -->  00:05:36.586
So half of a circle, right?
117

117

00:05:36.586  -->  00:05:39.034
So a circle is 360 degrees.
118

118

00:05:39.034  -->  00:05:42.150
And so 180 degrees is half a circle.
119

119

00:05:42.150  -->  00:05:43.726
So half a rotation.
120

120

00:05:43.726  -->  00:05:46.251
Because, if you take a look here,
121

121

00:05:46.251  -->  00:05:47.719
that it what happens right.
122

122

00:05:47.719  -->  00:05:50.983
It only rotates half of a circle, basically.
123

123

00:05:50.983  -->  00:05:52.566
You see?
124

124

00:05:52.566  -->  00:05:56.320
So it's not 360 degrees. It's 180 degrees.
125

125

00:05:56.320  -->  00:05:59.488
And it rotates across the y axis, right?
126

126

00:05:59.488  -->  00:06:02.100
So remember this here is the y direction,
127

127

00:06:02.100  -->  00:06:03.099
from top to bottom.
128

128

00:06:03.099  -->  00:06:05.014
And this is the x direction.
129

129

00:06:05.014  -->  00:06:09.149
And so, the axis of this rotation is the y direction,
130

130

00:06:09.149  -->  00:06:10.531
so the y axis.
131

131

00:06:10.531  -->  00:06:12.804
And so we have to rotate y.
132

132

00:06:12.804  -->  00:06:14.804
So let's implement that.
133

133

00:06:18.093  -->  00:06:20.656
So with transform once again,
134

134

00:06:20.656  -->  00:06:21.914
and then rotate.
135

135

00:06:21.914  -->  00:06:24.381
And you see that we have these different rotates here.
136

136

00:06:24.381  -->  00:06:29.374
So according to the x axis, the y axis, and the z axis.
137

137

00:06:29.374  -->  00:06:32.080
And as I explained, I want the y axis,
138

138

00:06:32.080  -->  00:06:33.997
and I want 180 degrees.
139

139

00:06:36.065  -->  00:06:39.927
Now we of course need to give it some animation.
140

140

00:06:39.927  -->  00:06:41.094
So transition.
141

141

00:06:43.139  -->  00:06:44.066
And we'll put all here,
142

142

00:06:44.066  -->  00:06:46.912
because we're probably gonna have more later on.
143

143

00:06:46.912  -->  00:06:49.456
10.5 seconds let's say.
144

144

00:06:49.456  -->  00:06:52.375
Or we can actually more like eight point eight second,
145

145

00:06:52.375  -->  00:06:54.125
so that it takes a bit longer,
146

146

00:06:54.125  -->  00:06:57.462
and we have more time to see what's happening.
147

147

00:06:57.462  -->  00:06:59.959
So let's take a look.
148

148

00:06:59.959  -->  00:07:01.623
And it's actually already kind of working.
149

149

00:07:01.623  -->  00:07:02.706
You saw that?
150

150

00:07:04.117  -->  00:07:07.044
So it rotates and we can then see the text here,
151

151

00:07:07.044  -->  00:07:09.090
from the other side basically.
152

152

00:07:09.090  -->  00:07:10.909
So from the back you see this text here.
153

153

00:07:10.909  -->  00:07:11.796
It's inverted.
154

154

00:07:11.796  -->  00:07:15.090
Now it says starting from here, card, text.
155

155

00:07:15.090  -->  00:07:17.411
We cannot really see it really well, maybe.
156

156

00:07:17.411  -->  00:07:19.350
But that's actually what's happening.
157

157

00:07:19.350  -->  00:07:21.760
Now the effect that we have on the original
158

158

00:07:21.760  -->  00:07:22.980
looks a bit nicer, right?
159

159

00:07:22.980  -->  00:07:24.755
Let me show it.
160

160

00:07:24.755  -->  00:07:27.097
Because what happens is that it appears
161

161

00:07:27.097  -->  00:07:29.325
that it actually moves towards you, right?
162

162

00:07:29.325  -->  00:07:31.149
So it's like its coming out of the page
163

163

00:07:31.149  -->  00:07:33.960
and towards you, towards the user.
164

164

00:07:33.960  -->  00:07:35.485
You see that?
165

165

00:07:35.485  -->  00:07:37.799
And that is called perspective.
166

166

00:07:37.799  -->  00:07:38.884
So take a look at this one,
167

167

00:07:38.884  -->  00:07:40.729
and now compare it with this one.
168

168

00:07:40.729  -->  00:07:42.868
It looks completely different, right?
169

169

00:07:42.868  -->  00:07:44.378
And that is called perspective.
170

170

00:07:44.378  -->  00:07:48.581
And so in CSS, we can actually define that perspective.
171

171

00:07:48.581  -->  00:07:49.789
So let's do that.
172

172

00:07:49.789  -->  00:07:51.527
And the way we have to do it,
173

173

00:07:51.527  -->  00:07:53.534
is to actually define the perspective
174

174

00:07:53.534  -->  00:07:57.530
on the parent element of the one where the transform,
175

175

00:07:57.530  -->  00:07:58.949
where the rotation occurs.
176

176

00:07:58.949  -->  00:08:00.955
So the perspective has to be on the parent.
177

177

00:08:00.955  -->  00:08:01.928
And what that means is that
178

178

00:08:01.928  -->  00:08:04.881
we should define the perspective property in here,
179

179

00:08:04.881  -->  00:08:05.998
on the card,
180

180

00:08:05.998  -->  00:08:09.508
and then have a child element for this rotation here.
181

181

00:08:09.508  -->  00:08:13.658
So let's now first add the perspective property here.
182

182

00:08:13.658  -->  00:08:15.067
Perspective.
183

183

00:08:15.067  -->  00:08:16.334
And now in here we have to put
184

184

00:08:16.334  -->  00:08:19.377
a really huge number of pixels.
185

185

00:08:19.377  -->  00:08:21.297
So let's go with one thousand five hundred,
186

186

00:08:21.297  -->  00:08:22.853
so 1,500 pixels.
187

187

00:08:22.853  -->  00:08:24.704
So, like this.
188

188

00:08:24.704  -->  00:08:26.537
So I will put 150 REM.
189

189

00:08:27.480  -->  00:08:29.870
Now we'll show you some differences in a second.
190

190

00:08:29.870  -->  00:08:31.636
But for now, let's continue.
191

191

00:08:31.636  -->  00:08:35.237
And actually to make this work in Mozilla Firefox as well,
192

192

00:08:35.237  -->  00:08:37.737
we have to use the moz prefix.
193

193

00:08:38.721  -->  00:08:41.304
So let me add that one as well.
194

194

00:08:43.885  -->  00:08:46.785
And so now it will work in Firefox as well.
195

195

00:08:46.785  -->  00:08:50.310
So this is once again, quite a new property here.
196

196

00:08:50.310  -->  00:08:54.772
And so it's not already implemented in all of the browsers.
197

197

00:08:54.772  -->  00:08:57.441
Now remember how we had to now put
198

198

00:08:57.441  -->  00:09:01.560
these properties here on a child element of the card?
199

199

00:09:01.560  -->  00:09:04.113
So let's actually do that.
200

200

00:09:04.113  -->  00:09:06.139
So you want a new DIF here.
201

201

00:09:06.139  -->  00:09:08.395
And I'm calling it the card side,
202

202

00:09:08.395  -->  00:09:09.681
because it's one side of the card.
203

203

00:09:09.681  -->  00:09:13.550
And later we will then add another side.
204

204

00:09:13.550  -->  00:09:15.384
So just text here.
205

205

00:09:15.384  -->  00:09:16.824
So, again this is the block,
206

206

00:09:16.824  -->  00:09:20.798
and then this is the element in the BEM notation.
207

207

00:09:20.798  -->  00:09:21.965
So, card side.
208

208

00:09:24.563  -->  00:09:26.158
Here it is.
209

209

00:09:26.158  -->  00:09:27.477
Let's actually close this one.
210

210

00:09:27.477  -->  00:09:29.060
We're done with it.
211

211

00:09:30.484  -->  00:09:31.317
And so,
212

212

00:09:32.715  -->  00:09:33.548
card side.
213

213

00:09:37.367  -->  00:09:38.200
Alright.
214

214

00:09:41.969  -->  00:09:44.511
Now this here also has to change of course.
215

215

00:09:44.511  -->  00:09:46.189
So the way we're gonna do that,
216

216

00:09:46.189  -->  00:09:48.475
is to say that when we hover the card,
217

217

00:09:48.475  -->  00:09:51.392
then we want the side to transform.
218

218

00:09:53.768  -->  00:09:54.906
Does that make sense?
219

219

00:09:54.906  -->  00:09:59.073
Let me write it out to you again so it makes more sense.
220

220

00:10:00.475  -->  00:10:02.395
So we hover the card, right?
221

221

00:10:02.395  -->  00:10:04.876
And when the card is hovered,
222

222

00:10:04.876  -->  00:10:08.126
then the card side will be transformed.
223

223

00:10:09.499  -->  00:10:13.639
And we do not put the hover here directly on the card side
224

224

00:10:13.639  -->  00:10:15.787
because later we will have more sides.
225

225

00:10:15.787  -->  00:10:16.929
And actually it makes more sense
226

226

00:10:16.929  -->  00:10:18.321
that we really want to hover,
227

227

00:10:18.321  -->  00:10:19.944
we want this effect to occur
228

228

00:10:19.944  -->  00:10:22.065
when we hover the main components.
229

229

00:10:22.065  -->  00:10:23.592
So the main block.
230

230

00:10:23.592  -->  00:10:25.072
So when we hover the card,
231

231

00:10:25.072  -->  00:10:28.737
that's when our effect starts taking place.
232

232

00:10:28.737  -->  00:10:31.147
So let's now take a look.
233

233

00:10:31.147  -->  00:10:33.145
Let's actually make the text a bit bigger here,
234

234

00:10:33.145  -->  00:10:36.811
just now for testing purposes again.
235

235

00:10:36.811  -->  00:10:37.894
Color. White.
236

236

00:10:39.134  -->  00:10:40.065
I'm just gonna write it like this
237

237

00:10:40.065  -->  00:10:43.338
because I will delete it in a second.
238

238

00:10:43.338  -->  00:10:45.171
And font size two REM.
239

239

00:10:48.779  -->  00:10:50.980
And so now let's hover it.
240

240

00:10:50.980  -->  00:10:51.813
And, yeah.
241

241

00:10:51.813  -->  00:10:54.756
So, that looks much nicer, right?
242

242

00:10:54.756  -->  00:10:56.205
You see, now it also looks
243

243

00:10:56.205  -->  00:10:59.755
as if it was moving towards you already.
244

244

00:10:59.755  -->  00:11:02.529
So, that's much better than it was before.
245

245

00:11:02.529  -->  00:11:06.561
Now I wanted to show you how it looks like
246

246

00:11:06.561  -->  00:11:08.577
with different values of perspective.
247

247

00:11:08.577  -->  00:11:10.520
So let's come here to the parent element,
248

248

00:11:10.520  -->  00:11:11.707
and change that.
249

249

00:11:11.707  -->  00:11:12.794
For example,
250

250

00:11:12.794  -->  00:11:15.377
imagine we only had put 15 REM.
251

251

00:11:17.070  -->  00:11:20.708
Then it would be this crazy effect.
252

252

00:11:20.708  -->  00:11:22.958
Whoa. What's going on here?
253

253

00:11:23.930  -->  00:11:25.905
So it's not really clear how these
254

254

00:11:25.905  -->  00:11:27.811
values here affect our perspective.
255

255

00:11:27.811  -->  00:11:29.788
But basically, the lower the value,
256

256

00:11:29.788  -->  00:11:32.688
the more dramatic the perspective is.
257

257

00:11:32.688  -->  00:11:35.731
So let's put a really high number here right now.
258

258

00:11:35.731  -->  00:11:38.620
And so now it looks almost as we had it in the beginning.
259

259

00:11:38.620  -->  00:11:42.599
So we don't see any perspective effect at all.
260

260

00:11:42.599  -->  00:11:45.091
And so this is, kind of a bit of experimentation
261

261

00:11:45.091  -->  00:11:46.429
until you get it right.
262

262

00:11:46.429  -->  00:11:50.380
Until you get the look that you want for it.
263

263

00:11:50.380  -->  00:11:53.445
So we now have implemented this side of the card.
264

264

00:11:53.445  -->  00:11:56.208
But actually we have two sides, right?
265

265

00:11:56.208  -->  00:11:59.127
So again, you can see that we see the back part
266

266

00:11:59.127  -->  00:12:01.267
of this card now here because the text
267

267

00:12:01.267  -->  00:12:02.591
is now the other way around.
268

268

00:12:02.591  -->  00:12:05.357
So basically we're seeing the card now from behind.
269

269

00:12:05.357  -->  00:12:07.281
But that's not really what we want.
270

270

00:12:07.281  -->  00:12:08.764
So what we have here is that basically
271

271

00:12:08.764  -->  00:12:11.694
we see one card side in the beginning,
272

272

00:12:11.694  -->  00:12:14.842
and then we hover it, we see the other card side.
273

273

00:12:14.842  -->  00:12:18.797
So let's now implement that in our HTML TSS.
274

274

00:12:18.797  -->  00:12:21.214
So we have another card side.
275

275

00:12:26.783  -->  00:12:29.533
So let's put here front and back.
276

276

00:12:32.745  -->  00:12:35.052
And so now we need a way to distinguish them.
277

277

00:12:35.052  -->  00:12:35.943
And so what I'm gonna do
278

278

00:12:35.943  -->  00:12:37.796
is to add a mode file.
279

279

00:12:37.796  -->  00:12:38.879
So card side,
280

280

00:12:41.041  -->  00:12:41.874
front.
281

281

00:12:42.999  -->  00:12:44.999
And then card side back.
282

282

00:12:47.970  -->  00:12:49.301
Alright.
283

283

00:12:49.301  -->  00:12:51.893
So now we have a front side and a back side.
284

284

00:12:51.893  -->  00:12:52.893
Very simple.
285

285

00:12:57.787  -->  00:13:00.370
So front side, and a back side.
286

286

00:13:05.995  -->  00:13:10.162
So let's actually give each one a different color here.
287

287

00:13:14.530  -->  00:13:19.237
And this one is gonna be just green, let's say.
288

288

00:13:19.237  -->  00:13:21.126
Now think about what does it mean
289

289

00:13:21.126  -->  00:13:23.567
that this side here is the back side?
290

290

00:13:23.567  -->  00:13:24.658
So what's the different between
291

291

00:13:24.658  -->  00:13:27.358
this back side and the front side?
292

292

00:13:27.358  -->  00:13:28.930
Can you imagine that?
293

293

00:13:28.930  -->  00:13:30.398
Well, the difference is,
294

294

00:13:30.398  -->  00:13:31.689
is that the back side,
295

295

00:13:31.689  -->  00:13:34.375
in the beginning has already rotated.
296

296

00:13:34.375  -->  00:13:37.589
So it's already 180 degrees on the back.
297

297

00:13:37.589  -->  00:13:40.469
And then as soon as we hover the card,
298

298

00:13:40.469  -->  00:13:42.133
then it moves to zero.
299

299

00:13:42.133  -->  00:13:44.426
Does that make sense?
300

300

00:13:44.426  -->  00:13:48.638
So let me implement that and show it to you.
301

301

00:13:48.638  -->  00:13:50.435
So before we hover the card,
302

302

00:13:50.435  -->  00:13:53.905
this backside is already flipped basically, right?
303

303

00:13:53.905  -->  00:13:56.372
So it's already at 180 degrees.
304

304

00:13:56.372  -->  00:13:59.778
And so now we have to change this hover thing here as well.
305

305

00:13:59.778  -->  00:14:04.318
Because only the front side is what rotates the 180 degrees.
306

306

00:14:04.318  -->  00:14:08.318
Because the back side is already at 180 degrees.
307

307

00:14:09.454  -->  00:14:12.913
So this only applies to the front side.
308

308

00:14:12.913  -->  00:14:15.996
And what does apply to the back side?
309

309

00:14:17.674  -->  00:14:20.226
Well, if it's already at 180,
310

310

00:14:20.226  -->  00:14:23.287
it now needs to go back to zero.
311

311

00:14:23.287  -->  00:14:25.844
And that's actually it.
312

312

00:14:25.844  -->  00:14:26.967
So let's test it out,
313

313

00:14:26.967  -->  00:14:29.546
and then take a look at the code again, if we understand it.
314

314

00:14:29.546  -->  00:14:32.322
So this is what it looks like right now,
315

315

00:14:32.322  -->  00:14:35.556
well not exactly as we imagined it, right?
316

316

00:14:35.556  -->  00:14:37.284
But we're getting there.
317

317

00:14:37.284  -->  00:14:39.645
So you see that this one is now flipped,
318

318

00:14:39.645  -->  00:14:42.680
and this one is at the front.
319

319

00:14:42.680  -->  00:14:45.086
And when we leave it, this one is on the front,
320

320

00:14:45.086  -->  00:14:46.663
and the other one is on the back.
321

321

00:14:46.663  -->  00:14:49.524
And you can see that because the text starts from the
322

322

00:14:49.524  -->  00:14:51.148
right hand side on the back part.
323

323

00:14:51.148  -->  00:14:54.141
Now in order to finally create this effect
324

324

00:14:54.141  -->  00:14:55.848
that we have in our final version,
325

325

00:14:55.848  -->  00:14:59.076
they need to be on top of one another.
326

326

00:14:59.076  -->  00:15:00.996
And so how can we do that?
327

327

00:15:00.996  -->  00:15:03.847
Well, we simply use absolute positioning.
328

328

00:15:03.847  -->  00:15:05.767
And we do that on both of them.
329

329

00:15:05.767  -->  00:15:09.061
And so, we can do it right here in the card side class,
330

330

00:15:09.061  -->  00:15:12.555
because that's the one that's coming to both of them.
331

331

00:15:12.555  -->  00:15:14.388
So, position absolute.
332

332

00:15:15.617  -->  00:15:18.266
And we simply want them to start,
333

333

00:15:18.266  -->  00:15:19.812
at the top, so top zero,
334

334

00:15:19.812  -->  00:15:23.249
and at the left, so left zero as well.
335

335

00:15:23.249  -->  00:15:24.534
Now remember, we always have to
336

336

00:15:24.534  -->  00:15:27.534
give the parent a relative position.
337

337

00:15:29.365  -->  00:15:30.365
So position,
338

338

00:15:31.563  -->  00:15:32.695
relative.
339

339

00:15:32.695  -->  00:15:35.528
And now we should be almost there.
340

340

00:15:37.994  -->  00:15:40.337
Now since we gave them an absolute position,
341

341

00:15:40.337  -->  00:15:41.760
what the elements do is that
342

342

00:15:41.760  -->  00:15:44.456
they basically start fitting to their width.
343

343

00:15:44.456  -->  00:15:46.654
So you see, this one is now,
344

344

00:15:46.654  -->  00:15:48.844
the red one is wider than the green one
345

345

00:15:48.844  -->  00:15:51.320
because it says front and the front text
346

346

00:15:51.320  -->  00:15:53.737
is wider than just back text.
347

347

00:15:55.547  -->  00:15:57.947
And so we need to change that as well.
348

348

00:15:57.947  -->  00:16:01.280
So let's give them a width of 100%.
349

349

00:16:03.833  -->  00:16:07.745
And the final piece of the puzzle is another property
350

350

00:16:07.745  -->  00:16:09.182
that I actually showed you before.
351

351

00:16:09.182  -->  00:16:11.573
But that was just to fix a weird animation error.
352

352

00:16:11.573  -->  00:16:13.849
But this time we really need this property.
353

353

00:16:13.849  -->  00:16:18.486
And the one I'm talking about is called backface-visibility.
354

354

00:16:18.486  -->  00:16:20.818
Remember me talking about this one?
355

355

00:16:20.818  -->  00:16:24.200
Well, what this does is that, if we set it to hidden,
356

356

00:16:24.200  -->  00:16:27.810
it basically hides the back part of an element.
357

357

00:16:27.810  -->  00:16:29.841
So you saw that when we rotated the card
358

358

00:16:29.841  -->  00:16:33.105
where it said front, it then, as soon as we rotated it,
359

359

00:16:33.105  -->  00:16:35.066
that text started from the right side,
360

360

00:16:35.066  -->  00:16:37.267
until we were seeing the card from the back side.
361

361

00:16:37.267  -->  00:16:40.277
And so now when we specify this backface-visibility
362

362

00:16:40.277  -->  00:16:43.465
to hidden we will no longer be able to see that back part.
363

363

00:16:43.465  -->  00:16:46.661
And that's actually exactly what we want, right?
364

364

00:16:46.661  -->  00:16:48.911
So let me check that again.
365

365

00:16:51.854  -->  00:16:53.036
And so here we go.
366

366

00:16:53.036  -->  00:16:56.012
Well, actually the perspective is kind of gone.
367

367

00:16:56.012  -->  00:16:59.179
Let me check out what's going on here.
368

368

00:17:01.753  -->  00:17:04.406
And okay, okay, I see what's going on here.
369

369

00:17:04.406  -->  00:17:05.239
You see that?
370

370

00:17:05.239  -->  00:17:09.488
So this card, it has no height anymore right now.
371

371

00:17:09.488  -->  00:17:12.223
So the cards, they have a height of 500 pixels,
372

372

00:17:12.223  -->  00:17:16.669
as we defined, but the card does no longer have a height.
373

373

00:17:16.669  -->  00:17:17.783
And why is that?
374

374

00:17:17.783  -->  00:17:20.038
Well it is because its height collapsed.
375

375

00:17:20.038  -->  00:17:21.479
And that's very similar to what happens
376

376

00:17:21.479  -->  00:17:23.659
when all of the elements are flooded.
377

377

00:17:23.659  -->  00:17:27.506
But right now, all the elements are on position absolute.
378

378

00:17:27.506  -->  00:17:30.157
And so they're also taken out of the natural flow.
379

379

00:17:30.157  -->  00:17:31.933
Remember when we talked about that?
380

380

00:17:31.933  -->  00:17:34.871
So, we took these cards out of their natural flow.
381

381

00:17:34.871  -->  00:17:38.617
And therefore the parent collapsed and lost its height.
382

382

00:17:38.617  -->  00:17:41.315
Now when this happens with floats, we have a clear fix.
383

383

00:17:41.315  -->  00:17:42.785
But with position absolute,
384

384

00:17:42.785  -->  00:17:44.556
there is actually no such thing.
385

385

00:17:44.556  -->  00:17:48.368
There is nothing we can do, at least not with pure CSS.
386

386

00:17:48.368  -->  00:17:49.960
And so what we have to do,
387

387

00:17:49.960  -->  00:17:52.187
is to actually specify the same height
388

388

00:17:52.187  -->  00:17:55.220
that we gave to the card itself.
389

389

00:17:55.220  -->  00:17:57.256
And so now we're saying that height
390

390

00:17:57.256  -->  00:18:01.231
of the card should be 50, and of the sides as well.
391

391

00:18:01.231  -->  00:18:03.976
And so they can have the same height.
392

392

00:18:03.976  -->  00:18:07.211
And with that, our perspective should be back.
393

393

00:18:07.211  -->  00:18:08.544
And here you go.
394

394

00:18:09.679  -->  00:18:11.887
So that's exactly the way
395

395

00:18:11.887  -->  00:18:13.883
that the other animation looks like, right?
396

396

00:18:13.883  -->  00:18:14.767
Well, not exactly.
397

397

00:18:14.767  -->  00:18:18.800
It's because we can also use another animation type.
398

398

00:18:18.800  -->  00:18:20.113
Because,
399

399

00:18:20.113  -->  00:18:21.102
well,
400

400

00:18:21.102  -->  00:18:22.479
so we have the transition here.
401

401

00:18:22.479  -->  00:18:23.614
Remember there is something called
402

402

00:18:23.614  -->  00:18:25.614
the transition timing function.
403

403

00:18:25.614  -->  00:18:27.250
And when we don't specify it,
404

404

00:18:27.250  -->  00:18:29.186
then it simply uses the most simple one,
405

405

00:18:29.186  -->  00:18:30.834
which is a linear animation.
406

406

00:18:30.834  -->  00:18:31.950
But we don't want that.
407

407

00:18:31.950  -->  00:18:33.477
We want ease.
408

408

00:18:33.477  -->  00:18:35.378
And so this animation looks a bit smoother.
409

409

00:18:35.378  -->  00:18:37.384
And again, I'm gonna explain better to you
410

410

00:18:37.384  -->  00:18:40.024
what these transition timing functions really mean,
411

411

00:18:40.024  -->  00:18:41.467
how they really work.
412

412

00:18:41.467  -->  00:18:43.432
And I will show you a lot of examples as well.
413

413

00:18:43.432  -->  00:18:45.668
For now, let's just use this.
414

414

00:18:45.668  -->  00:18:49.634
And so with that, our animation should look a bit better.
415

415

00:18:49.634  -->  00:18:52.801
Now we can also get rid now of
416

416

00:18:52.801  -->  00:18:56.191
these weird background colors here as well.
417

417

00:18:56.191  -->  00:18:59.021
Here we can actually put background color.
418

418

00:18:59.021  -->  00:19:00.663
And it should be white.
419

419

00:19:00.663  -->  00:19:01.996
So, color white.
420

420

00:19:04.695  -->  00:19:08.862
And then here on the back, let's take a look at our example.
421

421

00:19:12.174  -->  00:19:16.007
Okay, so now this looks a bit better, in fact.
422

422

00:19:17.550  -->  00:19:20.507
And so let's take a look here at this one.
423

423

00:19:20.507  -->  00:19:21.524
And so you see that in here,
424

424

00:19:21.524  -->  00:19:23.089
we have this nice gradient going on
425

425

00:19:23.089  -->  00:19:25.162
from this corner to this one.
426

426

00:19:25.162  -->  00:19:27.055
And these are actually some new colors
427

427

00:19:27.055  -->  00:19:29.314
that we have to add to our color palat.
428

428

00:19:29.314  -->  00:19:32.113
So this yellow and this orange here.
429

429

00:19:32.113  -->  00:19:33.806
And then also these two colors here.
430

430

00:19:33.806  -->  00:19:37.029
So this blue and this, like, dark blue or pink.
431

431

00:19:37.029  -->  00:19:38.778
So we have these new colors here.
432

432

00:19:38.778  -->  00:19:41.265
And this is just a normal green gradient here in the middle.
433

433

00:19:41.265  -->  00:19:42.778
But the other ones we have to add.
434

434

00:19:42.778  -->  00:19:45.777
So let's put them into our variables file.
435

435

00:19:45.777  -->  00:19:48.004
And let's put them right here.
436

436

00:19:48.004  -->  00:19:52.087
So I'm calling the first one the color secondary.
437

437

00:19:53.738  -->  00:19:55.215
And then light.
438

438

00:19:55.215  -->  00:19:57.526
So it's a light version first.
439

439

00:19:57.526  -->  00:20:01.109
And the color here is ffb nine, zero, zero.
440

440

00:20:03.822  -->  00:20:06.789
So I'm missing the hash here.
441

441

00:20:06.789  -->  00:20:11.377
So I got all of these colors here by getting some
442

442

00:20:11.377  -->  00:20:14.363
inspiration from other websites and other web apps.
443

443

00:20:14.363  -->  00:20:17.370
And if you also want to get some inspiration,
444

444

00:20:17.370  -->  00:20:18.462
see some examples,
445

445

00:20:18.462  -->  00:20:21.045
they have a lot of websites where you can do that.
446

446

00:20:21.045  -->  00:20:23.666
And you can find them on my resources page.
447

447

00:20:23.666  -->  00:20:25.605
So I have a couple of links.
448

448

00:20:25.605  -->  00:20:27.851
There are multiple sites out there
449

449

00:20:27.851  -->  00:20:30.434
where you can find inspiration.
450

450

00:20:32.958  -->  00:20:34.407
And that's something that's really important
451

451

00:20:34.407  -->  00:20:37.048
as a web developer, and also web designer,
452

452

00:20:37.048  -->  00:20:39.870
so, I consider myself, that I'm both,
453

453

00:20:39.870  -->  00:20:43.565
and so I like to be on top of that.
454

454

00:20:43.565  -->  00:20:46.132
So the latest design trends.
455

455

00:20:46.132  -->  00:20:47.838
So that I can keep up with industry
456

456

00:20:47.838  -->  00:20:52.005
and then use these trends as well in my own designs.
457

457

00:20:53.511  -->  00:20:55.928
So, this is now the tertiary.
458

458

00:20:57.956  -->  00:21:01.321
So, put these colors here in your variables file
459

459

00:21:01.321  -->  00:21:04.590
so that we can now use them here in the card.
460

460

00:21:04.590  -->  00:21:07.856
So we have three cards and three gradients going on.
461

461

00:21:07.856  -->  00:21:09.295
So what does that mean?
462

462

00:21:09.295  -->  00:21:10.681
Well, it means that we actually
463

463

00:21:10.681  -->  00:21:12.955
need a new modifier here, right?
464

464

00:21:12.955  -->  00:21:16.122
Because we have three card side backs.
465

465

00:21:17.035  -->  00:21:20.088
So it's getting a bit more complicated.
466

466

00:21:20.088  -->  00:21:21.697
And we have more and more code.
467

467

00:21:21.697  -->  00:21:23.445
But, well, that's just how it works.
468

468

00:21:23.445  -->  00:21:25.489
This is a really complex component.
469

469

00:21:25.489  -->  00:21:28.989
So now we can specify the back in general,
470

470

00:21:30.162  -->  00:21:32.307
and then we will have some very specific code
471

471

00:21:32.307  -->  00:21:35.474
for each of the three different cards.
472

472

00:21:36.557  -->  00:21:38.726
So, let's do that.
473

473

00:21:38.726  -->  00:21:39.559
So, back.
474

474

00:21:42.030  -->  00:21:44.219
And then the number one.
475

475

00:21:44.219  -->  00:21:48.136
And then of course we will have some for the next two cards.
476

476

00:21:48.136  -->  00:21:48.969
So,
477

477

00:21:48.969  -->  00:21:51.302
no background color in here.
478

478

00:21:52.436  -->  00:21:55.356
And here we have a linear gradient.
479

479

00:21:55.356  -->  00:21:58.856
So background color, then linear gradient.
480

480

00:22:02.669  -->  00:22:05.836
So it goes to the right bottom corner.
481

481

00:22:07.354  -->  00:22:11.420
So right bottom, and then the colors that we want.
482

482

00:22:11.420  -->  00:22:13.003
So color secondary,
483

483

00:22:16.398  -->  00:22:19.065
light, and color secondary dark.
484

484

00:22:27.427  -->  00:22:29.427
So let's check that out.
485

485

00:22:32.248  -->  00:22:34.748
Well, that didn't really work.
486

486

00:22:35.886  -->  00:22:36.719
Sorry.
487

487

00:22:36.719  -->  00:22:39.066
Let me check out why that happened.
488

488

00:22:39.066  -->  00:22:40.966
Ah, actually, it's not background color.
489

489

00:22:40.966  -->  00:22:43.479
It is background image.
490

490

00:22:43.479  -->  00:22:47.646
So for linear gradient, it's image not color, of course.
491

491

00:22:50.597  -->  00:22:53.204
Well, let me reload it again.
492

492

00:22:53.204  -->  00:22:56.191
And let me now take a look, inspect.
493

493

00:22:56.191  -->  00:22:57.024
Well,
494

494

00:23:00.762  -->  00:23:02.621
it still has this green color here.
495

495

00:23:02.621  -->  00:23:04.071
So maybe there was again,
496

496

00:23:04.071  -->  00:23:06.571
an error with the calculation.
497

497

00:23:08.728  -->  00:23:10.803
And yeah, okay, so what it says here
498

498

00:23:10.803  -->  00:23:12.493
is that I have an undefined variable,
499

499

00:23:12.493  -->  00:23:14.468
color secondary dark.
500

500

00:23:14.468  -->  00:23:15.718
Light and dark.
501

501

00:23:16.935  -->  00:23:20.957
Well let me check out the light and dark.
502

502

00:23:20.957  -->  00:23:21.790
Ah, okay.
503

503

00:23:23.741  -->  00:23:26.346
Of course, I need to change this.
504

504

00:23:26.346  -->  00:23:29.626
So we have the light and the dark one for both.
505

505

00:23:29.626  -->  00:23:33.809
Probably you had already noticed this error.
506

506

00:23:33.809  -->  00:23:34.886
I just did not.
507

507

00:23:34.886  -->  00:23:36.763
So sorry about that.
508

508

00:23:36.763  -->  00:23:40.096
And so, yeah, that looks amazing, right?
509

509

00:23:41.046  -->  00:23:44.771
Now just as the finishing touches of this card
510

510

00:23:44.771  -->  00:23:47.852
let's give it these rounded corners here that we see,
511

511

00:23:47.852  -->  00:23:51.146
and also the, this very subtle shadow that you
512

512

00:23:51.146  -->  00:23:53.146
see underneath the card.
513

513

00:23:55.751  -->  00:23:56.584
So,
514

514

00:23:57.971  -->  00:23:59.054
border radius
515

515

00:24:01.429  -->  00:24:03.619
of three pixels let's say.
516

516

00:24:03.619  -->  00:24:06.668
And then a nice box shadow.
517

517

00:24:06.668  -->  00:24:09.168
So zero in the x direction,
518

518

00:24:10.729  -->  00:24:12.515
one point five REM in here,
519

519

00:24:12.515  -->  00:24:14.182
then 40 pixels blur.
520

520

00:24:15.241  -->  00:24:16.115
So four REM.
521

521

00:24:16.115  -->  00:24:20.282
And then for the color, RGBA, that's always, color black.
522

522

00:24:23.930  -->  00:24:26.097
This time with a 15%.
523

523

00:24:27.029  -->  00:24:30.150
Now you see that we also repeating these
524

524

00:24:30.150  -->  00:24:32.046
kind of shadows here all the time.
525

525

00:24:32.046  -->  00:24:36.033
So, we could also do a variable for all of these shadows.
526

526

00:24:36.033  -->  00:24:37.968
But again, I'm not gonna go crazy here now
527

527

00:24:37.968  -->  00:24:39.975
and define a variable for everything.
528

528

00:24:39.975  -->  00:24:40.994
But in fact you can do it,
529

529

00:24:40.994  -->  00:24:42.354
and probably you should do it
530

530

00:24:42.354  -->  00:24:44.314
just to test it out for yourself.
531

531

00:24:44.314  -->  00:24:47.570
And so I think that would be a good idea for you.
532

532

00:24:47.570  -->  00:24:49.915
So find all of the shadows that are the same,
533

533

00:24:49.915  -->  00:24:51.420
or at least similar,
534

534

00:24:51.420  -->  00:24:53.133
and then make a couple of variables like,
535

535

00:24:53.133  -->  00:24:55.696
shadow one, shadow two, and shadow three.
536

536

00:24:55.696  -->  00:24:58.433
And then you can simply add these here
537

537

00:24:58.433  -->  00:25:00.683
in the box shadow property.
538

538

00:25:01.812  -->  00:25:02.645
Alright.
539

539

00:25:04.806  -->  00:25:07.024
Ah yeah, that looks better right?
540

540

00:25:07.024  -->  00:25:09.702
And so that is the basic functionality of the cards.
541

541

00:25:09.702  -->  00:25:10.535
Now in the next lecture,
542

542

00:25:10.535  -->  00:25:12.486
we're actually gonna start styling it,
543

543

00:25:12.486  -->  00:25:15.434
and so we're gonna take care of that image you see up there,
544

544

00:25:15.434  -->  00:25:17.748
then this nice orange text box that you have there,
545

545

00:25:17.748  -->  00:25:20.061
which is slightly overlapping the white part.
546

546

00:25:20.061  -->  00:25:21.924
And so, yeah, looking forward to do
547

547

00:25:21.924  -->  00:25:24.007
that in the next lecture.
