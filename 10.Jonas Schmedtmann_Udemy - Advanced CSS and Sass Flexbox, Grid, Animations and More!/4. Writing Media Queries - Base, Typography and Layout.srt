00:00:01,417  -->  00:00:02,775
<v Jonas>Welcome back.</v>
2

2

00:00:02,775  -->  00:00:05,324
Now that we have a working media query manager
3

3

00:00:05,324  -->  00:00:06,989
that we did in the last lecture,
4

4

00:00:06,989  -->  00:00:08,668
let's now finally start using it
5

5

00:00:08,668  -->  00:00:12,585
and write some real media queries for our page.
6

6

00:00:13,432  -->  00:00:15,029
But before we start doing that,
7

7

00:00:15,029  -->  00:00:16,324
I wanna actually take a minute
8

8

00:00:16,324  -->  00:00:17,781
and come back to the order
9

9

00:00:17,781  -->  00:00:20,568
of the media queries that we write here.
10

10

00:00:20,568  -->  00:00:22,405
I wanna recap on why this is the order
11

11

00:00:22,405  -->  00:00:24,899
and not the other way around,
12

12

00:00:24,899  -->  00:00:26,368
because this is really essential
13

13

00:00:26,368  -->  00:00:29,851
in understanding responsive web design.
14

14

00:00:29,851  -->  00:00:34,018
Imagine that we have a width of 700 pixels for the screen.
15

15

00:00:35,245  -->  00:00:36,624
In this case, of course,
16

16

00:00:36,624  -->  00:00:39,433
both of these media queries will apply.
17

17

00:00:39,433  -->  00:00:43,516
So 700 is less than 1,200 and also less than 900.
18

18

00:00:44,690  -->  00:00:46,032
And what happens then?
19

19

00:00:46,032  -->  00:00:48,566
Well, since both of the media queries apply,
20

20

00:00:48,566  -->  00:00:51,722
it will simply be the last declaration that is applied.
21

21

00:00:51,722  -->  00:00:54,993
So both of these have a font-size declaration, right?
22

22

00:00:54,993  -->  00:00:56,428
So the last one of these two
23

23

00:00:56,428  -->  00:00:59,164
is the one that will be applied, so 50%.
24

24

00:00:59,164  -->  00:01:00,831
And that is, of course, the one we want
25

25

00:01:00,831  -->  00:01:04,764
because 900 is the one that's closer to this 700.
26

26

00:01:04,764  -->  00:01:08,525
If it was the other way around, like this,
27

27

00:01:08,525  -->  00:01:11,227
then at this screen size of 700,
28

28

00:01:11,227  -->  00:01:13,839
we would have the font size of 56%,
29

29

00:01:13,839  -->  00:01:15,489
which was actually only supposed to be used
30

30

00:01:15,489  -->  00:01:18,406
in the range between 900 and 1,200.
31

31

00:01:19,273  -->  00:01:21,373
So if we did it like this, this would mess up
32

32

00:01:21,373  -->  00:01:25,540
our entire code, our entire structure of our media queries.
33

33

00:01:26,980  -->  00:01:30,661
So this is the way that we want it.
34

34

00:01:30,661  -->  00:01:33,136
Now, if you happen to be writing a mobile-first website,
35

35

00:01:33,136  -->  00:01:35,613
then it's the complete other way around.
36

36

00:01:35,613  -->  00:01:38,375
In that case, we have to start with the lower width
37

37

00:01:38,375  -->  00:01:39,898
and move up to the larger width
38

38

00:01:39,898  -->  00:01:41,788
because everything is the other way around.
39

39

00:01:41,788  -->  00:01:43,578
We have min-width media queries.
40

40

00:01:43,578  -->  00:01:47,106
So then, in that case, we also need to change the order,
41

41

00:01:47,106  -->  00:01:49,332
starting with the lower ones and then move on
42

42

00:01:49,332  -->  00:01:51,499
to the larger screen size.
43

43

00:01:52,589  -->  00:01:54,337
Now that we have that out of the way,
44

44

00:01:54,337  -->  00:01:56,943
let's move on and start writing our media queries.
45

45

00:01:56,943  -->  00:02:00,199
This is the order in which I like to do it.
46

46

00:02:00,199  -->  00:02:02,515
Let me actually write it down for you.
47

47

00:02:02,515  -->  00:02:05,868
I will do it here in this mix-in.
48

48

00:02:05,868  -->  00:02:08,331
The order in which I like to do this
49

49

00:02:08,331  -->  00:02:12,081
is to start with the base and the typography,
50

50

00:02:13,070  -->  00:02:15,052
then moving on to the more general layout,
51

51

00:02:15,052  -->  00:02:17,570
like header, footer, navigation and all that stuff.
52

52

00:02:17,570  -->  00:02:20,653
So general layout, and also the grid.
53

53

00:02:21,985  -->  00:02:24,211
The grid also needs to be changed.
54

54

00:02:24,211  -->  00:02:27,061
Then the the more specific page layout.
55

55

00:02:27,061  -->  00:02:30,144
Then finally changing the components.
56

56

00:02:32,395  -->  00:02:35,084
In this lecture, we will take care of this part.
57

57

00:02:35,084  -->  00:02:37,199
We're gonna change some stuff in the base,
58

58

00:02:37,199  -->  00:02:39,727
in the typography, general layout and grid.
59

59

00:02:39,727  -->  00:02:41,611
Actually, we don't need that many changes
60

60

00:02:41,611  -->  00:02:45,599
because once again, this overall font-size here
61

61

00:02:45,599  -->  00:02:47,135
takes care of most of the changes
62

62

00:02:47,135  -->  00:02:49,603
that we want to make, actually.
63

63

00:02:49,603  -->  00:02:52,640
Adjustments that we need to do are pretty minor
64

64

00:02:52,640  -->  00:02:54,951
in most of the cases.
65

65

00:02:54,951  -->  00:02:58,118
Let's fire up our typography file here
66

66

00:02:59,107  -->  00:03:01,343
and then close all of this here.
67

67

00:03:01,343  -->  00:03:03,967
And I'll take a look at our webpage.
68

68

00:03:03,967  -->  00:03:07,919
This is it, still here in the device menu.
69

69

00:03:07,919  -->  00:03:09,382
Notice something really cool that we can do
70

70

00:03:09,382  -->  00:03:11,244
what I didn't show you in the last lecture,
71

71

00:03:11,244  -->  00:03:14,939
which is to show actually our media queries.
72

72

00:03:14,939  -->  00:03:18,856
These are our media queries, these ranges here.
73

73

00:03:19,852  -->  00:03:22,815
56.25 is the smallest one.
74

74

00:03:22,815  -->  00:03:24,806
Let me check that out for you.
75

75

00:03:24,806  -->  00:03:26,351
Where is this mix-in?
76

76

00:03:26,351  -->  00:03:27,518
56.25 is here.
77

77

00:03:31,978  -->  00:03:34,811
Let me zoom that out a bit, so 75.
78

78

00:03:38,855  -->  00:03:42,970
So in here we are now in the 56.25 media queries.
79

79

00:03:42,970  -->  00:03:45,131
Actually we have a smaller one, which is this one.
80

80

00:03:45,131  -->  00:03:47,364
But we don't really have one on the page
81

81

00:03:47,364  -->  00:03:48,573
at this point already
82

82

00:03:48,573  -->  00:03:51,706
because the only three media queries that we wrote
83

83

00:03:51,706  -->  00:03:53,281
were the three here.
84

84

00:03:53,281  -->  00:03:55,362
And the one for the phone is not here.
85

85

00:03:55,362  -->  00:03:57,999
So dev tools of course cannot know
86

86

00:03:57,999  -->  00:04:00,365
that we actually plan for one for the phone.
87

87

00:04:00,365  -->  00:04:03,658
So it's gonna come up here later.
88

88

00:04:03,658  -->  00:04:08,417
But anyway, this one here is our break point at 900 pixels,
89

89

00:04:08,417  -->  00:04:10,168
as you can see in here.
90

90

00:04:10,168  -->  00:04:13,094
Then you can also nicely see which one is applying.
91

91

00:04:13,094  -->  00:04:16,289
When they become darker means that they are applied.
92

92

00:04:16,289  -->  00:04:17,392
Then you have this one here as well,
93

93

00:04:17,392  -->  00:04:18,948
and all you need to do is to click here
94

94

00:04:18,948  -->  00:04:21,531
and it goes to the break point.
95

95

00:04:23,547  -->  00:04:25,144
Also you see here that the blue ones
96

96

00:04:25,144  -->  00:04:27,769
are the max-width media queries.
97

97

00:04:27,769  -->  00:04:31,257
Then here the orange ones are the min-width.
98

98

00:04:31,257  -->  00:04:36,107
Google Chrome also does this nice distinction here for us.
99

99

00:04:36,107  -->  00:04:38,998
Then up here, we have simply the responsive way
100

100

00:04:38,998  -->  00:04:43,252
where we can decrease and increase our screen here
101

101

00:04:43,252  -->  00:04:45,025
as we wish, as I showed you.
102

102

00:04:45,025  -->  00:04:47,434
Then we also have a list of devices here,
103

103

00:04:47,434  -->  00:04:49,882
basically where we can test.
104

104

00:04:49,882  -->  00:04:52,096
So like the iPhone
105

105

00:04:52,096  -->  00:04:53,013
or iPhone 5
106

106

00:04:54,267  -->  00:04:56,350
or the Nexus or whatever.
107

107

00:04:57,821  -->  00:05:01,168
But we're mostly gonna use here our responsive.
108

108

00:05:01,168  -->  00:05:04,655
So we were talking about typography.
109

109

00:05:04,655  -->  00:05:06,425
What do we have in the typography?
110

110

00:05:06,425  -->  00:05:09,005
Well, we have the primary heading,
111

111

00:05:09,005  -->  00:05:13,172
we have secondary heading, tertiary heading and paragraph.
112

112

00:05:14,554  -->  00:05:16,780
Let's now take a look at what happens with these
113

113

00:05:16,780  -->  00:05:18,780
as we decrease our page.
114

114

00:05:24,134  -->  00:05:26,828
You see that they nicely adapt actually.
115

115

00:05:26,828  -->  00:05:29,245
And they still adapt in here.
116

116

00:05:31,127  -->  00:05:34,441
And only down here, almost at 600,
117

117

00:05:34,441  -->  00:05:36,223
this where it starts making some problems.
118

118

00:05:36,223  -->  00:05:40,213
So imagine that we had a device with 300, let's say,
119

119

00:05:40,213  -->  00:05:43,728
and then we would no longer see the text here at all.
120

120

00:05:43,728  -->  00:05:45,493
So we have to fix that.
121

121

00:05:45,493  -->  00:05:46,589
Another thing that I wanna fix
122

122

00:05:46,589  -->  00:05:49,452
is to actually get rid of this white border here
123

123

00:05:49,452  -->  00:05:52,227
on a smaller screen size.
124

124

00:05:52,227  -->  00:05:55,129
We can do that, I think, here at 900 pixels,
125

125

00:05:55,129  -->  00:05:57,960
so basically at the tablet portrait mode.
126

126

00:05:57,960  -->  00:05:58,999
So starting from here,
127

127

00:05:58,999  -->  00:06:02,249
let's get rid of this white border now.
128

128

00:06:03,392  -->  00:06:06,225
That is actually in base, I think.
129

129

00:06:09,663  -->  00:06:11,943
Well, it should be but it's not.
130

130

00:06:11,943  -->  00:06:15,289
Let's actually copy this one here to base,
131

131

00:06:15,289  -->  00:06:16,913
'cause there should be,
132

132

00:06:16,913  -->  00:06:18,596
yeah, there's one for the body
133

133

00:06:18,596  -->  00:06:19,589
and this is where it should be.
134

134

00:06:19,589  -->  00:06:22,636
This has nothing to do with typography.
135

135

00:06:22,636  -->  00:06:24,879
All right, so that's now actually include
136

136

00:06:24,879  -->  00:06:26,347
for media query here.
137

137

00:06:26,347  -->  00:06:28,564
I will just copy it from here.
138

138

00:06:28,564  -->  00:06:31,859
I'm lazy and I don't like to type so much,
139

139

00:06:31,859  -->  00:06:33,776
so just copy this here.
140

140

00:06:34,738  -->  00:06:37,571
Now let's get rid of this padding.
141

141

00:06:40,357  -->  00:06:41,190
Zero.
142

142

00:06:44,147  -->  00:06:45,558
Let's take a look.
143

143

00:06:45,558  -->  00:06:49,492
Let's reload, I'm not sure if it did reload automatically.
144

144

00:06:49,492  -->  00:06:51,795
Here it goes, the padding.
145

145

00:06:51,795  -->  00:06:55,742
Right here at this break point, now it's gone.
146

146

00:06:55,742  -->  00:06:56,802
And as soon as we increase it,
147

147

00:06:56,802  -->  00:06:58,855
then of course it comes back.
148

148

00:06:58,855  -->  00:07:01,410
That's the media query already doing its work.
149

149

00:07:01,410  -->  00:07:02,348
Great.
150

150

00:07:02,348  -->  00:07:05,869
But what we're doing here before was
151

151

00:07:05,869  -->  00:07:09,077
to actually decrease this entire text here,
152

152

00:07:09,077  -->  00:07:11,135
starting at 600 pixels,
153

153

00:07:11,135  -->  00:07:13,828
basically our phone media query.
154

154

00:07:13,828  -->  00:07:14,995
Let's do that.
155

155

00:07:16,586  -->  00:07:19,220
Typography and heading-primary.
156

156

00:07:19,220  -->  00:07:21,387
I'm putting it right here.
157

157

00:07:22,714  -->  00:07:25,964
Include respond(phone)
158

158

00:07:28,544  -->  00:07:30,772
and what do we want to happen here?
159

159

00:07:30,772  -->  00:07:32,415
Well, I think what we should do here
160

160

00:07:32,415  -->  00:07:36,582
is to actually get rid of all this letter spacing.
161

161

00:07:37,876  -->  00:07:42,043
Now I see that actually this should probably be in here.
162

162

00:07:44,045  -->  00:07:44,878
Right?
163

163

00:07:46,144  -->  00:07:49,072
Because this is where the font size is actually defined
164

164

00:07:49,072  -->  00:07:50,431
and the letter spacing.
165

165

00:07:50,431  -->  00:07:52,899
So let's get rid of the letter spacing,
166

166

00:07:52,899  -->  00:07:54,810
at least in part.
167

167

00:07:54,810  -->  00:07:57,623
We had 3.5 rem, let's put it back to one rem.
168

168

00:07:57,623  -->  00:08:01,790
And then the font size, let's decrease it to six rem.
169

169

00:08:02,726  -->  00:08:06,802
Well, six would be the same, so five rem.
170

170

00:08:06,802  -->  00:08:09,635
Then down here, let's do the same.
171

171

00:08:13,209  -->  00:08:15,542
Decrease the letter spacing,
172

172

00:08:16,807  -->  00:08:19,672
well, not to zero but maybe to five pixels,
173

173

00:08:19,672  -->  00:08:21,589
so .5 rem, for example.
174

174

00:08:23,485  -->  00:08:25,199
Let's take a look at that.
175

175

00:08:25,199  -->  00:08:28,550
And yeah, that looks a bit more natural now.
176

176

00:08:28,550  -->  00:08:29,383
And yeah.
177

177

00:08:30,517  -->  00:08:33,426
Actually already now have this last media query
178

178

00:08:33,426  -->  00:08:34,574
that we were missing.
179

179

00:08:34,574  -->  00:08:36,312
But now we have one in our actual code
180

180

00:08:36,312  -->  00:08:38,921
and then here it appears.
181

181

00:08:38,921  -->  00:08:41,301
So that looks better now.
182

182

00:08:41,301  -->  00:08:43,301
But what about our H2's?
183

183

00:08:50,323  -->  00:08:53,104
Well, I think they're probably a bit too big here
184

184

00:08:53,104  -->  00:08:54,854
at this point, right?
185

185

00:08:55,961  -->  00:08:58,066
Basically we should probably change them
186

186

00:08:58,066  -->  00:09:00,483
at the 900 pixel media query.
187

187

00:09:01,872  -->  00:09:03,539
So, tablet portrait.
188

188

00:09:04,446  -->  00:09:05,532
Let's do that.
189

189

00:09:05,532  -->  00:09:07,032
Heading-secondary.
190

190

00:09:09,702  -->  00:09:13,119
Include respond, and we call it tab-port.
191

191

00:09:16,640  -->  00:09:20,807
So let's decrease the font size to, like, 2.5 maybe.
192

192

00:09:21,887  -->  00:09:25,344
And then for the phone we can make it even smaller,
193

193

00:09:25,344  -->  00:09:27,246
2.5 like this.
194

194

00:09:27,246  -->  00:09:29,443
And then one for the phone.
195

195

00:09:29,443  -->  00:09:33,966
Remember, the phone is smaller so it comes after the tablet.
196

196

00:09:33,966  -->  00:09:37,049
So phone, and then let's say two rem.
197

197

00:09:39,592  -->  00:09:40,675
Check it out.
198

198

00:09:41,775  -->  00:09:44,858
And yeah, that looks probably better.
199

199

00:09:48,595  -->  00:09:50,696
We're not seeing it here on real devices.
200

200

00:09:50,696  -->  00:09:53,044
But for now it's okay to do it like this.
201

201

00:09:53,044  -->  00:09:55,694
Usually I always change everything here in the browser
202

202

00:09:55,694  -->  00:09:58,115
and then I start testing on real devices.
203

203

00:09:58,115  -->  00:10:00,682
And from there, I usually always see some stuff
204

204

00:10:00,682  -->  00:10:02,152
that I have to change afterwards.
205

205

00:10:02,152  -->  00:10:04,780
But essential things, so the first and major changes,
206

206

00:10:04,780  -->  00:10:06,386
they can be done here in the browser
207

207

00:10:06,386  -->  00:10:08,719
without any problem usually.
208

208

00:10:11,163  -->  00:10:12,019
All right.
209

209

00:10:12,019  -->  00:10:15,401
I think that for the H1 and H2,
210

210

00:10:15,401  -->  00:10:18,734
this is actually already changed enough.
211

211

00:10:21,642  -->  00:10:23,083
Maybe it's even a bit too small.
212

212

00:10:23,083  -->  00:10:24,231
I'm not really sure.
213

213

00:10:24,231  -->  00:10:27,551
So let's put it to three and then 2.5 or something.
214

214

00:10:27,551  -->  00:10:28,968
So three and 2.5.
215

215

00:10:30,894  -->  00:10:32,115
That should be better.
216

216

00:10:32,115  -->  00:10:33,976
All right, and with that we actually already finished
217

217

00:10:33,976  -->  00:10:38,176
the part about the typography and the base settings.
218

218

00:10:38,176  -->  00:10:40,881
Animations here, they don't need any changes.
219

219

00:10:40,881  -->  00:10:42,670
The utilities also don't need any changes,
220

220

00:10:42,670  -->  00:10:43,673
at least for now.
221

221

00:10:43,673  -->  00:10:45,774
Maybe we'll change something here a bit later.
222

222

00:10:45,774  -->  00:10:48,257
But for now we're good to go here in this folder.
223

223

00:10:48,257  -->  00:10:49,429
Then here in the abstracts folder,
224

224

00:10:49,429  -->  00:10:50,803
there are also no changes.
225

225

00:10:50,803  -->  00:10:53,357
So now let's move on to the layout.
226

226

00:10:53,357  -->  00:10:56,398
I wanna start with the grid, actually.
227

227

00:10:56,398  -->  00:10:59,726
So closing the typography, closing the mix-ins here as well.
228

228

00:10:59,726  -->  00:11:02,170
I'm gonna start with the grid.
229

229

00:11:02,170  -->  00:11:05,844
Let's take a look at what happens with the grid.
230

230

00:11:05,844  -->  00:11:08,412
Where do we have one of them?
231

231

00:11:08,412  -->  00:11:10,914
This is a grid with four columns in it.
232

232

00:11:10,914  -->  00:11:13,431
You see that they're becoming really small,
233

233

00:11:13,431  -->  00:11:15,352
so really, really small.
234

234

00:11:15,352  -->  00:11:17,454
And it doesn't look, like, good at all.
235

235

00:11:17,454  -->  00:11:19,121
The same thing here.
236

236

00:11:20,630  -->  00:11:22,484
Where else do we have?
237

237

00:11:22,484  -->  00:11:24,221
I don't think there's any more than this.
238

238

00:11:24,221  -->  00:11:25,359
Ah, here also, too.
239

239

00:11:25,359  -->  00:11:26,778
But here it's no problem.
240

240

00:11:26,778  -->  00:11:31,083
But here and here, it's definitely not okay like this.
241

241

00:11:31,083  -->  00:11:32,975
So let's go to our break point.
242

242

00:11:32,975  -->  00:11:37,458
I think where we should change it is here at 900.
243

243

00:11:37,458  -->  00:11:39,342
Here it's still kind of okay
244

244

00:11:39,342  -->  00:11:44,017
and we can later make some adjustments here to this.
245

245

00:11:44,017  -->  00:11:45,722
Right now it's still okay.
246

246

00:11:45,722  -->  00:11:47,843
But below this, these columns,
247

247

00:11:47,843  -->  00:11:50,474
they are definitely too narrow.
248

248

00:11:50,474  -->  00:11:52,809
So we can't wait until the next break point,
249

249

00:11:52,809  -->  00:11:54,343
which would be this one.
250

250

00:11:54,343  -->  00:11:57,280
We cannot have them looking like this.
251

251

00:11:57,280  -->  00:12:00,726
So we have to change the grid system right here
252

252

00:12:00,726  -->  00:12:04,207
at the tablet portrait break point.
253

253

00:12:04,207  -->  00:12:05,066
All right.
254

254

00:12:05,066  -->  00:12:07,260
And what are we going to do in order to fix this?
255

255

00:12:07,260  -->  00:12:09,171
Well, we're simply gonna set the width
256

256

00:12:09,171  -->  00:12:11,729
of all the columns to 100%.
257

257

00:12:11,729  -->  00:12:13,179
That's the easiest way to do it,
258

258

00:12:13,179  -->  00:12:16,262
and that's what's usually done on mobile devices.
259

259

00:12:16,262  -->  00:12:19,633
So all the columns are basically transformed into rows.
260

260

00:12:19,633  -->  00:12:21,983
So the entire mobile webpage will have
261

261

00:12:21,983  -->  00:12:25,345
only one single column, basically.
262

262

00:12:25,345  -->  00:12:28,928
Include respond(tab-port).
263

263

00:12:32,403  -->  00:12:36,607
So all of the columns should have a width of 100%.
264

264

00:12:36,607  -->  00:12:39,882
I'm gonna set it to important, actually,
265

265

00:12:39,882  -->  00:12:41,837
because I wanna make really sure
266

266

00:12:41,837  -->  00:12:45,478
that these widths here are overwritten.
267

267

00:12:45,478  -->  00:12:48,847
Now the next thing I have to do is to then, of course,
268

268

00:12:48,847  -->  00:12:51,930
remove any margin from these columns.
269

269

00:12:54,244  -->  00:12:57,127
'Cause right now they all have this gutter here.
270

270

00:12:57,127  -->  00:12:59,396
But since they're no longer side by side now,
271

271

00:12:59,396  -->  00:13:02,494
we don't need any gutter, right?
272

272

00:13:02,494  -->  00:13:05,161
So margin-right: 0, very simple.
273

273

00:13:07,136  -->  00:13:11,303
Next up what we should probably change is this gutter here.
274

274

00:13:12,330  -->  00:13:14,533
So let's open up the variables.
275

275

00:13:14,533  -->  00:13:18,033
This gutter is in 80 pixels, or eight rem,
276

276

00:13:20,310  -->  00:13:22,275
'cause 80 pixels is no longer accurate
277

277

00:13:22,275  -->  00:13:24,673
on these lower media queries.
278

278

00:13:24,673  -->  00:13:26,146
So we have eight rem here.
279

279

00:13:26,146  -->  00:13:28,215
But that's way too much, I believe.
280

280

00:13:28,215  -->  00:13:32,382
So let's create a new variable here called gutter-vertical
281

281

00:13:34,974  -->  00:13:37,836
for six rem, called small.
282

282

00:13:37,836  -->  00:13:39,919
So gutter-vertical-small.
283

283

00:13:42,764  -->  00:13:43,653
Where is that?
284

284

00:13:43,653  -->  00:13:45,878
And yeah, here we go.
285

285

00:13:45,878  -->  00:13:50,131
Again, I'm gonna copy this, and where is it?
286

286

00:13:50,131  -->  00:13:51,803
Okay, right here.
287

287

00:13:51,803  -->  00:13:54,386
Notice it's starting to look a bit confusing.
288

288

00:13:54,386  -->  00:13:57,303
(chuckles) I know.
289

289

00:13:59,881  -->  00:14:01,168
But I think that's okay
290

290

00:14:01,168  -->  00:14:04,050
given how much writing our code in this way here,
291

291

00:14:04,050  -->  00:14:07,095
which may look a bit strange, improves our lives
292

292

00:14:07,095  -->  00:14:10,762
over just writing original vanilla CSS code.
293

293

00:14:12,492  -->  00:14:15,343
Even if looks a bit strange with all this nesting going on
294

294

00:14:15,343  -->  00:14:17,584
that this includes and all of that going on,
295

295

00:14:17,584  -->  00:14:21,334
you will see that you will become used to it.
296

296

00:14:22,433  -->  00:14:24,058
So it's not really a problem.
297

297

00:14:24,058  -->  00:14:26,736
So gutter-vertical-small here,
298

298

00:14:26,736  -->  00:14:28,831
just to confirm that the name is right.
299

299

00:14:28,831  -->  00:14:32,190
Then let's take a look at it, actually.
300

300

00:14:32,190  -->  00:14:34,509
Well, that doesn't look so good for now.
301

301

00:14:34,509  -->  00:14:37,415
That's because these images here are huge and overlapping.
302

302

00:14:37,415  -->  00:14:40,050
We're gonna fix that later.
303

303

00:14:40,050  -->  00:14:42,458
So one column, next column, next column.
304

304

00:14:42,458  -->  00:14:45,625
But of course this is not ideal at all
305

305

00:14:46,995  -->  00:14:48,724
because we probably want some margin here
306

306

00:14:48,724  -->  00:14:51,194
between these columns now, right?
307

307

00:14:51,194  -->  00:14:52,566
Because the columns there are basically now
308

308

00:14:52,566  -->  00:14:55,983
no longer columns but just like sub-rows.
309

309

00:14:56,917  -->  00:14:58,309
So each of these here should probably
310

310

00:14:58,309  -->  00:15:00,816
have a margin at the bottom.
311

311

00:15:00,816  -->  00:15:03,893
Now, I also have some space here on the right side.
312

312

00:15:03,893  -->  00:15:05,738
I'm not really sure why that is happening.
313

313

00:15:05,738  -->  00:15:08,155
So let's take a look at that.
314

314

00:15:10,434  -->  00:15:12,035
Ah, it's because of the row.
315

315

00:15:12,035  -->  00:15:12,961
I'm not sure what's going on.
316

316

00:15:12,961  -->  00:15:14,432
Let's take a look.
317

317

00:15:14,432  -->  00:15:17,004
Oh, the row has a margin-right of six rem.
318

318

00:15:17,004  -->  00:15:17,837
Why is that?
319

319

00:15:17,837  -->  00:15:21,776
Ah, of course, this should be margin-bottom,
320

320

00:15:21,776  -->  00:15:23,636
not margin-right.
321

321

00:15:23,636  -->  00:15:24,950
So margin-bottom, we had it here
322

322

00:15:24,950  -->  00:15:28,698
and then we changed it with the media query.
323

323

00:15:28,698  -->  00:15:30,891
Okay, what I was saying is that here,
324

324

00:15:30,891  -->  00:15:33,763
the columns, they no longer should have a margin-right.
325

325

00:15:33,763  -->  00:15:34,628
So we change that.
326

326

00:15:34,628  -->  00:15:38,340
But they should have a margin at the bottom.
327

327

00:15:38,340  -->  00:15:39,799
I would say it would make sense
328

328

00:15:39,799  -->  00:15:43,216
to make it gutter-vertical-small as well,
329

329

00:15:45,240  -->  00:15:48,230
because now it's actually vertically aligned
330

330

00:15:48,230  -->  00:15:49,719
and no longer horizontal.
331

331

00:15:49,719  -->  00:15:52,219
Let's take a look at that now.
332

332

00:15:53,616  -->  00:15:55,521
While it doesn't look ideal for now
333

333

00:15:55,521  -->  00:15:59,488
because this is way too wide, of course,
334

334

00:15:59,488  -->  00:16:01,389
the row and the columns itself,
335

335

00:16:01,389  -->  00:16:04,889
they look better now than they did before.
336

336

00:16:09,880  -->  00:16:11,462
And the same thing here, of course.
337

337

00:16:11,462  -->  00:16:14,302
We now have to change some more here about the row,
338

338

00:16:14,302  -->  00:16:18,277
but the distance between them looks okay for now.
339

339

00:16:18,277  -->  00:16:22,100
So what we should do here is to also change
340

340

00:16:22,100  -->  00:16:24,455
this max-width here, okay?
341

341

00:16:24,455  -->  00:16:28,125
Right now, the row is occupying 100% of the available width
342

342

00:16:28,125  -->  00:16:31,648
because the view port is smaller than the grid width,
343

343

00:16:31,648  -->  00:16:34,148
which is, as you see, 114 rem.
344

344

00:16:36,174  -->  00:16:39,218
So what max-width does is that,
345

345

00:16:39,218  -->  00:16:41,874
if the width is lower than the grid width,
346

346

00:16:41,874  -->  00:16:45,450
then it will simply occupy 100% of its available width.
347

347

00:16:45,450  -->  00:16:49,617
But we should now actually change that to a smaller value.
348

348

00:16:51,975  -->  00:16:56,142
Let's put it to something like 50 rem or something.
349

349

00:16:57,833  -->  00:17:02,000
Max-width: 50rem, and it will probably fix this problem.
350

350

00:17:04,421  -->  00:17:05,264
Yeah.
351

351

00:17:05,264  -->  00:17:08,097
That looks a lot more natural now.
352

352

00:17:09,366  -->  00:17:10,199
All right.
353

353

00:17:13,059  -->  00:17:15,726
That looks kind of good already.
354

354

00:17:17,818  -->  00:17:19,849
Not perfect, of course, but acceptable.
355

355

00:17:19,849  -->  00:17:21,521
So let's take a look at how this will look
356

356

00:17:21,521  -->  00:17:23,521
on an iPad, for example.
357

357

00:17:25,471  -->  00:17:26,766
Here is a problem, of course.
358

358

00:17:26,766  -->  00:17:28,183
But we're gonna fix this one
359

359

00:17:28,183  -->  00:17:31,673
when we start looking at the individual components.
360

360

00:17:31,673  -->  00:17:34,004
Right now we're still talking about the width
361

361

00:17:34,004  -->  00:17:37,050
and/or the layout of the page.
362

362

00:17:37,050  -->  00:17:38,524
But this looks okay.
363

363

00:17:38,524  -->  00:17:41,731
So I think for the grid, we're good to go for now.
364

364

00:17:41,731  -->  00:17:43,448
And the smaller, minor things,
365

365

00:17:43,448  -->  00:17:47,115
we're going to fix them later down the road.
366

366

00:17:49,419  -->  00:17:52,173
Next up, let's talk about the header.
367

367

00:17:52,173  -->  00:17:55,139
Well, the only thing that I see really happening here
368

368

00:17:55,139  -->  00:17:57,332
is maybe this line here.
369

369

00:17:57,332  -->  00:18:00,414
It's becoming way too, like, way too steep.
370

370

00:18:00,414  -->  00:18:03,574
So in comparison to this one here which has this slope,
371

371

00:18:03,574  -->  00:18:06,179
then this one here has a really higher slope.
372

372

00:18:06,179  -->  00:18:08,663
And it doesn't look really good any more.
373

373

00:18:08,663  -->  00:18:11,223
This was the initial look we were looking for,
374

374

00:18:11,223  -->  00:18:12,999
something like this.
375

375

00:18:12,999  -->  00:18:15,817
But now, as we really decrease the screen,
376

376

00:18:15,817  -->  00:18:19,296
especially moving on here to the mobile screen,
377

377

00:18:19,296  -->  00:18:22,024
then it starts looking a bit weird.
378

378

00:18:22,024  -->  00:18:26,519
So let's change that now for the phone only.
379

379

00:18:26,519  -->  00:18:27,848
So closing the grid here
380

380

00:18:27,848  -->  00:18:31,431
and moving on to the header, so right here.
381

381

00:18:34,079  -->  00:18:37,412
Include respond(phone).
382

382

00:18:41,820  -->  00:18:43,613
And then so what we have to change
383

383

00:18:43,613  -->  00:18:45,780
is these clip-path's here.
384

384

00:18:46,939  -->  00:18:50,191
I'm gonna change them to 90 vh.
385

385

00:18:50,191  -->  00:18:53,191
That will probably fix that problem.
386

386

00:18:57,341  -->  00:18:58,508
So here we go.
387

387

00:19:00,469  -->  00:19:03,190
Well, maybe 90 is even a bit too much.
388

388

00:19:03,190  -->  00:19:04,773
Let's put it to 85.
389

389

00:19:07,830  -->  00:19:10,499
The same thing here as well.
390

390

00:19:10,499  -->  00:19:13,249
And yeah, that looks pretty good.
391

391

00:19:15,631  -->  00:19:19,123
At 620, it's like this and then, bam!
392

392

00:19:19,123  -->  00:19:19,956
There it goes.
393

393

00:19:19,956  -->  00:19:23,399
The next media query, and our change is there.
394

394

00:19:23,399  -->  00:19:25,060
Now, another thing that we should probably change
395

395

00:19:25,060  -->  00:19:26,658
is this navigation here.
396

396

00:19:26,658  -->  00:19:28,742
It looks a bit too much now here
397

397

00:19:28,742  -->  00:19:31,096
moving into the center of the stage.
398

398

00:19:31,096  -->  00:19:34,096
Let's put it a bit more here, up in the corner,
399

399

00:19:34,096  -->  00:19:38,472
in order to make it look more similar here to this image.
400

400

00:19:38,472  -->  00:19:41,639
Let's do that and open the navigation.
401

401

00:19:44,269  -->  00:19:47,769
What we have to change here is the button.
402

402

00:19:49,619  -->  00:19:53,786
Include respond, and then let's actually take a look
403

403

00:19:55,145  -->  00:19:57,972
at where we want to change this.
404

404

00:19:57,972  -->  00:20:01,320
I think it starts appearing even before.
405

405

00:20:01,320  -->  00:20:04,092
Yeah, so I think we should already start it here,
406

406

00:20:04,092  -->  00:20:06,871
closer to the 900 pixel media query,
407

407

00:20:06,871  -->  00:20:11,038
because it starts looking off already here at this point.
408

408

00:20:11,976  -->  00:20:13,309
So, tablet port.
409

409

00:20:16,362  -->  00:20:19,925
So we have six rem here for both the top and the right.
410

410

00:20:19,925  -->  00:20:22,365
Let's decrease that by two
411

411

00:20:22,365  -->  00:20:25,572
and put it to four in these two.
412

412

00:20:25,572  -->  00:20:29,655
And then the same thing here, for the background.
413

413

00:20:31,572  -->  00:20:33,112
Well, I don't know what this is doing here.
414

414

00:20:33,112  -->  00:20:34,695
So let's remove it.
415

415

00:20:36,261  -->  00:20:40,074
Also decreasing it by two makes it 4.5 and 4.5.
416

416

00:20:40,074  -->  00:20:43,574
So sorry, double cursors here, .5 on both.
417

417

00:20:45,355  -->  00:20:47,027
Take a look.
418

418

00:20:47,027  -->  00:20:49,674
Oh yeah, that's much better.
419

419

00:20:49,674  -->  00:20:51,358
And for a phone, it's good as well.
420

420

00:20:51,358  -->  00:20:53,591
So we don't need a new media query here.
421

421

00:20:53,591  -->  00:20:55,469
Well, actually we could do a new media query.
422

422

00:20:55,469  -->  00:20:56,302
Why not?
423

423

00:20:56,302  -->  00:20:57,692
Let's take a look at how it will look
424

424

00:20:57,692  -->  00:21:00,576
at an iPhone 5, for example.
425

425

00:21:00,576  -->  00:21:03,794
For now, maybe just ignore that this is happening here.
426

426

00:21:03,794  -->  00:21:06,569
I'm not really sure why.
427

427

00:21:06,569  -->  00:21:08,986
I mean this white space here.
428

428

00:21:10,987  -->  00:21:13,123
Well, it looks like it's because of this element here,
429

429

00:21:13,123  -->  00:21:16,439
probably moving out of the page.
430

430

00:21:16,439  -->  00:21:19,720
So this is why this weird white stripe here
431

431

00:21:19,720  -->  00:21:21,114
is happening on the side.
432

432

00:21:21,114  -->  00:21:22,572
Anyway, we can see that this is quite
433

433

00:21:22,572  -->  00:21:24,202
not really good on the phone.
434

434

00:21:24,202  -->  00:21:28,369
So let's simply add another query for the phone here.
435

435

00:21:33,834  -->  00:21:35,751
Let's say three, three,
436

436

00:21:39,256  -->  00:21:42,089
and then the same thing over here.
437

437

00:21:46,737  -->  00:21:48,431
So yeah, now we're good.
438

438

00:21:48,431  -->  00:21:50,134
We have to change it to responsive
439

439

00:21:50,134  -->  00:21:51,505
and then we can click here
440

440

00:21:51,505  -->  00:21:54,851
in order to move across our view ports.
441

441

00:21:54,851  -->  00:21:56,904
So navigation looks better now.
442

442

00:21:56,904  -->  00:21:58,155
Actually, let's open it.
443

443

00:21:58,155  -->  00:22:00,608
And as you can see, it looks pretty good
444

444

00:22:00,608  -->  00:22:05,001
without even changing a thing, even on these smaller sizes.
445

445

00:22:05,001  -->  00:22:07,431
So everything's fine, everything's good.
446

446

00:22:07,431  -->  00:22:10,264
The header looks good as well now.
447

447

00:22:12,750  -->  00:22:14,198
So now let's take a look at the footer,
448

448

00:22:14,198  -->  00:22:17,336
which is the final layout part which we have here.
449

449

00:22:17,336  -->  00:22:20,028
So we see now that probably we should make these
450

450

00:22:20,028  -->  00:22:22,702
100% as well, such as the columns,
451

451

00:22:22,702  -->  00:22:25,402
and then probably center all of this on the page.
452

452

00:22:25,402  -->  00:22:27,880
We can decrease the space here as well a little bit
453

453

00:22:27,880  -->  00:22:30,533
and maybe even this padding.
454

454

00:22:30,533  -->  00:22:35,501
Yeah, so there's a couple of things to change here.
455

455

00:22:35,501  -->  00:22:36,918
So let's do that.
456

456

00:22:38,209  -->  00:22:39,741
The first thing that we wanna change
457

457

00:22:39,741  -->  00:22:42,408
is the padding, as I was saying.
458

458

00:22:43,412  -->  00:22:47,267
Include respond, and I'm gonna make it
459

459

00:22:47,267  -->  00:22:49,433
for the tablet in portrait again.
460

460

00:22:49,433  -->  00:22:52,194
You see that this is probably the most important break point
461

461

00:22:52,194  -->  00:22:55,725
we've been working on, along with the phone actually.
462

462

00:22:55,725  -->  00:22:58,282
So this tablet in landscape is not really
463

463

00:22:58,282  -->  00:23:00,418
such an important break point from my experience.
464

464

00:23:00,418  -->  00:23:02,731
The most important one is this tablet in portrait,
465

465

00:23:02,731  -->  00:23:06,562
so 900 pixels, and the phone at 600 pixels.
466

466

00:23:06,562  -->  00:23:08,054
For the tablet in landscape mode,
467

467

00:23:08,054  -->  00:23:11,251
well, the most important change, we already did it
468

468

00:23:11,251  -->  00:23:13,108
by doing this.
469

469

00:23:13,108  -->  00:23:15,785
In here we basically decreased the entire page.
470

470

00:23:15,785  -->  00:23:16,886
We zoomed it down.
471

471

00:23:16,886  -->  00:23:19,393
And that was already enough to make it looking good
472

472

00:23:19,393  -->  00:23:23,560
for width up until 1,200 pixels, so between 900 and 1,200.
473

473

00:23:25,490  -->  00:23:27,748
Now, let's change the padding here then
474

474

00:23:27,748  -->  00:23:31,581
to a bit like eight ram and zero, for example.
475

475

00:23:34,438  -->  00:23:39,121
Then what we should change next is the navigation.
476

476

00:23:39,121  -->  00:23:41,917
Because remember, let's just take a look at the HTML
477

477

00:23:41,917  -->  00:23:45,050
so that we're on the same page here.
478

478

00:23:45,050  -->  00:23:47,790
The footer_navigation and the footer_copyright
479

479

00:23:47,790  -->  00:23:50,499
are these two elements that are basically side by side.
480

480

00:23:50,499  -->  00:23:54,666
So these are the ones we should manipulate right now.
481

481

00:23:58,101  -->  00:24:02,268
Let's say we want the width of 100% on this one,
482

482

00:24:03,630  -->  00:24:06,213
and a text-align set to center.
483

483

00:24:07,624  -->  00:24:10,338
Let's see what that looks like.
484

484

00:24:10,338  -->  00:24:12,126
And yeah, that's much better already.
485

485

00:24:12,126  -->  00:24:13,680
But still not quite what we want
486

486

00:24:13,680  -->  00:24:15,442
because this line should probably not go
487

487

00:24:15,442  -->  00:24:17,073
all the way until here.
488

488

00:24:17,073  -->  00:24:20,086
But let's take care of that in a second.
489

489

00:24:20,086  -->  00:24:23,753
For now, let's change this one here as well.
490

490

00:24:25,657  -->  00:24:27,490
That is the copyright.
491

491

00:24:29,727  -->  00:24:32,105
We also want the width to be 80%.
492

492

00:24:32,105  -->  00:24:35,272
And then we don't want any float here.
493

493

00:24:36,672  -->  00:24:38,505
So float: none, right?
494

494

00:24:41,885  -->  00:24:43,409
Okay, and that looks better.
495

495

00:24:43,409  -->  00:24:45,688
But it's, again, still not perfect.
496

496

00:24:45,688  -->  00:24:47,785
That is because there is one thing that we should do
497

497

00:24:47,785  -->  00:24:49,692
and we haven't done up until this point,
498

498

00:24:49,692  -->  00:24:53,224
which is basically setting a padding for the row.
499

499

00:24:53,224  -->  00:24:56,820
'Cause remember, these two are in a row, right?
500

500

00:24:56,820  -->  00:24:58,255
So these two are the columns
501

501

00:24:58,255  -->  00:25:00,598
and they are inside of this row.
502

502

00:25:00,598  -->  00:25:03,902
And this row here, it has a width of 50 rem.
503

503

00:25:03,902  -->  00:25:06,085
That's probably way more than the width here
504

504

00:25:06,085  -->  00:25:08,002
at this view port size.
505

505

00:25:08,876  -->  00:25:13,281
And that's why we're simply having 100% of the width.
506

506

00:25:13,281  -->  00:25:16,991
We can also observe the same thing going on in here.
507

507

00:25:16,991  -->  00:25:20,460
So we should probably have some padding on this width.
508

508

00:25:20,460  -->  00:25:21,745
Sorry, on the row.
509

509

00:25:21,745  -->  00:25:25,328
So a padding on the row is what we should have.
510

510

00:25:25,328  -->  00:25:28,158
On the left and on the right side.
511

511

00:25:28,158  -->  00:25:30,125
Let's go back to the grid.
512

512

00:25:30,125  -->  00:25:32,485
And you'll see that this going a bit back and forth
513

513

00:25:32,485  -->  00:25:33,588
between different stuff.
514

514

00:25:33,588  -->  00:25:36,848
But, well, that's just how it goes.
515

515

00:25:36,848  -->  00:25:40,900
Writing media queries is maybe not the most fun thing to do,
516

516

00:25:40,900  -->  00:25:42,779
but we still have to do it, of course.
517

517

00:25:42,779  -->  00:25:45,113
And it's not so bad in my opinion, actually.
518

518

00:25:45,113  -->  00:25:47,436
So we were saying that we want a padding on the row.
519

519

00:25:47,436  -->  00:25:51,117
So this here is the place where we should do it.
520

520

00:25:51,117  -->  00:25:53,459
So padding, top and bottom, is zero.
521

521

00:25:53,459  -->  00:25:54,908
But we want it on the sides.
522

522

00:25:54,908  -->  00:25:58,287
Let's put, like, some three rems here
523

523

00:25:58,287  -->  00:26:00,789
and take a look at that.
524

524

00:26:00,789  -->  00:26:01,622
All right.
525

525

00:26:02,674  -->  00:26:04,424
That's better, right?
526

526

00:26:06,006  -->  00:26:08,923
That's much, much better, actually.
527

527

00:26:12,441  -->  00:26:14,136
Well, something weird, ah, yeah, okay.
528

528

00:26:14,136  -->  00:26:17,303
We have this scrolling going on still.
529

529

00:26:18,328  -->  00:26:21,850
The page is right now larger than the screen
530

530

00:26:21,850  -->  00:26:24,250
and so there is something that we will have to fix
531

531

00:26:24,250  -->  00:26:26,111
a bit later once again.
532

532

00:26:26,111  -->  00:26:28,106
For now let's just continue with our media queries
533

533
