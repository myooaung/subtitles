00:00:01.512  -->  00:00:02.629
<v Jonas>In this lecture,</v>
2

2

00:00:02.629  -->  00:00:06.802
we are going to build the features section of our website.
3

3

00:00:06.802  -->  00:00:08.375
And so what you're gonna learn here
4

4

00:00:08.375  -->  00:00:11.816
is how and why to create grids inside of grids,
5

5

00:00:11.816  -->  00:00:15.706
how to create a responsive component without media queries,
6

6

00:00:15.706  -->  00:00:18.673
and again, you already know this last part
7

7

00:00:18.673  -->  00:00:21.058
so we did that already in the intro section,
8

8

00:00:21.058  -->  00:00:23.083
but again this time, we are going to do it
9

9

00:00:23.083  -->  00:00:25.138
in a real world scenario.
10

10

00:00:25.138  -->  00:00:28.092
And then finally, we will build even a very small component
11

11

00:00:28.092  -->  00:00:30.425
using the power of CSS grid.
12

12

00:00:31.348  -->  00:00:34.796
And so we're gonna start with this part here of the website,
13

13

00:00:34.796  -->  00:00:37.162
so the features section, as I was saying.
14

14

00:00:37.162  -->  00:00:38.744
Now I chose to go with this first
15

15

00:00:38.744  -->  00:00:42.755
because it's a lot more simple than this section actually,
16

16

00:00:42.755  -->  00:00:44.344
so the header or the realtors.
17

17

00:00:44.344  -->  00:00:47.321
So this one is easier, and so that's perfect to get started
18

18

00:00:47.321  -->  00:00:48.305
with this page.
19

19

00:00:48.305  -->  00:00:51.508
And we will then come back to this top part here
20

20

00:00:51.508  -->  00:00:53.341
and do it later, okay.
21

21

00:00:54.410  -->  00:00:56.723
So what we have here are basically six features
22

22

00:00:56.723  -->  00:00:59.054
laid out in a two by three grid.
23

23

00:00:59.054  -->  00:01:01.950
So three columns and two rows.
24

24

00:01:01.950  -->  00:01:03.955
And so this is of course a perfect use case
25

25

00:01:03.955  -->  00:01:06.329
for using CSS grid.
26

26

00:01:06.329  -->  00:01:10.022
So let's again start doing that in our markup.
27

27

00:01:10.022  -->  00:01:13.105
And let's actually close all of these
28

28

00:01:15.743  -->  00:01:19.448
SASS files here, and then start with our markup.
29

29

00:01:19.448  -->  00:01:22.184
So here in the features section,
30

30

00:01:22.184  -->  00:01:26.351
so let's again use Emmet to place six features here.
31

31

00:01:27.915  -->  00:01:31.245
So we're going to call each of these simply feature,
32

32

00:01:31.245  -->  00:01:33.545
and now let me show you something else with Emmet.
33

33

00:01:33.545  -->  00:01:35.459
So in the CodePen lectures, I already showed you
34

34

00:01:35.459  -->  00:01:39.267
that we can use this dollar sign here to number stuff,
35

35

00:01:39.267  -->  00:01:42.226
but we can also use Emmet to introduce some text
36

36

00:01:42.226  -->  00:01:45.053
into the HTML element right off the bat.
37

37

00:01:45.053  -->  00:01:48.107
So and for that, we just have to use the curly bracket
38

38

00:01:48.107  -->  00:01:50.953
and so let's say that we want to number these features
39

39

00:01:50.953  -->  00:01:52.286
from one to six,
40

40

00:01:53.541  -->  00:01:56.261
so in each of them we want to say feature
41

41

00:01:56.261  -->  00:01:58.253
and then the number,
42

42

00:01:58.253  -->  00:02:01.138
and then we multiply it by six.
43

43

00:02:01.138  -->  00:02:02.246
And that's it.
44

44

00:02:02.246  -->  00:02:04.087
So each of them is now called feature,
45

45

00:02:04.087  -->  00:02:06.999
and then the text in there will say feature one, two, three,
46

46

00:02:06.999  -->  00:02:08.542
four, five, six.
47

47

00:02:08.542  -->  00:02:10.641
Okay, so for now we don't have all the content
48

48

00:02:10.641  -->  00:02:12.608
inside of each of these features,
49

49

00:02:12.608  -->  00:02:14.674
like I showed you in the demo.
50

50

00:02:14.674  -->  00:02:18.326
But just some text so that we can lay out our grid actually.
51

51

00:02:18.326  -->  00:02:20.471
So let's open our features SASS file
52

52

00:02:20.471  -->  00:02:22.804
and start writing some code.
53

53

00:02:23.827  -->  00:02:26.852
So this features element here is a grid item,
54

54

00:02:26.852  -->  00:02:30.771
but now we want this grid item to also be a grid container.
55

55

00:02:30.771  -->  00:02:33.809
So that's just the same thing as we have in flex box,
56

56

00:02:33.809  -->  00:02:37.893
where a flex item can easily become a flex container.
57

57

00:02:37.893  -->  00:02:42.380
So all we have to do is to write display: grid,
58

58

00:02:42.380  -->  00:02:43.520
and that's it.
59

59

00:02:43.520  -->  00:02:47.831
So right now, this features element is a grid container.
60

60

00:02:47.831  -->  00:02:49.933
Now it would be really helpful and great
61

61

00:02:49.933  -->  00:02:53.148
to have something called a subgrid here.
62

62

00:02:53.148  -->  00:02:55.659
And that's actually something that's coming to CSS grid
63

63

00:02:55.659  -->  00:02:58.001
in the second level of the specification.
64

64

00:02:58.001  -->  00:03:00.856
But right now, subgrids are not available.
65

65

00:03:00.856  -->  00:03:03.947
So what will a subgrid actually be?
66

66

00:03:03.947  -->  00:03:08.452
So basically it will allow a grid that is inside a grid,
67

67

00:03:08.452  -->  00:03:12.464
so like in this case here, to like snap it's tracks
68

68

00:03:12.464  -->  00:03:14.134
to the parent grid.
69

69

00:03:14.134  -->  00:03:16.983
For example, align its columns with the columns
70

70

00:03:16.983  -->  00:03:18.800
of the parent grid.
71

71

00:03:18.800  -->  00:03:21.287
So in this example, we could then make it so
72

72

00:03:21.287  -->  00:03:23.292
that the columns of this small grid
73

73

00:03:23.292  -->  00:03:25.715
would automatically be where the columns
74

74

00:03:25.715  -->  00:03:28.305
of our overall page layout are.
75

75

00:03:28.305  -->  00:03:30.029
Right, does that make sense?
76

76

00:03:30.029  -->  00:03:32.505
And actually that would be really helpful here,
77

77

00:03:32.505  -->  00:03:35.118
but right now that's just not possible.
78

78

00:03:35.118  -->  00:03:37.216
So we need to manually create new columns
79

79

00:03:37.216  -->  00:03:39.231
for this grid container.
80

80

00:03:39.231  -->  00:03:41.597
So just to show you what I mean with the subgrid,
81

81

00:03:41.597  -->  00:03:44.183
so it would be like creating a grid
82

82

00:03:44.183  -->  00:03:46.315
where we could automatically say that one column
83

83

00:03:46.315  -->  00:03:50.482
should be like these two columns here from the parent grid.
84

84

00:03:52.248  -->  00:03:55.103
So basically snapping to this tracks.
85

85

00:03:55.103  -->  00:03:57.272
But right now, again, that's not possible
86

86

00:03:57.272  -->  00:04:00.928
so we're just gonna manually create our grid.
87

87

00:04:00.928  -->  00:04:03.595
So let's start with the columns,
88

88

00:04:05.282  -->  00:04:07.707
grid-template-columns,
89

89

00:04:07.707  -->  00:04:11.162
and remember we want three columns here,
90

90

00:04:11.162  -->  00:04:14.223
and so we just say three columns
91

91

00:04:14.223  -->  00:04:17.416
with one fractional unit each.
92

92

00:04:17.416  -->  00:04:18.257
And that's it,
93

93

00:04:18.257  -->  00:04:21.128
that's three equally sized columns right there.
94

94

00:04:21.128  -->  00:04:22.321
Now about the rows,
95

95

00:04:22.321  -->  00:04:24.955
we don't actually need to specify anything for the rows.
96

96

00:04:24.955  -->  00:04:27.226
I mean, we could do it, and we would do it
97

97

00:04:27.226  -->  00:04:28.893
basically like this,
98

98

00:04:30.520  -->  00:04:32.646
so grid-template-rows, and then we could just say
99

99

00:04:32.646  -->  00:04:35.394
auto and auto, but that's not necessary at all
100

100

00:04:35.394  -->  00:04:37.877
because that's just what's gonna happen anyway
101

101

00:04:37.877  -->  00:04:39.400
if you don't define anything at all.
102

102

00:04:39.400  -->  00:04:40.512
And so we don't need this.
103

103

00:04:40.512  -->  00:04:42.332
What actually will happen is that we create
104

104

00:04:42.332  -->  00:04:45.039
an implicit grid, right.
105

105

00:04:45.039  -->  00:04:47.268
So all of our items will basically be placed
106

106

00:04:47.268  -->  00:04:50.421
in an implicit grid, and not in an explicit grid
107

107

00:04:50.421  -->  00:04:52.216
because we don't define the rows,
108

108

00:04:52.216  -->  00:04:55.511
so we have like zero cells defined for our grid.
109

109

00:04:55.511  -->  00:04:56.853
But that's not a problem at all,
110

110

00:04:56.853  -->  00:04:58.776
it works just the same.
111

111

00:04:58.776  -->  00:05:02.677
So let's get rid of this, and then we're good to go.
112

112

00:05:02.677  -->  00:05:05.377
And actually let's take a look at that,
113

113

00:05:05.377  -->  00:05:07.469
so that you can see that it's actually true.
114

114

00:05:07.469  -->  00:05:09.073
And here we go.
115

115

00:05:09.073  -->  00:05:11.240
So we have now feature one, two, three, four,
116

116

00:05:11.240  -->  00:05:15.400
and five and six, all laid out like in our demo.
117

117

00:05:15.400  -->  00:05:19.567
And we can also see that here in the dev tools, quite well,
118

118

00:05:20.594  -->  00:05:22.762
so let's select this one here,
119

119

00:05:22.762  -->  00:05:25.980
and then it will deselect our overall grid, right,
120

120

00:05:25.980  -->  00:05:28.873
so we can either have this one or this one.
121

121

00:05:28.873  -->  00:05:31.836
And so down here now you see our grid,
122

122

00:05:31.836  -->  00:05:33.930
so our three by two grid.
123

123

00:05:33.930  -->  00:05:36.313
And you see that the line here is dotted,
124

124

00:05:36.313  -->  00:05:37.711
and as I explained to you before,
125

125

00:05:37.711  -->  00:05:41.215
that means that these are row tracks of an implicit grid.
126

126

00:05:41.215  -->  00:05:43.226
Now the next step is to actually get rid
127

127

00:05:43.226  -->  00:05:45.796
of this huge font size here, and the padding,
128

128

00:05:45.796  -->  00:05:47.966
that we gave this here just for testing purposes,
129

129

00:05:47.966  -->  00:05:50.216
and then get rid of the background color
130

130

00:05:50.216  -->  00:05:52.646
and also add some margin to the top and bottom
131

131

00:05:52.646  -->  00:05:55.844
of this overall parent element.
132

132

00:05:55.844  -->  00:05:57.261
So let's do that.
133

133

00:05:58.314  -->  00:06:02.130
And I'm gonna put it here before the grid stuff definition,
134

134

00:06:02.130  -->  00:06:06.297
so margin, and I want 15 rem on top and on the bottom.
135

135

00:06:07.442  -->  00:06:11.607
And let's get rid of the background color as well.
136

136

00:06:11.607  -->  00:06:15.163
Then in the base, let's also delete this.
137

137

00:06:15.163  -->  00:06:18.696
And so that should look a lot more natural now.
138

138

00:06:18.696  -->  00:06:21.888
Alright, so we can also add, of course
139

139

00:06:21.888  -->  00:06:25.055
a gap here, which we haven't done yet.
140

140

00:06:26.714  -->  00:06:28.507
And let's set it to 60 pixels,
141

141

00:06:28.507  -->  00:06:29.424
so six rem.
142

142

00:06:31.046  -->  00:06:31.879
Alright.
143

143

00:06:33.620  -->  00:06:35.333
And yeah, so that's better.
144

144

00:06:35.333  -->  00:06:37.650
And so now we're ready to start filling this up
145

145

00:06:37.650  -->  00:06:39.685
with the actual content.
146

146

00:06:39.685  -->  00:06:42.236
So what do we have here actually for the content?
147

147

00:06:42.236  -->  00:06:44.137
Let's take a look at that,
148

148

00:06:44.137  -->  00:06:47.808
and so here we see that we have like this icon here,
149

149

00:06:47.808  -->  00:06:50.631
and that comes from an SVG icon sprite
150

150

00:06:50.631  -->  00:06:53.271
that I already included in our image folder,
151

151

00:06:53.271  -->  00:06:56.077
so this time we're not going to go through
152

152

00:06:56.077  -->  00:06:58.675
manually creating that SVG sprite
153

153

00:06:58.675  -->  00:07:00.817
like we did in the last project,
154

154

00:07:00.817  -->  00:07:02.768
because right now you already know how to do that,
155

155

00:07:02.768  -->  00:07:04.781
and so I did it so that we can just use it
156

156

00:07:04.781  -->  00:07:07.864
and don't waste any time doing that.
157

157

00:07:07.864  -->  00:07:11.021
So we have the icon, and we have like this heading here,
158

158

00:07:11.021  -->  00:07:14.569
and then after that the paragraph with this text.
159

159

00:07:14.569  -->  00:07:16.598
Now this heading here, you see that it has
160

160

00:07:16.598  -->  00:07:19.386
this different font size than this one here, right.
161

161

00:07:19.386  -->  00:07:21.318
So remember that I said in the beginning
162

162

00:07:21.318  -->  00:07:25.176
that this font size here is like for the usual text,
163

163

00:07:25.176  -->  00:07:26.499
for the normal text,
164

164

00:07:26.499  -->  00:07:28.218
and then for the headings we have like
165

165

00:07:28.218  -->  00:07:30.698
this different font family.
166

166

00:07:30.698  -->  00:07:33.396
And these ones here are actually H4 elements,
167

167

00:07:33.396  -->  00:07:37.027
and so I decided that these smaller headings are the H4s,
168

168

00:07:37.027  -->  00:07:39.777
so this one for example, and also this one,
169

169

00:07:39.777  -->  00:07:41.352
these are H4s,
170

170

00:07:41.352  -->  00:07:45.263
then this one slightly bigger is the H3.
171

171

00:07:45.263  -->  00:07:48.802
This one here of course is the H1.
172

172

00:07:48.802  -->  00:07:52.156
And then we also have this one, which is the H2.
173

173

00:07:52.156  -->  00:07:54.709
So I could have done that differently,
174

174

00:07:54.709  -->  00:07:57.446
but that's just up to you, how you do it in your project.
175

175

00:07:57.446  -->  00:08:01.086
So that's the hierarchy that I defined for the headings.
176

176

00:08:01.086  -->  00:08:05.253
So an SVG icon, an H4, and a paragraph with this text.
177

177

00:08:08.222  -->  00:08:09.972
So back in our xhtml,
178

178

00:08:11.763  -->  00:08:14.378
let's then get rid of this text here
179

179

00:08:14.378  -->  00:08:16.352
and start including the stuff here.
180

180

00:08:16.352  -->  00:08:17.764
So we start with the icon,
181

181

00:08:17.764  -->  00:08:20.179
and remember how we did that?
182

182

00:08:20.179  -->  00:08:22.307
So use the SVG element,
183

183

00:08:22.307  -->  00:08:25.974
and we're gonna call this one feature__icon,
184

184

00:08:27.633  -->  00:08:29.783
and then in there, remember that we have
185

185

00:08:29.783  -->  00:08:31.700
this weird use element,
186

186

00:08:32.751  -->  00:08:34.695
so let me actually write that out.
187

187

00:08:34.695  -->  00:08:37.445
And then we use xlink colon href.
188

188

00:08:42.144  -->  00:08:46.311
And then image, and it's simply called sprite, as before.
189

189

00:08:47.219  -->  00:08:50.163
And then in here we have the different icons,
190

190

00:08:50.163  -->  00:08:53.080
and this one is called icon-global,
191

191

00:08:55.142  -->  00:08:57.567
and so that's the one that looks like that globe.
192

192

00:08:57.567  -->  00:09:00.221
And let me actually show that to you,
193

193

00:09:00.221  -->  00:09:01.888
so image and sprite,
194

194

00:09:04.344  -->  00:09:06.485
so you cannot really see the image,
195

195

00:09:06.485  -->  00:09:08.139
but we can see the different names.
196

196

00:09:08.139  -->  00:09:12.130
So we have icon-presentation, or icon-heart-full,
197

197

00:09:12.130  -->  00:09:13.966
icon-expand, icon-lock,
198

198

00:09:13.966  -->  00:09:17.056
trophy, key, and so on and so forth.
199

199

00:09:17.056  -->  00:09:18.811
And you could probably open this also
200

200

00:09:18.811  -->  00:09:20.983
in some kind of graphical software
201

201

00:09:20.983  -->  00:09:23.907
in order to take a look at these different icons here,
202

202

00:09:23.907  -->  00:09:25.431
but I'm not gonna do that
203

203

00:09:25.431  -->  00:09:26.880
because I really just wanna quickly get
204

204

00:09:26.880  -->  00:09:28.630
my content into here.
205

205

00:09:29.827  -->  00:09:32.882
So next we have the H4 element,
206

206

00:09:32.882  -->  00:09:35.667
and this one is called heading-4, very simply.
207

207

00:09:35.667  -->  00:09:37.119
And so you see that I'm already using
208

208

00:09:37.119  -->  00:09:39.436
like a reusable style,
209

209

00:09:39.436  -->  00:09:42.250
and so this is like a component that I'm gonna reuse
210

210

00:09:42.250  -->  00:09:44.530
throughout the page later on.
211

211

00:09:44.530  -->  00:09:47.770
And so that's not really part of the feature block here,
212

212

00:09:47.770  -->  00:09:49.614
and the feature component itself.
213

213

00:09:49.614  -->  00:09:50.447
So,
214

214

00:09:51.924  -->  00:09:54.091
world's best luxury homes.
215

215

00:09:56.684  -->  00:09:58.844
So that's the heading for the first one,
216

216

00:09:58.844  -->  00:10:02.677
and then we have, of course, the feature text.
217

217

00:10:04.505  -->  00:10:06.362
Okay, and as for this content,
218

218

00:10:06.362  -->  00:10:08.597
here in the image folder, you will see
219

219

00:10:08.597  -->  00:10:11.298
a small text file, and so in here
220

220

00:10:11.298  -->  00:10:14.548
I have the text for these six elements.
221

221

00:10:16.116  -->  00:10:18.979
So let's take a look at that.
222

222

00:10:18.979  -->  00:10:21.297
And alright, we have our icon,
223

223

00:10:21.297  -->  00:10:24.178
we have our unstyled H4 and a p.
224

224

00:10:24.178  -->  00:10:25.329
So that's huge right now,
225

225

00:10:25.329  -->  00:10:28.183
but of course we're gonna take care of that later.
226

226

00:10:28.183  -->  00:10:32.501
For now, let's actually just copy this here five times,
227

227

00:10:32.501  -->  00:10:33.439
replace this one here,
228

228

00:10:33.439  -->  00:10:34.869
this was just for testing purposes,
229

229

00:10:34.869  -->  00:10:37.889
but now we just have this content
230

230

00:10:37.889  -->  00:10:41.368
and so we just have to replace then the stuff here.
231

231

00:10:41.368  -->  00:10:42.931
So this is one, two, three, four, five,
232

232

00:10:42.931  -->  00:10:45.812
I think one is missing, yeah.
233

233

00:10:45.812  -->  00:10:46.645
And okay.
234

234

00:10:47.581  -->  00:10:50.664
So the next one is called the trophy,
235

235

00:10:51.791  -->  00:10:54.091
it says then here,
236

236

00:10:54.091  -->  00:10:56.174
only the best properties,
237

237

00:10:58.155  -->  00:11:00.072
and let's get our text.
238

238

00:11:03.501  -->  00:11:05.164
Of course we could leave the same text here
239

239

00:11:05.164  -->  00:11:06.608
for all of these elements,
240

240

00:11:06.608  -->  00:11:09.378
but then it would look weird and not natural at all.
241

241

00:11:09.378  -->  00:11:11.216
And also I want to show you something that happens
242

242

00:11:11.216  -->  00:11:13.662
when we have different amount of text here, okay.
243

243

00:11:13.662  -->  00:11:17.021
And so it's really useful to have it like this.
244

244

00:11:17.021  -->  00:11:21.955
Okay, next up we have to replace the global in here.
245

245

00:11:21.955  -->  00:11:23.955
Change it to map-pin and
246

246

00:11:25.554  -->  00:11:28.887
here it says all homes in top locations.
247

247

00:11:35.547  -->  00:11:38.380
And then let's get the text again.
248

248

00:11:44.423  -->  00:11:45.840
This here is key.
249

249

00:11:48.954  -->  00:11:50.704
New home in one week.
250

250

00:12:05.361  -->  00:12:09.278
And only two to go.
So this one is presentation.
251

251

00:12:13.744  -->  00:12:15.494
Top 1% realtors.
252

252

00:12:24.731  -->  00:12:28.430
And finally, this one is with a lock
253

253

00:12:28.430  -->  00:12:29.347
and it says
254

254

00:12:33.280  -->  00:12:36.091
secure payments on nexter,
255

255

00:12:36.091  -->  00:12:38.341
so the name of the company.
256

256

00:12:45.284  -->  00:12:46.784
Let's take a look.
257

257

00:12:47.802  -->  00:12:49.377
And here we go.
258

258

00:12:49.377  -->  00:12:53.119
Okay, so that is our content ready to be styled.
259

259

00:12:53.119  -->  00:12:54.137
And we're actually gonna do that
260

260

00:12:54.137  -->  00:12:56.304
right in the next lecture.
