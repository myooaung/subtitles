00:00:01,336  -->  00:00:03,256
<v Lecturer>So here comes the more exciting part</v>
2

2

00:00:03,256  -->  00:00:04,948
of building this navigation.
3

3

00:00:04,948  -->  00:00:06,663
Which, this will actually make it work
4

4

00:00:06,663  -->  00:00:09,243
as soon as we hit that navigation button.
5

5

00:00:09,243  -->  00:00:10,743
So, let's do that.
6

6

00:00:11,611  -->  00:00:14,831
First of all, we need to hide this background here again
7

7

00:00:14,831  -->  00:00:18,063
and also hide this navigation, right?
8

8

00:00:18,063  -->  00:00:19,230
Let's do that.
9

9

00:00:21,774  -->  00:00:23,345
Where is this ... yeah, here.
10

10

00:00:23,345  -->  00:00:26,513
Remember, we didn't want this one here
11

11

00:00:26,513  -->  00:00:29,528
so let's make it disappear.
12

12

00:00:29,528  -->  00:00:31,918
And then here we have the button and actually
13

13

00:00:31,918  -->  00:00:35,774
we should add some shadows here, okay?
14

14

00:00:35,774  -->  00:00:39,357
A box shadow of one in the right direction,
15

15

00:00:40,841  -->  00:00:41,841
a nice blur,
16

16

00:00:43,264  -->  00:00:47,097
and in the color of, once again, black, right?
17

17

00:00:50,665  -->  00:00:53,832
Just a very subtle shadow here, right?
18

18

00:00:56,180  -->  00:00:58,347
That's what it looks like.
19

19

00:01:00,241  -->  00:01:01,924
And now, of course, we have to get rid
20

20

00:01:01,924  -->  00:01:04,678
of the navigation here as well.
21

21

00:01:04,678  -->  00:01:06,992
So, where is that?
22

22

00:01:06,992  -->  00:01:08,377
Yeah, this is the one.
23

23

00:01:08,377  -->  00:01:10,566
How are we going to do that?
24

24

00:01:10,566  -->  00:01:15,291
Well, we can use opacity zero, such as we did before.
25

25

00:01:15,291  -->  00:01:17,903
Now, there's a problem with that which is that
26

26

00:01:17,903  -->  00:01:21,327
with this alone, we will actually make it opaque,
27

27

00:01:21,327  -->  00:01:24,162
but you see that ... well, now I cannot show you.
28

28

00:01:24,162  -->  00:01:26,438
But the links, okay, they're still here.
29

29

00:01:26,438  -->  00:01:29,741
So you see that the hand is here at some of these places.
30

30

00:01:29,741  -->  00:01:33,295
So, they're invisible now, but they're still there.
31

31

00:01:33,295  -->  00:01:37,462
What we should do here, is to also set the width to a zero.
32

32

00:01:38,689  -->  00:01:42,555
Actually, we have it up here, so let's remove that.
33

33

00:01:42,555  -->  00:01:44,972
Now it should work just fine.
34

34

00:01:47,405  -->  00:01:48,732
The text is now gone.
35

35

00:01:48,732  -->  00:01:52,308
The only text we have here now is this H1 that we have.
36

36

00:01:52,308  -->  00:01:53,240
Okay?
37

37

00:01:53,240  -->  00:01:56,737
We hit the navigation and we hit background.
38

38

00:01:56,737  -->  00:01:58,043
Now, all we have to do is to actually
39

39

00:01:58,043  -->  00:02:00,234
bring them back to life.
40

40

00:02:00,234  -->  00:02:01,517
Let's say so.
41

41

00:02:01,517  -->  00:02:05,265
And so, this is where we use the check box hack.
42

42

00:02:05,265  -->  00:02:06,681
How do we do that?
43

43

00:02:06,681  -->  00:02:08,745
Remember from the booking lecture,
44

44

00:02:08,745  -->  00:02:11,177
where we did the radio buttons?
45

45

00:02:11,177  -->  00:02:12,871
This is very similar to that.
46

46

00:02:12,871  -->  00:02:16,223
We have our checkbox, we have our label,
47

47

00:02:16,223  -->  00:02:18,392
and we have our background.
48

48

00:02:18,392  -->  00:02:22,067
We hit the label and the checkbox becomes checked.
49

49

00:02:22,067  -->  00:02:24,803
Then we want the navigation background here
50

50

00:02:24,803  -->  00:02:26,397
to become visible.
51

51

00:02:26,397  -->  00:02:29,972
How do we translate that into a CSS selector?
52

52

00:02:29,972  -->  00:02:31,852
Well, it's actually not so hard.
53

53

00:02:31,852  -->  00:02:36,019
We just write checkbox and a checked pseudo-class again,
54

54

00:02:38,151  -->  00:02:40,313
just as we did with the radio button.
55

55

00:02:40,313  -->  00:02:42,973
And then use the sibling selector.
56

56

00:02:42,973  -->  00:02:44,122
Remember that one?
57

57

00:02:44,122  -->  00:02:46,313
Now this time, it's not an adjacent sibling,
58

58

00:02:46,313  -->  00:02:49,039
because it's not direct sibling, right?
59

59

00:02:49,039  -->  00:02:52,430
The one that we want to select here is now this one.
60

60

00:02:52,430  -->  00:02:55,872
So the adjacent sibling of the checked box would be this one
61

61

00:02:55,872  -->  00:02:57,429
but that's not the one that we want.
62

62

00:02:57,429  -->  00:02:58,450
We want this here.
63

63

00:02:58,450  -->  00:03:01,269
And so we just use the general sibling and then,
64

64

00:03:01,269  -->  00:03:04,173
with that, we will be able to select the right element.
65

65

00:03:04,173  -->  00:03:05,423
So, background.
66

66

00:03:06,673  -->  00:03:08,620
And that's actually it.
67

67

00:03:08,620  -->  00:03:11,379
Remember how we increase the size of this?
68

68

00:03:11,379  -->  00:03:13,712
We simply scale it 80 times.
69

69

00:03:15,036  -->  00:03:16,370
This is what we actually did.
70

70

00:03:16,370  -->  00:03:19,120
Okay, so let's see if that works.
71

71

00:03:20,416  -->  00:03:23,145
We hit this, and whoa, here we go.
72

72

00:03:23,145  -->  00:03:26,245
Now it disappears and it comes back and it appears
73

73

00:03:26,245  -->  00:03:28,747
and so it is working.
74

74

00:03:28,747  -->  00:03:30,147
Great, right?
75

75

00:03:30,147  -->  00:03:31,800
We don't have the animation yet in place,
76

76

00:03:31,800  -->  00:03:34,668
but we're going to take care of that in a second.
77

77

00:03:34,668  -->  00:03:38,775
For now, let's do the same for the navigation, okay?
78

78

00:03:38,775  -->  00:03:43,416
It's the same really and so all we have to do here is
79

79

00:03:43,416  -->  00:03:45,499
to replace it with "nav."
80

80

00:03:46,727  -->  00:03:49,887
And then, what happens here is, of course, that we remove
81

81

00:03:49,887  -->  00:03:51,425
what we did here before.
82

82

00:03:51,425  -->  00:03:53,514
The opacity is no longer zero
83

83

00:03:53,514  -->  00:03:56,847
and the width is no longer zero as well.
84

84

00:03:58,569  -->  00:04:01,486
Opacity one with back to 100%.
85

85

00:04:03,866  -->  00:04:06,033
Let's take a look at that,
86

86

00:04:07,380  -->  00:04:08,630
and here we go.
87

87

00:04:10,146  -->  00:04:13,646
It works, without animation, but it works.
88

88

00:04:14,535  -->  00:04:16,957
For the animation, this is also very simple.
89

89

00:04:16,957  -->  00:04:20,416
It's just the transition that we have used before.
90

90

00:04:20,416  -->  00:04:22,607
We need the transition on the background
91

91

00:04:22,607  -->  00:04:25,107
as well as on the nav element.
92

92

00:04:27,579  -->  00:04:31,706
Transition, and what we want to transition here
93

93

00:04:31,706  -->  00:04:34,596
is just to transform, so let's just put "transform" here
94

94

00:04:34,596  -->  00:04:36,771
instead of transitioning everything.
95

95

00:04:36,771  -->  00:04:40,787
And then, let's put a .8 second here, so a very long one.
96

96

00:04:40,787  -->  00:04:42,244
Now, this time around, we're going to add
97

97

00:04:42,244  -->  00:04:45,767
a custom transition time and function here.
98

98

00:04:45,767  -->  00:04:48,245
For now, let's just add the transition to the other element
99

99

00:04:48,245  -->  00:04:52,477
and just take a look how it looks like, okay?
100

100

00:04:52,477  -->  00:04:54,477
And so here, transition.
101

101

00:04:56,521  -->  00:04:58,092
And in here, we only want
102

102

00:04:58,092  -->  00:05:00,473
to really animate the opacity, okay?
103

103

00:05:00,473  -->  00:05:03,073
The width, it should be instantaneous.
104

104

00:05:03,073  -->  00:05:06,096
Instantly it should become 100%,
105

105

00:05:06,096  -->  00:05:07,923
but the opacity, that's the one
106

106

00:05:07,923  -->  00:05:09,634
that we actually want to animate.
107

107

00:05:09,634  -->  00:05:13,134
So we set the opacity and also .8 seconds.
108

108

00:05:14,712  -->  00:05:18,212
Alright and that should be enough already.
109

109

00:05:22,321  -->  00:05:25,583
Alright, well, actually, we have to animate the width
110

110

00:05:25,583  -->  00:05:29,660
as well because now you see it goes here to the side,
111

111

00:05:29,660  -->  00:05:31,743
in this weird way, right?
112

112

00:05:32,928  -->  00:05:35,595
Let's put it here to all, right?
113

113

00:05:40,923  -->  00:05:43,527
Well, now you see this is like weirdly moving
114

114

00:05:43,527  -->  00:05:46,927
in from the side and moving out like this, okay?
115

115

00:05:46,927  -->  00:05:49,197
And that's not at all what we want to happen,
116

116

00:05:49,197  -->  00:05:52,380
but I believe this is because we didn't specify a width
117

117

00:05:52,380  -->  00:05:55,880
here for this element for this list, okay?
118

118

00:05:58,147  -->  00:06:01,979
If we set this to 100%, then that should not be happening.
119

119

00:06:01,979  -->  00:06:06,146
So, navigation list, okay, and we say width 100%.
120

120

00:06:13,329  -->  00:06:14,829
Let's reload that.
121

121

00:06:17,897  -->  00:06:20,364
Well, and it actually makes sense that this is happening
122

122

00:06:20,364  -->  00:06:22,138
because remember, when we closed this,
123

123

00:06:22,138  -->  00:06:26,043
this entire container here reduces its width from 100%
124

124

00:06:26,043  -->  00:06:28,967
so everything, all until the way to zero.
125

125

00:06:28,967  -->  00:06:31,695
Since we fix it here at the right side,
126

126

00:06:31,695  -->  00:06:35,527
then this thing here also moves to the right side, okay?
127

127

00:06:35,527  -->  00:06:38,271
Let me demonstrate that to you.
128

128

00:06:38,271  -->  00:06:41,094
First of all, let's put it to left here, okay?
129

129

00:06:41,094  -->  00:06:42,624
We want this to move to the left.
130

130

00:06:42,624  -->  00:06:45,634
At least that will make it look a bit better.
131

131

00:06:45,634  -->  00:06:49,861
And then background color, and you can guess it,
132

132

00:06:49,861  -->  00:06:50,861
orange, red.
133

133

00:06:53,303  -->  00:06:56,303
Let's take a look at that right now.
134

134

00:07:00,328  -->  00:07:02,445
This is what happens, you saw?
135

135

00:07:02,445  -->  00:07:04,472
Now when I hit this button, you will see this orange here
136

136

00:07:04,472  -->  00:07:06,057
moving to that side.
137

137

00:07:06,057  -->  00:07:09,236
Therefore, since this here's always centered
138

138

00:07:09,236  -->  00:07:12,986
in this container, it will move to that side.
139

139

00:07:15,486  -->  00:07:16,569
You saw that?
140

140

00:07:17,731  -->  00:07:20,648
Okay, and so, that's what happened.
141

141

00:07:21,681  -->  00:07:23,469
But that's actually not a big problem
142

142

00:07:23,469  -->  00:07:25,355
because, basically, this automatically gives us
143

143

00:07:25,355  -->  00:07:27,621
a nice animation effect, right?
144

144

00:07:27,621  -->  00:07:30,258
This box moving in like that.
145

145

00:07:30,258  -->  00:07:32,388
Now, I promised you that we would take care
146

146

00:07:32,388  -->  00:07:35,720
of a custom transition timing function, okay?
147

147

00:07:35,720  -->  00:07:38,251
Here and here as well.
148

148

00:07:38,251  -->  00:07:39,901
Let's now do that.
149

149

00:07:39,901  -->  00:07:41,773
We saw in other lectures, that there are a bunch
150

150

00:07:41,773  -->  00:07:44,763
of built-in transition timing functions like ease-in
151

151

00:07:44,763  -->  00:07:47,802
or ease-out or ease-in-out, but this time,
152

152

00:07:47,802  -->  00:07:49,993
we want to use a more custom one.
153

153

00:07:49,993  -->  00:07:51,792
For that one, we use something
154

154

00:07:51,792  -->  00:07:54,792
called cubic-bezier functions, okay?
155

155

00:07:56,015  -->  00:07:58,691
Now, in here, we have to put four numbers that define
156

156

00:07:58,691  -->  00:08:01,323
the cubic-bezier curve, but since we don't really know
157

157

00:08:01,323  -->  00:08:03,994
which numbers to put, there is a nice tool
158

158

00:08:03,994  -->  00:08:05,991
which can help us with that.
159

159

00:08:05,991  -->  00:08:10,014
Actually two tools because this one and this one.
160

160

00:08:10,014  -->  00:08:13,952
Here are a bunch of different functions that we can use.
161

161

00:08:13,952  -->  00:08:16,297
Again, what an easing function is, is basically
162

162

00:08:16,297  -->  00:08:19,363
a function that specifies how much change occurs
163

163

00:08:19,363  -->  00:08:21,154
over time, okay?
164

164

00:08:21,154  -->  00:08:22,708
And that's exactly what this is here.
165

165

00:08:22,708  -->  00:08:25,626
Take a look at these red markers.
166

166

00:08:25,626  -->  00:08:27,723
This one started slow, accelerated, and then
167

167

00:08:27,723  -->  00:08:29,029
slowed down again.
168

168

00:08:29,029  -->  00:08:30,405
Take a look again.
169

169

00:08:30,405  -->  00:08:33,614
This one here mixes even more, and even more in here,
170

170

00:08:33,614  -->  00:08:34,576
you saw?
171

171

00:08:34,576  -->  00:08:38,025
Really slow beginning then really fast, you see this here,
172

172

00:08:38,025  -->  00:08:39,854
and then really slow.
173

173

00:08:39,854  -->  00:08:43,653
Then we have these ones here, something like this.
174

174

00:08:43,653  -->  00:08:45,352
But for now, let's use this one here, okay?
175

175

00:08:45,352  -->  00:08:48,405
I really like this one, so we're going to use that
176

176

00:08:48,405  -->  00:08:49,238
for the background.
177

177

00:08:49,238  -->  00:08:51,622
We can just click this here and then all we have to do,
178

178

00:08:51,622  -->  00:08:53,455
is to copy this curve.
179

179

00:08:55,419  -->  00:08:58,269
You put it here, or actually, we only need the numbers,
180

180

00:08:58,269  -->  00:09:01,102
already wrote the function and so,
181

181

00:09:02,525  -->  00:09:03,746
we just need the numbers.
182

182

00:09:03,746  -->  00:09:07,746
And now, let's take a look at how it looks like.
183

183

00:09:10,775  -->  00:09:13,951
Well, that was different, right?
184

184

00:09:13,951  -->  00:09:16,228
Just as an example, it comes really easy
185

185

00:09:16,228  -->  00:09:19,445
and then it accelerates like crazy.
186

186

00:09:19,445  -->  00:09:20,528
You saw that?
187

187

00:09:22,222  -->  00:09:23,391
Let's stick with that.
188

188

00:09:23,391  -->  00:09:25,699
Of course, you can use other functions.
189

189

00:09:25,699  -->  00:09:28,720
If you like another one more, use that.
190

190

00:09:28,720  -->  00:09:31,129
Just to have this more visually,
191

191

00:09:31,129  -->  00:09:33,312
this is how these functions actually work,
192

192

00:09:33,312  -->  00:09:34,339
so these numbers.
193

193

00:09:34,339  -->  00:09:38,373
If we push this here, or pull them down,
194

194

00:09:38,373  -->  00:09:40,150
then we have something like this.
195

195

00:09:40,150  -->  00:09:43,230
This is a bit similar to the function that we have, right?
196

196

00:09:43,230  -->  00:09:44,800
Well, maybe not exactly like this.
197

197

00:09:44,800  -->  00:09:46,879
I'm not sure it doesn't really matter.
198

198

00:09:46,879  -->  00:09:48,628
But in here, we can then compare
199

199

00:09:48,628  -->  00:09:51,852
these cubic-bezier functions that we draw here,
200

200

00:09:51,852  -->  00:09:53,970
with one of the built-in ones, okay?
201

201

00:09:53,970  -->  00:09:56,826
If we hit on "go," then the pink one is the one
202

202

00:09:56,826  -->  00:10:00,773
that be routing here and the blue one is the built-in.
203

203

00:10:00,773  -->  00:10:04,365
For example, they're easing out, let's say.
204

204

00:10:04,365  -->  00:10:06,947
If we compare it with this one,
205

205

00:10:06,947  -->  00:10:09,210
then you see this one is really slow at the beginning
206

206

00:10:09,210  -->  00:10:11,450
and at the end, but then it's really fast.
207

207

00:10:11,450  -->  00:10:14,726
That's like this huge slope that you see here going on.
208

208

00:10:14,726  -->  00:10:17,952
Now if you did it the other way around, something like this,
209

209

00:10:17,952  -->  00:10:22,119
you'll now see that this will accelerate pretty fast,
210

210

00:10:23,332  -->  00:10:26,639
then it will slow down, move actually back a bit,
211

211

00:10:26,639  -->  00:10:29,561
and then become really fast again at the end.
212

212

00:10:29,561  -->  00:10:31,181
Let's take a look.
213

213

00:10:31,181  -->  00:10:33,286
You saw that moving back, it was this part here.
214

214

00:10:33,286  -->  00:10:36,002
From here to here, it moved back and then really fast
215

215

00:10:36,002  -->  00:10:36,885
at the end.
216

216

00:10:36,885  -->  00:10:38,923
Let's take a look again.
217

217

00:10:38,923  -->  00:10:39,923
There it is.
218

218

00:10:40,815  -->  00:10:43,729
Yeah, you can really play around with this.
219

219

00:10:43,729  -->  00:10:48,041
Now this will be even more dramatic, okay?
220

220

00:10:48,041  -->  00:10:51,710
That's a lot of different functions that we can draw
221

221

00:10:51,710  -->  00:10:54,138
basically with this.
222

222

00:10:54,138  -->  00:10:56,308
Let's take a look now at this one, for example.
223

223

00:10:56,308  -->  00:10:58,971
I really like to play around with this.
224

224

00:10:58,971  -->  00:11:00,932
Now, in this case, we already have
225

225

00:11:00,932  -->  00:11:04,422
these pretty fine functions here, which are pretty great,
226

226

00:11:04,422  -->  00:11:07,202
but you can always, if you want, play around with this one.
227

227

00:11:07,202  -->  00:11:11,182
Now, for navigation itself, let's add another function.
228

228

00:11:11,182  -->  00:11:13,906
What I'm going to use is this one.
229

229

00:11:13,906  -->  00:11:15,874
This one, as you can already see here,
230

230

00:11:15,874  -->  00:11:18,374
it will move out a little bit.
231

231

00:11:21,044  -->  00:11:22,500
Let's actually copy the entire thing here now.
232

232

00:11:22,500  -->  00:11:26,000
Because in here we haven't put it already.
233

233

00:11:28,343  -->  00:11:31,676
Alright, let's take a look now, refresh.
234

234

00:11:34,023  -->  00:11:35,120
And here we go.
235

235

00:11:35,120  -->  00:11:38,086
Now you saw that it actually moved a bit to that side first,
236

236

00:11:38,086  -->  00:11:39,611
so to the right side.
237

237

00:11:39,611  -->  00:11:40,798
Why did that happen?
238

238

00:11:40,798  -->  00:11:44,965
Well, simply because this width, this 100% width here,
239

239

00:11:46,885  -->  00:11:50,924
it got a bit larger, so it got maybe 110% because
240

240

00:11:50,924  -->  00:11:52,336
of this curve.
241

241

00:11:52,336  -->  00:11:56,503
Because the curve here actually comes out of this one here,
242

242

00:11:58,117  -->  00:12:02,200
let's say, so we have something like this, right?
243

243

00:12:06,683  -->  00:12:10,129
You will see that this now will probably move a bit
244

244

00:12:10,129  -->  00:12:14,405
out here, like this actually, so you saw it's moved a bit
245

245

00:12:14,405  -->  00:12:15,846
in this direction, then it came back.
246

246

00:12:15,846  -->  00:12:19,071
That's because this here is higher than the 100%.
247

247

00:12:19,071  -->  00:12:21,738
Actually it says here 105%.
248

248

00:12:23,152  -->  00:12:24,294
You can see it here as well.
249

249

00:12:24,294  -->  00:12:26,721
It says, "This curve contains values out of range."
250

250

00:12:26,721  -->  00:12:28,956
That makes for this effect,
251

251

00:12:28,956  -->  00:12:30,727
which can be really cool sometimes.
252

252

00:12:30,727  -->  00:12:34,579
In this case, I think it looks good, and so,
253

253

00:12:34,579  -->  00:12:35,785
let's keep it that way.
254

254

00:12:35,785  -->  00:12:38,140
Of course, I invite you to play around with this,
255

255

00:12:38,140  -->  00:12:42,307
get your own style maybe, and play around with this, okay?
256

256

00:12:44,418  -->  00:12:46,376
Alright, so this is already pretty similar
257

257

00:12:46,376  -->  00:12:48,656
to what we have here.
258

258

00:12:48,656  -->  00:12:52,367
All that's left to do, it to create this button here.
259

259

00:12:52,367  -->  00:12:56,640
These three lines which open and close and close and open.
260

260

00:12:56,640  -->  00:12:57,542
Okay?
261

261

00:12:57,542  -->  00:12:59,758
That's actually a bit more complex than it looks like,
262

262

00:12:59,758  -->  00:13:02,547
and so we're going to leave that for the next lecture.
263

263

00:13:02,547  -->  00:13:04,943
If you want to know how to do it, don't take a break,
264

264

00:13:04,943  -->  00:13:07,585
and come right with me, okay?
265

265

00:13:07,585  -->  00:13:09,252
See you in a second.
