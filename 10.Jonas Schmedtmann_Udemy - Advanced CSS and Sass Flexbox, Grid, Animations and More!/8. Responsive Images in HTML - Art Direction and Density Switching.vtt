00:00:01.239  -->  00:00:03.886
<v Narrator>So after hearing about the different use cases</v>
2

2

00:00:03.886  -->  00:00:06.040
for responsive images, let's now implement
3

3

00:00:06.040  -->  00:00:10.194
density switching in art direction in HTML.
4

4

00:00:10.194  -->  00:00:12.211
In this lecture, you will learn how to use
5

5

00:00:12.211  -->  00:00:14.881
the source set attribute on the image and
6

6

00:00:14.881  -->  00:00:18.985
source HTML elements together with density descriptors.
7

7

00:00:18.985  -->  00:00:22.425
And also how and why to use the picture element for
8

8

00:00:22.425  -->  00:00:26.259
art direction with media queries in HTML.
9

9

00:00:26.259  -->  00:00:29.741
So this lecture will be about responsive images in HTML.
10

10

00:00:29.741  -->  00:00:33.736
Now what's the difference between images in HTML and in CSS?
11

11

00:00:33.736  -->  00:00:37.207
Well basically, with images in HTML, I simply mean all the
12

12

00:00:37.207  -->  00:00:39.669
IMG text, so all the image text, where we specify
13

13

00:00:39.669  -->  00:00:41.491
a source for the image.
14

14

00:00:41.491  -->  00:00:43.825
So for example, here this logo that we have here
15

15

00:00:43.825  -->  00:00:47.022
this is an image, then these three images here
16

16

00:00:47.022  -->  00:00:49.920
we also specify them in the HTML.
17

17

00:00:49.920  -->  00:00:53.688
Then, these here I think are also images
18

18

00:00:53.688  -->  00:00:56.010
and then also this logo.
19

19

00:00:56.010  -->  00:00:57.693
So that's images in HTML.
20

20

00:00:57.693  -->  00:01:00.909
And in CSS of course, it's when we use background image.
21

21

00:01:00.909  -->  00:01:02.576
So such as this one,
22

22

00:01:04.112  -->  00:01:06.699
these ones here, so they are also background images.
23

23

00:01:06.699  -->  00:01:08.080
And so that's a difference.
24

24

00:01:08.080  -->  00:01:10.687
So for these images here we will use CSS.
25

25

00:01:10.687  -->  00:01:12.939
For responsive images and for the other ones,
26

26

00:01:12.939  -->  00:01:15.257
we will do stuff in HTML.
27

27

00:01:15.257  -->  00:01:17.354
So I'm starting with HTML because there are actually
28

28

00:01:17.354  -->  00:01:20.982
more technologies for doing responsive images in HTML.
29

29

00:01:20.982  -->  00:01:24.134
And the one we're going to use this on is for now,
30

30

00:01:24.134  -->  00:01:25.200
this one here, okay?
31

31

00:01:25.200  -->  00:01:28.353
So we're going to do art direction and density switching
32

32

00:01:28.353  -->  00:01:31.058
on this logo down here in the footer.
33

33

00:01:31.058  -->  00:01:33.221
So, how do we do that?
34

34

00:01:33.221  -->  00:01:35.377
And I'm going to start with density switching
35

35

00:01:35.377  -->  00:01:38.117
because that's actually the most simple one.
36

36

00:01:38.117  -->  00:01:41.087
So remember the philosophy behind density switching.
37

37

00:01:41.087  -->  00:01:43.300
Basically, what we're going to do is to serve
38

38

00:01:43.300  -->  00:01:46.533
a larger version of the same image for high resolution
39

39

00:01:46.533  -->  00:01:49.819
screens and serve a smaller version of the same image
40

40

00:01:49.819  -->  00:01:52.592
for a low density screen, right?
41

41

00:01:52.592  -->  00:01:54.870
And so basically, we need to have two images,
42

42

00:01:54.870  -->  00:01:57.142
one for each of the resolutions.
43

43

00:01:57.142  -->  00:02:00.718
And actually I do have that so let's take a look.
44

44

00:02:00.718  -->  00:02:02.718
So logo green 1x and 2x.
45

45

00:02:03.859  -->  00:02:04.942
So 1x and 2x.
46

46

00:02:05.851  -->  00:02:06.743
Right now this is the one that
47

47

00:02:06.743  -->  00:02:10.910
we're using, so 2x and that has 300 pixels in width.
48

48

00:02:12.028  -->  00:02:15.662
So let's just take a look at this one here.
49

49

00:02:15.662  -->  00:02:18.497
So here you see, it's the 2x and here in the dev tools,
50

50

00:02:18.497  -->  00:02:21.071
you can also see that the natural size of the image here
51

51

00:02:21.071  -->  00:02:23.323
is 300 pixels, right?
52

52

00:02:23.323  -->  00:02:25.895
So what I showed you in the code editor but that it's
53

53

00:02:25.895  -->  00:02:30.040
displaying with only 150 pixels here on the screen, okay?
54

54

00:02:30.040  -->  00:02:31.388
And that makes sense because that's actually the
55

55

00:02:31.388  -->  00:02:35.893
width that we specified over here in 15 rem, right?
56

56

00:02:35.893  -->  00:02:39.313
So it makes sense that the 2x image has exactly double
57

57

00:02:39.313  -->  00:02:41.797
the width of the width that it is
58

58

00:02:41.797  -->  00:02:43.717
displayed on the screen, right?
59

59

00:02:43.717  -->  00:02:47.300
Because high resolution screens use two physical pixels
60

60

00:02:47.300  -->  00:02:50.240
to display one display in our design, okay?
61

61

00:02:50.240  -->  00:02:52.531
So that's what we talked about in the last lecture.
62

62

00:02:52.531  -->  00:02:54.948
This is just a recap of that.
63

63

00:02:55.796  -->  00:02:57.314
So this is the 2x image
64

64

00:02:57.314  -->  00:02:59.152
and this is the one that we want to display
65

65

00:02:59.152  -->  00:03:02.712
on low resolution screens, the 1x image, okay?
66

66

00:03:02.712  -->  00:03:06.515
And so you see here that it has a width of only 150 pixels.
67

67

00:03:06.515  -->  00:03:08.190
So, how do we do that?
68

68

00:03:08.190  -->  00:03:11.043
Well, we can keep using the image element, we just
69

69

00:03:11.043  -->  00:03:15.786
have to change the source attribute to source set, okay?
70

70

00:03:15.786  -->  00:03:18.518
And so now we can specify two images.
71

71

00:03:18.518  -->  00:03:22.119
And the first one I'm going to specify is image
72

72

00:03:22.119  -->  00:03:25.620
logo green 1x and now we can put here something
73

73

00:03:25.620  -->  00:03:28.296
called a density descriptor, okay?
74

74

00:03:28.296  -->  00:03:30.461
And a density descriptor is very simple.
75

75

00:03:30.461  -->  00:03:33.919
I'll just write 1x for this one here
76

76

00:03:33.919  -->  00:03:36.002
and then 2x for this one.
77

77

00:03:37.235  -->  00:03:39.499
So now this source set attribute here allows
78

78

00:03:39.499  -->  00:03:43.371
the browser to choose the best of these two images here,
79

79

00:03:43.371  -->  00:03:46.428
so this one and this one, according to the screen
80

80

00:03:46.428  -->  00:03:49.455
that is used by the user to display the webpage.
81

81

00:03:49.455  -->  00:03:52.342
So if it's a low density screen, it will use this image
82

82

00:03:52.342  -->  00:03:54.844
here, okay, because we said that this image
83

83

00:03:54.844  -->  00:03:57.461
should be used for a low resolution screen
84

84

00:03:57.461  -->  00:04:00.028
and when a device has a high resolution screen,
85

85

00:04:00.028  -->  00:04:02.977
then it will use this image because we said so,
86

86

00:04:02.977  -->  00:04:06.448
because we said that this image should be used for
87

87

00:04:06.448  -->  00:04:07.395
high resolution.
88

88

00:04:07.395  -->  00:04:10.591
So that's the 2x density descriptor for that.
89

89

00:04:10.591  -->  00:04:11.754
And that's actually it.
90

90

00:04:11.754  -->  00:04:14.174
So with this image, with this source set attribute,
91

91

00:04:14.174  -->  00:04:16.624
we give the browser the choice to choose
92

92

00:04:16.624  -->  00:04:19.124
the best image for each situation.
93

93

00:04:19.124  -->  00:04:21.291
Now the results of this are a bit difficult to
94

94

00:04:21.291  -->  00:04:24.385
demonstrate here in the browser, okay?
95

95

00:04:24.385  -->  00:04:27.443
So what we see here happening, is that it says here
96

96

00:04:27.443  -->  00:04:31.635
now current source and then we see that it's logo green 2x
97

97

00:04:31.635  -->  00:04:34.067
and that's because I'm using a high resolution screen here
98

98

00:04:34.067  -->  00:04:36.111
but if you're using a low resolution screen,
99

99

00:04:36.111  -->  00:04:40.109
then it will probably say logo green 1x for you, okay?
100

100

00:04:40.109  -->  00:04:41.967
And if you then wanted this to work on a high
101

101

00:04:41.967  -->  00:04:44.340
resolution screen, well then you need a device to
102

102

00:04:44.340  -->  00:04:46.337
actually test this out, okay?
103

103

00:04:46.337  -->  00:04:49.451
So with this we just have to really trust that it's going
104

104

00:04:49.451  -->  00:04:53.066
to work as long as we do everything in the correct way,
105

105

00:04:53.066  -->  00:04:53.899
okay?
106

106

00:04:53.899  -->  00:04:56.503
So this is density switching in HTML
107

107

00:04:56.503  -->  00:05:00.427
and that's the most easiest use case for responsive images.
108

108

00:05:00.427  -->  00:05:03.291
Now, next up, we want to do art direction.
109

109

00:05:03.291  -->  00:05:05.119
And remember what that is?
110

110

00:05:05.119  -->  00:05:07.686
Well, what we want to do with art direction is
111

111

00:05:07.686  -->  00:05:10.679
to tell the browser to use one image on one screen width
112

112

00:05:10.679  -->  00:05:13.973
and another image on another screen width, okay?
113

113

00:05:13.973  -->  00:05:17.653
So we want to make images depend on the screen width.
114

114

00:05:17.653  -->  00:05:20.892
And the solution for that is to use an HTML element
115

115

00:05:20.892  -->  00:05:22.642
called picture, okay?
116

116

00:05:24.391  -->  00:05:28.288
And actually this is where I'm going to put this
117

117

00:05:28.288  -->  00:05:31.532
class now, this footer logo class.
118

118

00:05:31.532  -->  00:05:33.512
So I want this to be here right now.
119

119

00:05:33.512  -->  00:05:37.599
So that will now be our image basically, okay?
120

120

00:05:37.599  -->  00:05:39.972
And what do we have inside of the picture?
121

121

00:05:39.972  -->  00:05:42.850
First off, we have to specify a source element
122

122

00:05:42.850  -->  00:05:46.585
and we have to specify an image as well.
123

123

00:05:46.585  -->  00:05:48.744
And these are basically the different options that
124

124

00:05:48.744  -->  00:05:52.060
we're going to give the browser for images to display.
125

125

00:05:52.060  -->  00:05:55.371
Now we always have to use at least one image here
126

126

00:05:55.371  -->  00:05:57.043
and zero or more sources.
127

127

00:05:57.043  -->  00:05:58.931
But zero sources doesn't make any sense
128

128

00:05:58.931  -->  00:06:02.200
so we want at least one source and then followed by an image
129

129

00:06:02.200  -->  00:06:03.979
which is basically the fallback.
130

130

00:06:03.979  -->  00:06:08.146
And the image that we want is actually this one, okay?
131

131

00:06:09.029  -->  00:06:12.259
And now we can do something very similar with the source.
132

132

00:06:12.259  -->  00:06:15.842
So once again we can use source set in here
133

133

00:06:17.574  -->  00:06:20.115
and then the media attribute and that is
134

134

00:06:20.115  -->  00:06:22.607
where the real magic happens here, okay?
135

135

00:06:22.607  -->  00:06:23.740
So in the media attribute,
136

136

00:06:23.740  -->  00:06:27.574
we can basically put a CSS media query, okay?
137

137

00:06:27.574  -->  00:06:30.557
So let's start by doing that and let's actually use
138

138

00:06:30.557  -->  00:06:33.754
the one that we used in our design as well.
139

139

00:06:33.754  -->  00:06:37.274
So I'm going to use this one for the phone, okay?
140

140

00:06:37.274  -->  00:06:39.427
So we want the art direction to happen
141

141

00:06:39.427  -->  00:06:42.010
at the breakpoint of the phone.
142

142

00:06:44.129  -->  00:06:46.586
Okay, and that's the way that we do it.
143

143

00:06:46.586  -->  00:06:50.079
So we specified the max width of 600 pixels
144

144

00:06:50.079  -->  00:06:54.136
in the this case, so this one here means 600 pixels.
145

145

00:06:54.136  -->  00:06:56.873
And then we say the image that we want here
146

146

00:06:56.873  -->  00:07:00.089
in case that the width is lower than 600 pixels,
147

147

00:07:00.089  -->  00:07:03.089
so just like in media queries, okay?
148

148

00:07:04.192  -->  00:07:06.678
Alright, so what do we put here?
149

149

00:07:06.678  -->  00:07:08.912
Well, logo green small.
150

150

00:07:08.912  -->  00:07:11.101
Let me just show that to you.
151

151

00:07:11.101  -->  00:07:14.439
So we have logo green small and once again we have
152

152

00:07:14.439  -->  00:07:17.022
the 1x version so this one here
153

153

00:07:19.064  -->  00:07:21.774
and we have the 2x version, okay?
154

154

00:07:21.774  -->  00:07:25.130
And so we can actually do that same thing as we did before
155

155

00:07:25.130  -->  00:07:28.000
so we can use our density descriptors again
156

156

00:07:28.000  -->  00:07:30.482
so we say that if it's a low resolution screen,
157

157

00:07:30.482  -->  00:07:33.846
we want to use this small image here with 1x
158

158

00:07:33.846  -->  00:07:36.499
and if it's a high resolution screen,
159

159

00:07:36.499  -->  00:07:38.666
and let me just copy this,
160

160

00:07:42.078  -->  00:07:44.782
then we want a high resolution image,
161

161

00:07:44.782  -->  00:07:47.494
so the larger image in that case.
162

162

00:07:47.494  -->  00:07:49.911
Okay, and that's actually it.
163

163

00:07:51.192  -->  00:07:53.427
So let's recap what we're doing here.
164

164

00:07:53.427  -->  00:07:55.533
We started by using the picture element
165

165

00:07:55.533  -->  00:07:57.726
in which we can basically specify
166

166

00:07:57.726  -->  00:08:00.131
multiple sources for one image
167

167

00:08:00.131  -->  00:08:02.230
and then in the source element, we can actually
168

168

00:08:02.230  -->  00:08:05.828
write a media query just like we do in CSS.
169

169

00:08:05.828  -->  00:08:08.491
And so with this we force the browser to
170

170

00:08:08.491  -->  00:08:12.835
use this image source set here, this image source set
171

171

00:08:12.835  -->  00:08:16.752
in case that max width is less than 600 pixels,
172

172

00:08:17.706  -->  00:08:20.813
and in case it's not, so if it's larger than 600 pixels,
173

173

00:08:20.813  -->  00:08:24.776
then the browser is forced to use this image source set.
174

174

00:08:24.776  -->  00:08:26.564
So that is called art direction,
175

175

00:08:26.564  -->  00:08:30.457
Different images for different viewport width, alright?
176

176

00:08:30.457  -->  00:08:33.645
Now then inside each of these sources, we then do
177

177

00:08:33.645  -->  00:08:35.842
density switching and that's why we're using the
178

178

00:08:35.842  -->  00:08:38.929
source set attribute instead of the source attribute.
179

179

00:08:38.929  -->  00:08:41.734
And so here we give the browser a choice to use
180

180

00:08:41.734  -->  00:08:44.573
either the high resolution or low resolution image
181

181

00:08:44.573  -->  00:08:48.340
according to the screen which the webpage is viewed on.
182

182

00:08:48.340  -->  00:08:50.257
So let's test that out.
183

183

00:08:52.003  -->  00:08:55.050
And this one here, we will actually be able to see
184

184

00:08:55.050  -->  00:08:57.463
at least if everything's working fine.
185

185

00:08:57.463  -->  00:08:59.363
So let's decrease and alright.
186

186

00:08:59.363  -->  00:09:03.055
So we reached our 600 pixel breakpoint here
187

187

00:09:03.055  -->  00:09:05.145
and so now we have the small image here.
188

188

00:09:05.145  -->  00:09:06.687
So, perfect.
189

189

00:09:06.687  -->  00:09:08.797
And so now, as you hover here, this image,
190

190

00:09:08.797  -->  00:09:11.629
you can see that the current source, well it doesn't move,
191

191

00:09:11.629  -->  00:09:13.281
okay, but it says that the current source
192

192

00:09:13.281  -->  00:09:15.659
is logo green small 2x
193

193

00:09:15.659  -->  00:09:18.505
and that's exactly what we want to happen, right?
194

194

00:09:18.505  -->  00:09:19.532
So, perfect.
195

195

00:09:19.532  -->  00:09:22.103
We could now of course go ahead and add another source
196

196

00:09:22.103  -->  00:09:24.501
element with another media query here
197

197

00:09:24.501  -->  00:09:27.636
and then add more and more different versions of the image.
198

198

00:09:27.636  -->  00:09:30.344
But I don't believe that to be necessary.
199

199

00:09:30.344  -->  00:09:32.227
So that is this image here which
200

200

00:09:32.227  -->  00:09:34.095
is now working just fine so we just
201

201

00:09:34.095  -->  00:09:36.081
implemented the responsive images here,
202

202

00:09:36.081  -->  00:09:38.380
which is really great and we didn't have
203

203

00:09:38.380  -->  00:09:40.304
more images to work up on.
204

204

00:09:40.304  -->  00:09:44.248
Now these ones here, I'm not going to do them, okay?
205

205

00:09:44.248  -->  00:09:46.116
Because once again, this is more to show you
206

206

00:09:46.116  -->  00:09:49.132
all of the technology and not to waste time
207

207

00:09:49.132  -->  00:09:52.424
optimizing every single aspect of the page.
208

208

00:09:52.424  -->  00:09:54.591
What I'm going to do though in the next lecture
209

209

00:09:54.591  -->  00:09:58.045
is to apply responsive images to these three images
210

210

00:09:58.045  -->  00:10:00.824
and by then, we're going to use resolution switching
211

211

00:10:00.824  -->  00:10:03.211
instead of art direction because we do that
212

212

00:10:03.211  -->  00:10:05.028
in a slightly different way.
213

213

00:10:05.028  -->  00:10:07.559
So that's what we're going to do next and so let's
214

214

00:10:07.559  -->  00:10:10.226
now move on to the next lecture.
