1

00:00:00,865  -->  00:00:02,149
<v Jonas>This is the second part</v>
2

2

00:00:02,149  -->  00:00:04,899
of building the features section.
3

3

00:00:05,812  -->  00:00:08,262
This is where we left off after the last lecture.
4

4

00:00:08,262  -->  00:00:12,529
Now it's time to actually style these icons, this heading,
5

5

00:00:12,529  -->  00:00:13,770
and the paragraph.
6

6

00:00:13,770  -->  00:00:15,122
After we're done doing that,
7

7

00:00:15,122  -->  00:00:19,022
we will then lay them out here in this way.
8

8

00:00:19,022  -->  00:00:20,414
So the icon here on this side,
9

9

00:00:20,414  -->  00:00:23,892
and then these two, one after the other, okay?
10

10

00:00:23,892  -->  00:00:27,142
But let's start by styling these three.
11

11

00:00:28,976  -->  00:00:31,543
We have the icon, and the text,
12

12

00:00:31,543  -->  00:00:34,210
and then the heading separately.
13

13

00:00:36,258  -->  00:00:37,925
So we have features,
14

14

00:00:39,335  -->  00:00:41,226
and then we have the feature.
15

15

00:00:41,226  -->  00:00:43,616
This feature component here would, in theory,
16

16

00:00:43,616  -->  00:00:46,287
be reusable in another page.
17

17

00:00:46,287  -->  00:00:49,812
So it's completely independent from the features class.
18

18

00:00:49,812  -->  00:00:52,084
But I still put them in the same file though
19

19

00:00:52,084  -->  00:00:54,149
because they are closely related.
20

20

00:00:54,149  -->  00:00:56,321
Having these classes in different files
21

21

00:00:56,321  -->  00:00:59,894
would make me jump around a lot through the different files.
22

22

00:00:59,894  -->  00:01:04,300
That would be terrible for recording videos like this.
23

23

00:01:04,300  -->  00:01:07,901
Basically each of the section now got its own file.
24

24

00:01:07,901  -->  00:01:10,863
And then there, I have the overall element,
25

25

00:01:10,863  -->  00:01:13,738
which is like the container of these components.
26

26

00:01:13,738  -->  00:01:17,234
But again, this feature here would be completely reusable
27

27

00:01:17,234  -->  00:01:19,734
somewhere else later on the page,
28

28

00:01:19,734  -->  00:01:23,650
or if I had another page on my website.
29

29

00:01:23,650  -->  00:01:25,400
Let's style the icon,
30

30

00:01:28,459  -->  00:01:31,376
and then let's also style the text.
31

31

00:01:32,848  -->  00:01:36,085
Actually let's start with the text.
32

32

00:01:36,085  -->  00:01:39,002
Let's set the font size to 1.7 rem.
33

33

00:01:39,949  -->  00:01:41,282
That's it.
34

34

00:01:41,282  -->  00:01:42,863
Actually we don't have to do anything else,
35

35

00:01:42,863  -->  00:01:45,613
just increasing the font size here a bit.
36

36

00:01:45,613  -->  00:01:48,689
Then as for the icon, let's change the color.
37

37

00:01:48,689  -->  00:01:52,179
Remember how we do that with SVG icons.
38

38

00:01:52,179  -->  00:01:56,454
What we have to do is to use the fill property,
39

39

00:01:56,454  -->  00:02:00,799
and then we use the primary color, color-primary.
40

40

00:02:00,799  -->  00:02:03,626
That's our golden color here again.
41

41

00:02:03,626  -->  00:02:06,291
And then finally, let's just size it.
42

42

00:02:06,291  -->  00:02:09,708
You want a width of 45 pixels or 4.5 rem,
43

43

00:02:11,054  -->  00:02:12,283
and then the same for the height.
44

44

00:02:12,283  -->  00:02:14,283
That's usually the same.
45

45

00:02:16,814  -->  00:02:20,738
Now finally, we also want to style the heading-4.
46

46

00:02:20,738  -->  00:02:23,988
That's gonna be in the typography file.
47

47

00:02:28,990  -->  00:02:29,823
Heading-4.
48

48

00:02:30,906  -->  00:02:32,207
We will then also later have
49

49

00:02:32,207  -->  00:02:34,336
the heading one, two, three, and four.
50

50

00:02:34,336  -->  00:02:37,336
Let me actually do all of them here.
51

51

00:02:38,505  -->  00:02:39,338
Why not?
52

52

00:02:41,236  -->  00:02:42,582
One,
53

53

00:02:42,582  -->  00:02:43,800
two,
54

54

00:02:43,800  -->  00:02:45,229
three, and then four here.
55

55

00:02:45,229  -->  00:02:46,062
All right.
56

56

00:02:46,062  -->  00:02:48,044
We want them to have the font family
57

57

00:02:48,044  -->  00:02:52,044
that I mentioned before, which is this one here.
58

58

00:02:52,919  -->  00:02:53,752
Sorry.
59

59

00:02:53,752  -->  00:02:55,085
Now I closed it.
60

60

00:02:55,986  -->  00:02:58,200
We want the font-display.
61

61

00:02:58,200  -->  00:02:59,841
It's Josefin Sans.
62

62

00:02:59,841  -->  00:03:04,008
That's the one that we're gonna use for all of the headings.
63

63

00:03:06,950  -->  00:03:08,533
It is font-display.
64

64

00:03:09,738  -->  00:03:12,980
We also want the font-weight to be 400.
65

65

00:03:12,980  -->  00:03:15,250
Remember, we actually included that font-weight
66

66

00:03:15,250  -->  00:03:18,373
in the HTML from Google Fonts.
67

67

00:03:18,373  -->  00:03:20,439
Now we actually want all of these
68

68

00:03:20,439  -->  00:03:23,218
to have these two properties.
69

69

00:03:23,218  -->  00:03:26,801
That's a perfect use case for a CSS extend.
70

70

00:03:27,860  -->  00:03:29,795
We can do like this placeholder
71

71

00:03:29,795  -->  00:03:32,155
that I showed you a long time ago, I think.
72

72

00:03:32,155  -->  00:03:33,588
We haven't really used it since then.
73

73

00:03:33,588  -->  00:03:36,355
But now it's a good time to use it again.
74

74

00:03:36,355  -->  00:03:40,522
Use this placeholder, which I'm simply gonna call heading.
75

75

00:03:42,264  -->  00:03:44,014
Then I put this here.
76

76

00:03:46,087  -->  00:03:49,920
Now all I have to do is to extend all of these
77

77

00:03:51,648  -->  00:03:52,487
like this.
78

78

00:03:52,487  -->  00:03:54,570
I say extend and heading.
79

79

00:03:56,313  -->  00:03:57,195
That's it.
80

80

00:03:57,195  -->  00:03:58,580
What's gonna happen now
81

81

00:03:58,580  -->  00:04:02,234
is that basically this heading-1 here is copied
82

82

00:04:02,234  -->  00:04:05,036
aligned to this place here.
83

83

00:04:05,036  -->  00:04:08,555
Let's copy this all over the place here.
84

84

00:04:08,555  -->  00:04:09,944
What's gonna happen now,
85

85

00:04:09,944  -->  00:04:13,188
it's like as if this heading-1, heading-2, heading-3,
86

86

00:04:13,188  -->  00:04:17,355
and heading-4 will be copied here to this selector.
87

87

00:04:18,811  -->  00:04:22,425
It's not a mixin because a mixin works the other way around.
88

88

00:04:22,425  -->  00:04:25,913
The mixin, this code here will then be paste
89

89

00:04:25,913  -->  00:04:27,975
into each of the selectors.
90

90

00:04:27,975  -->  00:04:30,245
An extend works the other way around.
91

91

00:04:30,245  -->  00:04:34,671
Basically the selectors are copied into a huge selector,
92

92

00:04:34,671  -->  00:04:39,079
which then makes this code here apply to all of them.
93

93

00:04:39,079  -->  00:04:42,599
Anyway, we were talking about the heading-4.
94

94

00:04:42,599  -->  00:04:46,349
Here the font size, we want it to be 1.9 rem.
95

95

00:04:47,750  -->  00:04:49,055
Now remember that I told you
96

96

00:04:49,055  -->  00:04:51,016
that we want to use this heading-4
97

97

00:04:51,016  -->  00:04:53,962
in different situations throughout the page.
98

98

00:04:53,962  -->  00:04:57,369
We want to use it here on these features,
99

99

00:04:57,369  -->  00:04:59,811
but also this one is an H4 as well.
100

100

00:04:59,811  -->  00:05:01,133
You see that this one is white,
101

101

00:05:01,133  -->  00:05:03,044
and this one is dark.
102

102

00:05:03,044  -->  00:05:06,877
That's actually do that with a modifier class.
103

103

00:05:08,588  -->  00:05:10,838
Let's add a modifier class.
104

104

00:05:12,034  -->  00:05:13,201
One for light.
105

105

00:05:14,559  -->  00:05:18,798
And the color here is gonna be grey-light-1.
106

106

00:05:18,798  -->  00:05:22,965
And then we will have dark, and that's gonna be grey-dark-1.
107

107

00:05:25,233  -->  00:05:26,816
Actually it's here.
108

108

00:05:29,333  -->  00:05:30,166
All right.
109

109

00:05:31,793  -->  00:05:33,960
Let's just duplicate this.
110

110

00:05:37,506  -->  00:05:40,072
This one is for dark.
111

111

00:05:40,072  -->  00:05:44,239
Now we of course have to add this to the HTML as well.
112

112

00:05:48,659  -->  00:05:51,475
Let's add multiple cursors here in each of them,
113

113

00:05:51,475  -->  00:05:54,308
so we don't have to write it once.
114

114

00:05:55,468  -->  00:05:56,301
Heading-4.
115

115

00:05:57,619  -->  00:05:59,604
This one is a dark version.
116

116

00:05:59,604  -->  00:06:02,771
The modifier is with these two dashes.
117

117

00:06:04,824  -->  00:06:06,347
All right.
118

118

00:06:06,347  -->  00:06:09,625
Let's check it out in our page.
119

119

00:06:09,625  -->  00:06:12,057
That already looks quite good.
120

120

00:06:12,057  -->  00:06:15,135
This icon here has the correct size.
121

121

00:06:15,135  -->  00:06:19,337
All of this looks just like we have it here.
122

122

00:06:19,337  -->  00:06:22,679
Now all we have to do is to actually align these elements
123

123

00:06:22,679  -->  00:06:24,530
like we have it here.
124

124

00:06:24,530  -->  00:06:26,549
How are we gonna do that?
125

125

00:06:26,549  -->  00:06:29,597
Once again, we are going to use a CSS grid here.
126

126

00:06:29,597  -->  00:06:30,610
Because why not?
127

127

00:06:30,610  -->  00:06:31,822
This is just a small component,
128

128

00:06:31,822  -->  00:06:35,513
and we actually a two-dimensional layout here.
129

129

00:06:35,513  -->  00:06:36,998
Let's take a look.
130

130

00:06:36,998  -->  00:06:38,725
This is actually two dimensions.
131

131

00:06:38,725  -->  00:06:41,974
We have the row axis and the column axis.
132

132

00:06:41,974  -->  00:06:44,658
It's really a two-dimensional.
133

133

00:06:44,658  -->  00:06:47,722
Why not use a CSS grid for doing that?
134

134

00:06:47,722  -->  00:06:50,330
We will have a two-by-two grid.
135

135

00:06:50,330  -->  00:06:53,997
Let me show it to you here actually already.
136

136

00:06:55,172  -->  00:06:57,083
That's not the one.
137

137

00:06:57,083  -->  00:06:58,054
That's the one.
138

138

00:06:58,054  -->  00:07:01,034
We're gonna have this two-by-two grid.
139

139

00:07:01,034  -->  00:07:04,766
And then in there, we will place the three elements.
140

140

00:07:04,766  -->  00:07:06,516
Does that make sense?
141

141

00:07:08,487  -->  00:07:10,737
Typography is done for now.
142

142

00:07:11,891  -->  00:07:16,307
This feature here, which itself is a grid item of course,
143

143

00:07:16,307  -->  00:07:18,873
will now also become a grid container.
144

144

00:07:18,873  -->  00:07:21,653
So we have a grid inside a grid inside a grid.
145

145

00:07:21,653  -->  00:07:23,600
Just like we had in flexbox,
146

146

00:07:23,600  -->  00:07:27,767
we can really nest the grids really deep.
147

147

00:07:27,767  -->  00:07:28,934
Display, grid.
148

148

00:07:30,722  -->  00:07:33,722
Let's start by defining the columns,
149

149

00:07:35,639  -->  00:07:36,947
grid-template-columns.
150

150

00:07:36,947  -->  00:07:40,179
What width do we want to have for the first column?
151

151

00:07:40,179  -->  00:07:42,750
The first column will contain the icon.
152

152

00:07:42,750  -->  00:07:46,916
We already know the width of the icon, so it's 4.5 rem.
153

153

00:07:46,916  -->  00:07:50,859
In this column here, we could simply put 4.5 rem as well.
154

154

00:07:50,859  -->  00:07:54,741
But instead of doing that, we will simply put auto,
155

155

00:07:54,741  -->  00:07:57,193
or we could use min-content or max-content.
156

156

00:07:57,193  -->  00:07:58,573
Let's actually use min-content.
157

157

00:07:58,573  -->  00:07:59,888
Why not?
158

158

00:07:59,888  -->  00:08:00,721
Because this way,
159

159

00:08:00,721  -->  00:08:02,579
if we eventually wanted to change
160

160

00:08:02,579  -->  00:08:04,302
the width here of the icon,
161

161

00:08:04,302  -->  00:08:07,565
then automatically the width of this column would adjust
162

162

00:08:07,565  -->  00:08:09,627
without us having to change anything.
163

163

00:08:09,627  -->  00:08:11,735
And then the rest of the grid.
164

164

00:08:11,735  -->  00:08:15,978
The second column will simply occupy the rest.
165

165

00:08:15,978  -->  00:08:16,948
Okay.
166

166

00:08:16,948  -->  00:08:18,414
Simple as that.
167

167

00:08:18,414  -->  00:08:19,658
Makes sense?
168

168

00:08:19,658  -->  00:08:21,079
Now as for the rows,
169

169

00:08:21,079  -->  00:08:23,551
again we don't really need to specify them
170

170

00:08:23,551  -->  00:08:26,791
because all we want to happen is them to be the size
171

171

00:08:26,791  -->  00:08:28,482
of the content.
172

172

00:08:28,482  -->  00:08:30,579
Once more, we don't really define them.
173

173

00:08:30,579  -->  00:08:33,758
Probably you start to see this emerging as a trend.
174

174

00:08:33,758  -->  00:08:36,580
Many times, we don't really define the row,
175

175

00:08:36,580  -->  00:08:38,975
we just define the columns.
176

176

00:08:38,975  -->  00:08:39,983
In a real world scenario,
177

177

00:08:39,983  -->  00:08:41,869
that's actually many times the case.
178

178

00:08:41,869  -->  00:08:45,813
Many times, we just want the content to define the rows.
179

179

00:08:45,813  -->  00:08:48,982
In that case, it's not really necessary to define the rows.
180

180

00:08:48,982  -->  00:08:52,129
We will have other cases where we will define the rows.
181

181

00:08:52,129  -->  00:08:53,287
You're gonna see that later.
182

182

00:08:53,287  -->  00:08:55,220
But for now, it's good like this.
183

183

00:08:55,220  -->  00:08:57,548
It works perfectly fine like this.
184

184

00:08:57,548  -->  00:08:59,013
Let's check it out.
185

185

00:08:59,013  -->  00:09:00,279
We'll see that it's actually
186

186

00:09:00,279  -->  00:09:03,370
not really perfect yet, okay? (laughs)
187

187

00:09:03,370  -->  00:09:06,689
Let's check out what's happening here.
188

188

00:09:06,689  -->  00:09:08,585
Let's inspect this.
189

189

00:09:08,585  -->  00:09:11,856
Here you see all four grid cells.
190

190

00:09:11,856  -->  00:09:14,753
The first one is actually larger, much larger
191

191

00:09:14,753  -->  00:09:17,354
than the icon, and that's because right now,
192

192

00:09:17,354  -->  00:09:20,042
we only have three elements in this grid.
193

193

00:09:20,042  -->  00:09:21,340
So the third one of course,
194

194

00:09:21,340  -->  00:09:23,436
because of the auto-placement algorithm,
195

195

00:09:23,436  -->  00:09:26,169
gets placed here under this icon.
196

196

00:09:26,169  -->  00:09:27,054
What we could do here
197

197

00:09:27,054  -->  00:09:29,956
is to place this grid item here in this grid cell.
198

198

00:09:29,956  -->  00:09:31,512
But actually what's even better
199

199

00:09:31,512  -->  00:09:33,358
is to make this grid cell here
200

200

00:09:33,358  -->  00:09:35,631
span all the way here until the end,
201

201

00:09:35,631  -->  00:09:40,180
so that we end up with this grid area here for this icon
202

202

00:09:40,180  -->  00:09:41,104
because right now,
203

203

00:09:41,104  -->  00:09:44,806
this row here is also as high as this icon,
204

204

00:09:44,806  -->  00:09:47,123
but actually we do not want it to be as large,
205

205

00:09:47,123  -->  00:09:49,330
as high as this text here.
206

206

00:09:49,330  -->  00:09:51,586
If we had all of this column here,
207

207

00:09:51,586  -->  00:09:54,212
these two rows for this icon,
208

208

00:09:54,212  -->  00:09:56,865
then that would actually happen perfectly fine.
209

209

00:09:56,865  -->  00:09:59,245
Let me show that to you.
210

210

00:09:59,245  -->  00:10:03,521
The icon, we want it to have the grid-row property
211

211

00:10:03,521  -->  00:10:06,226
set to start at number one
212

212

00:10:06,226  -->  00:10:08,174
all the way to the end, or span two.
213

213

00:10:08,174  -->  00:10:09,775
In this case, it's really the same.
214

214

00:10:09,775  -->  00:10:12,142
We could just add minus one,
215

215

00:10:12,142  -->  00:10:15,008
and then we're sure that it goes all the way until the end.
216

216

00:10:15,008  -->  00:10:18,569
Automatically now, the text should get placed here
217

217

00:10:18,569  -->  00:10:19,926
to the end.
218

218

00:10:19,926  -->  00:10:22,673
For some reason, that didn't really happen.
219

219

00:10:22,673  -->  00:10:25,089
This is actually a good opportunity
220

220

00:10:25,089  -->  00:10:27,017
to tell you something important
221

221

00:10:27,017  -->  00:10:29,434
that I didn't tell you yet, I think.
222

222

00:10:29,434  -->  00:10:33,035
This minus one here, this means not the end of the grid
223

223

00:10:33,035  -->  00:10:36,773
but the end of the explicit grid, okay?
224

224

00:10:36,773  -->  00:10:40,060
This would be the last explicit grid line.
225

225

00:10:40,060  -->  00:10:42,932
But we didn't really define any grid rows,
226

226

00:10:42,932  -->  00:10:45,841
so there is not really an explicit grid.
227

227

00:10:45,841  -->  00:10:48,956
This minus one here doesn't make much sense.
228

228

00:10:48,956  -->  00:10:53,853
Instead of just minus one, we should simply add span two.
229

229

00:10:53,853  -->  00:10:54,833
Makes sense?
230

230

00:10:54,833  -->  00:10:58,405
Again, the minus one only works with an explicit grid,
231

231

00:10:58,405  -->  00:10:59,596
but we had an implicit grid
232

232

00:10:59,596  -->  00:11:01,849
because we didn't define the row,
233

233

00:11:01,849  -->  00:11:04,645
so it didn't work as expected.
234

234

00:11:04,645  -->  00:11:06,672
Right now it does.
235

235

00:11:06,672  -->  00:11:09,172
Let's inspect it here as well.
236

236

00:11:10,621  -->  00:11:13,171
It doesn't really highlight here the spanning going on,
237

237

00:11:13,171  -->  00:11:16,296
but it doesn't matter because we can see it by ourselves.
238

238

00:11:16,296  -->  00:11:18,596
Because you see that this icon here
239

239

00:11:18,596  -->  00:11:20,894
is actually already in this second cell.
240

240

00:11:20,894  -->  00:11:23,308
This is like all the same cell.
241

241

00:11:23,308  -->  00:11:27,475
Actually I think if you hover it here, then you will see it.
242

242

00:11:28,454  -->  00:11:32,099
Not really, but again, that's not a huge problem.
243

243

00:11:32,099  -->  00:11:33,488
We're almost done here now.
244

244

00:11:33,488  -->  00:11:35,831
What we need now is of course some spacing here.
245

245

00:11:35,831  -->  00:11:39,392
Let's add some spacing between the columns and the rows.
246

246

00:11:39,392  -->  00:11:42,299
That's very simple, of course.
247

247

00:11:42,299  -->  00:11:44,966
So I'll just add a grid-row-gap.
248

248

00:11:46,363  -->  00:11:48,196
Let's make it 1.5 rem.
249

249

00:11:49,933  -->  00:11:54,100
And then again for the column as well, grid-column-gap.
250

250

00:11:56,358  -->  00:11:59,317
This one is 2.5 rem, okay?
251

251

00:11:59,317  -->  00:12:01,492
Let's check it out again.
252

252

00:12:01,492  -->  00:12:02,558
All right.
253

253

00:12:02,558  -->  00:12:03,391
Here we go.
254

254

00:12:03,391  -->  00:12:05,806
That looks really good, really good already.
255

255

00:12:05,806  -->  00:12:08,059
Just a couple of things that we need to change here.
256

256

00:12:08,059  -->  00:12:10,892
First of all, in our demo project,
257

257

00:12:11,879  -->  00:12:15,031
these icons here are actually a bit moved to the top.
258

258

00:12:15,031  -->  00:12:18,561
Basically to center this, the center of the icon
259

259

00:12:18,561  -->  00:12:20,529
here with the text.
260

260

00:12:20,529  -->  00:12:24,783
That's just something that we have to do manually.
261

261

00:12:24,783  -->  00:12:26,033
Let's fix that.
262

262

00:12:27,541  -->  00:12:29,271
Very simply, you're just gonna translate
263

263

00:12:29,271  -->  00:12:31,438
the icon a bit to the top.
264

264

00:12:32,831  -->  00:12:36,414
Transform and translate in the Y direction,
265

265

00:12:37,712  -->  00:12:39,295
just minus one rem.
266

266

00:12:41,261  -->  00:12:43,011
That should fix that.
267

267

00:12:46,133  -->  00:12:46,966
Yeah.
268

268

00:12:46,966  -->  00:12:48,489
That looks a bit more natural now.
269

269

00:12:48,489  -->  00:12:51,761
Our second issue is that you see in these two columns
270

270

00:12:51,761  -->  00:12:53,967
where we only have three lines of text
271

271

00:12:53,967  -->  00:12:56,879
that the space here is huge.
272

272

00:12:56,879  -->  00:12:58,944
I mentioned before that I wanted to have different text
273

273

00:12:58,944  -->  00:13:01,213
in the different elements.
274

274

00:13:01,213  -->  00:13:03,271
That's because I wanted to show you
275

275

00:13:03,271  -->  00:13:06,204
how we can fix exactly this issue.
276

276

00:13:06,204  -->  00:13:08,830
Let's actually inspect it.
277

277

00:13:08,830  -->  00:13:11,305
We want this one here now.
278

278

00:13:11,305  -->  00:13:13,554
You can see that this row here
279

279

00:13:13,554  -->  00:13:17,137
is larger than the row in here and in here.
280

280

00:13:19,481  -->  00:13:20,565
Why is this happening?
281

281

00:13:20,565  -->  00:13:23,733
It's happening because this features grid here,
282

282

00:13:23,733  -->  00:13:26,555
which contains these six grid items,
283

283

00:13:26,555  -->  00:13:28,442
makes it so that these grid items
284

284

00:13:28,442  -->  00:13:32,095
that all of the grid items fill the entire cells.
285

285

00:13:32,095  -->  00:13:34,742
That's because of the align-item's property
286

286

00:13:34,742  -->  00:13:37,405
that is by default set to stretch.
287

287

00:13:37,405  -->  00:13:38,406
Remember that?
288

288

00:13:38,406  -->  00:13:41,894
Align-items is a property that controls the alignment
289

289

00:13:41,894  -->  00:13:44,719
of grid items along grid cells.
290

290

00:13:44,719  -->  00:13:48,648
These here are the grid items of this features grid.
291

291

00:13:48,648  -->  00:13:52,775
Currently, this align-items property is set to stretch.
292

292

00:13:52,775  -->  00:13:55,148
What do we do if we want all of them here
293

293

00:13:55,148  -->  00:13:57,070
to start at the top?
294

294

00:13:57,070  -->  00:14:00,118
Basically move all of this here to the top.
295

295

00:14:00,118  -->  00:14:02,430
We just have to set the align-items property
296

296

00:14:02,430  -->  00:14:05,680
on this parent container here to start.
297

297

00:14:06,781  -->  00:14:08,590
Let's do that.
298

298

00:14:08,590  -->  00:14:11,257
This here is the grid container.
299

299

00:14:12,109  -->  00:14:15,026
Align-items, let's set it to start.
300

300

00:14:18,090  -->  00:14:21,495
If we're back now, that is how it looks like.
301

301

00:14:21,495  -->  00:14:25,634
We could maybe even give this here like a background color,
302

302

00:14:25,634  -->  00:14:27,596
but actually that's not even necessary
303

303

00:14:27,596  -->  00:14:29,519
because even with this inspector here,
304

304

00:14:29,519  -->  00:14:31,082
we can see that this grid item
305

305

00:14:31,082  -->  00:14:34,436
is now no longer the exact same of the grid cell
306

306

00:14:34,436  -->  00:14:36,397
but just the size of its content
307

307

00:14:36,397  -->  00:14:38,159
moved all the way to the top
308

308

00:14:38,159  -->  00:14:40,888
just as we specify at the grid container.
309

309

00:14:40,888  -->  00:14:44,901
Of course, we could also set this to end.
310

310

00:14:44,901  -->  00:14:48,105
Let me show you how that would look like.
311

311

00:14:48,105  -->  00:14:48,938
Yeah.
312

312

00:14:48,938  -->  00:14:50,191
Then it would move these two here,
313

313

00:14:50,191  -->  00:14:52,927
which are smaller than the other items.
314

314

00:14:52,927  -->  00:14:54,606
It would move them simply to the end,
315

315

00:14:54,606  -->  00:14:58,329
so to the bottom of their grid cell.
316

316

00:14:58,329  -->  00:15:00,662
Or we could try center also.
317

317

00:15:02,507  -->  00:15:03,465
All right.
318

318

00:15:03,465  -->  00:15:06,088
Now it's centered but that's still not what we want.
319

319

00:15:06,088  -->  00:15:09,171
We just want them to be at the start.
320

320

00:15:10,404  -->  00:15:12,398
It's really important that you are aware
321

321

00:15:12,398  -->  00:15:14,604
that all of these properties that I showed you
322

322

00:15:14,604  -->  00:15:16,926
in the first section, so an intersection,
323

323

00:15:16,926  -->  00:15:18,787
that all of these properties exist,
324

324

00:15:18,787  -->  00:15:22,282
and what they do and how you can use them to your advantage
325

325

00:15:22,282  -->  00:15:25,712
to achieve exactly what you need to achieve.
326

326

00:15:25,712  -->  00:15:28,490
In this case, we really needed the align-items
327

327

00:15:28,490  -->  00:15:31,269
to move all of this up to the top,
328

328

00:15:31,269  -->  00:15:33,453
so up the column axis.
329

329

00:15:33,453  -->  00:15:34,439
All right.
330

330

00:15:34,439  -->  00:15:38,472
Right now, it actually looks the exact same as our demo.
331

331

00:15:38,472  -->  00:15:40,655
There is just one small thing to fix
332

332

00:15:40,655  -->  00:15:43,488
because when you reduce this here,
333

333

00:15:45,396  -->  00:15:47,568
what you see is then it gets narrow and narrow
334

334

00:15:47,568  -->  00:15:48,889
and even more narrow.
335

335

00:15:48,889  -->  00:15:50,906
What we want to do here of course
336

336

00:15:50,906  -->  00:15:52,974
is what I showed you in the last section,
337

337

00:15:52,974  -->  00:15:55,078
which is basically to make this responsive
338

338

00:15:55,078  -->  00:15:58,167
without writing a single line of media query.
339

339

00:15:58,167  -->  00:16:00,250
That's what happens here.
340

340

00:16:01,217  -->  00:16:04,928
As you see, at some point, the text gets smaller,
341

341

00:16:04,928  -->  00:16:05,932
and that's because of media query,
342

342

00:16:05,932  -->  00:16:08,328
but that's not what I'm talking about.
343

343

00:16:08,328  -->  00:16:10,846
What happens is that at some point,
344

344

00:16:10,846  -->  00:16:13,940
you see that it moves down here.
345

345

00:16:13,940  -->  00:16:18,795
Instead of a three-by-two grid, we now have a two-by-three.
346

346

00:16:18,795  -->  00:16:21,492
And then as it gets even smaller,
347

347

00:16:21,492  -->  00:16:24,492
it does basically a one-by-six grid.
348

348

00:16:25,774  -->  00:16:27,680
That's what we want to achieve.
349

349

00:16:27,680  -->  00:16:29,895
That's quite simple actually
350

350

00:16:29,895  -->  00:16:31,908
even without media queries.
351

351

00:16:31,908  -->  00:16:34,089
Do you remember how we did that?
352

352

00:16:34,089  -->  00:16:37,886
All we have to change here is these grid-template-columns,
353

353

00:16:37,886  -->  00:16:40,486
and define some new column tracks,
354

354

00:16:40,486  -->  00:16:42,569
so grid-template-columns.
355

355

00:16:45,477  -->  00:16:48,848
Do you remember what the trick here is?
356

356

00:16:48,848  -->  00:16:53,015
First of all, we need to use the auto-fit keyword in here.
357

357

00:16:54,233  -->  00:16:56,214
Remember what auto-fit does?
358

358

00:16:56,214  -->  00:16:59,224
It simply create as many tracks as can fit
359

359

00:16:59,224  -->  00:17:02,453
based on the width that we define.
360

360

00:17:02,453  -->  00:17:04,477
This width that we define here
361

361

00:17:04,477  -->  00:17:07,404
will be with the minmax function.
362

362

00:17:07,404  -->  00:17:10,699
Minmax, and we say that the width should always stay
363

363

00:17:10,699  -->  00:17:13,949
between 25 rem and one fractional unit.
364

364

00:17:16,151  -->  00:17:18,048
That's as simple as it.
365

365

00:17:18,048  -->  00:17:19,919
Actually I said 25. (laughs)
366

366

00:17:19,919  -->  00:17:20,871
Okay.
367

367

00:17:20,871  -->  00:17:23,136
250 pixels, basically.
368

368

00:17:23,136  -->  00:17:25,936
Again, the width of each of the tracks
369

369

00:17:25,936  -->  00:17:30,103
should always stay between 250 rem and one fractional unit.
370

370

00:17:31,452  -->  00:17:35,784
Based on this, CSS will add as many tracks as fit
371

371

00:17:35,784  -->  00:17:37,602
in the container.
372

372

00:17:37,602  -->  00:17:40,763
That's exactly what we did in one of the demo examples
373

373

00:17:40,763  -->  00:17:42,412
in the last section.
374

374

00:17:42,412  -->  00:17:44,995
Let's check it out if it works.
375

375

00:17:46,245  -->  00:17:47,796
Where is the container?
376

376

00:17:47,796  -->  00:17:48,629
Okay.
377

377

00:17:48,629  -->  00:17:50,974
We start with the 1,120 pixels.
378

378

00:17:50,974  -->  00:17:52,580
Let's move it down now.
379

379

00:17:52,580  -->  00:17:56,747
Remember that each column can have up to 250 pixels.
380

380

00:17:58,708  -->  00:18:00,642
We start decreasing, decreasing,
381

381

00:18:00,642  -->  00:18:02,246
and then bam, you see?
382

382

00:18:02,246  -->  00:18:05,543
At this point, it no longer could fit three columns,
383

383

00:18:05,543  -->  00:18:08,854
so it reduced it to two columns.
384

384

00:18:08,854  -->  00:18:10,854
Let's check it out here.
385

385

00:18:11,963  -->  00:18:14,896
You see this feature here is 251,
386

386

00:18:14,896  -->  00:18:19,569
which is almost the minimum size that it has to have.
387

387

00:18:19,569  -->  00:18:20,586
You see it now?
388

388

00:18:20,586  -->  00:18:21,419
Bam.
389

389

00:18:22,790  -->  00:18:23,982
250.
390

390

00:18:23,982  -->  00:18:26,398
And a bit last, we'll push it off the edge,
391

391

00:18:26,398  -->  00:18:29,648
and bring it down to two-column tracks.
392

392

00:18:30,820  -->  00:18:31,954
That's really amazing.
393

393

00:18:31,954  -->  00:18:34,212
That's really great and powerful.
394

394

00:18:34,212  -->  00:18:35,821
Now you see that it's even more important
395

395

00:18:35,821  -->  00:18:40,727
to use this align-items set to start that I had before.
396

396

00:18:40,727  -->  00:18:42,294
For example now here,
397

397

00:18:42,294  -->  00:18:44,640
you have a lot of empty space down here.
398

398

00:18:44,640  -->  00:18:46,208
It's really important
399

399

00:18:46,208  -->  00:18:49,993
that you see that if we inspect this here,
400

400

00:18:49,993  -->  00:18:53,031
so the size of the item is just this.
401

401

00:18:53,031  -->  00:18:55,253
Without the align-items set to start,
402

402

00:18:55,253  -->  00:18:57,503
it would look really weird.
403

403

00:18:58,764  -->  00:19:01,744
This works just the way I explained before,
404

404

00:19:01,744  -->  00:19:03,517
and everything is working.
405

405

00:19:03,517  -->  00:19:06,489
Of course we could change this 250 pixels to something else,
406

406

00:19:06,489  -->  00:19:09,331
but I found that it works really well
407

407

00:19:09,331  -->  00:19:11,748
in this particular situation.
408

408

00:19:12,662  -->  00:19:13,569
Okay.
409

409

00:19:13,569  -->  00:19:16,046
We're actually done with this section.
410

410

00:19:16,046  -->  00:19:18,068
We used two grids here.
411

411

00:19:18,068  -->  00:19:22,302
One big grid, which could fit all of these six items here,
412

412

00:19:22,302  -->  00:19:25,360
so one grid item for each feature.
413

413

00:19:25,360  -->  00:19:28,375
And then each feature is a grid container itself,
414

414

00:19:28,375  -->  00:19:32,495
which then itself contains these three grid items,
415

415

00:19:32,495  -->  00:19:36,287
so the icon, this H4, and this text.
416

416

00:19:36,287  -->  00:19:39,872
Grid allows us to nest as many grids inside of each other,
417

417

00:19:39,872  -->  00:19:41,307
and that is very helpful to create
418

418

00:19:41,307  -->  00:19:44,602
even very small two-dimensional layouts like this one.
419

419

00:19:44,602  -->  00:19:48,018
We could have used like flexbox for this one here as well
420

420

00:19:48,018  -->  00:19:50,814
but then we would have to mess with margins.
421

421

00:19:50,814  -->  00:19:54,027
We would have added a margin to the bottom of this here,
422

422

00:19:54,027  -->  00:19:55,825
for example, or the top of the text,
423

423

00:19:55,825  -->  00:19:58,415
and that would have added some extra complexity
424

424

00:19:58,415  -->  00:20:02,368
that is not really necessary if we can use CSS grid.
425

425

00:20:02,368  -->  00:20:05,602
Grids don't only work for the big layout parts
426

426

00:20:05,602  -->  00:20:06,716
like some people say,
427

427

00:20:06,716  -->  00:20:09,400
but they can also be for very small components
428

428

00:20:09,400  -->  00:20:11,220
as long as they are two-dimensional,
429

429

00:20:11,220  -->  00:20:14,555
then it makes a lot of sense using grids for that.
430

430

00:20:14,555  -->  00:20:18,305
Next up, we're going to build this part here.
431

431

00:20:20,303  -->  00:20:22,470
Yeah, stay tuned for that.
