00:00:01.041  -->  00:00:02.689
<v Narrator>With our coat now nicely organized</v>
2

2

00:00:02.689  -->  00:00:04.538
with some variables in nesting,
3

3

00:00:04.538  -->  00:00:08.208
we are now ready to implement the CSS architecture
4

4

00:00:08.208  -->  00:00:11.503
that we've been talking about earlier.
5

5

00:00:11.503  -->  00:00:15.745
What I mean is a 7-1 pattern where we create seven
6

6

00:00:15.745  -->  00:00:18.809
folders and one main SASS file to import all
7

7

00:00:18.809  -->  00:00:21.995
the files that are in these folders.
8

8

00:00:21.995  -->  00:00:24.301
So, Let's start by creating the base folder
9

9

00:00:24.301  -->  00:00:25.973
which is where we're going to put
10

10

00:00:25.973  -->  00:00:27.958
our basic project definitions.
11

11

00:00:27.958  -->  00:00:29.606
Like a project boiler plate.
12

12

00:00:29.606  -->  00:00:30.773
So new folder.
13

13

00:00:32.992  -->  00:00:34.637
Base.
14

14

00:00:34.637  -->  00:00:37.220
So all of these folders are going to be
15

15

00:00:37.220  -->  00:00:40.772
inside the SASS folder of course.
16

16

00:00:40.772  -->  00:00:42.332
Now, inside this base folder,
17

17

00:00:42.332  -->  00:00:45.834
we should have a file which is also called base.
18

18

00:00:45.834  -->  00:00:48.102
So a base SASS file.
19

19

00:00:48.102  -->  00:00:50.841
This file will be for the real low level basics,
20

20

00:00:50.841  -->  00:00:53.718
such as resets and styles for the HML
21

21

00:00:53.718  -->  00:00:56.446
and body element selectors.
22

22

00:00:56.446  -->  00:00:58.542
Note this file should be a partial
23

23

00:00:58.542  -->  00:01:02.941
so we can later import it into the main SASS file.
24

24

00:01:02.941  -->  00:01:05.690
Remember the first lecture ever that we had about SASS?
25

25

00:01:05.690  -->  00:01:09.549
Back then I talked about partials and imports,
26

26

00:01:09.549  -->  00:01:11.600
so that's what I'm meaning here.
27

27

00:01:11.600  -->  00:01:14.003
The partial files they always start with an
28

28

00:01:14.003  -->  00:01:15.511
underscore.
29

29

00:01:15.511  -->  00:01:16.968
Like this.
30

30

00:01:16.968  -->  00:01:18.974
If I want to call this file base,
31

31

00:01:18.974  -->  00:01:22.307
then I just have to write is _base.scss,
32

32

00:01:23.150  -->  00:01:24.383
and that's it.
33

33

00:01:24.383  -->  00:01:27.383
Now this is a partial SASS file. OK?
34

34

00:01:28.749  -->  00:01:31.387
So, that's actually imported into our main file.
35

35

00:01:31.387  -->  00:01:33.850
I will put it here at the top.
36

36

00:01:33.850  -->  00:01:37.933
And all we have to do now is simply write @import
37

37

00:01:40.527  -->  00:01:43.371
and then the path to the file.
38

38

00:01:43.371  -->  00:01:45.792
So, it is in the base folder. Right?
39

39

00:01:45.792  -->  00:01:49.213
Because remember we are in the main file zoom
40

40

00:01:49.213  -->  00:01:50.980
so we are here in the folder system,
41

41

00:01:50.980  -->  00:01:54.067
so from here we just have to move into the base folder,
42

42

00:01:54.067  -->  00:01:56.991
and then from there we select the base file.
43

43

00:01:56.991  -->  00:01:58.666
Now we don't have to use the underscore.
44

44

00:01:58.666  -->  00:02:00.368
All we have to do is...base
45

45

00:02:00.368  -->  00:02:02.868
So no underscore and no .scss.
46

46

00:02:04.255  -->  00:02:05.759
This is enough for SASS to understand
47

47

00:02:05.759  -->  00:02:08.426
what we want to import here. OK?
48

48

00:02:09.617  -->  00:02:10.936
And that's it.
49

49

00:02:10.936  -->  00:02:13.040
Now some other files that you usually want in the base
50

50

00:02:13.040  -->  00:02:15.707
folder are files for animations.
51

51

00:02:19.401  -->  00:02:20.984
So animations.scss.
52

52

00:02:21.935  -->  00:02:25.852
Then we usually also have a file for typography
53

53

00:02:27.445  -->  00:02:29.028
so typography.scss.
54

54

00:02:31.299  -->  00:02:33.863
So we're going to fill all these files
55

55

00:02:33.863  -->  00:02:36.914
over the next lectures. OK?
56

56

00:02:36.914  -->  00:02:39.669
And another one for utilities as well.
57

57

00:02:39.669  -->  00:02:42.172
And, again you'll see it in one of the next lectures.
58

58

00:02:42.172  -->  00:02:43.755
So, utilities.scss.
59

59

00:02:47.442  -->  00:02:51.035
That's enough for the base folder.
60

60

00:02:51.035  -->  00:02:55.917
They keep opening up here but we can just close them.
61

61

00:02:55.917  -->  00:02:57.919
This one as well. Alright.
62

62

00:02:57.919  -->  00:02:59.453
Now once you see the whole picture,
63

63

00:02:59.453  -->  00:03:01.786
with all of the folders and all of the files,
64

64

00:03:01.786  -->  00:03:04.457
then everything will fall into place and
65

65

00:03:04.457  -->  00:03:06.269
make more sense to you.
66

66

00:03:06.269  -->  00:03:08.401
Now, I want you to keep in mind that
67

67

00:03:08.401  -->  00:03:10.064
this architecture is really
68

68

00:03:10.064  -->  00:03:14.333
designed to handle large multi-page websites or web apps.
69

69

00:03:14.333  -->  00:03:15.983
So maybe for a small landing page
70

70

00:03:15.983  -->  00:03:18.604
like the project we're working on here,
71

71

00:03:18.604  -->  00:03:22.981
this might seem like a bit too much, a bit overkill.
72

72

00:03:22.981  -->  00:03:26.855
But once you start working on a huge project then you'll
73

73

00:03:26.855  -->  00:03:29.252
appreciate how this makes things easier,
74

74

00:03:29.252  -->  00:03:32.601
so it's really important to have an architecture like this
75

75

00:03:32.601  -->  00:03:36.592
in place especially when we're working on a larger project.
76

76

00:03:36.592  -->  00:03:39.866
Okay, but let's move on and create another folder here.
77

77

00:03:39.866  -->  00:03:42.199
This one is called abstract.
78

78

00:03:43.871  -->  00:03:45.128
In this folder we're only going to put code
79

79

00:03:45.128  -->  00:03:48.708
that's not going to output any css.
80

80

00:03:48.708  -->  00:03:51.420
We already saw what type of code is that:
81

81

00:03:51.420  -->  00:03:54.746
variables, mixins, and stuff like that.
82

82

00:03:54.746  -->  00:03:57.646
Let's actually put these files in here.
83

83

00:03:57.646  -->  00:03:59.174
Now to make my life a bit easier,
84

84

00:03:59.174  -->  00:04:03.431
I'd will actually do it using the command line.
85

85

00:04:03.431  -->  00:04:06.170
But you of course if you don't like the terminal already,
86

86

00:04:06.170  -->  00:04:10.325
you can do it by hand in your code editor.
87

87

00:04:10.325  -->  00:04:12.408
I will just move to SASS,
88

88

00:04:13.691  -->  00:04:15.191
and then abstract,
89

89

00:04:16.703  -->  00:04:19.861
and then I will use touch to add files here.
90

90

00:04:19.861  -->  00:04:23.863
On Windows, you can use the edit command.
91

91

00:04:23.863  -->  00:04:25.795
As I was saying, the files that we want here
92

92

00:04:25.795  -->  00:04:27.295
are for variables,
93

93

00:04:29.298  -->  00:04:30.215
for mixins,
94

94

00:04:32.673  -->  00:04:34.489
and for functions.
95

95

00:04:34.489  -->  00:04:38.362
You can see that I can write all of these files
96

96

00:04:38.362  -->  00:04:42.015
that I want to create in one line in the touch command.
97

97

00:04:42.015  -->  00:04:45.932
Here are these three files that I just created.
98

98

00:04:48.493  -->  00:04:51.144
Alright, next up, let's create a components folder.
99

99

00:04:51.144  -->  00:04:53.094
In that folder we're then going to create
100

100

00:04:53.094  -->  00:04:56.423
one file for each of our components.
101

101

00:04:56.423  -->  00:04:59.525
Remember, that components are our reusable building blocks
102

102

00:04:59.525  -->  00:05:02.650
that make up our website or apps.
103

103

00:05:02.650  -->  00:05:05.113
They should also be usable anywhere on the page
104

104

00:05:05.113  -->  00:05:07.193
so that they are completely independent
105

105

00:05:07.193  -->  00:05:10.459
and held together by the layout of the page.
106

106

00:05:10.459  -->  00:05:12.876
So, let's create that folder.
107

107

00:05:16.923  -->  00:05:17.840
Components.
108

108

00:05:19.536  -->  00:05:21.746
For now we're going to leave it empty
109

109

00:05:21.746  -->  00:05:23.795
because we don't really have a component yet.
110

110

00:05:23.795  -->  00:05:27.260
Actually, we do have, but let's worry about that later.
111

111

00:05:27.260  -->  00:05:30.131
This is the components folder and remember that
112

112

00:05:30.131  -->  00:05:33.683
the components are held together by the layout of the page.
113

113

00:05:33.683  -->  00:05:35.120
Since I was talking about layouts,
114

114

00:05:35.120  -->  00:05:37.322
we also need a layout folder for
115

115

00:05:37.322  -->  00:05:41.099
each piece of the global layout of the entire project.
116

116

00:05:41.099  -->  00:05:43.391
In the layout folder, we're going to have a
117

117

00:05:43.391  -->  00:05:47.056
global footer, header, et cetera...so stuff like that.
118

118

00:05:47.056  -->  00:05:48.389
So mkdir layout.
119

119

00:05:51.739  -->  00:05:53.768
Remember this architecture is designed
120

120

00:05:53.768  -->  00:05:56.469
for multi-page projects so these layout elements
121

121

00:05:56.469  -->  00:05:59.802
should work everywhere and on all pages.
122

122

00:06:01.008  -->  00:06:03.248
Again, our components are our building blocks
123

123

00:06:03.248  -->  00:06:06.312
which are independent and reusable everywhere
124

124

00:06:06.312  -->  00:06:09.717
across our website and the layout is
125

125

00:06:09.717  -->  00:06:12.075
what holds all of these components together.
126

126

00:06:12.075  -->  00:06:14.269
But, again we are going to see how that works
127

127

00:06:14.269  -->  00:06:17.338
when we really dive deep into the project.
128

128

00:06:17.338  -->  00:06:18.945
Now, if you have very specific styles
129

129

00:06:18.945  -->  00:06:21.716
for a specific page, like for example, a homepage;
130

130

00:06:21.716  -->  00:06:24.771
we can then create a new file for that specific page
131

131

00:06:24.771  -->  00:06:27.834
and we do that in the pages folder.
132

132

00:06:27.834  -->  00:06:29.167
So, mkdir pages.
133

133

00:06:30.714  -->  00:06:32.573
That's actually what going to happen in our case
134

134

00:06:32.573  -->  00:06:35.246
because we can treat the landing page that we're building
135

135

00:06:35.246  -->  00:06:38.186
as like the home page, and there will certainly be
136

136

00:06:38.186  -->  00:06:41.488
styles that are only going apply to that page.
137

137

00:06:41.488  -->  00:06:44.809
Then later on, if our fictional company will expand
138

138

00:06:44.809  -->  00:06:47.051
and add more pages, then they can have
139

139

00:06:47.051  -->  00:06:51.012
different styles for the other different pages.
140

140

00:06:51.012  -->  00:06:53.870
So, let's actually create that one.
141

141

00:06:53.870  -->  00:06:55.870
So, pages and then touch
142

142

00:06:57.618  -->  00:06:58.751
home
143

143

00:06:58.751  -->  00:06:59.584
dot scss,
144

144

00:07:00.459  -->  00:07:01.700
then go back.
145

145

00:07:01.700  -->  00:07:04.071
So, these are the most important folders
146

146

00:07:04.071  -->  00:07:06.122
that we're going to use the most.
147

147

00:07:06.122  -->  00:07:08.508
But, you see that we only have five folders so far,
148

148

00:07:08.508  -->  00:07:10.545
so there are still two missing.
149

149

00:07:10.545  -->  00:07:12.934
So, the 7-1 architecture also has a folder
150

150

00:07:12.934  -->  00:07:15.204
for themes in case that you're doing like
151

151

00:07:15.204  -->  00:07:17.932
web apps with different themes, and there is also
152

152

00:07:17.932  -->  00:07:21.507
a vendors folder where we can put third party css.
153

153

00:07:21.507  -->  00:07:24.698
For example, the scss file off the boot strap,
154

154

00:07:24.698  -->  00:07:28.869
or an icon system, or an animation framework. Alright?
155

155

00:07:28.869  -->  00:07:32.545
For now, we're going to leave these empty in this project.
156

156

00:07:32.545  -->  00:07:34.862
Now, what we have to do is to, of course,
157

157

00:07:34.862  -->  00:07:39.029
import all of these files here into the main file.
158

158

00:07:40.835  -->  00:07:41.958
So, for now we don't have much here,
159

159

00:07:41.958  -->  00:07:44.791
but let's now import what we have.
160

160

00:07:46.156  -->  00:07:50.192
Actually, I'm just going to copy this one.
161

161

00:07:50.192  -->  00:07:53.192
So, for the base we have animations,
162

162

00:07:54.229  -->  00:07:56.396
actually that's once more,
163

163

00:07:57.453  -->  00:07:59.447
so animations
164

164

00:07:59.447  -->  00:08:00.280
base,
165

165

00:08:00.280  -->  00:08:01.113
typography
166

166

00:08:04.233  -->  00:08:05.400
and utilities.
167

167

00:08:09.771  -->  00:08:10.812
Alright?
168

168

00:08:10.812  -->  00:08:14.348
Now, in the abstract, which actually comes before,
169

169

00:08:14.348  -->  00:08:16.681
so let's put it before here.
170

170

00:08:18.285  -->  00:08:19.118
So import,
171

171

00:08:21.478  -->  00:08:23.895
abstracts and then functions,
172

172

00:08:27.690  -->  00:08:30.690
and let me just copy this entire....
173

173

00:08:32.011  -->  00:08:34.178
mixins and then variables.
174

174

00:08:37.948  -->  00:08:39.266
Alright.
175

175

00:08:39.266  -->  00:08:42.603
So, abstracts, base, components is still empty
176

176

00:08:42.603  -->  00:08:46.276
so nothing there, layout as well and now pages.
177

177

00:08:46.276  -->  00:08:47.193
So, import,
178

178

00:08:49.757  -->  00:08:50.590
pages
179

179

00:08:51.626  -->  00:08:53.044
and home.
180

180

00:08:53.044  -->  00:08:55.117
So, what I suggest we do next is to actually sort
181

181

00:08:55.117  -->  00:08:58.916
all of this code into different files,
182

182

00:08:58.916  -->  00:09:01.357
because the goal is that in the end this main
183

183

00:09:01.357  -->  00:09:04.361
file only serves to import all the other files.
184

184

00:09:04.361  -->  00:09:05.801
So, there will be no code here in this file
185

185

00:09:05.801  -->  00:09:09.869
except for all these import declarations. OK?
186

186

00:09:09.869  -->  00:09:13.066
So, let's put all of this code where it belongs.
187

187

00:09:13.066  -->  00:09:15.413
So, these are variables, and we know that there
188

188

00:09:15.413  -->  00:09:17.413
is a file just for that.
189

189

00:09:18.767  -->  00:09:22.934
So, that's it. Let's see if our SASS already compiled here.
190

190

00:09:24.487  -->  00:09:27.427
Well, it seems like something is going wrong here.
191

191

00:09:27.427  -->  00:09:31.594
Let's just close this one and let's try it again. OK?
192

192

00:09:34.437  -->  00:09:37.676
Actually, we can do it here. Clear.
193

193

00:09:37.676  -->  00:09:40.063
And, remember how it works? We just have to write
194

194

00:09:40.063  -->  00:09:42.730
mpm run and then the name of our
195

195

00:09:44.336  -->  00:09:46.296
script that we wrote here.
196

196

00:09:46.296  -->  00:09:48.879
So, it called compile and sass.
197

197

00:09:51.624  -->  00:09:53.041
So, compile:sass.
198

198

00:09:54.177  -->  00:09:57.235
Now it's waiting for, that we make some change here
199

199

00:09:57.235  -->  00:10:01.893
because this W flag here, it only works on changes.
200

200

00:10:01.893  -->  00:10:03.830
So, let's just change something here.
201

201

00:10:03.830  -->  00:10:07.997
I don't know, we can just delete this from here, actually.
202

202

00:10:09.050  -->  00:10:12.503
Let's just save it and see what it does.
203

203

00:10:12.503  -->  00:10:15.753
So, here we go. Now it's working again.
204

204

00:10:16.958  -->  00:10:19.400
This should be reloaded automatically and
205

205

00:10:19.400  -->  00:10:21.788
so you see that it still works which means
206

206

00:10:21.788  -->  00:10:24.606
that our import here was successful.
207

207

00:10:24.606  -->  00:10:28.106
We can actually check it out here as well.
208

208

00:10:30.016  -->  00:10:32.858
Yeah, so everything is still working just fine.
209

209

00:10:32.858  -->  00:10:35.253
So, this is our variables file and we are going to
210

210

00:10:35.253  -->  00:10:38.427
add a lot of variables in here over the next lectures,
211

211

00:10:38.427  -->  00:10:40.716
but for now let's just close it. OK?
212

212

00:10:40.716  -->  00:10:44.883
So, these things here they are going into the base file. OK?
213

213

00:10:46.198  -->  00:10:48.799
So, base, because here are the basic definitions
214

214

00:10:48.799  -->  00:10:50.882
about our entire project.
215

215

00:10:51.825  -->  00:10:53.949
Next, we have this animations file here
216

216

00:10:53.949  -->  00:10:56.357
and we have some animations here, right?
217

217

00:10:56.357  -->  00:10:58.690
So, let's put them in there.
218

218

00:11:00.038  -->  00:11:03.038
So, key frames and all of this code.
219

219

00:11:04.398  -->  00:11:07.065
So, now it all nicely separated.
220

220

00:11:08.217  -->  00:11:10.741
Whenever we want to see animation, check out
221

221

00:11:10.741  -->  00:11:12.756
how they work or change something, we already know
222

222

00:11:12.756  -->  00:11:16.597
all we have to do is go into this animations file.
223

223

00:11:16.597  -->  00:11:18.195
So, great.
224

224

00:11:18.195  -->  00:11:20.456
Now, the button, and actually we can say that
225

225

00:11:20.456  -->  00:11:23.048
the button is a component, because it's certainly a block.
226

226

00:11:23.048  -->  00:11:25.506
So, we can call it the component.
227

227

00:11:25.506  -->  00:11:27.956
It's reusable across the page, it's independent,
228

228

00:11:27.956  -->  00:11:30.389
it works everywhere and it's a building block
229

229

00:11:30.389  -->  00:11:33.047
that we can use wherever we want on our page.
230

230

00:11:33.047  -->  00:11:36.802
So, let's actually create a new file here
231

231

00:11:36.802  -->  00:11:38.453
in the components. OK?
232

232

00:11:38.453  -->  00:11:40.687
This time I'm going to do it here in editor.
233

233

00:11:40.687  -->  00:11:42.354
So, button dot scss.
234

234

00:11:45.370  -->  00:11:48.919
I'm going to put the code in there.
235

235

00:11:48.919  -->  00:11:52.336
So, the entire button code goes here. OK?
236

236

00:11:55.233  -->  00:11:57.358
Now, of course, never forget that we
237

237

00:11:57.358  -->  00:11:59.441
have to import it, right?
238

238

00:12:00.770  -->  00:12:04.020
So, base and then components. So, here.
239

239

00:12:05.643  -->  00:12:06.476
Import.
240

240

00:12:11.769  -->  00:12:14.269
So, now we imported this file.
241

241

00:12:16.180  -->  00:12:18.654
We can close it. So, what else do we have here?
242

242

00:12:18.654  -->  00:12:20.470
We have the header.
243

243

00:12:20.470  -->  00:12:21.947
Now the header, I'm not going to treat
244

244

00:12:21.947  -->  00:12:24.352
as a component. I'm actually going to treat it
245

245

00:12:24.352  -->  00:12:26.847
as a layout element.
246

246

00:12:26.847  -->  00:12:28.783
So we know that, probably on each page,
247

247

00:12:28.783  -->  00:12:31.561
that we'll have on in this website,
248

248

00:12:31.561  -->  00:12:33.696
but once again imagine that the website
249

249

00:12:33.696  -->  00:12:35.700
is going to expand, and then on each page
250

250

00:12:35.700  -->  00:12:38.558
we're going to have this header, right?
251

251

00:12:38.558  -->  00:12:39.772
So, this is the layout.
252

252

00:12:39.772  -->  00:12:44.642
So, let's add a file here in the layout for the header.
253

253

00:12:44.642  -->  00:12:46.309
Header dot scss. OK.
254

254

00:12:48.164  -->  00:12:51.832
Now, this is a bit subjective, of course.
255

255

00:12:51.832  -->  00:12:53.858
I mean, there's no right and wrong
256

256

00:12:53.858  -->  00:12:55.588
in how you divide your code.
257

257

00:12:55.588  -->  00:12:57.029
So, if you will say that this is a component,
258

258

00:12:57.029  -->  00:13:01.674
then maybe you're not wrong and you can, of course,
259

259

00:13:01.674  -->  00:13:05.052
then go ahead and create a component for this code.
260

260

00:13:05.052  -->  00:13:07.802
I think this is better organized
261

261

00:13:07.802  -->  00:13:10.385
as being an element of our layout.
262

262

00:13:10.385  -->  00:13:13.618
So, simply just a question of how we name things here,
263

263

00:13:13.618  -->  00:13:15.869
but I like to say that it's layout.
264

264

00:13:15.869  -->  00:13:18.947
So, I create a file in the layout folder.
265

265

00:13:18.947  -->  00:13:23.114
Then, of course, I have to include it in here as well.
266

266

00:13:24.715  -->  00:13:25.632
So, import,
267

267

00:13:28.509  -->  00:13:30.176
layout, then header.
268

268

00:13:31.231  -->  00:13:33.429
Now, all of this process might seem a bit
269

269

00:13:33.429  -->  00:13:37.302
cumbersome to you, a bit boring and a bit too much work,
270

270

00:13:37.302  -->  00:13:40.679
but, of course, ideally you start by doing this right
271

271

00:13:40.679  -->  00:13:43.098
from the beginning. You will start to write your css
272

272

00:13:43.098  -->  00:13:45.917
the way we did it, and then you'll sort everything
273

273

00:13:45.917  -->  00:13:47.213
into these folders.
274

274

00:13:47.213  -->  00:13:49.755
Now, ideally, you'll start right from the beginning
275

275

00:13:49.755  -->  00:13:52.012
of the project by having this organization
276

276

00:13:52.012  -->  00:13:54.126
and this is architecture. Right?
277

277

00:13:54.126  -->  00:13:56.054
This is just because I didn't want to start the course
278

278

00:13:56.054  -->  00:13:59.180
with this difficult stuff, with this more confusing stuff;
279

279

00:13:59.180  -->  00:14:01.321
I just wanted to start the course with coding.
280

280

00:14:01.321  -->  00:14:04.853
So, now we have to quickly go through this process
281

281

00:14:04.853  -->  00:14:09.271
and convert everything to this new architecture. OK?
282

282

00:14:09.271  -->  00:14:10.457
Now, what else do we have?
283

283

00:14:10.457  -->  00:14:12.257
The heading primary, and that's it.
284

284

00:14:12.257  -->  00:14:15.786
So, the heading primary, I will classify it
285

285

00:14:15.786  -->  00:14:19.653
as being an element or for typography. OK?
286

286

00:14:19.653  -->  00:14:22.570
So, let's open this typography here
287

287

00:14:23.434  -->  00:14:24.821
and put this here.
288

288

00:14:24.821  -->  00:14:27.188
So, again you could argue that this is a component
289

289

00:14:27.188  -->  00:14:29.453
and I couldn't say that you are wrong,
290

290

00:14:29.453  -->  00:14:31.082
but I like to organize this piece of code
291

291

00:14:31.082  -->  00:14:33.913
here into my typography file,
292

292

00:14:33.913  -->  00:14:36.668
because it's really really related to typography
293

293

00:14:36.668  -->  00:14:38.461
in this case and so this seems to the
294

294

00:14:38.461  -->  00:14:40.249
most intuitive place for me when
295

295

00:14:40.249  -->  00:14:42.702
I will be looking for the heading.
296

296

00:14:42.702  -->  00:14:45.368
Alright, and something else that you should do
297

297

00:14:45.368  -->  00:14:47.354
is if you look at this base here,
298

298

00:14:47.354  -->  00:14:49.600
you will see that we also have a lot
299

299

00:14:49.600  -->  00:14:51.634
of typography stuff in here.
300

300

00:14:51.634  -->  00:14:53.770
So, actually, we should move this to typography.
301

301

00:14:53.770  -->  00:14:55.879
So, everything that is typography related
302

302

00:14:55.879  -->  00:14:58.712
we should have right in this file.
303

303

00:14:59.853  -->  00:15:01.452
So this entire code here, not all of the code,
304

304

00:15:01.452  -->  00:15:03.770
but everything except this one here,
305

305

00:15:03.770  -->  00:15:06.520
should go to the typography here.
306

306

00:15:08.465  -->  00:15:11.132
So, everything except this part.
307

307

00:15:12.171  -->  00:15:17.114
So then here, we just delete everything except this one.
308

308

00:15:17.114  -->  00:15:19.001
OK, so everything that is related to
309

309

00:15:19.001  -->  00:15:21.168
typography is now in here.
310

310

00:15:24.995  -->  00:15:26.845
Now you could argue once more that
311

311

00:15:26.845  -->  00:15:28.659
this font size here is also for a typography,
312

312

00:15:28.659  -->  00:15:31.660
and while I also agree with that, we saw before
313

313

00:15:31.660  -->  00:15:34.268
when we did our conversion to RAMS
314

314

00:15:34.268  -->  00:15:36.126
that this acts more like an overall setting
315

315

00:15:36.126  -->  00:15:39.369
for how we size our entire page. Right?
316

316

00:15:39.369  -->  00:15:41.494
So, I don't see this as much as typography.
317

317

00:15:41.494  -->  00:15:44.828
I see this more like a base definition,
318

318

00:15:44.828  -->  00:15:47.118
a global definition which defines
319

319

00:15:47.118  -->  00:15:49.252
what one RAM should be.
320

320

00:15:49.252  -->  00:15:52.064
Let me actually write it down here. OK.
321

321

00:15:52.064  -->  00:15:54.814
This defines what one one RAM is,
322

322

00:15:56.067  -->  00:15:57.566
and that's why I'm going to leave it here,
323

323

00:15:57.566  -->  00:15:59.168
because that's what it is really.
324

324

00:15:59.168  -->  00:16:00.849
So, we have a reset here,
325

325

00:16:00.849  -->  00:16:03.459
and this box sizing is actually part of it,
326

326

00:16:03.459  -->  00:16:06.514
and then here is overall one RAM setting
327

327

00:16:06.514  -->  00:16:08.487
is also here in our base.
328

328

00:16:08.487  -->  00:16:11.040
So we have base animations, we have typography,
329

329

00:16:11.040  -->  00:16:13.452
then we're going to add some utilities here later.
330

330

00:16:13.452  -->  00:16:15.940
We already have one component, we have one
331

331

00:16:15.940  -->  00:16:17.738
piece of the layout, homes is still
332

332

00:16:17.738  -->  00:16:22.261
empty right now, variables, mixins, and we don't
333

333

00:16:22.261  -->  00:16:24.540
have any mixins yet, and also no function.
334

334

00:16:24.540  -->  00:16:27.373
So let's leave them empty for now.
335

335

00:16:28.620  -->  00:16:31.230
So, this package jason, I can also close it.
336

336

00:16:31.230  -->  00:16:34.230
This one as well. This one and okay.
337

337

00:16:35.770  -->  00:16:38.958
So, don't need any of this and alright.
338

338

00:16:38.958  -->  00:16:41.101
So that is our architecture.
339

339

00:16:41.101  -->  00:16:43.049
So again, you might not need all of these
340

340

00:16:43.049  -->  00:16:44.886
different files and folders for
341

341

00:16:44.886  -->  00:16:47.516
a really small project like this one,
342

342

00:16:47.516  -->  00:16:49.451
but I really want you to get used to the structure,
343

343

00:16:49.451  -->  00:16:52.350
because if you don't organize you SASS files like this,
344

344

00:16:52.350  -->  00:16:54.299
if you just have a bunch of unrelated files
345

345

00:16:54.299  -->  00:16:56.245
or even everything in just one file
346

346

00:16:56.245  -->  00:16:58.491
it will become a real nightmare when
347

347

00:16:58.491  -->  00:17:00.907
you someday have to maintain all this code.
348

348

00:17:00.907  -->  00:17:03.316
Imagine if you have ten thousand lines of code one day
349

349

00:17:03.316  -->  00:17:05.345
and then you want to maintain all of this,
350

350

00:17:05.345  -->  00:17:07.644
you want to change something very deep
351

351

00:17:07.644  -->  00:17:09.904
in the code and then it will be really difficult.
352

352

00:17:09.904  -->  00:17:12.280
So it's always best to start this from the beginning
353

353

00:17:12.280  -->  00:17:14.547
and then keep using this system all
354

354

00:17:14.547  -->  00:17:16.226
throughout the project.
355

355

00:17:16.226  -->  00:17:18.050
That's what I wanted to show you in this lecture
356

356

00:17:18.050  -->  00:17:20.259
and overall in this entire course really,
357

357

00:17:20.259  -->  00:17:22.665
because I have been talking a lot about maintenance
358

358

00:17:22.665  -->  00:17:24.503
and all that stuff because it's really important
359

359

00:17:24.503  -->  00:17:26.426
for a professional css developer like
360

360

00:17:26.426  -->  00:17:28.093
you want to become.
