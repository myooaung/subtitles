<v Instructor>In this lecture you will learn</v>
2

2

00:00:02,730  -->  00:00:04,976
what the new fractional unit is
3

3

00:00:04,976  -->  00:00:08,562
and why it is so useful in CSS Grids.
4

4

00:00:08,562  -->  00:00:11,976
So first off I want to show you that we can do a bit better
5

5

00:00:11,976  -->  00:00:14,383
than having to define all of these rows here
6

6

00:00:14,383  -->  00:00:15,523
one by one.
7

7

00:00:15,523  -->  00:00:17,511
So image that we had five rows
8

8

00:00:17,511  -->  00:00:19,704
each of them with 150 pixels.
9

9

00:00:19,704  -->  00:00:22,531
It wouldn't be really helpful to having to define
10

10

00:00:22,531  -->  00:00:25,149
all of them one by one like this, right.
11

11

00:00:25,149  -->  00:00:27,478
That's why instead in CSS Grid
12

12

00:00:27,478  -->  00:00:30,396
we get a new function called repeat.
13

13

00:00:30,396  -->  00:00:33,208
So let me show it to you, how it works.
14

14

00:00:33,208  -->  00:00:36,458
So all we have to do is to write repeat
15

15

00:00:38,676  -->  00:00:42,627
then the number of rows or columns that we want.
16

16

00:00:42,627  -->  00:00:45,900
So two and then we want both
17

17

00:00:45,900  -->  00:00:50,004
with 150 pixels and that's it.
18

18

00:00:50,004  -->  00:00:52,588
So you'll see that we're back to having two rows here,
19

19

00:00:52,588  -->  00:00:54,869
each of them with 150 pixels.
20

20

00:00:54,869  -->  00:00:57,352
So that is exactly the same
21

21

00:00:57,352  -->  00:01:01,538
as writing 150 and 150 as we had before,
22

22

00:01:01,538  -->  00:01:04,709
and the same of course could be done down here.
23

23

00:01:04,709  -->  00:01:07,294
So let's get rid of this,
24

24

00:01:07,294  -->  00:01:11,211
repeat three and 150 pixels.
25

25

00:01:12,113  -->  00:01:14,740
So let's see, and all right.
26

26

00:01:14,740  -->  00:01:16,665
It looks just as before.
27

27

00:01:16,665  -->  00:01:18,944
Now image we want it to have the third column
28

28

00:01:18,944  -->  00:01:21,907
with 300 pixels and not 150.
29

29

00:01:21,907  -->  00:01:23,333
How would you do that?
30

30

00:01:23,333  -->  00:01:25,342
Well very simple actually.
31

31

00:01:25,342  -->  00:01:27,758
So just change this one here to two
32

32

00:01:27,758  -->  00:01:29,788
and then we can add whatever we want here.
33

33

00:01:29,788  -->  00:01:32,314
So let's say 300 pixels
34

34

00:01:32,314  -->  00:01:34,821
and let's wait, and here we are.
35

35

00:01:34,821  -->  00:01:37,443
So what this does is that basically
36

36

00:01:37,443  -->  00:01:39,196
where it says repeat two
37

37

00:01:39,196  -->  00:01:41,767
it creates these two column tracks
38

38

00:01:41,767  -->  00:01:45,106
with 150 pixels each and then
39

39

00:01:45,106  -->  00:01:47,842
the third one with 300 pixels, right.
40

40

00:01:47,842  -->  00:01:49,909
So remember again from the first lecture
41

41

00:01:49,909  -->  00:01:52,280
that these are called the tracks, right.
42

42

00:01:52,280  -->  00:01:55,672
So what we do here is to create two tracks
43

43

00:01:55,672  -->  00:01:59,305
for the rows and three tracks for the columns, right.
44

44

00:01:59,305  -->  00:02:01,386
So again, this is a track here,
45

45

00:02:01,386  -->  00:02:04,123
this is a track, this one is a track,
46

46

00:02:04,123  -->  00:02:06,154
and here and here.
47

47

00:02:06,154  -->  00:02:08,623
Now what if you wanted to make this last column here
48

48

00:02:08,623  -->  00:02:11,252
occupy the rest of our red container,
49

49

00:02:11,252  -->  00:02:12,595
because we see right now there's
50

50

00:02:12,595  -->  00:02:15,184
a lot of empty space here still, right.
51

51

00:02:15,184  -->  00:02:17,324
So how could we fill this up?
52

52

00:02:17,324  -->  00:02:19,461
So this is a bit similar to Flexbox
53

53

00:02:19,461  -->  00:02:22,518
where we had, remember, the flex property
54

54

00:02:22,518  -->  00:02:24,444
which if we would set it to one
55

55

00:02:24,444  -->  00:02:28,880
it would basically expand and occupy all the possible space.
56

56

00:02:28,880  -->  00:02:31,245
Now here in Grid we don't have a property like that,
57

57

00:02:31,245  -->  00:02:33,710
but we have a similar functionality.
58

58

00:02:33,710  -->  00:02:35,618
So let me show you how.
59

59

00:02:35,618  -->  00:02:37,070
So what we're going to use
60

60

00:02:37,070  -->  00:02:39,713
is the brand new unit that was introduced
61

61

00:02:39,713  -->  00:02:43,663
with CSS Grids, which is called a fractional unit.
62

62

00:02:43,663  -->  00:02:48,475
So I can write one fractional unit like this.
63

63

00:02:48,475  -->  00:02:52,246
So fr and what it does is that it expands
64

64

00:02:52,246  -->  00:02:54,734
to all the space that it can occupy.
65

65

00:02:54,734  -->  00:02:57,814
So in this case it occupies all the remaining space.
66

66

00:02:57,814  -->  00:02:59,855
Okay, does that make sense?
67

67

00:02:59,855  -->  00:03:02,595
So let's take a look again at what happens here.
68

68

00:03:02,595  -->  00:03:05,170
So we defined the three column tracks.
69

69

00:03:05,170  -->  00:03:07,682
So the first one will have 150 pixels,
70

70

00:03:07,682  -->  00:03:10,106
the second one 150 as well,
71

71

00:03:10,106  -->  00:03:12,977
and the last one is one fractional unit.
72

72

00:03:12,977  -->  00:03:14,644
The fractional unit represents
73

73

00:03:14,644  -->  00:03:16,731
a fraction of the available space
74

74

00:03:16,731  -->  00:03:18,484
and so it takes all of that up
75

75

00:03:18,484  -->  00:03:21,462
when we set it here to one fr.
76

76

00:03:21,462  -->  00:03:24,340
Okay, so fr is very, very handy.
77

77

00:03:24,340  -->  00:03:27,128
Let me actually show you a different way of using it,
78

78

00:03:27,128  -->  00:03:28,983
so a different application, let's say.
79

79

00:03:28,983  -->  00:03:31,696
So let's create some new column tracks here.
80

80

00:03:31,696  -->  00:03:35,868
So I'm commenting out these ones so that you can keep them
81

81

00:03:35,868  -->  00:03:38,319
in the code for reference.
82

82

00:03:38,319  -->  00:03:42,054
So grid template, columns
83

83

00:03:42,054  -->  00:03:44,023
and let's say we want all of the three columns
84

84

00:03:44,023  -->  00:03:45,819
to have the same size.
85

85

00:03:45,819  -->  00:03:48,170
How do you think we would do that?
86

86

00:03:48,170  -->  00:03:51,852
Well we can use our repeat function.
87

87

00:03:51,852  -->  00:03:56,506
Say we want three tracks each of them with one fr,
88

88

00:03:56,506  -->  00:03:57,673
and that's it.
89

89

00:03:58,516  -->  00:04:00,716
So again, one fr
90

90

00:04:00,716  -->  00:04:03,238
is a fraction of the available space.
91

91

00:04:03,238  -->  00:04:07,071
In this case each of them, each of these three column tracks
92

92

00:04:07,071  -->  00:04:08,933
has the same width, right.
93

93

00:04:08,933  -->  00:04:10,720
So each of them is one fr.
94

94

00:04:10,720  -->  00:04:13,264
So with this we can divide the entire space
95

95

00:04:13,264  -->  00:04:14,863
in three parts.
96

96

00:04:14,863  -->  00:04:17,028
Okay, does that make sense?
97

97

00:04:17,028  -->  00:04:18,621
Maybe to understand it even better
98

98

00:04:18,621  -->  00:04:21,011
let me show it to you in another way yet.
99

99

00:04:21,011  -->  00:04:23,461
So let's say we want the first one
100

100

00:04:23,461  -->  00:04:25,424
to be one fractional unit,
101

101

00:04:25,424  -->  00:04:28,121
the second one two fractional units,
102

102

00:04:28,121  -->  00:04:31,523
and the last one one fractional unit as well.
103

103

00:04:31,523  -->  00:04:33,687
So what do you think will happen?
104

104

00:04:33,687  -->  00:04:35,869
Okay, and so that's the result.
105

105

00:04:35,869  -->  00:04:37,933
So you see that this one here the one in the middle,
106

106

00:04:37,933  -->  00:04:39,921
the column in the middle, the second one
107

107

00:04:39,921  -->  00:04:44,239
is now double the size of the first one and the last one.
108

108

00:04:44,239  -->  00:04:45,593
So why is that?
109

109

00:04:45,593  -->  00:04:48,379
Well that's because two is double of one.
110

110

00:04:48,379  -->  00:04:51,101
So all the empty space here is divided
111

111

00:04:51,101  -->  00:04:53,317
and then two of the fractions are assigned
112

112

00:04:53,317  -->  00:04:55,872
to the second column and then one
113

113

00:04:55,872  -->  00:04:57,723
is assigned to the first one
114

114

00:04:57,723  -->  00:05:00,339
and one fraction is assigned to the last one.
115

115

00:05:00,339  -->  00:05:02,849
Let's actually inspect this here
116

116

00:05:02,849  -->  00:05:04,717
so we can get the sizes.
117

117

00:05:04,717  -->  00:05:06,760
So the first one you see that it has
118

118

00:05:06,760  -->  00:05:09,623
235 pixels of width.
119

119

00:05:09,623  -->  00:05:11,843
So the second one should have double,
120

120

00:05:11,843  -->  00:05:14,089
which should be 470, right.
121

121

00:05:14,089  -->  00:05:16,681
So let's take a look if that's true,
122

122

00:05:16,681  -->  00:05:18,969
and yeah, so you see it's 470
123

123

00:05:18,969  -->  00:05:21,372
width and 150 height.
124

124

00:05:21,372  -->  00:05:23,412
So that's exactly as predicted,
125

125

00:05:23,412  -->  00:05:26,658
and of course the last one is 235.
126

126

00:05:26,658  -->  00:05:28,731
We can of course take this even further.
127

127

00:05:28,731  -->  00:05:31,096
So let's set this one to three.
128

128

00:05:31,096  -->  00:05:32,504
So what's going to happen now?
129

129

00:05:32,504  -->  00:05:34,823
Of course it's going to get even bigger,
130

130

00:05:34,823  -->  00:05:36,615
because now the available space
131

131

00:05:36,615  -->  00:05:38,938
is basically divided into five parts,
132

132

00:05:38,938  -->  00:05:40,826
three for the column in the middle
133

133

00:05:40,826  -->  00:05:44,511
and one for the left and one for the right column, right.
134

134

00:05:44,511  -->  00:05:46,572
So you see that this fractional unit
135

135

00:05:46,572  -->  00:05:49,131
can actually be very, very helpful, right.
136

136

00:05:49,131  -->  00:05:52,102
That's exactly why it was developed specifically
137

137

00:05:52,102  -->  00:05:54,041
for CSS Grids.
138

138

00:05:54,041  -->  00:05:57,819
We can of course also put this one here two three fr.
139

139

00:05:57,819  -->  00:06:01,150
So now these two are both three times bigger
140

140

00:06:01,150  -->  00:06:03,810
than this first one, right.
141

141

00:06:03,810  -->  00:06:06,356
Now you can play around with this if you want,
142

142

00:06:06,356  -->  00:06:08,908
so to become a bit more familiar with it,
143

143

00:06:08,908  -->  00:06:12,323
because there's actually a lot to explore, right.
144

144

00:06:12,323  -->  00:06:15,133
So let's now set this back to one
145

145

00:06:15,133  -->  00:06:17,326
and let's experiment with something else.
146

146

00:06:17,326  -->  00:06:19,882
For example let's set this one to 50%,
147

147

00:06:19,882  -->  00:06:22,124
because of course we cannot only use pixels
148

148

00:06:22,124  -->  00:06:23,334
and fractional units,
149

149

00:06:23,334  -->  00:06:25,776
we can use all kinds of units here
150

150

00:06:25,776  -->  00:06:28,293
and percentage is no exception.
151

151

00:06:28,293  -->  00:06:30,888
So right now I set it to 50%.
152

152

00:06:30,888  -->  00:06:34,183
So let's inspect the width of this element here
153

153

00:06:34,183  -->  00:06:37,019
and so you see that it has 500 pixels,
154

154

00:06:37,019  -->  00:06:41,108
which is exactly 50% of the 1,000 pixels
155

155

00:06:41,108  -->  00:06:42,988
that the container has, right.
156

156

00:06:42,988  -->  00:06:45,794
So you see it has 1,000 pixels of width
157

157

00:06:45,794  -->  00:06:48,139
and so this item here with 50%
158

158

00:06:48,139  -->  00:06:51,829
so that this entire column has now 500 pixels.
159

159

00:06:51,829  -->  00:06:54,328
So what we see immediately here from that
160

160

00:06:54,328  -->  00:06:56,466
is that this percentage unit here
161

161

00:06:56,466  -->  00:06:59,287
doesn't take the gap into account.
162

162

00:06:59,287  -->  00:07:03,069
Okay, so basically it takes 50% off the entire width
163

163

00:07:03,069  -->  00:07:06,203
and then the rest is for the other columns,
164

164

00:07:06,203  -->  00:07:07,892
but also for the gap.
165

165

00:07:07,892  -->  00:07:10,363
So let's increase for example here this to
166

166

00:07:10,363  -->  00:07:12,877
80 just to see what happens
167

167

00:07:12,877  -->  00:07:14,477
and then you'll see that the first column
168

168

00:07:14,477  -->  00:07:18,221
stays exactly the same and the second and the third column
169

169

00:07:18,221  -->  00:07:21,178
they are the ones that become a bit narrower,
170

170

00:07:21,178  -->  00:07:24,417
because now we need more space here for the gap, right.
171

171

00:07:24,417  -->  00:07:26,607
So the remaining space that's left
172

172

00:07:26,607  -->  00:07:28,753
is of course divided between these two,
173

173

00:07:28,753  -->  00:07:31,729
because they both have a one fractional unit,
174

174

00:07:31,729  -->  00:07:33,689
so this one and this one as well.
175

175

00:07:33,689  -->  00:07:36,059
If I put this one to two, again,
176

176

00:07:36,059  -->  00:07:39,090
you can guess what will happen and so yeah
177

177

00:07:39,090  -->  00:07:43,257
the third column is twice as wide as the second one.
178

178

00:07:44,237  -->  00:07:47,047
Okay, but let's put this back to thirty.
179

179

00:07:47,047  -->  00:07:48,951
I will actually comment this one out here
180

180

00:07:48,951  -->  00:07:51,868
so that you can also keep this code
181

181

00:07:53,622  -->  00:07:57,503
and then put it back to what we had before.
182

182

00:07:57,503  -->  00:08:01,331
So repeat, and then I want to make the three columns
183

183

00:08:01,331  -->  00:08:02,842
all with the same width.
184

184

00:08:02,842  -->  00:08:04,772
So for that, again, we use our
185

185

00:08:04,772  -->  00:08:07,443
fr trick, so fractional unit.
186

186

00:08:07,443  -->  00:08:09,123
So this fractional unit here is something
187

187

00:08:09,123  -->  00:08:10,666
that you will see all the time
188

188

00:08:10,666  -->  00:08:13,201
when using CSS Grids, okay,
189

189

00:08:13,201  -->  00:08:15,308
especially for defining the column tracks,
190

190

00:08:15,308  -->  00:08:16,644
because this is really handy,
191

191

00:08:16,644  -->  00:08:20,345
but actually this also works as well here for the rows.
192

192

00:08:20,345  -->  00:08:23,790
So if we defined like a height for this container.
193

193

00:08:23,790  -->  00:08:27,123
Let me just very quickly show it to you.
194

194

00:08:28,897  -->  00:08:30,783
So let's see the height
195

195

00:08:30,783  -->  00:08:33,301
of the container should be 1,000 pixels,
196

196

00:08:33,301  -->  00:08:35,587
so not 100, 1,000 of course.
197

197

00:08:35,587  -->  00:08:38,835
So you see that now it comes all the way down here
198

198

00:08:38,835  -->  00:08:42,252
and if we now work to put one fr here
199

199

00:08:43,146  -->  00:08:45,820
then, let's wait for it.
200

200

00:08:45,820  -->  00:08:49,143
Okay, now you see that each of the rows occupies
201

201

00:08:49,143  -->  00:08:51,698
all the space it can in order to fill up
202

202

00:08:51,698  -->  00:08:54,754
the entire height of the container, right.
203

203

00:08:54,754  -->  00:08:57,551
So the fr, of course, doesn't only work on columns,
204

204

00:08:57,551  -->  00:09:00,098
but I think it's way more useful there.
205

205

00:09:00,098  -->  00:09:02,350
Okay, and you will see it and you will use it
206

206

00:09:02,350  -->  00:09:04,441
more on the columns.
207

207

00:09:04,441  -->  00:09:07,139
So let's put it back to where it was
208

208

00:09:07,139  -->  00:09:09,413
and comment out this code here,
209

209

00:09:09,413  -->  00:09:12,364
because this here is exactly what we want.
210

210

00:09:12,364  -->  00:09:13,697
All right, so I hope that the
211

211

00:09:13,697  -->  00:09:16,259
fractional unit here made a lot of sense to you
212

212

00:09:16,259  -->  00:09:18,416
and if you need to experiment some more with it
213

213

00:09:18,416  -->  00:09:20,772
then please go ahead, experiment,
214

214

00:09:20,772  -->  00:09:24,447
try to inspect the width of the columns like it did before,
215

215

00:09:24,447  -->  00:09:26,070
and make sure that you understand
216

216

00:09:26,070  -->  00:09:29,319
what the fractional units really represents, okay.
217

217

00:09:29,319  -->  00:09:30,588
Once you're done with that,
218

218

00:09:30,588  -->  00:09:32,172
once you really get it down
219

219

00:09:32,172  -->  00:09:34,060
then we can move on to the next lecture.
220

220

00:09:34,060  -->  00:09:36,576
We're going to learn how to actually position
221

221

00:09:36,576  -->  00:09:40,197
these grid items exactly where you want them on the grid,
222

222

00:09:40,197  -->  00:09:42,560
because right now all of these items
223

223

00:09:42,560  -->  00:09:44,652
they were just automatically placed
224

224

00:09:44,652  -->  00:09:48,005
in the order in which we have them here in the source code,
225

225

00:09:48,005  -->  00:09:50,828
but we can, of course, change that, right.
226

226

00:09:50,828  -->  00:09:52,806
So once you get this part really down
227

227

00:09:52,806  -->  00:09:56,389
let's move on together to the next lecture.
