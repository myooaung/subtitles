00:00:01.338  -->  00:00:03.456
<v ->So we talked about the Cascade</v>
2

2

00:00:03.456  -->  00:00:05.905
and specificity in the last lecture,
3

3

00:00:05.905  -->  00:00:10.113
and these concepts can absolutely be a bit hard to grasp.
4

4

00:00:10.113  -->  00:00:13.018
So let's now look at an example that I prepared for you
5

5

00:00:13.018  -->  00:00:14.690
and which is actually pretty similar
6

6

00:00:14.690  -->  00:00:18.039
to what we looked at in the last lecture.
7

7

00:00:18.039  -->  00:00:20.918
In order to that, let's open a CodePen
8

8

00:00:20.918  -->  00:00:24.622
so that I can quickly experiment with some code.
9

9

00:00:24.622  -->  00:00:27.072
Now, in case you're not familiar with CodePen,
10

10

00:00:27.072  -->  00:00:29.107
it's just a very simple web app
11

11

00:00:29.107  -->  00:00:32.039
where we can input HTML, CSS and JavaScript code
12

12

00:00:32.039  -->  00:00:33.811
and experiment with it,
13

13

00:00:33.811  -->  00:00:38.107
and it will then render the result down here, okay?
14

14

00:00:38.107  -->  00:00:39.791
So if you wanna follow this quick example,
15

15

00:00:39.791  -->  00:00:42.497
then just go to CodePen,
16

16

00:00:42.497  -->  00:00:43.414
codepen.io,
17

17

00:00:45.436  -->  00:00:47.186
and it will probably,
18

18

00:00:48.339  -->  00:00:50.741
yeah so create a new pen.
19

19

00:00:50.741  -->  00:00:52.825
And then you can just copy the codes
20

20

00:00:52.825  -->  00:00:54.440
that I have in my CodePen here.
21

21

00:00:54.440  -->  00:00:57.018
So just pause the video and copy the code if you want,
22

22

00:00:57.018  -->  00:01:00.303
but I think it's not really necessary if you don't wanna.
23

23

00:01:00.303  -->  00:01:03.193
You can just watch me explaining stuff here
24

24

00:01:03.193  -->  00:01:06.422
in this CodePen that I have prepared already.
25

25

00:01:06.422  -->  00:01:08.539
So this is again, similar to the example
26

26

00:01:08.539  -->  00:01:10.108
that we had in the previous slide.
27

27

00:01:10.108  -->  00:01:12.999
So down here we have the "don't click" button.
28

28

00:01:12.999  -->  00:01:14.758
So we have four selectors here
29

29

00:01:14.758  -->  00:01:16.935
that actually select this button
30

30

00:01:16.935  -->  00:01:19.494
and try to give it a different background color.
31

31

00:01:19.494  -->  00:01:21.950
So it's simply at the button class selector here,
32

32

00:01:21.950  -->  00:01:24.597
then we have to anchor element selector.
33

33

00:01:24.597  -->  00:01:27.579
We have this huge crazy selector here,
34

34

00:01:27.579  -->  00:01:29.237
and then we have this one here
35

35

00:01:29.237  -->  00:01:31.631
which actually has a hover pseudo class.
36

36

00:01:31.631  -->  00:01:33.133
So let's see what happens.
37

37

00:01:33.133  -->  00:01:34.388
So as we already saw,
38

38

00:01:34.388  -->  00:01:36.937
this one has a pretty low specificity, right?
39

39

00:01:36.937  -->  00:01:38.957
Because it has just one class.
40

40

00:01:38.957  -->  00:01:40.779
And this one here, even worse.
41

41

00:01:40.779  -->  00:01:44.228
This is almost like the lowest specificity possible.
42

42

00:01:44.228  -->  00:01:47.809
And so these blue and purple color, there's almost no way
43

43

00:01:47.809  -->  00:01:51.871
that we can have this color here on the button.
44

44

00:01:51.871  -->  00:01:54.304
But there is one way though, right? Remember?
45

45

00:01:54.304  -->  00:01:56.808
Because even if the specificity is really low,
46

46

00:01:56.808  -->  00:01:59.611
we can give these declarations a higher importance,
47

47

00:01:59.611  -->  00:02:01.812
and then the specificity doesn't even matter
48

48

00:02:01.812  -->  00:02:04.898
because if they're more important, they will be applied.
49

49

00:02:04.898  -->  00:02:09.096
And so for example, if we put an "important" here
50

50

00:02:09.096  -->  00:02:12.004
and wait till it updates, then here, right,
51

51

00:02:12.004  -->  00:02:14.616
we have the purple color that we specified here.
52

52

00:02:14.616  -->  00:02:17.460
And so now, even with the lowest specificity possible,
53

53

00:02:17.460  -->  00:02:19.624
we have the purple background color simply because
54

54

00:02:19.624  -->  00:02:24.078
we made this declaration more important than all the others.
55

55

00:02:24.078  -->  00:02:28.245
And the same thing will of course work if we put it here.
56

56

00:02:30.673  -->  00:02:33.399
Just to show it to you. Of course it turns blue.
57

57

00:02:33.399  -->  00:02:35.728
Now I already mentioned that we shouldn't really use
58

58

00:02:35.728  -->  00:02:38.411
this "important" unless there is something really weird
59

59

00:02:38.411  -->  00:02:39.855
going on in your code.
60

60

00:02:39.855  -->  00:02:41.662
But usually if you need to use "important,
61

61

00:02:41.662  -->  00:02:43.517
then that's a pretty bad sign,
62

62

00:02:43.517  -->  00:02:46.107
and you should probably go back and refactor your code
63

63

00:02:46.107  -->  00:02:48.300
and change some stuff in there.
64

64

00:02:48.300  -->  00:02:50.282
Now what I really wanted to show you though
65

65

00:02:50.282  -->  00:02:52.933
is these two selectors down here.
66

66

00:02:52.933  -->  00:02:54.984
So you see that currently this declaration here
67

67

00:02:54.984  -->  00:02:57.434
is the one that applies because this selector
68

68

00:02:57.434  -->  00:03:00.807
is the one with the highest specificity of these three,
69

69

00:03:00.807  -->  00:03:02.390
not counting this one here right now
70

70

00:03:02.390  -->  00:03:04.427
because it's on a hover state.
71

71

00:03:04.427  -->  00:03:06.559
So this is supposed to only turn yellow
72

72

00:03:06.559  -->  00:03:08.579
when we hover the button.
73

73

00:03:08.579  -->  00:03:11.016
Now, what actually happens when we now hover the button.
74

74

00:03:11.016  -->  00:03:12.811
Let's try it out.
75

75

00:03:12.811  -->  00:03:15.242
And it doesn't turn yellow, right?
76

76

00:03:15.242  -->  00:03:16.898
Even though it's specified here
77

77

00:03:16.898  -->  00:03:20.178
that the button when it's hovered should turn yellow.
78

78

00:03:20.178  -->  00:03:21.785
So why is that happening?
79

79

00:03:21.785  -->  00:03:24.384
And it is happening for a very simple reason
80

80

00:03:24.384  -->  00:03:26.111
because remember that pseudo classes
81

81

00:03:26.111  -->  00:03:28.880
also count into the specificity,
82

82

00:03:28.880  -->  00:03:32.130
so this one here counts one into specificity.
83

83

00:03:32.130  -->  00:03:35.117
Now if we do the Math of this selector,
84

84

00:03:35.117  -->  00:03:38.619
which has one iD such as this one,
85

85

00:03:38.619  -->  00:03:39.452
it has one
86

86

00:03:40.479  -->  00:03:42.503
and two classes,
87

87

00:03:42.503  -->  00:03:44.838
and this is also one and two classes
88

88

00:03:44.838  -->  00:03:47.455
because this one counts as if it was a class.
89

89

00:03:47.455  -->  00:03:52.215
But then this one has two elements, and this only has one.
90

90

00:03:52.215  -->  00:03:54.806
And therefore, this selector here is more specific.
91

91

00:03:54.806  -->  00:03:57.476
So again, there's the same amount of iDs,
92

92

00:03:57.476  -->  00:03:59.402
the same amount of classes,
93

93

00:03:59.402  -->  00:04:03.494
but this one here has two more elements, "div" and "a",
94

94

00:04:03.494  -->  00:04:05.328
while this one only has one.
95

95

00:04:05.328  -->  00:04:08.523
And so, no matter if it says hover or whatever it says here,
96

96

00:04:08.523  -->  00:04:10.171
this one is more specific
97

97

00:04:10.171  -->  00:04:13.002
and therefore is the one that applies, not this one.
98

98

00:04:13.002  -->  00:04:14.722
No matter if you hover it or not,
99

99

00:04:14.722  -->  00:04:18.187
the specificity is lower and so it cannot be applied.
100

100

00:04:18.187  -->  00:04:20.842
If we want the background color to be yellow,
101

101

00:04:20.842  -->  00:04:23.175
then we will need a selector
102

102

00:04:24.052  -->  00:04:26.757
which has an even higher specificity.
103

103

00:04:26.757  -->  00:04:28.254
So let's just copy this one here.
104

104

00:04:28.254  -->  00:04:32.550
So hover here says something else like "green".
105

105

00:04:32.550  -->  00:04:35.308
Let's see what happens now. And now it turns green.
106

106

00:04:35.308  -->  00:04:37.641
And that's because now, this selector here
107

107

00:04:37.641  -->  00:04:40.631
has a higher specificity than this one, right?
108

108

00:04:40.631  -->  00:04:42.587
Because of course, this one here,
109

109

00:04:42.587  -->  00:04:43.876
this part is the same as this.
110

110

00:04:43.876  -->  00:04:45.884
But then we add one pseudo class
111

111

00:04:45.884  -->  00:04:48.750
and so all of a sudden this one here is more specific
112

112

00:04:48.750  -->  00:04:50.383
and then it applies.
113

113

00:04:50.383  -->  00:04:52.781
So you see that not only we have to make sure
114

114

00:04:52.781  -->  00:04:55.114
that we have the hover pseudo class in place
115

115

00:04:55.114  -->  00:04:56.484
if you want a hover effect,
116

116

00:04:56.484  -->  00:04:59.386
also the selector should have a higher specificity
117

117

00:04:59.386  -->  00:05:03.636
than the original one, which in this case is this one.
118

118

00:05:03.636  -->  00:05:04.976
This usually isn't a problem,
119

119

00:05:04.976  -->  00:05:07.720
but I believe I had it happen to me a couple of times
120

120

00:05:07.720  -->  00:05:11.240
that I was writing some really complex navigation
121

121

00:05:11.240  -->  00:05:12.709
in one of my sites,
122

122

00:05:12.709  -->  00:05:14.572
and all of a sudden the hovers weren't working,
123

123

00:05:14.572  -->  00:05:18.061
and nothing was really working as I was expecting.
124

124

00:05:18.061  -->  00:05:19.541
And so I had to learn it the hard way
125

125

00:05:19.541  -->  00:05:23.575
by experimenting a lot and finding out why it didn't work.
126

126

00:05:23.575  -->  00:05:25.745
So that's why I'm warning you here
127

127

00:05:25.745  -->  00:05:28.946
that you should be careful with your selector specificities.
128

128

00:05:28.946  -->  00:05:31.134
So it's really important that you keep this in mind
129

129

00:05:31.134  -->  00:05:34.455
in case something isn't working the way you expect.
130

130

00:05:34.455  -->  00:05:36.063
Alright, and I hope that with this,
131

131

00:05:36.063  -->  00:05:38.766
you now really understood how specificity
132

132

00:05:38.766  -->  00:05:40.415
is an important work
133

133

00:05:40.415  -->  00:05:42.250
so that you can write better codes in future
134

134

00:05:42.250  -->  00:05:44.532
and also be able to debug your code
135

135

00:05:44.532  -->  00:05:46.918
in case something isn't working properly.
136

136

00:05:46.918  -->  00:05:51.085
It's also a really important skill when you're writing CSS.
