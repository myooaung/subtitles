00:00:00.543  -->  00:00:02.673
<v Jonas>Hello. What's up?</v>
2

2

00:00:02.673  -->  00:00:05.608
I see you're still with me there, and you cannot imagine
3

3

00:00:05.608  -->  00:00:07.848
how much I appreciate that.
4

4

00:00:07.848  -->  00:00:10.993
So, here I have yet another section, full-packed
5

5

00:00:10.993  -->  00:00:13.036
with new stuff for you.
6

6

00:00:13.036  -->  00:00:15.108
And, what we're gonna build in this section
7

7

00:00:15.108  -->  00:00:17.195
is a beautifully styled form,
8

8

00:00:17.195  -->  00:00:19.551
with a lot of complex CSS going on.
9

9

00:00:19.551  -->  00:00:22.087
So, you're gonna learn how to implement something
10

10

00:00:22.087  -->  00:00:24.595
I call the solid-color gradient.
11

11

00:00:24.595  -->  00:00:26.780
Also, you'll learn: how the general and adjacent
12

12

00:00:26.780  -->  00:00:29.584
sibling selectors work and why we need them;
13

13

00:00:29.584  -->  00:00:33.104
how to use the input-placeholder pseudo-element;
14

14

00:00:33.104  -->  00:00:35.652
how and when to use the focus, invalid
15

15

00:00:35.652  -->  00:00:38.863
and placeholder-shown and checked pseudo-classes
16

16

00:00:38.863  -->  00:00:43.053
for styling forms; and finally, to finish this section
17

17

00:00:43.053  -->  00:00:45.735
you're gonna use all that knowledge to build custom
18

18

00:00:45.735  -->  00:00:49.575
radio buttons, to give our form a special touch.
19

19

00:00:49.575  -->  00:00:52.030
So, taking a look at what we're gonna build here,
20

20

00:00:52.030  -->  00:00:53.196
this is it.
21

21

00:00:53.196  -->  00:00:56.784
So, this entire section with this background gradient
22

22

00:00:56.784  -->  00:00:59.673
here going on, and then this box, where the form
23

23

00:00:59.673  -->  00:01:01.644
is then actually located.
24

24

00:01:01.644  -->  00:01:04.159
So, we have this box with this background image,
25

25

00:01:04.159  -->  00:01:07.657
then this here is what I call the solid-color gradient.
26

26

00:01:07.657  -->  00:01:09.166
But, we'll see that a bit later.
27

27

00:01:09.166  -->  00:01:11.938
So, let's now start by actually formatting
28

28

00:01:11.938  -->  00:01:14.521
this entire section with the background gradient
29

29

00:01:14.521  -->  00:01:17.050
and then implementing this box here first,
30

30

00:01:17.050  -->  00:01:18.887
including the background image
31

31

00:01:18.887  -->  00:01:22.412
and this non-rectangular design thing here again. Okay?
32

32

00:01:22.412  -->  00:01:25.105
So, this is again the same styles we had before
33

33

00:01:25.105  -->  00:01:27.522
so, such as these edges here,
34

34

00:01:28.697  -->  00:01:31.173
or these edges here on the cards.
35

35

00:01:31.173  -->  00:01:32.722
This edge here.
36

36

00:01:32.722  -->  00:01:36.259
So, once again we use that design element in here. Okay?
37

37

00:01:36.259  -->  00:01:38.092
So, let's get to work.
38

38

00:01:39.664  -->  00:01:42.277
So, we start by adding a new section.
39

39

00:01:42.277  -->  00:01:44.810
(keyboard clicks)
40

40

00:01:44.810  -->  00:01:47.444
(keyboard clicks)
41

41

00:01:47.444  -->  00:01:50.740
At this one is the the booking section.
42

42

00:01:50.740  -->  00:01:53.598
So, let's simply call it section book,
43

43

00:01:53.598  -->  00:01:56.135
then in here, we have a row, okay,
44

44

00:01:56.135  -->  00:01:59.679
because you want to center that box nicely in the middle.
45

45

00:01:59.679  -->  00:02:01.414
And, then in there I'm going to place
46

46

00:02:01.414  -->  00:02:03.899
an element called book. Okay?
47

47

00:02:03.899  -->  00:02:08.113
So, this book here will be this entire box. Okay?
48

48

00:02:08.113  -->  00:02:11.094
Now, why am I doing it this way?
49

49

00:02:11.094  -->  00:02:13.054
Well, let's think about reusable pieces
50

50

00:02:13.054  -->  00:02:14.737
and components again.
51

51

00:02:14.737  -->  00:02:18.251
I think it's only logical, that we make this form here
52

52

00:02:18.251  -->  00:02:20.202
to be a component, so that we could reuse it
53

53

00:02:20.202  -->  00:02:21.801
somewhere else on the page.
54

54

00:02:21.801  -->  00:02:23.789
So, all these elements here, that we're gonna code,
55

55

00:02:23.789  -->  00:02:26.455
these all should be part of our component.
56

56

00:02:26.455  -->  00:02:29.320
So, we will probably have a component called form.
57

57

00:02:29.320  -->  00:02:31.199
Now, what will be unique to this page,
58

58

00:02:31.199  -->  00:02:33.425
and what we really don't need to reuse, I think,
59

59

00:02:33.425  -->  00:02:35.598
is the rest of the design, like this box here
60

60

00:02:35.598  -->  00:02:37.326
with this background image and also
61

61

00:02:37.326  -->  00:02:39.993
with this edge here going on.
62

62

00:02:39.993  -->  00:02:42.645
So, that's not really a reusable piece, I believe.
63

63

00:02:42.645  -->  00:02:44.543
Because, imagine that we have another page
64

64

00:02:44.543  -->  00:02:47.392
with the form somewhere else, maybe even without occupying
65

65

00:02:47.392  -->  00:02:49.563
the entire width here, of the page.
66

66

00:02:49.563  -->  00:02:52.214
Imagine just like a small contact form somewhere on the page
67

67

00:02:52.214  -->  00:02:55.201
and maybe we would want to reuse the form,
68

68

00:02:55.201  -->  00:02:57.718
like these pieces here but not this entire thing
69

69

00:02:57.718  -->  00:02:59.394
with this entire background image
70

70

00:02:59.394  -->  00:03:01.427
and occupying all this space. Right?
71

71

00:03:01.427  -->  00:03:03.499
So, what we're gonna do is to add all of these tiles
72

72

00:03:03.499  -->  00:03:05.519
that are unique to the home page here,
73

73

00:03:05.519  -->  00:03:07.757
once more to our home file.
74

74

00:03:07.757  -->  00:03:09.756
And, then the form itself here,
75

75

00:03:09.756  -->  00:03:11.858
that's what will be a component. Okay?
76

76

00:03:11.858  -->  00:03:12.916
So, let's go back now.
77

77

00:03:12.916  -->  00:03:15.384
And, that's why I call this here book, and then the
78

78

00:03:15.384  -->  00:03:19.478
component later on is what will have the name of a form.
79

79

00:03:19.478  -->  00:03:22.036
Alright. But, before doing that, let's actually start
80

80

00:03:22.036  -->  00:03:26.384
by styling the section book, as well as the book class here.
81

81

00:03:26.384  -->  00:03:29.425
So, in the home folder, put it here in the beginning
82

82

00:03:29.425  -->  00:03:31.366
and close this one here, actually.
83

83

00:03:31.366  -->  00:03:34.425
(keyboard clicks)
84

84

00:03:34.425  -->  00:03:36.827
So, here at the end,
85

85

00:03:36.827  -->  00:03:38.460
just add a new selector.
86

86

00:03:38.460  -->  00:03:40.095
(keyboard clicks)
87

87

00:03:40.095  -->  00:03:44.178
So, we want the padding of again, 15rem and zero.
88

88

00:03:45.315  -->  00:03:48.090
And now, you saw that we had that gradient going on,
89

89

00:03:48.090  -->  00:03:50.298
so, background-image.
90

90

00:03:50.298  -->  00:03:52.789
(keyboard clicks)
91

91

00:03:52.789  -->  00:03:57.073
Bringing our gradient to right bottom again.
92

92

00:03:57.073  -->  00:03:59.292
(keyboard clicks)
93

93

00:03:59.292  -->  00:04:01.025
Well, this here is not correct.
94

94

00:04:01.025  -->  00:04:04.139
(keyboard clicks)
95

95

00:04:04.139  -->  00:04:05.722
And now the colors.
96

96

00:04:07.201  -->  00:04:09.728
So, color-primary-light.
97

97

00:04:09.728  -->  00:04:12.998
(keyboard clicks)
98

98

00:04:12.998  -->  00:04:15.089
And, color-primary-dark.
99

99

00:04:15.089  -->  00:04:18.297
(keyboard clicks)
100

100

00:04:18.297  -->  00:04:21.130
(keyboard clicks)
101

101

00:04:22.438  -->  00:04:25.057
And now, the book class, which is remember that box
102

102

00:04:25.057  -->  00:04:26.882
with the background-image.
103

103

00:04:26.882  -->  00:04:29.064
(keyboard clicks)
104

104

00:04:29.064  -->  00:04:32.139
So, let's actually start by adding that background-image.
105

105

00:04:32.139  -->  00:04:34.649
So, url move up one level.
106

106

00:04:34.649  -->  00:04:37.629
Img, and this one is called nat-10.
107

107

00:04:37.629  -->  00:04:40.462
(keyboard clicks)
108

108

00:04:42.065  -->  00:04:44.982
And, the background-size, of cover.
109

109

00:04:46.348  -->  00:04:48.096
(keyboard clicks)
110

110

00:04:48.096  -->  00:04:50.004
Now, one thing that I didn't mention yet,
111

111

00:04:50.004  -->  00:04:52.873
is that actually instead of using a cubrid like cover,
112

112

00:04:52.873  -->  00:04:56.925
we can also use a value here like 100%.
113

113

00:04:56.925  -->  00:04:58.499
And, actually, 100% here means
114

114

00:04:58.499  -->  00:05:01.122
the exact same thing as cover.
115

115

00:05:01.122  -->  00:05:03.458
And, that's because cover stretches the image to occupy
116

116

00:05:03.458  -->  00:05:06.696
the entire container, where the background-image is applied.
117

117

00:05:06.696  -->  00:05:08.828
And, that's what 100% does.
118

118

00:05:08.828  -->  00:05:11.087
So, also 100% of the width.
119

119

00:05:11.087  -->  00:05:13.070
Okay, now just for testing purposes,
120

120

00:05:13.070  -->  00:05:15.344
so that we can actually see what's going on here,
121

121

00:05:15.344  -->  00:05:19.783
let's add a height to this entire box, let's say 50rem.
122

122

00:05:19.783  -->  00:05:22.380
Okay, but again this is just for testing purposes.
123

123

00:05:22.380  -->  00:05:24.922
Later on, we want the content of the box, of course
124

124

00:05:24.922  -->  00:05:26.751
to define it's height.
125

125

00:05:26.751  -->  00:05:29.751
Okay, but just to take a look at it.
126

126

00:05:31.145  -->  00:05:33.435
And, nice, so here we go. Okay?
127

127

00:05:33.435  -->  00:05:35.467
Now, let's add some rounded corners here
128

128

00:05:35.467  -->  00:05:40.105
and also a box-shadow, like we have on the original version.
129

129

00:05:40.105  -->  00:05:43.733
So, border-radius once again three pixels.
130

130

00:05:43.733  -->  00:05:45.535
I think that's the one we've been using.
131

131

00:05:45.535  -->  00:05:47.208
And, that's actually also a good candidate
132

132

00:05:47.208  -->  00:05:49.058
for defining a variable. Okay?
133

133

00:05:49.058  -->  00:05:50.744
Because, now I'm not really sure if we've been using
134

134

00:05:50.744  -->  00:05:53.570
two pixels or three pixels, and so if we had a variable
135

135

00:05:53.570  -->  00:05:54.646
that would solve it.
136

136

00:05:54.646  -->  00:05:56.780
So, I encourage you to actually go ahead and do that.
137

137

00:05:56.780  -->  00:06:00.959
I'm not going to waste more time with that here. Okay?
138

138

00:06:00.959  -->  00:06:03.963
But you should totally do it.
139

139

00:06:03.963  -->  00:06:06.296
So, box-shadow again.
140

140

00:06:06.296  -->  00:06:09.169
(keyboard clicks)
141

141

00:06:09.169  -->  00:06:12.002
(keyboard clicks)
142

142

00:06:12.002  -->  00:06:14.859
(keyboard clicks)
143

143

00:06:14.859  -->  00:06:16.613
And, a .15 this time.
144

144

00:06:16.613  -->  00:06:18.120
So, a bit darker than usually,
145

145

00:06:18.120  -->  00:06:21.981
because we have this colored background here,
146

146

00:06:21.981  -->  00:06:25.115
and well, actually it's not really showing up.
147

147

00:06:25.115  -->  00:06:27.609
Let's take a look at that.
148

148

00:06:27.609  -->  00:06:30.276
Okay, I'm missing here the unit.
149

149

00:06:31.289  -->  00:06:34.466
So, that's why it wasn't working.
150

150

00:06:34.466  -->  00:06:36.885
Alright. So, now we have some subtle shadow here
151

151

00:06:36.885  -->  00:06:39.994
and we can actually increase it to .2 or something.
152

152

00:06:39.994  -->  00:06:41.730
So, the background is already dark, and so
153

153

00:06:41.730  -->  00:06:45.055
we have to make the shadow a bit darker as well, obviously.
154

154

00:06:45.055  -->  00:06:49.655
And, now just to show you the 100% with the cover,
155

155

00:06:49.655  -->  00:06:52.571
let's decrease this and take a look at what's going on.
156

156

00:06:52.571  -->  00:06:54.654
And, you'll see so 99% and then you'll see
157

157

00:06:54.654  -->  00:06:57.785
that the image starts repeating here on this side. Okay?
158

158

00:06:57.785  -->  00:07:00.462
So, imagine we put 50%, and the entire width
159

159

00:07:00.462  -->  00:07:02.782
would be divided into two here.
160

160

00:07:02.782  -->  00:07:05.658
And, of course, since the aspect ratio stays the same,
161

161

00:07:05.658  -->  00:07:07.685
we also have some more blank space
162

162

00:07:07.685  -->  00:07:10.569
and so the image starts multiplying down here as well.
163

163

00:07:10.569  -->  00:07:14.463
So, if you put now 25, we would have a four-by-four grid,
164

164

00:07:14.463  -->  00:07:16.111
I believe. And, yup!
165

165

00:07:16.111  -->  00:07:18.487
So, if that's the style you're going to maybe,
166

166

00:07:18.487  -->  00:07:21.147
I don't know, you can do that.
167

167

00:07:21.147  -->  00:07:23.609
Even like something like 10%,
168

168

00:07:23.609  -->  00:07:26.790
or, of course, we could also go higher.
169

169

00:07:26.790  -->  00:07:28.723
So, imagine like 150.
170

170

00:07:28.723  -->  00:07:29.942
Right?
171

171

00:07:29.942  -->  00:07:31.846
(keyboard clicks)
172

172

00:07:31.846  -->  00:07:35.897
All right, but of course, we stay with 100%.
173

173

00:07:35.897  -->  00:07:38.960
Now, taking a look at what we have here.
174

174

00:07:38.960  -->  00:07:41.974
What we're missing here is this design here. Okay?
175

175

00:07:41.974  -->  00:07:44.678
Now, what we could do here, is to add another element
176

176

00:07:44.678  -->  00:07:47.973
and then on that element we would use clip-path again
177

177

00:07:47.973  -->  00:07:50.907
in order to make for this shape here. Right?
178

178

00:07:50.907  -->  00:07:52.747
But, we are going to do something different
179

179

00:07:52.747  -->  00:07:55.557
and that's what I like to call the solid-color gradient.
180

180

00:07:55.557  -->  00:07:56.642
And, what is that?
181

181

00:07:56.642  -->  00:07:59.786
Well, in fact, this is just another background-color
182

182

00:07:59.786  -->  00:08:01.553
that we have on top of the image.
183

183

00:08:01.553  -->  00:08:02.926
So, this is actually a gradient.
184

184

00:08:02.926  -->  00:08:05.039
So, it starts from this side here, it's wide
185

185

00:08:05.039  -->  00:08:07.621
all the way here and then here, all of a sudden
186

186

00:08:07.621  -->  00:08:10.755
we changed to a transparent color here. Okay?
187

187

00:08:10.755  -->  00:08:13.264
So, again, this is in fact really a gradient.
188

188

00:08:13.264  -->  00:08:15.752
Let me show you how we do that.
189

189

00:08:15.752  -->  00:08:17.934
And so, we're going to explore the gradient function here
190

190

00:08:17.934  -->  00:08:18.934
in a bit more detail.
191

191

00:08:18.934  -->  00:08:20.588
Because with gradients can do a lot of stuff,
192

192

00:08:20.588  -->  00:08:21.797
and that's why I wanted to show you
193

193

00:08:21.797  -->  00:08:23.655
this technique here, as well.
194

194

00:08:23.655  -->  00:08:25.575
So, you see that we always have different ways
195

195

00:08:25.575  -->  00:08:27.690
of achieving the same things.
196

196

00:08:27.690  -->  00:08:30.268
And, I'm doing that here in this course, in this project,
197

197

00:08:30.268  -->  00:08:33.966
so that I can show you as many things as possible. Okay?
198

198

00:08:33.966  -->  00:08:36.638
So, we want the gradient to be on top of the image
199

199

00:08:36.638  -->  00:08:39.115
and so we simply add another background-image here,
200

200

00:08:39.115  -->  00:08:42.388
separated by commas, where the image is the second one.
201

201

00:08:42.388  -->  00:08:43.761
Right?
202

202

00:08:43.761  -->  00:08:47.079
So, linear-gradient and let's start with two colors.
203

203

00:08:47.079  -->  00:08:50.588
So, rgba and so the first one is white. Right?
204

204

00:08:50.588  -->  00:08:55.243
So, color white, but it's slightly transparent.
205

205

00:08:55.243  -->  00:08:58.690
And, that's why I used this rgba here, of course.
206

206

00:08:58.690  -->  00:09:03.026
So, let's start with using some other color. Okay?
207

207

00:09:03.026  -->  00:09:06.219
And, once again I'm using orangered.
208

208

00:09:06.219  -->  00:09:08.852
So, this is a color that I really like.
209

209

00:09:08.852  -->  00:09:10.507
And this is where it would like,
210

210

00:09:10.507  -->  00:09:12.673
simply withouth doing anything else.
211

211

00:09:12.673  -->  00:09:14.970
Okay? So, from white to red.
212

212

00:09:14.970  -->  00:09:17.600
So, next we should specify the direction here. Okay?
213

213

00:09:17.600  -->  00:09:20.354
So, if using the too-right or too-right bottom here
214

214

00:09:20.354  -->  00:09:22.000
all the time. Okay?
215

215

00:09:22.000  -->  00:09:24.567
But, something else we can do, instead of doing that,
216

216

00:09:24.567  -->  00:09:26.589
is to specify an angle.
217

217

00:09:26.589  -->  00:09:30.980
So, if we say for example 90 degrees, then instead of
218

218

00:09:30.980  -->  00:09:34.286
going that direction it was going, it would be now rotated.
219

219

00:09:34.286  -->  00:09:37.555
And, so 90 degrees is specifically going in the x direction.
220

220

00:09:37.555  -->  00:09:39.941
So, the gradient is going from left to right.
221

221

00:09:39.941  -->  00:09:44.098
But, we can change that and put, for example, 105 degrees.
222

222

00:09:44.098  -->  00:09:46.605
Okay? Then it looks like this.
223

223

00:09:46.605  -->  00:09:48.710
But, for now, it looks pretty much the same,
224

224

00:09:48.710  -->  00:09:51.075
but you'll see why we do it this way. Okay?
225

225

00:09:51.075  -->  00:09:54.236
And now, comes the most important part of this technique.
226

226

00:09:54.236  -->  00:09:58.157
Because, in here, we can actually specify percentages.
227

227

00:09:58.157  -->  00:10:01.132
So, we can specify at different points of the gradient
228

228

00:10:01.132  -->  00:10:03.488
which color there should be.
229

229

00:10:03.488  -->  00:10:05.634
So, we can say that in the beginning, let's say
230

230

00:10:05.634  -->  00:10:08.865
at 0%, we want this color here to be.
231

231

00:10:08.865  -->  00:10:12.794
So, the black should be at 0%. Okay?
232

232

00:10:12.794  -->  00:10:14.643
Let me actually give different lines
233

233

00:10:14.643  -->  00:10:18.123
for these different arguments here. Okay?
234

234

00:10:18.123  -->  00:10:21.708
So, 105 degrees and then this color at 0%
235

235

00:10:21.708  -->  00:10:24.797
and then the orangered at the end.
236

236

00:10:24.797  -->  00:10:26.530
(keyboard clicking)
237

237

00:10:26.530  -->  00:10:30.280
So, 0%, then we can say that at 50%
238

238

00:10:31.217  -->  00:10:33.238
we want this orangered color.
239

239

00:10:33.238  -->  00:10:36.216
And so, this is what it's gonna look like.
240

240

00:10:36.216  -->  00:10:37.057
Okay?
241

241

00:10:37.057  -->  00:10:38.593
And so, what happens here.
242

242

00:10:38.593  -->  00:10:41.507
So, we said out of 50% we wanted to be orange
243

243

00:10:41.507  -->  00:10:44.626
and so here is 50%, and so here it's completely orange.
244

244

00:10:44.626  -->  00:10:47.355
It's now a gradient happens between the left side,
245

245

00:10:47.355  -->  00:10:51.522
which is where the 0% is and here where the 50% is. Okay?
246

246

00:10:52.606  -->  00:10:55.817
And, we can all go even further and say
247

247

00:10:55.817  -->  00:11:00.082
that at 50% we also want it to be white.
248

248

00:11:00.082  -->  00:11:02.398
(keyboard clicks)
249

249

00:11:02.398  -->  00:11:04.934
So, what's going to happen then?
250

250

00:11:04.934  -->  00:11:07.874
Well, that's it; that's what's going to happen.
251

251

00:11:07.874  -->  00:11:11.917
So, we say at zero we want white, we say at 50 we want white
252

252

00:11:11.917  -->  00:11:14.082
and then at 50, which is right here the next step
253

253

00:11:14.082  -->  00:11:15.270
we want orange.
254

254

00:11:15.270  -->  00:11:17.311
And then, that is what happens.
255

255

00:11:17.311  -->  00:11:19.719
But, experiment with some more values here.
256

256

00:11:19.719  -->  00:11:21.995
For example, we could say...
257

257

00:11:21.995  -->  00:11:23.328
Where is it now?
258

258

00:11:25.956  -->  00:11:28.427
We could say here instead of 50, like 40. Okay?
259

259

00:11:28.427  -->  00:11:31.766
And then, it would be white at 0, white at 40
260

260

00:11:31.766  -->  00:11:33.210
and orange approximately here.
261

261

00:11:33.210  -->  00:11:35.098
So, then the gradient would happen
262

262

00:11:35.098  -->  00:11:38.321
between the 50 and the 40. Okay?
263

263

00:11:38.321  -->  00:11:41.073
But, if we put these two values at the same number,
264

264

00:11:41.073  -->  00:11:44.518
then what happens is that we have this, solid line here.
265

265

00:11:44.518  -->  00:11:45.906
And, so we have physically a gradient
266

266

00:11:45.906  -->  00:11:48.021
between two solid colors.
267

267

00:11:48.021  -->  00:11:49.272
And, that's why I like to call this
268

268

00:11:49.272  -->  00:11:51.291
the solid-color gradient.
269

269

00:11:51.291  -->  00:11:53.830
Now, in order to make it look like our original version,
270

270

00:11:53.830  -->  00:11:57.073
all we have to do is to replace this color here, orangred,
271

271

00:11:57.073  -->  00:12:00.081
by another color which is transparent.
272

272

00:12:00.081  -->  00:12:02.073
(keyboard clicking)
273

273

00:12:02.073  -->  00:12:05.262
So, transparent, that's also a valid CSS color
274

274

00:12:05.262  -->  00:12:08.378
and it's simply the absence of any color. Okay?
275

275

00:12:08.378  -->  00:12:10.240
And, so we can use that to our advantage
276

276

00:12:10.240  -->  00:12:11.825
in this technique here. Okay?
277

277

00:12:11.825  -->  00:12:13.125
So, transparent.
278

278

00:12:13.125  -->  00:12:14.744
(keyboard clicks)
279

279

00:12:14.744  -->  00:12:17.253
Replace it here transparent, and that's it.
280

280

00:12:17.253  -->  00:12:19.817
So, with this simple trick, we just created
281

281

00:12:19.817  -->  00:12:21.381
this awesome effect here.
282

282

00:12:21.381  -->  00:12:23.446
And, it was really simple, no clip-path
283

283

00:12:23.446  -->  00:12:25.232
or anything like that.
284

284

00:12:25.232  -->  00:12:27.388
Now, this isn't, of course, always possible to do
285

285

00:12:27.388  -->  00:12:30.749
so, for example, in here, where we had this.
286

286

00:12:30.749  -->  00:12:33.930
And, here we have this wedge cutting out.
287

287

00:12:33.930  -->  00:12:37.774
Well, in here, we really had to use clip-path.
288

288

00:12:37.774  -->  00:12:40.786
And, so different tools for different situations.
289

289

00:12:40.786  -->  00:12:43.552
Alright. So, let's now start with our form, actually.
290

290

00:12:43.552  -->  00:12:46.385
(keyboard clicks)
291

291

00:12:46.385  -->  00:12:48.994
And, well before that, we actually need a container
292

292

00:12:48.994  -->  00:12:50.499
where this form can be.
293

293

00:12:50.499  -->  00:12:53.666
And so, let's call that one book_form.
294

294

00:12:54.855  -->  00:12:56.145
So, book_form.
295

295

00:12:56.145  -->  00:12:58.978
So, book_form will basically, simply be a container
296

296

00:12:58.978  -->  00:13:02.157
sitting on the left side of this box. Okay?
297

297

00:13:02.157  -->  00:13:04.657
So, basically sitting in here,
298

298

00:13:06.104  -->  00:13:08.689
so that in there we can then put our form.
299

299

00:13:08.689  -->  00:13:11.468
And so that, again, is unique to this page.
300

300

00:13:11.468  -->  00:13:14.276
So, let's put it again here.
301

301

00:13:14.276  -->  00:13:15.964
(keyboard clicks)
302

302

00:13:15.964  -->  00:13:19.258
And, that's also why I gave it the element name here.
303

303

00:13:19.258  -->  00:13:21.771
So, block element, so book is the block
304

304

00:13:21.771  -->  00:13:24.474
and now the form is the element.
305

305

00:13:24.474  -->  00:13:27.766
And so, let's say I wanted the width to be 50%,
306

306

00:13:27.766  -->  00:13:30.773
so, basically, to occupy half of this entire box.
307

307

00:13:30.773  -->  00:13:34.588
And, then let's give it some padding as well.
308

308

00:13:34.588  -->  00:13:36.799
Let's say 6rem. Alright?
309

309

00:13:36.799  -->  00:13:41.196
And so, now we're ready to start our form component. Okay?
310

310

00:13:41.196  -->  00:13:43.211
So, let's go back here.
311

311

00:13:43.211  -->  00:13:45.625
And, then in here we will have, finally, our form.
312

312

00:13:45.625  -->  00:13:49.273
And, the form will also be an HTML form element, of course.
313

313

00:13:49.273  -->  00:13:51.091
So, when we have a form, we should always use
314

314

00:13:51.091  -->  00:13:53.059
the form element.
315

315

00:13:53.059  -->  00:13:56.290
So, form, and I'm also giving it the class of form.
316

316

00:13:56.290  -->  00:13:58.978
Now, the action is specifically the script
317

317

00:13:58.978  -->  00:14:01.401
or the file, where we want the form to go
318

318

00:14:01.401  -->  00:14:03.069
as soon as we hit the submit button.
319

319

00:14:03.069  -->  00:14:05.110
Now this form is not going to do anything.
320

320

00:14:05.110  -->  00:14:07.183
We just wanna style it, and we're not
321

321

00:14:07.183  -->  00:14:08.812
gonna give it any functionality.
322

322

00:14:08.812  -->  00:14:12.145
That's how we just make it go to like nothing here. Okay?
323

323

00:14:12.145  -->  00:14:13.426
So, form.
324

324

00:14:13.426  -->  00:14:16.168
Now, in here we're gonna have several groups,
325

325

00:14:16.168  -->  00:14:17.265
let's call them.
326

326

00:14:17.265  -->  00:14:19.955
So, one group for each of these; let me show you.
327

327

00:14:19.955  -->  00:14:23.744
So, one group is for this field and the label,
328

328

00:14:23.744  -->  00:14:25.752
because there actually is a label, so down here
329

329

00:14:25.752  -->  00:14:27.062
you can see the label.
330

330

00:14:27.062  -->  00:14:29.389
So, we're gonna implement that text jumping down there.
331

331

00:14:29.389  -->  00:14:30.658
Okay?
332

332

00:14:30.658  -->  00:14:32.498
And, here also is a label, which is invisible
333

333

00:14:32.498  -->  00:14:34.381
so, yeah, no, you'll see it.
334

334

00:14:34.381  -->  00:14:36.006
(keyboard clicking)
335

335

00:14:36.006  -->  00:14:38.399
So, each of these will be a different div element,
336

336

00:14:38.399  -->  00:14:40.564
so, that we can then, give it some space
337

337

00:14:40.564  -->  00:14:42.629
between the next element.
338

338

00:14:42.629  -->  00:14:44.275
So, form_group.
339

339

00:14:44.275  -->  00:14:46.652
(keyboard clicks)
340

340

00:14:46.652  -->  00:14:49.254
And, actually, this here is misspelled.
341

341

00:14:49.254  -->  00:14:50.087
So, form.
342

342

00:14:51.861  -->  00:14:55.564
And then, in each of these, we have an input and a label.
343

343

00:14:55.564  -->  00:14:57.092
And, I'm sure you're already familiar
344

344

00:14:57.092  -->  00:14:58.986
with these HTML elements.
345

345

00:14:58.986  -->  00:15:01.986
So, input with the class form_input.
346

346

00:15:04.928  -->  00:15:07.785
And, the type here that we want is text, in this case.
347

347

00:15:07.785  -->  00:15:11.960
We also want it to have a placeholder, saying Full Name.
348

348

00:15:11.960  -->  00:15:13.359
(keyboard clicks)
349

349

00:15:13.359  -->  00:15:16.054
And then, we want it to be required.
350

350

00:15:16.054  -->  00:15:18.034
So, we can put this little attribute here,
351

351

00:15:18.034  -->  00:15:19.477
calling it required.
352

352

00:15:19.477  -->  00:15:22.073
And then, the browser will not allow us to submit the form,
353

353

00:15:22.073  -->  00:15:25.450
unless this field here is actually filled out. Okay?
354

354

00:15:25.450  -->  00:15:27.746
So, that's what the required does.
355

355

00:15:27.746  -->  00:15:29.495
And now, the label.
356

356

00:15:29.495  -->  00:15:33.862
So, label, and I'm gonna call it form_label.
357

357

00:15:33.862  -->  00:15:35.803
So, pretty straightforward here.
358

358

00:15:35.803  -->  00:15:37.833
Now, as for the for attribute here.
359

359

00:15:37.833  -->  00:15:39.144
I'm not sure if you know how it works.
360

360

00:15:39.144  -->  00:15:43.280
Well, all we have to do, is to specify an id and input here
361

361

00:15:43.280  -->  00:15:45.911
which we want to link to that label.
362

362

00:15:45.911  -->  00:15:47.777
So, we add an id here.
363

363

00:15:47.777  -->  00:15:50.162
(keyboard clicks)
364

364

00:15:50.162  -->  00:15:53.346
And, I'm simply going with name. Okay?
365

365

00:15:53.346  -->  00:15:56.048
And, so now, when I put this id in here,
366

366

00:15:56.048  -->  00:15:58.281
then the label and the input will be connected.
367

367

00:15:58.281  -->  00:16:01.269
So, let me actually show you that.
368

368

00:16:01.269  -->  00:16:02.641
So, here is the input.
369

369

00:16:02.641  -->  00:16:06.987
And, well actually, of course I have to put something here.
370

370

00:16:06.987  -->  00:16:11.940
So, full name is the text that we want to display.
371

371

00:16:11.940  -->  00:16:13.340
And so, let's see it.
372

372

00:16:13.340  -->  00:16:14.843
And so now, if I click on this label,
373

373

00:16:14.843  -->  00:16:16.408
which is connected to this input,
374

374

00:16:16.408  -->  00:16:20.398
the input will be focused, like this. Okay?
375

375

00:16:20.398  -->  00:16:23.141
So, again, I click and then this will be focused.
376

376

00:16:23.141  -->  00:16:25.386
And so, they are not connected.
377

377

00:16:25.386  -->  00:16:27.053
Great. So, one group
378

378

00:16:28.452  -->  00:16:29.668
and the next group
379

379

00:16:29.668  -->  00:16:32.308
will be for the Email address.
380

380

00:16:32.308  -->  00:16:36.276
And so, there is actually a type in HTML5 which is Email,
381

381

00:16:36.276  -->  00:16:38.858
and then the browser will automatically figure out
382

382

00:16:38.858  -->  00:16:43.772
if we're writing in a valid Email address, or not. Okay?
383

383

00:16:43.772  -->  00:16:45.272
So, Email address.
384

384

00:16:46.837  -->  00:16:51.098
Again, we want this to be required and the name
385

385

00:16:51.098  -->  00:16:54.400
will be replaced with Email, of course, in both places;
386

386

00:16:54.400  -->  00:16:57.730
Email and Email, at the same time. Okay?
387

387

00:16:57.730  -->  00:16:59.477
And now, just one thing that we're missing,
388

388

00:16:59.477  -->  00:17:03.824
is that we actually have this h3 element here. Okay?
389

389

00:17:03.824  -->  00:17:06.022
So, let's put that in there.
390

390

00:17:06.022  -->  00:17:09.593
And, I will start copying it from the other section here.
391

391

00:17:09.593  -->  00:17:10.926
So, where is it?
392

392

00:17:13.882  -->  00:17:16.715
Yup. So here, let's copy this one.
393

393

00:17:19.880  -->  00:17:22.089
And, put it here in our form.
394

394

00:17:22.089  -->  00:17:23.548
So, right here.
395

395

00:17:23.548  -->  00:17:26.369
(keyboard clicks)
396

396

00:17:26.369  -->  00:17:28.991
Alright. So, Start booking now.
397

397

00:17:28.991  -->  00:17:31.841
(keyboard clicks)
398

398

00:17:31.841  -->  00:17:34.674
(keyboard clicks)
399

399

00:17:34.674  -->  00:17:37.507
(keyboard clicks)
400

400

00:17:39.595  -->  00:17:43.150
Okay? Maybe, that's actually a bit too much space here.
401

401

00:17:43.150  -->  00:17:45.813
And, we also don't want it to be centered here. Okay?
402

402

00:17:45.813  -->  00:17:48.576
And so, now it's very easy to do that.
403

403

00:17:48.576  -->  00:17:52.242
All we have to do, is just remove this class.
404

404

00:17:52.242  -->  00:17:54.808
And so, that's gone. Okay?
405

405

00:17:54.808  -->  00:17:57.719
Now, maybe we don't want something that big here.
406

406

00:17:57.719  -->  00:18:00.490
So, we can go with margin-bottom medium. Okay?
407

407

00:18:00.490  -->  00:18:01.912
So, we already have a class for that.
408

408

00:18:01.912  -->  00:18:03.326
Let's reuse it.
409

409

00:18:03.326  -->  00:18:04.882
(keyboard clicks)
410

410

00:18:04.882  -->  00:18:06.250
Okay.
411

411

00:18:06.250  -->  00:18:08.121
So, with all that in place, we are now ready
412

412

00:18:08.121  -->  00:18:11.762
to actually style these elements here. Okay?
413

413

00:18:11.762  -->  00:18:15.262
And so, let's do that in the next lecture.
