00:00:02.101  -->  00:00:03.536
<v Instructor>We're almost done with this section</v>
2

2

00:00:03.536  -->  00:00:06.839
and you have made amazing progress in this one.
3

3

00:00:06.839  -->  00:00:08.376
Congratulations.
4

4

00:00:08.376  -->  00:00:12.181
Now just to finish, let me show you an amazing NPM package
5

5

00:00:12.181  -->  00:00:14.686
that automatically reloads on a complete project
6

6

00:00:14.686  -->  00:00:18.909
as soon as we change any file in the project folder.
7

7

00:00:18.909  -->  00:00:22.919
It's really amazing and really easy to set up, you'll see.
8

8

00:00:22.919  -->  00:00:24.702
In the NPM package that I made,
9

9

00:00:24.702  -->  00:00:26.678
is simply called live server.
10

10

00:00:26.678  -->  00:00:30.845
So all we have to do is to type "NPM install live server."
11

11

00:00:33.167  -->  00:00:35.654
Now in the last lecture or the lecture before that,
12

12

00:00:35.654  -->  00:00:38.648
when we fist installed our first packages,
13

13

00:00:38.648  -->  00:00:41.991
we always installed them either by specifying the save def
14

14

00:00:41.991  -->  00:00:44.222
or the save options, right?
15

15

00:00:44.222  -->  00:00:45.508
Remember that?
16

16

00:00:45.508  -->  00:00:49.188
We use save def on node-sass to specify it as a
17

17

00:00:49.188  -->  00:00:51.771
development dependency and we simply used save
18

18

00:00:51.771  -->  00:00:55.591
on day query to specify it as a normal dependency.
19

19

00:00:55.591  -->  00:00:58.471
What that did, was to basically install these packages
20

20

00:00:58.471  -->  00:01:02.693
locally and denote modules folder, right?
21

21

00:01:02.693  -->  00:01:03.873
Sorry.
22

22

00:01:03.873  -->  00:01:06.518
Remember this folder here, right?
23

23

00:01:06.518  -->  00:01:09.572
We installed them locally in this project.
24

24

00:01:09.572  -->  00:01:11.976
Now what we want to do with this package
25

25

00:01:11.976  -->  00:01:13.833
is a little bit different though.
26

26

00:01:13.833  -->  00:01:16.364
We want to install this one globally, because we want
27

27

00:01:16.364  -->  00:01:19.882
to be able to use it, not only in this particular project,
28

28

00:01:19.882  -->  00:01:22.502
but also on all future projects
29

29

00:01:22.502  -->  00:01:24.665
and anywhere on our computer.
30

30

00:01:24.665  -->  00:01:28.872
At NPM, that is called a global installation, okay?
31

31

00:01:28.872  -->  00:01:31.302
We want to install life server globally,
32

32

00:01:31.302  -->  00:01:33.823
not in this particular project, but basically,
33

33

00:01:33.823  -->  00:01:36.801
we want to install it on our computer.
34

34

00:01:36.801  -->  00:01:40.508
Instead of using save or save def, we use "g"
35

35

00:01:40.508  -->  00:01:41.969
which means global.
36

36

00:01:41.969  -->  00:01:43.715
All we have to do is to install it
37

37

00:01:43.715  -->  00:01:46.048
just like any other package.
38

38

00:01:47.772  -->  00:01:50.710
Alright, and now, NPM actually ran into some error,
39

39

00:01:50.710  -->  00:01:53.956
but I'm sure it's because of some permission stuff.
40

40

00:01:53.956  -->  00:01:56.654
This usually doesn't occur on Windows but here on a Mac,
41

41

00:01:56.654  -->  00:01:58.468
it actually happens all the time.
42

42

00:01:58.468  -->  00:02:02.018
But the easy fix for that is to simply write "sudo"
43

43

00:02:02.018  -->  00:02:04.445
in front of our command and then it will simply ask me
44

44

00:02:04.445  -->  00:02:07.969
for the password and then everything should work just fine.
45

45

00:02:07.969  -->  00:02:10.201
Let's try it again now with sudo.
46

46

00:02:10.201  -->  00:02:12.170
Now, if this didn't happen on your machine,
47

47

00:02:12.170  -->  00:02:14.105
then everything's fine, you don't have to do this.
48

48

00:02:14.105  -->  00:02:18.012
It's only if you also run into the same kind of error.
49

49

00:02:18.012  -->  00:02:22.179
NPM install life server g, so as a global package.
50

50

00:02:25.685  -->  00:02:30.276
Now it asks for my password and so here we go.
51

51

00:02:30.276  -->  00:02:32.675
Let's see if it works this time.
52

52

00:02:32.675  -->  00:02:34.630
And yeah, so now it works.
53

53

00:02:34.630  -->  00:02:36.035
Now you will see that it's not
54

54

00:02:36.035  -->  00:02:38.789
in the dependencies here, alright?
55

55

00:02:38.789  -->  00:02:40.848
You will also see that it's probably not
56

56

00:02:40.848  -->  00:02:43.219
in the note modules file.
57

57

00:02:43.219  -->  00:02:46.219
G...I...L... and it's called "life."
58

58

00:02:48.915  -->  00:02:50.145
and it's not here, okay.
59

59

00:02:50.145  -->  00:02:52.797
That's exactly what we expected, right?
60

60

00:02:52.797  -->  00:02:56.964
Because we installed this one as a global package.
61

61

00:02:57.994  -->  00:03:00.393
Since it's a global package, we can actually call it
62

62

00:03:00.393  -->  00:03:02.976
directly from the command line.
63

63

00:03:04.691  -->  00:03:06.543
Let me just clear this up.
64

64

00:03:06.543  -->  00:03:09.338
And I also have to go back to my project folder.
65

65

00:03:09.338  -->  00:03:11.585
You see, right now I'm in the sass folder,
66

66

00:03:11.585  -->  00:03:15.002
and I need to go back to the main folder.
67

67

00:03:16.745  -->  00:03:18.570
Now I'm here, right?
68

68

00:03:18.570  -->  00:03:20.739
Alright, and now, all I have to do is when I'm
69

69

00:03:20.739  -->  00:03:24.489
in my home folder, is to write "live server."
70

70

00:03:25.959  -->  00:03:29.344
Again, I can call this on the command line,
71

71

00:03:29.344  -->  00:03:30.792
because it's a global package.
72

72

00:03:30.792  -->  00:03:33.206
Let's see what happens now.
73

73

00:03:33.206  -->  00:03:34.949
And here we go, like magic,
74

74

00:03:34.949  -->  00:03:37.248
it opened the Google Chrome browser
75

75

00:03:37.248  -->  00:03:41.191
because it's my default browser and it opened the project.
76

76

00:03:41.191  -->  00:03:43.250
That's amazing, right?
77

77

00:03:43.250  -->  00:03:46.402
You actually see that it's now in its local host,
78

78

00:03:46.402  -->  00:03:49.735
so this 172001 is actually a local host,
79

79

00:03:50.589  -->  00:03:54.796
and then this one here is the port, so it's on port 8080.
80

80

00:03:54.796  -->  00:03:56.311
You could actually change this one here
81

81

00:03:56.311  -->  00:03:58.552
in the definitions supply server, but for now,
82

82

00:03:58.552  -->  00:04:00.232
we don't want to do any of that.
83

83

00:04:00.232  -->  00:04:02.837
All we want is for this to work and we're not worried
84

84

00:04:02.837  -->  00:04:05.485
about this port number here at all.
85

85

00:04:05.485  -->  00:04:06.631
It's doesn't matter.
86

86

00:04:06.631  -->  00:04:09.468
And so now, this is actually a real http server.
87

87

00:04:09.468  -->  00:04:10.740
I was saying, right in the beginning,
88

88

00:04:10.740  -->  00:04:13.407
as we first opened this page here,
89

89

00:04:13.407  -->  00:04:16.365
that we were later going to do it on a real htp server,
90

90

00:04:16.365  -->  00:04:17.431
and that's what we're doing here.
91

91

00:04:17.431  -->  00:04:21.618
Now it's not longer defiled protocol, as we have here,
92

92

00:04:21.618  -->  00:04:24.653
but it's not a htp protocol.
93

93

00:04:24.653  -->  00:04:27.642
Okay, now let's actually change something.
94

94

00:04:27.642  -->  00:04:30.105
Just like before, with the sass code here,
95

95

00:04:30.105  -->  00:04:31.982
you have to keep this one running here as well.
96

96

00:04:31.982  -->  00:04:34.039
Now it says "ready for changes."
97

97

00:04:34.039  -->  00:04:35.701
You have to keep this one running.
98

98

00:04:35.701  -->  00:04:38.218
Again, if you now want to type some more code,
99

99

00:04:38.218  -->  00:04:42.410
you have to open even another tab by hitting command-T.
100

100

00:04:42.410  -->  00:04:44.741
And in Windows, you have to open another window.
101

101

00:04:44.741  -->  00:04:47.074
Now we have actually two things here running
102

102

00:04:47.074  -->  00:04:49.847
in the background so it keeps compiling our sass file,
103

103

00:04:49.847  -->  00:04:52.458
and it keeps waiting for changes, and then reloading
104

104

00:04:52.458  -->  00:04:55.556
that page as soon as it detects a change.
105

105

00:04:55.556  -->  00:04:59.556
Let's not change something here, and this one here,
106

106

00:04:59.556  -->  00:05:03.723
for example, let's change the color white simply to red.
107

107

00:05:05.098  -->  00:05:08.848
We save it and now we see that for over here,
108

108

00:05:11.459  -->  00:05:12.459
it did this.
109

109

00:05:13.359  -->  00:05:16.557
The rendering complete and then here, change detected.
110

110

00:05:16.557  -->  00:05:18.002
Let's see what happening.
111

111

00:05:18.002  -->  00:05:19.420
Whoa, and here it is!
112

112

00:05:19.420  -->  00:05:21.982
So what was white before is now red,
113

113

00:05:21.982  -->  00:05:24.469
and we didn't have to click the reload button.
114

114

00:05:24.469  -->  00:05:28.456
All we had to do was to change the code and come here
115

115

00:05:28.456  -->  00:05:30.759
and everything updated for us very nicely.
116

116

00:05:30.759  -->  00:05:32.662
You also saw the power of this change in the code
117

117

00:05:32.662  -->  00:05:35.735
in one simple place, and a lot of stuff happens
118

118

00:05:35.735  -->  00:05:36.802
in the background.
119

119

00:05:36.802  -->  00:05:40.478
So I change it back to white and when I go here, it's white.
120

120

00:05:40.478  -->  00:05:42.165
No need to reload.
121

121

00:05:42.165  -->  00:05:44.978
And that's actually all I had to show you for this lecture.
122

122

00:05:44.978  -->  00:05:47.812
We now have our development environment nicely set up.
123

123

00:05:47.812  -->  00:05:50.085
We can maybe later add some stuff to it,
124

124

00:05:50.085  -->  00:05:52.773
like the compression or the prefixing stuff
125

125

00:05:52.773  -->  00:05:55.345
that I was telling you about in the previous lecture,
126

126

00:05:55.345  -->  00:05:58.080
I think, but for now, everything is working just fine
127

127

00:05:58.080  -->  00:06:00.238
and we're ready to move on to the next section
128

128

00:06:00.238  -->  00:06:02.789
and really start working on a project
129

129

00:06:02.789  -->  00:06:07.085
and to build all these exciting section that I have for you
130

130

00:06:07.085  -->  00:06:08.920
here in this webpage.
131

131

00:06:08.920  -->  00:06:10.786
The next section, that's what we're going to do.
132

132

00:06:10.786  -->  00:06:12.963
We're going to build all of this.
133

133

00:06:12.963  -->  00:06:15.383
I hope you're excited for that and I can't wait
134

134

00:06:15.383  -->  00:06:17.800
to see you in the next video.
