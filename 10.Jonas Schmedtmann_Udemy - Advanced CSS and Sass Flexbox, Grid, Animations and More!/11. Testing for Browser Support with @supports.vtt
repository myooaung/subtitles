00:00:01.339  -->  00:00:03.548
<v Instructor>In a course about super modern CSS</v>
2

2

00:00:03.548  -->  00:00:07.332
of course there has to be a lecture about browser support.
3

3

00:00:07.332  -->  00:00:08.886
And so here it is.
4

4

00:00:08.886  -->  00:00:11.386
So why is this even important?
5

5

00:00:12.225  -->  00:00:14.613
Well I'm not going to tell you why browser support
6

6

00:00:14.613  -->  00:00:18.948
is so I'm because you already know the reasons for that.
7

7

00:00:18.948  -->  00:00:21.607
What I should tell you though over and over again
8

8

00:00:21.607  -->  00:00:25.402
is that many of the new and modern CSS features
9

9

00:00:25.402  -->  00:00:29.295
I showed you in this course, are highly experimental.
10

10

00:00:29.295  -->  00:00:33.156
And right now they only work in the top modern browsers.
11

11

00:00:33.156  -->  00:00:35.388
So this is important to keep in mind.
12

12

00:00:35.388  -->  00:00:37.707
Now if you don't need to support older browsers
13

13

00:00:37.707  -->  00:00:39.212
then that's perfect.
14

14

00:00:39.212  -->  00:00:41.237
You don't need to worry about this.
15

15

00:00:41.237  -->  00:00:43.813
But if you want to at least support some older browsers
16

16

00:00:43.813  -->  00:00:47.301
then you should always start by checking a very handy too
17

17

00:00:47.301  -->  00:00:51.468
called caniuse.com before using a property in production.
18

18

00:00:52.621  -->  00:00:54.660
Now, and here comes the cool part.
19

19

00:00:54.660  -->  00:00:57.601
Even if a browser doesn't support a property
20

20

00:00:57.601  -->  00:00:59.552
that you really wanna use on a site,
21

21

00:00:59.552  -->  00:01:02.338
then we can still apply it to the modern browsers and show
22

22

00:01:02.338  -->  00:01:05.805
a different, more simple style on the older browsers.
23

23

00:01:05.805  -->  00:01:09.566
And that's a concept called graceful degradation.
24

24

00:01:09.566  -->  00:01:12.554
So providing a top notch experience for modern browsers
25

25

00:01:12.554  -->  00:01:16.153
and providing an adapted reduced version to browsers
26

26

00:01:16.153  -->  00:01:19.813
that don't understand all of these shiny new features.
27

27

00:01:19.813  -->  00:01:21.581
And how do we do that?
28

28

00:01:21.581  -->  00:01:24.014
Well that's exactly what I'm gonna teach you
29

29

00:01:24.014  -->  00:01:25.927
in this lecture.
30

30

00:01:25.927  -->  00:01:29.655
So you're gonna learn how to use feature queries in CSS
31

31

00:01:29.655  -->  00:01:32.080
using the support's @ rule.
32

32

00:01:32.080  -->  00:01:34.282
And with that you can use the principle of
33

33

00:01:34.282  -->  00:01:37.073
graceful degragdation on selected properties
34

34

00:01:37.073  -->  00:01:38.535
on your website.
35

35

00:01:38.535  -->  00:01:41.689
Plus I'm also gonna teach you yet another brand new
36

36

00:01:41.689  -->  00:01:44.653
CSS property called backdrop filter.
37

37

00:01:44.653  -->  00:01:46.403
So let's get to work.
38

38

00:01:47.680  -->  00:01:51.113
So this is how we left the website after the last lecture.
39

39

00:01:51.113  -->  00:01:53.334
And you see that we still have this orange color here
40

40

00:01:53.334  -->  00:01:55.691
going on and that's because we forgot to remove it
41

41

00:01:55.691  -->  00:01:58.785
for our testing purposes in the media queries, right?
42

42

00:01:58.785  -->  00:02:01.310
But for now let's leave it at that.
43

43

00:02:01.310  -->  00:02:03.495
And the first thing that I wanna do is to show you
44

44

00:02:03.495  -->  00:02:05.358
that new property that I just mentioned
45

45

00:02:05.358  -->  00:02:07.380
called backdrop filter.
46

46

00:02:07.380  -->  00:02:10.700
So let me show you where I want to do that.
47

47

00:02:10.700  -->  00:02:12.707
And it's here in the popup.
48

48

00:02:12.707  -->  00:02:16.331
So now what backdrop filter does is to apply a filter
49

49

00:02:16.331  -->  00:02:19.335
to what's behind the selected element.
50

50

00:02:19.335  -->  00:02:21.926
And so what I wanna do here is to add a backdrop filter
51

51

00:02:21.926  -->  00:02:25.412
to this background here with a blur.
52

52

00:02:25.412  -->  00:02:27.056
So basically blurring the background
53

53

00:02:27.056  -->  00:02:30.457
instead of making it dark as we have it here.
54

54

00:02:30.457  -->  00:02:32.397
Now the thing is that backdrop filter doesn't
55

55

00:02:32.397  -->  00:02:34.473
currently work on Google Chrome.
56

56

00:02:34.473  -->  00:02:37.980
So let me show that to you actually.
57

57

00:02:37.980  -->  00:02:40.063
So let's open that popup.
58

58

00:02:41.422  -->  00:02:42.589
And right here
59

59

00:02:44.093  -->  00:02:46.010
adding backdrop filter.
60

60

00:02:50.692  -->  00:02:52.938
Blur and then ten pixel.
61

61

00:02:52.938  -->  00:02:55.182
So we have to apply a value here in order to say
62

62

00:02:55.182  -->  00:02:56.945
how much blur we actually want.
63

63

00:02:56.945  -->  00:02:58.920
And this one currently only works in Safari.
64

64

00:02:58.920  -->  00:03:01.169
And so as I mentioned, not in Chrome.
65

65

00:03:01.169  -->  00:03:04.302
And actually to work in Safari, it needs to have the
66

66

00:03:04.302  -->  00:03:06.969
webkit prefix so let's add that.
67

67

00:03:08.691  -->  00:03:11.079
But I'm still leaving the unprefixed version here
68

68

00:03:11.079  -->  00:03:14.260
because in the future it may work without the prefix.
69

69

00:03:14.260  -->  00:03:15.273
Okay?
70

70

00:03:15.273  -->  00:03:16.414
So let me show you that this is
71

71

00:03:16.414  -->  00:03:18.831
not working in Google Chrome.
72

72

00:03:19.789  -->  00:03:23.271
So we reloaded the page and it's not really working.
73

73

00:03:23.271  -->  00:03:27.043
But let me now show you the same thing in Safari.
74

74

00:03:27.043  -->  00:03:28.715
And if you're not on a Mac, you cannot really
75

75

00:03:28.715  -->  00:03:30.738
test this in Safari.
76

76

00:03:30.738  -->  00:03:32.581
You could only test it on a mobile Safari
77

77

00:03:32.581  -->  00:03:35.986
like on an iPad or an iPhone or something.
78

78

00:03:35.986  -->  00:03:38.454
But that's not really the point here anyway.
79

79

00:03:38.454  -->  00:03:40.275
Because what I just wanted to show you was how
80

80

00:03:40.275  -->  00:03:41.867
the @ support rule works.
81

81

00:03:41.867  -->  00:03:44.812
So how the feature query works, okay?
82

82

00:03:44.812  -->  00:03:47.007
So anyway, you see here now that the background
83

83

00:03:47.007  -->  00:03:48.973
is actually blurred, right?
84

84

00:03:48.973  -->  00:03:51.286
So we keep scrolling and everything you see here
85

85

00:03:51.286  -->  00:03:52.203
is blurred.
86

86

00:03:53.420  -->  00:03:55.441
And that's because that is exactly what is behind
87

87

00:03:55.441  -->  00:03:59.608
this element we selected and applied the backdrop filter.
88

88

00:04:01.318  -->  00:04:03.450
Now when we have this backdrop filter,
89

89

00:04:03.450  -->  00:04:05.788
we don't want this to be this dark.
90

90

00:04:05.788  -->  00:04:08.657
So this background shouldn't be so dark.
91

91

00:04:08.657  -->  00:04:12.824
So what we want then is the background to be much lighter.
92

92

00:04:14.460  -->  00:04:16.730
So let me copy that to this place here
93

93

00:04:16.730  -->  00:04:19.086
just for testing purposes.
94

94

00:04:19.086  -->  00:04:22.336
So let's say we want a .3 in that case.
95

95

00:04:24.186  -->  00:04:25.395
So looking like this.
96

96

00:04:25.395  -->  00:04:28.263
So that looks a lot better, right?
97

97

00:04:28.263  -->  00:04:30.685
So how do we then implement this functionality
98

98

00:04:30.685  -->  00:04:34.988
in Safari and leave it the way it was in Google Chrome?
99

99

00:04:34.988  -->  00:04:37.807
And that's where the feature query comes in.
100

100

00:04:37.807  -->  00:04:38.640
All right.
101

101

00:04:41.023  -->  00:04:42.947
So this is how it works.
102

102

00:04:42.947  -->  00:04:46.364
@supports
103

103

00:04:47.858  -->  00:04:49.931
and then in here we can make a test.
104

104

00:04:49.931  -->  00:04:52.434
So basically as the browser if it supports
105

105

00:04:52.434  -->  00:04:54.084
a certain property.
106

106

00:04:54.084  -->  00:04:57.036
So let's copy this one in here.
107

107

00:04:57.036  -->  00:04:58.830
So this entire thing actually,
108

108

00:04:58.830  -->  00:05:01.710
so we cannot just put webkit backdrop filter
109

109

00:05:01.710  -->  00:05:02.886
without this part here.
110

110

00:05:02.886  -->  00:05:06.205
So we always to specify the value as well.
111

111

00:05:06.205  -->  00:05:09.403
And just like in media queries, you can add some logic.
112

112

00:05:09.403  -->  00:05:12.486
And so I'm also gonna copy this part.
113

113

00:05:15.095  -->  00:05:16.689
Okay?
114

114

00:05:16.689  -->  00:05:18.831
And so if this one is supported or this one,
115

115

00:05:18.831  -->  00:05:22.154
which in fact is the same but since we have both versions,
116

116

00:05:22.154  -->  00:05:24.266
one with the prefix and one without,
117

117

00:05:24.266  -->  00:05:26.683
I'm just including both here.
118

118

00:05:28.372  -->  00:05:30.692
And now we can say what we want to happen
119

119

00:05:30.692  -->  00:05:33.545
if this property is supported.
120

120

00:05:33.545  -->  00:05:35.822
And what we want to happen is of course
121

121

00:05:35.822  -->  00:05:36.655
this part.
122

122

00:05:40.956  -->  00:05:42.110
And that's actually it.
123

123

00:05:42.110  -->  00:05:43.989
We just implemented graceful degradation
124

124

00:05:43.989  -->  00:05:46.289
using the support's @ rule.
125

125

00:05:46.289  -->  00:05:48.089
So a feature query.
126

126

00:05:48.089  -->  00:05:50.922
So let's check that out in Safari.
127

127

00:05:52.807  -->  00:05:54.386
And here we go.
128

128

00:05:54.386  -->  00:05:57.051
So well you see something else going wrong here
129

129

00:05:57.051  -->  00:05:59.634
but let's fix that in a second.
130

130

00:06:01.609  -->  00:06:03.936
For now what matters here is that it works,
131

131

00:06:03.936  -->  00:06:06.319
that the background is the light color
132

132

00:06:06.319  -->  00:06:10.022
and not the black color that we specified up here.
133

133

00:06:10.022  -->  00:06:14.141
So if we take a look at that in Google Chrome,
134

134

00:06:14.141  -->  00:06:15.891
so let's reload that.
135

135

00:06:16.785  -->  00:06:20.849
Then it will still be this dark color and not blurred
136

136

00:06:20.849  -->  00:06:23.389
because it's not working obviously.
137

137

00:06:23.389  -->  00:06:24.686
So perfect.
138

138

00:06:24.686  -->  00:06:27.023
That's exactly how the feature query works.
139

139

00:06:27.023  -->  00:06:29.429
If it's not supported then this code here
140

140

00:06:29.429  -->  00:06:31.040
is simply not applied.
141

141

00:06:31.040  -->  00:06:32.851
And if it is, then well of course,
142

142

00:06:32.851  -->  00:06:35.322
this code here gets applied.
143

143

00:06:35.322  -->  00:06:37.583
Now about this other issue that I was noticing here
144

144

00:06:37.583  -->  00:06:38.416
in Safari.
145

145

00:06:42.184  -->  00:06:43.709
That is probably because of the
146

146

00:06:43.709  -->  00:06:45.549
backface visibility property.
147

147

00:06:45.549  -->  00:06:49.638
So let's now actually take a look at the Can I Use
148

148

00:06:49.638  -->  00:06:54.029
that I showed you before and test it with that example.
149

149

00:06:54.029  -->  00:06:55.946
So backface visibility.
150

150

00:06:57.636  -->  00:07:00.335
And well backface visibility
151

151

00:07:00.335  -->  00:07:04.841
is actually a part of the CSS Transforms Module.
152

152

00:07:04.841  -->  00:07:07.432
But here we now have a lot of information.
153

153

00:07:07.432  -->  00:07:10.223
So let's take a look at Safari because that's the one
154

154

00:07:10.223  -->  00:07:12.442
where it wasn't really working.
155

155

00:07:12.442  -->  00:07:16.293
And so now here we see that Safari nine and ten
156

156

00:07:16.293  -->  00:07:19.161
are reported to still require a prefix for the related
157

157

00:07:19.161  -->  00:07:21.807
backface visibility property.
158

158

00:07:21.807  -->  00:07:23.857
And it actually shows down here as well.
159

159

00:07:23.857  -->  00:07:27.812
So this needs a prefix in order to work.
160

160

00:07:27.812  -->  00:07:29.312
So let's add that.
161

161

00:07:31.054  -->  00:07:32.054
So the card.
162

162

00:07:33.960  -->  00:07:35.709
And where do we have that?
163

163

00:07:35.709  -->  00:07:37.376
Backface visibility.
164

164

00:07:38.358  -->  00:07:41.168
It's probably somewhere more up there
165

165

00:07:41.168  -->  00:07:43.412
and yeah, here it is.
166

166

00:07:43.412  -->  00:07:44.682
That would be the one.
167

167

00:07:44.682  -->  00:07:47.374
And as always we put the prefix version
168

168

00:07:47.374  -->  00:07:49.707
before the original version.
169

169

00:07:51.806  -->  00:07:54.276
So webkit is for Safari and so let's now
170

170

00:07:54.276  -->  00:07:56.609
take a look again at Safari.
171

171

00:07:58.431  -->  00:08:00.467
And so here we go.
172

172

00:08:00.467  -->  00:08:02.241
Now it's working just fine.
173

173

00:08:02.241  -->  00:08:04.724
And still of course this white and blurred background
174

174

00:08:04.724  -->  00:08:06.923
which looks really cool.
175

175

00:08:06.923  -->  00:08:09.340
Now of course, backdrop filter can be other things.
176

176

00:08:09.340  -->  00:08:11.716
It doesn't have to be just the blur.
177

177

00:08:11.716  -->  00:08:13.560
So let's inspect this here.
178

178

00:08:13.560  -->  00:08:16.096
And inspect on Safari actually only works
179

179

00:08:16.096  -->  00:08:19.117
if you first enable that option.
180

180

00:08:19.117  -->  00:08:21.699
And I think that's in the definitions in case
181

181

00:08:21.699  -->  00:08:23.112
you're using a Mac.
182

182

00:08:23.112  -->  00:08:24.855
So you have to click here,
183

183

00:08:24.855  -->  00:08:26.913
show develop menu in the menu bar.
184

184

00:08:26.913  -->  00:08:30.056
Then it's gonna appear up there.
185

185

00:08:30.056  -->  00:08:32.889
And then you can make the inspect.
186

186

00:08:34.225  -->  00:08:36.485
So again right now it only works on Safari,
187

187

00:08:36.485  -->  00:08:39.625
but in the future, I'm sure it will come to Google Chrome
188

188

00:08:39.625  -->  00:08:41.407
as well and all the other browsers.
189

189

00:08:41.407  -->  00:08:43.558
And so even if you don't have Safari installed
190

190

00:08:43.558  -->  00:08:46.466
on your computer right now, it's still good to learn this
191

191

00:08:46.466  -->  00:08:47.914
even at this point.
192

192

00:08:47.914  -->  00:08:52.081
So we can add something else here like brightness.
193

193

00:08:53.093  -->  00:08:55.232
So remember we used filters before,
194

194

00:08:55.232  -->  00:08:58.378
but the difference was that the filter was applied
195

195

00:08:58.378  -->  00:09:00.683
to the element itself while in this case
196

196

00:09:00.683  -->  00:09:04.584
it's just applied to the element that's behind.
197

197

00:09:04.584  -->  00:09:08.011
So brightness for example let's say 200% here or something.
198

198

00:09:08.011  -->  00:09:10.971
And then the background will become really bright.
199

199

00:09:10.971  -->  00:09:13.563
You see it here in these colors.
200

200

00:09:13.563  -->  00:09:17.407
Or you can make it dark as well, like 20%.
201

201

00:09:17.407  -->  00:09:19.605
And then it becomes really dark.
202

202

00:09:19.605  -->  00:09:23.772
We can use something crazy like invert for example.
203

203

00:09:24.758  -->  00:09:26.828
And it will invert all the colors
204

204

00:09:26.828  -->  00:09:30.995
that is behind the element so it looks crazy like this.
205

205

00:09:32.653  -->  00:09:35.069
I don't know when that will ever be useful,
206

206

00:09:35.069  -->  00:09:36.765
but it still exists.
207

207

00:09:36.765  -->  00:09:38.101
So there's a lot of different values
208

208

00:09:38.101  -->  00:09:40.401
for the backdrop filter.
209

209

00:09:40.401  -->  00:09:43.086
So with sepia here it would look like this.
210

210

00:09:43.086  -->  00:09:44.969
So the sepia color is applied to the back
211

211

00:09:44.969  -->  00:09:47.795
and yeah if you wanna experiment more with this
212

212

00:09:47.795  -->  00:09:50.295
then feel free to do that now.
213

213

00:09:54.168  -->  00:09:57.626
So taking now a look at the rest of the webpage.
214

214

00:09:57.626  -->  00:09:59.649
I think that everything is working just fine here.
215

215

00:09:59.649  -->  00:10:02.823
I don't really have an older version of Safari to test,
216

216

00:10:02.823  -->  00:10:06.048
but at least in this version everything is going just fine.
217

217

00:10:06.048  -->  00:10:10.215
What I do have though is an older version of Firefox.
218

218

00:10:11.967  -->  00:10:13.884
And so let's open that.
219

219

00:10:15.954  -->  00:10:17.461
Firefox.
220

220

00:10:17.461  -->  00:10:19.618
And it actually says here, well in Portuguese,
221

221

00:10:19.618  -->  00:10:21.882
that there is a new version available, 55.
222

222

00:10:21.882  -->  00:10:24.063
But I don't want to do that right now
223

223

00:10:24.063  -->  00:10:27.822
because I actually want this older version.
224

224

00:10:27.822  -->  00:10:30.905
So let's copy the URL here to Safari.
225

225

00:10:35.536  -->  00:10:38.244
And again you'll see our orange version.
226

226

00:10:38.244  -->  00:10:41.009
And now actually in Safari, it wasn't orange.
227

227

00:10:41.009  -->  00:10:43.375
So something wrong was going on there.
228

228

00:10:43.375  -->  00:10:45.458
Let's open that up again.
229

229

00:10:47.987  -->  00:10:49.822
So you see that it's green here
230

230

00:10:49.822  -->  00:10:51.204
and that shouldn't be like that
231

231

00:10:51.204  -->  00:10:54.612
because in Safari it is orange which means
232

232

00:10:54.612  -->  00:10:56.489
that it's the large hero image.
233

233

00:10:56.489  -->  00:10:58.758
Remember from the last lecture.
234

234

00:10:58.758  -->  00:11:01.282
And then in Chrome it's also that,
235

235

00:11:01.282  -->  00:11:02.980
but in Safari right now, it's not.
236

236

00:11:02.980  -->  00:11:05.808
And that means that something wrong is going on here
237

237

00:11:05.808  -->  00:11:08.201
and so we should fix that.
238

238

00:11:08.201  -->  00:11:12.255
And the problem is actually in here, in this media query.
239

239

00:11:12.255  -->  00:11:15.887
So Safari doesn't support this part here.
240

240

00:11:15.887  -->  00:11:18.021
So that's something that I should have done
241

241

00:11:18.021  -->  00:11:20.395
in last lecture where we talked about responsive images
242

242

00:11:20.395  -->  00:11:23.006
in CSS, but I didn't really think of it
243

243

00:11:23.006  -->  00:11:25.140
and so I'm doing it now.
244

244

00:11:25.140  -->  00:11:26.506
So it's really important that we do this
245

245

00:11:26.506  -->  00:11:28.643
because otherwise this entire logic here
246

246

00:11:28.643  -->  00:11:30.107
is not going to work on Safari.
247

247

00:11:30.107  -->  00:11:33.274
Neither the desktop version nor the mobile version.
248

248

00:11:33.274  -->  00:11:34.623
Which is really important because most people
249

249

00:11:34.623  -->  00:11:38.703
use Safari on their iPhones or their iPads.
250

250

00:11:38.703  -->  00:11:41.705
So we have to add another line here.
251

251

00:11:41.705  -->  00:11:43.538
So just copy this one.
252

252

00:11:47.593  -->  00:11:49.426
Right back here again.
253

253

00:11:51.450  -->  00:11:52.456
All right.
254

254

00:11:52.456  -->  00:11:54.027
So that's the part here that doesn't work in Safari.
255

255

00:11:54.027  -->  00:11:57.035
But we have something that we can use instead of this
256

256

00:11:57.035  -->  00:12:00.385
and which does work in Safari and that is called
257

257

00:12:00.385  -->  00:12:04.552
webkit min device
258

258

00:12:06.750  -->  00:12:10.823
pixel ratio, should be two.
259

259

00:12:10.823  -->  00:12:12.475
So that's a big property.
260

260

00:12:12.475  -->  00:12:15.280
So basically what this means is that the pixel ratio
261

261

00:12:15.280  -->  00:12:18.363
of the device should be at least two.
262

262

00:12:19.226  -->  00:12:21.589
And what this two means is basically the two X
263

263

00:12:21.589  -->  00:12:23.393
that I've been explaining to you.
264

264

00:12:23.393  -->  00:12:25.790
So if the screen is at least two X
265

265

00:12:25.790  -->  00:12:28.960
because there's also three X or maybe even more,
266

266

00:12:28.960  -->  00:12:32.315
but anyway if it's at least two X which is really
267

267

00:12:32.315  -->  00:12:35.165
the same as having this resolution here at least.
268

268

00:12:35.165  -->  00:12:37.659
Well then this code here should apply.
269

269

00:12:37.659  -->  00:12:39.989
And so we had two conditions here
270

270

00:12:39.989  -->  00:12:42.173
with or and now we have three.
271

271

00:12:42.173  -->  00:12:45.808
So if this one happens or if this one happens
272

272

00:12:45.808  -->  00:12:47.890
which it's only gonna happen on Safari,
273

273

00:12:47.890  -->  00:12:49.524
and now the comma.
274

274

00:12:49.524  -->  00:12:51.774
Or if the min width is 125,
275

275

00:12:52.851  -->  00:12:55.512
then apply the bigger hero image.
276

276

00:12:55.512  -->  00:12:58.418
So let's take a look at that now in Safari.
277

277

00:12:58.418  -->  00:12:59.251
And voila.
278

278

00:12:59.251  -->  00:13:00.919
Now it works.
279

279

00:13:00.919  -->  00:13:01.752
Okay.
280

280

00:13:03.589  -->  00:13:06.481
Let's decrease that and so disappears
281

281

00:13:06.481  -->  00:13:08.369
at 600 pixels.
282

282

00:13:08.369  -->  00:13:09.202
Okay.
283

283

00:13:10.332  -->  00:13:13.040
So now we're ready to put it back
284

284

00:13:13.040  -->  00:13:15.290
at the primary green color.
285

285

00:13:18.784  -->  00:13:21.645
And so now it should work just as intended.
286

286

00:13:21.645  -->  00:13:24.605
So close it and let's get back to
287

287

00:13:24.605  -->  00:13:26.679
the older version of Firefox.
288

288

00:13:26.679  -->  00:13:28.274
And what you see here right away
289

289

00:13:28.274  -->  00:13:30.995
is that the clip path that we've been using
290

290

00:13:30.995  -->  00:13:32.480
is not really working here.
291

291

00:13:32.480  -->  00:13:34.127
And it's not working here.
292

292

00:13:34.127  -->  00:13:36.377
It's not working down here.
293

293

00:13:38.904  -->  00:13:40.709
And it's also not working here.
294

294

00:13:40.709  -->  00:13:43.271
And here it's actually causing a major problem.
295

295

00:13:43.271  -->  00:13:48.019
So in all the places where we used the clip path property
296

296

00:13:48.019  -->  00:13:49.979
it's not really working.
297

297

00:13:49.979  -->  00:13:53.089
So let me fix that right here in the header.
298

298

00:13:53.089  -->  00:13:55.390
And actually there's not much to fix
299

299

00:13:55.390  -->  00:13:57.326
but still just to show you how we can do it,
300

300

00:13:57.326  -->  00:14:00.329
I'm gonna do some changes here anyway.
301

301

00:14:00.329  -->  00:14:02.579
So let's close all of this.
302

302

00:14:04.308  -->  00:14:07.640
The card as well and then back to the header.
303

303

00:14:07.640  -->  00:14:09.667
So what do we want to happen with the header
304

304

00:14:09.667  -->  00:14:12.467
when clip path is not supported?
305

305

00:14:12.467  -->  00:14:15.221
Well I would say that in this case the entire header
306

306

00:14:15.221  -->  00:14:17.432
doesn't have to be all of this height.
307

307

00:14:17.432  -->  00:14:19.599
It could be a lot smaller.
308

308

00:14:21.281  -->  00:14:23.943
So let's write a feature query here.
309

309

00:14:23.943  -->  00:14:24.860
So supports
310

310

00:14:27.668  -->  00:14:31.060
and then we need to clip path property.
311

311

00:14:31.060  -->  00:14:32.982
And again we actually need to specify
312

312

00:14:32.982  -->  00:14:35.065
a value for the property.
313

313

00:14:36.819  -->  00:14:38.857
So polygon and now it doesn't really matter
314

314

00:14:38.857  -->  00:14:40.146
what we put here.
315

315

00:14:40.146  -->  00:14:41.923
It's really completely irrelevant.
316

316

00:14:41.923  -->  00:14:43.370
We just need to put anything.
317

317

00:14:43.370  -->  00:14:45.962
So we just put a zero zero coordinate.
318

318

00:14:45.962  -->  00:14:48.407
Just anything, it doesn't really matter.
319

319

00:14:48.407  -->  00:14:50.527
And then or, and we want the same thing here
320

320

00:14:50.527  -->  00:14:54.194
with the webkit prefix just as I did before.
321

321

00:14:57.682  -->  00:14:59.349
So webkit clip path.
322

322

00:15:01.174  -->  00:15:02.874
So and if this is supported,
323

323

00:15:02.874  -->  00:15:05.026
what do we want to happen?
324

324

00:15:05.026  -->  00:15:07.109
Well of course this here.
325

325

00:15:08.690  -->  00:15:10.383
So the clip path property will then be applied
326

326

00:15:10.383  -->  00:15:13.570
and only in that case we want the height of 95
327

327

00:15:13.570  -->  00:15:15.820
as we had in the beginning.
328

328

00:15:17.106  -->  00:15:21.605
And if it's not the case then let's just put like 85.
329

329

00:15:21.605  -->  00:15:23.406
And so that's better so the user knows
330

330

00:15:23.406  -->  00:15:27.519
that the page actually continues after this hero section.
331

331

00:15:27.519  -->  00:15:30.474
So let's take a look at that now.
332

332

00:15:30.474  -->  00:15:32.749
And it actually already worked.
333

333

00:15:32.749  -->  00:15:34.574
So you see that it's now smaller here
334

334

00:15:34.574  -->  00:15:37.303
and then down there, the webpage continues.
335

335

00:15:37.303  -->  00:15:39.235
And if you put this even smaller,
336

336

00:15:39.235  -->  00:15:42.068
like 80 view H then you would see,
337

337

00:15:43.119  -->  00:15:45.878
well it would be maybe a bit too much,
338

338

00:15:45.878  -->  00:15:47.930
but you get my point anyway, right?
339

339

00:15:47.930  -->  00:15:49.097
So this works.
340

340

00:15:50.218  -->  00:15:53.551
And that's what we really want to prove.
341

341

00:15:54.439  -->  00:15:57.666
Just to show you that in Safari here,
342

342

00:15:57.666  -->  00:16:00.418
even if we reload this, it still works
343

343

00:16:00.418  -->  00:16:02.296
the exact same way as before.
344

344

00:16:02.296  -->  00:16:04.829
So clip path is supported and then all of this code
345

345

00:16:04.829  -->  00:16:07.382
here gets applied and the height of 95
346

346

00:16:07.382  -->  00:16:10.973
overrides the height of 85 obviously.
347

347

00:16:10.973  -->  00:16:14.263
Now what was causing greater problems in Safari
348

348

00:16:14.263  -->  00:16:18.180
was actually down here.
349

349

00:16:19.038  -->  00:16:22.347
So let's just come up with a quick fix for that.
350

350

00:16:22.347  -->  00:16:24.904
So the test that we're gonna write
351

351

00:16:24.904  -->  00:16:27.092
is basically the same as this.
352

352

00:16:27.092  -->  00:16:31.003
And then it is in the story component.
353

353

00:16:31.003  -->  00:16:34.003
And so what element is that actually
354

354

00:16:34.968  -->  00:16:37.402
which it causes us the problem?
355

355

00:16:37.402  -->  00:16:38.479
And it's this one here.
356

356

00:16:38.479  -->  00:16:40.537
It's the shape, right?
357

357

00:16:40.537  -->  00:16:44.370
So let's include our feature query right here.
358

358

00:16:45.590  -->  00:16:47.980
And of course we don't want this to happen,
359

359

00:16:47.980  -->  00:16:52.147
but what we want to happen is of course here this clip path.
360

360

00:16:53.244  -->  00:16:55.751
And so we remove it from there and put it here.
361

361

00:16:55.751  -->  00:16:57.917
And so only if it's supported it gets applied
362

362

00:16:57.917  -->  00:17:02.369
and also only in this case, it needs to be this big
363

363

00:17:02.369  -->  00:17:06.202
because as you saw that image was way too big.
364

364

00:17:07.802  -->  00:17:09.883
So let's take a look at that now.
365

365

00:17:09.883  -->  00:17:13.792
And well now it actually looks the same and I believe I know
366

366

00:17:13.792  -->  00:17:15.501
why this is happening.
367

367

00:17:15.501  -->  00:17:18.655
Because actually it's the image that's causing the problem.
368

368

00:17:18.655  -->  00:17:23.163
So even if the shape has this 50 rem, height or width,
369

369

00:17:23.163  -->  00:17:26.257
the image that's in there still overlaps this element.
370

370

00:17:26.257  -->  00:17:29.674
So what we can do here is to say overflow
371

371

00:17:32.059  -->  00:17:33.467
hidden.
372

372

00:17:33.467  -->  00:17:35.325
So let's take a look at that now.
373

373

00:17:35.325  -->  00:17:39.242
And actually we can remove this part from here.
374

374

00:17:42.549  -->  00:17:43.546
And all right.
375

375

00:17:43.546  -->  00:17:45.743
So that's better, right
376

376

00:17:45.743  -->  00:17:46.950
so let me explain that again.
377

377

00:17:46.950  -->  00:17:49.922
So before we had this huge image here.
378

378

00:17:49.922  -->  00:17:51.408
So inspect the element.
379

379

00:17:51.408  -->  00:17:53.148
This is all in Portuguese here now
380

380

00:17:53.148  -->  00:17:56.866
but that shouldn't be a big problem.
381

381

00:17:56.866  -->  00:17:58.116
So story shape.
382

382

00:18:01.251  -->  00:18:02.796
And so yeah, that was the problem.
383

383

00:18:02.796  -->  00:18:05.643
And so the overflow hidden here, what it does
384

384

00:18:05.643  -->  00:18:08.287
it basically it cuts out the part of the image
385

385

00:18:08.287  -->  00:18:12.146
which is overflowing which is bigger than this element.
386

386

00:18:12.146  -->  00:18:14.527
Because you see this element has only this size.
387

387

00:18:14.527  -->  00:18:16.204
So inside of these blue lines.
388

388

00:18:16.204  -->  00:18:19.265
But the image as I see was a lot bigger.
389

389

00:18:19.265  -->  00:18:20.876
But if you use overflow hidden,
390

390

00:18:20.876  -->  00:18:24.105
then that hides that outside part.
391

391

00:18:24.105  -->  00:18:26.081
Now what you also see here is that the
392

392

00:18:26.081  -->  00:18:29.172
shape outside property is not known to Safari.
393

393

00:18:29.172  -->  00:18:31.899
So of course it's also not being applied here
394

394

00:18:31.899  -->  00:18:34.592
which was the reason why we actually used this clip path
395

395

00:18:34.592  -->  00:18:37.298
here and all of that stuff in the first place, right?
396

396

00:18:37.298  -->  00:18:41.999
So we can also put that one here in the feature query.
397

397

00:18:41.999  -->  00:18:43.976
Doesn't really change the functionality
398

398

00:18:43.976  -->  00:18:46.775
but at least then Firefox is not trying to understand
399

399

00:18:46.775  -->  00:18:48.525
what's going on here.
400

400

00:18:49.824  -->  00:18:51.343
Now just to make this round
401

401

00:18:51.343  -->  00:18:53.343
we can try border radius
402

402

00:18:55.918  -->  00:18:56.918
of 50%.
403

403

00:18:59.057  -->  00:19:01.675
And so now it's actually also round.
404

404

00:19:01.675  -->  00:19:03.392
So it looks actually similar
405

405

00:19:03.392  -->  00:19:04.871
to the way that it looked before.
406

406

00:19:04.871  -->  00:19:08.178
The only difference is that now it's not flowing here
407

407

00:19:08.178  -->  00:19:12.095
on this round side here outside of that circle.
408

408

00:19:14.152  -->  00:19:18.275
And so what we need to do in here is border radius
409

409

00:19:18.275  -->  00:19:19.295
and none.
410

410

00:19:19.295  -->  00:19:21.716
So if the clip path is actually supported
411

411

00:19:21.716  -->  00:19:24.471
then that border radius shouldn't be 50%.
412

412

00:19:24.471  -->  00:19:26.376
It shouldn't simply exist.
413

413

00:19:26.376  -->  00:19:30.543
So let's take a look at that now in Google Chrome.
414

414

00:19:31.771  -->  00:19:33.104
After reloading.
415

415

00:19:36.306  -->  00:19:38.381
And so it looks still fine in here.
416

416

00:19:38.381  -->  00:19:40.149
Of course the text is flowing around that
417

417

00:19:40.149  -->  00:19:41.149
and so yeah.
418

418

00:19:43.120  -->  00:19:44.776
Everything's good here.
419

419

00:19:44.776  -->  00:19:48.336
Everything is good on this older version of Firefox.
420

420

00:19:48.336  -->  00:19:50.807
So you still see some difference like for example
421

421

00:19:50.807  -->  00:19:53.546
this here is showing while on Google Chrome it's not.
422

422

00:19:53.546  -->  00:19:54.736
But that's not a problem.
423

423

00:19:54.736  -->  00:19:56.920
It doesn't make any difference.
424

424

00:19:56.920  -->  00:20:00.303
So everything still works the same.
425

425

00:20:00.303  -->  00:20:02.528
This red border here is just a default functionality
426

426

00:20:02.528  -->  00:20:06.008
of Firefox when a field is not correct,
427

427

00:20:06.008  -->  00:20:08.670
but that's not a problem.
428

428

00:20:08.670  -->  00:20:10.420
And so yeah, it works
429

429

00:20:11.256  -->  00:20:13.859
at least in this version of Firefox.
430

430

00:20:13.859  -->  00:20:15.935
So let me close that one as well.
431

431

00:20:15.935  -->  00:20:17.762
And now we could of course continue doing that
432

432

00:20:17.762  -->  00:20:20.239
for all the different properties that may not
433

433

00:20:20.239  -->  00:20:22.865
be really well supported by the older browsers.
434

434

00:20:22.865  -->  00:20:26.063
So for example we could take a look at
435

435

00:20:26.063  -->  00:20:28.230
the one that we used here.
436

436

00:20:31.084  -->  00:20:33.325
The background clip property here that we used.
437

437

00:20:33.325  -->  00:20:35.996
So maybe that one is also not supported on some of the
438

438

00:20:35.996  -->  00:20:39.484
not so modern browsers and so you could check for that.
439

439

00:20:39.484  -->  00:20:42.949
And then simply make the text for example just green if
440

440

00:20:42.949  -->  00:20:44.956
background clip is not supported.
441

441

00:20:44.956  -->  00:20:47.808
Right now I don't have any other browsers here to test
442

442

00:20:47.808  -->  00:20:49.825
and so I'm not going to do that.
443

443

00:20:49.825  -->  00:20:53.294
But once again such as I've been doing in this section now
444

444

00:20:53.294  -->  00:20:56.774
is that I'm gonna leave that as challenge for you.
445

445

00:20:56.774  -->  00:21:00.189
So now armed with this knowledge about the feature queries
446

446

00:21:00.189  -->  00:21:04.364
and the Can I Use tool here which is really, really useful,
447

447

00:21:04.364  -->  00:21:07.354
you can now go ahead and take a look at these
448

448

00:21:07.354  -->  00:21:09.527
modern features that I showed you and then try
449

449

00:21:09.527  -->  00:21:12.201
to implement a graceful degradations for all the browsers
450

450

00:21:12.201  -->  00:21:14.455
for each of these properties.
451

451

00:21:14.455  -->  00:21:17.099
All right this was just another really fun lecture.
452

452

00:21:17.099  -->  00:21:19.926
Really important as well with the feature queries
453

453

00:21:19.926  -->  00:21:22.731
and also a really great new property that I showed you
454

454

00:21:22.731  -->  00:21:25.333
which allows for this really cool background blur.
455

455

00:21:25.333  -->  00:21:27.056
And I'm sure that you can have a lot of ideas
456

456

00:21:27.056  -->  00:21:29.851
on where to implement and use that one.
457

457

00:21:29.851  -->  00:21:32.301
So I hope that you take that challenge now,
458

458

00:21:32.301  -->  00:21:34.083
implement some more feature queries
