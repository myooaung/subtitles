1

00:00:01,247  -->  00:00:02,992
<v Jonas>So let's finish up the gallery</v>
2

2

00:00:02,992  -->  00:00:05,006
that we were building.
3

3

00:00:05,006  -->  00:00:08,543
And I actually want to do this as a small challenge for you.
4

4

00:00:08,543  -->  00:00:11,121
So you already know how it's gonna look like in the end,
5

5

00:00:11,121  -->  00:00:13,216
and so I'm sure that you're gonna be able
6

6

00:00:13,216  -->  00:00:16,347
to place all the remaining 13 images here
7

7

00:00:16,347  -->  00:00:19,269
on the grid, just like this.
8

8

00:00:19,269  -->  00:00:20,979 line:15% 
So I'm sure you can do it,
9

9

00:00:20,979  -->  00:00:22,604 line:15% 
and so pause the video now,
10

10

00:00:22,604  -->  00:00:24,512 line:15% 
and I'm gonna be back in a minute
11

11

00:00:24,512  -->  00:00:27,345 line:15% 
and show you how I did solve this.
12

12

00:00:29,517  -->  00:00:31,412 line:15% 
So, did you manage to do it?
13

13

00:00:31,412  -->  00:00:33,418
Let me now show you my solution,
14

14

00:00:33,418  -->  00:00:35,453
so my way of doing this.
15

15

00:00:35,453  -->  00:00:37,091
And first of all, I'm gonna include
16

16

00:00:37,091  -->  00:00:39,758
all of the images in the markup.
17

17

00:00:44,368  -->  00:00:45,545
Now instead of copying this here
18

18

00:00:45,545  -->  00:00:48,042
and then changing this number one
19

19

00:00:48,042  -->  00:00:51,398
here in the item, in the name, and the alt text,
20

20

00:00:51,398  -->  00:00:54,540
I'm going to use Emmet to actually do all of this
21

21

00:00:54,540  -->  00:00:56,453
in one line of code.
22

22

00:00:56,453  -->  00:00:59,994
Okay, so this is going to be the most complex Emmet code
23

23

00:00:59,994  -->  00:01:02,002
that we ever wrote.
24

24

00:01:02,002  -->  00:01:05,230
So let me show you how I did it.
25

25

00:01:05,230  -->  00:01:09,147
So we want a figure with the name gallery_item,
26

26

00:01:11,683  -->  00:01:15,144
so nothing new up until this point.
27

27

00:01:15,144  -->  00:01:17,561
And also gallery_item number,
28

28

00:01:20,785  -->  00:01:23,588
and then automatic numbering here again, right.
29

29

00:01:23,588  -->  00:01:26,171
Then in there, we want an image
30

30

00:01:27,812  -->  00:01:29,562
called gallery_image.
31

31

00:01:31,463  -->  00:01:34,836
And now we can also specify the attributes here.
32

32

00:01:34,836  -->  00:01:38,688
And that's using the square brackets, just like this.
33

33

00:01:38,688  -->  00:01:42,521
So we can say that the source should be image,
34

34

00:01:44,336  -->  00:01:47,503
gal, and then the number
and then JPEG.
35

35

00:01:48,959  -->  00:01:51,797
And that works because the images that we used for this
36

36

00:01:51,797  -->  00:01:52,792
are named like this,
37

37

00:01:52,792  -->  00:01:55,126
like gallery one, two, three, four, five,
38

38

00:01:55,126  -->  00:01:57,053
all the way to 14.
39

39

00:01:57,053  -->  00:02:00,134
And so that's why we can use this numbering here as well.
40

40

00:02:00,134  -->  00:02:02,629
So that's the source attribute,
41

41

00:02:02,629  -->  00:02:06,839
and then I can also specify the alt attribute.
42

42

00:02:06,839  -->  00:02:07,672
And so,
43

43

00:02:10,160  -->  00:02:12,827
gallery image and then a number.
44

44

00:02:14,162  -->  00:02:17,437
Okay, and now that, so that Emmet understands this really,
45

45

00:02:17,437  -->  00:02:20,232
let me put this here in parenthesis
46

46

00:02:20,232  -->  00:02:22,173
and then write 14 times,
47

47

00:02:22,173  -->  00:02:24,506
hit tab, and bam!
Here we go.
48

48

00:02:25,367  -->  00:02:28,381
So we have now all of these 14 figures
49

49

00:02:28,381  -->  00:02:32,703
with the 14 images, all named from one to 14
50

50

00:02:32,703  -->  00:02:36,120
such as the image names and the alt text.
51

51

00:02:37,402  -->  00:02:40,987
So I can now get rid of this first part here
52

52

00:02:40,987  -->  00:02:44,154
which is exactly the same as this one.
53

53

00:02:45,179  -->  00:02:47,463
So let's check it out here.
54

54

00:02:47,463  -->  00:02:51,926
And indeed, here we have our 14 different images.
55

55

00:02:51,926  -->  00:02:53,996
Now all we have to do is to place them
56

56

00:02:53,996  -->  00:02:56,238
on the grid just like this.
57

57

00:02:56,238  -->  00:03:00,166
And so let's actually use this one here as a reference.
58

58

00:03:00,166  -->  00:03:02,724
So again, in order to come up with this layout here,
59

59

00:03:02,724  -->  00:03:05,555
I had to go through kind of a lot of experimentation,
60

60

00:03:05,555  -->  00:03:08,846
but that would way too much to do in a video like this,
61

61

00:03:08,846  -->  00:03:11,185
and so I'm just gonna place them like they are here
62

62

00:03:11,185  -->  00:03:14,055
and if you wanna go through all that experimentation
63

63

00:03:14,055  -->  00:03:16,705
by yourself, then please feel free to do that.
64

64

00:03:16,705  -->  00:03:19,618
So you can of course try to position them
65

65

00:03:19,618  -->  00:03:21,345
in a completely different way,
66

66

00:03:21,345  -->  00:03:24,163
and try to come up with your own gallery.
67

67

00:03:24,163  -->  00:03:27,120
But I'm just gonna show you the way that I did this.
68

68

00:03:27,120  -->  00:03:29,318
So this one here is the second one,
69

69

00:03:29,318  -->  00:03:32,057
and we see that it starts on column number one,
70

70

00:03:32,057  -->  00:03:34,698
and then spans across three tracks,
71

71

00:03:34,698  -->  00:03:35,938
and the same four lines.
72

72

00:03:35,938  -->  00:03:39,989
So from line one, spanning across three tracks.
73

73

00:03:39,989  -->  00:03:41,656
So, let's copy this.
74

74

00:03:46,740  -->  00:03:49,481
So grid-row and span three,
75

75

00:03:49,481  -->  00:03:52,163
and grid-column starts on number three,
76

76

00:03:52,163  -->  00:03:55,210
so line number three, and spans across three.
77

77

00:03:55,210  -->  00:03:57,877
And of course, here, number two.
78

78

00:03:59,493  -->  00:04:00,660
And that's it.
79

79

00:04:01,930  -->  00:04:03,680
So next up, from one,
80

80

00:04:05,207  -->  00:04:08,707
and spanning two rows and just one column.
81

81

00:04:12,448  -->  00:04:15,219
So number three from row one, spanning two,
82

82

00:04:15,219  -->  00:04:17,012
and then just one column.
83

83

00:04:17,012  -->  00:04:20,929
So just from column one to column number three.
84

84

00:04:25,141  -->  00:04:26,808
Just to confirm, oh,
85

85

00:04:26,808  -->  00:04:28,710
something didn't go quite well,
86

86

00:04:28,710  -->  00:04:31,489
and yeah of course it starts at column six
87

87

00:04:31,489  -->  00:04:33,220
and goes to seven,
88

88

00:04:33,220  -->  00:04:35,720
so that's of course a mistake.
89

89

00:04:38,864  -->  00:04:40,595
But now that's fixed.
90

90

00:04:40,595  -->  00:04:42,798
So next one occupies then
91

91

00:04:42,798  -->  00:04:45,326
all the way until the end of the grid
92

92

00:04:45,326  -->  00:04:46,993
and across two rows.
93

93

00:04:51,028  -->  00:04:52,278
So number four,
94

94

00:04:54,660  -->  00:04:56,734
grid-row and spans two,
95

95

00:04:56,734  -->  00:05:00,317
and the columns, it starts at number eight,
96

96

00:05:02,935  -->  00:05:05,435
and until the end of the grid.
97

97

00:05:08,185  -->  00:05:11,758
And actually it starts at number seven,
98

98

00:05:11,758  -->  00:05:13,297
okay so grid line number seven,
99

99

00:05:13,297  -->  00:05:16,204
and of course, yeah that was kind of obvious
100

100

00:05:16,204  -->  00:05:19,165
because this one ended at line number seven
101

101

00:05:19,165  -->  00:05:21,179
and so this one of course had to start
102

102

00:05:21,179  -->  00:05:23,512
at line number seven, right.
103

103

00:05:27,817  -->  00:05:30,767
So next one then here starts at line
104

104

00:05:30,767  -->  00:05:33,392
number three and goes all the way
105

105

00:05:33,392  -->  00:05:34,480
to line number six.
106

106

00:05:34,480  -->  00:05:36,592
So it spans across three rows,
107

107

00:05:36,592  -->  00:05:39,009
and spans across two columns.
108

108

00:05:40,467  -->  00:05:42,623
And so now you can actually see how useful it is
109

109

00:05:42,623  -->  00:05:45,508
to use these Firefox dev tools for grid
110

110

00:05:45,508  -->  00:05:48,840
because without it, we would have a hard time
111

111

00:05:48,840  -->  00:05:50,888
of course visualizing this grid,
112

112

00:05:50,888  -->  00:05:54,888
and then also keeping track of the line numbers.
113

113

00:05:59,185  -->  00:06:03,352
So it's really great by Mozilla that they did it like this.
114

114

00:06:04,501  -->  00:06:06,868
Okay, started grid-row number three
115

115

00:06:06,868  -->  00:06:09,416
and spans across three, and two columns.
116

116

00:06:09,416  -->  00:06:11,749
I think it's good like this.
117

117

00:06:14,215  -->  00:06:16,163
Yeah, so that looks good.
118

118

00:06:16,163  -->  00:06:17,373
Next one, we have this one here
119

119

00:06:17,373  -->  00:06:18,347
with the pool,
120

120

00:06:18,347  -->  00:06:20,638
and it starts at number four,
121

121

00:06:20,638  -->  00:06:23,145
spanning two rows and starts at column number three,
122

122

00:06:23,145  -->  00:06:24,895
spanning two as well.
123

123

00:06:32,353  -->  00:06:33,603
Four and three.
124

124

00:06:38,863  -->  00:06:40,570
Okay, now maybe this may seem
125

125

00:06:40,570  -->  00:06:42,541
like a bit of a boring task,
126

126

00:06:42,541  -->  00:06:45,339
to having to align all these items like this
127

127

00:06:45,339  -->  00:06:48,339
and I kind of agree with that,
128

128

00:06:48,339  -->  00:06:50,262
but there's really no way around it.
129

129

00:06:50,262  -->  00:06:51,651
And of course if you were to do this
130

130

00:06:51,651  -->  00:06:53,255
without the grid, then it would be
131

131

00:06:53,255  -->  00:06:54,683
1000 times worse.
132

132

00:06:54,683  -->  00:06:57,417
Okay, so I'm really thankful for having this method
133

133

00:06:57,417  -->  00:07:00,000
and I'm not complaining at all.
134

134

00:07:00,855  -->  00:07:02,276
So the next one is this here,
135

135

00:07:02,276  -->  00:07:05,776
and it starts at row four and column five.
136

136

00:07:06,640  -->  00:07:08,057
So four and five.
137

137

00:07:14,744  -->  00:07:15,994
Four, and five.
138

138

00:07:17,686  -->  00:07:21,049
And actually, four and five here.
139

139

00:07:21,049  -->  00:07:22,966
And it's only one cell.
140

140

00:07:24,964  -->  00:07:26,964
And so that should work.
141

141

00:07:29,637  -->  00:07:31,103
Yeah.
142

142

00:07:31,103  -->  00:07:33,241
Next up, there's this one here
143

143

00:07:33,241  -->  00:07:35,760
starting from row three
144

144

00:07:35,760  -->  00:07:37,010
and column six.
145

145

00:07:42,161  -->  00:07:43,661
So three, and six.
146

146

00:07:47,396  -->  00:07:48,729
At number eight.
147

147

00:07:51,409  -->  00:07:54,094
Yep!
The next one is this here,
148

148

00:07:54,094  -->  00:07:57,036
starting from row number three,
149

149

00:07:57,036  -->  00:07:59,231
and column number eight.
150

150

00:07:59,231  -->  00:08:03,186
And it goes all the way across three tracks,
151

151

00:08:03,186  -->  00:08:04,853
so three row tracks.
152

152

00:08:08,591  -->  00:08:12,378
So row three, and span across three,
153

153

00:08:12,378  -->  00:08:14,211
and grid-column eight,
154

154

00:08:17,224  -->  00:08:19,641
to minus one.
So the last one.
155

155

00:08:25,210  -->  00:08:27,049
So perfect again.
156

156

00:08:27,049  -->  00:08:29,413
And only five more to go.
157

157

00:08:29,413  -->  00:08:32,608
So the next one is this one here.
158

158

00:08:32,608  -->  00:08:36,191
So row number six, spanning two row tracks.
159

159

00:08:42,379  -->  00:08:46,046
And of course column from number one to two.
160

160

00:08:48,111  -->  00:08:49,361
Number ten now.
161

161

00:08:53,654  -->  00:08:54,686
There you go.
162

162

00:08:54,686  -->  00:08:58,741
And now the next one, from row six to row eight,
163

163

00:08:58,741  -->  00:09:00,658
and column two to four.
164

164

00:09:06,453  -->  00:09:07,786
So six, and two,
165

165

00:09:09,874  -->  00:09:11,791
spanning two.
I believe.
166

166

00:09:15,491  -->  00:09:16,991
And yeah, kind of.
167

167

00:09:17,837  -->  00:09:20,337
It's number 11 here of course.
168

168

00:09:21,553  -->  00:09:22,811
Yeah, so that's better.
169

169

00:09:22,811  -->  00:09:26,509
And now we can already see how the next ones will be,
170

170

00:09:26,509  -->  00:09:29,182
so the next one is going to fill up this remaining space,
171

171

00:09:29,182  -->  00:09:32,599
and then this one will fill up this here,
172

172

00:09:33,551  -->  00:09:36,512
and then the last one will probably fill up this space here.
173

173

00:09:36,512  -->  00:09:37,651
So let's confirm that,
174

174

00:09:37,651  -->  00:09:39,520
and yeah, so this space here,
175

175

00:09:39,520  -->  00:09:41,227
then this one,
176

176

00:09:41,227  -->  00:09:43,226
and then this one.
177

177

00:09:43,226  -->  00:09:47,393
So the next one starts at row six and column four.
178

178

00:09:52,483  -->  00:09:54,066
So let's copy that.
179

179

00:09:57,901  -->  00:09:59,234
And column four.
180

180

00:10:01,040  -->  00:10:04,873
And yeah, it actually doesn't span the column.
181

181

00:10:06,682  -->  00:10:08,932
So just column number five.
182

182

00:10:10,820  -->  00:10:13,559
The next one we don't have to actually see the solution,
183

183

00:10:13,559  -->  00:10:15,401
we already know that it's gonna be here.
184

184

00:10:15,401  -->  00:10:18,229
So from row five and column five,
185

185

00:10:18,229  -->  00:10:22,146
spanning across three tracks in each direction.
186

186

00:10:24,245  -->  00:10:25,745
So five, five, and
187

187

00:10:27,789  -->  00:10:29,622
spanning three tracks.
188

188

00:10:32,105  -->  00:10:33,917
Oh and something's wrong there.
189

189

00:10:33,917  -->  00:10:36,834
Ah, (sighs) right.
190

190

00:10:39,285  -->  00:10:41,068
And now just one to go.
191

191

00:10:41,068  -->  00:10:43,353
So this one is from row six
192

192

00:10:43,353  -->  00:10:45,353
and column number eight.
193

193

00:10:48,521  -->  00:10:51,463
Row six, span two so that's correct.
194

194

00:10:51,463  -->  00:10:52,880
And column eight,
195

195

00:10:55,478  -->  00:10:56,561
to minus one.
196

196

00:10:57,419  -->  00:10:59,249
Don't forget to change this,
197

197

00:10:59,249  -->  00:11:01,191
and that is it.
198

198

00:11:01,191  -->  00:11:02,608
Alright, awesome.
199

199

00:11:03,841  -->  00:11:06,238
So our images are nicely aligned here,
200

200

00:11:06,238  -->  00:11:07,358
let's take a look at it
201

201

00:11:07,358  -->  00:11:09,525
without this grid overlay.
202

202

00:11:11,171  -->  00:11:13,366
And yeah, so that looks fantastic.
203

203

00:11:13,366  -->  00:11:15,991
And it's all thanks of the grid of course,
204

204

00:11:15,991  -->  00:11:18,242
and of the object fit property.
205

205

00:11:18,242  -->  00:11:20,623
So lets actually take that one out
206

206

00:11:20,623  -->  00:11:24,706
so just to see how it would look like without it.
207

207

00:11:28,295  -->  00:11:30,842
And also without the height property here.
208

208

00:11:30,842  -->  00:11:34,259
So that is how it would look like, right.
209

209

00:11:35,495  -->  00:11:38,632
So if we would just place the images on the grid
210

210

00:11:38,632  -->  00:11:42,311
and they would try to keep their intrinsic aspect ratios,
211

211

00:11:42,311  -->  00:11:45,587
then that's the result we would end up with.
212

212

00:11:45,587  -->  00:11:47,420
So that's a bit weird.
213

213

00:11:48,276  -->  00:11:50,586
If we then set the height to 100%,
214

214

00:11:50,586  -->  00:11:54,754
then we would keep our gaps here very nicely,
215

215

00:11:54,754  -->  00:11:56,658
but then the aspect ratio would be gone
216

216

00:11:56,658  -->  00:11:59,388
and we would end up with weird results
217

217

00:11:59,388  -->  00:12:01,658
like this one, where the image is very stretched
218

218

00:12:01,658  -->  00:12:04,738
or here, you can also see it very stretched,
219

219

00:12:04,738  -->  00:12:06,207
and also here.
220

220

00:12:06,207  -->  00:12:08,427
And so that's not what we want at all,
221

221

00:12:08,427  -->  00:12:10,224
and so object fit,
222

222

00:12:10,224  -->  00:12:12,571
see the difference now?
223

223

00:12:12,571  -->  00:12:16,382
So object fit is really what makes this possible,
224

224

00:12:16,382  -->  00:12:18,513
along with, of course, CSS grid.
225

225

00:12:18,513  -->  00:12:19,916
So I hope you liked that,
226

226

00:12:19,916  -->  00:12:22,249
and see you in the next one.
