<v Instructor>This lecture is called</v>
2

2

00:00:02,864  -->  00:00:05,663
A Brief Intro to the Command Line.
3

3

00:00:05,663  -->  00:00:07,401
Yeah, you heard that right.
4

4

00:00:07,401  -->  00:00:09,947
There comes a time in every web developer's life
5

5

00:00:09,947  -->  00:00:12,026
where you have to learn at least the basics
6

6

00:00:12,026  -->  00:00:13,747
of the command line.
7

7

00:00:13,747  -->  00:00:17,889
I know that many, many people are afraid of the command line
8

8

00:00:17,889  -->  00:00:19,228
for some reason.
9

9

00:00:19,228  -->  00:00:22,939
I was afraid myself some years ago, I admit that.
10

10

00:00:22,939  -->  00:00:24,913
But now I love the command line
11

11

00:00:24,913  -->  00:00:27,004
and really can't live without it.
12

12

00:00:27,004  -->  00:00:29,272
A so can't any serious web developer.
13

13

00:00:29,272  -->  00:00:31,453
It's just part of the job.
14

14

00:00:31,453  -->  00:00:33,559
Now in our case, in this project,
15

15

00:00:33,559  -->  00:00:35,828
that is because we now want to install
16

16

00:00:35,828  -->  00:00:39,308
and compile SASS locally and we're gonna do all of that
17

17

00:00:39,308  -->  00:00:40,564
in the command line.
18

18

00:00:40,564  -->  00:00:42,843
So you need to know at least the basics,
19

19

00:00:42,843  -->  00:00:45,232
like moving around in the file system,
20

20

00:00:45,232  -->  00:00:48,001
creating files and folders, copying files
21

21

00:00:48,001  -->  00:00:49,680
and stuff like that.
22

22

00:00:49,680  -->  00:00:52,626
Believe me, it's really easy and at some point,
23

23

00:00:52,626  -->  00:00:54,688
it even becomes fun because you're gonna look
24

24

00:00:54,688  -->  00:00:58,564
like a real pro, so that's really cool.
25

25

00:00:58,564  -->  00:01:01,823
Now if already know this stuff, if you're already familiar
26

26

00:01:01,823  -->  00:01:04,456
with it, using the command line, then please feel free
27

27

00:01:04,456  -->  00:01:07,078
to move on to the next lecture as you're probably
28

28

00:01:07,078  -->  00:01:09,583
not gonna learn anything new here.
29

29

00:01:09,583  -->  00:01:13,159
But for the rest of us, let's now jump into a command line.
30

30

00:01:13,159  -->  00:01:15,731
If you're on a Mac, you can just open up
31

31

00:01:15,731  -->  00:01:18,833
the app called terminal and then you're there.
32

32

00:01:18,833  -->  00:01:20,083
Maybe it looks different to you,
33

33

00:01:20,083  -->  00:01:21,919
maybe it's white or something,
34

34

00:01:21,919  -->  00:01:23,825
but it's essentially the same.
35

35

00:01:23,825  -->  00:01:25,432
I'm gonna increase this a little bit
36

36

00:01:25,432  -->  00:01:28,711
so that you can actually see what I'm doing here.
37

37

00:01:28,711  -->  00:01:31,661
All right, so this is how it works on a Mac.
38

38

00:01:31,661  -->  00:01:33,753
If you're watching this video on Windows,
39

39

00:01:33,753  -->  00:01:36,477
which is probably most of the people watching this course,
40

40

00:01:36,477  -->  00:01:39,468
then you can just right click on the start button
41

41

00:01:39,468  -->  00:01:41,897
and from there, select the command prompt.
42

42

00:01:41,897  -->  00:01:44,372
So in Windows, it's called command prompt.
43

43

00:01:44,372  -->  00:01:46,379
Actually some of the commands are different
44

44

00:01:46,379  -->  00:01:48,117
and some are the same.
45

45

00:01:48,117  -->  00:01:50,338
Each time they are different in Windows,
46

46

00:01:50,338  -->  00:01:52,827
then of course I'm gonna tell you, okay?
47

47

00:01:52,827  -->  00:01:55,128
So keep paying attention to that.
48

48

00:01:55,128  -->  00:01:57,187
Now the fundamental aspect of the command line,
49

49

00:01:57,187  -->  00:01:59,501
is that you're always in a folder.
50

50

00:01:59,501  -->  00:02:02,300
We use commands to move inside the folder structure
51

51

00:02:02,300  -->  00:02:05,629
to create files, to move files, to create folders
52

52

00:02:05,629  -->  00:02:07,278
and all of that stuff.
53

53

00:02:07,278  -->  00:02:09,842
Right now, I'm here in the home folder.
54

54

00:02:09,842  -->  00:02:12,156
If I want to see the contents of that folder,
55

55

00:02:12,156  -->  00:02:15,410
I simply type ls and then hit return.
56

56

00:02:15,410  -->  00:02:16,941
On Windows, this is different.
57

57

00:02:16,941  -->  00:02:20,865
On Windows, it's dir, which stands for directory.
58

58

00:02:20,865  -->  00:02:24,656
So on Windows, don't type ls, type dir.
59

59

00:02:24,656  -->  00:02:26,571
These are the files or the folders
60

60

00:02:26,571  -->  00:02:28,633
that are in my home folder.
61

61

00:02:28,633  -->  00:02:30,565
So applications, documents, library, music,
62

62

00:02:30,565  -->  00:02:32,728
desktop, downloads, movies and pictures.
63

63

00:02:32,728  -->  00:02:35,055
For you, it's probably gonna look different,
64

64

00:02:35,055  -->  00:02:37,026
that's because each system is different.
65

65

00:02:37,026  -->  00:02:40,342
Now if I wanted to move inside of one of these folders,
66

66

00:02:40,342  -->  00:02:43,662
then I type cd, which stands for change directory,
67

67

00:02:43,662  -->  00:02:44,954
and then the name of the folder.
68

68

00:02:44,954  -->  00:02:49,517
So I write desktop if I want to move to the desktop.
69

69

00:02:49,517  -->  00:02:51,818
Until now, you can see that here it actually says desktop
70

70

00:02:51,818  -->  00:02:53,721
and so now we're in a different folder.
71

71

00:02:53,721  -->  00:02:57,354
Now I can do ls again, to see what's in that folder
72

72

00:02:57,354  -->  00:02:59,681
and on Windows, don't forget it's dir.
73

73

00:02:59,681  -->  00:03:02,762
So what I have in here is the Nators folder.
74

74

00:03:02,762  -->  00:03:05,089
If you take a look at the desktop, that's true
75

75

00:03:05,089  -->  00:03:07,911
so in here is the Nators folder.
76

76

00:03:07,911  -->  00:03:10,015
Now if I want to to go back to where I was,
77

77

00:03:10,015  -->  00:03:13,491
I simply type cd.. and that moves me up
78

78

00:03:13,491  -->  00:03:17,663
in the folder structure so I'm back to the home folder,
79

79

00:03:17,663  -->  00:03:21,384
which on a Mac is called this weird symbol here.
80

80

00:03:21,384  -->  00:03:25,221
So if I type ls now, I am back to what I had before up here.
81

81

00:03:25,221  -->  00:03:26,425
Right?
82

82

00:03:26,425  -->  00:03:29,711
Okay, let's suppose I want to move back to the desktop.
83

83

00:03:29,711  -->  00:03:33,587
I write cd and I start writing d and the e
84

84

00:03:33,587  -->  00:03:37,682
so now I can hit tab and it will auto complete the name.
85

85

00:03:37,682  -->  00:03:40,657
That's because they're now on a folder or file in here
86

86

00:03:40,657  -->  00:03:42,718
which starts with de.
87

87

00:03:42,718  -->  00:03:44,281
So it knows that this is the only folder
88

88

00:03:44,281  -->  00:03:47,240
that I can go to and so it auto completes this for me.
89

89

00:03:47,240  -->  00:03:50,477
So I'm back at the desktop and now I can go to the folder
90

90

00:03:50,477  -->  00:03:52,765
that I know was there, which is called 1 Natours.
91

91

00:03:52,765  -->  00:03:56,432
I write cd1, hit tab and it's already there.
92

92

00:03:57,950  -->  00:04:00,127
And now I'm in the project folder
93

93

00:04:00,127  -->  00:04:01,837
which we have been working in.
94

94

00:04:01,837  -->  00:04:05,491
So ls, just as he was in there, and we have the CSS folder,
95

95

00:04:05,491  -->  00:04:08,674
the IMG folder and the nx.html.
96

96

00:04:08,674  -->  00:04:10,471
This terminal window is already getting
97

97

00:04:10,471  -->  00:04:13,282
really crowded for texts, so I can just write clear
98

98

00:04:13,282  -->  00:04:16,449
and return and it clears up my window.
99

99

00:04:18,055  -->  00:04:20,442
This is just for aesthetical reasons.
100

100

00:04:20,442  -->  00:04:23,257
Actually this auto complete function also works on command.
101

101

00:04:23,257  -->  00:04:27,470
So if I start writing cle, then it already knows
102

102

00:04:27,470  -->  00:04:30,311
that I want to write clear, so that's it.
103

103

00:04:30,311  -->  00:04:32,272
Now imagine that in here, in my project folder,
104

104

00:04:32,272  -->  00:04:35,083
I want to create a new folder for JavaScript.
105

105

00:04:35,083  -->  00:04:37,634
I can use the command mkdir,
106

106

00:04:37,634  -->  00:04:39,506
which stands for make directory.
107

107

00:04:39,506  -->  00:04:42,701
Then, just a name, js and with that,
108

108

00:04:42,701  -->  00:04:44,485
we created a new directory.
109

109

00:04:44,485  -->  00:04:48,168
But not ever still in the Natours directory, right?
110

110

00:04:48,168  -->  00:04:51,418
So let's see, but actually it is there.
111

111

00:04:52,481  -->  00:04:55,327
So we successfully created a directory.
112

112

00:04:55,327  -->  00:04:59,244
So let's move into it, so cdjs and we're there.
113

113

00:05:00,878  -->  00:05:03,991
Now we're in the JavaScript folder.
114

114

00:05:03,991  -->  00:05:06,096
Let's suppose you want to create a bunch of files.
115

115

00:05:06,096  -->  00:05:08,367
You could, of course, go to our text editor
116

116

00:05:08,367  -->  00:05:11,267
and create each of these files one by one.
117

117

00:05:11,267  -->  00:05:13,257
But we can also use the terminal,
118

118

00:05:13,257  -->  00:05:14,698
which I think is a lot easier.
119

119

00:05:14,698  -->  00:05:16,762
You just write the command touch
120

120

00:05:16,762  -->  00:05:20,017
and on Windows, it's called edit, I believe.
121

121

00:05:20,017  -->  00:05:21,772
And so then you can write the names
122

122

00:05:21,772  -->  00:05:23,169
of the files that you want.
123

123

00:05:23,169  -->  00:05:27,441
Let's say script.js and you can put multiple here
124

124

00:05:27,441  -->  00:05:29,441
so index.js and test.js.
125

125

00:05:31,894  -->  00:05:33,025
Hit return and that's it.
126

126

00:05:33,025  -->  00:05:35,913
Let's now check it out and, in fact,
127

127

00:05:35,913  -->  00:05:37,192
they're all there.
128

128

00:05:37,192  -->  00:05:39,578
We can, of course, confirm this in the file system here
129

129

00:05:39,578  -->  00:05:42,924
so, of course, the JavaScript folder is here
130

130

00:05:42,924  -->  00:05:46,091
and the three files are there as well.
131

131

00:05:48,033  -->  00:05:49,553
Another thing that we can do is
132

132

00:05:49,553  -->  00:05:52,526
to copy or to move files, of course.
133

133

00:05:52,526  -->  00:05:55,547
Let's say that we actually want the index.js file,
134

134

00:05:55,547  -->  00:05:58,182
not in here but in the project folder,
135

135

00:05:58,182  -->  00:05:59,893
in the main project folder.
136

136

00:05:59,893  -->  00:06:02,810
What we can do is to say cp and on Windows
137

137

00:06:02,810  -->  00:06:05,874
it's called copy, then just the name of the file, index
138

138

00:06:05,874  -->  00:06:09,088
and see how I did the (mumbles), so it auto completed,
139

139

00:06:09,088  -->  00:06:12,034
automatically completed the file name for me
140

140

00:06:12,034  -->  00:06:15,313
so copy, index.js which is the name of the file
141

141

00:06:15,313  -->  00:06:17,984
and then the directory where we want it to copy.
142

142

00:06:17,984  -->  00:06:20,165
If we want the project folder which is one layer above,
143

143

00:06:20,165  -->  00:06:24,685
we simply type .. and .. always means the folder
144

144

00:06:24,685  -->  00:06:25,791
that is above.
145

145

00:06:25,791  -->  00:06:28,591
Remember how we wanted to move up in the file system?
146

146

00:06:28,591  -->  00:06:31,167
We used cd.. so that's the same.
147

147

00:06:31,167  -->  00:06:34,039
So .. always means the folder which is above
148

148

00:06:34,039  -->  00:06:35,291
in the file system.
149

149

00:06:35,291  -->  00:06:37,370
What this is gonna do, is to copy the file
150

150

00:06:37,370  -->  00:06:39,285
into the folder above.
151

151

00:06:39,285  -->  00:06:42,231
All right, let's check it out.
152

152

00:06:42,231  -->  00:06:46,722
Index.js is still here, and if you're now going up
153

153

00:06:46,722  -->  00:06:49,812
and check what's in there, then here, the index.js file
154

154

00:06:49,812  -->  00:06:51,229
is also in there,
155

155

00:06:52,365  -->  00:06:53,657
so great.
156

156

00:06:53,657  -->  00:06:55,811
Now suppose we want to move one of the files
157

157

00:06:55,811  -->  00:06:57,390
that is in the js folder.
158

158

00:06:57,390  -->  00:07:01,055
Let's go there, let's take a look.
159

159

00:07:01,055  -->  00:07:04,767
So now we want to move the script.js file also
160

160

00:07:04,767  -->  00:07:06,284
into the project folder.
161

161

00:07:06,284  -->  00:07:10,424
So we simply type mv, or on Windows, move.
162

162

00:07:10,424  -->  00:07:14,902
Now it's the same thing, so let's just say script..
163

163

00:07:14,902  -->  00:07:18,376
The difference is that the file should be gone
164

164

00:07:18,376  -->  00:07:20,293
from this folder, so ls
165

165

00:07:21,852  -->  00:07:23,891
and yeah, it's actually no longer there.
166

166

00:07:23,891  -->  00:07:28,003
If we now check in the projects folder, one level above
167

167

00:07:28,003  -->  00:07:31,843
and check it out, ls, then it's indeed there.
168

168

00:07:31,843  -->  00:07:35,069
So that's the one that we just moved here.
169

169

00:07:35,069  -->  00:07:36,736
Let's clear this up.
170

170

00:07:38,533  -->  00:07:41,273
So I actually already showed you a lot of stuff.
171

171

00:07:41,273  -->  00:07:44,514
Let's just now remove a file, so I'm again
172

172

00:07:44,514  -->  00:07:47,931
going to move into the js folder, so cdjs
173

173

00:07:50,006  -->  00:07:52,571
and since I already copied the index.js file
174

174

00:07:52,571  -->  00:07:54,659
to the project folder so the folder above,
175

175

00:07:54,659  -->  00:07:57,994
let's just delete it and nothing is simple in that,
176

176

00:07:57,994  -->  00:08:02,161
because we simply have to write rm and then index.js.
177

177

00:08:03,623  -->  00:08:06,411
And that's it, and sorry, I forgot to say
178

178

00:08:06,411  -->  00:08:10,636
that in Windows it's called del, del for delete.
179

179

00:08:10,636  -->  00:08:13,776
Is not rm, rm is just on a Mac or on Linnux
180

180

00:08:13,776  -->  00:08:15,938
because it's also running UNIX.
181

181

00:08:15,938  -->  00:08:19,491
Now please be careful with this rm, with this removing,
182

182

00:08:19,491  -->  00:08:21,789
because this doesn't go to the trash bin.
183

183

00:08:21,789  -->  00:08:23,858
No, it's really deleted from your computer.
184

184

00:08:23,858  -->  00:08:28,025
You cannot get it back, so always use this with great care.
185

185

00:08:29,327  -->  00:08:31,768
Let's all look if this actually worked, and yeah.
186

186

00:08:31,768  -->  00:08:35,125
So all that's left here is a test.js.
187

187

00:08:35,125  -->  00:08:38,160
Maybe we also don't need this file anymore,
188

188

00:08:38,160  -->  00:08:40,115
so let's just delete it as well.
189

189

00:08:40,115  -->  00:08:43,304
Or even better, we could to delete the entire folder.
190

190

00:08:43,304  -->  00:08:44,907
Let's try that, okay?
191

191

00:08:44,907  -->  00:08:48,076
Let's go back to the folder, and then rm
192

192

00:08:48,076  -->  00:08:49,993
and then the js folder.
193

193

00:08:51,264  -->  00:08:54,646
This didn't work because js is not a folder
194

194

00:08:54,646  -->  00:08:56,956
so we have to do it in a different way.
195

195

00:08:56,956  -->  00:08:59,389
So how does it work, at least on a Mac?
196

196

00:08:59,389  -->  00:09:01,481
On Windows, I'm actually not pretty sure
197

197

00:09:01,481  -->  00:09:03,366
how it's gonna work but don't worry
198

198

00:09:03,366  -->  00:09:05,615
because it's also not really important.
199

199

00:09:05,615  -->  00:09:08,181
If we move a directory to a folder,
200

200

00:09:08,181  -->  00:09:09,230
it's actually pretty much the same.
201

201

00:09:09,230  -->  00:09:11,616
All you have to do is rm, and then you basically
202

202

00:09:11,616  -->  00:09:15,342
(mumbles) and option, like this, so dash and then r,
203

203

00:09:15,342  -->  00:09:17,638
which stands for recursive, which simply means
204

204

00:09:17,638  -->  00:09:19,408
that it's gonna delete all the files
205

205

00:09:19,408  -->  00:09:20,751
and then also the folder.
206

206

00:09:20,751  -->  00:09:24,069
And now, like this, it's gonna work.
207

207

00:09:24,069  -->  00:09:26,173
So the js folder is now gone,
208

208

00:09:26,173  -->  00:09:28,541
and let's actually confirm it, and yeah,
209

209

00:09:28,541  -->  00:09:33,254
we're back to the index.html and the img folder.
210

210

00:09:33,254  -->  00:09:35,730
Just to clear up all the work that we did,
211

211

00:09:35,730  -->  00:09:38,439
let's also delete these two files here.
212

212

00:09:38,439  -->  00:09:39,984
So now we're back to the initial situation
213

213

00:09:39,984  -->  00:09:41,297
that we started with.
214

214

00:09:41,297  -->  00:09:43,880
rnindex.js, and then script.js.
215

215

00:09:47,277  -->  00:09:50,636
Then again, please be careful before hitting return
216

216

00:09:50,636  -->  00:09:53,619
on this one, because these files, they are gone forever.
217

217

00:09:53,619  -->  00:09:56,192
If you accidentally typed index.html,
218

218

00:09:56,192  -->  00:09:59,659
that index.hml file will be gone forever,
219

219

00:09:59,659  -->  00:10:00,492
you cannot get it back.
220

220

00:10:00,492  -->  00:10:04,169
So please be careful that the file names you wrote here
221

221

00:10:04,169  -->  00:10:05,537
are absolutely correct.
222

222

00:10:05,537  -->  00:10:09,802
Adjust the files you have created and are empty here, okay?
223

223

00:10:09,802  -->  00:10:13,443
In my case, everything's correct so I'll hit return,
224

224

00:10:13,443  -->  00:10:15,358
and now the files are gone.
225

225

00:10:15,358  -->  00:10:17,079
One last thing I want to show you.
226

226

00:10:17,079  -->  00:10:20,555
This one, I'm also not sure if it works in Windows.
227

227

00:10:20,555  -->  00:10:24,562
Let's go into the img folder and now let's simply
228

228

00:10:24,562  -->  00:10:27,789
open one up, these images because here, on the Mac at least,
229

229

00:10:27,789  -->  00:10:32,015
and in UNIX, you can simply write open, for example
230

230

00:10:32,015  -->  00:10:36,162
on .jpg and this then going to open the program
231

231

00:10:36,162  -->  00:10:39,245
in which we usually watch the images.
232

232

00:10:40,954  -->  00:10:41,961
And that's actually it.
233

233

00:10:41,961  -->  00:10:43,738
I think this is enough to actually show you
234

234

00:10:43,738  -->  00:10:45,623
how the command line works.
235

235

00:10:45,623  -->  00:10:47,824
Now what I want you to do to practice this,
236

236

00:10:47,824  -->  00:10:50,621
is to just create a new folder called command line
237

237

00:10:50,621  -->  00:10:52,728
on your desktop, then in there create
238

238

00:10:52,728  -->  00:10:56,161
a couple of folders and then create a couple of files there.
239

239

00:10:56,161  -->  00:10:59,956
Maybe you can also copy it around, or move them around,
240

240

00:10:59,956  -->  00:11:02,780
and do all the kind of stuff that we did here in this video,
241

241

00:11:02,780  -->  00:11:05,841
so that you get some practice and don't forget immediately
242

242

00:11:05,841  -->  00:11:07,050
what we just did here.
243

243

00:11:07,050  -->  00:11:10,410
So, this is enough for this video, this should give you
244

244

00:11:10,410  -->  00:11:12,279
a good enough grasp of the command line
245

245

00:11:12,279  -->  00:11:13,870
so now we're good to go
246

246

00:11:13,870  -->  00:11:16,953
and install SASS in the next lecture.
