1

00:00:01,635  -->  00:00:03,417
<v Instructor>So let's now continue building</v>
2

2

00:00:03,417  -->  00:00:05,084
our animated button.
3

3

00:00:05,980  -->  00:00:08,873
So this is the final page and the final button.
4

4

00:00:08,873  -->  00:00:10,931
And what we're missing here is this white part
5

5

00:00:10,931  -->  00:00:14,072
that looks like it zooms out to infinity when we hover,
6

6

00:00:14,072  -->  00:00:16,136
and it comes back when we hover out.
7

7

00:00:16,136  -->  00:00:16,969
See.
8

8

00:00:16,969  -->  00:00:18,786
So this nice effect.
9

9

00:00:18,786  -->  00:00:21,549
It's not really necessary, of course, to add this.
10

10

00:00:21,549  -->  00:00:24,455
But it was a great opportunity to show you the power
11

11

00:00:24,455  -->  00:00:27,563
of CSS and of pseudo-elements.
12

12

00:00:27,563  -->  00:00:30,230
So let me show you how we do it.
13

13

00:00:31,144  -->  00:00:33,832
So as I said, we're gonna use pseudo-elements.
14

14

00:00:33,832  -->  00:00:35,377
And pseudo-elements allow us
15

15

00:00:35,377  -->  00:00:38,440
to style certain parts of elements.
16

16

00:00:38,440  -->  00:00:40,688
For example, the after pseudo-element that we're
17

17

00:00:40,688  -->  00:00:43,463
gonna use adds like a virtual element
18

18

00:00:43,463  -->  00:00:46,067
right after the element that we're selecting.
19

19

00:00:46,067  -->  00:00:48,253
And we can then style that element.
20

20

00:00:48,253  -->  00:00:50,260
And so using this after pseudo-element
21

21

00:00:50,260  -->  00:00:54,148
can be really powerful to do some cool effects.
22

22

00:00:54,148  -->  00:00:55,426
And once you master it,
23

23

00:00:55,426  -->  00:00:58,103
you're gonna want to use it all the time.
24

24

00:00:58,103  -->  00:00:59,686
So, let me just add
25

25

00:01:01,915  -->  00:01:03,669
the after pseudo-element.
26

26

00:01:03,669  -->  00:01:05,745
So the trick here is to add an element
27

27

00:01:05,745  -->  00:01:08,441
that looks exactly like the button that we already have,
28

28

00:01:08,441  -->  00:01:10,724
but we put it behind the button.
29

29

00:01:10,724  -->  00:01:12,579
And when we hover out of the button,
30

30

00:01:12,579  -->  00:01:14,306
then this hidden pseudo-element
31

31

00:01:14,306  -->  00:01:18,174
amazingly goes back behind the button.
32

32

00:01:18,174  -->  00:01:20,565
So let's see how we can do this.
33

33

00:01:20,565  -->  00:01:23,119
First, in order for an after pseudo-element
34

34

00:01:23,119  -->  00:01:25,272
to actually appear on the page,
35

35

00:01:25,272  -->  00:01:28,072
we need to specify its content property.
36

36

00:01:28,072  -->  00:01:29,888
So that's always necessary.
37

37

00:01:29,888  -->  00:01:31,250
It doesn't matter what the content is.
38

38

00:01:31,250  -->  00:01:33,654
It can even be empty like we're gonna do here,
39

39

00:01:33,654  -->  00:01:34,985
but we have to specify it.
40

40

00:01:34,985  -->  00:01:37,115
Otherwise it's not going to appear.
41

41

00:01:37,115  -->  00:01:39,535
And the same thing with the display property.
42

42

00:01:39,535  -->  00:01:42,108
So we have to specify the display property.
43

43

00:01:42,108  -->  00:01:44,507
And in this case, we're gonna say it's an inline block
44

44

00:01:44,507  -->  00:01:49,019
because the button that we have is also an inline block.
45

45

00:01:49,019  -->  00:01:51,593
And so, again, we want it to be exactly the same.
46

46

00:01:51,593  -->  00:01:53,299
We want it to look the same.
47

47

00:01:53,299  -->  00:01:57,193
So we want to have a height of 100%.
48

48

00:01:57,193  -->  00:02:01,276
And we want to have a width of 100% as well.
49

49

00:02:02,419  -->  00:02:04,873
And this works because the after pseudo-element
50

50

00:02:04,873  -->  00:02:08,233
is basically treated like a child of the button.
51

51

00:02:08,233  -->  00:02:11,242
And so if we say that we want the height to be 100%,
52

52

00:02:11,242  -->  00:02:14,559
that's 100% of the width of the button.
53

53

00:02:14,559  -->  00:02:18,720
And so suppose that the button has 100 pixels
54

54

00:02:18,720  -->  00:02:20,829
of height and 50 pixels of width.
55

55

00:02:20,829  -->  00:02:22,421
And so this after pseudo-element
56

56

00:02:22,421  -->  00:02:26,587
will have the exact same dimensions if we set it to 100%.
57

57

00:02:26,587  -->  00:02:30,936
Now the border rate is, should also be the same.
58

58

00:02:30,936  -->  00:02:31,877
100 pixels.
59

59

00:02:31,877  -->  00:02:33,858
So something really big.
60

60

00:02:33,858  -->  00:02:36,321
And now, we also want it to be white.
61

61

00:02:36,321  -->  00:02:37,770
But in order for it to be white,
62

62

00:02:37,770  -->  00:02:40,890
we actually should make another after pseudo-element
63

63

00:02:40,890  -->  00:02:44,039
but this time for the button, right.
64

64

00:02:44,039  -->  00:02:45,789
So let's put it here.
65

65

00:02:47,284  -->  00:02:48,117
And after.
66

66

00:02:50,180  -->  00:02:52,495
And so background color
67

67

00:02:52,495  -->  00:02:53,828
should be white.
68

68

00:02:55,695  -->  00:02:56,528
Alright.
69

69

00:02:56,528  -->  00:03:00,695
Now let's just see on our page if it actually shows up.
70

70

00:03:02,921  -->  00:03:06,669
So right now it still looks like it's part of our element.
71

71

00:03:06,669  -->  00:03:09,196
And so we should change that.
72

72

00:03:09,196  -->  00:03:10,235
So what we wanna do,
73

73

00:03:10,235  -->  00:03:11,154
remember,
74

74

00:03:11,154  -->  00:03:14,419
is to put it behind our actual button.
75

75

00:03:14,419  -->  00:03:15,993
So how can we do that?
76

76

00:03:15,993  -->  00:03:18,653
And we use absolute positioning.
77

77

00:03:18,653  -->  00:03:20,736
So position and absolute.
78

78

00:03:21,744  -->  00:03:24,951
And then we just say it should be zero from the top
79

79

00:03:24,951  -->  00:03:26,868
and zero from the left.
80

80

00:03:27,758  -->  00:03:30,837
Now remember that this absolute positioning
81

81

00:03:30,837  -->  00:03:32,642
needs to have a reference.
82

82

00:03:32,642  -->  00:03:34,763
And the reference is the first element
83

83

00:03:34,763  -->  00:03:37,349
with the relative position that it can find.
84

84

00:03:37,349  -->  00:03:39,096
Now in this case it would be the header
85

85

00:03:39,096  -->  00:03:41,216
because remember we did that before.
86

86

00:03:41,216  -->  00:03:42,514
But we don't want it to be the header.
87

87

00:03:42,514  -->  00:03:45,078
We want it to be hidden after the button.
88

88

00:03:45,078  -->  00:03:47,053
And so, the reference should be the button.
89

89

00:03:47,053  -->  00:03:48,986
Therefore, what we have to do
90

90

00:03:48,986  -->  00:03:53,153
is to set the position property of the button to relative.
91

91

00:03:54,330  -->  00:03:55,627
Alright.
92

92

00:03:55,627  -->  00:03:59,122
And so now it should be hidden behind the button.
93

93

00:03:59,122  -->  00:04:00,925
Now one more thing that we have to do
94

94

00:04:00,925  -->  00:04:02,528
is to set the z index.
95

95

00:04:02,528  -->  00:04:04,391
And we will put it to minus one.
96

96

00:04:04,391  -->  00:04:07,165
So remember the z index defines the position
97

97

00:04:07,165  -->  00:04:10,546
of the elements if they are one on top of another.
98

98

00:04:10,546  -->  00:04:11,851
And so this one has minus one
99

99

00:04:11,851  -->  00:04:14,080
and so it's definitely behind the button.
100

100

00:04:14,080  -->  00:04:14,913
Now since it's hidden,
101

101

00:04:14,913  -->  00:04:17,188
I cannot really show it to you on the page now.
102

102

00:04:17,188  -->  00:04:20,068
But we're gonna see it in a little bit.
103

103

00:04:20,068  -->  00:04:22,372
So when do we actually want to see it.
104

104

00:04:22,372  -->  00:04:24,743
We want to see it when we hover the button.
105

105

00:04:24,743  -->  00:04:28,737
So what we're gonna do is to write it like this.
106

106

00:04:28,737  -->  00:04:30,560
And this may seem a bit complicated,
107

107

00:04:30,560  -->  00:04:31,982
but it's actually not.
108

108

00:04:31,982  -->  00:04:34,836
So, when we hover the button,
109

109

00:04:34,836  -->  00:04:37,012
then we want some certain styles
110

110

00:04:37,012  -->  00:04:39,429
for the after pseudo-element.
111

111

00:04:41,332  -->  00:04:44,087
So this looks a bit weird but it makes total sense.
112

112

00:04:44,087  -->  00:04:46,573
So this is an after pseudo-element
113

113

00:04:46,573  -->  00:04:50,413
only when we have the button on the hover state.
114

114

00:04:50,413  -->  00:04:53,267
And what do we want to happen?
115

115

00:04:53,267  -->  00:04:54,398
We want it to be bigger.
116

116

00:04:54,398  -->  00:04:55,964
Right. Remember.
117

117

00:04:55,964  -->  00:04:58,487
We want the element to grow and to fade out.
118

118

00:04:58,487  -->  00:05:03,056
And so, what we first do is to use once again,
119

119

00:05:03,056  -->  00:05:04,133
the transform property.
120

120

00:05:04,133  -->  00:05:06,955
And I told you it was really important and,
121

121

00:05:06,955  -->  00:05:08,288
so yeah, it is.
122

122

00:05:08,288  -->  00:05:09,864
This time we do a scale.
123

123

00:05:09,864  -->  00:05:11,572
So what scale does is to simply
124

124

00:05:11,572  -->  00:05:13,410
increase the element.
125

125

00:05:13,410  -->  00:05:15,114
So if we do scale two,
126

126

00:05:15,114  -->  00:05:18,851
then it will appear double the size that it had before.
127

127

00:05:18,851  -->  00:05:23,293
So now we can actually check if it's working alright.
128

128

00:05:23,293  -->  00:05:24,311
So reload.
129

129

00:05:24,311  -->  00:05:25,309
And, whoa.
130

130

00:05:25,309  -->  00:05:26,164
There it is.
131

131

00:05:26,164  -->  00:05:27,874
So this white part that you see
132

132

00:05:27,874  -->  00:05:30,705
outside here is the pseudo-element
133

133

00:05:30,705  -->  00:05:33,800
that becomes visible as soon as we hover over the button.
134

134

00:05:33,800  -->  00:05:38,240
Let's actually make it a different color here,
135

135

00:05:38,240  -->  00:05:39,073
like red,
136

136

00:05:39,073  -->  00:05:42,637
just so that you can see the difference.
137

137

00:05:42,637  -->  00:05:43,470
And whoa.
138

138

00:05:43,470  -->  00:05:45,498
Now it's everything red.
139

139

00:05:45,498  -->  00:05:47,163
But that's not a problem.
140

140

00:05:47,163  -->  00:05:49,837
For some reason the original button is also getting red.
141

141

00:05:49,837  -->  00:05:52,660
But we still can be sure the pseudo-element is behind
142

142

00:05:52,660  -->  00:05:55,041
the button because we still can see the text.
143

143

00:05:55,041  -->  00:05:57,826
And so that means that the original button
144

144

00:05:57,826  -->  00:06:00,993
is still on top of the pseudo-element.
145

145

00:06:02,375  -->  00:06:05,792
Let's put it back to white, where it was.
146

146

00:06:07,790  -->  00:06:10,333
And we don't want to scale it this much.
147

147

00:06:10,333  -->  00:06:13,083
So let's just say one point five.
148

148

00:06:14,289  -->  00:06:17,149
And we also want this to be animated just like before.
149

149

00:06:17,149  -->  00:06:19,908
So where do we have to put the transition property?
150

150

00:06:19,908  -->  00:06:20,741
Exactly.
151

151

00:06:20,741  -->  00:06:22,392
We do it on the initial state.
152

152

00:06:22,392  -->  00:06:25,062
In this case the initial state is of course
153

153

00:06:25,062  -->  00:06:27,904
this after pseudo-element.
154

154

00:06:27,904  -->  00:06:28,737
So we say
155

155

00:06:30,657  -->  00:06:31,574
transition,
156

156

00:06:32,954  -->  00:06:35,045
and again I'm going to use all here,
157

157

00:06:35,045  -->  00:06:39,212
and then use, let's say, point four seconds in this case.
158

158

00:06:41,545  -->  00:06:43,168
So here we had point two,
159

159

00:06:43,168  -->  00:06:47,574
but we want this one to take a little bit longer.
160

160

00:06:47,574  -->  00:06:48,783
Now what also happens,
161

161

00:06:48,783  -->  00:06:51,522
is that the element actually fades out.
162

162

00:06:51,522  -->  00:06:52,911
So opacity zero.
163

163

00:06:52,911  -->  00:06:55,043
That's the trick for fading something out,
164

164

00:06:55,043  -->  00:06:57,241
is going to opacity zero.
165

165

00:06:57,241  -->  00:06:58,930
We did that before in our other animation
166

166

00:06:58,930  -->  00:07:00,351
in the lecture before,
167

167

00:07:00,351  -->  00:07:02,558
and so here we're doing it again.
168

168

00:07:02,558  -->  00:07:06,150
So opacity zero sets something to invisible basically.
169

169

00:07:06,150  -->  00:07:07,342
So let's check out
170

170

00:07:07,342  -->  00:07:09,009
if it works already.
171

171

00:07:09,941  -->  00:07:11,248
Yeah, that's actually it.
172

172

00:07:11,248  -->  00:07:13,231
It's already working, right?
173

173

00:07:13,231  -->  00:07:14,388
It comes back.
174

174

00:07:14,388  -->  00:07:16,297
It goes out and it comes back.
175

175

00:07:16,297  -->  00:07:18,139
So, really cool, right?
176

176

00:07:18,139  -->  00:07:20,173
Now we can make this a a little bit better
177

177

00:07:20,173  -->  00:07:23,247
because if you look closely at the top of the button,
178

178

00:07:23,247  -->  00:07:25,138
and you see that it looks really small.
179

179

00:07:25,138  -->  00:07:27,529
So the part that's fading out is like really small.
180

180

00:07:27,529  -->  00:07:28,587
Take a look.
181

181

00:07:28,587  -->  00:07:30,850
So let's do this a bit better.
182

182

00:07:30,850  -->  00:07:32,099
And actually with this I can show you
183

183

00:07:32,099  -->  00:07:33,568
that there are different scales.
184

184

00:07:33,568  -->  00:07:36,639
So scale, without any epsilon here,
185

185

00:07:36,639  -->  00:07:38,493
simply scales the entire element.
186

186

00:07:38,493  -->  00:07:40,806
But we can do scale x,
187

187

00:07:40,806  -->  00:07:43,925
and then that's how it's gonna scale on the x direction.
188

188

00:07:43,925  -->  00:07:45,567
On the x axis.
189

189

00:07:45,567  -->  00:07:48,898
And here we want to do one point four.
190

190

00:07:48,898  -->  00:07:52,407
And now scale, epsilon as you can imagine,
191

191

00:07:52,407  -->  00:07:53,405
in the other direction.
192

192

00:07:53,405  -->  00:07:56,549
So let's put one point six here.
193

193

00:07:56,549  -->  00:07:57,989
So they are different scales.
194

194

00:07:57,989  -->  00:08:00,322
Just like they are different translates,
195

195

00:08:00,322  -->  00:08:03,299
or rotates, or other functions that we can put
196

196

00:08:03,299  -->  00:08:04,943
here in the transform.
197

197

00:08:04,943  -->  00:08:06,860
So, let's check it out.
198

198

00:08:08,742  -->  00:08:09,575
And, yeah.
199

199

00:08:09,575  -->  00:08:11,992
So now it looks a bit better.
200

200

00:08:13,015  -->  00:08:14,360
So, really cool.
201

201

00:08:14,360  -->  00:08:16,203
There's just one thing left here because,
202

202

00:08:16,203  -->  00:08:20,370
take a look here what happens when we load the page.
203

203

00:08:21,220  -->  00:08:22,402
You saw this.
204

204

00:08:22,402  -->  00:08:24,477
This came up moving from the bottom.
205

205

00:08:24,477  -->  00:08:26,926
So first, we saw these two elements coming in,
206

206

00:08:26,926  -->  00:08:28,702
like we coded before.
207

207

00:08:28,702  -->  00:08:30,286
And then the button came up
208

208

00:08:30,286  -->  00:08:32,671
from the bottom to this position.
209

209

00:08:32,671  -->  00:08:34,369
So let's very quickly code up
210

210

00:08:34,369  -->  00:08:36,079
another animation for that.
211

211

00:08:36,079  -->  00:08:38,963
And we're gonna put it here after this one.
212

212

00:08:38,963  -->  00:08:40,907
Actually I'm gonna copy it
213

213

00:08:40,907  -->  00:08:43,157
'cause it's pretty similar.
214

214

00:08:44,645  -->  00:08:45,562
So move in,
215

215

00:08:46,964  -->  00:08:49,032
let's say bottom now,
216

216

00:08:49,032  -->  00:08:50,070
from the bottom.
217

217

00:08:50,070  -->  00:08:51,789
This time we don't need any 80%
218

218

00:08:51,789  -->  00:08:54,303
because it's just from one point to the other.
219

219

00:08:54,303  -->  00:08:56,926
And now I'm going to leave it to you to specify,
220

220

00:08:56,926  -->  00:08:58,019
let's see,
221

221

00:08:58,019  -->  00:08:59,661
what we should put here.
222

222

00:08:59,661  -->  00:09:00,536
So pause the video,
223

223

00:09:00,536  -->  00:09:04,536
and try to figure out how this should look like.
224

224

00:09:05,929  -->  00:09:07,463
So, did you figure it out?
225

225

00:09:07,463  -->  00:09:10,355
How should the button be positioned
226

226

00:09:10,355  -->  00:09:13,368
right in the beginning before the animation starts?
227

227

00:09:13,368  -->  00:09:16,247
It should be a bit lower than its current position, right?
228

228

00:09:16,247  -->  00:09:17,947
Because it's moving in from the bottom
229

229

00:09:17,947  -->  00:09:20,155
to its original position.
230

230

00:09:20,155  -->  00:09:24,693
And so we can do translate epsilon this time.
231

231

00:09:24,693  -->  00:09:27,900
And put something like 30 pixels in here.
232

232

00:09:27,900  -->  00:09:29,308
That's because remember,
233

233

00:09:29,308  -->  00:09:31,321
for the epsilon direction
234

234

00:09:31,321  -->  00:09:32,425
it goes like this.
235

235

00:09:32,425  -->  00:09:33,660
So from top to bottom.
236

236

00:09:33,660  -->  00:09:37,108
So if we want to move it down, it's a positive value.
237

237

00:09:37,108  -->  00:09:37,941
Alright.
238

238

00:09:37,941  -->  00:09:40,364
And let's now actually use this animation.
239

239

00:09:40,364  -->  00:09:44,114
Now again there will be multiple buttons like this.
240

240

00:09:44,114  -->  00:09:45,798
But I only want this animation to happen
241

241

00:09:45,798  -->  00:09:47,615
on this particular button.
242

242

00:09:47,615  -->  00:09:48,486
And so what I'm gonna do
243

243

00:09:48,486  -->  00:09:51,736
is to create a new class on the button.
244

244

00:09:53,997  -->  00:09:54,830
So button,
245

245

00:09:55,832  -->  00:09:56,988
animated.
246

246

00:09:56,988  -->  00:09:58,930
And only this button will have this class.
247

247

00:09:58,930  -->  00:10:00,175
Okay?
248

248

00:10:00,175  -->  00:10:01,961
So let's put it here.
249

249

00:10:01,961  -->  00:10:02,794
Button.
250

250

00:10:03,996  -->  00:10:05,091
Animated.
251

251

00:10:05,091  -->  00:10:07,808
And then in here I will put the animation.
252

252

00:10:07,808  -->  00:10:08,915
So animation,
253

253

00:10:08,915  -->  00:10:10,734
and I'm going to use the shorten property
254

254

00:10:10,734  -->  00:10:12,348
that I showed you before.
255

255

00:10:12,348  -->  00:10:15,265
And now it's called move in bottom.
256

256

00:10:16,419  -->  00:10:20,518
And let's use point five, second animation.
257

257

00:10:20,518  -->  00:10:24,166
And we're gonna use an ease out this time.
258

258

00:10:24,166  -->  00:10:25,157
Okay?
259

259

00:10:25,157  -->  00:10:28,245
Now plus what we're gonna do is to have a delay.
260

260

00:10:28,245  -->  00:10:30,886
So we don't want to start it at the same time as the others.
261

261

00:10:30,886  -->  00:10:33,016
We want it to start slightly later.
262

262

00:10:33,016  -->  00:10:34,563
So maybe not one entire second,
263

263

00:10:34,563  -->  00:10:37,471
which is the animation time of the other two animations,
264

264

00:10:37,471  -->  00:10:40,217
but maybe just 75% of that.
265

265

00:10:40,217  -->  00:10:41,467
So .75 seconds.
266

266

00:10:43,112  -->  00:10:45,203
So I told you that we could put all of
267

267

00:10:45,203  -->  00:10:47,497
these values in the same animation property.
268

268

00:10:47,497  -->  00:10:50,109
So this is the animation name, the animation duration,
269

269

00:10:50,109  -->  00:10:51,952
the animation timing function,
270

270

00:10:51,952  -->  00:10:54,264
and the animation delay.
271

271

00:10:54,264  -->  00:10:57,764
So let's take a look at what happens here.
272

272

00:11:01,993  -->  00:11:03,288
Alright, so you saw that.
273

273

00:11:03,288  -->  00:11:05,181
Actually the button was visible
274

274

00:11:05,181  -->  00:11:07,286
before the animation happened.
275

275

00:11:07,286  -->  00:11:09,134
Let's take a look again.
276

276

00:11:09,134  -->  00:11:12,083
So it stays visible and then it starts.
277

277

00:11:12,083  -->  00:11:15,029
Now what could we do in order to prevent this.
278

278

00:11:15,029  -->  00:11:18,955
We could simply put these initial states on the button.
279

279

00:11:18,955  -->  00:11:21,222
But that would be highly impractical, right?
280

280

00:11:21,222  -->  00:11:22,873
Wouldn't make much sense.
281

281

00:11:22,873  -->  00:11:26,433
So there is another property related to animations.
282

282

00:11:26,433  -->  00:11:30,034
And this one is called animation fill mode
283

283

00:11:30,034  -->  00:11:31,951
So animation fill mode.
284

284

00:11:32,962  -->  00:11:35,879
And now we can set it to backwards.
285

285

00:11:37,160  -->  00:11:38,511
And what this does,
286

286

00:11:38,511  -->  00:11:40,373
is that it will automatically apply
287

287

00:11:40,373  -->  00:11:45,044
the styles up to zero percent before the animation starts.
288

288

00:11:45,044  -->  00:11:48,438
So, again, these styles will now be applied
289

289

00:11:48,438  -->  00:11:50,731
before the animation starts simply by using the
290

290

00:11:50,731  -->  00:11:54,942
animation fill mode and set it to backwards.
291

291

00:11:54,942  -->  00:11:56,128
So, pretty amazing right?
292

292

00:11:56,128  -->  00:11:59,280
So it's really simple, simple solution to this problem.
293

293

00:11:59,280  -->  00:12:01,487
And so let's try it again.
294

294

00:12:01,487  -->  00:12:03,928
And, yeah, so here it works.
295

295

00:12:03,928  -->  00:12:04,761
Alright.
296

296

00:12:04,761  -->  00:12:05,978
And that's it for this lecture,
297

297

00:12:05,978  -->  00:12:08,213
and actually for this section.
298

298

00:12:08,213  -->  00:12:10,089
So, we've come a long way so far,
299

299

00:12:10,089  -->  00:12:13,205
and we already coded a bunch of really cool stuff I think.
300

300

00:12:13,205  -->  00:12:16,184
We already have the header already completed.
301

301

00:12:16,184  -->  00:12:17,805
Only what's missing here is this navigation
302

302

00:12:17,805  -->  00:12:19,272
but it's a bit too complex for now,
303

303

00:12:19,272  -->  00:12:22,384
so we're gonna leave it for another time.
304

304

00:12:22,384  -->  00:12:24,937
But for now, we've come far enough with this project
305

305

00:12:24,937  -->  00:12:27,347
that it's now time to show you a little bit of
306

306

00:12:27,347  -->  00:12:29,872
how CSS actually works behind the scenes.
307

307

00:12:29,872  -->  00:12:31,695
So I have a couple of really great lectures
308

308

00:12:31,695  -->  00:12:34,671
coming up which I spent a lot of time building for you.
309

309

00:12:34,671  -->  00:12:37,054
But they will be really insightful and helpful,
310

310

00:12:37,054  -->  00:12:37,965
I hope.
311

311

00:12:37,965  -->  00:12:38,798
So,
312

312

00:12:38,798  -->  00:12:41,144
review what we just did in this section maybe.
313

313

00:12:41,144  -->  00:12:44,549
Or you can just move on to the next one right now.
314

314

00:12:44,549  -->  00:12:46,716
Anyway, see you next time.
