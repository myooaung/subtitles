00:00:01.747  -->  00:00:04.581
<v Jonas>Let's now define the column tracks of our layout,</v>
2

2

00:00:04.581  -->  00:00:07.442
and then place the grid items in it,
3

3

00:00:07.442  -->  00:00:11.050
so that we end up with our final design.
4

4

00:00:11.050  -->  00:00:14.724
So let's now think about the column tracks of this design.
5

5

00:00:14.724  -->  00:00:17.715
So it's very common in web design to use a design grid,
6

6

00:00:17.715  -->  00:00:21.632
with like eight or 12 or 16 predefined columns.
7

7

00:00:23.109  -->  00:00:25.304
And so that's also what we're gonna do in here.
8

8

00:00:25.304  -->  00:00:27.978
Now it may not really be necessary for this design,
9

9

00:00:27.978  -->  00:00:31.005
but as I mentioned, grid systems like this one
10

10

00:00:31.005  -->  00:00:34.257
are widely used in web design.
11

11

00:00:34.257  -->  00:00:37.517
So, for example, Bootstrap has a 12 column grid.
12

12

00:00:37.517  -->  00:00:39.627
And many other design systems out there
13

13

00:00:39.627  -->  00:00:41.470
work the exact same way.
14

14

00:00:41.470  -->  00:00:43.230
And so that's why I wanted to teach you here
15

15

00:00:43.230  -->  00:00:45.493
how we can use that as well.
16

16

00:00:45.493  -->  00:00:47.727
So we start with an eight column grid here,
17

17

00:00:47.727  -->  00:00:49.290
so something very simple.
18

18

00:00:49.290  -->  00:00:51.184
And then I'm gonna keep adding some stuff,
19

19

00:00:51.184  -->  00:00:52.716
but we're gonna build it step by step
20

20

00:00:52.716  -->  00:00:54.851
so it makes all the sense to you.
21

21

00:00:54.851  -->  00:00:58.441
So let's start with the eight column layout.
22

22

00:00:58.441  -->  00:01:00.699
Imagine that we wanted just a very, very simple
23

23

00:01:00.699  -->  00:01:02.353
eight column layout.
24

24

00:01:02.353  -->  00:01:06.520
All we have to do is to say grid-template-columns,
25

25

00:01:08.086  -->  00:01:11.419
and then repeat eight and one fr, right.
26

26

00:01:12.274  -->  00:01:15.785
So this would produce eight equally sized columns
27

27

00:01:15.785  -->  00:01:18.192
occupying the entire viewport.
28

28

00:01:18.192  -->  00:01:22.330
And that's exactly what it would look like.
29

29

00:01:22.330  -->  00:01:24.644
So the first row here, remember,
30

30

00:01:24.644  -->  00:01:26.856
has 80% of the viewport height.
31

31

00:01:26.856  -->  00:01:30.572
And so our nine grid items would fill these eight columns
32

32

00:01:30.572  -->  00:01:33.388
in here and then add another item down here
33

33

00:01:33.388  -->  00:01:34.804
in the second row.
34

34

00:01:34.804  -->  00:01:36.352
But that's not quite what we want,
35

35

00:01:36.352  -->  00:01:38.852
because what we want is actually to have
36

36

00:01:38.852  -->  00:01:43.003
like this fixed here in the middle of the viewport, right.
37

37

00:01:43.003  -->  00:01:44.976
So we want like, for example, in here,
38

38

00:01:44.976  -->  00:01:47.968
we want this here to have always the same width
39

39

00:01:47.968  -->  00:01:49.799
this entire part, right.
40

40

00:01:49.799  -->  00:01:53.062
So we have this here, and then centered nicely
41

41

00:01:53.062  -->  00:01:56.307
in the viewport, like we're used to having it.
42

42

00:01:56.307  -->  00:01:59.038
And so what that means is that these columns in the middle,
43

43

00:01:59.038  -->  00:02:01.265
they have actually a fixed width.
44

44

00:02:01.265  -->  00:02:04.630
And let me actually show you the grid inspector here,
45

45

00:02:04.630  -->  00:02:08.954
so that it makes it a bit easier to understand.
46

46

00:02:08.954  -->  00:02:11.951
Okay, and you see that these are the eight columns
47

47

00:02:11.951  -->  00:02:13.632
that I was talking about.
48

48

00:02:13.632  -->  00:02:15.973
So one, two, three, four, five,
49

49

00:02:15.973  -->  00:02:17.806
six, seven, and eight.
50

50

00:02:19.138  -->  00:02:21.144
So these are our main eight columns.
51

51

00:02:21.144  -->  00:02:25.311
So we want them to have a, like a fixed width, right.
52

52

00:02:26.549  -->  00:02:28.087
So let's do that.
53

53

00:02:28.087  -->  00:02:32.620
And remember that usually we use something like 1140 pixels
54

54

00:02:32.620  -->  00:02:36.039
or 1200, so something between 1100 and 1200
55

55

00:02:36.039  -->  00:02:37.791
I think would be reasonable.
56

56

00:02:37.791  -->  00:02:40.624
And so let's divide 1140 by eight,
57

57

00:02:42.229  -->  00:02:45.652
that is approximately 142 pixels.
58

58

00:02:45.652  -->  00:02:48.587
So let's simply say that it's 140 pixels
59

59

00:02:48.587  -->  00:02:50.170
and make it 14 rem.
60

60

00:02:51.215  -->  00:02:55.382
Because remember, 14 rem translates to 140 pixels.
61

61

00:02:56.581  -->  00:02:59.344
So let's take a look at that now.
62

62

00:02:59.344  -->  00:03:01.163
And so that's what it looks like.
63

63

00:03:01.163  -->  00:03:04.332
But now suppose that we decrease our viewport,
64

64

00:03:04.332  -->  00:03:07.082
and it doesn't even adapt at all.
65

65

00:03:08.453  -->  00:03:10.166
And that makes total sense, because this is just
66

66

00:03:10.166  -->  00:03:12.556
a fixed-width columns.
67

67

00:03:12.556  -->  00:03:14.806
And so I already showed you in the last section
68

68

00:03:14.806  -->  00:03:16.473
how we can fix that.
69

69

00:03:17.907  -->  00:03:22.074
And so what we're gonna use here is the minmax function.
70

70

00:03:23.786  -->  00:03:27.506
So we say it that the maximum should be 14 rem,
71

71

00:03:27.506  -->  00:03:28.797
but it can be lower.
72

72

00:03:28.797  -->  00:03:31.464
But never below the min content.
73

73

00:03:32.298  -->  00:03:35.973
So the minimum size that it should have in order to fit
74

74

00:03:35.973  -->  00:03:37.543
the content in there.
75

75

00:03:37.543  -->  00:03:39.080
So let's think about it again.
76

76

00:03:39.080  -->  00:03:41.701
So we want to have eight columns, and we want the width
77

77

00:03:41.701  -->  00:03:45.316
of each of these columns to be between their minimum content
78

78

00:03:45.316  -->  00:03:46.566
and 140 pixels.
79

79

00:03:49.223  -->  00:03:51.973
So let's take a look at that now.
80

80

00:03:53.073  -->  00:03:54.511
And here we go.
81

81

00:03:54.511  -->  00:03:56.845
So now it actually is starting to adapt
82

82

00:03:56.845  -->  00:03:59.507
to the viewport width.
83

83

00:03:59.507  -->  00:04:04.346
But also it never grows larger than these 140 pixels
84

84

00:04:04.346  -->  00:04:06.905
for each of the columns.
85

85

00:04:06.905  -->  00:04:09.953
So that's kind of what we want already.
86

86

00:04:09.953  -->  00:04:13.765
Also, we want something else, and that's this sidebar here.
87

87

00:04:13.765  -->  00:04:15.467
So you see that we have these eight columns here
88

88

00:04:15.467  -->  00:04:17.414
in the middle, but the on the left side we have
89

89

00:04:17.414  -->  00:04:18.964
the sidebar.
90

90

00:04:18.964  -->  00:04:21.681
And so that's also a column track.
91

91

00:04:21.681  -->  00:04:24.264
So let's add that here as well.
92

92

00:04:25.137  -->  00:04:29.083
And we want it to be 80 pixels wide, so eight rem.
93

93

00:04:29.083  -->  00:04:31.586
So just like that, we added another column.
94

94

00:04:31.586  -->  00:04:34.103
So right now we have eight rem for the sidebar,
95

95

00:04:34.103  -->  00:04:37.254
then our 14 rem columns beside that.
96

96

00:04:37.254  -->  00:04:39.835
So let's take a look at that again.
97

97

00:04:39.835  -->  00:04:42.346
And so here, here you have the sidebar.
98

98

00:04:42.346  -->  00:04:45.351
And so now the last step is to actually, basically center
99

99

00:04:45.351  -->  00:04:48.906
these eight columns between this end of the viewport
100

100

00:04:48.906  -->  00:04:51.024
and this sidebar.
101

101

00:04:51.024  -->  00:04:54.013
Because we don't actually want this to be centered
102

102

00:04:54.013  -->  00:04:58.347
in the viewport, but let's say, between the sidebar
103

103

00:04:58.347  -->  00:05:00.631
and the end of the page.
104

104

00:05:00.631  -->  00:05:02.398
And so how can we do that?
105

105

00:05:02.398  -->  00:05:04.413
What do you think would be the best way to achieve
106

106

00:05:04.413  -->  00:05:05.916
exactly that?
107

107

00:05:05.916  -->  00:05:08.677
Well, we could simply add two more columns,
108

108

00:05:08.677  -->  00:05:12.389
one to each side of these eight columns here in the middle.
109

109

00:05:12.389  -->  00:05:15.447
So one here on the left side, so let's say here,
110

110

00:05:15.447  -->  00:05:17.256
and then one here on the right side.
111

111

00:05:17.256  -->  00:05:19.197
And we want both of them to occupy
112

112

00:05:19.197  -->  00:05:21.447
the remaining of the space.
113

113

00:05:22.891  -->  00:05:23.897
Does that make sense?
114

114

00:05:23.897  -->  00:05:26.093
So what I just said translate into
115

115

00:05:26.093  -->  00:05:28.426
one fractional unit in here,
116

116

00:05:30.012  -->  00:05:32.502
and one fractional unit at the end.
117

117

00:05:32.502  -->  00:05:34.521
So I hope that makes sense as well.
118

118

00:05:34.521  -->  00:05:37.445
So let's check it out, and here we go.
119

119

00:05:37.445  -->  00:05:41.528
So let's actually use our grid tool here as well.
120

120

00:05:43.393  -->  00:05:44.402
And so here we go.
121

121

00:05:44.402  -->  00:05:46.523
Let's see it down here as well.
122

122

00:05:46.523  -->  00:05:48.024
And so this is what I was saying.
123

123

00:05:48.024  -->  00:05:50.583
So we have our eight grids here in the middle,
124

124

00:05:50.583  -->  00:05:52.331
the eight columns actually,
125

125

00:05:52.331  -->  00:05:55.372
and then here on the right side and on the left side,
126

126

00:05:55.372  -->  00:05:58.430
we have the one that occupied the remaining space.
127

127

00:05:58.430  -->  00:06:01.342
So if we now decrease this viewport,
128

128

00:06:01.342  -->  00:06:02.890
you will see that these ones
129

129

00:06:02.890  -->  00:06:06.205
are the ones that start to shrink first.
130

130

00:06:06.205  -->  00:06:09.122
So this last one and this one here.
131

131

00:06:10.061  -->  00:06:12.616
So they started to shrink because the are the one
132

132

00:06:12.616  -->  00:06:16.783
that occupy the fractional space, the remaining space.
133

133

00:06:19.052  -->  00:06:21.501
And so that is kind of what we wanted,
134

134

00:06:21.501  -->  00:06:25.347
having our eight columns centered right in the viewport.
135

135

00:06:25.347  -->  00:06:28.442
Now if we hadn't this sidebar here, then you could've used
136

136

00:06:28.442  -->  00:06:30.859
the margin: auto, zero trick.
137

137

00:06:32.048  -->  00:06:34.051
So where the margin on the left and on the right side
138

138

00:06:34.051  -->  00:06:38.342
are set to auto, and then that would center the element,
139

139

00:06:38.342  -->  00:06:40.675
or all of these items, in the viewport.
140

140

00:06:40.675  -->  00:06:42.360
Or we could also have used, of course,
141

141

00:06:42.360  -->  00:06:43.884
the justify content property,
142

142

00:06:43.884  -->  00:06:47.310
but that wouldn't have been perfect in this case as well.
143

143

00:06:47.310  -->  00:06:50.623
And actually another reason why we want to do it like this
144

144

00:06:50.623  -->  00:06:52.698
is what I'm gonna show you here,
145

145

00:06:52.698  -->  00:06:55.873
and that's these sections here that go from one side
146

146

00:06:55.873  -->  00:06:56.763
to the other.
147

147

00:06:56.763  -->  00:06:59.396
And so that's what I call the full-bleed sections.
148

148

00:06:59.396  -->  00:07:02.320
So you see that in here, for example, here on the top,
149

149

00:07:02.320  -->  00:07:05.875
we have this here occupying only our eight columns
150

150

00:07:05.875  -->  00:07:06.863
in the middle.
151

151

00:07:06.863  -->  00:07:08.165
But if you then move down here,
152

152

00:07:08.165  -->  00:07:10.636
you see that this full-bleed section actually goes
153

153

00:07:10.636  -->  00:07:13.503
all the way from this side, here to the right side
154

154

00:07:13.503  -->  00:07:14.817
of the viewport.
155

155

00:07:14.817  -->  00:07:17.081
And the same thing you can see here in the gallery,
156

156

00:07:17.081  -->  00:07:19.178
and actually even in the footer.
157

157

00:07:19.178  -->  00:07:21.928
And also the header and top here.
158

158

00:07:22.848  -->  00:07:24.248
And so these are the full-bleed sections,
159

159

00:07:24.248  -->  00:07:27.841
and we then need these columns here on the left side
160

160

00:07:27.841  -->  00:07:29.499
and on the right side to basically
161

161

00:07:29.499  -->  00:07:33.313
break out of our predefined eight column grid
162

162

00:07:33.313  -->  00:07:35.478
that we have in the middle of the page.
163

163

00:07:35.478  -->  00:07:38.648
And so that's another thing that this layout here
164

164

00:07:38.648  -->  00:07:40.411
allows us to do perfectly.
165

165

00:07:40.411  -->  00:07:42.607
So this is perfect for having full-bleed sections
166

166

00:07:42.607  -->  00:07:46.164
in the middle of some eight column sections.
167

167

00:07:46.164  -->  00:07:48.104
And actually this is a trend that we've been seeing
168

168

00:07:48.104  -->  00:07:49.824
more and more in web design,
169

169

00:07:49.824  -->  00:07:51.989
which is having exactly that, what I just said.
170

170

00:07:51.989  -->  00:07:55.137
So having a couple of design elements
171

171

00:07:55.137  -->  00:07:57.597
which are centered in the viewport like we have here
172

172

00:07:57.597  -->  00:07:58.744
with this eight columns,
173

173

00:07:58.744  -->  00:08:01.082
but then sometimes we have some full-bleed sections
174

174

00:08:01.082  -->  00:08:02.948
in the middle of that.
175

175

00:08:02.948  -->  00:08:05.970
And so grid layout is perfect for doing exactly that
176

176

00:08:05.970  -->  00:08:07.721
in a simple way.
177

177

00:08:07.721  -->  00:08:10.849
So the first time that we actually set this up,
178

178

00:08:10.849  -->  00:08:12.932
it's maybe not so simple,
179

179

00:08:12.932  -->  00:08:16.824
but I hope that you understood the logic behind of this.
180

180

00:08:16.824  -->  00:08:20.258
So again, we started with an eight column layout
181

181

00:08:20.258  -->  00:08:22.229
that are these eight columns here,
182

182

00:08:22.229  -->  00:08:25.278
then on the left side we added this sidebar,
183

183

00:08:25.278  -->  00:08:28.108
and then we added this column here on the left side
184

184

00:08:28.108  -->  00:08:31.337
and on the right side, which both occupy the remaining,
185

185

00:08:31.337  -->  00:08:32.884
so the fractional space,
186

186

00:08:32.884  -->  00:08:34.911
in order to center these eight columns
187

187

00:08:34.911  -->  00:08:37.450
in the middle of the page.
188

188

00:08:37.450  -->  00:08:39.555
And if you then want a full-bleed section,
189

189

00:08:39.555  -->  00:08:42.099
we can occupy these contents here
190

190

00:08:42.099  -->  00:08:44.906
and have a section that goes all the way from the left side
191

191

00:08:44.906  -->  00:08:46.702
to the right side, for example.
192

192

00:08:46.702  -->  00:08:48.279
And with that, we can kind of break
193

193

00:08:48.279  -->  00:08:51.070
the inner eight column layout.
194

194

00:08:51.070  -->  00:08:54.096
So I hope that does a lot of sense to you.
195

195

00:08:54.096  -->  00:08:55.981
Now in order to make our life a bit easier
196

196

00:08:55.981  -->  00:08:57.545
when we start placing the items,
197

197

00:08:57.545  -->  00:09:00.629
let's actually name these column tracks here.
198

198

00:09:00.629  -->  00:09:02.810
And so we already talked about it in our last section,
199

199

00:09:02.810  -->  00:09:06.977
and so I'm gonna name this one here the sidebar-start,
200

200

00:09:12.662  -->  00:09:14.093
and the sidebar-end.
201

201

00:09:14.093  -->  00:09:16.959
And then remember that the grid line can have multiple names
202

202

00:09:16.959  -->  00:09:21.126
and so this one will be also called the full-start,
203

203

00:09:22.320  -->  00:09:24.616
because basically this is where we want to start
204

204

00:09:24.616  -->  00:09:26.667
the full-bleed sections.
205

205

00:09:26.667  -->  00:09:29.165
So imagine that we have a full-bleed section,
206

206

00:09:29.165  -->  00:09:31.333
like I explained before, then that would start
207

207

00:09:31.333  -->  00:09:33.784
right here after the sidebar
208

208

00:09:33.784  -->  00:09:36.774
and would go all the way until the end.
209

209

00:09:36.774  -->  00:09:40.546
So let me name the last grid line here as well,
210

210

00:09:40.546  -->  00:09:41.546
so full-end.
211

211

00:09:44.204  -->  00:09:46.358
Now the grid line that comes after this one here
212

212

00:09:46.358  -->  00:09:49.275
I'm gonna call it the center-start,
213

213

00:09:52.159  -->  00:09:56.160
because this is basically the beginning of our eight columns
214

214

00:09:56.160  -->  00:09:57.172
and so that's the part
215

215

00:09:57.172  -->  00:09:58.919
that's gonna stay centered in the middle.
216

216

00:09:58.919  -->  00:10:01.041
And so this one is called the center,
217

217

00:10:01.041  -->  00:10:03.005
so I'm gonna call this one center-start,
218

218

00:10:03.005  -->  00:10:07.172
and then the grid line after this, the center-end.
219

219

00:10:10.595  -->  00:10:14.272
And now finally we also want to name all of these columns,
220

220

00:10:14.272  -->  00:10:17.796
and so we can do that, and we did it before actually,
221

221

00:10:17.796  -->  00:10:20.724
and so we create a set of named lines.
222

222

00:10:20.724  -->  00:10:23.184
So we do it in the repeat here,
223

223

00:10:23.184  -->  00:10:28.038
and then this one is called, simply called start,
224

224

00:10:28.038  -->  00:10:30.788
and then after, it is called end.
225

225

00:10:32.582  -->  00:10:34.341
And remember that this is then going to create
226

226

00:10:34.341  -->  00:10:37.404
eight col-starts, starting from number one
227

227

00:10:37.404  -->  00:10:38.637
to number eight.
228

228

00:10:38.637  -->  00:10:40.052
So we're gonna have col-start one, two, three,
229

229

00:10:40.052  -->  00:10:44.219
all the way to eight, and the same thing for col-end.
230

230

00:10:45.409  -->  00:10:47.386
Now before all of this starts confusing you,
231

231

00:10:47.386  -->  00:10:50.641
let's actually use this in practice right now.
232

232

00:10:50.641  -->  00:10:54.600
So let's start by placing the sidebar.
233

233

00:10:54.600  -->  00:10:56.350
And so let's open it,
234

234

00:10:57.833  -->  00:10:59.516
and we want the sidebar to start
235

235

00:10:59.516  -->  00:11:03.683
from the grid line called sidebar-start to sidebar-end.
236

236

00:11:08.104  -->  00:11:10.854
So sidebar-start and sidebar-end.
237

237

00:11:12.956  -->  00:11:15.537
And then a second step is that we want it to span
238

238

00:11:15.537  -->  00:11:17.451
all the way from the beginning of the grid
239

239

00:11:17.451  -->  00:11:19.868
to the end, in terms of rows.
240

240

00:11:22.256  -->  00:11:25.408
So grid-row, we want it to start right at the beginning
241

241

00:11:25.408  -->  00:11:26.969
of our design.
242

242

00:11:26.969  -->  00:11:29.993
Remember, so let me show it to you again.
243

243

00:11:29.993  -->  00:11:34.160
So it starts right here, and goes all the way until the end.
244

244

00:11:35.421  -->  00:11:38.704
And so what's like the keyword for the end?
245

245

00:11:38.704  -->  00:11:41.829
That's right, it's minus one.
246

246

00:11:41.829  -->  00:11:44.379
So it starts at the beginning and goes to the end.
247

247

00:11:44.379  -->  00:11:47.534
And yeah, that's exactly what you see happening here.
248

248

00:11:47.534  -->  00:11:50.092
So right now we only have two row tracks,
249

249

00:11:50.092  -->  00:11:52.530
and so right now the sidebar is not as tall
250

250

00:11:52.530  -->  00:11:54.197
as it is in our example,
251

251

00:11:54.197  -->  00:11:56.061
but it'll of course start increasing
252

252

00:11:56.061  -->  00:11:59.306
as we add more rows to the grid.
253

253

00:11:59.306  -->  00:12:01.275
So let's continue, and maybe you're wondering
254

254

00:12:01.275  -->  00:12:04.105
why we are not naming the rows,
255

255

00:12:04.105  -->  00:12:06.728
we are only naming the columns and not the rows.
256

256

00:12:06.728  -->  00:12:08.857
And that is because in an overall layout like this,
257

257

00:12:08.857  -->  00:12:11.596
the focus is always more on the columns
258

258

00:12:11.596  -->  00:12:13.392
and not so much on the rows.
259

259

00:12:13.392  -->  00:12:17.018
So sometimes you might not even want to size the rows here
260

260

00:12:17.018  -->  00:12:19.242
because sometimes all you really want to do
261

261

00:12:19.242  -->  00:12:22.202
is set all your rows to fit to your content.
262

262

00:12:22.202  -->  00:12:23.035
And in that case,
263

263

00:12:23.035  -->  00:12:24.942
you only really need to define the columns,
264

264

00:12:24.942  -->  00:12:27.070
because the columns are always more important.
265

265

00:12:27.070  -->  00:12:29.903
So let's now do the features part.
266

266

00:12:31.235  -->  00:12:34.068
So the features, remember, they go
267

267

00:12:36.050  -->  00:12:39.800
from this part here, all the way to this part.
268

268

00:12:39.800  -->  00:12:42.027
So basically from the beginning to the end
269

269

00:12:42.027  -->  00:12:44.419
of our central eight grids.
270

270

00:12:44.419  -->  00:12:49.181
And that's what we called the center here, right.
271

271

00:12:49.181  -->  00:12:52.403
So remember that we called it center-start,
272

272

00:12:52.403  -->  00:12:53.694
then we have the eight columns,
273

273

00:12:53.694  -->  00:12:56.422
and then we have the grid line called center-end.
274

274

00:12:56.422  -->  00:13:00.339
And so all we have to do is to use these names.
275

275

00:13:02.501  -->  00:13:03.751
So grid-column,
276

276

00:13:06.009  -->  00:13:09.259
center-start,
all the way to center-end.
277

277

00:13:16.454  -->  00:13:18.217
And here we go.
278

278

00:13:18.217  -->  00:13:20.272
So you see, it starts here,
279

279

00:13:20.272  -->  00:13:21.962
and then it ends down here.
280

280

00:13:21.962  -->  00:13:24.928
So exactly what we want it to have.
281

281

00:13:24.928  -->  00:13:27.658
We also have the header, and the top three realtors,
282

282

00:13:27.658  -->  00:13:29.931
but let's leave them for a bit later,
283

283

00:13:29.931  -->  00:13:33.569
because these are not as straight-forward as the others.
284

284

00:13:33.569  -->  00:13:36.474
And so let's actually now continue
285

285

00:13:36.474  -->  00:13:39.141
with the gallery and the footer.
286

286

00:13:40.526  -->  00:13:42.217
So the gallery we see goes all the way
287

287

00:13:42.217  -->  00:13:44.606
from one end to the other end.
288

288

00:13:44.606  -->  00:13:46.923
And so remember what we called this,
289

289

00:13:46.923  -->  00:13:49.642
we call it the full, so the full-bleed section.
290

290

00:13:49.642  -->  00:13:52.309
And so full-start, and full-end.
291

291

00:13:53.309  -->  00:13:55.059
And so let's do that.
292

292

00:13:58.312  -->  00:14:01.479
So grid-column starting at full-start,
293

293

00:14:04.094  -->  00:14:06.011
and ending at full-end.
294

294

00:14:09.006  -->  00:14:10.561
And the same actually for the footer,
295

295

00:14:10.561  -->  00:14:12.561
so let's just copy this.
296

296

00:14:16.327  -->  00:14:18.429
And let's check it out.
297

297

00:14:18.429  -->  00:14:20.597
Moving down here,
298

298

00:14:20.597  -->  00:14:21.902
and here you go.
299

299

00:14:21.902  -->  00:14:24.641
So, the gallery spans all the way from the sidebar
300

300

00:14:24.641  -->  00:14:27.986
here to the end, and as well as the footer.
301

301

00:14:27.986  -->  00:14:31.318
Let's actually increase here the font size
302

302

00:14:31.318  -->  00:14:33.916
of all of these items here at the same time.
303

303

00:14:33.916  -->  00:14:36.974
And so I'm just gonna use it like this,
304

304

00:14:36.974  -->  00:14:38.680
so I say that I want the container,
305

305

00:14:38.680  -->  00:14:40.237
and then all of the right children.
306

306

00:14:40.237  -->  00:14:42.509
And this is just here for development purposes,
307

307

00:14:42.509  -->  00:14:45.245
so I'm gonna change that here in a second.
308

308

00:14:45.245  -->  00:14:49.412
So let's just give all of these a 40 pixels of padding
309

309

00:14:50.591  -->  00:14:53.008
and a font size of three rem.
310

310

00:14:54.130  -->  00:14:55.670
Okay and again I'm gonna delete this later,
311

311

00:14:55.670  -->  00:14:57.652
this is just so we can see a bit better
312

312

00:14:57.652  -->  00:14:59.365
what's going on here.
313

313

00:14:59.365  -->  00:15:02.884
And so our row's now a bit larger.
314

314

00:15:02.884  -->  00:15:05.065
This is starting to look real good.
315

315

00:15:05.065  -->  00:15:06.845
Now as for the homes, we actually want them
316

316

00:15:06.845  -->  00:15:08.979
to be the same as the features.
317

317

00:15:08.979  -->  00:15:11.812
So from start-center to start-end.
318

318

00:15:12.987  -->  00:15:13.820
So homes,
319

319

00:15:17.465  -->  00:15:18.465
grid-column,
320

320

00:15:21.566  -->  00:15:24.760
starting from the grid line center-start
321

321

00:15:24.760  -->  00:15:26.510
and go to center-end.
322

322

00:15:29.824  -->  00:15:32.856
And exactly that's what happened.
323

323

00:15:32.856  -->  00:15:35.120
So just like the features, it is occupying
324

324

00:15:35.120  -->  00:15:38.453
our central eight grid part here, right.
325

325

00:15:39.684  -->  00:15:41.685
Now of course we could've used here
326

326

00:15:41.685  -->  00:15:44.981
just the line numbers here and simply make this start
327

327

00:15:44.981  -->  00:15:48.730
from like line number three I think in this case,
328

328

00:15:48.730  -->  00:15:51.499
so one, two, three it would've been.
329

329

00:15:51.499  -->  00:15:54.913
And then say span, and then just add all of these numbers,
330

330

00:15:54.913  -->  00:15:58.149
so spanning from number three to line 11.
331

331

00:15:58.149  -->  00:16:00.189
But that would be highly impractical,
332

332

00:16:00.189  -->  00:16:01.442
and so it's really much easier
333

333

00:16:01.442  -->  00:16:03.998
to name our column lines like this.
334

334

00:16:03.998  -->  00:16:05.802
So we defined the homes, features, gallery,
335

335

00:16:05.802  -->  00:16:07.469
footer, and sidebar.
336

336

00:16:07.469  -->  00:16:10.935
Next up let's think about the header and the realtors.
337

337

00:16:10.935  -->  00:16:14.286
So let's come here to our original design,
338

338

00:16:14.286  -->  00:16:17.515
and so you see that what I did here is to give
339

339

00:16:17.515  -->  00:16:20.828
two parts of our eight columns to this realtors,
340

340

00:16:20.828  -->  00:16:23.328
and six columns to the footer.
341

341

00:16:24.328  -->  00:16:26.766
So basically six out of eight columns
342

342

00:16:26.766  -->  00:16:28.802
are for the header here,
343

343

00:16:28.802  -->  00:16:32.148
and two out of the eight columns are for the realtors.
344

344

00:16:32.148  -->  00:16:34.623
And then of course we add this outer part here,
345

345

00:16:34.623  -->  00:16:36.040
so here and here,
346

346

00:16:36.895  -->  00:16:40.140
so that we end up with a full-bleed look here.
347

347

00:16:40.140  -->  00:16:42.621
And so that is why these columns that we have here
348

348

00:16:42.621  -->  00:16:44.419
in the middle are so useful,
349

349

00:16:44.419  -->  00:16:46.938
because they allow us to build different kind of designs.
350

350

00:16:46.938  -->  00:16:49.668
For example, if you come down here, you see that we used
351

351

00:16:49.668  -->  00:16:53.009
this grid line here in the center to put one part
352

352

00:16:53.009  -->  00:16:54.572
of this design on the left side,
353

353

00:16:54.572  -->  00:16:56.797
and the other part here on the right side
354

354

00:16:56.797  -->  00:16:58.422
of this central line.
355

355

00:16:58.422  -->  00:17:01.228
So in this case, it's four columns for this picture
356

356

00:17:01.228  -->  00:17:04.203
part of the story, and four columns for this content
357

357

00:17:04.203  -->  00:17:05.870
part of the stories.
358

358

00:17:08.440  -->  00:17:11.273
And so let's code that up as well.
359

359

00:17:12.692  -->  00:17:13.859
So the header,
360

360

00:17:18.993  -->  00:17:22.076
grid-column, it starts at full-start,
361

361

00:17:25.008  -->  00:17:28.460
and that's not correct, so start,
362

362

00:17:28.460  -->  00:17:31.960
so full-start is basically here right after the sidebar,
363

363

00:17:31.960  -->  00:17:35.513
and it ends after the sixth columns.
364

364

00:17:35.513  -->  00:17:36.888
So let's actually count this,
365

365

00:17:36.888  -->  00:17:39.333
so this is the first line of this set,
366

366

00:17:39.333  -->  00:17:42.394
so this is the column number one, two, three,
367

367

00:17:42.394  -->  00:17:44.644
four, five, six, and seven.
368

368

00:17:46.608  -->  00:17:51.144
And so this here is the end of column number six.
369

369

00:17:51.144  -->  00:17:54.811
And so it translate into col-end six, right.
370

370

00:17:57.550  -->  00:17:59.243
So remember from the intro lectures,
371

371

00:17:59.243  -->  00:18:01.447
that when we have a named set of grid lines,
372

372

00:18:01.447  -->  00:18:03.925
then we have to use the numbers.
373

373

00:18:03.925  -->  00:18:07.472
And in this case, it ends after the sixth column.
374

374

00:18:07.472  -->  00:18:11.639
And now the realtors, they didn't start right after that.
375

375

00:18:14.223  -->  00:18:17.140
So grid-column, so col-start seven,
376

376

00:18:20.677  -->  00:18:22.927
all the way until full-end.
377

377

00:18:24.428  -->  00:18:26.428
So let's check that out.
378

378

00:18:27.779  -->  00:18:32.155
And yeah, so that's exactly what we have here in our demo.
379

379

00:18:32.155  -->  00:18:35.364
So you see, it's exactly the same.
380

380

00:18:35.364  -->  00:18:38.322
So just to make sure that you understand why this works,
381

381

00:18:38.322  -->  00:18:41.174
let's remember that this here is the first column.
382

382

00:18:41.174  -->  00:18:44.387
So column-start, number one, two, three, four,
383

383

00:18:44.387  -->  00:18:46.137
five, six, and seven.
384

384

00:18:47.021  -->  00:18:50.698
And so it starts at the seventh column right here
385

385

00:18:50.698  -->  00:18:52.703
and goes all the way until the end of course.
386

386

00:18:52.703  -->  00:18:54.264
And so now all that's left to do
387

387

00:18:54.264  -->  00:18:57.527
is to place the story pictures and story content,
388

388

00:18:57.527  -->  00:18:59.610
'cause right now they are not really where
389

389

00:18:59.610  -->  00:19:00.716
they are supposed to are.
390

390

00:19:00.716  -->  00:19:04.357
So let's take a look at that again.
391

391

00:19:04.357  -->  00:19:06.176
And yeah, I already explained that before.
392

392

00:19:06.176  -->  00:19:08.689
So it goes all the way until the end of the fourth column,
393

393

00:19:08.689  -->  00:19:11.108
and then the next one, so the content,
394

394

00:19:11.108  -->  00:19:14.914
it starts at the beginning of the fifth column.
395

395

00:19:14.914  -->  00:19:16.331
So let's do that.
396

396

00:19:22.355  -->  00:19:24.605
So grid-column, full-start,
397

397

00:19:26.489  -->  00:19:29.072
and it goes until col-end four.
398

398

00:19:30.353  -->  00:19:33.045
So that's exactly what I said before, right.
399

399

00:19:33.045  -->  00:19:36.378
And then this one goes from grid-column,
400

400

00:19:38.833  -->  00:19:42.333
col-start five, so the fifth column, until
401

401

00:19:45.476  -->  00:19:46.795
full-end.
402

402

00:19:46.795  -->  00:19:50.740
And that should be it.
So let's check that out.
403

403

00:19:50.740  -->  00:19:53.049
And yeah, it's correct.
404

404

00:19:53.049  -->  00:19:55.792
That's exactly what we were looking for.
405

405

00:19:55.792  -->  00:19:58.190
Awesome, so that's really great.
406

406

00:19:58.190  -->  00:20:00.999
So with this, we finished our overall layout, actually.
407

407

00:20:00.999  -->  00:20:02.657
So great, that's fantastic.
408

408

00:20:02.657  -->  00:20:05.879
So it's really simple to create a complex layout like this,
409

409

00:20:05.879  -->  00:20:07.896
and I think this is really rather complex,
410

410

00:20:07.896  -->  00:20:10.719
so I tried to do something not all too weird,
411

411

00:20:10.719  -->  00:20:13.312
but at the same time to go into some complexity
412

412

00:20:13.312  -->  00:20:17.775
so that we don't just build another boring demo layout here.
413

413

00:20:17.775  -->  00:20:20.790
So instead we went for a real-world look here
414

414

00:20:20.790  -->  00:20:22.386
with this design.
415

415

00:20:22.386  -->  00:20:25.144
Now one last thing that I want to change here
416

416

00:20:25.144  -->  00:20:28.005
is something for this situation.
417

417

00:20:28.005  -->  00:20:30.314
So imagine that we start decreasing here,
418

418

00:20:30.314  -->  00:20:32.362
then of course our eight columns here
419

419

00:20:32.362  -->  00:20:34.875
always stay nicely centered, right.
420

420

00:20:34.875  -->  00:20:38.790
And you can see this very well here in this blue homes part.
421

421

00:20:38.790  -->  00:20:41.113
So you see that it stays centered, of course,
422

422

00:20:41.113  -->  00:20:42.988
and that's exactly what we defined.
423

423

00:20:42.988  -->  00:20:46.783
But watch what happens as we really approach the width
424

424

00:20:46.783  -->  00:20:48.283
of these eight columns.
425

425

00:20:48.283  -->  00:20:49.779
So you see that at some point,
426

426

00:20:49.779  -->  00:20:52.239
here this space on the left and on the right side
427

427

00:20:52.239  -->  00:20:53.498
almost disappears.
428

428

00:20:53.498  -->  00:20:55.626
And that's because this column here,
429

429

00:20:55.626  -->  00:20:58.028
so this column track and this column track,
430

430

00:20:58.028  -->  00:21:00.306
they are defined to be one fr, so one fraction
431

431

00:21:00.306  -->  00:21:01.967
of the remaining space.
432

432

00:21:01.967  -->  00:21:04.442
And so they do exactly what we told them to do.
433

433

00:21:04.442  -->  00:21:07.820
But we actually don't want it to be quite like that,
434

434

00:21:07.820  -->  00:21:10.116
because we usually always want to have some margin
435

435

00:21:10.116  -->  00:21:14.160
between the content and the margin of the page.
436

436

00:21:14.160  -->  00:21:17.336
And in this case, this really starts to stick here
437

437

00:21:17.336  -->  00:21:18.725
to the sidebar.
438

438

00:21:18.725  -->  00:21:20.485
And so that's not ideal,
439

439

00:21:20.485  -->  00:21:22.868
and so what we can do is something very simple.
440

440

00:21:22.868  -->  00:21:25.868
So what do you think we can do here?
441

441

00:21:27.504  -->  00:21:29.276
Well, all we have to do here
442

442

00:21:29.276  -->  00:21:32.779
is to use the minmax function here.
443

443

00:21:32.779  -->  00:21:36.414
And so we say that we want this to be
444

444

00:21:36.414  -->  00:21:40.581
between six rem, so 60 pixel, and one fractional unit.
445

445

00:21:41.910  -->  00:21:44.767
And just like this, we will always keep a minimum
446

446

00:21:44.767  -->  00:21:46.934
of 60 pixels on this side.
447

447

00:21:47.786  -->  00:21:52.066
And of course, we want the same here on the other side.
448

448

00:21:52.066  -->  00:21:55.094
So what we did with this is to ensure that this column
449

449

00:21:55.094  -->  00:21:57.761
never gets smaller than six rem.
450

450

00:21:58.626  -->  00:22:00.777
And instead, what will start to shrink
451

451

00:22:00.777  -->  00:22:03.297
when there's not enough space to fit
452

452

00:22:03.297  -->  00:22:05.908
these 40 rem columns here in the viewport,
453

453

00:22:05.908  -->  00:22:08.275
will be the columns themselves.
454

454

00:22:08.275  -->  00:22:11.898
So they are the ones who will start shrinking.
455

455

00:22:11.898  -->  00:22:13.274
So let's take a look at that.
456

456

00:22:13.274  -->  00:22:14.774
So as we approach,
457

457

00:22:15.866  -->  00:22:19.315
you see, so we approach these 60 pixels here,
458

458

00:22:19.315  -->  00:22:21.982
and let's actually inspect that.
459

459

00:22:22.841  -->  00:22:25.135
Inspected element.
460

460

00:22:25.135  -->  00:22:29.302
And actually we cannot, we cannot inspect it really.
461

461

00:22:31.307  -->  00:22:33.617
Instead let's do it like this.
462

462

00:22:33.617  -->  00:22:36.153
So here we see that this has 60 pixels,
463

463

00:22:36.153  -->  00:22:37.486
so 60 times 511.
464

464

00:22:39.086  -->  00:22:42.626
And so these 60 pixels is the six rem that we just defined.
465

465

00:22:42.626  -->  00:22:45.817
So that's the minimum that this column will always have
466

466

00:22:45.817  -->  00:22:47.067
no matter what.
467

467

00:22:48.272  -->  00:22:50.831
And so as we now decrease the viewport,
468

468

00:22:50.831  -->  00:22:53.581
the columns will start to shrink.
469

469

00:22:57.024  -->  00:22:58.942
And so what this does is that it basically
470

470

00:22:58.942  -->  00:23:02.059
ensures that there's always a margin between the content
471

471

00:23:02.059  -->  00:23:04.059
and the end of the page.
472

472

00:23:05.335  -->  00:23:08.791
And so with that, our layout is actually really completed.
473

473

00:23:08.791  -->  00:23:10.391
There's nothing more we have to add,
474

474

00:23:10.391  -->  00:23:12.863
and we are ready to now build all of these sections
475

475

00:23:12.863  -->  00:23:13.780
one by one.
476

476

00:23:15.627  -->  00:23:18.003
So I know that this was probably rather complex
477

477

00:23:18.003  -->  00:23:20.066
for a beginner like you,
478

478

00:23:20.066  -->  00:23:22.599
but that's why I build this layout here step by step,
479

479

00:23:22.599  -->  00:23:24.314
starting with just eight columns,
480

480

00:23:24.314  -->  00:23:26.042
and then going up from there,
481

481

00:23:26.042  -->  00:23:29.966
until we reached, in the end, this fully-fledged design.
482

482

00:23:29.966  -->  00:23:32.091
So once more, I want you to really understand
483

483

00:23:32.091  -->  00:23:34.834
what happened here, and to experiment with it
484

484

00:23:34.834  -->  00:23:36.667
in case you didn't.
485

485

00:23:36.667  -->  00:23:38.380
So it's really important that before moving forward,
486

486

00:23:38.380  -->  00:23:42.220
you are 100% sure you know what we did here.
487

487

00:23:42.220  -->  00:23:44.726
So that this really makes sense to you.
488

488

00:23:44.726  -->  00:23:45.637
And if you have any questions,
489

489

00:23:45.637  -->  00:23:48.256
and of course you can post it to the Q&amp;A section
490

490

00:23:48.256  -->  00:23:50.977
on Udemy, and you will get then help there,
491

491

00:23:50.977  -->  00:23:53.101
so that you can make sure that you understand
492

492

00:23:53.101  -->  00:23:55.289
100% what's going on here so that you can
493

493

00:23:55.289  -->  00:23:57.719
build your own layouts in the future.
494

494

00:23:57.719  -->  00:23:59.589
And they will not always be like this,
495

495

00:23:59.589  -->  00:24:01.693
so sometimes it may be a bit simpler
496

496

00:24:01.693  -->  00:24:04.676
and you just have to use then the tools that I gave you
497

497

00:24:04.676  -->  00:24:06.229
to build your own layout.
498

498

00:24:06.229  -->  00:24:08.126
So you may not always have like a sidebar,
499

499

00:24:08.126  -->  00:24:10.775
or some of the things that I have here.
500

500

00:24:10.775  -->  00:24:13.537
They might not really apply to your own particular design.
501

501

00:24:13.537  -->  00:24:15.406
But as I said before, I wanted to have something
502

502

00:24:15.406  -->  00:24:17.770
more complex so that we can actually apply
503

503

00:24:17.770  -->  00:24:19.702
all of the contents that we learned before
504

504

00:24:19.702  -->  00:24:21.608
to this real world situation.
505

505

00:24:21.608  -->  00:24:24.464
But enough talking, let's move on to the next video
506

506

00:24:24.464  -->  00:24:27.214
and start building this web page.
