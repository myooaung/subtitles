00:00:01,428  -->  00:00:02,554
<v Instructor>This is part two</v>
2

2

00:00:02,554  -->  00:00:05,917
of building the app's header section.
3

3

00:00:05,917  -->  00:00:07,345
So, to start this lecture,
4

4

00:00:07,345  -->  00:00:09,284
let's actually put these three elements
5

5

00:00:09,284  -->  00:00:12,151
that we have here in the header side by side.
6

6

00:00:12,151  -->  00:00:13,800
And how do we do that?
7

7

00:00:13,800  -->  00:00:15,263
Well, you guessed it.
8

8

00:00:15,263  -->  00:00:17,411
We're gonna use Flexbox.
9

9

00:00:17,411  -->  00:00:20,557
So, what should be the flex container here in this case?
10

10

00:00:20,557  -->  00:00:22,856
Well, it should simply be the parent element
11

11

00:00:22,856  -->  00:00:25,433
of the elements that we want side by side.
12

12

00:00:25,433  -->  00:00:26,687
And that's these three here.
13

13

00:00:26,687  -->  00:00:29,241
So, the logo, the search bar,
14

14

00:00:29,241  -->  00:00:31,526
and the user navigation, right?
15

15

00:00:31,526  -->  00:00:35,609
And so the parent of these is the header element.
16

16

00:00:36,521  -->  00:00:37,771
So, here we go.
17

17

00:00:39,758  -->  00:00:41,699
Now, so in the header.
18

18

00:00:41,699  -->  00:00:43,011
So, all we have to do is
19

19

00:00:43,011  -->  00:00:44,844
to set display to flex
20

20

00:00:46,018  -->  00:00:48,804
and that will put them side by side.
21

21

00:00:48,804  -->  00:00:52,287
Alright, now let's give them actually some background color
22

22

00:00:52,287  -->  00:00:55,573
so that we can see what's going on here.
23

23

00:00:55,573  -->  00:00:56,823
So, the search.
24

24

00:01:01,923  -->  00:01:05,058
I'm gonna use my orangered favorite here again.
25

25

00:01:05,058  -->  00:01:08,141
And then on this one here, we can use
26

26

00:01:10,213  -->  00:01:11,713
like, greenyellow.
27

27

00:01:14,323  -->  00:01:15,972
Alright, check it out.
28

28

00:01:15,972  -->  00:01:17,852
So, ah, here we go.
29

29

00:01:17,852  -->  00:01:20,174
Now, how do we want these to be aligned?
30

30

00:01:20,174  -->  00:01:21,730
We want this green one here,
31

31

00:01:21,730  -->  00:01:23,052
so the user navigation,
32

32

00:01:23,052  -->  00:01:25,306
all the way to the right side, right?
33

33

00:01:25,306  -->  00:01:26,955
And then this one here in the middle.
34

34

00:01:26,955  -->  00:01:30,877
And what is the Flexbox property that allows us to do that?
35

35

00:01:30,877  -->  00:01:33,130
I hope that you printed your cheat sheet
36

36

00:01:33,130  -->  00:01:34,627
so that you can take a look at it
37

37

00:01:34,627  -->  00:01:38,353
and find out which property we have to use, okay?
38

38

00:01:38,353  -->  00:01:40,014
And in case you don't know,
39

39

00:01:40,014  -->  00:01:42,499
we need to use justify-content.
40

40

00:01:42,499  -->  00:01:45,877
And of course, that one is again on the flex container,
41

41

00:01:45,877  -->  00:01:48,046
not on the flex items, okay?
42

42

00:01:48,046  -->  00:01:51,311
So, justify-content will align the elements
43

43

00:01:51,311  -->  00:01:53,075
along the main axis.
44

44

00:01:53,075  -->  00:01:55,743
And that's the one we're talking about here, right?
45

45

00:01:55,743  -->  00:01:58,136
So, what are the possible values here?
46

46

00:01:58,136  -->  00:02:00,819
For example, we could use center.
47

47

00:02:00,819  -->  00:02:02,654
Just to show it to you.
48

48

00:02:02,654  -->  00:02:04,349
And that's what that would do.
49

49

00:02:04,349  -->  00:02:06,576
So, it would simply center all of these elements
50

50

00:02:06,576  -->  00:02:09,713
side by side here in the center of the flex container.
51

51

00:02:09,713  -->  00:02:11,361
But that's also not what we want.
52

52

00:02:11,361  -->  00:02:15,111
Because what we really want is space between.
53

53

00:02:16,375  -->  00:02:17,208
Okay?
54

54

00:02:17,208  -->  00:02:19,244
And so, it will basically divide the empty space
55

55

00:02:19,244  -->  00:02:22,228
between these three elements.
56

56

00:02:22,228  -->  00:02:24,967
And that's what that looks like, and it's perfect.
57

57

00:02:24,967  -->  00:02:26,443
That's exactly what we want.
58

58

00:02:26,443  -->  00:02:29,426
We could also do like space-around.
59

59

00:02:29,426  -->  00:02:32,004
Let me show that to you as well.
60

60

00:02:32,004  -->  00:02:33,281
It would result in this one,
61

61

00:02:33,281  -->  00:02:35,092
but that puts way too much space
62

62

00:02:35,092  -->  00:02:36,566
here on the left side of this one
63

63

00:02:36,566  -->  00:02:37,867
and here on the right side.
64

64

00:02:37,867  -->  00:02:38,700
So, we don't want that,
65

65

00:02:38,700  -->  00:02:40,224
we only want a little space,
66

66

00:02:40,224  -->  00:02:42,302
and so we're gonna do that later with margins.
67

67

00:02:42,302  -->  00:02:46,400
But for now, in here, let's do space-between.
68

68

00:02:46,400  -->  00:02:47,282
And I think that this one
69

69

00:02:47,282  -->  00:02:50,928
is actually the most useful one of all.
70

70

00:02:50,928  -->  00:02:51,822
Alright?
71

71

00:02:51,822  -->  00:02:54,341
So, that is alignment along the main axis,
72

72

00:02:54,341  -->  00:02:55,885
so from left to right.
73

73

00:02:55,885  -->  00:02:57,777
But we also want to align these items
74

74

00:02:57,777  -->  00:02:59,740
along the cross axis, right?
75

75

00:02:59,740  -->  00:03:02,538
So, basically here from top to bottom.
76

76

00:03:02,538  -->  00:03:04,593
So that, for example, we can have this image here
77

77

00:03:04,593  -->  00:03:07,530
nicely centered vertically in the header.
78

78

00:03:07,530  -->  00:03:09,829
So, if we didn't have Flexbox, we could now use like
79

79

00:03:09,829  -->  00:03:12,302
margin-top and would then have to experiment
80

80

00:03:12,302  -->  00:03:14,006
which is the perfect margin.
81

81

00:03:14,006  -->  00:03:16,514
But Flexbox makes our lives so much easier
82

82

00:03:16,514  -->  00:03:17,735
and all we have to do is
83

83

00:03:17,735  -->  00:03:21,218
to use the align-items property, right?
84

84

00:03:21,218  -->  00:03:23,807
So, remember that one.
85

85

00:03:23,807  -->  00:03:25,140
So, align-items,
86

86

00:03:27,011  -->  00:03:29,903
and simply set it to center.
87

87

00:03:29,903  -->  00:03:31,470
And that's what it will produce.
88

88

00:03:31,470  -->  00:03:34,272
So, this one is now nicely centered vertically,
89

89

00:03:34,272  -->  00:03:35,937
so along the cross axis,
90

90

00:03:35,937  -->  00:03:38,639
and so is this one, and this one.
91

91

00:03:38,639  -->  00:03:40,135
This one is of course overlapping it
92

92

00:03:40,135  -->  00:03:42,437
because there is too much content in it,
93

93

00:03:42,437  -->  00:03:44,561
but still, it is now centered.
94

94

00:03:44,561  -->  00:03:47,185
So, you saw that before, it was set to stretch.
95

95

00:03:47,185  -->  00:03:50,320
That's why this element here was occupying the entire space,
96

96

00:03:50,320  -->  00:03:52,317
so everything here was orange, right?
97

97

00:03:52,317  -->  00:03:53,501
But now we set it to center,
98

98

00:03:53,501  -->  00:03:55,774
and so it's vertically centered now.
99

99

00:03:55,774  -->  00:03:57,994
So, that is align-items.
100

100

00:03:57,994  -->  00:03:59,863
So, all we have to really do now is
101

101

00:03:59,863  -->  00:04:03,280
to just format these elements here, okay?
102

102

00:04:04,207  -->  00:04:06,624
So, let's start with our logo
103

103

00:04:08,463  -->  00:04:11,248
and simply give it some margin to the left side
104

104

00:04:11,248  -->  00:04:12,831
of three rem, okay.
105

105

00:04:14,627  -->  00:04:15,634
And so now that's perfect.
106

106

00:04:15,634  -->  00:04:17,899
So, really nicely positioned here.
107

107

00:04:17,899  -->  00:04:20,339
So, starting here with the search element,
108

108

00:04:20,339  -->  00:04:23,541
let's first give it some width, okay?
109

109

00:04:23,541  -->  00:04:25,436
And since it's a flex item,
110

110

00:04:25,436  -->  00:04:28,638
let's do that using the flex property.
111

111

00:04:28,638  -->  00:04:30,695
So, flex, we don't want it to grow
112

112

00:04:30,695  -->  00:04:33,398
to fill all its available space, okay?
113

113

00:04:33,398  -->  00:04:35,292
We also don't want it to shrink.
114

114

00:04:35,292  -->  00:04:39,447
And we want it to occupy 40% of the header, okay?
115

115

00:04:39,447  -->  00:04:42,047
Now, as for the input element,
116

116

00:04:42,047  -->  00:04:43,872
this is how we want it to look like, okay?
117

117

00:04:43,872  -->  00:04:46,449
So, it's this gray rounded element here
118

118

00:04:46,449  -->  00:04:49,352
with this gray icon here at the end, okay?
119

119

00:04:49,352  -->  00:04:51,185
So, let's now do that.
120

120

00:04:52,380  -->  00:04:55,747
And so we start with the font family,
121

121

00:04:55,747  -->  00:04:58,157
which on an input element doesn't inherit
122

122

00:04:58,157  -->  00:05:00,511
the font family of the global document.
123

123

00:05:00,511  -->  00:05:04,032
And so we have to automatically set it to inherit here
124

124

00:05:04,032  -->  00:05:07,699
and the same thing for the font size actually.
125

125

00:05:07,699  -->  00:05:10,636
So, let's set it to inherit here as well.
126

126

00:05:10,636  -->  00:05:13,678
And then we want the background color,
127

127

00:05:13,678  -->  00:05:15,686
and again we're gonna use our variables here.
128

128

00:05:15,686  -->  00:05:18,148
And the one that we want right now is this,
129

129

00:05:18,148  -->  00:05:19,599
this gray color here, okay?
130

130

00:05:19,599  -->  00:05:21,182
So, light gray two.
131

131

00:05:28,499  -->  00:05:30,916
We want it to have no border.
132

132

00:05:32,960  -->  00:05:36,614
We also want the text color to be inherited, okay?
133

133

00:05:36,614  -->  00:05:40,144
So, we set all of these here in the same place.
134

134

00:05:40,144  -->  00:05:41,734
Well, what else can we do?
135

135

00:05:41,734  -->  00:05:44,405
We can set some padding,
136

136

00:05:44,405  -->  00:05:47,072
so .7 rem on the top and bottom.
137

137

00:05:49,293  -->  00:05:51,669
And two rem on the left and on the right side.
138

138

00:05:51,669  -->  00:05:53,053
So, 20 pixels.
139

139

00:05:53,053  -->  00:05:56,439
Now, we also can set the border radius
140

140

00:05:56,439  -->  00:06:00,233
to a really high number, doesn't matter.
141

141

00:06:00,233  -->  00:06:02,069
Can even set it in pixels, it doesn't really matter,
142

142

00:06:02,069  -->  00:06:05,727
just a high number so that it has these rounded edges.
143

143

00:06:05,727  -->  00:06:08,676
And, okay, let's take a look, actually.
144

144

00:06:08,676  -->  00:06:10,417
And that's what it look like.
145

145

00:06:10,417  -->  00:06:12,112
Well, still not perfect,
146

146

00:06:12,112  -->  00:06:13,772
but we're kind of getting there.
147

147

00:06:13,772  -->  00:06:16,373
We have to actually give it a width here, okay?
148

148

00:06:16,373  -->  00:06:18,411
And we're not doing 100%,
149

149

00:06:18,411  -->  00:06:21,861
because we want this to happen when we click it.
150

150

00:06:21,861  -->  00:06:22,694
You saw that?
151

151

00:06:22,694  -->  00:06:25,019
So, it expanded when it received the focus,
152

152

00:06:25,019  -->  00:06:26,610
and when we click outside,
153

153

00:06:26,610  -->  00:06:29,791
it goes back to the original size.
154

154

00:06:29,791  -->  00:06:32,287
So, let's set it to,
155

155

00:06:32,287  -->  00:06:33,537
like, 90%.
156

156

00:06:36,235  -->  00:06:37,068
Okay?
157

157

00:06:37,068  -->  00:06:38,847
And then we can also change what we want
158

158

00:06:38,847  -->  00:06:42,190
to happen when we focus the element.
159

159

00:06:42,190  -->  00:06:43,023
So, focus.
160

160

00:06:44,627  -->  00:06:48,011
We don't want an outline, okay?
161

161

00:06:48,011  -->  00:06:49,722
But instead what we want to happen
162

162

00:06:49,722  -->  00:06:53,577
is that the width should be set to 100%.
163

163

00:06:53,577  -->  00:06:55,852
So, that was the effect that we saw earlier.
164

164

00:06:55,852  -->  00:06:58,081
So, when the input element becomes focused,
165

165

00:06:58,081  -->  00:07:02,527
it increases from 90% to 100% of its available width.
166

166

00:07:02,527  -->  00:07:05,976
Which is this 40% here of the parent element.
167

167

00:07:05,976  -->  00:07:08,693
And we also want it to become a little bit darker,
168

168

00:07:08,693  -->  00:07:11,584
which is basically the same thing as this
169

169

00:07:11,584  -->  00:07:13,254
but the light number three.
170

170

00:07:13,254  -->  00:07:15,507
So, that's a bit darker.
171

171

00:07:15,507  -->  00:07:17,757
And for the animation here,
172

172

00:07:18,897  -->  00:07:21,397
transition all and .2 seconds.
173

173

00:07:23,053  -->  00:07:26,025
So, let's take a look at that now.
174

174

00:07:26,025  -->  00:07:27,511
And that's much better.
175

175

00:07:27,511  -->  00:07:29,043
So, when we click it,
176

176

00:07:29,043  -->  00:07:31,210
it increases to 100%.
177

177

00:07:32,283  -->  00:07:33,116
Great.
178

178

00:07:33,116  -->  00:07:34,452
Well, it's still not perfect,
179

179

00:07:34,452  -->  00:07:35,905
but for now, let's continue
180

180

00:07:35,905  -->  00:07:39,620
with styling this button here now, okay?
181

181

00:07:39,620  -->  00:07:42,674
So, here we are, the button.
182

182

00:07:42,674  -->  00:07:46,343
So, first, we don't want any border on it,
183

183

00:07:46,343  -->  00:07:47,190
and then we want it to have
184

184

00:07:47,190  -->  00:07:49,324
the same background color as the input.
185

185

00:07:49,324  -->  00:07:51,682
Because we basically want it to be
186

186

00:07:51,682  -->  00:07:54,349
like on top of the input, right?
187

187

00:07:55,247  -->  00:07:57,140
And actually, in order for that to happen,
188

188

00:07:57,140  -->  00:07:58,823
we should give the input here
189

189

00:07:58,823  -->  00:08:02,806
some negative margin on the right side.
190

190

00:08:02,806  -->  00:08:06,223
So, margin-right, and then like -3.5 rem.
191

191

00:08:07,798  -->  00:08:10,050
And so this way, the button will move
192

192

00:08:10,050  -->  00:08:12,217
on top of the input, okay?
193

193

00:08:13,626  -->  00:08:17,793
Now let's also just remove the focus here from this one.
194

194

00:08:20,604  -->  00:08:22,021
So, outline none.
195

195

00:08:22,995  -->  00:08:24,352
But what happens instead
196

196

00:08:24,352  -->  00:08:26,084
is that basically when we click the button,
197

197

00:08:26,084  -->  00:08:29,001
we just want it to move a bit down.
198

198

00:08:30,541  -->  00:08:32,624
So, transform translateY,
199

199

00:08:34,604  -->  00:08:37,521
and then let's just say two pixels.
200

200

00:08:39,886  -->  00:08:41,985
Alright, let's take a look now.
201

201

00:08:41,985  -->  00:08:42,963
And that's much better.
202

202

00:08:42,963  -->  00:08:45,970
So, now it's actually on top of the search bar,
203

203

00:08:45,970  -->  00:08:46,803
and when we click this,
204

204

00:08:46,803  -->  00:08:49,128
we see this nice animation going on.
205

205

00:08:49,128  -->  00:08:50,254
Now, what's left to do here
206

206

00:08:50,254  -->  00:08:53,389
is to actually center this icon here vertically
207

207

00:08:53,389  -->  00:08:56,152
as well as horizontally, right?
208

208

00:08:56,152  -->  00:08:58,102
Because when the input field is not active,
209

209

00:08:58,102  -->  00:09:00,841
we want it to be at the center of this element here, right?
210

210

00:09:00,841  -->  00:09:02,224
So, of the parent element.
211

211

00:09:02,224  -->  00:09:03,710
So, how do we do that?
212

212

00:09:03,710  -->  00:09:07,553
Well, the best solution is, once again, to use Flexbox.
213

213

00:09:07,553  -->  00:09:10,061
And so you see, each time we want to center something,
214

214

00:09:10,061  -->  00:09:13,461
or to align something, we can always use Flexbox.
215

215

00:09:13,461  -->  00:09:17,375
For Flexbox is perfect for all of these small situations
216

216

00:09:17,375  -->  00:09:21,171
where you need to align or center some elements.
217

217

00:09:21,171  -->  00:09:22,054
So, what should actually be
218

218

00:09:22,054  -->  00:09:24,653
the flex container of these elements?
219

219

00:09:24,653  -->  00:09:28,653
Well, of course, it's the search element, right?
220

220

00:09:29,740  -->  00:09:31,377
And so now, for the first time,
221

221

00:09:31,377  -->  00:09:33,744
we're doing something that we didn't do before.
222

222

00:09:33,744  -->  00:09:38,051
Which is that a flex item is becoming a flex container.
223

223

00:09:38,051  -->  00:09:39,968
And that is perfectly possible.
224

224

00:09:39,968  -->  00:09:43,317
So, we now have nested Flexbox.
225

225

00:09:43,317  -->  00:09:44,150
Okay?
226

226

00:09:46,545  -->  00:09:49,659
So, again, let's take a look.
227

227

00:09:49,659  -->  00:09:51,459
And it's already centered, you see,
228

228

00:09:51,459  -->  00:09:54,626
because align-items is set to stretch.
229

229

00:09:57,171  -->  00:10:00,956
So, align-items, let's move it from stretch
230

230

00:10:00,956  -->  00:10:05,123
to center, and then justify-content also to center.
231

231

00:10:07,597  -->  00:10:10,102
So, again, align-items to center
232

232

00:10:10,102  -->  00:10:12,808
centers the elements along the cross axis
233

233

00:10:12,808  -->  00:10:14,783
and justify-content center
234

234

00:10:14,783  -->  00:10:17,628
centers the elements along the main axis.
235

235

00:10:17,628  -->  00:10:19,926
So, let's check that out.
236

236

00:10:19,926  -->  00:10:23,651
And, yup, that is exactly what we wanted, right?
237

237

00:10:23,651  -->  00:10:26,811
So, now I hit this and now it grows to the sides.
238

238

00:10:26,811  -->  00:10:28,088
So, that's perfect.
239

239

00:10:28,088  -->  00:10:30,840
Now, this margin here is not perfect here actually,
240

240

00:10:30,840  -->  00:10:32,626
but that's because of the negative margin
241

241

00:10:32,626  -->  00:10:34,555
that I gave it here on the other side.
242

242

00:10:34,555  -->  00:10:36,749
Which is actually a bit too much.
243

243

00:10:36,749  -->  00:10:38,082
So, it was here.
244

244

00:10:39,431  -->  00:10:41,229
And actually, another thing that we have to do
245

245

00:10:41,229  -->  00:10:43,077
is to set the background color of the button
246

246

00:10:43,077  -->  00:10:46,873
to the same color of this focused here
247

247

00:10:46,873  -->  00:10:49,392
when the input is focused, right?
248

248

00:10:49,392  -->  00:10:50,948
So, right now if you look closely,
249

249

00:10:50,948  -->  00:10:53,119
you will see that if the input is selected,
250

250

00:10:53,119  -->  00:10:54,838
the background color here of this icon
251

251

00:10:54,838  -->  00:10:57,009
is slightly lighter, okay?
252

252

00:10:57,009  -->  00:10:58,592
So, let's fix that.
253

253

00:11:00,492  -->  00:11:04,075
And we have to actually do it outside here.
254

254

00:11:05,217  -->  00:11:06,717
So, __input:focus,
255

255

00:11:08,735  -->  00:11:13,506
and then select the adjacent search button, right?
256

256

00:11:13,506  -->  00:11:17,233
So, we did that a lot of time in the other project.
257

257

00:11:17,233  -->  00:11:18,983
So, just to remember,
258

258

00:11:20,424  -->  00:11:23,346
here we have the input, and here we have the button.
259

259

00:11:23,346  -->  00:11:24,891
And they are siblings, okay?
260

260

00:11:24,891  -->  00:11:27,329
And so therefore, we can use the adjacent selector
261

261

00:11:27,329  -->  00:11:31,497
to select the sibling of the selected input, okay?
262

262

00:11:31,497  -->  00:11:34,098
So, here in the components.
263

263

00:11:34,098  -->  00:11:35,340
And now, what we want to happen
264

264

00:11:35,340  -->  00:11:37,242
is that the button becomes
265

265

00:11:37,242  -->  00:11:40,994
the same background color as the input, okay?
266

266

00:11:40,994  -->  00:11:43,897
And so now, it should be perfect.
267

267

00:11:43,897  -->  00:11:46,161
Alright, now one last thing is
268

268

00:11:46,161  -->  00:11:48,399
the color of this magnifying glass.
269

269

00:11:48,399  -->  00:11:49,513
Remember that I told you
270

270

00:11:49,513  -->  00:11:51,104
that with the way that we included
271

271

00:11:51,104  -->  00:11:53,336
the svg sprite in the HTML,
272

272

00:11:53,336  -->  00:11:55,518
we could change the svg color
273

273

00:11:55,518  -->  00:11:57,562
right in CSS, right?
274

274

00:11:57,562  -->  00:12:00,522
So, let me now show you how we can do that.
275

275

00:12:00,522  -->  00:12:02,020
And it's actually very easy.
276

276

00:12:02,020  -->  00:12:05,853
All we have to do is to use the fill property.
277

277

00:12:06,722  -->  00:12:08,545
So, fill and that's it.
278

278

00:12:08,545  -->  00:12:11,016
Now we can specify our color.
279

279

00:12:11,016  -->  00:12:13,895
And the one that I want is this dark gray here,
280

280

00:12:13,895  -->  00:12:15,312
the number three.
281

281

00:12:19,689  -->  00:12:21,142
And that's actually it.
282

282

00:12:21,142  -->  00:12:25,301
Let's just remove here this background color
283

283

00:12:25,301  -->  00:12:29,025
and then this component will be completely ready.
284

284

00:12:29,025  -->  00:12:32,032
Okay, let's just compare it to this one.
285

285

00:12:32,032  -->  00:12:33,692
Well, this is actually a bit different
286

286

00:12:33,692  -->  00:12:37,149
because the text is bigger here, and lighter,
287

287

00:12:37,149  -->  00:12:39,184
and so we should change that as well.
288

288

00:12:39,184  -->  00:12:41,991
So, basically the placeholder here has a lighter text,
289

289

00:12:41,991  -->  00:12:44,977
then when we start typing, it becomes the dark text
290

290

00:12:44,977  -->  00:12:47,310
that we have in our example.
291

291

00:12:48,343  -->  00:12:49,398
Right?
292

292

00:12:49,398  -->  00:12:51,339
So, what we have to do here is
293

293

00:12:51,339  -->  00:12:53,917
to change the placeholder text.
294

294

00:12:53,917  -->  00:12:55,182
So, let's do that.
295

295

00:12:55,182  -->  00:12:56,015
So, input.
296

296

00:12:57,968  -->  00:12:59,768
And then remember, what we want is
297

297

00:12:59,768  -->  00:13:02,763
the webkit-input-placeholder pseudo-element.
298

298

00:13:02,763  -->  00:13:03,596
So, webkit
299

299

00:13:06,618  -->  00:13:07,451
input
300

300

00:13:09,799  -->  00:13:10,632
placeholder.
301

301

00:13:10,632  -->  00:13:13,490
Meaning that this only works in WebKit right now.
302

302

00:13:13,490  -->  00:13:16,496
Which are the Chrome and Safari browsers.
303

303

00:13:16,496  -->  00:13:19,663
So, we want a font-weight of 100 only,
304

304

00:13:21,014  -->  00:13:23,764
and a color of a light gray four.
305

305

00:13:27,937  -->  00:13:28,770
Okay?
306

306

00:13:28,770  -->  00:13:29,603
And now, just remember
307

307

00:13:29,603  -->  00:13:33,178
that we put the font size here to inherit.
308

308

00:13:33,178  -->  00:13:35,430
And so, it inherits the global font size,
309

309

00:13:35,430  -->  00:13:38,426
which is 10 pixels, remember, so one rem.
310

310

00:13:38,426  -->  00:13:39,991
But that's quite small, actually,
311

311

00:13:39,991  -->  00:13:44,637
and so let's set a default font size here on the header.
312

312

00:13:44,637  -->  00:13:46,181
Okay, so let's go to the header
313

313

00:13:46,181  -->  00:13:47,621
and set a font size here.
314

314

00:13:47,621  -->  00:13:50,721
And then it will inherit the font size
315

315

00:13:50,721  -->  00:13:52,294
from this parent component.
316

316

00:13:52,294  -->  00:13:56,929
So, let's set it to 14 pixels here, so 1.4 rem,
317

317

00:13:56,929  -->  00:13:58,949
and then check it out again.
318

318

00:13:58,949  -->  00:14:00,516
And yeah, that's much better.
319

319

00:14:00,516  -->  00:14:04,812
Now that looks a lot like our original, right?
320

320

00:14:04,812  -->  00:14:06,820
So this one here.
321

321

00:14:06,820  -->  00:14:08,574
So, that was some great progress.
322

322

00:14:08,574  -->  00:14:11,393
You used a lot more Flexbox in this lecture
323

323

00:14:11,393  -->  00:14:14,239
to align these smaller elements here in this component,
324

324

00:14:14,239  -->  00:14:17,479
and also over in this header here, right?
325

325

00:14:17,479  -->  00:14:21,368
So, Flexbox is perfect for this small kind of situations
326

326

00:14:21,368  -->  00:14:23,435
where you have to do some simple alignments.
327

327

00:14:23,435  -->  00:14:26,546
So, instead of messing with margins and translates,
328

328

00:14:26,546  -->  00:14:29,274
and floats, and text-align center, and all of that stuff,
329

329

00:14:29,274  -->  00:14:32,640
we just use Flexbox, and it's perfect for that.
330

330

00:14:32,640  -->  00:14:34,394
Now, next up, we need to fix
331

331

00:14:34,394  -->  00:14:36,100
this user navigation here, of course,
332

332

00:14:36,100  -->  00:14:38,063
but I'm leaving that to the next lecture
333

333

00:14:38,063  -->  00:14:40,176
so that you can take a break right now
334

334

00:14:40,176  -->  00:14:41,860
and then come back to the next lecture
335

335

00:14:41,860  -->  00:14:43,860
once you're ready to go.
