<v Instructor>Hello and welcome to building</v>
2

2

00:00:03.027  -->  00:00:05.873
the very last part of the Natours Project
3

3

00:00:05.873  -->  00:00:09.371
and that is the popup that I showed you before.
4

4

00:00:09.371  -->  00:00:12.460
So in this lecture you'll learn how to build a nice popup
5

5

00:00:12.460  -->  00:00:15.436
with only CSS, and this time we're not using
6

6

00:00:15.436  -->  00:00:18.241
the checkbox hack for that functionality,
7

7

00:00:18.241  -->  00:00:21.452
but instead we're using the target pseudo-class.
8

8

00:00:21.452  -->  00:00:24.388
But with this popup component, I don't only want to show you
9

9

00:00:24.388  -->  00:00:26.907
how this actually works, but I'll also teach you
10

10

00:00:26.907  -->  00:00:28.932
how to create boxes with equal height
11

11

00:00:28.932  -->  00:00:31.698
using display set to table-cell.
12

12

00:00:31.698  -->  00:00:35.066
Plus I want to give you some tools for text formatting
13

13

00:00:35.066  -->  00:00:38.192
like creating column layouts and automatic hyphenation
14

14

00:00:38.192  -->  00:00:42.057
of words using the new hyphens property.
15

15

00:00:42.057  -->  00:00:44.044
Let's start by taking a detailed look
16

16

00:00:44.044  -->  00:00:45.873
how this popup actually works.
17

17

00:00:45.873  -->  00:00:48.290
So you open the popup by clicking on one of these
18

18

00:00:48.290  -->  00:00:52.370
Book Now buttons here that appears on one of these cards.
19

19

00:00:52.370  -->  00:00:55.341
Okay, so when we hit, we see that the background here
20

20

00:00:55.341  -->  00:00:58.557
basically becomes dark, right,
21

21

00:00:58.557  -->  00:01:02.106
and we also see then this box here basically coming in
22

22

00:01:02.106  -->  00:01:03.824
so with a nice animation.
23

23

00:01:03.824  -->  00:01:07.666
And of course, all of this is on top of the entire webpage
24

24

00:01:07.666  -->  00:01:09.711
so even off the navigation button.
25

25

00:01:09.711  -->  00:01:10.907
You can maybe see it here.
26

26

00:01:10.907  -->  00:01:13.669
It's hidden behind this complete popup.
27

27

00:01:13.669  -->  00:01:15.812
And also this is at a complete fixed position,
28

28

00:01:15.812  -->  00:01:17.958
so we can scroll and maybe you can see that
29

29

00:01:17.958  -->  00:01:19.565
as well in the background.
30

30

00:01:19.565  -->  00:01:21.624
All right, so I'm scrolling up and down,
31

31

00:01:21.624  -->  00:01:24.627
but this popup here stays in the same place.
32

32

00:01:24.627  -->  00:01:28.257
So we have an element which fills this entire part here
33

33

00:01:28.257  -->  00:01:31.265
so the entire viewport, and then in there we have
34

34

00:01:31.265  -->  00:01:33.742
this box here which is a popup itself.
35

35

00:01:33.742  -->  00:01:38.551
Okay, so let's start by coding that up in our HTML.
36

36

00:01:38.551  -->  00:01:41.631
And we can actually put this wherever we want on a markup
37

37

00:01:41.631  -->  00:01:43.323
because it's not really tied
38

38

00:01:43.323  -->  00:01:45.960
to any of the sections or anything.
39

39

00:01:45.960  -->  00:01:50.064
So let's just put it here really at the end of everything,
40

40

00:01:50.064  -->  00:01:53.446
so even after the footer, let's say.
41

41

00:01:53.446  -->  00:01:57.613
And so it's just a div, and I'm gonna call it popup.
42

42

00:01:59.746  -->  00:02:02.171
And so that is for that dark background,
43

43

00:02:02.171  -->  00:02:06.041
and then in there we have the box itself.
44

44

00:02:06.041  -->  00:02:09.583
So popup and let's call it content,
45

45

00:02:09.583  -->  00:02:12.333
so it's the content of our popup.
46

46

00:02:13.296  -->  00:02:15.768
All right, let's write in popup here
47

47

00:02:15.768  -->  00:02:17.787
because for now we're gonna leave this one empty,
48

48

00:02:17.787  -->  00:02:19.518
and we'll just focus on styling
49

49

00:02:19.518  -->  00:02:21.827
that background and that box,
50

50

00:02:21.827  -->  00:02:25.041
so in order to make it look exactly like this.
51

51

00:02:25.041  -->  00:02:27.141
And that is actually the challenge that I have for you.
52

52

00:02:27.141  -->  00:02:30.148
I want you to style this background and then position this
53

53

00:02:30.148  -->  00:02:32.991
white box here exactly where it is right now.
54

54

00:02:32.991  -->  00:02:35.047
And as you can imagine, it will always stay here
55

55

00:02:35.047  -->  00:02:39.344
nicely centered, so no matter what we do with the viewport,
56

56

00:02:39.344  -->  00:02:41.768
it always stays nicely centered.
57

57

00:02:41.768  -->  00:02:44.646
And so I want you to code that in CSS.
58

58

00:02:44.646  -->  00:02:47.313
Pause the video now and do that.
59

59

00:02:48.304  -->  00:02:50.221
Hopefully you did that.
60

60

00:02:51.100  -->  00:02:54.222
So let me do it right now in order to show you.
61

61

00:02:54.222  -->  00:02:56.612
I create a New File here, and this is, I think,
62

62

00:02:56.612  -->  00:02:58.713
the last file that we're ever gonna create
63

63

00:02:58.713  -->  00:03:01.019
so that's good, right,
64

64

00:03:01.019  -->  00:03:03.102
so popup-scss, of course.
65

65

00:03:08.889  -->  00:03:11.472
And don't forget it to include.
66

66

00:03:15.738  -->  00:03:18.745
All right, close it and here we go.
67

67

00:03:18.745  -->  00:03:21.912
So popup and we also want the content.
68

68

00:03:26.734  -->  00:03:30.854
The height should be 100, viewport height, right,
69

69

00:03:30.854  -->  00:03:32.335
so 100% of the height.
70

70

00:03:32.335  -->  00:03:36.100
The width should be 100% which is actually maybe
71

71

00:03:36.100  -->  00:03:38.570
not really necessary, but let's keep it here.
72

72

00:03:38.570  -->  00:03:41.319
It's not a problem of having one line of redundant CSS.
73

73

00:03:41.319  -->  00:03:43.507
Okay, so let's keep this here.
74

74

00:03:43.507  -->  00:03:48.230
Then as you know, the position is, well, it is fixed,
75

75

00:03:48.230  -->  00:03:50.083
so it doesn't move as we scroll.
76

76

00:03:50.083  -->  00:03:52.671
And then we can use top and left and all that stuff
77

77

00:03:52.671  -->  00:03:56.421
in order to position it, top zero, left zero.
78

78

00:03:57.483  -->  00:04:01.685
Just like absolute positioning, it's taken out of the flow.
79

79

00:04:01.685  -->  00:04:05.393
Now the background-color, let's make it
80

80

00:04:05.393  -->  00:04:08.472
a slightly transparent black.
81

81

00:04:08.472  -->  00:04:11.389
So color-black, let's say 80%.
82

82

00:04:14.500  -->  00:04:17.583
Okay, so that should now occupy the entire viewport.
83

83

00:04:17.583  -->  00:04:21.750
Let's take just a look at that, and yeah, so here we go.
84

84

00:04:23.191  -->  00:04:25.623
Well, actually not really what we want
85

85

00:04:25.623  -->  00:04:28.388
because it's still here on top of this button.
86

86

00:04:28.388  -->  00:04:32.376
So we give it a really high z-index in order to fix that,
87

87

00:04:32.376  -->  00:04:36.043
so something like this and that should help.
88

88

00:04:37.775  -->  00:04:40.460
All right, you see, so now it's really on top
89

89

00:04:40.460  -->  00:04:42.043
of the entire page.
90

90

00:04:44.521  -->  00:04:46.950
And now as for the content, let's start by giving it
91

91

00:04:46.950  -->  00:04:49.450
a width of let's say 75%,
92

92

00:04:53.238  -->  00:04:56.788
so it's gonna occupy always 75% of the container
93

93

00:04:56.788  -->  00:04:59.423
and therefore of the viewport as well.
94

94

00:04:59.423  -->  00:05:02.717
Let's give it a nice background-color
95

95

00:05:02.717  -->  00:05:04.037
and actually not really nice,
96

96

00:05:04.037  -->  00:05:07.984
it's just white, okay, so color-white,
97

97

00:05:07.984  -->  00:05:10.130
And actually I will also give it a height here,
98

98

00:05:10.130  -->  00:05:12.759
but only for testing purposes.
99

99

00:05:12.759  -->  00:05:15.100
We did that before and so let's do it again.
100

100

00:05:15.100  -->  00:05:18.688
So 50rem here again, and I'm gonna get rid of that later.
101

101

00:05:18.688  -->  00:05:21.855
Also we want some box-shadow, so zero,
102

102

00:05:23.613  -->  00:05:26.696
let's say 2rem and four for the blur,
103

103

00:05:30.126  -->  00:05:33.626
and of course, color-black, let's say 0.2.
104

104

00:05:35.741  -->  00:05:37.673
Okay, and now the positioning of this element
105

105

00:05:37.673  -->  00:05:39.072
inside of the popup.
106

106

00:05:39.072  -->  00:05:42.322
Well, once again, we're using absolute positioning here.
107

107

00:05:42.322  -->  00:05:45.311
Now this time let me actually create a mix in here
108

108

00:05:45.311  -->  00:05:49.717
because I'm a bit tired of always writing this out.
109

109

00:05:49.717  -->  00:05:52.395
And so you should do the same, maybe you already did
110

110

00:05:52.395  -->  00:05:55.562
because I've talked about this before.
111

111

00:05:56.550  -->  00:05:59.919
I'm gonna call this one absolute center.
112

112

00:05:59.919  -->  00:06:02.983
And so all that's gonna do is to simply add
113

113

00:06:02.983  -->  00:06:05.650
position absolute, top 50%,
114

114

00:06:09.413  -->  00:06:12.163
left 50%, and then transform
115

115

00:06:14.645  -->  00:06:18.728
translate(-50%, -50%).
116

116

00:06:20.767  -->  00:06:22.908
And so now we have this reusable piece of code
117

117

00:06:22.908  -->  00:06:26.118
that we can now insert here wherever we want.
118

118

00:06:26.118  -->  00:06:29.286
I like to do that at the beginning actually,
119

119

00:06:29.286  -->  00:06:31.036
so include absCenter,
120

120

00:06:32.688  -->  00:06:35.116
so that stands for absolute center.
121

121

00:06:35.116  -->  00:06:37.832
Now I could go ahead and open up all of these files
122

122

00:06:37.832  -->  00:06:40.182
and replace all of this code in each time
123

123

00:06:40.182  -->  00:06:42.846
where we have used it, but I'm not gonna do that
124

124

00:06:42.846  -->  00:06:45.308
in order not to waste your time.
125

125

00:06:45.308  -->  00:06:47.820
But for you, I think it's something that you should do
126

126

00:06:47.820  -->  00:06:51.983
in order to make your code look a bit cleaner.
127

127

00:06:51.983  -->  00:06:55.725
So let's now take a look at that, and alright,
128

128

00:06:55.725  -->  00:06:57.669
so that looks pretty good already, right.
129

129

00:06:57.669  -->  00:07:00.798
It's pretty similar already to what we have in our original.
130

130

00:07:00.798  -->  00:07:02.774
Just some rounded corners here missing,
131

131

00:07:02.774  -->  00:07:05.461
but beside that we're good to go.
132

132

00:07:05.461  -->  00:07:06.940
So what's next here?
133

133

00:07:06.940  -->  00:07:09.534
Well, we have basically this left side here
134

134

00:07:09.534  -->  00:07:13.242
with these two images and then the right side with this text
135

135

00:07:13.242  -->  00:07:15.921
and this button and this h2 element here.
136

136

00:07:15.921  -->  00:07:18.559
And on this right side, like this right panel here,
137

137

00:07:18.559  -->  00:07:21.401
we have this entire content like vertically centered
138

138

00:07:21.401  -->  00:07:22.803
and that is because these boxes here,
139

139

00:07:22.803  -->  00:07:23.955
they're actually the same size.
140

140

00:07:23.955  -->  00:07:26.418
So this here is a box and this one is a box
141

141

00:07:26.418  -->  00:07:28.108
and they have the same height.
142

142

00:07:28.108  -->  00:07:29.651
And so I told you before that that's something
143

143

00:07:29.651  -->  00:07:31.689
that I want to show you so how to make
144

144

00:07:31.689  -->  00:07:33.296
two boxes side by side
145

145

00:07:33.296  -->  00:07:35.231
having automatically the same height.
146

146

00:07:35.231  -->  00:07:36.840
So that can be very useful sometimes,
147

147

00:07:36.840  -->  00:07:39.396
and it's something I haven't showed you up until this point
148

148

00:07:39.396  -->  00:07:43.109
so let's create this content in here.
149

149

00:07:43.109  -->  00:07:45.954
But first these rounded corners that we were missing,
150

150

00:07:45.954  -->  00:07:47.787
so border-radius: 3px.
151

151

00:07:50.241  -->  00:07:54.074
All right, now coming back to this popup here,
152

152

00:07:56.003  -->  00:08:00.170
I'm gonna call this one popup simply for the left side
153

153

00:08:01.442  -->  00:08:04.692
and then for the right side, of course.
154

154

00:08:06.062  -->  00:08:09.979
Okay, so in here we have some pictures, so img.
155

155

00:08:11.711  -->  00:08:13.878
Then img/nat-8,
156

156

00:08:16.729  -->  00:08:19.229
and it is simply a Tour photo.
157

157

00:08:21.718  -->  00:08:25.801
And again and this time it's img/nat-9
158

158

00:08:28.431  -->  00:08:30.348
and another Tour photo.
159

159

00:08:32.579  -->  00:08:34.816
Also I should give them a class,
160

160

00:08:34.816  -->  00:08:35.899
so popup_img.
161

161

00:08:43.305  -->  00:08:47.456
And as for the left side, we want a heading secondary here.
162

162

00:08:47.456  -->  00:08:50.123
So it's an h2.heading-secondary,
163

163

00:08:53.152  -->  00:08:56.152
and this one says Start booking now.
164

164

00:08:57.929  -->  00:09:00.522
Then below that we actually have an h3,
165

165

00:09:00.522  -->  00:09:03.439
so that we called heading-tertiary,
166

166

00:09:08.694  -->  00:09:12.283
Important, then using like a long dash
167

167

00:09:12.283  -->  00:09:13.756
and it's something that I like to use,
168

168

00:09:13.756  -->  00:09:15.549
so I'm gonna show it to you.
169

169

00:09:15.549  -->  00:09:17.444
This is another one of these HTML entities
170

170

00:09:17.444  -->  00:09:19.258
that I use all the time.
171

171

00:09:19.258  -->  00:09:22.185
And enter something like, Please read
172

172

00:09:22.185  -->  00:09:24.435
these terms before booking.
173

173

00:09:27.055  -->  00:09:29.221
Now in a real life scenario, it would probably
174

174

00:09:29.221  -->  00:09:31.569
not be a good idea to ask the client to first
175

175

00:09:31.569  -->  00:09:34.184
read the terms before booking, but in this page here,
176

176

00:09:34.184  -->  00:09:36.610
we're not really worried about that kind of stuff.
177

177

00:09:36.610  -->  00:09:38.340
I just created these parts of the websites
178

178

00:09:38.340  -->  00:09:40.354
and these features in order to show you
179

179

00:09:40.354  -->  00:09:43.019
all of these CSS features.
180

180

00:09:43.019  -->  00:09:45.777
Don't just copy what I have done on this webpage.
181

181

00:09:45.777  -->  00:09:48.288
It's not optimized for conversions
182

182

00:09:48.288  -->  00:09:50.144
or for anything like that.
183

183

00:09:50.144  -->  00:09:53.933
This is just to show you these CSS features again.
184

184

00:09:53.933  -->  00:09:57.050
All right, and finally just some popup_text
185

185

00:09:57.050  -->  00:09:58.701
here in a paragraph.
186

186

00:09:58.701  -->  00:10:02.077
All right, now let's get some text here from one
187

187

00:10:02.077  -->  00:10:03.966
of these Lorem Ipsum generators
188

188

00:10:03.966  -->  00:10:05.488
that I've already opened here.
189

189

00:10:05.488  -->  00:10:09.648
I think I've showed you this one before.
190

190

00:10:09.648  -->  00:10:11.080
And I'll just say that I want it
191

191

00:10:11.080  -->  00:10:14.539
to generate one paragraph for me.
192

192

00:10:14.539  -->  00:10:18.706
So here we go, and I copy all of it and paste it here.
193

193

00:10:21.033  -->  00:10:24.450
All right, so that's a long line of text.
194

194

00:10:29.113  -->  00:10:31.869
Now actually I want a button here.
195

195

00:10:31.869  -->  00:10:33.536
So a.btn.btn__green,
196

196

00:10:37.720  -->  00:10:41.061
pointing to nowhere at least for now.
197

197

00:10:41.061  -->  00:10:42.561
Okay, so Book now.
198

198

00:10:44.518  -->  00:10:46.374
All right, so let's now format these,
199

199

00:10:46.374  -->  00:10:49.041
so left, right, image, and text.
200

200

00:10:56.325  -->  00:10:57.325
Left, right,
201

201

00:11:04.085  -->  00:11:05.252
img, and text.
202

202

00:11:08.658  -->  00:11:10.718
Let's actually start with the images because otherwise
203

203

00:11:10.718  -->  00:11:12.813
they will occupy a lot of space
204

204

00:11:12.813  -->  00:11:16.066
and then we cannot see what's going on.
205

205

00:11:16.066  -->  00:11:19.983
I want these images to be displayed as a block.
206

206

00:11:21.798  -->  00:11:24.232
That's usually a good idea to do,
207

207

00:11:24.232  -->  00:11:28.399
and then I want them to have a width of 100%,
208

208

00:11:29.460  -->  00:11:33.365
so entirely their entire parent container's width.
209

209

00:11:33.365  -->  00:11:35.140
Now another thing that I should actually do here already
210

210

00:11:35.140  -->  00:11:37.446
is getting rid of this height.
211

211

00:11:37.446  -->  00:11:41.487
Remember it was just for testing purposes and so yeah.
212

212

00:11:41.487  -->  00:11:46.065
Now the left part here, we want it to have a width of 1/3,
213

213

00:11:46.065  -->  00:11:48.482
so basically 33.333333%.
214

214

00:11:51.173  -->  00:11:53.930
And it's not an exaggeration to put such a high amount
215

215

00:11:53.930  -->  00:11:56.512
of these numbers here after the comma,
216

216

00:11:56.512  -->  00:11:58.679
so we can totally do that.
217

217

00:11:59.890  -->  00:12:03.058
And so this one should be the remainder of that,
218

218

00:12:03.058  -->  00:12:05.308
so 66.6666667, for example.
219

219

00:12:08.577  -->  00:12:12.532
Six would also be okay, so it's not really important here.
220

220

00:12:12.532  -->  00:12:17.092
But notice that these two roughly together make 100%.
221

221

00:12:17.092  -->  00:12:18.001
Let's take a look at that.
222

222

00:12:18.001  -->  00:12:20.146
Of course, it will not be really good
223

223

00:12:20.146  -->  00:12:22.373
because now we want these side by side.
224

224

00:12:22.373  -->  00:12:24.967
And the first thing that comes to mind for doing that
225

225

00:12:24.967  -->  00:12:27.115
is to actually use float.
226

226

00:12:27.115  -->  00:12:31.282
So let me start by showing that to you, so float left
227

227

00:12:33.909  -->  00:12:35.721
and float left.
228

228

00:12:35.721  -->  00:12:37.367
It could be right as well, but it doesn't really matter
229

229

00:12:37.367  -->  00:12:40.089
because they have 100% together anyway,
230

230

00:12:40.089  -->  00:12:41.922
so it's not different.
231

231

00:12:43.530  -->  00:12:46.701
Okay, and now they are side by side such as we wanted.
232

232

00:12:46.701  -->  00:12:48.840
But let me show you the small problem with that.
233

233

00:12:48.840  -->  00:12:50.813
It's not really a big problem,
234

234

00:12:50.813  -->  00:12:53.198
but you see here that this left element has
235

235

00:12:53.198  -->  00:12:56.243
this entire height, and then the right one only has
236

236

00:12:56.243  -->  00:12:58.874
this height, of course, because that's the space
237

237

00:12:58.874  -->  00:13:00.316
that it occupies.
238

238

00:13:00.316  -->  00:13:02.049
That's completely normal behavior.
239

239

00:13:02.049  -->  00:13:04.148
Now what we want here is that these boxes
240

240

00:13:04.148  -->  00:13:07.117
actually have the same height because then it's easier
241

241

00:13:07.117  -->  00:13:10.205
to center this content here vertically in the middle
242

242

00:13:10.205  -->  00:13:12.549
of all of this white space here.
243

243

00:13:12.549  -->  00:13:15.145
And so sometimes that's a very useful thing to do
244

244

00:13:15.145  -->  00:13:19.596
and a very useful technique that I'm gonna show you.
245

245

00:13:19.596  -->  00:13:22.481
Let me actually show you how to do that.
246

246

00:13:22.481  -->  00:13:26.104
It's not using floats, but instead
247

247

00:13:26.104  -->  00:13:28.619
we're gonna simulate a table.
248

248

00:13:28.619  -->  00:13:29.812
And so we set the display property
249

249

00:13:29.812  -->  00:13:32.395
on this one here to table-cell,
250

250

00:13:34.460  -->  00:13:36.043
so on both of them,
251

251

00:13:37.099  -->  00:13:38.682
display table-cell.
252

252

00:13:40.886  -->  00:13:44.956
And then the parent element which is, remember, the content,
253

253

00:13:44.956  -->  00:13:49.123
so this one here, we set this one to display table.
254

254

00:13:51.741  -->  00:13:54.253
This one functions as a table, the content,
255

255

00:13:54.253  -->  00:13:57.303
and then the left and the right they are both table cells.
256

256

00:13:57.303  -->  00:13:58.701
And then the browser will automatically
257

257

00:13:58.701  -->  00:14:01.658
give them the same height.
258

258

00:14:01.658  -->  00:14:03.837
Let's take a look at that.
259

259

00:14:03.837  -->  00:14:07.337
And well, for now it still looks the same.
260

260

00:14:11.206  -->  00:14:15.642
So content left and right, but you see that they
261

261

00:14:15.642  -->  00:14:19.145
now both basically here have the same height.
262

262

00:14:19.145  -->  00:14:22.982
And now all that's left to do is to use a property
263

263

00:14:22.982  -->  00:14:26.652
that we can use on tables or on table cells actually
264

264

00:14:26.652  -->  00:14:30.069
and this is called vertical-align middle.
265

265

00:14:35.038  -->  00:14:38.164
Let's take a look at that now, and here we go.
266

266

00:14:38.164  -->  00:14:41.908
Now we have two table cells basically where this one here
267

267

00:14:41.908  -->  00:14:44.991
has its content aligned in the middle
268

268

00:14:45.883  -->  00:14:48.716
of the other table cell basically.
269

269

00:14:51.229  -->  00:14:53.207
Let's take a look at that here.
270

270

00:14:53.207  -->  00:14:57.368
All right, and so the height is actually still only 542,
271

271

00:14:57.368  -->  00:14:59.843
so only this blue box that you see here.
272

272

00:14:59.843  -->  00:15:02.431
And so technically they do not have the same height,
273

273

00:15:02.431  -->  00:15:04.947
but we can consider that they do because when we use
274

274

00:15:04.947  -->  00:15:09.429
this vertical align then, they nicely align here like this.
275

275

00:15:09.429  -->  00:15:12.888
And of course, there are others instead of middle,
276

276

00:15:12.888  -->  00:15:17.087
there is like top, and so it works the same,
277

277

00:15:17.087  -->  00:15:21.981
and also bottom, I believe, yeah, and so we can do this
278

278

00:15:21.981  -->  00:15:25.357
kind of thing basically by faking that this is a table.
279

279

00:15:25.357  -->  00:15:27.206
Because if it was a real table we would have to use
280

280

00:15:27.206  -->  00:15:29.270
the HTML elements for all of that.
281

281

00:15:29.270  -->  00:15:31.869
But by setting it using the display property,
282

282

00:15:31.869  -->  00:15:35.124
we are basically faking and saying that this is a table
283

283

00:15:35.124  -->  00:15:37.041
while in fact it's not.
284

284

00:15:37.881  -->  00:15:39.647
So let's continuing now formatting this,
285

285

00:15:39.647  -->  00:15:41.790
giving it here some nice padding.
286

286

00:15:41.790  -->  00:15:43.723
Actually this is misspelled here.
287

287

00:15:43.723  -->  00:15:46.191
And another thing that I'm seeing here is that these images
288

288

00:15:46.191  -->  00:15:48.953
here overlap the border radius that we gave here,
289

289

00:15:48.953  -->  00:15:53.685
this one here, right, and so let's fix that as well.
290

290

00:15:53.685  -->  00:15:55.254
Do you remember how we do that
291

291

00:15:55.254  -->  00:15:57.398
with the image overlapping the border?
292

292

00:15:57.398  -->  00:16:00.531
Well, we did it before and it's not really difficult.
293

293

00:16:00.531  -->  00:16:03.382
All we have to do is come to the content here and say
294

294

00:16:03.382  -->  00:16:07.577
overflow hidden, and so that part of the image
295

295

00:16:07.577  -->  00:16:11.816
which is overflowing this box will not be visible anymore.
296

296

00:16:11.816  -->  00:16:14.289
And yup, maybe you saw it changing here,
297

297

00:16:14.289  -->  00:16:17.167
and so now it's gone and it works just fine.
298

298

00:16:17.167  -->  00:16:21.334
All right, now about the padding here in this right thing,
299

299

00:16:23.755  -->  00:16:27.922
some padding at the top and then on the side some more,
300

300

00:16:29.398  -->  00:16:30.924
so 5rem in here.
301

301

00:16:30.924  -->  00:16:31.966
Then about the text, let's give it
302

302

00:16:31.966  -->  00:16:34.883
some font size of 1.4 only, 1.4rem,
303

303

00:16:37.257  -->  00:16:40.427
and also a margin at the bottom in order to create
304

304

00:16:40.427  -->  00:16:44.010
that space between the bottom and the text.
305

305

00:16:44.919  -->  00:16:47.586
Just making the word look right,
306

306

00:16:49.283  -->  00:16:50.783
and so here we go.
307

307

00:16:51.919  -->  00:16:53.403
That looks pretty nice already.
308

308

00:16:53.403  -->  00:16:56.203
Let's just add some more spacing here to these two
309

309

00:16:56.203  -->  00:16:59.661
and for that we can use more helper classes.
310

310

00:16:59.661  -->  00:17:02.092
So margin-bottom and I'm gonna use the small
311

311

00:17:02.092  -->  00:17:03.675
and the medium one.
312

312

00:17:07.488  -->  00:17:10.124
For the secondary heading we can add it in here,
313

313

00:17:10.124  -->  00:17:13.041
the medium one and then here small.
314

314

00:17:14.569  -->  00:17:15.969
So that should look better.
315

315

00:17:15.969  -->  00:17:19.883
Or maybe, well maybe not, we can put the small one here
316

316

00:17:19.883  -->  00:17:23.714
as well and now it looks more consistent.
317

317

00:17:23.714  -->  00:17:26.291
Now one last piece missing here in the puzzle to make it
318

318

00:17:26.291  -->  00:17:29.208
look like this one, so where is it,
319

319

00:17:30.572  -->  00:17:32.591
to make it look a bit more like this one,
320

320

00:17:32.591  -->  00:17:35.598
is these columns that we have here and also this
321

321

00:17:35.598  -->  00:17:38.195
automatic hyphenation that I mentioned in the beginning.
322

322

00:17:38.195  -->  00:17:40.584
So you have a word and then here there's not enough space
323

323

00:17:40.584  -->  00:17:42.190
for it, and so there's a hyphen
324

324

00:17:42.190  -->  00:17:44.248
and it continues on the next line.
325

325

00:17:44.248  -->  00:17:47.133
And actually if you select it, it selects both parts,
326

326

00:17:47.133  -->  00:17:48.899
so that's really nice as well.
327

327

00:17:48.899  -->  00:17:53.017
If we decrease this here, then we see that even more
328

328

00:17:53.017  -->  00:17:55.695
hyphens start to pop up as we have less and less space
329

329

00:17:55.695  -->  00:17:58.167
to fit the content here.
330

330

00:17:58.167  -->  00:18:01.381
That's a very nice and new feature in CSS,
331

331

00:18:01.381  -->  00:18:04.964
and so let us take a look at that actually.
332

332

00:18:06.240  -->  00:18:10.320
Back to our CSS and let's start with the columns.
333

333

00:18:10.320  -->  00:18:13.661
Column layout is something really new in CSS,
334

334

00:18:13.661  -->  00:18:15.763
but we can make it work in most
335

335

00:18:15.763  -->  00:18:17.785
of the modern browsers already.
336

336

00:18:17.785  -->  00:18:19.661
All we have to do is to specify
337

337

00:18:19.661  -->  00:18:22.244
a property called column-count.
338

338

00:18:23.655  -->  00:18:25.609
We say that you want two columns
339

339

00:18:25.609  -->  00:18:27.300
and so that's all we have to do.
340

340

00:18:27.300  -->  00:18:30.797
And with this, it will automatically create two columns.
341

341

00:18:30.797  -->  00:18:33.147
Now there are some more details that we can do here
342

342

00:18:33.147  -->  00:18:36.064
which is column-gap, and so in here
343

343

00:18:37.701  -->  00:18:42.062
we can specify the space that we want between the columns.
344

344

00:18:42.062  -->  00:18:43.931
And the default here is is one em,
345

345

00:18:43.931  -->  00:18:47.764
but we want it to be a little bigger here.
346

346

00:18:47.764  -->  00:18:50.887
Just for curiosity, what would be one em here
347

347

00:18:50.887  -->  00:18:52.907
in this specific case?
348

348

00:18:52.907  -->  00:18:53.982
Can you think about that?
349

349

00:18:53.982  -->  00:18:56.572
What would be the default for the column gap
350

350

00:18:56.572  -->  00:18:58.092
if that's one em?
351

351

00:18:58.092  -->  00:18:59.735
And I hope you guessed it right.
352

352

00:18:59.735  -->  00:19:02.568
It would be 1em = 14px, okay.
353

353

00:19:03.901  -->  00:19:04.847
And why is that?
354

354

00:19:04.847  -->  00:19:07.925
Well, because one em is always the font size
355

355

00:19:07.925  -->  00:19:10.108
of the current element.
356

356

00:19:10.108  -->  00:19:12.749
So just as a reminder so you don't forget
357

357

00:19:12.749  -->  00:19:14.642
what this em here actually means.
358

358

00:19:14.642  -->  00:19:17.111
But in this case, we just want to set it to 4rem
359

359

00:19:17.111  -->  00:19:20.821
so that we give it some more breathing space.
360

360

00:19:20.821  -->  00:19:25.100
Then another interesting property here is the column-rule.
361

361

00:19:25.100  -->  00:19:27.690
This is basically just like a border which will be
362

362

00:19:27.690  -->  00:19:30.368
exactly in the middle of these two columns,
363

363

00:19:30.368  -->  00:19:33.459
so the browser will automatically put it there.
364

364

00:19:33.459  -->  00:19:37.950
And so let's put a light color here, so color-grey.
365

365

00:19:37.950  -->  00:19:42.031
Now I don't really remember the color names here,
366

366

00:19:42.031  -->  00:19:45.861
so let's simply put this one here, so the number two.
367

367

00:19:45.861  -->  00:19:47.756
And where is it?
368

368

00:19:47.756  -->  00:19:50.635
Actually we can close this one here and the mixins as well,
369

369

00:19:50.635  -->  00:19:52.492
so color-grey-2 here.
370

370

00:19:52.492  -->  00:19:55.492
All right, so let's take a look now,
371

371

00:19:57.076  -->  00:19:58.803
maybe reload it.
372

372

00:19:58.803  -->  00:20:02.020
And well, nothing happened for some reason.
373

373

00:20:02.020  -->  00:20:04.165
Let's inspect that.
374

374

00:20:04.165  -->  00:20:07.456
So popup text, well it's not really there.
375

375

00:20:07.456  -->  00:20:08.898
Why is that?
376

376

00:20:08.898  -->  00:20:10.668
Well, everything should be okay,
377

377

00:20:10.668  -->  00:20:13.634
so let's try to reload this one more time.
378

378

00:20:13.634  -->  00:20:15.194
For some reason, it's not really there.
379

379

00:20:15.194  -->  00:20:17.135
This looks like maybe there was some kind
380

380

00:20:17.135  -->  00:20:19.552
of error here again and okay.
381

381

00:20:21.087  -->  00:20:23.349
So color-grey-2 does not exist.
382

382

00:20:23.349  -->  00:20:24.921
Why is that?
383

383

00:20:24.921  -->  00:20:27.842
Okay probably I misspelled it.
384

384

00:20:27.842  -->  00:20:30.360
Let's just get it here, copy it.
385

385

00:20:30.360  -->  00:20:33.322
Oh okay, I forgot to call it light.
386

386

00:20:33.322  -->  00:20:35.584
All right, and so usually when something doesn't appear
387

387

00:20:35.584  -->  00:20:38.572
on the page, well, then it's most likely
388

388

00:20:38.572  -->  00:20:40.552
a CSS compilation error.
389

389

00:20:40.552  -->  00:20:43.270
So that happens to us a couple of times now,
390

390

00:20:43.270  -->  00:20:45.671
but now it is finally working.
391

391

00:20:45.671  -->  00:20:47.179
Okay, and so here it is.
392

392

00:20:47.179  -->  00:20:50.230
Here are our two columns and our nice line here
393

393

00:20:50.230  -->  00:20:51.980
separating these two.
394

394

00:20:53.554  -->  00:20:58.004
Let me show you what happens if we decrease the gap.
395

395

00:20:58.004  -->  00:21:00.597
And so at zero, of course, these two sides
396

396

00:21:00.597  -->  00:21:02.514
they are then touching.
397

397

00:21:03.359  -->  00:21:05.599
And we could increase the count, of course.
398

398

00:21:05.599  -->  00:21:08.484
So three columns, four columns, five columns,
399

399

00:21:08.484  -->  00:21:10.665
and so on and so forth.
400

400

00:21:10.665  -->  00:21:13.420
So what you see here is that CSS automatically balances
401

401

00:21:13.420  -->  00:21:14.945
the height here of these columns.
402

402

00:21:14.945  -->  00:21:17.133
You see that in the first column and the second column
403

403

00:21:17.133  -->  00:21:20.054
they have the same height as they still have enough text
404

404

00:21:20.054  -->  00:21:23.639
to display and then the last one here where the text ends.
405

405

00:21:23.639  -->  00:21:26.809
Well, then the rest of the column here is, of course, empty.
406

406

00:21:26.809  -->  00:21:28.084
And if you increase that you will see
407

407

00:21:28.084  -->  00:21:29.816
the same thing happening, so that the text
408

408

00:21:29.816  -->  00:21:33.144
is always nicely distributed here.
409

409

00:21:33.144  -->  00:21:34.751
Now I think we have a bit too much text here
410

410

00:21:34.751  -->  00:21:37.881
so let's get rid of part of that.
411

411

00:21:37.881  -->  00:21:40.881
So this looks a bit weird right now.
412

412

00:21:43.074  -->  00:21:46.074
Maybe this part here, where is that?
413

413

00:21:49.661  -->  00:21:52.338
All right, so that should be better.
414

414

00:21:52.338  -->  00:21:54.359
And now the final thing that we want to do here
415

415

00:21:54.359  -->  00:21:58.526
is the hyphenation, and that one is really easy as well.
416

416

00:21:59.379  -->  00:22:02.799
So hyphens, and then there are three possibilities here.
417

417

00:22:02.799  -->  00:22:05.147
The first one is none which is basically
418

418

00:22:05.147  -->  00:22:07.335
the initial value, so the default.
419

419

00:22:07.335  -->  00:22:10.382
Then we have manual, so we could say manual,
420

420

00:22:10.382  -->  00:22:13.219
but that's not really useful because if we say manual
421

421

00:22:13.219  -->  00:22:16.848
then we can go to our text and automatically specify
422

422

00:22:16.848  -->  00:22:18.866
where we want hyphens to occur.
423

423

00:22:18.866  -->  00:22:20.997
So we can do that then here in our text
424

424

00:22:20.997  -->  00:22:23.678
and specify places where we want that to occur.
425

425

00:22:23.678  -->  00:22:26.149
But I think that's not helpful at all and so I think
426

426

00:22:26.149  -->  00:22:28.915
the only thing that matters here for this hyphens property
427

427

00:22:28.915  -->  00:22:33.463
is to actually use auto, and so it will automatically
428

428

00:22:33.463  -->  00:22:35.772
figure out where to place the hyphens.
429

429

00:22:35.772  -->  00:22:37.582
Now in order for this to work correctly,
430

430

00:22:37.582  -->  00:22:41.244
you have to actually define the document language here.
431

431

00:22:41.244  -->  00:22:45.765
So up here in the html, you have this language attribute
432

432

00:22:45.765  -->  00:22:49.429
and in here just edit to English, if your website is English
433

433

00:22:49.429  -->  00:22:51.610
into your language if it's not.
434

434

00:22:51.610  -->  00:22:53.123
You can just Google the code that you have
435

435

00:22:53.123  -->  00:22:55.623
to put here for your language.
436

436

00:22:57.853  -->  00:22:59.536
Now in this case, it's not really English,
437

437

00:22:59.536  -->  00:23:01.228
this is probably Latin or something,
438

438

00:23:01.228  -->  00:23:04.239
but you see that the hyphens are already working.
439

439

00:23:04.239  -->  00:23:07.105
So they are here in this word and this and this one
440

440

00:23:07.105  -->  00:23:10.302
and so yeah, so this is working already.
441

441

00:23:10.302  -->  00:23:12.402
And these two properties together, so the columns
442

442

00:23:12.402  -->  00:23:15.044
and the hyphens, this allows us to get closer
443

443

00:23:15.044  -->  00:23:18.668
to the traditional print designs like a magazine layout
444

444

00:23:18.668  -->  00:23:20.562
or a real newspaper.
445

445

00:23:20.562  -->  00:23:24.359
And so that's why these properties were introduced.
446

446

00:23:24.359  -->  00:23:26.160
And you see that it also nicely changes here
447

447

00:23:26.160  -->  00:23:30.929
the hyphenation, everything as the width changes,
448

448

00:23:30.929  -->  00:23:35.250
and so yeah, this is already nicely responsive actually.
449

449

00:23:35.250  -->  00:23:38.874
Just one thing that I have to tell you in the end
450

450

00:23:38.874  -->  00:23:41.711
is that this actually needs a lot of prefixes
451

451

00:23:41.711  -->  00:23:44.508
in order to work in all the modern browsers.
452

452

00:23:44.508  -->  00:23:48.675
So we should give it a moz prefix, actually copy this.
453

453

00:23:49.788  -->  00:23:51.038
So for Mozilla,
454

454

00:23:54.241  -->  00:23:56.378
for Microsoft, so for Edge,
455

455

00:23:56.378  -->  00:24:00.545
and also for webkit which is basically Chrome and Safari
456

456

00:24:02.062  -->  00:24:03.378
because in some older versions
457

457

00:24:03.378  -->  00:24:05.599
it will not work without this.
458

458

00:24:05.599  -->  00:24:09.557
And actually the same thing here applies to the columns.
459

459

00:24:09.557  -->  00:24:11.390
So here we should have
460

460

00:24:13.877  -->  00:24:16.210
at least the Mozilla prefix.
461

461

00:24:18.984  -->  00:24:23.673
In Mozilla it's not gonna work without this prefix,
462

462

00:24:23.673  -->  00:24:25.070
and so we should add it.
463

463

00:24:25.070  -->  00:24:27.376
Now we are now doing this manually just because I want
464

464

00:24:27.376  -->  00:24:30.136
to show you that you need these prefixes.
465

465

00:24:30.136  -->  00:24:32.605
But in the real life, you should not do it by hand,
466

466

00:24:32.605  -->  00:24:35.480
but instead there are nice tools that you can use
467

467

00:24:35.480  -->  00:24:38.856
in order to do that, and one of them is called Autoprefixer
468

468

00:24:38.856  -->  00:24:40.587
but I'm gonna talk a bit more about that
469

469

00:24:40.587  -->  00:24:42.395
later on in the course.
470

470

00:24:42.395  -->  00:24:45.360
So for now, just remember that usually you shouldn't
471

471

00:24:45.360  -->  00:24:47.536
add the prefixes by yourself.
472

472

00:24:47.536  -->  00:24:49.268
I'm just putting them here now so that you know
473

473

00:24:49.268  -->  00:24:52.438
which property is supported in which browser.
474

474

00:24:52.438  -->  00:24:55.023
All right, and so I think we now have
475

475

00:24:55.023  -->  00:24:57.369
the styling part here complete.
476

476

00:24:57.369  -->  00:24:59.552
And so in the next lecture, let's then take care
477

477

00:24:59.552  -->  00:25:01.444
of the functionality, so basically
478

478

00:25:01.444  -->  00:25:03.837
opening and closing this popup,
479

479

00:25:03.837  -->  00:25:06.148
because that's what's really missing in here.
480

480

00:25:06.148  -->  00:25:09.648
So let's move on now to that next lecture.
