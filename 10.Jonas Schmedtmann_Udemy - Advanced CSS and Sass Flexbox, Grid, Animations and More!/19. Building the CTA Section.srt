00:00:01,044  -->  00:00:02,287
<v Instructor>Finally, we reach the</v>
2

2

00:00:02,287  -->  00:00:04,711
last part of our project, and that's the
3

3

00:00:04,711  -->  00:00:08,530
call to action section with a booking button in it.
4

4

00:00:08,530  -->  00:00:10,135
And so in this lecture, you will learn
5

5

00:00:10,135  -->  00:00:12,607
how to make that button because it has
6

6

00:00:12,607  -->  00:00:16,305
yet another really cool and modern hover effect on it.
7

7

00:00:16,305  -->  00:00:19,052
So let's get back to work.
8

8

00:00:19,052  -->  00:00:21,176
So that here is a call to action section
9

9

00:00:21,176  -->  00:00:22,411
that we're going to code now.
10

10

00:00:22,411  -->  00:00:25,843
So it has this text here, which is an h2 element,
11

11

00:00:25,843  -->  00:00:28,339
and then this button that I was talking about.
12

12

00:00:28,339  -->  00:00:30,859
But let's for now take care of the overall formatting
13

13

00:00:30,859  -->  00:00:34,087
of the section and of this heading element here.
14

14

00:00:34,087  -->  00:00:34,920
Okay?
15

15

00:00:36,223  -->  00:00:40,390
So this here is probably the, well, actually it's not.
16

16

00:00:41,457  -->  00:00:43,290
So this is the detail.
17

17

00:00:44,635  -->  00:00:46,855
And so right here is where we have to put
18

18

00:00:46,855  -->  00:00:49,066
our call to action section.
19

19

00:00:49,066  -->  00:00:53,467
So a div with the CTA class, short for call to action.
20

20

00:00:53,467  -->  00:00:55,867
So in here we have the h2,
21

21

00:00:55,867  -->  00:00:59,034
which I'm going to call cta__book-now,
22

22

00:01:00,811  -->  00:01:04,015
and then the text that's in here is,
23

23

00:01:04,015  -->  00:01:04,932
"Good news!
24

24

00:01:07,159  -->  00:01:11,326
"We have four free rooms for your selected dates!"
25

25

00:01:13,159  -->  00:01:14,359
So just this.
26

26

00:01:14,359  -->  00:01:17,692
And then after that, we have our button,
27

27

00:01:19,283  -->  00:01:22,330
which I'm simply calling btn.
28

28

00:01:22,330  -->  00:01:23,163
All right.
29

29

00:01:23,163  -->  00:01:25,351
And now in here, for now I'm just going to put
30

30

00:01:25,351  -->  00:01:28,268
some text, so only four rooms left,
31

31

00:01:29,576  -->  00:01:31,507
but we're going to have to change that later,
32

32

00:01:31,507  -->  00:01:33,943
and I'm going to explain to you why then.
33

33

00:01:33,943  -->  00:01:38,110
So for now, let's just have format here, or CTA element.
34

34

00:01:41,191  -->  00:01:44,191
So down here, all the way down here,
35

35

00:01:45,367  -->  00:01:47,700
and let's get this one here.
36

36

00:01:51,619  -->  00:01:53,119
So call to action.
37

37

00:01:57,081  -->  00:02:01,248
And I want to start with a padding of 3.5rem top and bottom.
38

38

00:02:02,300  -->  00:02:05,299
And also, let's center the text here.
39

39

00:02:05,299  -->  00:02:07,315
So text align to center, because that will
40

40

00:02:07,315  -->  00:02:11,482
automatically center the h2 element as well as the button.
41

41

00:02:12,674  -->  00:02:13,507
Okay.
42

42

00:02:13,507  -->  00:02:15,981
So let's now format that h2.
43

43

00:02:15,981  -->  00:02:19,814
So book-now, and that one has a text transform
44

44

00:02:23,831  -->  00:02:27,116
of uppercase, and actually let's start
45

45

00:02:27,116  -->  00:02:29,407
with the font size.
46

46

00:02:29,407  -->  00:02:30,240
So 1.2rem.
47

47

00:02:33,430  -->  00:02:35,996
And a font weight of 300.
48

48

00:02:35,996  -->  00:02:39,079
And also margin to the bottom of 2.5.
49

49

00:02:42,458  -->  00:02:43,334
All right.
50

50

00:02:43,334  -->  00:02:44,751
Let's check that.
51

51

00:02:45,743  -->  00:02:47,135
And here we go.
52

52

00:02:47,135  -->  00:02:48,983
Okay, you'll see that everything is centered,
53

53

00:02:48,983  -->  00:02:51,995
and well, of course this text here is way too small.
54

54

00:02:51,995  -->  00:02:53,495
Let's make it 1.5.
55

55

00:02:56,461  -->  00:02:58,019
And so here we go.
56

56

00:02:58,019  -->  00:03:01,547
And now we have to style this button here of course.
57

57

00:03:01,547  -->  00:03:02,819
So how do we do that?
58

58

00:03:02,819  -->  00:03:05,518
And for that let's take a look here at the example,
59

59

00:03:05,518  -->  00:03:08,711
so that I can explain you what's actually going on.
60

60

00:03:08,711  -->  00:03:10,643
So the trick to this here is to
61

61

00:03:10,643  -->  00:03:13,475
basically design the button like this,
62

62

00:03:13,475  -->  00:03:15,599
and then put two elements in there,
63

63

00:03:15,599  -->  00:03:17,914
one that says, "Book Now," okay,
64

64

00:03:17,914  -->  00:03:19,633
so the text that we have here,
65

65

00:03:19,633  -->  00:03:22,763
and then another one that says, "Only 4 rooms left."
66

66

00:03:22,763  -->  00:03:24,515
And as soon as we hover the button,
67

67

00:03:24,515  -->  00:03:27,158
well, they both slide down a little bit.
68

68

00:03:27,158  -->  00:03:30,083
And when we then hover out, of course they move back up.
69

69

00:03:30,083  -->  00:03:31,403
So that's exactly what happens.
70

70

00:03:31,403  -->  00:03:33,324
So take a look.
71

71

00:03:33,324  -->  00:03:34,319
So you saw that.
72

72

00:03:34,319  -->  00:03:35,834
The "Book Now" moves down, and the
73

73

00:03:35,834  -->  00:03:38,375
other text also moves down.
74

74

00:03:38,375  -->  00:03:39,731
So you saw that?
75

75

00:03:39,731  -->  00:03:41,123
And so that's what we have to do.
76

76

00:03:41,123  -->  00:03:43,633
So again, we have the button outside,
77

77

00:03:43,633  -->  00:03:45,838
and the in there we have two elements,
78

78

00:03:45,838  -->  00:03:47,435
one for each part of the text,
79

79

00:03:47,435  -->  00:03:50,915
which then move down as we hover.
80

80

00:03:50,915  -->  00:03:51,748
Okay.
81

81

00:03:51,748  -->  00:03:53,303
So let's do that.
82

82

00:03:53,303  -->  00:03:56,447
And I'm going to call the first one Button Visible,
83

83

00:03:56,447  -->  00:03:59,351
and the second one Button Hidden.
84

84

00:03:59,351  -->  00:04:02,684
So I'm simply using a span element here.
85

85

00:04:03,827  -->  00:04:06,744
So Button Visible, saying Book Now,
86

86

00:04:08,963  -->  00:04:12,546
and then Button Invisible, and that's where
87

87

00:04:15,899  -->  00:04:17,566
this text here goes.
88

88

00:04:21,143  -->  00:04:23,808
So let's style that, now.
89

89

00:04:23,808  -->  00:04:26,567
Actually, let's first change the font size here,
90

90

00:04:26,567  -->  00:04:29,303
because I saw it was still way too small.
91

91

00:04:29,303  -->  00:04:30,863
Okay.
92

92

00:04:30,863  -->  00:04:31,696
And okay.
93

93

00:04:32,579  -->  00:04:34,079
So now the button.
94

94

00:04:40,403  -->  00:04:42,986
And so now the visible part and
95

95

00:04:43,871  -->  00:04:46,288
of course the invisible part.
96

96

00:04:49,259  -->  00:04:52,342
So let's start with the simple stuff.
97

97

00:04:53,351  -->  00:04:57,518
So the font size of 1.5rem, of course remove the border.
98

98

00:05:01,222  -->  00:05:05,389
Also set the font weight to 300, and also to uppercase.
99

99

00:05:10,894  -->  00:05:14,477
And then give it a nice huge border radius.
100

100

00:05:16,933  -->  00:05:19,738
Okay, so that it's rounded at the sides.
101

101

00:05:19,738  -->  00:05:22,019
Next I also want to change the background,
102

102

00:05:22,019  -->  00:05:24,479
and that should be that gradient that you saw, right?
103

103

00:05:24,479  -->  00:05:26,087
So it was a gradient from our
104

104

00:05:26,087  -->  00:05:29,087
light primary color to the dark one.
105

105

00:05:31,799  -->  00:05:35,966
And so of course then your gradient to the right side,
106

106

00:05:37,079  -->  00:05:41,509
and I don't know why this is always happening.
107

107

00:05:41,509  -->  00:05:44,543
So this is how it should be.
108

108

00:05:44,543  -->  00:05:48,543
So going from the light color to the darker one.
109

109

00:05:59,051  -->  00:05:59,987
All right.
110

110

00:05:59,987  -->  00:06:03,035
And finally, the color of the button, of course,
111

111

00:06:03,035  -->  00:06:05,458
should then be white.
112

112

00:06:05,458  -->  00:06:06,291
All right.
113

113

00:06:06,291  -->  00:06:09,208
So let's take a first look at that.
114

114

00:06:10,619  -->  00:06:11,452
All right.
115

115

00:06:11,452  -->  00:06:15,287
So it's starting to look a bit like our real example.
116

116

00:06:15,287  -->  00:06:19,414
Now, we're ready to start the visible part,
117

117

00:06:19,414  -->  00:06:21,491
so first of all, since it's a span,
118

118

00:06:21,491  -->  00:06:23,534
it's an inline element, but we want it
119

119

00:06:23,534  -->  00:06:27,451
as an inline block, so in order that we can use
120

120

00:06:28,991  -->  00:06:31,500
padding in there, okay?
121

121

00:06:31,500  -->  00:06:35,062
So we want the padding at the top and the right side.
122

122

00:06:35,062  -->  00:06:38,123
So 2rem top and bottom, and then let's put
123

123

00:06:38,123  -->  00:06:41,975
a huge length for left and right, like 7.5rem.
124

124

00:06:41,975  -->  00:06:42,808
Okay?
125

125

00:06:42,808  -->  00:06:45,010
And that's because it's this padding here
126

126

00:06:45,010  -->  00:06:47,566
that is going to define the size of the button.
127

127

00:06:47,566  -->  00:06:51,108
Okay, so let's just take a look at that again.
128

128

00:06:51,108  -->  00:06:51,941
And okay.
129

129

00:06:51,941  -->  00:06:55,139
So now this here is our visible part, remember?
130

130

00:06:55,139  -->  00:06:56,891
So Book Now is the visible,
131

131

00:06:56,891  -->  00:06:59,170
and the hidden part should be that one.
132

132

00:06:59,170  -->  00:07:01,823
So let's now take care of that.
133

133

00:07:01,823  -->  00:07:04,475
And remember that this here should basically be
134

134

00:07:04,475  -->  00:07:07,187
here on top, so that when we hover the button,
135

135

00:07:07,187  -->  00:07:10,633
it can move down here to the center, okay?
136

136

00:07:10,633  -->  00:07:13,186
So we will make this a completely different element
137

137

00:07:13,186  -->  00:07:16,283
that's out of the button in the initial state.
138

138

00:07:16,283  -->  00:07:17,183
Okay.
139

139

00:07:17,183  -->  00:07:18,600
So let's do that.
140

140

00:07:19,571  -->  00:07:22,238
Make it an inline block as well.
141

141

00:07:23,209  -->  00:07:27,292
And then we're going to use absolute positioning.
142

142

00:07:28,127  -->  00:07:28,960
Okay?
143

143

00:07:28,960  -->  00:07:32,735
So that we can really put it outside of our button.
144

144

00:07:32,735  -->  00:07:36,946
Okay, so from the left, it should be zero.
145

145

00:07:36,946  -->  00:07:39,263
And from the top, well, what we have to do
146

146

00:07:39,263  -->  00:07:42,743
is to set it to minus 100%, and what that's going to do
147

147

00:07:42,743  -->  00:07:47,123
is it's going to move up exactly the size of the element.
148

148

00:07:47,123  -->  00:07:49,958
So basically if this element is like 50 pixels high,
149

149

00:07:49,958  -->  00:07:53,435
it will move up 100% of that.
150

150

00:07:53,435  -->  00:07:55,127
And so 50 pixels.
151

151

00:07:55,127  -->  00:07:56,015
Okay?
152

152

00:07:56,015  -->  00:07:59,182
And we also need to give it a padding.
153

153

00:08:00,539  -->  00:08:03,443
And it should be the same padding as this one here.
154

154

00:08:03,443  -->  00:08:07,610
So 2rem and 7.5, and that's actually not really accurate,
155

155

00:08:08,627  -->  00:08:10,763
but I'm going to leave it at this here
156

156

00:08:10,763  -->  00:08:12,574
so I can show you what happens
157

157

00:08:12,574  -->  00:08:14,795
if we do it like this, okay?
158

158

00:08:14,795  -->  00:08:16,608
Now actually what I should also do here
159

159

00:08:16,608  -->  00:08:19,895
is to give it a height and a width of 100%
160

160

00:08:19,895  -->  00:08:21,647
so that it has the height and the width
161

161

00:08:21,647  -->  00:08:23,686
of the parent element once again.
162

162

00:08:23,686  -->  00:08:27,269
So height, 100%, and width, 100%.
163

163

00:08:31,379  -->  00:08:34,894
So let's take a look at that now.
164

164

00:08:34,894  -->  00:08:37,487
And so probably it should be up there somewhere now.
165

165

00:08:37,487  -->  00:08:39,320
So let's inspect that.
166

166

00:08:41,939  -->  00:08:43,859
And actually it's somewhere completely different.
167

167

00:08:43,859  -->  00:08:45,708
And that's because we didn't specify
168

168

00:08:45,708  -->  00:08:47,843
a position on the parent.
169

169

00:08:47,843  -->  00:08:50,327
So I don't know where it really is,
170

170

00:08:50,327  -->  00:08:52,222
but what I know is that it's gone.
171

171

00:08:52,222  -->  00:08:54,767
And so in here we should now set position
172

172

00:08:54,767  -->  00:08:57,358
to relative, of course.
173

173

00:08:57,358  -->  00:08:58,858
Never forget that.
174

174

00:08:59,867  -->  00:09:00,700
Okay.
175

175

00:09:00,700  -->  00:09:03,779
And so right now, this is where the invisible element is,
176

176

00:09:03,779  -->  00:09:06,166
so exactly where we want it to be.
177

177

00:09:06,166  -->  00:09:09,262
Now you see that actually the word Left is here,
178

178

00:09:09,262  -->  00:09:10,750
so it comes out of the button,
179

179

00:09:10,750  -->  00:09:13,549
and that's because it doesn't have enough space, okay?
180

180

00:09:13,549  -->  00:09:17,716
So if we remove this part here, like set it to zero,
181

181

00:09:18,613  -->  00:09:21,708
then it should have enough space to fit all the content.
182

182

00:09:21,708  -->  00:09:25,823
And so that's what I was saying that padding would work,
183

183

00:09:25,823  -->  00:09:27,394
but that I would explain to you later
184

184

00:09:27,394  -->  00:09:29,267
why it wouldn't work.
185

185

00:09:29,267  -->  00:09:33,167
And actually this is not what I have to change, but here.
186

186

00:09:33,167  -->  00:09:34,000
All right.
187

187

00:09:35,099  -->  00:09:36,133
So that's better.
188

188

00:09:36,133  -->  00:09:38,291
And actually you can see it here.
189

189

00:09:38,291  -->  00:09:42,408
Well, not really, but imagine that I changed the color,
190

190

00:09:42,408  -->  00:09:44,741
so let's like put it to red,
191

191

00:09:46,798  -->  00:09:49,309
and then of course you see that the text is here.
192

192

00:09:49,309  -->  00:09:50,183
Okay?
193

193

00:09:50,183  -->  00:09:51,839
And so we should probably hide that part.
194

194

00:09:51,839  -->  00:09:52,672
Right?
195

195

00:09:52,672  -->  00:09:54,158
So how can we do that?
196

196

00:09:54,158  -->  00:09:56,210
Well, actually the best way of doing that
197

197

00:09:56,210  -->  00:09:58,627
is to set overflow to hidden.
198

198

00:10:00,599  -->  00:10:01,534
Okay?
199

199

00:10:01,534  -->  00:10:03,875
Because that element is outside of the button,
200

200

00:10:03,875  -->  00:10:05,891
and so it's an overflow element,
201

201

00:10:05,891  -->  00:10:08,062
and if we set overflow to hidden here,
202

202

00:10:08,062  -->  00:10:11,350
then it will simply disappear.
203

203

00:10:11,350  -->  00:10:12,183
Okay.
204

204

00:10:12,183  -->  00:10:13,957
And so now it is gone.
205

205

00:10:13,957  -->  00:10:16,151
So actually we are ready to already
206

206

00:10:16,151  -->  00:10:18,818
implement the functionality now.
207

207

00:10:20,509  -->  00:10:24,599
So when we hover the button, what do we want to happen?
208

208

00:10:24,599  -->  00:10:26,459
Well, we want something to happen
209

209

00:10:26,459  -->  00:10:28,542
to the visible of course,
210

210

00:10:34,763  -->  00:10:36,513
and to the invisible.
211

211

00:10:38,123  -->  00:10:41,675
So what should happen with the invisible element?
212

212

00:10:41,675  -->  00:10:45,683
Remember that right now it is at top minus 100%.
213

213

00:10:45,683  -->  00:10:47,123
So what is the position where
214

214

00:10:47,123  -->  00:10:49,380
it would be completely visible?
215

215

00:10:49,380  -->  00:10:52,308
Well, it's just top zero, right?
216

216

00:10:52,308  -->  00:10:54,683
And so that's all we have to do.
217

217

00:10:54,683  -->  00:10:55,990
Top zero.
218

218

00:10:55,990  -->  00:10:56,823
Okay?
219

219

00:10:56,823  -->  00:11:01,523
Then of course we want to have a transition here.
220

220

00:11:01,523  -->  00:11:03,538
All in .2 seconds.
221

221

00:11:03,538  -->  00:11:05,955
So let's take a look at that.
222

222

00:11:06,934  -->  00:11:10,438
And well, not a lot is happening, actually.
223

223

00:11:10,438  -->  00:11:14,998
So let's take a look at why that is happening.
224

224

00:11:14,998  -->  00:11:19,271
So let's use here the dev tools and set it to hover.
225

225

00:11:19,271  -->  00:11:23,271
And so what's happening here with the invisible?
226

226

00:11:24,766  -->  00:11:28,079
And actually I don't have any hover state here,
227

227

00:11:28,079  -->  00:11:30,970
so maybe something went wrong.
228

228

00:11:30,970  -->  00:11:33,010
But actually everything should be correct.
229

229

00:11:33,010  -->  00:11:36,260
Let's take a look at the converted CSS,
230

230

00:11:37,308  -->  00:11:41,158
and you'll see that we already have a lot of CSS written,
231

231

00:11:41,158  -->  00:11:42,791
and here is the selector that we just wrote,
232

232

00:11:42,791  -->  00:11:45,695
and actually that's completely incorrect.
233

233

00:11:45,695  -->  00:11:48,370
Okay, so that's not how we can do it.
234

234

00:11:48,370  -->  00:11:50,953
So let's simply put it in here,
235

235

00:11:52,715  -->  00:11:56,137
because that's actually the way it should be done.
236

236

00:11:56,137  -->  00:11:59,099
So that was just a mistake.
237

237

00:11:59,099  -->  00:12:02,766
Okay, and then the same thing for invisible.
238

238

00:12:05,111  -->  00:12:06,944
Let's get rid of that.
239

239

00:12:07,894  -->  00:12:08,894
And of that.
240

240

00:12:12,611  -->  00:12:14,482
And so top zero.
241

241

00:12:14,482  -->  00:12:16,535
And let's try that again.
242

242

00:12:16,535  -->  00:12:18,460
And so now you'll see that it's moving down
243

243

00:12:18,460  -->  00:12:20,508
right into the middle of the button,
244

244

00:12:20,508  -->  00:12:24,258
and as we move out, well, it doesn't go away.
245

245

00:12:25,247  -->  00:12:26,747
Let's reload this.
246

246

00:12:28,439  -->  00:12:29,891
And yeah, so now it's working.
247

247

00:12:29,891  -->  00:12:32,915
As we hover out, it goes away again.
248

248

00:12:32,915  -->  00:12:33,748
Okay.
249

249

00:12:33,748  -->  00:12:34,834
And so now all we have to do
250

250

00:12:34,834  -->  00:12:38,591
is to do something similar with the visible.
251

251

00:12:38,591  -->  00:12:40,835
But in this case, we're not going to use top,
252

252

00:12:40,835  -->  00:12:42,502
because we actually didn't use
253

253

00:12:42,502  -->  00:12:43,933
absolute positioning on it.
254

254

00:12:43,933  -->  00:12:46,114
So instead, we're going to do transform
255

255

00:12:46,114  -->  00:12:48,443
and simply translate it down.
256

256

00:12:48,443  -->  00:12:51,538
So translate Y, so in the Y direction,
257

257

00:12:51,538  -->  00:12:54,299
and 100% of its height.
258

258

00:12:54,299  -->  00:12:56,146
And actually we didn't define its height,
259

259

00:12:56,146  -->  00:13:00,313
so we should probably just do the same as this one here.
260

260

00:13:01,583  -->  00:13:03,310
And then also put a transition.
261

261

00:13:03,310  -->  00:13:06,035
And I'm seeing here that we have a lot of repeated code,
262

262

00:13:06,035  -->  00:13:08,702
so let's simply do it like this.
263

263

00:13:11,303  -->  00:13:15,071
So select all of the child elements,
264

264

00:13:15,071  -->  00:13:18,238
and then all of this here is repeated,
265

265

00:13:20,314  -->  00:13:22,147
such as this one here.
266

266

00:13:23,242  -->  00:13:27,409
So of course you want the transition to happen on both.
267

267

00:13:29,508  -->  00:13:34,270
So a little refactoring in order to make our code better.
268

268

00:13:34,270  -->  00:13:35,103
Okay.
269

269

00:13:35,103  -->  00:13:37,486
So again, what happens here is that this part,
270

270

00:13:37,486  -->  00:13:41,375
the visible part, will translate 100% of its height down.
271

271

00:13:41,375  -->  00:13:42,208
Okay?
272

272

00:13:42,208  -->  00:13:45,095
And so with this, it should already be working pretty well.
273

273

00:13:45,095  -->  00:13:46,428
And yeah, it is.
274

274

00:13:47,338  -->  00:13:49,151
So that is the functionality that
275

275

00:13:49,151  -->  00:13:51,143
we were looking for, right?
276

276

00:13:51,143  -->  00:13:53,256
Now the only difference to the original
277

277

00:13:53,256  -->  00:13:54,970
is that we also changed the gradient
278

278

00:13:54,970  -->  00:13:56,651
from one side to the other.
279

279

00:13:56,651  -->  00:13:58,734
So let's do that as well.
280

280

00:14:00,972  -->  00:14:03,139
So let's just put it here.
281

281

00:14:11,699  -->  00:14:14,014
So it went to the right, and now we can
282

282

00:14:14,014  -->  00:14:16,619
simply change it to the left.
283

283

00:14:16,619  -->  00:14:17,452
All right.
284

284

00:14:17,452  -->  00:14:20,202
And the final thing is the focus.
285

285

00:14:23,747  -->  00:14:26,650
So remember to focus on the inline button.
286

286

00:14:26,650  -->  00:14:28,151
Well, here in this button, we're going to do
287

287

00:14:28,151  -->  00:14:29,901
the exact same thing.
288

288

00:14:31,199  -->  00:14:34,958
So outline, none, but instead of having that outline,
289

289

00:14:34,958  -->  00:14:38,303
we have the animation that we already coded,
290

290

00:14:38,303  -->  00:14:40,342
and it's called pulsate.
291

291

00:14:40,342  -->  00:14:42,527
We want it to run for one second,
292

292

00:14:42,527  -->  00:14:45,251
and basically forever, so infinite.
293

293

00:14:45,251  -->  00:14:48,782
And with that, we should be ready.
294

294

00:14:48,782  -->  00:14:52,379
So you saw that the gradient changed,
295

295

00:14:52,379  -->  00:14:54,934
and it's not transitioning, actually,
296

296

00:14:54,934  -->  00:14:56,879
and that's because transition doesn't work
297

297

00:14:56,879  -->  00:14:58,681
for background images, and so it also
298

298

00:14:58,681  -->  00:15:00,286
doesn't work for gradients.
299

299

00:15:00,286  -->  00:15:01,979
But that doesn't really matter because
300

300

00:15:01,979  -->  00:15:04,127
with the other animation that we have going on here,
301

301

00:15:04,127  -->  00:15:05,819
you don't even really notice that.
302

302

00:15:05,819  -->  00:15:07,055
Okay?
303

303

00:15:07,055  -->  00:15:07,888
Okay.
304

304

00:15:07,888  -->  00:15:10,162
And the other thing is to now click it,
305

305

00:15:10,162  -->  00:15:12,779
and then you see the pulsating animation,
306

306

00:15:12,779  -->  00:15:14,891
and so it looks like it's really calling you,
307

307

00:15:14,891  -->  00:15:16,595
"Please click me," okay?
308

308

00:15:16,595  -->  00:15:20,423
So that's the purpose of this animation.
309

309

00:15:20,423  -->  00:15:24,334
And this here of course keeps working,
310

310

00:15:24,334  -->  00:15:27,671
and let's just add a cursor here.
311

311

00:15:27,671  -->  00:15:29,603
So that's also missing.
312

312

00:15:29,603  -->  00:15:31,520
So cursor, and pointer.
313

313

00:15:33,683  -->  00:15:35,195
Okay.
314

314

00:15:35,195  -->  00:15:38,445
And so with that, we are actually done.
315

315

00:15:40,008  -->  00:15:43,379
So let's compare it, and it looks the same,
316

316

00:15:43,379  -->  00:15:45,203
except that the text here is a bit smaller,
317

317

00:15:45,203  -->  00:15:48,286
but that doesn't really matter, okay?
318

318

00:15:49,334  -->  00:15:50,458
So great.
319

319

00:15:50,458  -->  00:15:51,791
We are ready with this project,
320

320

00:15:51,791  -->  00:15:53,964
at least for the non-responsive part.
321

321

00:15:53,964  -->  00:15:57,464
So right now if we tried to decrease this,
322

322

00:15:58,346  -->  00:16:00,929
so let's go here to the mobile.
323

323

00:16:01,859  -->  00:16:04,739
Then it's not going to do a really good job
324

324

00:16:04,739  -->  00:16:07,799
to adapt to mobile screens, for example.
325

325

00:16:07,799  -->  00:16:09,539
Okay, so as we get smaller,
326

326

00:16:09,539  -->  00:16:11,292
it starts looking like this.
327

327

00:16:11,292  -->  00:16:12,971
And so that's what we have to fix
328

328

00:16:12,971  -->  00:16:14,616
over the next couple of lectures.
329

329

00:16:14,616  -->  00:16:15,449
Okay?
330

330

00:16:15,449  -->  00:16:17,640
But for now, this is still great.
331

331

00:16:17,640  -->  00:16:20,291
So congratulations for finishing this project
332

332

00:16:20,291  -->  00:16:22,955
and for learning everything you learned
333

333

00:16:22,955  -->  00:16:24,899
about Flex Box in this section.
334

334

00:16:24,899  -->  00:16:26,796
And actually not only Flex Box,
335

335

00:16:26,796  -->  00:16:29,507
because I also showed you a couple of other cool tricks
336

336

00:16:29,507  -->  00:16:31,163
and techniques here in this section,
337

337

00:16:31,163  -->  00:16:34,427
but of course the main focus was on Flex Box.
338

338

00:16:34,427  -->  00:16:37,415
And so I hope you really mastered that by now.
339

339

00:16:37,415  -->  00:16:39,288
So project is finished.
340

340

00:16:39,288  -->  00:16:40,727
Over the next couple of lectures,
341

341

00:16:40,727  -->  00:16:42,491
as I was saying, we will take care of
342

342

00:16:42,491  -->  00:16:44,363
writing some media queries in order to
343

343

00:16:44,363  -->  00:16:46,379
make everything super responsive here,
344

344

00:16:46,379  -->  00:16:49,212
and adapted to mobile and tablets.
