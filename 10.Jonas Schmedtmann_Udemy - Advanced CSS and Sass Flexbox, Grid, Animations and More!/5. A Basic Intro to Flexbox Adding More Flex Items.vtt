2

00:00:02.183  -->  00:00:04.645
this basic intro to Flexbox part,
3

3

00:00:04.645  -->  00:00:06.421
I wanna quickly show you what happens
4

4

00:00:06.421  -->  00:00:10.588
when we have a whole lot of flex items in a flex container.
5

5

00:00:11.657  -->  00:00:14.213
So right now, we have these five elements,
6

6

00:00:14.213  -->  00:00:18.534
but what happens if we just add another five of these?
7

7

00:00:18.534  -->  00:00:19.795
Okay.
8

8

00:00:19.795  -->  00:00:23.962
So let's get rid of these class names here, of course.
9

9

00:00:25.407  -->  00:00:28.405
And then six, seven, eight,
10

10

00:00:28.405  -->  00:00:29.865
nine...
11

11

00:00:29.865  -->  00:00:30.698
And ten.
12

12

00:00:31.787  -->  00:00:34.413
Okay, so you see that all of these flex items,
13

13

00:00:34.413  -->  00:00:36.950
they are now getting cramped here into this line.
14

14

00:00:36.950  -->  00:00:38.894
And if we decrease this even more,
15

15

00:00:38.894  -->  00:00:41.369
then there's even less and less space available,
16

16

00:00:41.369  -->  00:00:44.105
and at some point they even start overflowing
17

17

00:00:44.105  -->  00:00:47.890
the flex container like this like we saw before, actually.
18

18

00:00:47.890  -->  00:00:49.733
But as you know, there's another property
19

19

00:00:49.733  -->  00:00:52.925
that we can use on the flex container, right?
20

20

00:00:52.925  -->  00:00:55.866
And it is called flex-wrap.
21

21

00:00:55.866  -->  00:00:56.949
So flex-wrap,
22

22

00:00:58.237  -->  00:01:00.342
and its initial value is no-wrap
23

23

00:01:00.342  -->  00:01:03.212
and that's because it's not wrapping into a new line,
24

24

00:01:03.212  -->  00:01:06.414
but if we say wrap like this,
25

25

00:01:06.414  -->  00:01:09.003
then it will create a new line for these flex items
26

26

00:01:09.003  -->  00:01:11.669
that no longer fit the container,
27

27

00:01:11.669  -->  00:01:13.805
and so that's actually happening already.
28

28

00:01:13.805  -->  00:01:16.694
So you see that this item here with the three,
29

29

00:01:16.694  -->  00:01:20.263
so this i3 here which has this flex set to one
30

30

00:01:20.263  -->  00:01:22.822
has now an entire new row for itself.
31

31

00:01:22.822  -->  00:01:25.462
And if we actually decrease this even more,
32

32

00:01:25.462  -->  00:01:27.395
then you'll see that more and more elements
33

33

00:01:27.395  -->  00:01:29.503
come down here to the second row.
34

34

00:01:29.503  -->  00:01:32.287
So basically, the second line that is created here
35

35

00:01:32.287  -->  00:01:35.534
has the flex items start to wrap, okay.
36

36

00:01:35.534  -->  00:01:37.721
And once more, this can be pretty useful
37

37

00:01:37.721  -->  00:01:40.714
for responsive design when we get less and less space
38

38

00:01:40.714  -->  00:01:43.399
to work with in our layouts, right?
39

39

00:01:43.399  -->  00:01:45.604
Now let's again get rid
40

40

00:01:45.604  -->  00:01:48.853
of these huge margins that we have here.
41

41

00:01:48.853  -->  00:01:50.717
So I'm gonna put five pixels here just so that
42

42

00:01:50.717  -->  00:01:52.696
we have a little bit of margin,
43

43

00:01:52.696  -->  00:01:54.365
and so that's what it looks like.
44

44

00:01:54.365  -->  00:01:57.349
Now, let me actually increase the container here, okay.
45

45

00:01:57.349  -->  00:01:58.404
So you see it right now,
46

46

00:01:58.404  -->  00:02:00.354
the container ends here, of course.
47

47

00:02:00.354  -->  00:02:01.554
And that makes sense,
48

48

00:02:01.554  -->  00:02:03.489
but for what I wanna show you next,
49

49

00:02:03.489  -->  00:02:05.526
we need a higher container.
50

50

00:02:05.526  -->  00:02:07.268
So let's increase it.
51

51

00:02:07.268  -->  00:02:09.851
While not that much probably...
52

52

00:02:11.190  -->  00:02:13.082
So let's actually...
53

53

00:02:13.082  -->  00:02:16.565
Like, I dunno, maybe 1000 pixels
54

54

00:02:16.565  -->  00:02:20.274
and so let's see what it looks like, like this.
55

55

00:02:20.274  -->  00:02:21.617
So with all the space,
56

56

00:02:21.617  -->  00:02:23.960
this creates a bunch of different lines here.
57

57

00:02:23.960  -->  00:02:26.276
Actually, I'm not sure about this one here.
58

58

00:02:26.276  -->  00:02:27.609
Let's reload it.
59

59

00:02:28.947  -->  00:02:32.947
Or first, save this actually and then reload it.
60

60

00:02:35.137  -->  00:02:36.468
Alright it still does that.
61

61

00:02:36.468  -->  00:02:38.271
Okay, that looks a bit weird here.
62

62

00:02:38.271  -->  00:02:40.030
It looks like it should be in here.
63

63

00:02:40.030  -->  00:02:42.151
Let's check that one out.
64

64

00:02:42.151  -->  00:02:43.371
And you know, of course, it is just
65

65

00:02:43.371  -->  00:02:46.713
because it sat here to flex-end here, okay.
66

66

00:02:46.713  -->  00:02:49.200
So that's the only reason why it's down here.
67

67

00:02:49.200  -->  00:02:51.222
It's actually on the same row as this one.
68

68

00:02:51.222  -->  00:02:54.588
Let's just change this one here,
69

69

00:02:54.588  -->  00:02:56.726
or simply get rid of it.
70

70

00:02:56.726  -->  00:02:58.213
So that's the same effect.
71

71

00:02:58.213  -->  00:03:01.466
So, what happens here is that we have two rows.
72

72

00:03:01.466  -->  00:03:03.391
Basically, so first this one
73

73

00:03:03.391  -->  00:03:05.035
and then this one.
74

74

00:03:05.035  -->  00:03:07.701
Now why is all of this space here between these rows?
75

75

00:03:07.701  -->  00:03:09.660
So this and this one.
76

76

00:03:09.660  -->  00:03:12.316
Well, that's because of the align-content property
77

77

00:03:12.316  -->  00:03:13.769
that I didn't show you yet.
78

78

00:03:13.769  -->  00:03:16.132
And so, I'm gonna show it to you right now.
79

79

00:03:16.132  -->  00:03:18.710
And that's one of these, that's once again,
80

80

00:03:18.710  -->  00:03:21.293
set here on the flex container.
81

81

00:03:23.409  -->  00:03:27.409
So align-content and let's set it to flex-start.
82

82

00:03:29.596  -->  00:03:32.859
Okay and so now all of these rows move up.
83

83

00:03:32.859  -->  00:03:34.506
Okay and that is because
84

84

00:03:34.506  -->  00:03:36.972
what the align-content property does is that
85

85

00:03:36.972  -->  00:03:39.794
it aligns the rows along the cross axis.
86

86

00:03:39.794  -->  00:03:41.929
So it's pretty similar to align-items
87

87

00:03:41.929  -->  00:03:43.764
with the difference that align-items
88

88

00:03:43.764  -->  00:03:47.125
aligns the flex items as the name actually says,
89

89

00:03:47.125  -->  00:03:51.049
and align-content aligns entire, let's say rows,
90

90

00:03:51.049  -->  00:03:53.113
along the cross-axis, right?
91

91

00:03:53.113  -->  00:03:55.741
And so now, as we set flex-start here,
92

92

00:03:55.741  -->  00:03:58.741
both these rows are now here at the beginning,
93

93

00:03:58.741  -->  00:04:02.538
and then all of the space down here is empty, right?
94

94

00:04:02.538  -->  00:04:04.832
Now we can also set it to flex-end
95

95

00:04:04.832  -->  00:04:06.106
just to demonstrate you that,
96

96

00:04:06.106  -->  00:04:09.130
and so both rows basically moved down here.
97

97

00:04:09.130  -->  00:04:10.041
Okay.
98

98

00:04:10.041  -->  00:04:12.804
Let me decrease this a bit here so that
99

99

00:04:12.804  -->  00:04:15.130
the last row doesn't have only this one element.
100

100

00:04:15.130  -->  00:04:16.088
Okay.
101

101

00:04:16.088  -->  00:04:20.362
And so let's, actually try another one here.
102

102

00:04:20.362  -->  00:04:22.588
So, center, which is also pretty useful.
103

103

00:04:22.588  -->  00:04:26.397
And so now, as you can guess, the space here, up here
104

104

00:04:26.397  -->  00:04:27.742
is the same as the one down here
105

105

00:04:27.742  -->  00:04:30.458
because these two rows are now centered
106

106

00:04:30.458  -->  00:04:33.216
inside the flex container along the cross axis.
107

107

00:04:33.216  -->  00:04:35.679
So basically, vertically, right?
108

108

00:04:35.679  -->  00:04:38.090
Now this is a bit difficult to visualize here
109

109

00:04:38.090  -->  00:04:40.744
because we don't have a lot of space here, okay.
110

110

00:04:40.744  -->  00:04:43.868
We just increase this a little bit more.
111

111

00:04:43.868  -->  00:04:45.171
Okay.
112

112

00:04:45.171  -->  00:04:46.662
Now there's also space around
113

113

00:04:46.662  -->  00:04:49.600
just as we have in justify-content.
114

114

00:04:49.600  -->  00:04:52.046
So it's the same logic.
115

115

00:04:52.046  -->  00:04:53.591
And this is what it looks like.
116

116

00:04:53.591  -->  00:04:56.748
So basically, it distributes the space between the rows so
117

117

00:04:56.748  -->  00:04:58.452
that the space on the bottom
118

118

00:04:58.452  -->  00:05:01.558
and on top of each of the rows is the same.
119

119

00:05:01.558  -->  00:05:05.055
Okay, so just like with justify-content.
120

120

00:05:05.055  -->  00:05:07.638
Then we also have space between
121

121

00:05:08.858  -->  00:05:10.492
which will push one of the lines
122

122

00:05:10.492  -->  00:05:11.863
to the top of the element
123

123

00:05:11.863  -->  00:05:15.277
and the other one to the bottom, okay.
124

124

00:05:15.277  -->  00:05:19.271
And then finally, stretch which is actually the default.
125

125

00:05:19.271  -->  00:05:21.021
So the initial value.
126

126

00:05:22.894  -->  00:05:24.478
Now the stretch here doesn't really
127

127

00:05:24.478  -->  00:05:26.756
stretch all of these elements
128

128

00:05:26.756  -->  00:05:28.832
like it does in align-items, okay.
129

129

00:05:28.832  -->  00:05:30.762
It just stretches the rows
130

130

00:05:30.762  -->  00:05:32.350
which is not really visible.
131

131

00:05:32.350  -->  00:05:36.448
So this is pretty similar to like space-between, okay.
132

132

00:05:36.448  -->  00:05:39.267
So, align-content is the last property
133

133

00:05:39.267  -->  00:05:40.815
that I wanted to show you.
134

134

00:05:40.815  -->  00:05:44.028
And again, it controls how the rows are aligned
135

135

00:05:44.028  -->  00:05:47.210
along the cross axis similar to align-items
136

136

00:05:47.210  -->  00:05:49.060
and that is actually it.
137

137

00:05:49.060  -->  00:05:50.752
So that's all I had to show you
138

138

00:05:50.752  -->  00:05:54.844
here in this very basic introduction about Flexbox.
139

139

00:05:54.844  -->  00:05:57.496
So now you know the very, very fundamentals of Flexbox
140

140

00:05:57.496  -->  00:06:00.035
so that you are ready to move on to the project
141

141

00:06:00.035  -->  00:06:02.486
that we are about to start in the next lecture.
142

142

00:06:02.486  -->  00:06:04.538
So, are you excited about that?
143

143

00:06:04.538  -->  00:06:08.215
Then don't wait and join me right in the next lecture.
144

144

00:06:08.215  -->  00:06:09.298
See ya there.
