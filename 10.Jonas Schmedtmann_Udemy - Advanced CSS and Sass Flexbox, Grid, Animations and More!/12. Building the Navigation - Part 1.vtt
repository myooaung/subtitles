00:00:01.064  -->  00:00:02.517
<v Lecturer>Hey, there.</v>
2

2

00:00:02.517  -->  00:00:05.654
Let's now build the side bar and the navigation of our app
3

3

00:00:05.654  -->  00:00:08.675
and so, we will once more, build a really cool,
4

4

00:00:08.675  -->  00:00:12.220
hover effect, that I already showed you before
5

5

00:00:12.220  -->  00:00:14.746
and for that, I'm gonna show you how to use transform
6

6

00:00:14.746  -->  00:00:17.850
with scaleY and how to transition, multiple properties
7

7

00:00:17.850  -->  00:00:21.331
with different settings, plus, you're gonna learn
8

8

00:00:21.331  -->  00:00:24.225
how and why to use the current color variable
9

9

00:00:24.225  -->  00:00:25.607
and how to use even more
10

10

00:00:25.607  -->  00:00:28.215
advanced flexbox alignment techniques,
11

11

00:00:28.215  -->  00:00:30.412
so, let's get to work.
12

12

00:00:30.412  -->  00:00:32.338
So, the side bar, that I'm talking about
13

13

00:00:32.338  -->  00:00:34.486
is of course, this one here,
14

14

00:00:34.486  -->  00:00:36.341
so, up here, we have our navigation
15

15

00:00:36.341  -->  00:00:38.935
with this nice hover effect that I was talking about
16

16

00:00:38.935  -->  00:00:40.791
and then down here, we just have
17

17

00:00:40.791  -->  00:00:42.941
some copyright text, okay?
18

18

00:00:42.941  -->  00:00:45.782
So, that is what we're gonna do in this lecture
19

19

00:00:45.782  -->  00:00:49.137
and as always, let's start with the HTML Markup,
20

20

00:00:49.137  -->  00:00:51.019
so, we have our nav here,
21

21

00:00:51.019  -->  00:00:53.209
let's give it some space here
22

22

00:00:53.209  -->  00:00:55.525
and then, let's start.
23

23

00:00:55.525  -->  00:01:00.301
So, the navigation as usual, is an unordered list
24

24

00:01:00.301  -->  00:01:02.743
and I'm calling it side nav,
25

25

00:01:02.743  -->  00:01:05.084
so, for the side navigation of course,
26

26

00:01:05.084  -->  00:01:07.002
then, in here, each of the navigation elements
27

27

00:01:07.002  -->  00:01:09.169
is of course, in list item
28

28

00:01:10.103  -->  00:01:12.522
and it has the name, side nav, which is the blog
29

29

00:01:12.522  -->  00:01:16.022
and then, the element name is simply, item
30

30

00:01:17.573  -->  00:01:21.656
and then, in here, of course, the anchor element,
31

31

00:01:23.241  -->  00:01:27.324
so, side nav link with the href, going to nowhere
32

32

00:01:29.056  -->  00:01:32.489
and then, in here, we finally have our icon and our text,
33

33

00:01:32.489  -->  00:01:35.748
so, we do this exactly the same way we did it before,
34

34

00:01:35.748  -->  00:01:38.748
so, svg with the class side nav icon
35

35

00:01:42.966  -->  00:01:47.005
and then in here, we use the use element,
36

36

00:01:47.005  -->  00:01:50.922
so, xlink href and then, we want our sprite svg
37

37

00:01:53.454  -->  00:01:56.670
and now, let's take a look at which icon we actually want,
38

38

00:01:56.670  -->  00:01:59.220
so, the first one, is this house
39

39

00:01:59.220  -->  00:02:01.919
then, we have the flight then, the key and then,
40

40

00:02:01.919  -->  00:02:03.294
here, this map,
41

41

00:02:03.294  -->  00:02:06.110
so, first up is the one called icon home
42

42

00:02:06.110  -->  00:02:08.389
and so, remember all we have to do is to now
43

43

00:02:08.389  -->  00:02:11.472
set the hash icon here and that's it.
44

44

00:02:11.472  -->  00:02:13.472
Close it and here we go,
45

45

00:02:14.331  -->  00:02:17.915
so, again, this is the best way of using svg's in HTML's
46

46

00:02:17.915  -->  00:02:20.283
by only including one svg file,
47

47

00:02:20.283  -->  00:02:21.330
which is this sprite, here,
48

48

00:02:21.330  -->  00:02:25.547
so, we include this, here and here and up here,
49

49

00:02:25.547  -->  00:02:26.948
but this is all the same file,
50

50

00:02:26.948  -->  00:02:28.968
so we only have one HTTP request,
51

51

00:02:28.968  -->  00:02:32.630
so, that's the whole goal of having a sprite image.
52

52

00:02:32.630  -->  00:02:36.069
Okay, so, this one is the icon home
53

53

00:02:36.069  -->  00:02:39.757
and so, let's just add a span element here very quickly,
54

54

00:02:39.757  -->  00:02:42.901
just to put the text here, okay?
55

55

00:02:42.901  -->  00:02:44.593
So, this one is for a hotel
56

56

00:02:44.593  -->  00:02:48.225
and so, this is how, one list item here, looks like
57

57

00:02:48.225  -->  00:02:52.698
in the navigation, so let's grab a copy of this
58

58

00:02:52.698  -->  00:02:55.448
and make four of them, all right,
59

59

00:02:57.149  -->  00:02:59.982
so, the next one is for the flight
60

60

00:03:02.069  -->  00:03:04.236
then, car rental and tours
61

61

00:03:06.617  -->  00:03:08.754
and so, let's now get the icons,
62

62

00:03:08.754  -->  00:03:12.921
so, icon aircraft takeoff, well, that's a long one,
63

63

00:03:15.093  -->  00:03:19.260
then the car rental was the key, so it's just, key
64

64

00:03:21.014  -->  00:03:24.696
and the last one, is probably just called map,
65

65

00:03:24.696  -->  00:03:26.613
so, here we go and map,
66

66

00:03:28.815  -->  00:03:32.043
so, that is the markup for the navigation
67

67

00:03:32.043  -->  00:03:36.566
and now let's just put the legal text right under this one,
68

68

00:03:36.566  -->  00:03:40.487
so, it's just a div and I'm calling it legal
69

69

00:03:40.487  -->  00:03:41.784
and then, just some text here,
70

70

00:03:41.784  -->  00:03:44.476
so, copy and this is an HTML entity,
71

71

00:03:44.476  -->  00:03:47.976
which I showed you before, 2017 by trillo,
72

72

00:03:51.791  -->  00:03:53.879
all rights reserved.
73

73

00:03:53.879  -->  00:03:56.030
But once again, I want to mention here,
74

74

00:03:56.030  -->  00:03:58.967
that you can feel completely free to use this project,
75

75

00:03:58.967  -->  00:04:02.371
like in your portfolio or to show off for potential
76

76

00:04:02.371  -->  00:04:03.833
clients, or something like that,
77

77

00:04:03.833  -->  00:04:05.524
what you can't do though, is to claim that
78

78

00:04:05.524  -->  00:04:07.465
you designed it by yourself, okay?
79

79

00:04:07.465  -->  00:04:09.850
But it's fine if you use it for your own projects
80

80

00:04:09.850  -->  00:04:12.671
or you can change some stuff and then do your own app
81

81

00:04:12.671  -->  00:04:14.402
maybe, using this interface,
82

82

00:04:14.402  -->  00:04:16.859
so, all of that is no problem, okay?
83

83

00:04:16.859  -->  00:04:21.026
But, with that being said, let's now check out our webpage
84

84

00:04:22.360  -->  00:04:24.631
and whoa, so, here we go,
85

85

00:04:24.631  -->  00:04:26.817
these icons are really huge, as you can see
86

86

00:04:26.817  -->  00:04:29.663
and what you can also see, is that, now here,
87

87

00:04:29.663  -->  00:04:30.960
the other side of the content,
88

88

00:04:30.960  -->  00:04:33.717
so, the hotel view stretched all the way here,
89

89

00:04:33.717  -->  00:04:35.693
on to the bottom of this container,
90

90

00:04:35.693  -->  00:04:38.135
and remember, that's because we're using flexbox, here,
91

91

00:04:38.135  -->  00:04:42.074
to put this one, here, on side of the hotel view
92

92

00:04:42.074  -->  00:04:44.657
and since the default of aligned items,
93

93

00:04:44.657  -->  00:04:47.317
this stretched, well, the will both stretch,
94

94

00:04:47.317  -->  00:04:48.992
all the way they can and so, automatically,
95

95

00:04:48.992  -->  00:04:51.381
when you increase the height of one of the columns, here,
96

96

00:04:51.381  -->  00:04:54.575
the height of the other column increases as well
97

97

00:04:54.575  -->  00:04:56.330
and so, that's great, without
98

98

00:04:56.330  -->  00:04:57.881
having to write any extra quote,
99

99

00:04:57.881  -->  00:05:00.080
this functionality here, works just fine
100

100

00:05:00.080  -->  00:05:04.295
and usually, that's exactly what we want.
101

101

00:05:04.295  -->  00:05:06.593
So, moving on to our CSS, now,
102

102

00:05:06.593  -->  00:05:10.644
let's write all the selectors, such as we've been doing,
103

103

00:05:10.644  -->  00:05:13.101
so, first we write the selectors and then we start
104

104

00:05:13.101  -->  00:05:14.529
filling it with some quote,
105

105

00:05:14.529  -->  00:05:16.112
so, side navigation
106

106

00:05:23.502  -->  00:05:25.585
so, what do we have here,
107

107

00:05:28.097  -->  00:05:29.847
we have the nav item,
108

108

00:05:32.160  -->  00:05:32.993
the link,
109

109

00:05:34.896  -->  00:05:37.126
let me see what else,
110

110

00:05:37.126  -->  00:05:39.126
so, item, link and icon,
111

111

00:05:45.486  -->  00:05:47.731
okay, and then, down here,
112

112

00:05:47.731  -->  00:05:50.073
we have the legal text
113

113

00:05:50.073  -->  00:05:52.283
and since, it's a completely new block
114

114

00:05:52.283  -->  00:05:55.950
or a new component, let's add a new comment,
115

115

00:06:00.324  -->  00:06:01.406
just like this
116

116

00:06:01.406  -->  00:06:05.215
and since we're here, let's actually already style this text
117

117

00:06:05.215  -->  00:06:07.132
so, font size, 1.2 rem.
118

118

00:06:10.604  -->  00:06:14.810
The text should be aligned to the center.
119

119

00:06:14.810  -->  00:06:17.380
I want some padding of 2.5 rem, here
120

120

00:06:17.380  -->  00:06:20.337
and finally, I also want some color,
121

121

00:06:20.337  -->  00:06:22.575
so, let's add it here, close to the text properties
122

122

00:06:22.575  -->  00:06:25.473
and the color that I want
123

123

00:06:25.473  -->  00:06:27.473
is some nice, light gray
124

124

00:06:28.441  -->  00:06:30.249
and it's this one here, so the darkest of them,
125

125

00:06:30.249  -->  00:06:32.765
so that it makes a nice contrast
126

126

00:06:32.765  -->  00:06:35.432
with the really dark background.
127

127

00:06:37.218  -->  00:06:40.295
So, that is the legal text, let's now just
128

128

00:06:40.295  -->  00:06:42.634
very quickly decrease the size of these huge icons
129

129

00:06:42.634  -->  00:06:45.111
in the navigation, so that
130

130

00:06:45.111  -->  00:06:47.244
it doesn't look that crazy anymore
131

131

00:06:47.244  -->  00:06:50.494
so, we say width, and let's use 175 rem
132

132

00:06:54.188  -->  00:06:57.438
and of course, the same for the height,
133

133

00:06:58.476  -->  00:07:01.951
so, usually, we size these icons here, in svg
134

134

00:07:01.951  -->  00:07:03.368
as squares, okay?
135

135

00:07:05.049  -->  00:07:07.192
So, let's take a look now, and yeah.
136

136

00:07:07.192  -->  00:07:08.609
So, that looks much better,
137

137

00:07:08.609  -->  00:07:11.373
of course, there's a lot of formatting to do here, still
138

138

00:07:11.373  -->  00:07:12.791
but we can do that in a bit,
139

139

00:07:12.791  -->  00:07:14.728
well actually, there's an icon here, missing.
140

140

00:07:14.728  -->  00:07:17.014
Let's check that one out,
141

141

00:07:17.014  -->  00:07:18.014
so, ah okay.
142

142

00:07:21.128  -->  00:07:23.251
The icon here, is twice
143

143

00:07:23.251  -->  00:07:24.802
so, now it should be here.
144

144

00:07:24.802  -->  00:07:25.741
Yeah, there we are.
145

145

00:07:25.741  -->  00:07:27.177
Okay, so now, before we actually format,
146

146

00:07:27.177  -->  00:07:30.198
this navigation part here, let's actually finish
147

147

00:07:30.198  -->  00:07:32.846
the formatting of this entire side bar here,
148

148

00:07:32.846  -->  00:07:36.397
because there's still, something left to do
149

149

00:07:36.397  -->  00:07:38.701
and for that, let's first increase the height,
150

150

00:07:38.701  -->  00:07:39.948
here, of this hotel view,
151

151

00:07:39.948  -->  00:07:42.497
to pretend that, there's already a lot of content here,
152

152

00:07:42.497  -->  00:07:46.776
so, that it's approximately, this height here
153

153

00:07:46.776  -->  00:07:51.537
and later, we of course, will then remove that height,
154

154

00:07:51.537  -->  00:07:55.704
so, component and actually, it's in the layout here,
155

155

00:07:57.361  -->  00:07:59.528
so, it's in the hotel view
156

156

00:08:00.464  -->  00:08:04.123
and we can say height, let's say like,
157

157

00:08:04.123  -->  00:08:05.776
something really huge, like 80 rem,
158

158

00:08:05.776  -->  00:08:08.218
so, these two here, are just for testing purposes,
159

159

00:08:08.218  -->  00:08:10.801
we're gonna remove them, later.
160

160

00:08:11.642  -->  00:08:13.309
Test, and all right,
161

161

00:08:15.030  -->  00:08:17.212
so now, it's huge, just so that
162

162

00:08:17.212  -->  00:08:19.842
as it looks, as if there was already a lot of content.
163

163

00:08:19.842  -->  00:08:21.310
Now, if you noticed here on the original,
164

164

00:08:21.310  -->  00:08:24.600
this text, this legal text is pushed all the way, here,
165

165

00:08:24.600  -->  00:08:26.832
to the bottom, okay
166

166

00:08:26.832  -->  00:08:29.054
and I did that, because it's a great opportunity
167

167

00:08:29.054  -->  00:08:32.849
to show you, yet another technique in flexbox, okay?
168

168

00:08:32.849  -->  00:08:35.742
So, let me show you that.
169

169

00:08:35.742  -->  00:08:37.598
So, let's think together, here.
170

170

00:08:37.598  -->  00:08:39.330
Imagine that, this overall sidebar here,
171

171

00:08:39.330  -->  00:08:42.493
would be a flex container and that this legal text
172

172

00:08:42.493  -->  00:08:45.244
and this navigation here, were the flex items.
173

173

00:08:45.244  -->  00:08:48.013
How would you then, create a lot of space, here
174

174

00:08:48.013  -->  00:08:50.798
in between these two, so that the legal text
175

175

00:08:50.798  -->  00:08:53.448
is pushed all the way to the bottom?
176

176

00:08:53.448  -->  00:08:56.172
What do you think is the best way of achieving this?
177

177

00:08:56.172  -->  00:09:00.304
Well, the justify content property set to space between,
178

178

00:09:00.304  -->  00:09:02.425
sounds actually, perfect for that, right?
179

179

00:09:02.425  -->  00:09:04.607
Now, this works along the main axis
180

180

00:09:04.607  -->  00:09:06.760
and so, the main axis is usually,
181

181

00:09:06.760  -->  00:09:09.459
from the left to the right, so like this.
182

182

00:09:09.459  -->  00:09:12.033
Not from top to bottom but there is actually,
183

183

00:09:12.033  -->  00:09:15.615
a solution for that, and that is to use flex direction
184

184

00:09:15.615  -->  00:09:19.040
and so, right now, we're finally gonna use flex direction
185

185

00:09:19.040  -->  00:09:22.462
with a really good use case for it, okay?
186

186

00:09:22.462  -->  00:09:25.238
So, let's do that and so, all we have to do
187

187

00:09:25.238  -->  00:09:28.256
is to come here, to the sidebar
188

188

00:09:28.256  -->  00:09:32.468
set it to display flex, to say that it's a flex container
189

189

00:09:32.468  -->  00:09:36.551
and then, say flex direction and set it to column
190

190

00:09:37.759  -->  00:09:40.506
and now, we just change the direction of the main axis
191

191

00:09:40.506  -->  00:09:43.947
from left to right, to top to bottom, okay?
192

192

00:09:43.947  -->  00:09:46.083
Now without declaring anything else, here,
193

193

00:09:46.083  -->  00:09:48.099
this will not change much, as you can see here.
194

194

00:09:48.099  -->  00:09:49.461
Right, so it still looks the same,
195

195

00:09:49.461  -->  00:09:53.628
but now, we are ready to use the justify content property
196

196

00:09:54.651  -->  00:09:58.818
so, justify content, and we want it set to space between
197

197

00:10:01.930  -->  00:10:04.807
and the result, is of course, that.
198

198

00:10:04.807  -->  00:10:06.880
So, now, this legal text, is pushed
199

199

00:10:06.880  -->  00:10:10.249
all the way to the bottom, while this here, stays at the top
200

200

00:10:10.249  -->  00:10:12.747
and that's because, flexbox divides all the available
201

201

00:10:12.747  -->  00:10:14.744
wide space between the elements
202

202

00:10:14.744  -->  00:10:16.579
and in this case, there are only two elements
203

203

00:10:16.579  -->  00:10:18.807
and so, therefore, one is pushed to one side,
204

204

00:10:18.807  -->  00:10:21.642
and the other one is pushed to the other side.
205

205

00:10:21.642  -->  00:10:24.544
Of course, we could also change it to other things,
206

206

00:10:24.544  -->  00:10:27.422
so, let's do that here, in the def tools,
207

207

00:10:27.422  -->  00:10:31.655
so, we could have space around, as always
208

208

00:10:31.655  -->  00:10:33.884
and then it would look like this,
209

209

00:10:33.884  -->  00:10:37.146
so, it would have half the space here on one side,
210

210

00:10:37.146  -->  00:10:39.239
the other half here, on the other side
211

211

00:10:39.239  -->  00:10:41.412
and then the same thing for the navigation,
212

212

00:10:41.412  -->  00:10:43.088
but that's not what we want here, right?
213

213

00:10:43.088  -->  00:10:45.541
We just want each one in a different corner,
214

214

00:10:45.541  -->  00:10:49.301
so, space between, so all we have to do is reload
215

215

00:10:49.301  -->  00:10:50.521
and here we go,
216

216

00:10:50.521  -->  00:10:53.182
so, I hope that made a lot of sense to you, okay?
217

217

00:10:53.182  -->  00:10:56.928
So, we had to change the flex direction from row to column,
218

218

00:10:56.928  -->  00:10:59.282
so that we could use the justify content in a
219

219

00:10:59.282  -->  00:11:00.855
different direction, than the one
220

220

00:11:00.855  -->  00:11:03.058
that we were used to doing it, okay?
221

221

00:11:03.058  -->  00:11:05.312
So, up here, for example, we used justify content
222

222

00:11:05.312  -->  00:11:06.912
from the left to the right
223

223

00:11:06.912  -->  00:11:09.130
and here, we used it from the top to the bottom,
224

224

00:11:09.130  -->  00:11:12.129
because we rotate it to flex direction, okay
225

225

00:11:12.129  -->  00:11:14.663
and so, that is a technique you should always
226

226

00:11:14.663  -->  00:11:17.292
keep in mind, because it's one that can be really useful
227

227

00:11:17.292  -->  00:11:19.341
for your own projects, as well.
228

228

00:11:19.341  -->  00:11:20.916
All right, so, now all we have to do
229

229

00:11:20.916  -->  00:11:22.870
is to style this navigation here,
230

230

00:11:22.870  -->  00:11:26.195
because this looks like quite unfinished, yet, right?
231

231

00:11:26.195  -->  00:11:28.443
And we're gonna leave that, to the next lecture
232

232

00:11:28.443  -->  00:11:30.110
after a quick break.
