00:00:01.205  -->  00:00:02.367
<v Instructor>Hey there.</v>
2

2

00:00:02.367  -->  00:00:05.412
Great to see that you're still with me in this project.
3

3

00:00:05.412  -->  00:00:08.781
Now it's time to build the user reviews.
4

4

00:00:08.781  -->  00:00:11.667
And so, we're just gonna continue using and practicing
5

5

00:00:11.667  -->  00:00:14.584
our flexbox skills in this lecture.
6

6

00:00:16.133  -->  00:00:18.145
And this is what the reviews look like.
7

7

00:00:18.145  -->  00:00:20.858
So, each review has this white box here
8

8

00:00:20.858  -->  00:00:24.454
with a text on the top and then the user image,
9

9

00:00:24.454  -->  00:00:28.113
the name, the date and the rating of this user.
10

10

00:00:28.113  -->  00:00:30.899
Then also we have like this quote symbol here
11

11

00:00:30.899  -->  00:00:33.183
in the top to make it look a bit better.
12

12

00:00:33.183  -->  00:00:35.821
And we're also gonna put that here in the end.
13

13

00:00:35.821  -->  00:00:39.269
But for now, let's focus on this review box here.
14

14

00:00:39.269  -->  00:00:43.019
Okay, so let's start with the HTML once more.
15

15

00:00:44.413  -->  00:00:47.996
And it's down here in the user reviews box.
16

16

00:00:49.556  -->  00:00:50.473
So, review.
17

17

00:00:51.313  -->  00:00:53.547
And each of these small review boxes
18

18

00:00:53.547  -->  00:00:55.516
will be one review component.
19

19

00:00:55.516  -->  00:00:59.415
So review, and then in there we have the review text.
20

20

00:00:59.415  -->  00:01:02.265
And actually I don't want to use development here.
21

21

00:01:02.265  -->  00:01:04.602
But I want to use a figure.
22

22

00:01:04.602  -->  00:01:06.935
So the figure HTML5 element.
23

23

00:01:07.875  -->  00:01:12.014
And actually, figures in HTML5 are perfect for reviews.
24

24

00:01:12.014  -->  00:01:13.759
So some people think that figures
25

25

00:01:13.759  -->  00:01:15.881
are only for pictures or for images,
26

26

00:01:15.881  -->  00:01:17.738
but that's not really true.
27

27

00:01:17.738  -->  00:01:20.336
Figures are great for some text and descriptions
28

28

00:01:20.336  -->  00:01:21.432
of the images.
29

29

00:01:21.432  -->  00:01:24.878
And so, a figure is perfect here for our review.
30

30

00:01:24.878  -->  00:01:29.045
Now, in here, let's use the block quote element now.
31

31

00:01:30.171  -->  00:01:33.328
Because in fact review is like a quote from the person.
32

32

00:01:33.328  -->  00:01:36.030
And so, block quote is a perfect HTML5
33

33

00:01:36.030  -->  00:01:37.863
element for this case.
34

34

00:01:38.701  -->  00:01:42.467
So, review, text is what I want to call it.
35

35

00:01:42.467  -->  00:01:44.752
And then once again let's get a text here
36

36

00:01:44.752  -->  00:01:46.335
from our text file.
37

37

00:01:48.707  -->  00:01:50.576
And then paste it here.
38

38

00:01:50.576  -->  00:01:53.409
And then we have the fake caption.
39

39

00:01:56.754  -->  00:01:59.087
Which is called review user.
40

40

00:01:59.957  -->  00:02:01.958
And this is basically the container
41

41

00:02:01.958  -->  00:02:04.136
which will hold the user's image,
42

42

00:02:04.136  -->  00:02:07.340
the name, the date, and the rating.
43

43

00:02:07.340  -->  00:02:11.173
Right, so first the image called review photo.
44

44

00:02:14.818  -->  00:02:17.827
And this is the user one right now.
45

45

00:02:17.827  -->  00:02:18.910
So, user one.
46

46

00:02:20.845  -->  00:02:22.934
So, the image, and now we need a box
47

47

00:02:22.934  -->  00:02:26.057
which is then gonna hold the name and the date.
48

48

00:02:26.057  -->  00:02:27.724
So just a div review
49

49

00:02:31.390  -->  00:02:33.499
user box is what I'm calling this one.
50

50

00:02:33.499  -->  00:02:36.832
So this box basically is like a box here
51

51

00:02:37.873  -->  00:02:41.373
like this which holds then the name and the date.
52

52

00:02:41.373  -->  00:02:44.790
So I'm gonna put these two in paragraphs.
53

53

00:02:47.990  -->  00:02:52.157
Review user name, and the first one is called Nick Smith.
54

54

00:02:53.835  -->  00:02:55.085
And then review
55

55

00:02:58.152  -->  00:02:58.985
user date.
56

56

00:03:00.270  -->  00:03:01.437
February 23rd,
57

57

00:03:05.082  -->  00:03:05.915
2017.
58

58

00:03:07.025  -->  00:03:10.942
All right, and then finally we have the rating.
59

59

00:03:14.675  -->  00:03:17.084
And this guy gave 7.8 out of 10.
60

60

00:03:17.084  -->  00:03:19.571
So a pretty good hotel apparently.
61

61

00:03:19.571  -->  00:03:21.494
Okay, and that's it for the review.
62

62

00:03:21.494  -->  00:03:24.189
So again, we have the text, then we have the user
63

63

00:03:24.189  -->  00:03:26.663
containing the photo, the name
64

64

00:03:26.663  -->  00:03:27.854
and the date.
65

65

00:03:27.854  -->  00:03:30.229
And then we have the rating as well.
66

66

00:03:30.229  -->  00:03:33.062
All right, so, that is one review.
67

67

00:03:35.165  -->  00:03:38.199
And then we have another one.
68

68

00:03:38.199  -->  00:03:41.065
So let's get the text for that one.
69

69

00:03:41.065  -->  00:03:43.065
And we can now close it.
70

70

00:03:47.086  -->  00:03:48.503
From Mary Thomas.
71

71

00:03:52.720  -->  00:03:55.007
Now I'm gonna use this short cut here again
72

72

00:03:55.007  -->  00:03:57.340
for expanding the selection.
73

73

00:03:58.179  -->  00:03:59.929
September 13th, 2017.
74

74

00:04:03.002  -->  00:04:05.669
And the rating she gave was 9.3.
75

75

00:04:07.038  -->  00:04:09.564
Okay, so that is our markup.
76

76

00:04:09.564  -->  00:04:12.502
Let's take a look at that.
77

77

00:04:12.502  -->  00:04:16.189
Actually, we forgot to change image here.
78

78

00:04:16.189  -->  00:04:18.189
So this one is user two.
79

79

00:04:20.556  -->  00:04:22.473
Okay, so that's better.
80

80

00:04:24.948  -->  00:04:28.076
So, let's now go to our components here,
81

81

00:04:28.076  -->  00:04:30.993
and then start dialing all of that.
82

82

00:04:35.075  -->  00:04:36.069
So, reviews.
83

83

00:04:36.069  -->  00:04:38.659
Now, first of all, let's get rid here of course
84

84

00:04:38.659  -->  00:04:40.742
of this background color.
85

85

00:04:47.893  -->  00:04:49.266
And now the review.
86

86

00:04:49.266  -->  00:04:50.679
Once more, I'm gonna start by putting
87

87

00:04:50.679  -->  00:04:52.846
all of the selectors here.
88

88

00:04:54.357  -->  00:04:55.440
So, the text,
89

89

00:04:57.752  -->  00:04:59.085
the review user.
90

90

00:05:02.761  -->  00:05:04.594
Then the review photo.
91

91

00:05:05.491  -->  00:05:07.561
And let's see what else we have.
92

92

00:05:07.561  -->  00:05:09.684
So, text, user photo.
93

93

00:05:09.684  -->  00:05:11.361
And then we have the user box, user name,
94

94

00:05:11.361  -->  00:05:13.111
user date and rating.
95

95

00:05:23.027  -->  00:05:24.110
So, user box.
96

96

00:05:26.712  -->  00:05:27.545
User name.
97

97

00:05:33.805  -->  00:05:36.638
User date, and finally the rating.
98

98

00:05:39.899  -->  00:05:42.793
So let's start here with the review.
99

99

00:05:42.793  -->  00:05:45.793
Give it a background color of white.
100

100

00:05:48.313  -->  00:05:49.992
And we also wanted to have the box shadow
101

101

00:05:49.992  -->  00:05:51.634
like the other box.
102

102

00:05:51.634  -->  00:05:53.305
And so, remember that we already declared
103

103

00:05:53.305  -->  00:05:57.472
a variable for that, and that one is called shadow light.
104

104

00:06:01.392  -->  00:06:05.140
We wanted to have a padding of three rim,
105

105

00:06:05.140  -->  00:06:08.473
and a margin at the bottom of three rim.
106

106

00:06:10.682  -->  00:06:13.330
Well, let's put 3.5 actually to give it more
107

107

00:06:13.330  -->  00:06:15.249
breathing space here.
108

108

00:06:15.249  -->  00:06:16.372
Okay.
109

109

00:06:16.372  -->  00:06:18.993
So that should look pretty good already.
110

110

00:06:18.993  -->  00:06:21.576
All right, now let's just make the image here
111

111

00:06:21.576  -->  00:06:24.538
smaller and round already so that it doesn't
112

112

00:06:24.538  -->  00:06:26.288
occupy so much space.
113

113

00:06:27.527  -->  00:06:30.944
And I want a height and width of 4.5 rem.
114

114

00:06:38.728  -->  00:06:41.765
And, of course, make them round.
115

115

00:06:41.765  -->  00:06:45.181
Right, now as for the font size,
116

116

00:06:45.181  -->  00:06:47.404
let's actually define it on the parent element
117

117

00:06:47.404  -->  00:06:49.665
so that all of these texts here
118

118

00:06:49.665  -->  00:06:51.749
can then inherent that.
119

119

00:06:51.749  -->  00:06:54.038
So let's set that to 14 pixels,
120

120

00:06:54.038  -->  00:06:57.656
and we can do that here in the user reviews.
121

121

00:06:57.656  -->  00:06:59.469
So, font size 1.4.
122

122

00:06:59.469  -->  00:07:02.531
And instead of having it here in both the description
123

123

00:07:02.531  -->  00:07:04.253
and the user reviews, we can actually put it
124

124

00:07:04.253  -->  00:07:06.242
on the parent of both of these.
125

125

00:07:06.242  -->  00:07:08.711
And that is here, the detail.
126

126

00:07:08.711  -->  00:07:10.911
Okay, so now we say that the detail container
127

127

00:07:10.911  -->  00:07:14.098
should have 1.4 font size and then all the elements
128

128

00:07:14.098  -->  00:07:16.347
in both the description and the user reviews
129

129

00:07:16.347  -->  00:07:18.514
are going to inherit that.
130

130

00:07:20.039  -->  00:07:22.056
So let's actually take that out.
131

131

00:07:22.056  -->  00:07:24.354
And yep, so here we go.
132

132

00:07:24.354  -->  00:07:26.400
Now, next up, we should format
133

133

00:07:26.400  -->  00:07:28.516
all of this content here.
134

134

00:07:28.516  -->  00:07:31.689
So we want it to look like this.
135

135

00:07:31.689  -->  00:07:34.363
And now I think it's time for a small challenge for you.
136

136

00:07:34.363  -->  00:07:36.071
So I want you to pause the video
137

137

00:07:36.071  -->  00:07:38.639
and try to format this on yourself, okay?
138

138

00:07:38.639  -->  00:07:40.637
So of course you're going to use flexbox,
139

139

00:07:40.637  -->  00:07:42.259
but I want you to try it out for yourself
140

140

00:07:42.259  -->  00:07:44.865
to use these properties and use everything you've learned
141

141

00:07:44.865  -->  00:07:47.169
so far to format this content to look
142

142

00:07:47.169  -->  00:07:48.653
like we have it here.
143

143

00:07:48.653  -->  00:07:50.721
So that shouldn't be all too difficult.
144

144

00:07:50.721  -->  00:07:52.475
So please pause the video right now.
145

145

00:07:52.475  -->  00:07:54.808
And I'll be waiting for you.
146

146

00:07:56.104  -->  00:07:58.719
All right, did you manage to get that to work?
147

147

00:07:58.719  -->  00:08:01.067
Well, I'm gonna give you the solution right now.
148

148

00:08:01.067  -->  00:08:04.400
So let's see if you did it the same way as I did it.
149

149

00:08:04.400  -->  00:08:07.498
So, first of all, what should be our flex container?
150

150

00:08:07.498  -->  00:08:09.912
And, of course, that's the user element.
151

151

00:08:09.912  -->  00:08:12.079
Right, so the review user.
152

152

00:08:13.619  -->  00:08:17.099
So, display flex, and then since we're here,
153

153

00:08:17.099  -->  00:08:20.752
we can already align the items vertically.
154

154

00:08:20.752  -->  00:08:23.169
Okay, so align items, center.
155

155

00:08:26.215  -->  00:08:28.896
So that will already make a huge difference.
156

156

00:08:28.896  -->  00:08:32.321
Okay, now let's just give this paragraph here
157

157

00:08:32.321  -->  00:08:34.488
some margin to the bottom.
158

158

00:08:36.315  -->  00:08:39.198
So, margin bottom to rim.
159

159

00:08:39.198  -->  00:08:41.143
So that's better.
160

160

00:08:41.143  -->  00:08:43.210
Now, the next step is to just basically
161

161

00:08:43.210  -->  00:08:45.208
push this part here so the rating
162

162

00:08:45.208  -->  00:08:47.593
all the way to the right side.
163

163

00:08:47.593  -->  00:08:50.186
Okay, so how did you manage to do that?
164

164

00:08:50.186  -->  00:08:52.529
Well, I hope it was with margin auto.
165

165

00:08:52.529  -->  00:08:54.529
Okay, so just like this.
166

166

00:08:56.398  -->  00:08:59.231
Margin, and actually margin right,
167

167

00:09:00.583  -->  00:09:01.585
set to auto.
168

168

00:09:01.585  -->  00:09:04.482
Because remember that the user box is exactly that.
169

169

00:09:04.482  -->  00:09:07.068
So user box is the element containing
170

170

00:09:07.068  -->  00:09:08.832
both the name and the date.
171

171

00:09:08.832  -->  00:09:11.486
So we want the image, then we want the user box.
172

172

00:09:11.486  -->  00:09:14.064
And then we want that space so that the rating
173

173

00:09:14.064  -->  00:09:16.380
is pushed all the way to the right side.
174

174

00:09:16.380  -->  00:09:21.179
And so, on user box, we set margin right to auto.
175

175

00:09:21.179  -->  00:09:24.282
Okay, and so, that's exactly what we want here.
176

176

00:09:24.282  -->  00:09:26.310
So just a little bit of flexbox.
177

177

00:09:26.310  -->  00:09:27.956
And that's already enough to make everything
178

178

00:09:27.956  -->  00:09:29.611
look like this.
179

179

00:09:29.611  -->  00:09:30.914
Now, all we need is some margin
180

180

00:09:30.914  -->  00:09:32.489
to the right of this image here
181

181

00:09:32.489  -->  00:09:34.870
and then a little formatting here on the text.
182

182

00:09:34.870  -->  00:09:37.993
But that shouldn't be all too hard as well.
183

183

00:09:37.993  -->  00:09:42.356
So, photo just a small margin to the right.
184

184

00:09:42.356  -->  00:09:43.439
Like 1.5 rem.
185

185

00:09:44.716  -->  00:09:46.203
And now the user name.
186

186

00:09:46.203  -->  00:09:49.703
We want it to have a font size of 1.1 rem.
187

187

00:09:50.583  -->  00:09:54.812
And a font weight of 600 in order to make it bold.
188

188

00:09:54.812  -->  00:09:58.387
All right, also the text transform should be
189

189

00:09:58.387  -->  00:10:02.304
to upper case and a small margin to the bottom.
190

190

00:10:06.373  -->  00:10:08.276
Just like four pixels.
191

191

00:10:08.276  -->  00:10:09.859
Then the user date,
192

192

00:10:11.710  -->  00:10:15.331
font size of one rem, so 10 pixels,
193

193

00:10:15.331  -->  00:10:17.748
and a slightly lighter color.
194

194

00:10:22.213  -->  00:10:24.630
So, color, gray, dark, three.
195

195

00:10:26.110  -->  00:10:28.036
And finally the rating.
196

196

00:10:28.036  -->  00:10:31.786
So remember that this one has our pink color,
197

197

00:10:36.711  -->  00:10:40.850
a bigger font size, so 2.2 rem, for example.
198

198

00:10:40.850  -->  00:10:44.350
And then a smaller font, white, of course,
199

199

00:10:45.550  -->  00:10:47.190
to compensate that okay,
200

200

00:10:47.190  -->  00:10:50.137
and that should be really good already.
201

201

00:10:50.137  -->  00:10:51.570
And, yeah, it is.
202

202

00:10:51.570  -->  00:10:53.820
So, that looks pretty great I think, right?
203

203

00:10:53.820  -->  00:10:56.555
And so, we're already almost done here.
204

204

00:10:56.555  -->  00:10:59.027
Actually, let me just show you what's missing here.
205

205

00:10:59.027  -->  00:11:01.305
And that is this quotation mark here.
206

206

00:11:01.305  -->  00:11:03.923
So this big, huge quotation mark.
207

207

00:11:03.923  -->  00:11:07.416
And actually, we will do this with a before pseudoelement.
208

208

00:11:07.416  -->  00:11:11.691
So, not being in the HTML, but just in a CSS.
209

209

00:11:11.691  -->  00:11:14.375
All right, so we make a pseudoelement here
210

210

00:11:14.375  -->  00:11:16.569
before the review.
211

211

00:11:16.569  -->  00:11:19.819
So we can put it here right at the end.
212

212

00:11:22.633  -->  00:11:24.287
And before.
213

213

00:11:24.287  -->  00:11:27.100
So this will just create a small element.
214

214

00:11:27.100  -->  00:11:29.310
And now the content that we want here
215

215

00:11:29.310  -->  00:11:31.219
is not empty.
216

216

00:11:31.219  -->  00:11:34.262
But instead we want it to have that quotation mark.
217

217

00:11:34.262  -->  00:11:36.416
And so, in here, we now have to use
218

218

00:11:36.416  -->  00:11:39.666
one of these special symbols like an HTML entity.
219

219

00:11:39.666  -->  00:11:42.941
Okay, now, it works slightly different in CSS.
220

220

00:11:42.941  -->  00:11:45.240
But let me show you to you.
221

221

00:11:45.240  -->  00:11:49.407
So, let's look for a table of these HTML entities.
222

222

00:11:52.387  -->  00:11:55.050
And the one I like is from CSS tricks.
223

223

00:11:55.050  -->  00:11:57.689
Let me see if I find it here somewhere.
224

224

00:11:57.689  -->  00:12:00.022
Let me put it here actually.
225

225

00:12:02.482  -->  00:12:05.482
And so, probably it's this one here.
226

226

00:12:06.527  -->  00:12:08.481
Yeah, exactly, so this one here's the one
227

227

00:12:08.481  -->  00:12:11.544
that I have on my reference page.
228

228

00:12:11.544  -->  00:12:13.473
Okay, so if you want the link to that one,
229

229

00:12:13.473  -->  00:12:15.320
you can just check out my reference page
230

230

00:12:15.320  -->  00:12:16.903
at jonas.io, right?
231

231

00:12:18.634  -->  00:12:22.801
So, down here somewhere, we have the quotation mark.
232

232

00:12:26.352  -->  00:12:27.852
Well, where is it?
233

233

00:12:29.054  -->  00:12:30.865
Now we have the Greek symbols.
234

234

00:12:30.865  -->  00:12:34.320
So, you see there are a lot of symbols available.
235

235

00:12:34.320  -->  00:12:36.719
And here, so actually this here is the one
236

236

00:12:36.719  -->  00:12:38.611
that we want, all right?
237

237

00:12:38.611  -->  00:12:39.846
And so, you see that in HTML,
238

238

00:12:39.846  -->  00:12:41.964
we use it like this here.
239

239

00:12:41.964  -->  00:12:44.863
So this code, or of course this here, so left
240

240

00:12:44.863  -->  00:12:47.758
double quotation mark, with just the name
241

241

00:12:47.758  -->  00:12:48.742
of the symbol.
242

242

00:12:48.742  -->  00:12:51.062
Now, in CSS, we do it slightly different,
243

243

00:12:51.062  -->  00:12:54.585
as I was saying, because we use this ISO number.
244

244

00:12:54.585  -->  00:12:57.840
And the ISO number for this is this one.
245

245

00:12:57.840  -->  00:12:59.888
So all we have to do is to copy this number here
246

246

00:12:59.888  -->  00:13:01.817
to get the symbol.
247

247

00:13:01.817  -->  00:13:04.825
So we can now close this actually.
248

248

00:13:04.825  -->  00:13:08.126
Or I'm just gonna leave it open.
249

249

00:13:08.126  -->  00:13:09.910
And, yeah, here we go.
250

250

00:13:09.910  -->  00:13:13.201
So let's take a look at that in our markup actually.
251

251

00:13:13.201  -->  00:13:16.063
And so, yeah, here we go, so it's already there.
252

252

00:13:16.063  -->  00:13:18.123
Now, of course, it shouldn't look like this.
253

253

00:13:18.123  -->  00:13:21.635
So we have to do some changes to that obviously.
254

254

00:13:21.635  -->  00:13:24.435
So we're gonna position this one with absolute positioning
255

255

00:13:24.435  -->  00:13:27.726
right in the corner of the element.
256

256

00:13:27.726  -->  00:13:29.559
So, position absolute.
257

257

00:13:30.566  -->  00:13:33.956
And then never forget to define the position
258

258

00:13:33.956  -->  00:13:35.789
on the parent as well.
259

259

00:13:36.975  -->  00:13:39.225
So, position relative here.
260

260

00:13:42.112  -->  00:13:45.390
Then, from the top, let's move it two rem up
261

261

00:13:45.390  -->  00:13:49.557
and to the right, let's move it one rem to the left side.
262

262

00:13:51.503  -->  00:13:53.350
Okay, so in the negative direction.
263

263

00:13:53.350  -->  00:13:54.720
We're gonna play around with that later
264

264

00:13:54.720  -->  00:13:56.766
to position it in the correct position.
265

265

00:13:56.766  -->  00:13:58.965
But for now let's increase it at that.
266

266

00:13:58.965  -->  00:14:00.749
Then we should also increase the font size
267

267

00:14:00.749  -->  00:14:02.949
because it was really small.
268

268

00:14:02.949  -->  00:14:04.199
So like 20 rem.
269

269

00:14:06.197  -->  00:14:09.530
And it should have a lighter color.
270

270

00:14:09.530  -->  00:14:10.780
So, color gray,
271

271

00:14:13.762  -->  00:14:14.595
light two.
272

272

00:14:16.307  -->  00:14:19.733
And let's see how it looks like right now.
273

273

00:14:19.733  -->  00:14:21.633
Oh, so it's right here now.
274

274

00:14:21.633  -->  00:14:22.993
So something is not really right.
275

275

00:14:22.993  -->  00:14:25.660
Let's just inspect this element.
276

276

00:14:27.192  -->  00:14:29.101
All right, whoa, what's going on here?
277

277

00:14:29.101  -->  00:14:31.838
So you see that it's huge, first of all.
278

278

00:14:31.838  -->  00:14:34.468
And that's because of the line height of this element.
279

279

00:14:34.468  -->  00:14:37.561
So we should really set it to one or zero.
280

280

00:14:37.561  -->  00:14:39.114
And also the problem is that I set it here
281

281

00:14:39.114  -->  00:14:41.388
from the right, and it should of course be
282

282

00:14:41.388  -->  00:14:42.763
on the left side.
283

283

00:14:42.763  -->  00:14:45.719
Plus, you can see that this is not really
284

284

00:14:45.719  -->  00:14:47.087
looking the way we want.
285

285

00:14:47.087  -->  00:14:50.420
And so, first of all, let's change that.
286

286

00:14:51.879  -->  00:14:53.419
So, the font family.
287

287

00:14:53.419  -->  00:14:56.693
And let's just set it to a sans serif font.
288

288

00:14:56.693  -->  00:14:58.101
Because right now it's inheriting
289

289

00:14:58.101  -->  00:14:59.719
our open sans font.
290

290

00:14:59.719  -->  00:15:02.171
But that doesn't really look so great.
291

291

00:15:02.171  -->  00:15:04.163
Let's just use the default sans serif font
292

292

00:15:04.163  -->  00:15:06.069
on the browser.
293

293

00:15:06.069  -->  00:15:07.611
Now, next up, as I was saying,
294

294

00:15:07.611  -->  00:15:10.528
let's decrease the line height here
295

295

00:15:11.513  -->  00:15:14.872
to one, and then here of course it should be left
296

296

00:15:14.872  -->  00:15:16.039
and not right.
297

297

00:15:19.363  -->  00:15:21.476
Okay, so that's already looking much better.
298

298

00:15:21.476  -->  00:15:23.548
Let's take a look at this one.
299

299

00:15:23.548  -->  00:15:26.501
And actually it should be a bit more up.
300

300

00:15:26.501  -->  00:15:28.501
Okay, so, let's do that.
301

301

00:15:31.196  -->  00:15:33.446
So top, let's say like 0.75
302

302

00:15:35.134  -->  00:15:37.944
and see if it moves up a bit like that.
303

303

00:15:37.944  -->  00:15:39.595
All right, and it does.
304

304

00:15:39.595  -->  00:15:41.535
And now just two small problems,
305

305

00:15:41.535  -->  00:15:44.432
you see that it's overflowing the box here, first of all.
306

306

00:15:44.432  -->  00:15:46.358
So it's moving outside of the box.
307

307

00:15:46.358  -->  00:15:48.218
And we of course don't want that.
308

308

00:15:48.218  -->  00:15:49.961
And the second problem is that it's also
309

309

00:15:49.961  -->  00:15:51.697
on top of this text.
310

310

00:15:51.697  -->  00:15:54.947
And so, we can fix that with a Z index.
311

311

00:15:55.877  -->  00:16:00.288
So let's, first of all, set a smaller Z index on this one.
312

312

00:16:00.288  -->  00:16:04.205
So one, and then on the text, a higher Z index.
313

313

00:16:05.617  -->  00:16:06.784
Z index of 10.
314

314

00:16:08.084  -->  00:16:09.630
And never forget the Z index only works
315

315

00:16:09.630  -->  00:16:12.027
if you set the position.
316

316

00:16:12.027  -->  00:16:14.174
Okay, no matter what it is, you have to set
317

317

00:16:14.174  -->  00:16:17.057
the position, until we're simply using relative here.
318

318

00:16:17.057  -->  00:16:19.032
Now, about their overflowing parts,
319

319

00:16:19.032  -->  00:16:21.608
that's also very easy to fix.
320

320

00:16:21.608  -->  00:16:25.307
So, we did that before a couple of times.
321

321

00:16:25.307  -->  00:16:28.336
All we have to do is set overflow to hidden.
322

322

00:16:28.336  -->  00:16:30.865
And so, now these two problems should be fixed.
323

323

00:16:30.865  -->  00:16:32.965
And here we go, now it works.
324

324

00:16:32.965  -->  00:16:35.763
It's no longer overflowing, and the text is on top
325

325

00:16:35.763  -->  00:16:39.210
of the icon, of this small symbol.
326

326

00:16:39.210  -->  00:16:41.267
Okay, and so, it looks great.
327

327

00:16:41.267  -->  00:16:44.579
All that's missing now really is this button here
328

328

00:16:44.579  -->  00:16:46.200
with this hover effect.
329

329

00:16:46.200  -->  00:16:48.796
So, you have this small effect where
330

330

00:16:48.796  -->  00:16:51.464
as soon as you hover it, it creates a small space
331

331

00:16:51.464  -->  00:16:54.834
between the show all and this arrow here.
332

332

00:16:54.834  -->  00:16:59.001
So let's go do that and add that small button to our HTML.
333

333

00:17:00.667  -->  00:17:02.436
And actually we already colored up that button.
334

334

00:17:02.436  -->  00:17:04.839
So it shouldn't be a lot of work.
335

335

00:17:04.839  -->  00:17:07.368
Now, where did we put this one?
336

336

00:17:07.368  -->  00:17:11.128
So figure, figure, yeah, so here after this figure.
337

337

00:17:11.128  -->  00:17:14.336
So, button, and then remember that we
338

338

00:17:14.336  -->  00:17:16.336
called it button inline.
339

339

00:17:17.633  -->  00:17:22.457
Show all, and now that small arrow that I showed you.
340

340

00:17:22.457  -->  00:17:24.977
And this one should be inside of a span element.
341

341

00:17:24.977  -->  00:17:27.608
And that's simply because we then want
342

342

00:17:27.608  -->  00:17:30.109
to have that small animation effect that I showed you
343

343

00:17:30.109  -->  00:17:33.532
where the text moves away from the arrow.
344

344

00:17:33.532  -->  00:17:35.762
So, the HTML symbol for that arrow is
345

345

00:17:35.762  -->  00:17:39.054
arr and then R, or right arrow.
346

346

00:17:39.054  -->  00:17:41.387
So let's check that one out.
347

347

00:17:42.278  -->  00:17:43.518
And so, here we go.
348

348

00:17:43.518  -->  00:17:45.900
Now all we have to do is of course center it.
349

349

00:17:45.900  -->  00:17:48.065
But let's leave that for a bit later.
350

350

00:17:48.065  -->  00:17:49.630
And so, what we want to focus on now
351

351

00:17:49.630  -->  00:17:51.380
is that hover effect.
352

352

00:17:52.591  -->  00:17:56.758
So, let's go back to our components and to that button,
353

353

00:17:59.513  -->  00:18:03.034
which is here, and then code it up.
354

354

00:18:03.034  -->  00:18:06.201
So, we basically have a span in there.
355

355

00:18:07.277  -->  00:18:09.169
And all that this span needs
356

356

00:18:09.169  -->  00:18:12.425
is just a small margin to the left side.
357

357

00:18:12.425  -->  00:18:14.677
So like three pixels, for example.
358

358

00:18:14.677  -->  00:18:18.594
Okay, and then as soon as we hover the element.
359

359

00:18:20.805  -->  00:18:22.730
So, hover and then span.
360

360

00:18:22.730  -->  00:18:26.897
And actually we could put it here in this one, right?
361

361

00:18:30.943  -->  00:18:32.539
So when this one is hovered here,
362

362

00:18:32.539  -->  00:18:35.017
then the span that is in there should increase
363

363

00:18:35.017  -->  00:18:38.684
its margin left to, let's say, eight pixels.
364

364

00:18:40.235  -->  00:18:43.222
And so, now again since these are really small numbers,
365

365

00:18:43.222  -->  00:18:44.954
I'm just using pixels here and not really
366

366

00:18:44.954  -->  00:18:46.287
focusing on rem.
367

367

00:18:47.321  -->  00:18:50.047
Now all we have to do is animate this.
368

368

00:18:50.047  -->  00:18:54.034
So transition of 0.2 seconds and that's it.
369

369

00:18:54.034  -->  00:18:55.825
We should now be good to go.
370

370

00:18:55.825  -->  00:18:57.658
So let's try that out.
371

371

00:18:59.721  -->  00:19:01.352
And, yeah, it's happening.
372

372

00:19:01.352  -->  00:19:03.217
Now, what's not working 100% here
373

373

00:19:03.217  -->  00:19:05.609
is changing the color when we hover.
374

374

00:19:05.609  -->  00:19:07.892
So, first the animation happens where it moves,
375

375

00:19:07.892  -->  00:19:10.459
and only then the color of the span changes.
376

376

00:19:10.459  -->  00:19:12.970
So take a look at that.
377

377

00:19:12.970  -->  00:19:14.580
So that's a bit weird.
378

378

00:19:14.580  -->  00:19:17.367
So let's take a look at what's going on here.
379

379

00:19:17.367  -->  00:19:21.534
Maybe we should just change this all here to margin left.
380

380

00:19:22.746  -->  00:19:26.037
Okay, 'cause we already have this all up here.
381

381

00:19:26.037  -->  00:19:30.472
So maybe that's making this weird behavior happening.
382

382

00:19:30.472  -->  00:19:32.273
And, yeah, it's better now.
383

383

00:19:32.273  -->  00:19:33.882
Now all we have left to do is to center
384

384

00:19:33.882  -->  00:19:36.406
this button here in this container.
385

385

00:19:36.406  -->  00:19:38.760
So how could we do that?
386

386

00:19:38.760  -->  00:19:41.445
Well, the easiest way would probably be to just set
387

387

00:19:41.445  -->  00:19:44.432
text align to center on the container.
388

388

00:19:44.432  -->  00:19:47.997
So, let me show that to you and show you why
389

389

00:19:47.997  -->  00:19:51.959
this is not really where we want to go.
390

390

00:19:51.959  -->  00:19:53.209
So, text align,
391

391

00:19:55.129  -->  00:19:55.962
center.
392

392

00:19:57.669  -->  00:20:00.741
And so, the button is centered, but so is
393

393

00:20:00.741  -->  00:20:03.260
all of this text here.
394

394

00:20:03.260  -->  00:20:06.895
Because this property is inherited by all of these elements.
395

395

00:20:06.895  -->  00:20:10.010
And so, now all of them have their text centered.
396

396

00:20:10.010  -->  00:20:12.204
So that's not really the best solution.
397

397

00:20:12.204  -->  00:20:15.981
So why not use flexbox to center this element here?
398

398

00:20:15.981  -->  00:20:18.169
We have a great property that centers stuff
399

399

00:20:18.169  -->  00:20:19.826
along the cross axis.
400

400

00:20:19.826  -->  00:20:22.126
And that's align items.
401

401

00:20:22.126  -->  00:20:23.780
So all we have to do is to set
402

402

00:20:23.780  -->  00:20:26.756
the container to flex then change the direction,
403

403

00:20:26.756  -->  00:20:29.713
and then use align items and set it to center.
404

404

00:20:29.713  -->  00:20:31.461
And then it's going to are center
405

405

00:20:31.461  -->  00:20:33.586
this button here horizontally.
406

406

00:20:33.586  -->  00:20:35.586
Right, so let's do that.
407

407

00:20:38.524  -->  00:20:41.346
So display, flex, and now we have to change
408

408

00:20:41.346  -->  00:20:42.930
the direction of course.
409

409

00:20:42.930  -->  00:20:46.384
Because if we didn't, then it would look like this.
410

410

00:20:46.384  -->  00:20:49.026
So, that's not what we want at all.
411

411

00:20:49.026  -->  00:20:51.691
So we want it to be one after the other.
412

412

00:20:51.691  -->  00:20:53.108
So flex direction
413

413

00:20:55.996  -->  00:20:59.628
column, and so that's what we want.
414

414

00:20:59.628  -->  00:21:02.811
And so, now they are one after another once again.
415

415

00:21:02.811  -->  00:21:05.674
Now, what you see happening here is that this element
416

416

00:21:05.674  -->  00:21:07.949
has this huge border here at the bottom.
417

417

00:21:07.949  -->  00:21:09.900
Going from one side to the other.
418

418

00:21:09.900  -->  00:21:13.131
And I want you to think about why that happens.
419

419

00:21:13.131  -->  00:21:16.050
So, can you tell why this is happening?
420

420

00:21:16.050  -->  00:21:17.667
Well, this is something that actually has been
421

421

00:21:17.667  -->  00:21:19.513
happening all the time.
422

422

00:21:19.513  -->  00:21:21.540
And it's the fact that the align items property
423

423

00:21:21.540  -->  00:21:24.860
is set to stretch because remember that right now
424

424

00:21:24.860  -->  00:21:28.772
this is the main axis going from top to bottom.
425

425

00:21:28.772  -->  00:21:31.938
And this is here is the cross axis.
426

426

00:21:31.938  -->  00:21:35.725
And so, that's where the align items property is applying.
427

427

00:21:35.725  -->  00:21:37.828
And since its default is to stretch,
428

428

00:21:37.828  -->  00:21:40.126
this button here is not stretching all the way
429

429

00:21:40.126  -->  00:21:42.746
from this side to this side.
430

430

00:21:42.746  -->  00:21:45.345
So let's actually take a look at that.
431

431

00:21:45.345  -->  00:21:46.885
And here you go.
432

432

00:21:46.885  -->  00:21:48.561
So now it spans from the left side
433

433

00:21:48.561  -->  00:21:51.074
to the right side because of align items,
434

434

00:21:51.074  -->  00:21:52.475
set to stretch.
435

435

00:21:52.475  -->  00:21:53.958
And so, that's why this is happening.
436

436

00:21:53.958  -->  00:21:56.791
And so, let's change it to center.
437

437

00:21:58.960  -->  00:22:00.293
So, align items.
438

438

00:22:03.126  -->  00:22:03.959
Center.
439

439

00:22:05.943  -->  00:22:07.801
And so, that's exactly what we want.
440

440

00:22:07.801  -->  00:22:09.779
So now it's nicely centered once again
441

441

00:22:09.779  -->  00:22:11.946
with the power of flexbox.
442

442

00:22:13.821  -->  00:22:15.952
Okay, you see that this focused animation
443

443

00:22:15.952  -->  00:22:18.651
is also happening, just the way it was happening
444

444

00:22:18.651  -->  00:22:20.340
up here as well, right?
445

445

00:22:20.340  -->  00:22:24.651
And so, now if we compare it to our original,
446

446

00:22:24.651  -->  00:22:25.794
it looks just the same.
447

447

00:22:25.794  -->  00:22:29.276
And so, once again, we are done with this video.
448

448

00:22:29.276  -->  00:22:30.980
So, great, great job once again.
449

449

00:22:30.980  -->  00:22:33.194
So we are almost finished here.
450

450

00:22:33.194  -->  00:22:35.856
All that's left to do is to create this small
451

451

00:22:35.856  -->  00:22:38.042
tiny section down here.
452

452

00:22:38.042  -->  00:22:39.853
With this really cool button.
453

453

00:22:39.853  -->  00:22:43.291
So if you're curious about how we do this hover effect here,
454

454

00:22:43.291  -->  00:22:47.458
well, then just join me right now in the next lecture.
