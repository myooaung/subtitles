<v ->In this last part of the course,</v>

2

00:00:04,355  -->  00:00:06,683
I will teach you how to use the long awaited,
3

3

00:00:06,683  -->  00:00:09,338
brand new edition to the CSS language,
4

4

00:00:09,338  -->  00:00:11,708
which is the CSS Grid Layout module,
5

5

00:00:11,708  -->  00:00:14,100
or in short, just CSS Grids.
6

6

00:00:14,100  -->  00:00:18,577
So CSS Grids will allow you to build layouts so easily,
7

7

00:00:18,577  -->  00:00:20,620
like you've never done before.
8

8

00:00:20,620  -->  00:00:22,935
It really is a game changer for CSS,
9

9

00:00:22,935  -->  00:00:24,796
and that's why all the important experts
10

10

00:00:24,796  -->  00:00:26,952
are so excited about it.
11

11

00:00:26,952  -->  00:00:29,394
Now, for this section, I hope you're just as excited
12

12

00:00:29,394  -->  00:00:30,955
as they are.
13

13

00:00:30,955  -->  00:00:33,009
So just like in the Flexbox section,
14

14

00:00:33,009  -->  00:00:35,973
we will build yet another really cool project
15

15

00:00:35,973  -->  00:00:40,549
and this time, using all the power that CSS Grids offers us.
16

16

00:00:40,549  -->  00:00:42,940
We will also compare grids with Flexbox,
17

17

00:00:42,940  -->  00:00:44,636
and actually, we will use them together
18

18

00:00:44,636  -->  00:00:46,523
in some parts of the project
19

19

00:00:46,523  -->  00:00:49,561
because that's really becoming the standard these days.
20

20

00:00:49,561  -->  00:00:51,974
So yet another really cool section,
21

21

00:00:51,974  -->  00:00:54,234
and I can't wait to show you all of this.
22

22

00:00:54,234  -->  00:00:57,817
