00:00:01.121  -->  00:00:03.508
<v Jonas>So, in this first intro section to CSS grids,</v>
2

2

00:00:03.508  -->  00:00:06.244
we're gonna code up some examples to learn the basics,
3

3

00:00:06.244  -->  00:00:10.014
using CodePen, such as we did before in other sections.
4

4

00:00:10.014  -->  00:00:12.127
Now, what's new is that we're actually gonna use
5

5

00:00:12.127  -->  00:00:14.188
a new browser, instead of Google Chrome,
6

6

00:00:14.188  -->  00:00:16.398
and that's the new Firefox Quantum,
7

7

00:00:16.398  -->  00:00:19.138
which has, by far, the best dev tools to work
8

8

00:00:19.138  -->  00:00:20.856
with CSS grids.
9

9

00:00:20.856  -->  00:00:23.913
And this makes it a lot easier to visualize what's going on
10

10

00:00:23.913  -->  00:00:26.446
when we lay out our grids and so that's perfect
11

11

00:00:26.446  -->  00:00:28.443
for beginners like you.
12

12

00:00:28.443  -->  00:00:31.540
So, let's just head over here to mozilla.org,
13

13

00:00:31.540  -->  00:00:36.007
like I already have, and then download the new Firefox.
14

14

00:00:36.007  -->  00:00:38.986
I already did that, of course, and I played around a lot
15

15

00:00:38.986  -->  00:00:41.570
with the new dev tools with CSS grids here
16

16

00:00:41.570  -->  00:00:43.696
and, as I said, they are really great
17

17

00:00:43.696  -->  00:00:45.570
for working with grids.
18

18

00:00:45.570  -->  00:00:47.865
So the new Firefox browser is the first tool
19

19

00:00:47.865  -->  00:00:49.568
that we're gonna use throughout this course,
20

20

00:00:49.568  -->  00:00:51.541
instead of Google Chrome,
21

21

00:00:51.541  -->  00:00:54.289
and the second tool is, again, CodePen,
22

22

00:00:54.289  -->  00:00:55.856
as I was mentioning before.
23

23

00:00:55.856  -->  00:00:58.127
So, you already know that to create a new CodePen,
24

24

00:00:58.127  -->  00:01:01.594
you just head over to codepen.io/pen.
25

25

00:01:01.594  -->  00:01:04.222
It's then gonna ask you if you want to create a new account
26

26

00:01:04.222  -->  00:01:06.215
at some point, but that's not really necessary,
27

27

00:01:06.215  -->  00:01:08.888
if you just want to follow along with the videos
28

28

00:01:08.888  -->  00:01:10.513
and just save the code.
29

29

00:01:10.513  -->  00:01:11.914
But, if you want to create an account
30

30

00:01:11.914  -->  00:01:15.031
and make the editor look like this one like I have here,
31

31

00:01:15.031  -->  00:01:17.189
then it's best to create an account.
32

32

00:01:17.189  -->  00:01:19.722
So, just to show you the settings that I have here,
33

33

00:01:19.722  -->  00:01:21.719
so that you can make your CodePen look the same
34

34

00:01:21.719  -->  00:01:24.418
as mine here in the videos,
35

35

00:01:24.418  -->  00:01:27.551
I just head over here to the settings down here
36

36

00:01:27.551  -->  00:01:30.912
and so what I have here is the Oceanic Dark theme,
37

37

00:01:30.912  -->  00:01:34.616
together with the Source Code Pro font here
38

38

00:01:34.616  -->  00:01:37.428
and a 15-pixel font size, all right?
39

39

00:01:37.428  -->  00:01:39.606
And so that's gonna look like this example here
40

40

00:01:39.606  -->  00:01:41.145
on the right side.
41

41

00:01:41.145  -->  00:01:42.706
Then, down here, I didn't change anything,
42

42

00:01:42.706  -->  00:01:46.191
so this is just the default settings, all right?
43

43

00:01:46.191  -->  00:01:48.381
So, again, this last step here is not really necessary,
44

44

00:01:48.381  -->  00:01:51.458
if you don't want to make your CodePen look the same
45

45

00:01:51.458  -->  00:01:52.947
as mine, okay?
46

46

00:01:52.947  -->  00:01:53.953
What really matters is
47

47

00:01:53.953  -->  00:01:56.712
that you have the Firefox browser all installed and working,
48

48

00:01:56.712  -->  00:01:58.208
so that in the next lecture,
49

49

00:01:58.208  -->  00:02:01.764
we can start writing our first CSS grid code.
50

50

00:02:01.764  -->  00:02:03.761
All right, so are you excited for that?
51

51

00:02:03.761  -->  00:02:06.844
Then join me right in the next video.
