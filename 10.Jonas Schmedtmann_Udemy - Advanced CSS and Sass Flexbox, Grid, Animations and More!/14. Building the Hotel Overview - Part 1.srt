00:00:01,455  -->  00:00:02,850
<v Instructor>Welcome back.</v>
2

2

00:00:02,850  -->  00:00:06,362
I hope you're ready for the next part of our Trillo project,
3

3

00:00:06,362  -->  00:00:08,596
which will be the hotel overview
4

4

00:00:08,596  -->  00:00:11,947
So, in this section, the new things you will learn
5

5

00:00:11,947  -->  00:00:14,429
are how to create an infinite animation
6

6

00:00:14,429  -->  00:00:17,335
and also how to use the power of margin auto
7

7

00:00:17,335  -->  00:00:19,803
together with flexbox.
8

8

00:00:19,803  -->  00:00:22,861
And of course you're gonna continue using flexbox properties
9

9

00:00:22,861  -->  00:00:27,210
for easy positioning and alignment of our elements.
10

10

00:00:27,210  -->  00:00:30,760
So, the hotel overview is basically just this part here
11

11

00:00:30,760  -->  00:00:33,314
where we get a quick overview about the name,
12

12

00:00:33,314  -->  00:00:36,368
the stars and the location and then the average
13

13

00:00:36,368  -->  00:00:38,301
rating of the users.
14

14

00:00:38,301  -->  00:00:40,927
But before that, we also have these images here.
15

15

00:00:40,927  -->  00:00:43,562
Okay, and so, let's quickly start with that
16

16

00:00:43,562  -->  00:00:46,299
before we actually do the hotel overview.
17

17

00:00:46,299  -->  00:00:48,742
And that's just gonna take us like five minutes.
18

18

00:00:48,742  -->  00:00:51,334
So let's start with that.
19

19

00:00:51,334  -->  00:00:53,169
So right here in the hotel view,
20

20

00:00:53,169  -->  00:00:57,086
we are gonna add an element called the gallery.
21

21

00:00:57,929  -->  00:00:59,736
And then we have the three images.
22

22

00:00:59,736  -->  00:01:04,467
And I'm gonna wrap each of them in a figure element.
23

23

00:01:04,467  -->  00:01:07,217
Okay, so figure and gallery item.
24

24

00:01:11,286  -->  00:01:14,261
And then in there, we have the actual image
25

25

00:01:14,261  -->  00:01:16,011
called gallery photo.
26

26

00:01:18,435  -->  00:01:21,715
Now, the images that I want here I called
27

27

00:01:21,715  -->  00:01:24,715
I think just hotel, yeah, hotel one,
28

28

00:01:26,224  -->  00:01:30,278
and then here simply photo of hotel one.
29

29

00:01:30,278  -->  00:01:31,395
And that's it.
30

30

00:01:31,395  -->  00:01:33,017
So I'm actually wrapping these images here
31

31

00:01:33,017  -->  00:01:35,913
in a figure element so that you could later like add
32

32

00:01:35,913  -->  00:01:39,525
a fig caption element here, so to give these images
33

33

00:01:39,525  -->  00:01:42,808
a caption, but I'm not gonna do that right now.
34

34

00:01:42,808  -->  00:01:46,808
You could maybe do it later if you feel like it.
35

35

00:01:49,539  -->  00:01:50,622
So, hotel one
36

36

00:01:54,859  -->  00:01:57,636
becomes two, and then this one is just a number three.
37

37

00:01:57,636  -->  00:02:01,481
And then here the same in the description.
38

38

00:02:01,481  -->  00:02:03,931
And that's actually it.
39

39

00:02:03,931  -->  00:02:07,348
So, let's go to our components file here.
40

40

00:02:09,836  -->  00:02:11,086
And style this.
41

41

00:02:13,787  -->  00:02:16,037
Now just this comment here.
42

42

00:02:19,838  -->  00:02:22,103
And the first thing that we want to format
43

43

00:02:22,103  -->  00:02:23,936
is actually the photo.
44

44

00:02:26,694  -->  00:02:29,731
So, gallery photo, which is the image element.
45

45

00:02:29,731  -->  00:02:31,527
So, remember that in responsive design,
46

46

00:02:31,527  -->  00:02:33,359
we also want flexible images.
47

47

00:02:33,359  -->  00:02:35,514
And so, we always have to define a width
48

48

00:02:35,514  -->  00:02:39,379
or a height in percentages so that the image stays fluid.
49

49

00:02:39,379  -->  00:02:42,629
So let's set a width to 100% here.
50

50

00:02:44,569  -->  00:02:47,422
Okay, and then what we're gonna do to put the figure
51

51

00:02:47,422  -->  00:02:51,742
elements side by side is once again to use flexbox.
52

52

00:02:51,742  -->  00:02:56,574
Okay, so all we have to do is set the display to flex.
53

53

00:02:56,574  -->  00:02:59,686
And then all these figure elements should be side by side.
54

54

00:02:59,686  -->  00:03:02,369
And another thing here is that the image
55

55

00:03:02,369  -->  00:03:04,869
should be displayed as a blog.
56

56

00:03:05,710  -->  00:03:08,367
And that's about having a small space
57

57

00:03:08,367  -->  00:03:11,491
underneath an image, which happens when we leave it
58

58

00:03:11,491  -->  00:03:13,446
as an inline element.
59

59

00:03:13,446  -->  00:03:15,349
Okay, so an image should always be a block
60

60

00:03:15,349  -->  00:03:18,584
or an inline block if we don't want that wide space.
61

61

00:03:18,584  -->  00:03:20,781
So let's check that out, ask actually, first of all,
62

62

00:03:20,781  -->  00:03:24,954
we should get rid of this orange background.
63

63

00:03:24,954  -->  00:03:27,197
But you see that the images are actually already
64

64

00:03:27,197  -->  00:03:29,114
perfectly aligned here.
65

65

00:03:30,024  -->  00:03:34,901
So, first of all, let's get rid of that orange background.
66

66

00:03:34,901  -->  00:03:37,009
And where is it?
67

67

00:03:37,009  -->  00:03:37,842
Ah, here.
68

68

00:03:40,190  -->  00:03:42,853
Ah, that's much nicer.
69

69

00:03:42,853  -->  00:03:45,503
So let's just inspect these figures.
70

70

00:03:45,503  -->  00:03:47,988
And you see that because of flexbox,
71

71

00:03:47,988  -->  00:03:49,594
they are now side by side.
72

72

00:03:49,594  -->  00:03:54,420
So, if there was no flexbox here on the gallery,
73

73

00:03:54,420  -->  00:03:57,072
then this is what they would look like.
74

74

00:03:57,072  -->  00:04:00,506
So occupying 100% of the available width.
75

75

00:04:00,506  -->  00:04:03,375
Now, we could also set these items here
76

76

00:04:03,375  -->  00:04:07,542
or these images to 1/3, so like to 33.333%,
77

77

00:04:10,938  -->  00:04:13,375
and then use float on these figures here.
78

78

00:04:13,375  -->  00:04:14,932
So that would produce the same effect.
79

79

00:04:14,932  -->  00:04:16,877
And then we would have to use a clear fix
80

80

00:04:16,877  -->  00:04:19,849
on the parent, and all of that is a bunch of work.
81

81

00:04:19,849  -->  00:04:22,326
And so, once again, we just use flexbox
82

82

00:04:22,326  -->  00:04:24,825
in order to achieve the same result.
83

83

00:04:24,825  -->  00:04:26,818
So put these images side by side
84

84

00:04:26,818  -->  00:04:29,707
without any clear fix hack or anything like that.
85

85

00:04:29,707  -->  00:04:32,309
Okay, so that part is done, so let's now move on
86

86

00:04:32,309  -->  00:04:35,524
to the hotel overview itself.
87

87

00:04:35,524  -->  00:04:37,233
So there are four parts in here.
88

88

00:04:37,233  -->  00:04:39,275
First we have this heading, so this will be her
89

89

00:04:39,275  -->  00:04:42,539
H one element, meaning that it's like
90

90

00:04:42,539  -->  00:04:44,566
the main title of this document.
91

91

00:04:44,566  -->  00:04:47,095
Then we have the stars here.
92

92

00:04:47,095  -->  00:04:49,120
Then after that the location on this side.
93

93

00:04:49,120  -->  00:04:52,128
And then the overall user rating.
94

94

00:04:52,128  -->  00:04:54,795
So let's mark it up in our HTML.
95

95

00:04:57,245  -->  00:05:01,245
And so, this one I'm gonna call it the overview.
96

96

00:05:03,116  -->  00:05:07,649
Okay, and then our H one that I was talking about,
97

97

00:05:07,649  -->  00:05:09,316
so overview heading,
98

98

00:05:12,314  -->  00:05:16,891
and this hotel is simply called Hotel Las Palmas.
99

99

00:05:16,891  -->  00:05:19,262
Maybe not the most creative name.
100

100

00:05:19,262  -->  00:05:20,987
But it serves our purpose here.
101

101

00:05:20,987  -->  00:05:23,205
Okay, so the next one is the stars.
102

102

00:05:23,205  -->  00:05:26,058
And so, I'm simply gonna put them in a container first,
103

103

00:05:26,058  -->  00:05:27,558
so overview stars.
104

104

00:05:31,143  -->  00:05:33,550
And then in there we put our five stars.
105

105

00:05:33,550  -->  00:05:36,408
So one SVG icon for each of them.
106

106

00:05:36,408  -->  00:05:40,661
Such as we did before with all the other icons.
107

107

00:05:40,661  -->  00:05:42,093
So let me actually copy that part
108

108

00:05:42,093  -->  00:05:46,176
instead of having to write it out all over again.
109

109

00:05:47,679  -->  00:05:49,532
And this one, let's see how it's called.
110

110

00:05:49,532  -->  00:05:53,699
It's probably just star, and, yeah, you see it is.
111

111

00:05:55,789  -->  00:05:59,956
So icon star, and now we just need this five times.
112

112

00:06:01,730  -->  00:06:04,147
And so, these are our five stars.
113

113

00:06:04,147  -->  00:06:06,980
So, next up, we have our location.
114

114

00:06:08,437  -->  00:06:09,437
So, overview
115

115

00:06:13,444  -->  00:06:14,277
location.
116

116

00:06:18,386  -->  00:06:20,843
Now, let's just take a quick look at that
117

117

00:06:20,843  -->  00:06:22,416
in a finished example.
118

118

00:06:22,416  -->  00:06:24,825
So you see that here we have this location icon
119

119

00:06:24,825  -->  00:06:26,732
and then this underlying text.
120

120

00:06:26,732  -->  00:06:29,548
And this here is actually what I call an inline button
121

121

00:06:29,548  -->  00:06:31,857
because down here we have it again.
122

122

00:06:31,857  -->  00:06:34,575
So it's this button here
123

123

00:06:34,575  -->  00:06:36,356
that we use up here in the location.
124

124

00:06:36,356  -->  00:06:39,424
And then down here for this show all button here again.
125

125

00:06:39,424  -->  00:06:41,762
And it actually has this nice effect that I
126

126

00:06:41,762  -->  00:06:44,382
was telling you about, so this infinite animation,
127

127

00:06:44,382  -->  00:06:45,788
which is this one.
128

128

00:06:45,788  -->  00:06:47,195
So when the button is focused,
129

129

00:06:47,195  -->  00:06:49,415
it will have this permanent and infinite
130

130

00:06:49,415  -->  00:06:51,689
pulsating animation here.
131

131

00:06:51,689  -->  00:06:54,456
But we're gonna leave that one for later.
132

132

00:06:54,456  -->  00:06:55,602
So for now I just wanted to tell you
133

133

00:06:55,602  -->  00:06:59,263
that we have this icon and this button here.
134

134

00:06:59,263  -->  00:07:02,842
And then in the next one, we have this rating element here
135

135

00:07:02,842  -->  00:07:06,725
and then this text, and then the number of votes down there.
136

136

00:07:06,725  -->  00:07:09,333
Okay, so we start with the icon here.
137

137

00:07:09,333  -->  00:07:12,515
Once again, I'm gonna get that from here.
138

138

00:07:12,515  -->  00:07:15,348
And it is called the location pin.
139

139

00:07:20,205  -->  00:07:24,179
So, location pin, and then down here the button
140

140

00:07:24,179  -->  00:07:25,929
called button inline.
141

141

00:07:28,057  -->  00:07:32,118
And the location of this innocent Albufeira.
142

142

00:07:32,118  -->  00:07:36,086
So, in the sunny southern part of beautiful Portugal.
143

143

00:07:36,086  -->  00:07:40,253
Okay, so that is the location and of finally the rating.
144

144

00:07:46,237  -->  00:07:48,320
Then we have the average,
145

145

00:07:51,515  -->  00:07:53,765
which was in our case, 8.6.
146

146

00:07:56,471  -->  00:07:58,971
And the overview rating count.
147

147

00:08:03,404  -->  00:08:04,571
So, 429 votes.
148

148

00:08:06,621  -->  00:08:09,988
And I'm putting votes because it's shorter than ratings.
149

149

00:08:09,988  -->  00:08:12,262
So that's the only reason.
150

150

00:08:12,262  -->  00:08:15,400
All right, so now we're ready to take a look at it.
151

151

00:08:15,400  -->  00:08:17,171
And that already looks pretty nice.
152

152

00:08:17,171  -->  00:08:18,955
Now, this is already formatted here
153

153

00:08:18,955  -->  00:08:21,210
with this gray color.
154

154

00:08:21,210  -->  00:08:24,229
And that's probably because when I copied it,
155

155

00:08:24,229  -->  00:08:26,380
it came with this wrong class name here.
156

156

00:08:26,380  -->  00:08:29,380
So that's of course not what I want.
157

157

00:08:30,693  -->  00:08:32,828
And actually down here as well,
158

158

00:08:32,828  -->  00:08:35,995
so what I want here is really overview
159

159

00:08:39,362  -->  00:08:42,945
icon star, and down here actually location.
160

160

00:08:45,340  -->  00:08:48,161
So these ones here for the icon stars,
161

161

00:08:48,161  -->  00:08:51,075
and this here is the icon location.
162

162

00:08:51,075  -->  00:08:53,609
And so, now they look huge of course
163

163

00:08:53,609  -->  00:08:56,785
because they are still completely unformatted.
164

164

00:08:56,785  -->  00:08:59,355
So, in order to be able to work with this,
165

165

00:08:59,355  -->  00:09:03,522
let's actually start by formatting these icons here.
166

166

00:09:05,263  -->  00:09:07,346
So, a new component here.
167

167

00:09:13,000  -->  00:09:16,000
And let me copy this one here again.
168

168

00:09:20,155  -->  00:09:22,655
So, writing all our selectors,
169

169

00:09:24,025  -->  00:09:26,192
we start with the heading,
170

170

00:09:27,756  -->  00:09:29,673
then we have the stars,
171

171

00:09:32,285  -->  00:09:34,535
and we have the icon stars.
172

172

00:09:39,088  -->  00:09:41,755
And let's see what else we have.
173

173

00:09:43,959  -->  00:09:47,515
So, we have location, icon location, rating,
174

174

00:09:47,515  -->  00:09:50,265
rating average, and rating count.
175

175

00:09:59,440  -->  00:10:01,870
Then we have the icon location, and we can probably group
176

176

00:10:01,870  -->  00:10:04,620
that together with the icon star.
177

177

00:10:09,913  -->  00:10:12,080
So, icon location in here.
178

178

00:10:14,913  -->  00:10:16,913
Then we have the rating.
179

179

00:10:20,555  -->  00:10:24,555
And finally the rating count and rating average.
180

180

00:10:33,072  -->  00:10:35,654
All right, so once again, a lot of selectors here,
181

181

00:10:35,654  -->  00:10:38,061
but that's just how it works when you're coding up
182

182

00:10:38,061  -->  00:10:41,267
such a big and detailed interface.
183

183

00:10:41,267  -->  00:10:43,767
So, let's give it here a width
184

184

00:10:45,567  -->  00:10:48,858
of 1.75 rem, and of course the same height
185

185

00:10:48,858  -->  00:10:51,343
such as we've been doing all the time.
186

186

00:10:51,343  -->  00:10:53,010
So 1.75 rem as well.
187

187

00:10:54,271  -->  00:10:58,444
And then the color, so we use fill again.
188

188

00:10:58,444  -->  00:11:01,784
Setting it to the primary color.
189

189

00:11:01,784  -->  00:11:03,284
So, color primary.
190

190

00:11:05,877  -->  00:11:08,118
So let's take a look.
191

191

00:11:08,118  -->  00:11:10,046
And so, that looks much better.
192

192

00:11:10,046  -->  00:11:12,650
Next step is to pit all of these four boxes
193

193

00:11:12,650  -->  00:11:16,817
side by side, and so, that's really easy, nothing new here.
194

194

00:11:18,221  -->  00:11:20,554
So we use flexbox of course.
195

195

00:11:21,902  -->  00:11:23,395
And flexbox will do its magic.
196

196

00:11:23,395  -->  00:11:25,451
And so, now it looks like this.
197

197

00:11:25,451  -->  00:11:27,410
All of these side by side.
198

198

00:11:27,410  -->  00:11:29,713
Now this is of course still not perfect.
199

199

00:11:29,713  -->  00:11:31,645
So let's fix that as well.
200

200

00:11:31,645  -->  00:11:33,348
And the first way I want to do it
201

201

00:11:33,348  -->  00:11:35,861
is to of course use justify content.
202

202

00:11:35,861  -->  00:11:38,444
So let's use space between here
203

203

00:11:39,740  -->  00:11:42,105
so that it will evenly distribute all the space
204

204

00:11:42,105  -->  00:11:46,226
between all the elements along the main axis.
205

205

00:11:46,226  -->  00:11:48,587
And so, that is the result that we get.
206

206

00:11:48,587  -->  00:11:51,226
Now, the thing is that this is not quite what we have
207

207

00:11:51,226  -->  00:11:52,893
in our demo example.
208

208

00:11:54,603  -->  00:11:58,022
So, this one here, this is not quite what we have.
209

209

00:11:58,022  -->  00:12:01,466
So we have the stars actually close to the heading.
210

210

00:12:01,466  -->  00:12:03,620
And then the location close to the rating.
211

211

00:12:03,620  -->  00:12:06,785
And then a huge space in the middle of these two.
212

212

00:12:06,785  -->  00:12:09,209
And so, therefore, justify content is not a good way
213

213

00:12:09,209  -->  00:12:11,396
of doing that, because it doesn't allow us to create
214

214

00:12:11,396  -->  00:12:15,538
a space only between two of the four elements.
215

215

00:12:15,538  -->  00:12:17,705
And so, let's remove that.
216

216

00:12:18,584  -->  00:12:20,317
So I just wanted to show it to you
217

217

00:12:20,317  -->  00:12:21,851
why it doesn't work.
218

218

00:12:21,851  -->  00:12:24,523
And so, the next thing we can try is to use flex
219

219

00:12:24,523  -->  00:12:26,478
on, for example, the location.
220

220

00:12:26,478  -->  00:12:28,877
So what I want is this.
221

221

00:12:28,877  -->  00:12:32,557
We can say flex to one, and what this is is that
222

222

00:12:32,557  -->  00:12:35,040
this flex item should grow and occupy
223

223

00:12:35,040  -->  00:12:37,432
all the available space.
224

224

00:12:37,432  -->  00:12:41,583
And this will actually be pretty close to what we want.
225

225

00:12:41,583  -->  00:12:43,398
So let me show that to you.
226

226

00:12:43,398  -->  00:12:46,325
So, yeah, now it occupied all of this entire space here.
227

227

00:12:46,325  -->  00:12:48,427
And actually we probably would want that
228

228

00:12:48,427  -->  00:12:49,510
on the stars.
229

229

00:12:52,919  -->  00:12:55,864
So, that's how it would look like.
230

230

00:12:55,864  -->  00:12:59,090
And that is exactly what we want here in this demo.
231

231

00:12:59,090  -->  00:13:03,136
Now, in order to show you that this isn't really ideal.
232

232

00:13:03,136  -->  00:13:06,136
Let me give this a background color.
233

233

00:13:09,870  -->  00:13:12,395
And so, you will see that now this element here
234

234

00:13:12,395  -->  00:13:15,217
is occupying this entire space,
235

235

00:13:15,217  -->  00:13:16,657
just as we told it to do.
236

236

00:13:16,657  -->  00:13:19,482
So we told it to expand, to grow and occupy
237

237

00:13:19,482  -->  00:13:21,149
all the space that is available.
238

238

00:13:21,149  -->  00:13:22,267
And that's what it did.
239

239

00:13:22,267  -->  00:13:24,794
Now, this is not ideal, because this element should only
240

240

00:13:24,794  -->  00:13:27,542
be the size of its content,
241

241

00:13:27,542  -->  00:13:30,650
so in this case the size of these stars.
242

242

00:13:30,650  -->  00:13:33,139
We don't want it to have all of this size.
243

243

00:13:33,139  -->  00:13:35,421
Imagine that we would have a hover effect on this
244

244

00:13:35,421  -->  00:13:38,228
and then all of this entire element here
245

245

00:13:38,228  -->  00:13:40,619
would be hovered and would change the background,
246

246

00:13:40,619  -->  00:13:42,460
for example, and that's not what we want.
247

247

00:13:42,460  -->  00:13:44,992
We only want the hypothetical hover effect
248

248

00:13:44,992  -->  00:13:46,808
to occur right here on this box
249

249

00:13:46,808  -->  00:13:48,957
where the stars actually are.
250

250

00:13:48,957  -->  00:13:52,906
So what we want is a way to create this space here
251

251

00:13:52,906  -->  00:13:56,465
without actually stretching out this entire element.
252

252

00:13:56,465  -->  00:14:00,608
And that is where the power of margin auto comes in.
253

253

00:14:00,608  -->  00:14:02,513
So let me show that to you.
254

254

00:14:02,513  -->  00:14:07,119
So we remove flex one, and instead we can use margin right
255

255

00:14:07,119  -->  00:14:09,257
and set it to auto.
256

256

00:14:09,257  -->  00:14:12,564
And that's a very powerful trick in flexbox.
257

257

00:14:12,564  -->  00:14:14,149
And that's what happens.
258

258

00:14:14,149  -->  00:14:17,186
So, the same result, but with our element actually
259

259

00:14:17,186  -->  00:14:20,204
only occupying the space that it needs here.
260

260

00:14:20,204  -->  00:14:21,790
So this is the space that it needs.
261

261

00:14:21,790  -->  00:14:23,656
And so, that's all that's occupied.
262

262

00:14:23,656  -->  00:14:25,489
And then all of this space is
263

263

00:14:25,489  -->  00:14:27,573
the automatically calculated margin.
264

264

00:14:27,573  -->  00:14:29,101
So this is a great trick.
265

265

00:14:29,101  -->  00:14:30,948
You should probably write it down because it's really
266

266

00:14:30,948  -->  00:14:34,210
helpful in flexbox to use margin auto.
267

267

00:14:34,210  -->  00:14:35,873
Each time we have a situation like this,
268

268

00:14:35,873  -->  00:14:37,862
we want to create some space like this,
269

269

00:14:37,862  -->  00:14:39,608
we can use margin auto.
270

270

00:14:39,608  -->  00:14:42,010
We could also have used margin left auto
271

271

00:14:42,010  -->  00:14:44,076
on this element here that would have created
272

272

00:14:44,076  -->  00:14:44,909
the exact same space.
273

273

00:14:44,909  -->  00:14:48,333
And so, again, this is a very good trick to know
274

274

00:14:48,333  -->  00:14:50,447
and to use with flexbox.
275

275

00:14:50,447  -->  00:14:54,216
Okay, so let's just get rid of that background.
276

276

00:14:54,216  -->  00:14:55,633
Color, of course.
277

277

00:14:58,275  -->  00:15:00,830
And so, in terms of layout, we're getting pretty close
278

278

00:15:00,830  -->  00:15:02,446
to the original version.
279

279

00:15:02,446  -->  00:15:04,116
All we have to do now is to actually format
280

280

00:15:04,116  -->  00:15:07,507
each of these four smaller components here.
281

281

00:15:07,507  -->  00:15:09,540
But I'm gonna leave that to the next video
282

282

00:15:09,540  -->  00:15:12,111
so that you can take a quick break.
283

283

00:15:12,111  -->  00:15:14,111
So see you in a second.
