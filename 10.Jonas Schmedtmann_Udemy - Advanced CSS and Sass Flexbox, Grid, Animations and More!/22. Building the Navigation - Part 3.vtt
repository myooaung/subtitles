00:00:01.530  -->  00:00:04.909
<v ->In the third and final part of building the navigation,</v>
2

2

00:00:04.909  -->  00:00:07.597
we're going to code up that nice button that
3

3

00:00:07.597  -->  00:00:10.261
is still missing from our navigation.
4

4

00:00:10.261  -->  00:00:13.052
This is what it looks like.
5

5

00:00:13.052  -->  00:00:16.541
This is basically composed of these three lines.
6

6

00:00:16.541  -->  00:00:19.501
This line here in the middle, it will be simply a small
7

7

00:00:19.501  -->  00:00:20.909
span element.
8

8

00:00:20.909  -->  00:00:21.775
Okay.
9

9

00:00:21.775  -->  00:00:24.412
This one here will be a before, pseudo element.
10

10

00:00:24.412  -->  00:00:28.005
This one will be an after, pseudo element.
11

11

00:00:28.005  -->  00:00:31.669
Instead of putting three of the same elements in the
12

12

00:00:31.669  -->  00:00:33.109
HTML, we just put one and then we use
13

13

00:00:33.109  -->  00:00:34.821
pseudo-classes to make the rest.
14

14

00:00:34.821  -->  00:00:35.654
Okay.
15

15

00:00:35.654  -->  00:00:39.098
Then, when we click, well, you see that the one
16

16

00:00:39.098  -->  00:00:40.634
in the middle disappears, and the other one rotates
17

17

00:00:40.634  -->  00:00:43.961
in order for it to form this cross.
18

18

00:00:43.961  -->  00:00:45.603
And that's it.
19

19

00:00:45.603  -->  00:00:47.385
Well, it looks easier than it is, but we can still
20

20

00:00:47.385  -->  00:00:48.634
do it, of course.
21

21

00:00:48.634  -->  00:00:51.730
Making the HTML, this is where it will be.
22

22

00:00:51.730  -->  00:00:52.586
Okay.
23

23

00:00:52.586  -->  00:00:56.753
We're going to have a span called, "Navigation Icon".
24

24

00:01:01.013  -->  00:01:02.033
And it will be empty.
25

25

00:01:02.033  -->  00:01:05.450
Let's just post this, "nbsp," here again.
26

26

00:01:06.807  -->  00:01:08.140
Navigation icon.
27

27

00:01:09.984  -->  00:01:12.401
Let's add some color to here.
28

28

00:01:14.420  -->  00:01:15.900
Icon.
29

29

00:01:15.900  -->  00:01:18.733
Then, let's set the functionality.
30

30

00:01:24.175  -->  00:01:27.342
Let's put that in the icon, down here.
31

31

00:01:28.976  -->  00:01:29.809
All right.
32

32

00:01:29.809  -->  00:01:31.567
As I was saying, we are going to create
33

33

00:01:31.567  -->  00:01:34.135
a before and an after pseudo element.
34

34

00:01:34.135  -->  00:01:37.247
There are some styles that all of the three will share.
35

35

00:01:37.247  -->  00:01:39.659
Let's start with these for now.
36

36

00:01:39.659  -->  00:01:43.826
The icon element itself, then the before pseudo element,
37

37

00:01:46.746  -->  00:01:49.770
and the after pseudo element, as well.
38

38

00:01:49.770  -->  00:01:53.937
These three will have a width of 3 rem, and a height
39

39

00:01:59.119  -->  00:02:01.014
of only two pixels.
40

40

00:02:01.014  -->  00:02:02.182
Okay?
41

41

00:02:02.182  -->  00:02:05.311
Here we use pixels because we don't want this to change.
42

42

00:02:05.311  -->  00:02:07.720
It will always be two pixels no matter what the
43

43

00:02:07.720  -->  00:02:09.342
base size should be.
44

44

00:02:09.342  -->  00:02:10.775
The very simple background color will be some nice,
45

45

00:02:10.775  -->  00:02:13.198
dark - so let's get that actually.
46

46

00:02:13.198  -->  00:02:17.365
The darkest one that we have, and that is this one, here.
47

47

00:02:19.811  -->  00:02:20.747
Okay.
48

48

00:02:20.747  -->  00:02:23.487
Remember that in order for the before and after
49

49

00:02:23.487  -->  00:02:25.319
pseudo elements to actually appear on the page,
50

50

00:02:25.319  -->  00:02:29.402
they need to have their content property defined.
51

51

00:02:30.699  -->  00:02:32.427
Let's do that.
52

52

00:02:32.427  -->  00:02:36.227
Content, and once again it will be empty.
53

53

00:02:36.227  -->  00:02:39.331
Now, they also need to have their display property set.
54

54

00:02:39.331  -->  00:02:42.147
We can do that in here because we want all of them
55

55

00:02:42.147  -->  00:02:46.811
to be in line blocks, for obvious reasons, right?
56

56

00:02:46.811  -->  00:02:48.315
All right.
57

57

00:02:48.315  -->  00:02:49.595
Let's just take a look.
58

58

00:02:49.595  -->  00:02:52.227
It will not look really good for now.
59

59

00:02:52.227  -->  00:02:53.977
It's kind of a start.
60

60

00:02:55.379  -->  00:02:56.475
Okay?
61

61

00:02:56.475  -->  00:02:57.725
Let's continue.
62

62

00:02:58.979  -->  00:03:02.517
Well, maybe, actually, let's see which one is which.
63

63

00:03:02.517  -->  00:03:06.684
If we inspect this one, then this one here is the span.
64

64

00:03:07.870  -->  00:03:10.445
Okay, the first one is the span and the other two are
65

65

00:03:10.445  -->  00:03:12.654
the after and the before pseudo elements.
66

66

00:03:12.654  -->  00:03:15.101
I'm not really sure why they are located where they are,
67

67

00:03:15.101  -->  00:03:17.813
but that doesn't really matter.
68

68

00:03:17.813  -->  00:03:18.701
Okay?
69

69

00:03:18.701  -->  00:03:22.165
How are we going to position these?
70

70

00:03:22.165  -->  00:03:25.617
I suggest we just use absolute positioning.
71

71

00:03:25.617  -->  00:03:29.450
Position absolute, and then on the parent one,
72

72

00:03:32.717  -->  00:03:34.421
well, it's actually not here.
73

73

00:03:34.421  -->  00:03:36.373
The parent one is just the icon.
74

74

00:03:36.373  -->  00:03:38.686
That's the parent element.
75

75

00:03:38.686  -->  00:03:41.341
We need to specify the position here as well.
76

76

00:03:41.341  -->  00:03:43.798
This one is relative.
77

77

00:03:43.798  -->  00:03:48.284
The before and the after, they are then positioned
78

78

00:03:48.284  -->  00:03:51.972
in relation to the span element, so to the icon
79

79

00:03:51.972  -->  00:03:53.515
element, itself.
80

80

00:03:53.515  -->  00:03:55.627
Now, they should be zero from the left, and then
81

81

00:03:55.627  -->  00:03:59.572
we want one at the top and one at the bottom.
82

82

00:03:59.572  -->  00:04:01.427
Okay, let's do that.
83

83

00:04:01.427  -->  00:04:02.844
So, one for each.
84

84

00:04:04.875  -->  00:04:09.042
Before that's to say top minus one ram, so to move it up,
85

85

00:04:10.733  -->  00:04:11.566
basically.
86

86

00:04:13.053  -->  00:04:17.220
Then the other one, the after, top one rem, so to just
87

87

00:04:20.469  -->  00:04:21.552
move it down.
88

88

00:04:22.629  -->  00:04:24.351
Let's take a look now.
89

89

00:04:24.351  -->  00:04:25.381
All right.
90

90

00:04:25.381  -->  00:04:27.517
That looks a lot better already.
91

91

00:04:27.517  -->  00:04:29.437
We see that the one in the middle is the span element.
92

92

00:04:29.437  -->  00:04:32.117
Now, if you want now center this horizontally, then
93

93

00:04:32.117  -->  00:04:35.253
we can simply set the text align property here to center
94

94

00:04:35.253  -->  00:04:38.142
on the navigation button.
95

95

00:04:38.142  -->  00:04:38.975
All right.
96

96

00:04:38.975  -->  00:04:40.475
Let's do that one.
97

97

00:04:41.901  -->  00:04:43.484
Text align, center.
98

98

00:04:47.432  -->  00:04:50.848
Then all we have to do is just move down all of this
99

99

00:04:50.848  -->  00:04:51.931
a little bit.
100

100

00:04:52.930  -->  00:04:57.097
We just have to give it a margin top here of three rem,
101

101

00:04:59.406  -->  00:05:00.239
let's say.
102

102

00:05:02.550  -->  00:05:04.326
That looks pretty good already.
103

103

00:05:04.326  -->  00:05:06.576
Maybe three point five rem.
104

104

00:05:10.261  -->  00:05:11.829
That's excellent already.
105

105

00:05:11.829  -->  00:05:13.709
It's really nice and assembled.
106

106

00:05:13.709  -->  00:05:15.573
It looks like this already.
107

107

00:05:15.573  -->  00:05:17.389
While this one here is a bit closer,
108

108

00:05:17.389  -->  00:05:19.261
so the lines are closer.
109

109

00:05:19.261  -->  00:05:21.094
Let's do that as well.
110

110

00:05:22.870  -->  00:05:26.221
Minus point eight, and point eight here as well.
111

111

00:05:26.221  -->  00:05:27.389
Just eight pixels.
112

112

00:05:27.389  -->  00:05:30.445
One or two pixels can make a huge difference sometimes,
113

113

00:05:30.445  -->  00:05:32.445
as we just saw.
114

114

00:05:32.445  -->  00:05:33.278
All right.
115

115

00:05:33.278  -->  00:05:34.581
That's for the styling.
116

116

00:05:34.581  -->  00:05:39.173
Now, we want, first of all, this to happen when we hover it.
117

117

00:05:39.173  -->  00:05:40.578
These move a bit up.
118

118

00:05:40.578  -->  00:05:43.474
Actually, also this hand cursor, here, right?
119

119

00:05:43.474  -->  00:05:47.122
The pointer is not happening right here,
120

120

00:05:47.122  -->  00:05:49.619
for obvious reasons.
121

121

00:05:49.619  -->  00:05:51.739
Let's do that as well.
122

122

00:05:51.739  -->  00:05:53.530
That is here.
123

123

00:05:53.530  -->  00:05:54.863
Cursor, pointer.
124

124

00:05:57.103  -->  00:05:58.242
All right.
125

125

00:05:58.242  -->  00:05:59.991
That will fix that one.
126

126

00:05:59.991  -->  00:06:03.319
Now we want, as soon as we hover the button, these
127

127

00:06:03.319  -->  00:06:05.782
lines to space out a little bit.
128

128

00:06:05.782  -->  00:06:07.439
How do we do that?
129

129

00:06:07.439  -->  00:06:09.678
It's not difficult.
130

130

00:06:09.678  -->  00:06:13.878
I'd simply select the button, of course, because
131

131

00:06:13.878  -->  00:06:15.974
that's where we want to hover.
132

132

00:06:15.974  -->  00:06:17.141
Button, hover.
133

133

00:06:20.112  -->  00:06:23.529
Then, from there, we can select the icon.
134

134

00:06:25.176  -->  00:06:29.221
We actually want the pseudo element, before.
135

135

00:06:29.221  -->  00:06:31.340
We can do it this way because the icon is
136

136

00:06:31.340  -->  00:06:33.840
a child element of the button.
137

137

00:06:34.881  -->  00:06:36.745
The button and the icon.
138

138

00:06:36.745  -->  00:06:38.433
That's a childe element.
139

139

00:06:38.433  -->  00:06:39.738
We can just select it like this.
140

140

00:06:39.738  -->  00:06:40.571
Very easy.
141

141

00:06:42.434  -->  00:06:45.010
What we want to animate here is actually the top property.
142

142

00:06:45.010  -->  00:06:46.474
All right.
143

143

00:06:46.474  -->  00:06:48.162
So that was minus point eight, here.
144

144

00:06:48.162  -->  00:06:50.745
Let's put it as minus one, now.
145

145

00:06:52.186  -->  00:06:54.963
And then the same thing actually for the after.
146

146

00:06:54.963  -->  00:06:56.296
After, now, one.
147

147

00:06:59.970  -->  00:07:03.169
Then, of course, we need to transition all of this.
148

148

00:07:03.169  -->  00:07:06.336
Transition, all, in point two seconds.
149

149

00:07:07.294  -->  00:07:08.310
All right.
150

150

00:07:08.310  -->  00:07:10.919
Now, I could have done all of this here with translate,
151

151

00:07:10.919  -->  00:07:13.526
maybe, instead of top and absolute positioning, but
152

152

00:07:13.526  -->  00:07:14.695
it's all right.
153

153

00:07:14.695  -->  00:07:16.118
It's absolutely no problem, as long as it works.
154

154

00:07:16.118  -->  00:07:18.830
Different tools will do the same job.
155

155

00:07:18.830  -->  00:07:20.094
Okay?
156

156

00:07:20.094  -->  00:07:22.470
Let's close this one here.
157

157

00:07:22.470  -->  00:07:24.387
That looks really nice.
158

158

00:07:26.663  -->  00:07:30.069
That's our functionality already.
159

159

00:07:30.069  -->  00:07:33.893
All that's left to do is to now basically rotate these
160

160

00:07:33.893  -->  00:07:37.013
two here to form a cross and make the one
161

161

00:07:37.013  -->  00:07:39.005
in the middle disappear.
162

162

00:07:39.005  -->  00:07:43.286
Let's start actually with that, making one disappear.
163

163

00:07:43.286  -->  00:07:46.382
That shouldn't be so difficult, as well, right?
164

164

00:07:46.382  -->  00:07:49.204
Now, when does this actually happen?
165

165

00:07:49.204  -->  00:07:51.730
Well, this is back to the checkbox, right?
166

166

00:07:51.730  -->  00:07:55.313
When the checkbox is checked, then, we want
167

167

00:08:00.185  -->  00:08:02.258
something to happen.
168

168

00:08:02.258  -->  00:08:04.425
What do we want to happen?
169

169

00:08:05.777  -->  00:08:09.131
We want to select here this button.
170

170

00:08:09.131  -->  00:08:11.228
This button is a sibling.
171

171

00:08:11.228  -->  00:08:12.867
It's actually an adjacent sibling.
172

172

00:08:12.867  -->  00:08:15.034
We can use the plus, here.
173

173

00:08:16.227  -->  00:08:18.277
Before we have to fix that.
174

174

00:08:18.277  -->  00:08:21.944
We can use the plus because it is an adjacent sibling.
175

175

00:08:21.944  -->  00:08:23.027
Then, button.
176

176

00:08:24.583  -->  00:08:26.816
Then from there we can select the chart element again,
177

177

00:08:26.816  -->  00:08:28.733
such as we did up here.
178

178

00:08:29.847  -->  00:08:31.680
The icon in this case.
179

179

00:08:33.128  -->  00:08:34.211
You got that?
180

180

00:08:35.288  -->  00:08:37.487
When the checkbox is selected, then we select its
181

181

00:08:37.487  -->  00:08:39.822
brother, basically, which is called a button.
182

182

00:08:39.822  -->  00:08:43.220
Then, we select the button's child, which is the icon.
183

183

00:08:43.220  -->  00:08:44.204
All right?
184

184

00:08:44.204  -->  00:08:47.755
Again, the same logic with the checkbox hack that I
185

185

00:08:47.755  -->  00:08:48.803
explained to you before.
186

186

00:08:48.803  -->  00:08:50.356
Okay, this one we want to disappear.
187

187

00:08:50.356  -->  00:08:53.220
Now, we don't want to really change its size.
188

188

00:08:53.220  -->  00:08:54.347
Okay?
189

189

00:08:54.347  -->  00:08:56.852
This element has a size, but the after and the before
190

190

00:08:56.852  -->  00:09:00.547
pseudo elements, they depend on this size, right?
191

191

00:09:00.547  -->  00:09:03.292
They're positioned in relation to that size.
192

192

00:09:03.292  -->  00:09:05.011
If we now remove that size -
193

193

00:09:05.011  -->  00:09:07.908
If we would remove the width and the height of this element,
194

194

00:09:07.908  -->  00:09:10.523
then it would change the positions of the before and after.
195

195

00:09:10.523  -->  00:09:11.651
We don't want that.
196

196

00:09:11.651  -->  00:09:13.283
We will keep it very simple.
197

197

00:09:13.283  -->  00:09:14.979
All we do here is to change
198

198

00:09:14.979  -->  00:09:17.979
the background color to transparent.
199

199

00:09:21.640  -->  00:09:23.752
You see, we've been using transparent a lot of time,
200

200

00:09:23.752  -->  00:09:26.945
and that's because, well, sometimes that is very handy
201

201

00:09:26.945  -->  00:09:29.704
just to make an element invisible like that.
202

202

00:09:29.704  -->  00:09:30.672
Okay.
203

203

00:09:30.672  -->  00:09:32.496
That is the first step.
204

204

00:09:32.496  -->  00:09:34.246
We're getting closer.
205

205

00:09:37.318  -->  00:09:42.110
Next up, we do the same thing here with the after and
206

206

00:09:42.110  -->  00:09:43.027
the before.
207

207

00:09:45.813  -->  00:09:48.563
Before, well not this, of course.
208

208

00:09:54.275  -->  00:09:55.969
And the after.
209

209

00:09:55.969  -->  00:09:58.185
What do we with these, actually?
210

210

00:09:58.185  -->  00:10:01.999
Well, as we said, we are going to rotate them.
211

211

00:10:01.999  -->  00:10:03.607
Transform.
212

212

00:10:03.607  -->  00:10:04.713
Rotate.
213

213

00:10:04.713  -->  00:10:07.775
Basically, it looks like they are 45 degrees rotated.
214

214

00:10:07.775  -->  00:10:08.608
Right?
215

215

00:10:09.935  -->  00:10:11.927
Let's rotate one.
216

216

00:10:11.927  -->  00:10:14.439
45 degrees in one direction, and the other one in
217

217

00:10:14.439  -->  00:10:16.415
the opposite direction.
218

218

00:10:16.415  -->  00:10:19.727
If they rotate in opposite directions, they should
219

219

00:10:19.727  -->  00:10:21.227
create this cross.
220

220

00:10:22.415  -->  00:10:24.582
Let's take a look at that.
221

221

00:10:27.207  -->  00:10:29.645
Well, kind of, okay? (chuckling)
222

222

00:10:29.645  -->  00:10:34.447
Not really there yet, but it's starting to work.
223

223

00:10:34.447  -->  00:10:35.424
Why is it not working?
224

224

00:10:35.424  -->  00:10:37.343
That's because of two factors.
225

225

00:10:37.343  -->  00:10:39.599
First up, we should move them to the middle.
226

226

00:10:39.599  -->  00:10:40.432
Okay?
227

227

00:10:40.432  -->  00:10:42.471
Now, they're still spaced out in relation to the
228

228

00:10:42.471  -->  00:10:44.191
one in the middle.
229

229

00:10:44.191  -->  00:10:46.941
We should move them back to zero.
230

230

00:10:47.792  -->  00:10:48.959
A top of zero.
231

231

00:10:51.861  -->  00:10:54.194
The same for this one, here.
232

232

00:10:55.327  -->  00:10:59.622
This is actually a lot of experimentation and stuff.
233

233

00:10:59.622  -->  00:11:04.084
I really had to experiment around in order to make it work.
234

234

00:11:04.084  -->  00:11:05.772
Don't think you have to be actually
235

235

00:11:05.772  -->  00:11:07.668
able to code up all of this really
236

236

00:11:07.668  -->  00:11:09.773
quickly like I'm doing here, because
237

237

00:11:09.773  -->  00:11:11.117
that's not the reality.
238

238

00:11:11.117  -->  00:11:13.356
Usually, we have to try out some things.
239

239

00:11:13.356  -->  00:11:14.844
Try your different tools.
240

240

00:11:14.844  -->  00:11:16.596
Thats's excatly why we have these tools, so that we
241

241

00:11:16.596  -->  00:11:17.500
can use them.
242

242

00:11:17.500  -->  00:11:20.732
So that we can test them and find a final solution.
243

243

00:11:20.732  -->  00:11:22.050
That's what I did here.
244

244

00:11:22.050  -->  00:11:24.068
That's the one that I'm showing you.
245

245

00:11:24.068  -->  00:11:24.901
All right.
246

246

00:11:26.748  -->  00:11:28.372
It already looks pretty good.
247

247

00:11:28.372  -->  00:11:29.468
Right?
248

248

00:11:29.468  -->  00:11:31.613
Now, I want to make this a little bit better.
249

249

00:11:31.613  -->  00:11:33.013
Now you see, now they are basically
250

250

00:11:33.013  -->  00:11:35.045
just moving down like that.
251

251

00:11:35.045  -->  00:11:35.932
See that?
252

252

00:11:35.932  -->  00:11:36.908
Again.
253

253

00:11:36.908  -->  00:11:39.164
Here, it looks a bit cooler.
254

254

00:11:39.164  -->  00:11:40.997
It rotated a bit more.
255

255

00:11:43.141  -->  00:11:44.773
Let's do that.
256

256

00:11:44.773  -->  00:11:48.485
What we're going to do here is rotate them 180 degrees,
257

257

00:11:48.485  -->  00:11:49.318
minus 45.
258

258

00:11:50.589  -->  00:11:51.422
Okay?
259

259

00:11:51.422  -->  00:11:54.439
180 degrees is half a rotation, and if we subract 45
260

260

00:11:54.439  -->  00:11:57.702
from that, we end up basically with not a quarter of
261

261

00:11:57.702  -->  00:12:00.869
a circle, which is this one, but three quarters.
262

262

00:12:00.869  -->  00:12:02.036
Let's do that.
263

263

00:12:04.685  -->  00:12:06.352
180 minus 45 is 135.
264

264

00:12:08.862  -->  00:12:12.202
This is just a small nuance that I'm adding here.
265

265

00:12:12.202  -->  00:12:14.960
It's basically the same.
266

266

00:12:14.960  -->  00:12:16.543
Oh, that's the one.
267

267

00:12:18.002  -->  00:12:19.659
Here we go.
268

268

00:12:19.659  -->  00:12:20.763
That's it.
269

269

00:12:20.763  -->  00:12:21.922
That's really it.
270

270

00:12:21.922  -->  00:12:22.818
It's working now.
271

271

00:12:22.818  -->  00:12:24.268
It's working great.
272

272

00:12:24.268  -->  00:12:26.426
It looks beautiful.
273

273

00:12:26.426  -->  00:12:28.426
It is really fantastic.
274

274

00:12:28.426  -->  00:12:31.106
Now, I promised to show you another property, which I
275

275

00:12:31.106  -->  00:12:32.283
didn't really show you because I'm
276

276

00:12:32.283  -->  00:12:33.898
not actually needing it.
277

277

00:12:33.898  -->  00:12:36.435
That one is called, "transform origin."
278

278

00:12:36.435  -->  00:12:37.995
What that does is, basically,
279

279

00:12:37.995  -->  00:12:41.314
it describes where the transformation happens.
280

280

00:12:41.314  -->  00:12:42.147
Okay?
281

281

00:12:42.147  -->  00:12:46.314
Let me show that to you, for example, here in one of these.
282

282

00:12:48.352  -->  00:12:50.848
Just the before one.
283

283

00:12:50.848  -->  00:12:52.265
Transform origin.
284

284

00:12:54.408  -->  00:12:58.396
Believe me, sometimes this can be useful just for variety.
285

285

00:12:58.396  -->  00:13:00.515
I will make this animation a bit slower,
286

286

00:13:00.515  -->  00:13:04.015
so we can see what's going on here better.
287

287

00:13:05.471  -->  00:13:07.758
That's what happens when you say that the origin
288

288

00:13:07.758  -->  00:13:09.783
of the transformation should be at the right side.
289

289

00:13:09.783  -->  00:13:12.759
Let's take a look at that again.
290

290

00:13:12.759  -->  00:13:14.255
You see what happens?
291

291

00:13:14.255  -->  00:13:17.072
I've set it to be on the right side.
292

292

00:13:17.072  -->  00:13:18.960
What this does is that the center of the rotation
293

293

00:13:18.960  -->  00:13:21.960
is at the right side of the element.
294

294

00:13:22.958  -->  00:13:24.041
You see that?
295

295

00:13:24.918  -->  00:13:27.854
It doesn't quite look like it because we're also,
296

296

00:13:27.854  -->  00:13:31.709
at the same time, moving it to another position
297

297

00:13:31.709  -->  00:13:35.599
because of this top transformation which is happening
298

298

00:13:35.599  -->  00:13:36.866
right here, as well.
299

299

00:13:36.866  -->  00:13:38.079
Let me take that out.
300

300

00:13:38.079  -->  00:13:39.779
This is just to show you.
301

301

00:13:39.779  -->  00:13:42.196
We will put it back in a bit.
302

302

00:13:44.453  -->  00:13:47.393
Now, you can see everything clearer, especially on this one.
303

303

00:13:47.393  -->  00:13:50.137
This stays at the exact same place.
304

304

00:13:50.137  -->  00:13:53.097
This is the only one where I had changed it.
305

305

00:13:53.097  -->  00:13:55.465
It should only be happening here.
306

306

00:13:55.465  -->  00:13:57.587
This is in the right side of the element.
307

307

00:13:57.587  -->  00:13:59.961
The rotation happens now around this point.
308

308

00:13:59.961  -->  00:14:00.794
Take a look again.
309

309

00:14:00.794  -->  00:14:01.627
You see it?
310

310

00:14:01.627  -->  00:14:03.545
It stays there.
311

311

00:14:03.545  -->  00:14:04.378
Let's put it to left side now.
312

312

00:14:04.378  -->  00:14:06.593
Just take a look.
313

313

00:14:06.593  -->  00:14:09.850
Remember, I only did this at the before, so
314

314

00:14:09.850  -->  00:14:12.922
the after doesn't matter here.
315

315

00:14:12.922  -->  00:14:14.986
Let's put it at left.
316

316

00:14:14.986  -->  00:14:17.363
This is what it looks like then.
317

317

00:14:17.363  -->  00:14:20.186
Now, it will probably be around this point, here, right?
318

318

00:14:20.186  -->  00:14:21.019
Let's see.
319

319

00:14:22.018  -->  00:14:24.266
Yes, actually that is what happens.
320

320

00:14:24.266  -->  00:14:29.159
Sometimes, when we rotate something, for example,
321

321

00:14:29.159  -->  00:14:31.575
this can be really helpful in order to rotate it exactly
322

322

00:14:31.575  -->  00:14:32.607
where we want it.
323

323

00:14:32.607  -->  00:14:34.599
If you don't specify it at all, then it's basically
324

324

00:14:34.599  -->  00:14:35.663
just in the center.
325

325

00:14:35.663  -->  00:14:37.079
That's what you can observe here.
326

326

00:14:37.079  -->  00:14:41.246
It rotates around this point, here, in the center.
327

327

00:14:43.172  -->  00:14:46.546
Just to show you another property, which can
328

328

00:14:46.546  -->  00:14:48.213
be helpful at times.
329

329

00:14:49.210  -->  00:14:51.127
Put this one here back.
330

330

00:14:52.602  -->  00:14:54.269
I think that was it.
331

331

00:14:58.338  -->  00:15:01.505
Okay, I also have to change the speed.
332

332

00:15:06.747  -->  00:15:07.659
Here we go.
333

333

00:15:07.659  -->  00:15:08.492
That's it.
334

334

00:15:09.715  -->  00:15:11.195
That's our animation.
335

335

00:15:11.195  -->  00:15:12.028
Really fine.
336

336

00:15:12.028  -->  00:15:12.955
Really great.
337

337

00:15:12.955  -->  00:15:13.820
Now, all we have to do, really, to finish this project -
338

338

00:15:13.820  -->  00:15:14.653
well, at least the first part of the project, because
339

339

00:15:14.653  -->  00:15:17.320
we have a second part coming up.
340

340

00:15:19.787  -->  00:15:23.954
To finish this entire project, what we have to do is this.
341

341

00:15:26.796  -->  00:15:29.260
This very nice popup, here, this is what we
342

342

00:15:29.260  -->  00:15:33.343
are going to do over the next couple of lectures.
