00:00:01.750  -->  00:00:02.966
<v Instructor>All right, let's now finish</v>
2

2

00:00:02.966  -->  00:00:05.473
the header in this third part.
3

3

00:00:05.473  -->  00:00:07.454
So we formatted the logo,
4

4

00:00:07.454  -->  00:00:10.041
we formatted the search bar,
5

5

00:00:10.041  -->  00:00:12.642
now it's time to format the user navigation.
6

6

00:00:12.642  -->  00:00:13.990
And the first thing we have to do
7

7

00:00:13.990  -->  00:00:16.112
is to put these three elements,
8

8

00:00:16.112  -->  00:00:18.425
so this one, this one, and this one here
9

9

00:00:18.425  -->  00:00:20.105
all side by side.
10

10

00:00:20.105  -->  00:00:23.405
And so what's better than using flex box for that, right?
11

11

00:00:23.405  -->  00:00:26.905
So down here, we have the user navigation,
12

12

00:00:28.884  -->  00:00:32.822
and so we're gonna set display to flex
13

13

00:00:32.822  -->  00:00:35.615
to turn this into a flex container.
14

14

00:00:35.615  -->  00:00:37.588
And so once again we have the situation
15

15

00:00:37.588  -->  00:00:40.265
that we had with the search bar before,
16

16

00:00:40.265  -->  00:00:42.699
where a flex item is also at the same time
17

17

00:00:42.699  -->  00:00:44.150
a flex container.
18

18

00:00:44.150  -->  00:00:45.520
And that is completely normal,
19

19

00:00:45.520  -->  00:00:47.304
it's no problem to do that.
20

20

00:00:47.304  -->  00:00:48.628
And it's actually pretty common,
21

21

00:00:48.628  -->  00:00:50.934
as you will see throughout the rest of the project.
22

22

00:00:50.934  -->  00:00:52.240
We're gonna do that all the time.
23

23

00:00:52.240  -->  00:00:56.240
So display flex, and this is what it looks like.
24

24

00:00:57.306  -->  00:00:59.582
Now the next step is to vertically center
25

25

00:00:59.582  -->  00:01:01.203
these elements here, right?
26

26

00:01:01.203  -->  00:01:03.203
So along the cross axis.
27

27

00:01:04.711  -->  00:01:08.128
And so we use align items, set to center.
28

28

00:01:10.830  -->  00:01:14.698
And so that's what we get, and that's much better.
29

29

00:01:14.698  -->  00:01:16.108
So what can we do next?
30

30

00:01:16.108  -->  00:01:18.318
Well let's take a look at this here,
31

31

00:01:18.318  -->  00:01:19.750
and so the next thing that I wanna do
32

32

00:01:19.750  -->  00:01:22.043
is to apply the spacing here.
33

33

00:01:22.043  -->  00:01:23.432
Oh, what's going on here.
34

34

00:01:23.432  -->  00:01:24.659
Let's reload it.
35

35

00:01:24.659  -->  00:01:26.030
Ah, right.
36

36

00:01:26.030  -->  00:01:27.124
So the next thing that I wanna do
37

37

00:01:27.124  -->  00:01:31.028
is to give it this spacing here between these boxes
38

38

00:01:31.028  -->  00:01:34.861
and then also this gray background color on hover, right?
39

39

00:01:34.861  -->  00:01:37.600
So let's very quickly implement that.
40

40

00:01:37.600  -->  00:01:41.028
So where we want the space to happen is basically
41

41

00:01:41.028  -->  00:01:43.855
on the user-nav-icon-box
42

42

00:01:43.855  -->  00:01:47.553
and this one and the user, so these two classes.
43

43

00:01:47.553  -->  00:01:50.141
Now we could go ahead and group them,
44

44

00:01:50.141  -->  00:01:53.690
so make a selector for icon box and user at the same time,
45

45

00:01:53.690  -->  00:01:55.772
but I'm simply gonna do it like this.
46

46

00:01:55.772  -->  00:02:00.246
So the user nav and then all of the direct children.
47

47

00:02:00.246  -->  00:02:02.256
And that will have the exact same effect, right?
48

48

00:02:02.256  -->  00:02:04.813
Because we only select the direct children,
49

49

00:02:04.813  -->  00:02:06.489
which is what that selector here does.
50

50

00:02:06.489  -->  00:02:09.461
So all we do is to select this element,
51

51

00:02:09.461  -->  00:02:11.366
this element, and this one.
52

52

00:02:11.366  -->  00:02:15.158
That's exactly what I was saying before, right?
53

53

00:02:15.158  -->  00:02:18.883
So first some padding, and we want zero on the top
54

54

00:02:18.883  -->  00:02:22.216
and two on the left and right, so 2 rem.
55

55

00:02:23.153  -->  00:02:25.205
And we want it to have a cursor
56

56

00:02:25.205  -->  00:02:27.130
in the form of a pointer.
57

57

00:02:27.130  -->  00:02:30.797
So I don't know if you saw that in the demo,
58

58

00:02:31.878  -->  00:02:35.461
and now let's take care of that background.
59

59

00:02:38.379  -->  00:02:39.945
So we select all of them again,
60

60

00:02:39.945  -->  00:02:42.210
but this time on hover, and what we want to happen
61

61

00:02:42.210  -->  00:02:46.377
is the background color set to our gray light two color.
62

62

00:02:48.516  -->  00:02:50.357
So let's copy that from here because it's a lot
63

63

00:02:50.357  -->  00:02:52.024
of code to type out.
64

64

00:02:54.813  -->  00:02:55.881
So this one here.
65

65

00:02:55.881  -->  00:02:57.766
Now that's not gonna work as expected,
66

66

00:02:57.766  -->  00:02:59.660
but I'm going to show it to you why.
67

67

00:02:59.660  -->  00:03:02.070
So this is the gray hover for this icon box,
68

68

00:03:02.070  -->  00:03:05.402
for this icon box, and then for the user.
69

69

00:03:05.402  -->  00:03:07.305
So the height of this entire navigation bar here
70

70

00:03:07.305  -->  00:03:10.434
is given by the height of this element here, right?
71

71

00:03:10.434  -->  00:03:11.931
But that's not really what we want.
72

72

00:03:11.931  -->  00:03:14.754
We want this nav bar to fill this entire space
73

73

00:03:14.754  -->  00:03:16.445
all the way from the beginning of the header
74

74

00:03:16.445  -->  00:03:17.362
to the end.
75

75

00:03:18.223  -->  00:03:20.531
So how can we actually achieve that?
76

76

00:03:20.531  -->  00:03:23.189
And there's one great flex box property for that,
77

77

00:03:23.189  -->  00:03:24.198
which I showed you before,
78

78

00:03:24.198  -->  00:03:26.900
and it's called align-self.
79

79

00:03:26.900  -->  00:03:28.256
So this is like align-items,
80

80

00:03:28.256  -->  00:03:31.589
but for one individual flex item, right?
81

81

00:03:32.831  -->  00:03:36.998
So align-self, and we want this one set to stretch.
82

82

00:03:39.643  -->  00:03:42.143
Okay, so remember that in the header here
83

83

00:03:42.143  -->  00:03:44.821
we set the align-items to center.
84

84

00:03:44.821  -->  00:03:46.568
And that's why the three elements,
85

85

00:03:46.568  -->  00:03:48.903
the logo, the search bar, and the user nav,
86

86

00:03:48.903  -->  00:03:50.553
are vertically centered.
87

87

00:03:50.553  -->  00:03:52.202
But in fact we don't want the nav bar
88

88

00:03:52.202  -->  00:03:53.582
to be vertically centered.
89

89

00:03:53.582  -->  00:03:55.796
And so we override the align-items here
90

90

00:03:55.796  -->  00:03:59.045
with align-self, setting it to stretch,
91

91

00:03:59.045  -->  00:04:02.199
which will then produce this result.
92

92

00:04:02.199  -->  00:04:04.016
Okay and so that's much better.
93

93

00:04:04.016  -->  00:04:06.116
Now all we have to do to fix the fact
94

94

00:04:06.116  -->  00:04:08.706
that this hovering here is not going all the way
95

95

00:04:08.706  -->  00:04:09.694
from the top to the bottom
96

96

00:04:09.694  -->  00:04:14.662
is to then set the height of all of these elements
97

97

00:04:14.662  -->  00:04:15.745
to 100%.
98

98

00:04:17.675  -->  00:04:19.562
So let's check it out now.
99

99

00:04:19.562  -->  00:04:21.210
And so here we go,
100

100

00:04:21.210  -->  00:04:24.169
now it's hovering the entire area, okay?
101

101

00:04:24.169  -->  00:04:27.463
And so that is the power of align-self.
102

102

00:04:27.463  -->  00:04:29.022
Now what's happening here, of course,
103

103

00:04:29.022  -->  00:04:30.685
is that this icon and this text
104

104

00:04:30.685  -->  00:04:33.833
is all the way at the top of its parent element.
105

105

00:04:33.833  -->  00:04:36.498
That's completely normal, but we should fix that.
106

106

00:04:36.498  -->  00:04:39.969
It should obviously be centered here vertically, right?
107

107

00:04:39.969  -->  00:04:41.578
And I'm sure that by now you can guess
108

108

00:04:41.578  -->  00:04:42.860
how we're gonna do that.
109

109

00:04:42.860  -->  00:04:45.484
So flex box to the rescue.
110

110

00:04:45.484  -->  00:04:48.035
So let's go to the icon box,
111

111

00:04:48.035  -->  00:04:52.202
display, flex, and then align-items, set to center.
112

112

00:04:57.399  -->  00:04:59.513
So once more remember that align-items
113

113

00:04:59.513  -->  00:05:02.746
aligns the flex items along the cross axis,
114

114

00:05:02.746  -->  00:05:04.656
and so usually vertically.
115

115

00:05:04.656  -->  00:05:05.871
And that's exactly what we want.
116

116

00:05:05.871  -->  00:05:07.247
So we want to center it vertically,
117

117

00:05:07.247  -->  00:05:09.395
so we use align-items.
118

118

00:05:09.395  -->  00:05:11.343
And so now you see that we are already
119

119

00:05:11.343  -->  00:05:15.093
at the third level of flex containers, right?
120

120

00:05:17.330  -->  00:05:18.390
So that actually works.
121

121

00:05:18.390  -->  00:05:20.674
So the header is a flex container,
122

122

00:05:20.674  -->  00:05:23.744
then the nav bar here, all of this element
123

123

00:05:23.744  -->  00:05:24.982
is a flex container,
124

124

00:05:24.982  -->  00:05:29.411
and now the icon box itself is a flex container as well.
125

125

00:05:29.411  -->  00:05:31.168
So we're already at the third level
126

126

00:05:31.168  -->  00:05:32.446
of flex containers.
127

127

00:05:32.446  -->  00:05:34.289
And once more, that's no problem,
128

128

00:05:34.289  -->  00:05:35.956
that is absolutely okay, that is just
129

129

00:05:35.956  -->  00:05:38.252
how flex box works really.
130

130

00:05:38.252  -->  00:05:39.577
And actually, since we're doing this,
131

131

00:05:39.577  -->  00:05:41.616
we should actually do the same thing here
132

132

00:05:41.616  -->  00:05:42.886
with the user, right?
133

133

00:05:42.886  -->  00:05:45.380
So all of this should also be vertically centered.
134

134

00:05:45.380  -->  00:05:48.042
And so instead of putting it here in the icon box
135

135

00:05:48.042  -->  00:05:49.119
where we put it,
136

136

00:05:49.119  -->  00:05:51.369
we can actually put it here
137

137

00:05:52.314  -->  00:05:55.471
so that we do it to all of the direct children.
138

138

00:05:55.471  -->  00:06:00.078
So the two icon boxes as well as the user, okay?
139

139

00:06:00.078  -->  00:06:01.319
And so that is much better.
140

140

00:06:01.319  -->  00:06:03.608
So all of these three are now effectively
141

141

00:06:03.608  -->  00:06:06.028
flex containers as well.
142

142

00:06:06.028  -->  00:06:08.787
All right, so let's now take care of these icons here.
143

143

00:06:08.787  -->  00:06:09.918
So changing the color,
144

144

00:06:09.918  -->  00:06:13.884
and then formatting the notification here as well.
145

145

00:06:13.884  -->  00:06:15.872
So as for the icon,
146

146

00:06:15.872  -->  00:06:18.260
we already have its height and its width,
147

147

00:06:18.260  -->  00:06:21.431
now let's also take care of the color of the icon.
148

148

00:06:21.431  -->  00:06:24.355
So once again,let's use the fill property,
149

149

00:06:24.355  -->  00:06:26.522
setting it to a dark gray.
150

150

00:06:27.855  -->  00:06:30.938
So the same one as well, where is it?
151

151

00:06:32.984  -->  00:06:35.543
Actually it's not here anywhere.
152

152

00:06:35.543  -->  00:06:37.960
So let's just copy this here,
153

153

00:06:39.546  -->  00:06:40.532
and then change it.
154

154

00:06:40.532  -->  00:06:42.782
So color-gray-dark-2, okay?
155

155

00:06:45.499  -->  00:06:47.877
So that's this one,
156

156

00:06:47.877  -->  00:06:48.710
so #777.
157

157

00:06:50.628  -->  00:06:51.684
So that's the color,
158

158

00:06:51.684  -->  00:06:54.506
now let's format the notification here.
159

159

00:06:54.506  -->  00:06:57.839
So it should have a font size of .8 rem,
160

160

00:07:00.334  -->  00:07:01.667
so really small.
161

161

00:07:02.521  -->  00:07:05.938
Then a height of 1.75 and a width as well
162

162

00:07:07.550  -->  00:07:09.550
of .75 rem, so point 75,
163

163

00:07:12.881  -->  00:07:14.381
and here the same.
164

164

00:07:18.611  -->  00:07:22.028
And then a border-radius set to 50%.
165

165

00:07:23.891  -->  00:07:26.201
And actually here it's 1.75,
166

166

00:07:26.201  -->  00:07:27.973
so such as I had it in the beginning.
167

167

00:07:27.973  -->  00:07:28.973
So 1.75 rem.
168

168

00:07:30.814  -->  00:07:34.981
Then the background color should be our primary pink color.
169

169

00:07:40.203  -->  00:07:41.518
So that's our primary color,
170

170

00:07:41.518  -->  00:07:45.823
and then the text in there should be white.
171

171

00:07:45.823  -->  00:07:48.772
And so I'm just gonna use #fff here again,
172

172

00:07:48.772  -->  00:07:51.522
and so let's take a look at that.
173

173

00:07:52.680  -->  00:07:54.053
And that looks pretty good already.
174

174

00:07:54.053  -->  00:07:56.712
Now we have to actually position this element here
175

175

00:07:56.712  -->  00:07:59.354
on top of the icon, right?
176

176

00:07:59.354  -->  00:08:01.437
And so the best way of that is this time
177

177

00:08:01.437  -->  00:08:02.728
not using flex box.
178

178

00:08:02.728  -->  00:08:05.040
So flex box doesn't really give us a way
179

179

00:08:05.040  -->  00:08:07.219
to perfectly position an element
180

180

00:08:07.219  -->  00:08:08.961
exactly where we want it,
181

181

00:08:08.961  -->  00:08:09.928
but isntead we're just gonna use
182

182

00:08:09.928  -->  00:08:12.639
absolute positioning here, okay?
183

183

00:08:12.639  -->  00:08:14.056
So let's do that.
184

184

00:08:15.814  -->  00:08:18.653
So position absolute, and then remember
185

185

00:08:18.653  -->  00:08:20.305
that the parent element should be set
186

186

00:08:20.305  -->  00:08:22.055
to position relative.
187

187

00:08:23.279  -->  00:08:25.446
So position relative here.
188

188

00:08:26.871  -->  00:08:30.391
And now let's say we want it on the top
189

189

00:08:30.391  -->  00:08:33.974
like zero, and from the right like one rem.
190

190

00:08:36.709  -->  00:08:38.993
Just to experiment with this.
191

191

00:08:38.993  -->  00:08:40.460
And somehow it's gone,
192

192

00:08:40.460  -->  00:08:41.923
I see it's up here now,
193

193

00:08:41.923  -->  00:08:44.190
and I'm not really sure why that is.
194

194

00:08:44.190  -->  00:08:47.973
So I guess maybe it's best to remove this
195

195

00:08:47.973  -->  00:08:49.464
position relative from here,
196

196

00:08:49.464  -->  00:08:51.368
and put it here.
197

197

00:08:51.368  -->  00:08:53.178
So maybe it doesn't work that well
198

198

00:08:53.178  -->  00:08:56.156
on an SVG element, which the icon is in fact.
199

199

00:08:56.156  -->  00:08:59.941
And so let's just put it on the icon box.
200

200

00:08:59.941  -->  00:09:01.909
And so yeah, that works much better.
201

201

00:09:01.909  -->  00:09:05.000
Now we just have to move it down a little bit.
202

202

00:09:05.000  -->  00:09:06.667
So top like 1.5 rem.
203

203

00:09:12.763  -->  00:09:13.881
All right, here we go.
204

204

00:09:13.881  -->  00:09:18.059
Now just maybe a bit more to the left side, so
205

205

00:09:18.059  -->  00:09:20.180
increase it here, so 1.1 rem,
206

206

00:09:20.180  -->  00:09:21.733
but that should be perfect already.
207

207

00:09:21.733  -->  00:09:25.248
Now let's just get rid of this background color here,
208

208

00:09:25.248  -->  00:09:27.870
it looks kind of silly by now,
209

209

00:09:27.870  -->  00:09:30.037
and yeah, so that's great.
210

210

00:09:31.261  -->  00:09:34.819
Now all we have to do is to like center this text in here,
211

211

00:09:34.819  -->  00:09:37.437
both horizontally and vertically.
212

212

00:09:37.437  -->  00:09:40.556
And so let me tell you another secret,
213

213

00:09:40.556  -->  00:09:42.090
let's say, which is
214

214

00:09:42.090  -->  00:09:45.175
that we can actually use flex box for that as well.
215

215

00:09:45.175  -->  00:09:46.835
So flex box doesn't only work
216

216

00:09:46.835  -->  00:09:48.344
when we have child elements,
217

217

00:09:48.344  -->  00:09:50.927
but it works with text as well.
218

218

00:09:52.366  -->  00:09:53.699
So display flex,
219

219

00:09:55.965  -->  00:10:00.134
and now we simply have to say justify-content, center,
220

220

00:10:00.134  -->  00:10:02.916
which centers the content horizontally,
221

221

00:10:02.916  -->  00:10:06.157
and align-items also to center,
222

222

00:10:06.157  -->  00:10:08.834
which is gonna center it vertically.
223

223

00:10:08.834  -->  00:10:10.237
So let's take a look at that,
224

224

00:10:10.237  -->  00:10:12.778
and in fact you see that it works.
225

225

00:10:12.778  -->  00:10:14.111
So in this case you actually have now
226

226

00:10:14.111  -->  00:10:17.276
four levels of flex box, one inside of another.
227

227

00:10:17.276  -->  00:10:18.787
Now what you see here maybe is
228

228

00:10:18.787  -->  00:10:21.364
this is not really a circle here,
229

229

00:10:21.364  -->  00:10:23.226
and I think that's because
230

230

00:10:23.226  -->  00:10:27.228
this text, so this text here is larger than this one.
231

231

00:10:27.228  -->  00:10:28.867
You see this one is like a perfect circle,
232

232

00:10:28.867  -->  00:10:30.399
but this one is not.
233

233

00:10:30.399  -->  00:10:33.482
So I think we shouldn't use border radius of 50% here,
234

234

00:10:33.482  -->  00:10:37.693
but instead just like a very high number,
235

235

00:10:37.693  -->  00:10:41.434
so just as we did before here on this part,
236

236

00:10:41.434  -->  00:10:43.617
and actually it looks the exact same way.
237

237

00:10:43.617  -->  00:10:46.925
But never mind, this is really not a problem, all right?
238

238

00:10:46.925  -->  00:10:49.145
Now all we have to do is give it some space here
239

239

00:10:49.145  -->  00:10:50.211
on this user photo,
240

240

00:10:50.211  -->  00:10:53.315
and then, I think, we are good to go.
241

241

00:10:53.315  -->  00:10:57.482
So the user photo, margin-left, and let's say 1 rem,
242

242

00:10:59.968  -->  00:11:01.523
and actually we don't really need
243

243

00:11:01.523  -->  00:11:03.494
to format this user here,
244

244

00:11:03.494  -->  00:11:06.090
because we already did it up here with this selector
245

245

00:11:06.090  -->  00:11:08.416
where we selected all of the elements at once
246

246

00:11:08.416  -->  00:11:12.919
and user name also doesn't really need to be selected,
247

247

00:11:12.919  -->  00:11:17.155
because there's no style applying to it, okay?
248

248

00:11:17.155  -->  00:11:19.534
Let's actually set this here back to 50%,
249

249

00:11:19.534  -->  00:11:21.601
because that's a cleaner solution,
250

250

00:11:21.601  -->  00:11:25.768
and so with that I think that this is ready.
251

251

00:11:25.768  -->  00:11:27.757
Well something here is not right,
252

252

00:11:27.757  -->  00:11:31.924
and the, of course it's not margin-left, it's margin-right.
253

253

00:11:33.770  -->  00:11:35.557
Okay, now this here looks like
254

254

00:11:35.557  -->  00:11:37.483
it has a lot more space here on this side
255

255

00:11:37.483  -->  00:11:38.552
than it has here,
256

256

00:11:38.552  -->  00:11:40.449
so it's not really symmetric,
257

257

00:11:40.449  -->  00:11:43.898
so let's change that one very quickly.
258

258

00:11:43.898  -->  00:11:45.731
So to 2 rem, and okay.
259

259

00:11:48.392  -->  00:11:50.836
So our hover here is also working,
260

260

00:11:50.836  -->  00:11:52.858
let's compare it with this one here,
261

261

00:11:52.858  -->  00:11:56.585
and you see it actually is exactly the same.
262

262

00:11:56.585  -->  00:11:58.274
And so it's perfect.
263

263

00:11:58.274  -->  00:12:00.624
All right, so I hope that these first couple of lectures
264

264

00:12:00.624  -->  00:12:03.017
were really helpful for you to start grasping
265

265

00:12:03.017  -->  00:12:05.455
the concepts that are behind flex box,
266

266

00:12:05.455  -->  00:12:07.270
and the different properties that we can use
267

267

00:12:07.270  -->  00:12:10.043
to align different elements in different situations
268

268

00:12:10.043  -->  00:12:11.483
like the ones that I showed you
269

269

00:12:11.483  -->  00:12:12.979
up until this point.
270

270

00:12:12.979  -->  00:12:14.525
Now there's a lot more content to come,
271

271

00:12:14.525  -->  00:12:16.616
and a lot more flex box to use,
272

272

00:12:16.616  -->  00:12:18.620
so stay tuned for all of these lectures
273

273

00:12:18.620  -->  00:12:19.920
that are to follow.
274

274

00:12:19.920  -->  00:12:21.420
See you next time.
