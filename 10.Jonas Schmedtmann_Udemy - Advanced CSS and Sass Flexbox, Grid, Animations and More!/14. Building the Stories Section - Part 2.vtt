<v Instructor>Continuing building the story section</v>
2

2

00:00:03.805  -->  00:00:05.934
that we've been building in the last lecture,
3

3

00:00:05.934  -->  00:00:08.746
we will now implement this hover affect
4

4

00:00:08.746  -->  00:00:10.364
that we have here.
5

5

00:00:10.364  -->  00:00:12.631
So as soon as we hover a story,
6

6

00:00:12.631  -->  00:00:15.377
we have two things going on in that image.
7

7

00:00:15.377  -->  00:00:18.912
So first take a look and see what the image is doing.
8

8

00:00:18.912  -->  00:00:21.859
So basically the image is zooming out.
9

9

00:00:21.859  -->  00:00:24.466
And then we have the text moving in.
10

10

00:00:24.466  -->  00:00:27.660
And also the image getting blurred.
11

11

00:00:27.660  -->  00:00:30.094
So, the image moved away and blurs,
12

12

00:00:30.094  -->  00:00:32.285
and the text moves up and fades in.
13

13

00:00:32.285  -->  00:00:34.975
Okay, and so, that's a really nice effect I thought.
14

14

00:00:34.975  -->  00:00:37.754
And so, I included here in the course.
15

15

00:00:37.754  -->  00:00:40.439
So, let's start by adding the text actually,
16

16

00:00:40.439  -->  00:00:43.356
which will be our fig caption here.
17

17

00:00:44.938  -->  00:00:48.505
So, a special HTML element for captions
18

18

00:00:48.505  -->  00:00:49.536
for figures.
19

19

00:00:49.536  -->  00:00:50.369
So fig
20

20

00:00:52.148  -->  00:00:56.315
caption, and I'm calling it story caption very simply.
21

21

00:00:59.724  -->  00:01:02.254
And so, let's just put the name of the person here.
22

22

00:01:02.254  -->  00:01:04.087
And it was Mary Smith.
23

23

00:01:05.411  -->  00:01:06.328
Mary Smith.
24

24

00:01:08.062  -->  00:01:10.367
All right, now, where do we want this caption
25

25

00:01:10.367  -->  00:01:11.534
to be located?
26

26

00:01:12.868  -->  00:01:17.035
Well, we want it to be exactly on top of the image.
27

27

00:01:20.244  -->  00:01:23.778
So, nicely centered on top of the image.
28

28

00:01:23.778  -->  00:01:25.084
Let's take a look at that again.
29

29

00:01:25.084  -->  00:01:27.237
So here, it's exactly in the middle
30

30

00:01:27.237  -->  00:01:29.354
both vertically and horizontally.
31

31

00:01:29.354  -->  00:01:31.178
So let's do that.
32

32

00:01:31.178  -->  00:01:33.634
And I'm sure you can guess it,
33

33

00:01:33.634  -->  00:01:35.717
we use position absolute.
34

34

00:01:37.003  -->  00:01:39.687
And then you can also guess that we need to set
35

35

00:01:39.687  -->  00:01:42.125
the container to position relative.
36

36

00:01:42.125  -->  00:01:46.495
And the container is in this case the story shape.
37

37

00:01:46.495  -->  00:01:48.245
So position relative.
38

38

00:01:52.684  -->  00:01:55.314
And then here it's the same thing as always.
39

39

00:01:55.314  -->  00:01:56.731
So, top 50%.
40

40

00:01:58.830  -->  00:01:59.997
Left 50%.
41

41

00:02:01.317  -->  00:02:02.900
And then translate.
42

42

00:02:07.407  -->  00:02:10.960
Minus 50%, and minus 50%.
43

43

00:02:10.960  -->  00:02:13.916
And this time I don't have to explain again to you
44

44

00:02:13.916  -->  00:02:15.280
why this works this way.
45

45

00:02:15.280  -->  00:02:16.447
All right, so,
46

46

00:02:19.918  -->  00:02:22.585
the color of the text was white.
47

47

00:02:24.872  -->  00:02:26.205
With upper case,
48

48

00:02:30.382  -->  00:02:34.215
also with a nice font size, let's say 1.7 rem.
49

49

00:02:35.460  -->  00:02:38.340
And, of course, the text in there, in this box,
50

50

00:02:38.340  -->  00:02:40.840
should also be centered.
51

51

00:02:40.840  -->  00:02:44.090
Okay, so let's take a look at that now.
52

52

00:02:46.864  -->  00:02:49.966
All right, so it's nicely in the center here.
53

53

00:02:49.966  -->  00:02:52.131
Now, what we want here to happen actually
54

54

00:02:52.131  -->  00:02:54.176
is why we hover this box here.
55

55

00:02:54.176  -->  00:02:57.013
So the story is that this here moves up
56

56

00:02:57.013  -->  00:02:59.678
to the position and fades in.
57

57

00:02:59.678  -->  00:03:02.044
So what this means is that before we hover it,
58

58

00:03:02.044  -->  00:03:04.114
it actually needs to be invisible,
59

59

00:03:04.114  -->  00:03:07.329
and it needs to be further down to this direction.
60

60

00:03:07.329  -->  00:03:11.615
So, down here so that it can then move up.
61

61

00:03:11.615  -->  00:03:14.068
So, we should translate it down.
62

62

00:03:14.068  -->  00:03:16.189
But actually we already have the translate here.
63

63

00:03:16.189  -->  00:03:18.362
So it's minus 50 and minus 50.
64

64

00:03:18.362  -->  00:03:20.791
And so, here on the epsilon coordinate,
65

65

00:03:20.791  -->  00:03:24.507
we can actually put zero again because then it would be
66

66

00:03:24.507  -->  00:03:26.090
a bit further down.
67

67

00:03:27.147  -->  00:03:29.646
You see, so now it's in here.
68

68

00:03:29.646  -->  00:03:31.227
And we could put it even more down if we wanted.
69

69

00:03:31.227  -->  00:03:34.597
We could say like, I don't know, 20%, for example.
70

70

00:03:34.597  -->  00:03:37.517
And then it would move down even further.
71

71

00:03:37.517  -->  00:03:40.934
And then we just set the opacity to zero.
72

72

00:03:42.011  -->  00:03:44.943
And so, this is the initial state before we actually
73

73

00:03:44.943  -->  00:03:46.860
do the hover animation.
74

74

00:03:47.856  -->  00:03:49.999
Now, where does this hover actually occur?
75

75

00:03:49.999  -->  00:03:53.064
As we said, it's right here on the story.
76

76

00:03:53.064  -->  00:03:54.231
And so, we say
77

77

00:03:56.581  -->  00:04:00.593
story, so as soon as the story is hovered,
78

78

00:04:00.593  -->  00:04:04.072
then we want to change the caption.
79

79

00:04:04.072  -->  00:04:06.064
Right, make sense?
80

80

00:04:06.064  -->  00:04:09.053
So, and what do we want to change?
81

81

00:04:09.053  -->  00:04:11.434
Well, the opacity to one, of course.
82

82

00:04:11.434  -->  00:04:12.517
Antitransform
83

83

00:04:14.868  -->  00:04:16.868
should translate in y to
84

84

00:04:20.247  -->  00:04:21.497
minus 50%.
85

85

00:04:22.650  -->  00:04:24.761
Okay, and why is that?
86

86

00:04:24.761  -->  00:04:26.829
Well, it's because the minus 50%
87

87

00:04:26.829  -->  00:04:29.094
is what we had here before.
88

88

00:04:29.094  -->  00:04:31.919
Okay, so remember the initial position was
89

89

00:04:31.919  -->  00:04:33.872
with this here at minus 50.
90

90

00:04:33.872  -->  00:04:35.607
But that's not what we want.
91

91

00:04:35.607  -->  00:04:39.509
But it's what we want after we hover on the story.
92

92

00:04:39.509  -->  00:04:42.691
Now, I see a stupid mistake here once again.
93

93

00:04:42.691  -->  00:04:45.546
So it is hover, obviously it's hover.
94

94

00:04:45.546  -->  00:04:48.607
So, I just invented a new pseudoclass there.
95

95

00:04:48.607  -->  00:04:51.748
So let's just see if it works.
96

96

00:04:51.748  -->  00:04:55.305
But not before, of course, animating it as well.
97

97

00:04:55.305  -->  00:04:56.472
So transition,
98

98

00:04:59.213  -->  00:05:02.130
let's say all here and 0.5 seconds.
99

99

00:05:03.506  -->  00:05:05.673
So let's check it out now.
100

100

00:05:08.341  -->  00:05:11.096
And, well, that's not exactly what we wanted.
101

101

00:05:11.096  -->  00:05:13.215
But I think I know what the problem is here.
102

102

00:05:13.215  -->  00:05:17.714
And it is because we didn't have the exact same
103

103

00:05:17.714  -->  00:05:18.651
transform here.
104

104

00:05:18.651  -->  00:05:20.603
So it should be this exact translate.
105

105

00:05:20.603  -->  00:05:24.266
So not translate here, then translate y here.
106

106

00:05:24.266  -->  00:05:26.933
So instead, we should have this.
107

107

00:05:29.946  -->  00:05:34.299
And so, this is really minus 50% it goes.
108

108

00:05:34.299  -->  00:05:35.132
All right.
109

109

00:05:37.251  -->  00:05:39.987
Yep, so that's what we want, right?
110

110

00:05:39.987  -->  00:05:44.463
Oh, and you saw that that movement here in the end,
111

111

00:05:44.463  -->  00:05:48.153
so that little shaking, let me show it to you again.
112

112

00:05:48.153  -->  00:05:51.409
So what you see at the end, it moved a little bit.
113

113

00:05:51.409  -->  00:05:55.889
So let's add once again back face visibility
114

114

00:05:55.889  -->  00:05:57.222
to this element.
115

115

00:05:58.586  -->  00:06:02.391
So, remember we did this in the header as well.
116

116

00:06:02.391  -->  00:06:05.652
Just to fix this small glitch.
117

117

00:06:05.652  -->  00:06:08.669
And so, now it should be gone.
118

118

00:06:08.669  -->  00:06:09.502
Yup.
119

119

00:06:10.449  -->  00:06:11.858
I don't know if you saw it before,
120

120

00:06:11.858  -->  00:06:13.147
but it was definitely there.
121

121

00:06:13.147  -->  00:06:15.009
It moved like one pixel to the right side
122

122

00:06:15.009  -->  00:06:16.339
or to the left.
123

123

00:06:16.339  -->  00:06:18.777
And so, now that is absolutely gone.
124

124

00:06:18.777  -->  00:06:20.470
And so, now the second part of this animation
125

125

00:06:20.470  -->  00:06:23.440
is this image, which blurs and moves away.
126

126

00:06:23.440  -->  00:06:25.341
And actually I see that this image here is
127

127

00:06:25.341  -->  00:06:27.705
is in a different position, so this lady here
128

128

00:06:27.705  -->  00:06:29.674
is nicely centered.
129

129

00:06:29.674  -->  00:06:33.815
Well, in here, she's not, so let's take care of that.
130

130

00:06:33.815  -->  00:06:35.882
And let me show you why that happens.
131

131

00:06:35.882  -->  00:06:38.373
So this is where this image is.
132

132

00:06:38.373  -->  00:06:40.030
You see this blue box?
133

133

00:06:40.030  -->  00:06:41.730
That's where the image is.
134

134

00:06:41.730  -->  00:06:44.889
And so, I guess we should translate the image itself
135

135

00:06:44.889  -->  00:06:48.058
to be more in the center of the figure, right?
136

136

00:06:48.058  -->  00:06:50.055
So let's do that, so let's translate
137

137

00:06:50.055  -->  00:06:52.660
this image a little bit.
138

138

00:06:52.660  -->  00:06:53.763
And where is it?
139

139

00:06:53.763  -->  00:06:55.346
Here, so transform,
140

140

00:06:56.852  -->  00:07:00.352
translate x, and let's say minus four rem.
141

141

00:07:02.928  -->  00:07:06.819
And so, now we can work on that effect
142

142

00:07:06.819  -->  00:07:08.236
that we just saw.
143

143

00:07:10.012  -->  00:07:13.840
So again is when we hover the story.
144

144

00:07:13.840  -->  00:07:18.171
And then what we want to change is actually the image.
145

145

00:07:18.171  -->  00:07:20.971
Okay, and the first thing that happened was
146

146

00:07:20.971  -->  00:07:23.638
that it basically it zoomed out.
147

147

00:07:24.734  -->  00:07:27.734
And, well, that looks a bit strange.
148

148

00:07:28.743  -->  00:07:31.110
So, somehow, because of this translation
149

149

00:07:31.110  -->  00:07:34.096
that we did here, it cut out this thing,
150

150

00:07:34.096  -->  00:07:37.534
so let's fix that, and what's going to fix that
151

151

00:07:37.534  -->  00:07:41.782
is once again back face visibility hidden.
152

152

00:07:41.782  -->  00:07:44.262
Okay, so, whatever we're dealing with these
153

153

00:07:44.262  -->  00:07:46.966
kind of animations and translating stuff,
154

154

00:07:46.966  -->  00:07:48.740
when something weird happens,
155

155

00:07:48.740  -->  00:07:52.625
then many times this back face visibility fixes that.
156

156

00:07:52.625  -->  00:07:54.571
And again, as I explained here before,
157

157

00:07:54.571  -->  00:07:58.332
I guess no one really knows why it happens this way.
158

158

00:07:58.332  -->  00:08:00.314
Or why this works this way,
159

159

00:08:00.314  -->  00:08:03.577
but what matters is that it actually does work.
160

160

00:08:03.577  -->  00:08:04.410
So, okay.
161

161

00:08:05.312  -->  00:08:07.511
I found this out myself also the hard way
162

162

00:08:07.511  -->  00:08:09.890
through a lot of experimenting and searching
163

163

00:08:09.890  -->  00:08:12.494
on stack overflow and all that stuff.
164

164

00:08:12.494  -->  00:08:15.494
And so, now I can teach that to you.
165

165

00:08:17.021  -->  00:08:20.296
So, just to make sure again how this works.
166

166

00:08:20.296  -->  00:08:22.243
We zoom out the image when we hover.
167

167

00:08:22.243  -->  00:08:24.021
So what that means is that initially
168

168

00:08:24.021  -->  00:08:25.379
we have to zoom in a bit.
169

169

00:08:25.379  -->  00:08:27.953
So scale it, basically, and then when we hover,
170

170

00:08:27.953  -->  00:08:29.695
set the scale to a lower value,
171

171

00:08:29.695  -->  00:08:32.767
so that it happens like this.
172

172

00:08:32.767  -->  00:08:36.059
Basically we scaled the image down.
173

173

00:08:36.059  -->  00:08:38.857
So let's do that, so in an initial state,
174

174

00:08:38.857  -->  00:08:40.682
we need to add some scale here.
175

175

00:08:40.682  -->  00:08:43.682
Let's say it's at 140%, so 1.4.
176

176

00:08:44.793  -->  00:08:46.993
And then as soon as we hover the image.
177

177

00:08:46.993  -->  00:08:50.910
We want it to be, well, let's actually copy it.
178

178

00:08:57.695  -->  00:09:00.111
Okay, and then we want it at one
179

179

00:09:00.111  -->  00:09:02.746
as soon as we hover it.
180

180

00:09:02.746  -->  00:09:05.163
And so, that should work now.
181

181

00:09:06.790  -->  00:09:09.408
So, let's go to our version.
182

182

00:09:09.408  -->  00:09:11.770
And, indeed, all we have to add of course
183

183

00:09:11.770  -->  00:09:13.687
is now this transition.
184

184

00:09:15.274  -->  00:09:19.441
So it's the same as this one, so let's just copy it.
185

185

00:09:21.063  -->  00:09:22.313
And here we go.
186

186

00:09:25.311  -->  00:09:26.144
Very nice.
187

187

00:09:27.141  -->  00:09:28.708
So, that looks nice already.
188

188

00:09:28.708  -->  00:09:31.553
Now all we have to do is to add that blur.
189

189

00:09:31.553  -->  00:09:33.546
And actually it's not only blur, but it also gets
190

190

00:09:33.546  -->  00:09:35.898
a bit darker as image, as we hover it.
191

191

00:09:35.898  -->  00:09:38.305
So take a look, it gets a bit darker.
192

192

00:09:38.305  -->  00:09:39.878
Maybe you didn't see is right away,
193

193

00:09:39.878  -->  00:09:42.664
but actually it did get a bit darker.
194

194

00:09:42.664  -->  00:09:46.198
And so, let's learn about filters.
195

195

00:09:46.198  -->  00:09:48.379
So there's a very nice CSS property,
196

196

00:09:48.379  -->  00:09:50.879
which is simply called filter.
197

197

00:09:52.383  -->  00:09:54.577
And in there, you have a lot of different filters
198

198

00:09:54.577  -->  00:09:56.781
that you can apply.
199

199

00:09:56.781  -->  00:09:58.364
So, let's use blur.
200

200

00:10:00.093  -->  00:10:01.208
And use three pixels.
201

201

00:10:01.208  -->  00:10:03.750
And again, I'm gonna show you different values
202

202

00:10:03.750  -->  00:10:06.616
in the dev tools, then in the inspector.
203

203

00:10:06.616  -->  00:10:09.094
And then also since we want to make it darker,
204

204

00:10:09.094  -->  00:10:11.984
let's say we want brightness.
205

205

00:10:11.984  -->  00:10:15.397
Put in a value lower than 100% makes it darker,
206

206

00:10:15.397  -->  00:10:19.564
and a value above 100% makes it brighter basically.
207

207

00:10:21.716  -->  00:10:24.466
And so, that should do the trick.
208

208

00:10:26.365  -->  00:10:28.978
So, that's it, it's blurred.
209

209

00:10:28.978  -->  00:10:31.510
And it is darker than it was before.
210

210

00:10:31.510  -->  00:10:35.463
So, let me now show you some different values.
211

211

00:10:35.463  -->  00:10:38.982
So, this is where the hover is applied.
212

212

00:10:38.982  -->  00:10:40.893
So, we can go to the dev tools.
213

213

00:10:40.893  -->  00:10:42.891
Hit this one here, and then on hover.
214

214

00:10:42.891  -->  00:10:45.631
And so, now we can see it hovered even without
215

215

00:10:45.631  -->  00:10:48.930
actually hovering it with the mouse.
216

216

00:10:48.930  -->  00:10:51.930
And then here we see our CSS styles.
217

217

00:10:53.557  -->  00:10:55.412
So we can blur it even more.
218

218

00:10:55.412  -->  00:10:56.995
So this is what it looks like when it's
219

219

00:10:56.995  -->  00:10:58.662
even really blurred.
220

220

00:11:00.658  -->  00:11:03.884
So we have three, six also looks great.
221

221

00:11:03.884  -->  00:11:05.835
But let's leave it at this.
222

222

00:11:05.835  -->  00:11:09.673
And then in here, so 100 is the original.
223

223

00:11:09.673  -->  00:11:11.859
We put it at 80, but we can make it really dark
224

224

00:11:11.859  -->  00:11:16.026
if we want, or really bright, something like this.
225

225

00:11:18.873  -->  00:11:21.261
And there are of course other filters.
226

226

00:11:21.261  -->  00:11:23.629
So we have blur, brightness, contrast,
227

227

00:11:23.629  -->  00:11:27.796
and gray scale, hew rotate, let's check that one out.
228

228

00:11:29.623  -->  00:11:33.790
50%, or maybe it's in degrees actually, if it's rotate.
229

229

00:11:36.422  -->  00:11:37.339
50 degrees.
230

230

00:11:40.759  -->  00:11:42.827
So, you see there's a difference there.
231

231

00:11:42.827  -->  00:11:45.660
So, lots of filters here going on.
232

232

00:11:47.792  -->  00:11:50.203
You could give it more opacity, saturate it,
233

233

00:11:50.203  -->  00:11:51.864
put a CPF filter.
234

234

00:11:51.864  -->  00:11:56.587
And so, you can definitely experiment with those.
235

235

00:11:56.587  -->  00:12:00.471
So, all right, this is already completed.
236

236

00:12:00.471  -->  00:12:02.255
Now, all we have to do is to add
237

237

00:12:02.255  -->  00:12:04.279
the second box below it.
238

238

00:12:04.279  -->  00:12:07.624
And then also that small button that we have here.
239

239

00:12:07.624  -->  00:12:08.707
So, this one.
240

240

00:12:10.810  -->  00:12:12.846
So that shouldn't be all too hard.
241

241

00:12:12.846  -->  00:12:15.596
Let's just head over to the HTML.
242

242

00:12:17.403  -->  00:12:21.004
And add another one of these rows.
243

243

00:12:21.004  -->  00:12:23.295
So, a number nine this time.
244

244

00:12:23.295  -->  00:12:26.128
This person is called Jack Wilson.
245

245

00:12:29.688  -->  00:12:33.188
And then let's just change this text while
246

246

00:12:34.216  -->  00:12:37.216
my live is completely different now.
247

247

00:12:43.171  -->  00:12:46.504
All right, and that should work already.
248

248

00:12:49.177  -->  00:12:51.428
Yep, so, no surprises here.
249

249

00:12:51.428  -->  00:12:53.428
It works just as before.
250

250

00:12:55.014  -->  00:12:56.985
And now just a small button here
251

251

00:12:56.985  -->  00:12:59.768
just to make it really complete.
252

252

00:12:59.768  -->  00:13:01.144
So this is pretty similar to the one
253

253

00:13:01.144  -->  00:13:03.150
that we had before in here.
254

254

00:13:03.150  -->  00:13:06.650
So here we had this green button going on.
255

255

00:13:09.761  -->  00:13:11.459
This time we want the other button.
256

256

00:13:11.459  -->  00:13:15.933
So we have the button green and the normal button,
257

257

00:13:15.933  -->  00:13:20.662
and then I think the other one is called button text.
258

258

00:13:20.662  -->  00:13:21.972
Let's see if that works.
259

259

00:13:21.972  -->  00:13:26.139
I'm not really sure, let's check it out here in the button.
260

260

00:13:28.140  -->  00:13:31.390
So, button text, so only one dash there
261

261

00:13:32.297  -->  00:13:34.774
because it's not a modifier, it's just a different name.
262

262

00:13:34.774  -->  00:13:38.274
So button text, and then read all stories.
263

263

00:13:40.682  -->  00:13:43.695
And then again that right arrow that I showed you
264

264

00:13:43.695  -->  00:13:46.612
in another lecture, so right arrow.
265

265

00:13:51.672  -->  00:13:54.755
Okay, and so, that looks pretty good.
266

266

00:13:56.942  -->  00:13:59.124
And if you take a look now and compare it to our original
267

267

00:13:59.124  -->  00:14:02.273
version, all that's left to do now is to add
268

268

00:14:02.273  -->  00:14:05.814
this background video, but that will be a separate lecture.
269

269

00:14:05.814  -->  00:14:08.607
So part three of building this sector.
270

270

00:14:08.607  -->  00:14:10.107
So, see you then.
