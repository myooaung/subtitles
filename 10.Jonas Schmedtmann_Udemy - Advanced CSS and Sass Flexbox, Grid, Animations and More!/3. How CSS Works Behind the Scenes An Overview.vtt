00:00:01.141  -->  00:00:02.383
<v Lecturer>Hello, and welcome back</v>
2

2

00:00:02.383  -->  00:00:05.888
to a more conceptual lecture this time.
3

3

00:00:05.888  -->  00:00:08.363
This is probably one of the most important lectures
4

4

00:00:08.363  -->  00:00:10.384
of the entire course.
5

5

00:00:10.384  -->  00:00:11.956
I promise you that we are going to go back
6

6

00:00:11.956  -->  00:00:14.562
to some serious coding after this section,
7

7

00:00:14.562  -->  00:00:17.864
but since you signed up for an advanced CSS course,
8

8

00:00:17.864  -->  00:00:20.176
we need to get into some advanced stuff
9

9

00:00:20.176  -->  00:00:23.854
before moving on in the course and in our project.
10

10

00:00:23.854  -->  00:00:25.599
Now, I couldn't really call this course
11

11

00:00:25.599  -->  00:00:28.541
an advanced CSS course if I wouldn't show you
12

12

00:00:28.541  -->  00:00:31.069
some of the stuff that happens behinds the scenes
13

13

00:00:31.069  -->  00:00:34.827
of CSS as we load the webpage, right?
14

14

00:00:34.827  -->  00:00:37.864
Now most, if not all, of the the other courses out there,
15

15

00:00:37.864  -->  00:00:40.149
they just teach you the coding stuff itself,
16

16

00:00:40.149  -->  00:00:42.355
but in my courses, I like to teach you
17

17

00:00:42.355  -->  00:00:46.064
how stuff actually works, and important concepts
18

18

00:00:46.064  -->  00:00:48.290
that you need to understand in order to become
19

19

00:00:48.290  -->  00:00:50.760
a better web developer and, in this case,
20

20

00:00:50.760  -->  00:00:53.084
a better CSS developer.
21

21

00:00:53.084  -->  00:00:54.758
That's what I did in my Java script course,
22

22

00:00:54.758  -->  00:00:56.110
if you took that one.
23

23

00:00:56.110  -->  00:00:58.442
And that's what I do in this course as well.
24

24

00:00:58.442  -->  00:01:00.714
So, let's take a look now.
25

25

00:01:00.714  -->  00:01:03.881
And we start by asking what actually happens to our CSS code
26

26

00:01:03.881  -->  00:01:07.244
when we load up a certain web page in a browser.
27

27

00:01:07.244  -->  00:01:09.624
Now, a bunch of stuff happens behind the scenes
28

28

00:01:09.624  -->  00:01:13.081
of the internet, until the browser can start loading
29

29

00:01:13.081  -->  00:01:14.961
that website we requested.
30

30

00:01:14.961  -->  00:01:17.418
Things like http requests, figuring out
31

31

00:01:17.418  -->  00:01:20.566
the right domain name service, etc.
32

32

00:01:20.566  -->  00:01:23.232
We're not going to focus on all of that though.
33

33

00:01:23.232  -->  00:01:25.431
Instead, we're only interested in what happens
34

34

00:01:25.431  -->  00:01:30.262
in the browser on a computer where the user opens the page.
35

35

00:01:30.262  -->  00:01:33.433
So, our starting point is when the browser actually starts
36

36

00:01:33.433  -->  00:01:36.520
to load the initial html file.
37

37

00:01:36.520  -->  00:01:40.003
It then takes the loaded html code and parses it,
38

38

00:01:40.003  -->  00:01:42.829
which basically means that it decodes the code
39

39

00:01:42.829  -->  00:01:43.912
line by line.
40

40

00:01:44.794  -->  00:01:47.250
From this process, the browser builds the so-called
41

41

00:01:47.250  -->  00:01:51.107
Document Object Model, or DOM, which basically describes
42

42

00:01:51.107  -->  00:01:54.614
the entire web document, basically like a family tree,
43

43

00:01:54.614  -->  00:01:57.884
with parents, children, and sibling elements.
44

44

00:01:57.884  -->  00:02:01.048
So, this Document Object Model is where the entire decoded
45

45

00:02:01.048  -->  00:02:02.715
html code is stored.
46

46

00:02:03.580  -->  00:02:06.655
Now, as the browser parses the html, it also finds
47

47

00:02:06.655  -->  00:02:09.388
the style sheets included in the html head,
48

48

00:02:09.388  -->  00:02:11.749
and it starts loading them as well.
49

49

00:02:11.749  -->  00:02:14.760
And just like the html, CSS is also parsed,
50

50

00:02:14.760  -->  00:02:18.111
but the parsing of CSS is a bit more complex.
51

51

00:02:18.111  -->  00:02:20.574
And that's why we'll talk about that in great detail
52

52

00:02:20.574  -->  00:02:22.252
in the next lecture.
53

53

00:02:22.252  -->  00:02:25.350
For now, let me just tell you that during the CSS parsing
54

54

00:02:25.350  -->  00:02:27.858
phase, there are two main steps.
55

55

00:02:27.858  -->  00:02:31.435
First off, conflicting CSS declarations are resolved
56

56

00:02:31.435  -->  00:02:34.510
through a process known as the cascade.
57

57

00:02:34.510  -->  00:02:36.543
The second step in a CSS parsing
58

58

00:02:36.543  -->  00:02:39.042
is to process final CSS values.
59

59

00:02:39.042  -->  00:02:41.642
For instance, converting a margin defined
60

60

00:02:41.642  -->  00:02:44.627
in percentage units to pixels.
61

61

00:02:44.627  -->  00:02:47.690
Imagine that we define the left margin as 50%,
62

62

00:02:47.690  -->  00:02:51.084
but that 50% on a smartphone is completely different
63

63

00:02:51.084  -->  00:02:54.193
than a 50% on a large screen, right?
64

64

00:02:54.193  -->  00:02:57.439
And that's why these percentages, and other relative units,
65

65

00:02:57.439  -->  00:03:00.241
can only be calculated on the user's device
66

66

00:03:00.241  -->  00:03:01.770
in the parsing phase.
67

67

00:03:01.770  -->  00:03:04.258
But, again, we're going to talk more about that
68

68

00:03:04.258  -->  00:03:06.107
over the next lectures.
69

69

00:03:06.107  -->  00:03:07.969
And, of course, I'm going to show you all of this
70

70

00:03:07.969  -->  00:03:11.160
in code as well because that's obviously the whole point
71

71

00:03:11.160  -->  00:03:13.225
of learning all of this.
72

72

00:03:13.225  -->  00:03:15.378
Alright, now after all of this is done,
73

73

00:03:15.378  -->  00:03:19.471
the final CSS is also stored in a tree-like structure
74

74

00:03:19.471  -->  00:03:23.714
called the CSS Object Model, similar to the DOM.
75

75

00:03:23.714  -->  00:03:26.961
And now that we have the html, as well as the CSS parsed
76

76

00:03:26.961  -->  00:03:31.158
and stored, these together form the so-called Render Tree.
77

77

00:03:31.158  -->  00:03:33.780
And with that, we finally have everything we need
78

78

00:03:33.780  -->  00:03:36.071
to render the page.
79

79

00:03:36.071  -->  00:03:38.112
Now, in order to actually render the page,
80

80

00:03:38.112  -->  00:03:39.837
the browser using something called
81

81

00:03:39.837  -->  00:03:42.153
the Visual Formatting Model.
82

82

00:03:42.153  -->  00:03:44.888
The algorithm calculates and uses a bunch of stuff
83

83

00:03:44.888  -->  00:03:46.765
that you already know about,
84

84

00:03:46.765  -->  00:03:50.237
like the box model, floats, and positioning.
85

85

00:03:50.237  -->  00:03:52.101
We're going to talk a little bit about how
86

86

00:03:52.101  -->  00:03:53.704
this Visual Formatting Model works
87

87

00:03:53.704  -->  00:03:56.496
in one of the next lectures, because it actually has a lot
88

88

00:03:56.496  -->  00:03:59.190
to do about how we write our code.
89

89

00:03:59.190  -->  00:04:01.540
So, stay tuned for that lecture.
90

90

00:04:01.540  -->  00:04:04.597
Okay, and so finally, after the Visual Formatting Model
91

91

00:04:04.597  -->  00:04:07.574
has done it's work, the website it's finally rendered,
92

92

00:04:07.574  -->  00:04:10.779
or painted, to the screen and the process is finished.
93

93

00:04:10.779  -->  00:04:12.058
Great!
94

94

00:04:12.058  -->  00:04:14.589
So, now you understand what happens behind the scenes
95

95

00:04:14.589  -->  00:04:17.062
of a page load in a browser.
96

96

00:04:17.062  -->  00:04:19.032
And over the next couple of lectures, you're going
97

97

00:04:19.032  -->  00:04:22.170
to understand it even better and even deeper.
98

98

00:04:22.170  -->  00:04:24.146
So, I hope that you're curious now.
99

99

00:04:24.146  -->  00:04:28.063
So let's move on to the next lecture right now.
