<v Narrator>In this lecture and the next one,</v>
2

2

00:00:03,419  -->  00:00:07,249
we are going to adapt our website to a smaller screens
3

3

00:00:07,249  -->  00:00:09,761
and so making it truly responsive.
4

4

00:00:09,761  -->  00:00:11,346
And in order to do that we are going
5

5

00:00:11,346  -->  00:00:14,558
to write a couple of media queries.
6

6

00:00:14,558  -->  00:00:17,205
So, I'm now back to Google Chrome as you
7

7

00:00:17,205  -->  00:00:20,493
can possibly see here because I like the DevTools
8

8

00:00:20,493  -->  00:00:23,203
for responsive developing much better than the ones
9

9

00:00:23,203  -->  00:00:24,835
in Firefox and so that's why I'm
10

10

00:00:24,835  -->  00:00:27,165
using Google Chrome here now.
11

11

00:00:27,165  -->  00:00:28,935
But before that let's actually take a look
12

12

00:00:28,935  -->  00:00:32,227
at the web page here in Google Chrome
13

13

00:00:32,227  -->  00:00:35,443
and we can verify that actually everything works
14

14

00:00:35,443  -->  00:00:38,569
just the same as in Firefox.
15

15

00:00:38,569  -->  00:00:39,448
Okay.
16

16

00:00:39,448  -->  00:00:41,738
So, the grid layout is fully implemented
17

17

00:00:41,738  -->  00:00:44,943
in the current Chrome and Firefox versions.
18

18

00:00:44,943  -->  00:00:48,026
So everything works exactly the same.
19

19

00:00:48,944  -->  00:00:49,777
Okay.
20

20

00:00:49,777  -->  00:00:53,756
So, that is the mobile view here in the Chrome DevTools.
21

21

00:00:53,756  -->  00:00:57,035
So, just by clicking this icon here
22

22

00:00:57,035  -->  00:01:00,555
and that brings us this responsive view here
23

23

00:01:00,555  -->  00:01:02,754
that we can then play around with.
24

24

00:01:02,754  -->  00:01:06,921
Now, I have it set here to 50%, we can set it to maybe 75
25

25

00:01:08,937  -->  00:01:11,350
and so let's take a look what happens
26

26

00:01:11,350  -->  00:01:13,860
as we decrease the screen and the first thing
27

27

00:01:13,860  -->  00:01:15,713
that comes into notice immediately
28

28

00:01:15,713  -->  00:01:19,192
is a problem here on this header, right?
29

29

00:01:19,192  -->  00:01:21,263
So, you see that these images here
30

30

00:01:21,263  -->  00:01:23,671
and also the content of the header,
31

31

00:01:23,671  -->  00:01:25,931
they start overlapping everything
32

32

00:01:25,931  -->  00:01:28,931
and that is because of these images.
33

33

00:01:29,835  -->  00:01:30,668
Okay.
34

34

00:01:30,668  -->  00:01:33,330
So, we set them to a fixed height,
35

35

00:01:33,330  -->  00:01:34,848
if I remember it correctly,
36

36

00:01:34,848  -->  00:01:38,098
it was 25 pixels or two point five rem.
37

37

00:01:39,233  -->  00:01:40,870
Yup, so here you see that
38

38

00:01:40,870  -->  00:01:43,234
and so therefore they can not really scale.
39

39

00:01:43,234  -->  00:01:45,886
So, when we reduce this, that images will stay
40

40

00:01:45,886  -->  00:01:48,786
just the same size and then this entire grid here,
41

41

00:01:48,786  -->  00:01:51,896
which is defined basically by the size of these images
42

42

00:01:51,896  -->  00:01:53,512
will also stay the same size.
43

43

00:01:53,512  -->  00:01:56,598
And the same happens for the entire grid container here
44

44

00:01:56,598  -->  00:01:58,314
and so therefore all of this content
45

45

00:01:58,314  -->  00:02:02,031
that overflows and looks crazy like this.
46

46

00:02:02,031  -->  00:02:05,480
And so the first thing that I'm gonna do is to fix that.
47

47

00:02:05,480  -->  00:02:06,313
Okay.
48

48

00:02:06,313  -->  00:02:10,409
And so instead of using height, I'm going to use min-height.
49

49

00:02:10,409  -->  00:02:12,726
So, let's open the header file here
50

50

00:02:12,726  -->  00:02:15,380
and come down here to the image.
51

51

00:02:15,380  -->  00:02:20,182
So, we had to set the max-height to two point five rem.
52

52

00:02:20,182  -->  00:02:22,148
Now what we also need to specify here
53

53

00:02:22,148  -->  00:02:24,869
is the actual width of this image
54

54

00:02:24,869  -->  00:02:28,086
because otherwise this is not going to scale properly.
55

55

00:02:28,086  -->  00:02:28,924
Okay.
56

56

00:02:28,924  -->  00:02:32,122
And so we're going to use max-width here as well
57

57

00:02:32,122  -->  00:02:34,748
and set this one to 100%.
58

58

00:02:34,748  -->  00:02:37,281
So, what max-height is going to do is
59

59

00:02:37,281  -->  00:02:39,553
that the height can be two point five rem,
60

60

00:02:39,553  -->  00:02:41,496
but it can also be less than that
61

61

00:02:41,496  -->  00:02:42,759
and the same here for the width.
62

62

00:02:42,759  -->  00:02:44,767
So, usually it should be 100%,
63

63

00:02:44,767  -->  00:02:47,131
but of course it can be less and that's what
64

64

00:02:47,131  -->  00:02:49,275
will happen when the height here
65

65

00:02:49,275  -->  00:02:51,227
gets less than two point five rem.
66

66

00:02:51,227  -->  00:02:52,106
Okay.
67

67

00:02:52,106  -->  00:02:55,158
Now, the problem is that this actually not all we have
68

68

00:02:55,158  -->  00:02:58,382
to do so let's take a look at that now
69

69

00:02:58,382  -->  00:03:01,842
and so you see that it's still not decreasing.
70

70

00:03:01,842  -->  00:03:04,503
So, why do you think that happens?
71

71

00:03:04,503  -->  00:03:07,011
And if you think about it, you will come to the conclusion
72

72

00:03:07,011  -->  00:03:09,249
that it is because of the definition
73

73

00:03:09,249  -->  00:03:10,949
that we have here in the header
74

74

00:03:10,949  -->  00:03:14,401
that the column should be the max-content, right?
75

75

00:03:14,401  -->  00:03:16,651
So, let me show that to you
76

76

00:03:18,113  -->  00:03:19,613
here in the header
77

77

00:03:21,512  -->  00:03:24,035
and down here we say that the column
78

78

00:03:24,035  -->  00:03:25,906
should be at the max-content.
79

79

00:03:25,906  -->  00:03:28,599
And so basically it should be as wide as possible
80

80

00:03:28,599  -->  00:03:30,367
in order to fit all the content,
81

81

00:03:30,367  -->  00:03:33,198
regardless of the width of the UPort
82

82

00:03:33,198  -->  00:03:34,697
or the container itself.
83

83

00:03:34,697  -->  00:03:38,280
And so, what we need to change now is that.
84

84

00:03:39,685  -->  00:03:41,432
So, what can we do here?
85

85

00:03:41,432  -->  00:03:44,849
So of course we're going to use a minmax.
86

86

00:03:45,983  -->  00:03:48,609
So, we have done that a couple of times
87

87

00:03:48,609  -->  00:03:50,853
and the most wide that this column can be
88

88

00:03:50,853  -->  00:03:52,516
is of course this max-content.
89

89

00:03:52,516  -->  00:03:56,683
So, that's the maximum, but the minimum is min-content.
90

90

00:03:58,215  -->  00:03:59,048
Right?
91

91

00:03:59,048  -->  00:04:02,103
So, we could have specified like a width here as well,
92

92

00:04:02,103  -->  00:04:05,410
like saying 10 rem or 20 rem or something like that,
93

93

00:04:05,410  -->  00:04:07,316
but instead we say here that the column
94

94

00:04:07,316  -->  00:04:11,066
should never be more narrow than the content.
95

95

00:04:13,577  -->  00:04:17,608
And that should now fix it and indeed it does fix it.
96

96

00:04:17,608  -->  00:04:21,086
It creates a couple of other problems, okay,
97

97

00:04:21,086  -->  00:04:23,719
but at least the main problem here is fixed now.
98

98

00:04:23,719  -->  00:04:25,774
Now, one thing is that these here
99

99

00:04:25,774  -->  00:04:27,497
should be vertically aligned.
100

100

00:04:27,497  -->  00:04:31,664
So, let's add that and that is here in the screen on lowest
101

101

00:04:32,515  -->  00:04:36,586
of course as well and so here we have to do align-content
102

102

00:04:36,586  -->  00:04:39,042
or actually align-items because we are talkin'
103

103

00:04:39,042  -->  00:04:42,199
about individual items inside of each cell
104

104

00:04:42,199  -->  00:04:43,994
and so that's fixed now as well
105

105

00:04:43,994  -->  00:04:47,877
and now the only problem that's left is this one here.
106

106

00:04:47,877  -->  00:04:50,539
So, remember that for the row here we specified
107

107

00:04:50,539  -->  00:04:53,356
a fixed height, but now this content here
108

108

00:04:53,356  -->  00:04:56,873
is actually overflowing that height that we defined.
109

109

00:04:56,873  -->  00:05:00,002
So, let's take a look at that.
110

110

00:05:00,002  -->  00:05:04,554
And so, here we have the header and the grid-template-rows.
111

111

00:05:04,554  -->  00:05:07,146
So, this is the first one for the logo
112

112

00:05:07,146  -->  00:05:10,720
and this is for the heading that we were talkin' about
113

113

00:05:10,720  -->  00:05:13,421
and so it's this six rem here that is overflowing.
114

114

00:05:13,421  -->  00:05:16,224
So, let's again add a minmax here
115

115

00:05:16,224  -->  00:05:20,010
and we say that it should at least be six rem, okay.
116

116

00:05:20,010  -->  00:05:22,115
And so that's for a situation where the text
117

117

00:05:22,115  -->  00:05:23,941
doesn't break into a second line,
118

118

00:05:23,941  -->  00:05:26,524
but it can also be min-content.
119

119

00:05:28,446  -->  00:05:29,279
Okay.
120

120

00:05:29,279  -->  00:05:31,028
So, in order to at least fit
121

121

00:05:31,028  -->  00:05:34,378
the content that we have in the row
122

122

00:05:34,378  -->  00:05:36,491
and so let's wait and yeah.
123

123

00:05:36,491  -->  00:05:39,324
That now fixes that issue as well.
124

124

00:05:40,486  -->  00:05:44,653
So, if we now resize this and it works just very nicely,
125

125

00:05:45,631  -->  00:05:48,685
at least for the higher view port width.
126

126

00:05:48,685  -->  00:05:50,589
For these really small screens here,
127

127

00:05:50,589  -->  00:05:53,080
we will then have to change some more stuff later
128

128

00:05:53,080  -->  00:05:54,887
with media queries, but for now
129

129

00:05:54,887  -->  00:05:58,942
it is everything is flexible here in this layout.
130

130

00:05:58,942  -->  00:06:01,066
And with that done let's now actually start
131

131

00:06:01,066  -->  00:06:02,774
with the media queries themselves
132

132

00:06:02,774  -->  00:06:04,119
and the technique I'm going to use
133

133

00:06:04,119  -->  00:06:07,435
is again the one where we resize the screen
134

134

00:06:07,435  -->  00:06:09,351
and see where the design breaks
135

135

00:06:09,351  -->  00:06:11,069
and then that will be where we
136

136

00:06:11,069  -->  00:06:14,100
will approximately set our break points.
137

137

00:06:14,100  -->  00:06:16,767
So, if we start doing that here.
138

138

00:06:17,748  -->  00:06:20,541
Then we see that here at some point probably
139

139

00:06:20,541  -->  00:06:24,409
we can start to decrease the text size, okay.
140

140

00:06:24,409  -->  00:06:28,539
So everything starts to look a bit crammed here now.
141

141

00:06:28,539  -->  00:06:30,846
So like at 1200 pixels here,
142

142

00:06:30,846  -->  00:06:33,672
so everything starts to look a bit cramped,
143

143

00:06:33,672  -->  00:06:35,779
there's not much space left here anywhere.
144

144

00:06:35,779  -->  00:06:38,895
And so let's now decrease our overall font-size
145

145

00:06:38,895  -->  00:06:40,984
just like we did on our last project
146

146

00:06:40,984  -->  00:06:44,270
and so that will buy us some more space here.
147

147

00:06:44,270  -->  00:06:48,561
So, we want to set the first media query at 1200 pixels.
148

148

00:06:48,561  -->  00:06:51,669
And so what we want to reduce is this font-size here
149

149

00:06:51,669  -->  00:06:54,208
to let's say 50%, so that instead
150

150

00:06:54,208  -->  00:06:58,745
of one rem being 10 pixels, it will be eight pixels.
151

151

00:06:58,745  -->  00:07:00,439
So, how am I going to do that?
152

152

00:07:00,439  -->  00:07:02,683
Well, just like in the last project again,
153

153

00:07:02,683  -->  00:07:05,384
I'm going to keep it simple and just create a couple
154

154

00:07:05,384  -->  00:07:07,656
of variables, each for one break point
155

155

00:07:07,656  -->  00:07:11,823
and then use these variables to write the media queries.
156

156

00:07:13,450  -->  00:07:14,450
Okay, so ...
157

157

00:07:20,797  -->  00:07:23,964
These are our responsive break points.
158

158

00:07:25,586  -->  00:07:29,955
And we're going to start with the one called largest
159

159

00:07:29,955  -->  00:07:31,653
and this one is a 1200 pixels,
160

160

00:07:31,653  -->  00:07:32,920
but remember that we shouldn't really
161

161

00:07:32,920  -->  00:07:35,566
use the media queries with pixels,
162

162

00:07:35,566  -->  00:07:38,202
but instead we are going to use em.
163

163

00:07:38,202  -->  00:07:40,035
And so, we divide 1200
164

164

00:07:41,236  -->  00:07:43,151
pixels by 16,
165

165

00:07:43,151  -->  00:07:45,981
which is the default font-size for a browser
166

166

00:07:45,981  -->  00:07:47,893
and so we end up with 75em.
167

167

00:07:47,893  -->  00:07:52,060
So, just like we did in the last project, nothing new here.
168

168

00:07:53,421  -->  00:07:56,113
And so, let's just write down that this one corresponds
169

169

00:07:56,113  -->  00:07:59,513
to 1200 pixels just to keep it in mind.
170

170

00:07:59,513  -->  00:08:00,619
Okay.
171

171

00:08:00,619  -->  00:08:03,354
So, that's done and so let's now
172

172

00:08:03,354  -->  00:08:06,021
very simply add our media query,
173

173

00:08:07,084  -->  00:08:09,407
only for the screen
174

174

00:08:09,407  -->  00:08:10,240
and ...
175

175

00:08:12,688  -->  00:08:13,771
the max-width
176

176

00:08:16,651  -->  00:08:19,197
is of course bp-largest.
177

177

00:08:19,197  -->  00:08:20,030
Okay.
178

178

00:08:20,030  -->  00:08:23,328
So, again we're going to use max-width media queries here
179

179

00:08:23,328  -->  00:08:26,874
and so we did once more a desktop first layout
180

180

00:08:26,874  -->  00:08:29,555
and that's just because I find it a lot easier
181

181

00:08:29,555  -->  00:08:31,958
to show you all these features that I showed you
182

182

00:08:31,958  -->  00:08:34,390
with CSS grid on a large screen, okay.
183

183

00:08:34,390  -->  00:08:36,577
And not on a small screen, like a phone.
184

184

00:08:36,577  -->  00:08:38,854
It would be very difficult for me to show you this stuff
185

185

00:08:38,854  -->  00:08:41,724
on a small screen like that and so instead I'm going
186

186

00:08:41,724  -->  00:08:43,608
with a desktop first layout,
187

187

00:08:43,608  -->  00:08:45,546
but if you're doing a mobile first layout
188

188

00:08:45,546  -->  00:08:47,724
then everything really works the same.
189

189

00:08:47,724  -->  00:08:50,408
So, the styles that you have outside of the media queries
190

190

00:08:50,408  -->  00:08:53,237
are for the small screen and then you start increasing from
191

191

00:08:53,237  -->  00:08:56,177
there using min-width media queries.
192

192

00:08:56,177  -->  00:08:58,744
So, just like we learned in one of the other sections
193

193

00:08:58,744  -->  00:09:01,190
of the course and if you didn't actually watch that,
194

194

00:09:01,190  -->  00:09:04,222
so maybe if you jumped right into this part of the course,
195

195

00:09:04,222  -->  00:09:06,017
then if you are not familiar with that
196

196

00:09:06,017  -->  00:09:08,894
then please just check out I think it's section six
197

197

00:09:08,894  -->  00:09:12,323
of the course where you're going to learn all about that.
198

198

00:09:12,323  -->  00:09:14,955
But anyway, let's now move on here
199

199

00:09:14,955  -->  00:09:18,955
and what we want to do is to as I said before
200

200

00:09:18,955  -->  00:09:21,848
reduce the font-size to 50%
201

201

00:09:21,848  -->  00:09:24,040
and again if you jumped to this part of the course
202

202

00:09:24,040  -->  00:09:26,366
without taking the other parts of the course
203

203

00:09:26,366  -->  00:09:28,350
then maybe this doesn't make much sense.
204

204

00:09:28,350  -->  00:09:31,388
So just to recap, this over font-size here
205

205

00:09:31,388  -->  00:09:34,213
is just so that one rem is 10 pixels.
206

206

00:09:34,213  -->  00:09:36,425
So, that we can then use rem throughout all
207

207

00:09:36,425  -->  00:09:39,545
our designs knowing that one rem is 10 pixels
208

208

00:09:39,545  -->  00:09:41,773
and the great thing about that is that we can
209

209

00:09:41,773  -->  00:09:44,403
then automatically reduce our entire layout
210

210

00:09:44,403  -->  00:09:46,962
simply by changing this font-size.
211

211

00:09:46,962  -->  00:09:49,126
And that's exactly what we did down here.
212

212

00:09:49,126  -->  00:09:53,632
So, below a 1200 pixels our font-size changes to 50%
213

213

00:09:53,632  -->  00:09:57,225
and then all of a sudden one rem becomes eight pixel
214

214

00:09:57,225  -->  00:09:58,393
and then everything changes,
215

215

00:09:58,393  -->  00:10:01,207
so everything becomes a bit smaller. Right?
216

216

00:10:01,207  -->  00:10:04,686
So, let's check that out and already you saw
217

217

00:10:04,686  -->  00:10:07,163
that it took effect here, I hope.
218

218

00:10:07,163  -->  00:10:08,008
Okay.
219

219

00:10:08,008  -->  00:10:12,625
So, that's the initial version and then a 1200, bam.
220

220

00:10:12,625  -->  00:10:15,286
See everything got a lot smaller.
221

221

00:10:15,286  -->  00:10:19,425
So, that's the first media query that was a very simple one
222

222

00:10:19,425  -->  00:10:22,310
just to give us some more space here and some of that we can
223

223

00:10:22,310  -->  00:10:26,227
then set the next media query a bit more below.
224

224

00:10:27,535  -->  00:10:30,368
Okay, so let's move on here a bit.
225

225

00:10:32,421  -->  00:10:34,612
And yeah, so you see that already this here happens
226

226

00:10:34,612  -->  00:10:37,945
so we change to a two color layout here.
227

227

00:10:38,924  -->  00:10:42,442
So, let's go up a little bit again.
228

228

00:10:42,442  -->  00:10:44,231
For example here at a thousand pixels
229

229

00:10:44,231  -->  00:10:48,120
and everything still looks good at this point, right?
230

230

00:10:48,120  -->  00:10:51,942
So, no problems anywhere to be found here.
231

231

00:10:51,942  -->  00:10:53,721
Now if we reduce this even more,
232

232

00:10:53,721  -->  00:10:55,138
let's say to 900,
233

233

00:10:56,313  -->  00:10:57,563
just like this.
234

234

00:10:59,529  -->  00:11:03,784
Well then it's starting to look not so good anymore.
235

235

00:11:03,784  -->  00:11:06,162
So, I think that, for example here,
236

236

00:11:06,162  -->  00:11:08,126
there's not enough space at all
237

237

00:11:08,126  -->  00:11:10,886
and overall I think that this sidebar here
238

238

00:11:10,886  -->  00:11:14,103
is no longer really at the right place here, okay.
239

239

00:11:14,103  -->  00:11:17,071
So, for a smaller layout it doesn't really make much sense
240

240

00:11:17,071  -->  00:11:20,742
to occupy this many space just for this sidebar here,
241

241

00:11:20,742  -->  00:11:23,379
which doesn't have much function anyway.
242

242

00:11:23,379  -->  00:11:26,536
And so here at a 1000 pixels
243

243

00:11:26,536  -->  00:11:28,921
that is when I'm going to change that.
244

244

00:11:28,921  -->  00:11:32,706
So let's take this sidebar and simply put it up here
245

245

00:11:32,706  -->  00:11:34,236
and what that means is that we actually
246

246

00:11:34,236  -->  00:11:36,285
have to change our grid definition
247

247

00:11:36,285  -->  00:11:39,067
and that's something where CSS grid is really strong.
248

248

00:11:39,067  -->  00:11:41,647
So, with a simple media query we can completely
249

249

00:11:41,647  -->  00:11:44,148
change our entire layout simply by
250

250

00:11:44,148  -->  00:11:46,540
changing our grid definitions, okay.
251

251

00:11:46,540  -->  00:11:50,149
So, all we have to do is to now add a new row to this grid
252

252

00:11:50,149  -->  00:11:53,034
and remove this first column, okay.
253

253

00:11:53,034  -->  00:11:57,210
And so that's what we're going to do now.
254

254

00:11:57,210  -->  00:12:01,389
But first we need to of course add a new break point
255

255

00:12:01,389  -->  00:12:02,222
and so,
256

256

00:12:03,405  -->  00:12:06,019
let's divide a thousand by 16,
257

257

00:12:06,019  -->  00:12:08,519
which gives us 62.5 rem, okay,
258

258

00:12:09,563  -->  00:12:10,396
so ...
259

259

00:12:12,100  -->  00:12:14,350
This one is called bp-large
260

260

00:12:15,606  -->  00:12:18,273
at 62.5em
261

261

00:12:21,658  -->  00:12:25,527
just noting down that this is a thousand pixels.
262

262

00:12:25,527  -->  00:12:28,360
So, let's just copy this one here.
263

263

00:12:29,625  -->  00:12:30,875
Come down here.
264

264

00:12:34,564  -->  00:12:35,694
And okay.
265

265

00:12:35,694  -->  00:12:37,694
So, now let's copy this.
266

266

00:12:39,565  -->  00:12:41,589
So our entire grid definition.
267

267

00:12:41,589  -->  00:12:45,191
So, as I was saying we have to just add a new row
268

268

00:12:45,191  -->  00:12:47,603
and remove the first column.
269

269

00:12:47,603  -->  00:12:51,796
So, the first column is this one here, this eight rem
270

270

00:12:51,796  -->  00:12:55,058
and also this line name here and so now our layout is going
271

271

00:12:55,058  -->  00:12:57,821
to start here at the full-start grid line
272

272

00:12:57,821  -->  00:13:01,786
and for the row I'm just going to add a new one at the top
273

273

00:13:01,786  -->  00:13:05,029
with 60 pixels high, well actually no longer 60 pixels,
274

274

00:13:05,029  -->  00:13:07,696
but six times eight so 48 pixels
275

275

00:13:08,662  -->  00:13:12,960
because remember one rem is now 8 pixels at this grid width.
276

276

00:13:12,960  -->  00:13:15,862
So, that is the grid definition, but then we also have
277

277

00:13:15,862  -->  00:13:19,633
to place the sidebar in the right place, right?
278

278

00:13:19,633  -->  00:13:23,463
So, let's open it up and now this grid-row here
279

279

00:13:23,463  -->  00:13:26,441
is no longer correct and neither is the grid-column.
280

280

00:13:26,441  -->  00:13:28,857
So, let's add a media query here as well
281

281

00:13:28,857  -->  00:13:32,690
and we're gonna take this one here and copy it
282

282

00:13:33,693  -->  00:13:35,484
because I'm kind of lazy and don't want to like
283

283

00:13:35,484  -->  00:13:37,469
to write the same code over and over again
284

284

00:13:37,469  -->  00:13:39,453
so I'm just copying it.
285

285

00:13:39,453  -->  00:13:41,355
So, the grid-column is now no longer
286

286

00:13:41,355  -->  00:13:44,438
sidebar-start sidebar-end but instead
287

287

00:13:45,670  -->  00:13:49,837
we can actually say that it's from the first to the last.
288

288

00:13:51,685  -->  00:13:54,935
So, very simple and as for the grid-row
289

289

00:13:57,790  -->  00:14:00,618
it is from line number one
290

290

00:14:00,618  -->  00:14:03,835
to line number two and that's actually it.
291

291

00:14:03,835  -->  00:14:08,002
So, let's take a look at that and alright here we go.
292

292

00:14:08,887  -->  00:14:11,157
So, the sidebar is now at the top
293

293

00:14:11,157  -->  00:14:13,185
so it's no longer really a sidebar,
294

294

00:14:13,185  -->  00:14:15,734
but anyway it's now at the top here
295

295

00:14:15,734  -->  00:14:18,387
and our design no longer has this bar here on the side
296

296

00:14:18,387  -->  00:14:20,615
and it goes all the way from the left side of the screen
297

297

00:14:20,615  -->  00:14:22,032
to the right side
298

298

00:14:22,912  -->  00:14:25,403
and let's actually see if that changes, yeah.
299

299

00:14:25,403  -->  00:14:27,769
So, it's just below a thousand pixels
300

300

00:14:27,769  -->  00:14:30,745
where it moves up there, right?
301

301

00:14:30,745  -->  00:14:32,861
Now just imagine the nightmare it would have been
302

302

00:14:32,861  -->  00:14:35,968
if we didn't name our column lines.
303

303

00:14:35,968  -->  00:14:39,717
So, if we didn't have all of these column lines
304

304

00:14:39,717  -->  00:14:43,057
and instead would have placed items with line-numbers.
305

305

00:14:43,057  -->  00:14:45,806
So, now all of these numbers would be completely different
306

306

00:14:45,806  -->  00:14:48,149
because we took out the first column
307

307

00:14:48,149  -->  00:14:50,865
and so we would have to rewrite all the code
308

308

00:14:50,865  -->  00:14:54,105
to place all of the items on our grid, right?
309

309

00:14:54,105  -->  00:14:55,996
And that would be a terrible experience.
310

310

00:14:55,996  -->  00:14:59,358
And so that's why it's so great to have the possibility
311

311

00:14:59,358  -->  00:15:02,307
of naming the grid-lines like this, right?
312

312

00:15:02,307  -->  00:15:05,106
So, again when you have a huge layout like this one,
313

313

00:15:05,106  -->  00:15:07,838
which you also want to change with media queries later one,
314

314

00:15:07,838  -->  00:15:10,984
then please always name your columns.
315

315

00:15:10,984  -->  00:15:12,557
It's always the best thing to do
316

316

00:15:12,557  -->  00:15:15,746
and if you need to place elements on the rows
317

317

00:15:15,746  -->  00:15:17,588
then also name the rows.
318

318

00:15:17,588  -->  00:15:19,633
In this case, we didn't do that
319

319

00:15:19,633  -->  00:15:23,188
because basically our mark up follows the logical structure
320

320

00:15:23,188  -->  00:15:26,565
and so the auto-placement algorithm places them
321

321

00:15:26,565  -->  00:15:28,634
just where we want them to be.
322

322

00:15:28,634  -->  00:15:31,049
Now, just one small thing that's not right here
323

323

00:15:31,049  -->  00:15:35,954
is that this icon I actually want it here to the right side.
324

324

00:15:35,954  -->  00:15:38,509
So, let's very quickly change that as well
325

325

00:15:38,509  -->  00:15:42,334
and so we need to say justify-content flex-end
326

326

00:15:42,334  -->  00:15:45,535
because remember we did this using flex-box
327

327

00:15:45,535  -->  00:15:49,882
and then also say align-items set to center.
328

328

00:15:49,882  -->  00:15:54,236
So, vertically center the icon inside of the sidebar.
329

329

00:15:54,236  -->  00:15:55,069
Okay.
330

330

00:15:56,064  -->  00:16:00,231
Now, we also need to change some stuff here in this
331

331

00:16:02,225  -->  00:16:04,497
and that's because we have this margin here,
332

332

00:16:04,497  -->  00:16:06,414
but we don't want that.
333

333

00:16:08,267  -->  00:16:09,850
For margin-top zero
334

334

00:16:11,501  -->  00:16:13,990
and so yeah that looks better.
335

335

00:16:13,990  -->  00:16:18,157
Instead we actually want the margin on the right side.
336

336

00:16:19,243  -->  00:16:21,660
So, let's say like three rem.
337

337

00:16:24,406  -->  00:16:25,456
And okay.
338

338

00:16:25,456  -->  00:16:27,316
So, that looks a lot better.
339

339

00:16:27,316  -->  00:16:29,165
Now, we can maybe just decrease here
340

340

00:16:29,165  -->  00:16:31,582
the space that we have there.
341

341

00:16:34,083  -->  00:16:37,333
So, let's just quickly do that as well.
342

342

00:16:38,861  -->  00:16:42,444
Let's say this one to two and this to zero.
343

343

00:16:43,611  -->  00:16:44,444
Okay.
344

344

00:16:44,444  -->  00:16:46,470
So, that looks more natural again.
345

345

00:16:46,470  -->  00:16:50,648
Alright, so I think that is enough for now.
346

346

00:16:50,648  -->  00:16:54,576
So, I think we are good now for a long time here actually,
347

347

00:16:54,576  -->  00:16:57,743
so at least here until this 800 pixels
348

348

00:16:58,794  -->  00:17:01,508
where it starts to look a bit weird in here, but we're going
349

349

00:17:01,508  -->  00:17:04,136
to take care of that right in the next lecture
350

350

00:17:04,136  -->  00:17:08,303
so that we don't end up with like a 30 minute video here.
