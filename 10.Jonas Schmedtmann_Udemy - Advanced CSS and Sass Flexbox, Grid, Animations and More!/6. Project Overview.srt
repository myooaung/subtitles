00:00:01,254  -->  00:00:05,065
<v Host>So, welcome to our 2nd project in this course.</v>
2

2

00:00:05,065  -->  00:00:09,694
And without further ado, let me actually show it to you.
3

3

00:00:09,694  -->  00:00:13,408
And so here it is, this project is called trillo and
4

4

00:00:13,408  -->  00:00:16,462
it is a fictional all in one booking app.
5

5

00:00:16,462  -->  00:00:17,295
Okay?
6

6

00:00:17,295  -->  00:00:20,934
So, the idea is that a user can book a hotel, a flight,
7

7

00:00:20,934  -->  00:00:24,101
a car, and a tour all in one platform.
8

8

00:00:25,410  -->  00:00:28,457
Now, of course we are not going to build this app itself,
9

9

00:00:28,457  -->  00:00:31,298
so in all functionality, but we're going to code this
10

10

00:00:31,298  -->  00:00:32,617
user interface here.
11

11

00:00:32,617  -->  00:00:35,556
So all of this app that you see here.
12

12

00:00:35,556  -->  00:00:37,485
So here in this navigation you can see that we're
13

13

00:00:37,485  -->  00:00:40,302
right now browsing the hotel section and so here
14

14

00:00:40,302  -->  00:00:43,390
on this side, you have a hotel overview.
15

15

00:00:43,390  -->  00:00:45,387
So, some pictures, then the name.
16

16

00:00:45,387  -->  00:00:46,543
Some stars here.
17

17

00:00:46,543  -->  00:00:49,453
And then an overview where you have a list
18

18

00:00:49,453  -->  00:00:51,302
with a couple of features.
19

19

00:00:51,302  -->  00:00:55,383
And then here on the right side, you have some reviews.
20

20

00:00:55,383  -->  00:00:56,216
Okay?
21

21

00:00:56,216  -->  00:00:59,123
Then, down here we have a section where we can book and
22

22

00:00:59,123  -->  00:01:03,170
then you have this nice hover effect on this button, okay?
23

23

00:01:03,170  -->  00:01:05,600
And here you probably already saw here on the navigation,
24

24

00:01:05,600  -->  00:01:09,616
we also have this nice hover effect going on, so this
25

25

00:01:09,616  -->  00:01:12,211
one here, and the here at the top
26

26

00:01:12,211  -->  00:01:15,556
we have like this header bar where you have the logo,
27

27

00:01:15,556  -->  00:01:18,262
then the search bar, and then basically here are
28

28

00:01:18,262  -->  00:01:22,249
bookmarks, some chat, and the name of the user.
29

29

00:01:22,249  -->  00:01:24,070
So, that is our project.
30

30

00:01:24,070  -->  00:01:27,269
So, the main focus of course is on flexbox here.
31

31

00:01:27,269  -->  00:01:29,478
But, you're also gonna learn a couple of new stuff,
32

32

00:01:29,478  -->  00:01:32,770
like doing this cool animations here and how to use
33

33

00:01:32,770  -->  00:01:35,667
these icons because these are actually SPG icons and that's
34

34

00:01:35,667  -->  00:01:38,102
something really cool and so I'm gonna show you
35

35

00:01:38,102  -->  00:01:39,188
how to use these.
36

36

00:01:39,188  -->  00:01:41,759
And so in general, you're gonna learn flexbox, but
37

37

00:01:41,759  -->  00:01:45,010
also a couple of other techniques that I'm gonna show you.
38

38

00:01:45,010  -->  00:01:48,248
And once again, I tried to make this a really beautiful,
39

39

00:01:48,248  -->  00:01:50,912
really modern looking app, so that you not only learn
40

40

00:01:50,912  -->  00:01:53,633
how to code and not only learn flexbox, but so that you
41

41

00:01:53,633  -->  00:01:56,570
also get some inspiration for building a beautiful
42

42

00:01:56,570  -->  00:01:59,902
web app and also that you have some nice thing to show
43

43

00:01:59,902  -->  00:02:01,643
off after this course.
44

44

00:02:01,643  -->  00:02:05,057
And so I hope that you really like the look of this app
45

45

00:02:05,057  -->  00:02:06,323
of this interface.
46

46

00:02:06,323  -->  00:02:08,143
I know that I really like it.
47

47

00:02:08,143  -->  00:02:10,334
Okay, I've put a lot of work in this so that you can
48

48

00:02:10,334  -->  00:02:12,998
be proud of your work by the end of the project.
49

49

00:02:12,998  -->  00:02:16,086
So, all we need in order to get started with this project
50

50

00:02:16,086  -->  00:02:18,888
is our starter files that you can download from the course
51

51

00:02:18,888  -->  00:02:20,343
if you didn't already.
52

52

00:02:20,343  -->  00:02:22,657
And then just open up that starter files
53

53

00:02:22,657  -->  00:02:24,150
in your code editor.
54

54

00:02:24,150  -->  00:02:27,740
So, I already have the starter files here on my desk top.
55

55

00:02:27,740  -->  00:02:31,907
Okay, so this folder and I also have it opened up already
56

56

00:02:33,142  -->  00:02:34,059
in vs code.
57

57

00:02:35,098  -->  00:02:35,931
Okay?
58

58

00:02:35,931  -->  00:02:36,764
And so, here it is.
59

59

00:02:36,764  -->  00:02:39,465
So that is the bare bones, html structure just like
60

60

00:02:39,465  -->  00:02:42,483
we hade in our previous project where all we have is
61

61

00:02:42,483  -->  00:02:43,422
the title here.
62

62

00:02:43,422  -->  00:02:47,339
So trillo, your all in one booking app and then the font
63

63

00:02:47,339  -->  00:02:50,644
which this time is open sans here and then the style
64

64

00:02:50,644  -->  00:02:52,563
which is already included in here.
65

65

00:02:52,563  -->  00:02:55,553
Now what we also have is a sass folder because once
66

66

00:02:55,553  -->  00:02:58,097
again we are going to use sass here.
67

67

00:02:58,097  -->  00:02:58,930
Okay?
68

68

00:02:58,930  -->  00:03:01,795
And then an empty sass file where all we have is these
69

69

00:03:01,795  -->  00:03:03,346
color definitions here.
70

70

00:03:03,346  -->  00:03:06,419
So, what I also have here is of course images.
71

71

00:03:06,419  -->  00:03:08,855
So that's the one we're gonna use.
72

72

00:03:08,855  -->  00:03:12,174
The css, but this is still empty because we're going to
73

73

00:03:12,174  -->  00:03:15,072
then compile our sass file and so that one is still empty.
74

74

00:03:15,072  -->  00:03:18,212
Then, I also have this package jason file from
75

75

00:03:18,212  -->  00:03:19,069
our last project
76

76

00:03:19,069  -->  00:03:21,000
And so that's actually now start
77

77

00:03:21,000  -->  00:03:23,557
by changing this one here.
78

78

00:03:23,557  -->  00:03:24,390
Okay.
79

79

00:03:24,390  -->  00:03:27,104
And to adapt it to our needs for this project.
80

80

00:03:27,104  -->  00:03:29,552
Because I don't want to write all of these scripts here
81

81

00:03:29,552  -->  00:03:32,259
over again and so I just copy this file and so we
82

82

00:03:32,259  -->  00:03:34,449
can use it here in this project as well because
83

83

00:03:34,449  -->  00:03:36,582
it's actually really the same thing.
84

84

00:03:36,582  -->  00:03:37,767
Okay.
85

85

00:03:37,767  -->  00:03:41,697
So again, we have a main.scss file which is going
86

86

00:03:41,697  -->  00:03:44,217
to compile to style.css.
87

87

00:03:44,217  -->  00:03:48,456
We want our devserver here and we want the watch css
88

88

00:03:48,456  -->  00:03:50,744
to run together with devserver.
89

89

00:03:50,744  -->  00:03:52,849
And so we have the start script here, right?
90

90

00:03:52,849  -->  00:03:54,101
Remember that one?
91

91

00:03:54,101  -->  00:03:56,452
So that is our development set up.
92

92

00:03:56,452  -->  00:03:59,078
And then down here we also have the build process which
93

93

00:03:59,078  -->  00:04:01,118
in fact is also exactly the same.
94

94

00:04:01,118  -->  00:04:03,704
And well actually it's not because we don't have the
95

95

00:04:03,704  -->  00:04:04,940
icon fonts here.
96

96

00:04:04,940  -->  00:04:05,773
Okay.
97

97

00:04:05,773  -->  00:04:08,367
So, there's not really anything to concatenate,
98

98

00:04:08,367  -->  00:04:10,896
so let's take this one out and then the input
99

99

00:04:10,896  -->  00:04:13,479
to this one here is style comp.
100

100

00:04:15,214  -->  00:04:16,224
Right?
101

101

00:04:16,224  -->  00:04:18,509
So this build process here is a bit smaller than
102

102

00:04:18,509  -->  00:04:20,209
the one in the previous project.
103

103

00:04:20,209  -->  00:04:22,414
So, we're gonna compile the sass code here,
104

104

00:04:22,414  -->  00:04:25,758
then prefix it here, then compress, and yeah.
105

105

00:04:25,758  -->  00:04:28,758
So our build process is these 3.
106

106

00:04:30,055  -->  00:04:32,201
So the concat has to go of course.
107

107

00:04:32,201  -->  00:04:34,895
So compile, prefix, and then compress.
108

108

00:04:34,895  -->  00:04:35,728
Okay?
109

109

00:04:35,728  -->  00:04:37,655
But, we're gonna talk about this later because we're
110

110

00:04:37,655  -->  00:04:39,681
only gonna use this build process in the end
111

111

00:04:39,681  -->  00:04:40,514
of this project.
112

112

00:04:40,514  -->  00:04:42,030
Okay?
113

113

00:04:42,030  -->  00:04:45,049
Okay, so this is also different.
114

114

00:04:45,049  -->  00:04:48,716
So, let's just say that it's the trillo app.
115

115

00:04:49,754  -->  00:04:52,337
Okay, it doesn't really matter.
116

116

00:04:53,401  -->  00:04:54,234
Okay.
117

117

00:04:54,234  -->  00:04:56,815
So let's actually open up the console here.
118

118

00:04:56,815  -->  00:04:59,982
And here I'm just gonna write trillo.
119

119

00:04:59,982  -->  00:05:02,458
Just to see if everything's working, okay.
120

120

00:05:02,458  -->  00:05:03,291
And so.
121

121

00:05:04,905  -->  00:05:06,415
The terminal.
122

122

00:05:06,415  -->  00:05:08,998
So, let me see what we have here.
123

123

00:05:08,998  -->  00:05:12,697
And so, in my case I have to navigate to the desk top.
124

124

00:05:12,697  -->  00:05:13,935
And trillo.
125

125

00:05:13,935  -->  00:05:15,716
And so now this is my project folder.
126

126

00:05:15,716  -->  00:05:19,429
Just to make sure, it has the css, mg, and sass folders,
127

127

00:05:19,429  -->  00:05:21,728
and then index and package.jason.
128

128

00:05:21,728  -->  00:05:22,561
Okay?
129

129

00:05:22,561  -->  00:05:23,701
So, please do the same.
130

130

00:05:23,701  -->  00:05:26,435
Navigate to your project folder just like I did.
131

131

00:05:26,435  -->  00:05:29,435
And then we can run npm, run, start.
132

132

00:05:31,071  -->  00:05:33,764
Just like we did with our previous project.
133

133

00:05:33,764  -->  00:05:36,035
And something's not working and of course it's
134

134

00:05:36,035  -->  00:05:39,327
not working because we actually have to first, install
135

135

00:05:39,327  -->  00:05:40,910
our packages, okay?
136

136

00:05:41,749  -->  00:05:43,814
And now remember what I told you in one of the
137

137

00:05:43,814  -->  00:05:46,983
first lectures where we talked about npm.
138

138

00:05:46,983  -->  00:05:49,921
So back then, I told you that usually we only copy
139

139

00:05:49,921  -->  00:05:52,289
the package.jason file, but we don't copy
140

140

00:05:52,289  -->  00:05:54,830
the node sass folder which is that folder which
141

141

00:05:54,830  -->  00:05:57,687
contains all of these packages here.
142

142

00:05:57,687  -->  00:05:58,695
Right?
143

143

00:05:58,695  -->  00:06:00,693
So, we never copy that folder and share it.
144

144

00:06:00,693  -->  00:06:04,569
Instead, we just install all the packages over again.
145

145

00:06:04,569  -->  00:06:05,819
So, we say npm.
146

146

00:06:07,098  -->  00:06:07,931
Install.
147

147

00:06:09,409  -->  00:06:12,034
And so, now it gets all of these packages and installs
148

148

00:06:12,034  -->  00:06:15,217
them in a new node modules folder.
149

149

00:06:15,217  -->  00:06:16,236
Okay.
150

150

00:06:16,236  -->  00:06:17,069
Clear.
151

151

00:06:17,069  -->  00:06:18,930
Now we can write a command again.
152

152

00:06:18,930  -->  00:06:19,936
So, npm.
153

153

00:06:19,936  -->  00:06:20,769
Run.
154

154

00:06:20,769  -->  00:06:22,274
Start.
155

155

00:06:22,274  -->  00:06:23,473
And yeah, here we go.
156

156

00:06:23,473  -->  00:06:25,008
So now, it's really working.
157

157

00:06:25,008  -->  00:06:25,841
Right?
158

158

00:06:25,841  -->  00:06:29,258
Let's just do some css here or some sass.
159

159

00:06:32,529  -->  00:06:34,202
Like our global reset.
160

160

00:06:34,202  -->  00:06:36,869
We can say, margin 0, padding 0.
161

161

00:06:40,215  -->  00:06:44,382
And then we can also say and just to test, background color.
162

162

00:06:48,522  -->  00:06:50,903
And then set it to this background color, okay.
163

163

00:06:50,903  -->  00:06:54,736
Just to see if our sass is working fine, okay.
164

164

00:06:57,037  -->  00:06:59,036
Okay, so it reloaded the page and
165

165

00:06:59,036  -->  00:07:00,615
it compiled our sass code.
166

166

00:07:00,615  -->  00:07:03,238
And so everything is working and so we're now ready
167

167

00:07:03,238  -->  00:07:05,675
to actually start building the project.
168

168

00:07:05,675  -->  00:07:09,842
So, let's do exactly that, right in the next lecture.
