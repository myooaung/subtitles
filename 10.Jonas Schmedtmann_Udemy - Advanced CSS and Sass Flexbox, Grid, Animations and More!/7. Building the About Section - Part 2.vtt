00:00:01.202  -->  00:00:03.888
<v Instructor>So welcome back after taking a break.</v>
2

2

00:00:03.888  -->  00:00:06.936
Let's now continue Building the About Section.
3

3

00:00:06.936  -->  00:00:10.867
This was where we took off after the last lecture.
4

4

00:00:10.867  -->  00:00:14.368
What we have here again, is these two headings,
5

5

00:00:14.368  -->  00:00:16.621
and I'm gonna call them tertiary headings,
6

6

00:00:16.621  -->  00:00:18.773
so the third level of a heading,
7

7

00:00:18.773  -->  00:00:21.135
which means H3 in practice.
8

8

00:00:21.135  -->  00:00:24.028
Then this here is just going to be some paragraph.
9

9

00:00:24.028  -->  00:00:24.962
Okay?
10

10

00:00:24.962  -->  00:00:26.685
So just some very simple styles
11

11

00:00:26.685  -->  00:00:30.141
so let's now very quickly implement them.
12

12

00:00:30.141  -->  00:00:34.689
But once again before we start with our markup here.
13

13

00:00:34.689  -->  00:00:36.675
So we're inside of this column here,
14

14

00:00:36.675  -->  00:00:38.143
so we can actually right now
15

15

00:00:38.143  -->  00:00:40.713
start writing our H3 here.
16

16

00:00:40.713  -->  00:00:42.516
Again, I'm going to use Emmet,
17

17

00:00:42.516  -->  00:00:45.119
and I hope that you're already using it as well.
18

18

00:00:45.119  -->  00:00:46.952
So H3 and now heading-
19

19

00:00:49.578  -->  00:00:50.411
tertiary.
20

20

00:00:52.977  -->  00:00:54.665
And the text goes like
21

21

00:00:54.665  -->  00:00:58.082
You're going to fall in love with nature.
22

22

00:01:00.571  -->  00:01:04.267
Then after that, we have a paragraph element,
23

23

00:01:04.267  -->  00:01:07.267
we just simply gonna call paragraph.
24

24

00:01:09.043  -->  00:01:11.483
So hit Tab and then some text here.
25

25

00:01:11.483  -->  00:01:12.417
Okay.
26

26

00:01:12.417  -->  00:01:14.656
Now, if you're using Emmet already,
27

27

00:01:14.656  -->  00:01:19.124
then you can simply write Lorem to get some blind text.
28

28

00:01:19.124  -->  00:01:22.213
So some text that is just like a filler text.
29

29

00:01:22.213  -->  00:01:24.971
So we write Lorem, and then you hit Tab,
30

30

00:01:24.971  -->  00:01:28.630
and then this weird-looking text here appears
31

31

00:01:28.630  -->  00:01:30.341
like in Latin or something.
32

32

00:01:30.341  -->  00:01:33.033
We could also go to a generator like this one,
33

33

00:01:33.033  -->  00:01:34.822
Lorem Ipsum Generator,
34

34

00:01:34.822  -->  00:01:37.467
and then get some text from down here.
35

35

00:01:37.467  -->  00:01:40.068
You can even generate more paragraphs or sentences
36

36

00:01:40.068  -->  00:01:44.060
or words or whatever, so if you need some blind text,
37

37

00:01:44.060  -->  00:01:47.434
you can use a tool like that, or just use Emmet.
38

38

00:01:47.434  -->  00:01:49.350
Now it's actually not the best practice
39

39

00:01:49.350  -->  00:01:52.281
to use blind text when we build webpages.
40

40

00:01:52.281  -->  00:01:54.559
It's always best to work with the final content
41

41

00:01:54.559  -->  00:01:57.522
that's gonna be on the site, but in case we don't have that,
42

42

00:01:57.522  -->  00:01:59.432
then it's okay to just use blind text.
43

43

00:01:59.432  -->  00:02:00.265
Okay?
44

44

00:02:02.603  -->  00:02:06.418
And to know I'm copying this because we have two headers.
45

45

00:02:06.418  -->  00:02:07.884
The second one says,
46

46

00:02:07.884  -->  00:02:11.467
Live adventures like you never have before.
47

47

00:02:19.142  -->  00:02:22.155
Let me try it, and now it's no longer working.
48

48

00:02:22.155  -->  00:02:23.819
Well, why is that?
49

49

00:02:23.819  -->  00:02:27.239
It's probably because it's already written in here.
50

50

00:02:27.239  -->  00:02:29.572
Let me delete it just to ...
51

51

00:02:30.410  -->  00:02:31.996
Yeah it's true.
52

52

00:02:31.996  -->  00:02:34.486
Actually you'll see that the text that we wrote here now
53

53

00:02:34.486  -->  00:02:38.872
is a bit different than what we have here, right?
54

54

00:02:38.872  -->  00:02:41.023
It looks better on the final webpage
55

55

00:02:41.023  -->  00:02:43.624
if the text isn't exactly the same.
56

56

00:02:43.624  -->  00:02:45.900
As we were discussing in the last lecture,
57

57

00:02:45.900  -->  00:02:48.017
these are very simple styles concerning
58

58

00:02:48.017  -->  00:02:50.374
the typography of our website.
59

59

00:02:50.374  -->  00:02:52.898
We're not really calling them components or anything.
60

60

00:02:52.898  -->  00:02:55.297
They are just typography styles,
61

61

00:02:55.297  -->  00:02:57.944
and so heading-tertiary as well as paragraph
62

62

00:02:57.944  -->  00:03:01.111
are going here to our typography file.
63

63

00:03:03.759  -->  00:03:06.592
All right, and also the paragraph.
64

64

00:03:09.207  -->  00:03:12.104
Now this is not gonna be anything really fancy here.
65

65

00:03:12.104  -->  00:03:15.604
All we want to do is to set some font-size
66

66

00:03:16.655  -->  00:03:17.572
like 1.6rem
67

67

00:03:19.417  -->  00:03:22.509
and maybe a font-weight here as well.
68

68

00:03:22.509  -->  00:03:25.971
Let's say 700 so to make it a bit bolder.
69

69

00:03:25.971  -->  00:03:28.003
Then such as our other headings,
70

70

00:03:28.003  -->  00:03:31.086
let's also transform it to uppercase.
71

71

00:03:32.239  -->  00:03:33.656
So text-transform
72

72

00:03:34.562  -->  00:03:35.395
uppercase.
73

73

00:03:36.270  -->  00:03:37.451
All right.
74

74

00:03:37.451  -->  00:03:39.324
And as for the paragraph, let me set
75

75

00:03:39.324  -->  00:03:41.741
the font-size to 1.6 as well,
76

76

00:03:43.362  -->  00:03:44.195
1.6 rem.
77

77

00:03:45.843  -->  00:03:48.167
Now what I also want, I want the paragraphs
78

78

00:03:48.167  -->  00:03:50.243
to have a margin at the bottom,
79

79

00:03:50.243  -->  00:03:52.439
and that's because we usually use a bunch
80

80

00:03:52.439  -->  00:03:54.962
of different paragraphs one after the other,
81

81

00:03:54.962  -->  00:03:57.850
and so it makes sense to have a bit of space between them.
82

82

00:03:57.850  -->  00:04:01.349
But, we don't want any space between the last one.
83

83

00:04:01.349  -->  00:04:03.382
Do you remember how we did that?
84

84

00:04:03.382  -->  00:04:06.977
That's right, we used a not pseudo class again.
85

85

00:04:06.977  -->  00:04:08.477
So just like this,
86

86

00:04:09.339  -->  00:04:10.339
not and then
87

87

00:04:12.039  -->  00:04:12.956
last-child.
88

88

00:04:15.047  -->  00:04:18.503
We're selecting everything except the last child,
89

89

00:04:18.503  -->  00:04:20.209
so the opposite of last child.
90

90

00:04:20.209  -->  00:04:21.226
Last child is what?
91

91

00:04:21.226  -->  00:04:22.449
It's just the last one,
92

92

00:04:22.449  -->  00:04:27.040
but not last child is everything except the last child.
93

93

00:04:27.040  -->  00:04:28.753
Let's give it some margin
94

94

00:04:28.753  -->  00:04:31.003
at the bottom of 30 pixels,
95

95

00:04:31.994  -->  00:04:33.431
so 3rem.
96

96

00:04:33.431  -->  00:04:35.514
Let's check this out now.
97

97

00:04:38.113  -->  00:04:39.657
All right.
98

98

00:04:39.657  -->  00:04:41.607
This looks actually pretty good already.
99

99

00:04:41.607  -->  00:04:45.426
Let's just take a look and actually, so yeah,
100

100

00:04:45.426  -->  00:04:48.197
this has the margin at the bottom,
101

101

00:04:48.197  -->  00:04:51.043
but this one does not because it's the last child,
102

102

00:04:51.043  -->  00:04:52.463
and so therefore, our rule
103

103

00:04:52.463  -->  00:04:55.679
that we applied before does work indeed.
104

104

00:04:55.679  -->  00:04:57.996
Now one last thing we can do here with this text
105

105

00:04:57.996  -->  00:05:00.683
is to set some margin in here.
106

106

00:05:00.683  -->  00:05:02.756
Now, I want you to keep in mind what we did
107

107

00:05:02.756  -->  00:05:04.426
with this heading here.
108

108

00:05:04.426  -->  00:05:05.769
We used the helper class
109

109

00:05:05.769  -->  00:05:08.414
to set this margin that you see here.
110

110

00:05:08.414  -->  00:05:10.526
Remember this 80 pixels, this 8rem here.
111

111

00:05:10.526  -->  00:05:11.625
Right?
112

112

00:05:11.625  -->  00:05:13.023
That's because of reuseability.
113

113

00:05:13.023  -->  00:05:15.424
We want to reuse this throughout the page.
114

114

00:05:15.424  -->  00:05:17.134
The same thing might be true
115

115

00:05:17.134  -->  00:05:19.574
for this H3 element here of course.
116

116

00:05:19.574  -->  00:05:23.111
Let's now do the exact same thing.
117

117

00:05:23.111  -->  00:05:24.495
We want to reuse it,
118

118

00:05:24.495  -->  00:05:27.707
and so we're simply going to add a utility class
119

119

00:05:27.707  -->  00:05:30.715
because we might want some of these headings with space
120

120

00:05:30.715  -->  00:05:32.385
but others without space,
121

121

00:05:32.385  -->  00:05:36.127
and so the utility class is the way to go here.
122

122

00:05:36.127  -->  00:05:37.309
Sorry.
123

123

00:05:37.309  -->  00:05:39.340
I didn't intend to just delete that.
124

124

00:05:39.340  -->  00:05:41.936
We want to add it here as well as here, right?
125

125

00:05:41.936  -->  00:05:44.255
So I can use the trick that I showed you earlier
126

126

00:05:44.255  -->  00:05:46.575
with the multiple cursors.
127

127

00:05:46.575  -->  00:05:50.927
Here and now I hit command or control probably on Windows,
128

128

00:05:50.927  -->  00:05:52.473
and now I have two cursors,
129

129

00:05:52.473  -->  00:05:55.898
and I can write the same thing in two places.
130

130

00:05:55.898  -->  00:05:56.731
So u-
131

131

00:05:57.711  -->  00:05:58.878
margin-bottom-
132

132

00:06:00.524  -->  00:06:03.815
2, so I'm going with 20 pixels here.
133

133

00:06:03.815  -->  00:06:06.096
You know what would be actually better here
134

134

00:06:06.096  -->  00:06:07.765
instead of having these numbers,
135

135

00:06:07.765  -->  00:06:09.435
it would be having some designation,
136

136

00:06:09.435  -->  00:06:11.269
so some names because right now,
137

137

00:06:11.269  -->  00:06:14.077
we're actually hard coding the margin in here,
138

138

00:06:14.077  -->  00:06:16.148
so this would basically be the same as having
139

139

00:06:16.148  -->  00:06:18.957
an inline style and set the margin directly in here.
140

140

00:06:18.957  -->  00:06:20.179
Right?
141

141

00:06:20.179  -->  00:06:22.559
So what's really the point of having it like this here
142

142

00:06:22.559  -->  00:06:25.326
with this name already saying that it's two
143

143

00:06:25.326  -->  00:06:28.581
if it could just set the inline style tool to rem.
144

144

00:06:28.581  -->  00:06:29.636
All right.
145

145

00:06:29.636  -->  00:06:32.296
So let me just delete this here and call it small,
146

146

00:06:32.296  -->  00:06:34.941
and in here, call it big.
147

147

00:06:34.941  -->  00:06:35.774
Okay.
148

148

00:06:37.263  -->  00:06:41.747
So, this one is big, and now we want one that is small,
149

149

00:06:41.747  -->  00:06:45.407
and maybe even one that is called medium or something.
150

150

00:06:45.407  -->  00:06:48.990
So small, and one called medium, let's say.
151

151

00:06:52.769  -->  00:06:55.082
Let's make it 2, and this one 4.
152

152

00:06:55.082  -->  00:06:58.132
Maybe we can use it later at some point.
153

153

00:06:58.132  -->  00:07:00.329
Now it makes sense to have the utility classes
154

154

00:07:00.329  -->  00:07:03.177
like that because then if we later want to change,
155

155

00:07:03.177  -->  00:07:06.436
this margin bottom actually to like four or 1.5
156

156

00:07:06.436  -->  00:07:09.284
or something like that, then the names still make sense
157

157

00:07:09.284  -->  00:07:11.029
that we have here in our markup.
158

158

00:07:11.029  -->  00:07:11.862
Okay.
159

159

00:07:13.022  -->  00:07:16.964
So let's check it out, and yeah, okay.
160

160

00:07:16.964  -->  00:07:18.563
Actually, I think it's a bit too much,
161

161

00:07:18.563  -->  00:07:22.512
so let's change it to 1.5 and so now I imagine
162

162

00:07:22.512  -->  00:07:25.443
we would have to go back and then change it here too
163

163

00:07:25.443  -->  00:07:27.193
to what, 1.5 for 1-5.
164

164

00:07:28.330  -->  00:07:31.053
That would be weird, so it's better like this.
165

165

00:07:31.053  -->  00:07:32.886
Let's hope it updates.
166

166

00:07:33.904  -->  00:07:36.596
It did not update, well why is that?
167

167

00:07:36.596  -->  00:07:37.429
Inspect.
168

168

00:07:38.753  -->  00:07:41.808
And yeah, actually it did, okay, so 1.5rem now.
169

169

00:07:41.808  -->  00:07:43.838
Actually, since we're looking here at the rem,
170

170

00:07:43.838  -->  00:07:45.546
there's something I want to show you,
171

171

00:07:45.546  -->  00:07:47.777
so remember all the talk that we had about the way
172

172

00:07:47.777  -->  00:07:50.870
that units are processed in CSS, right?
173

173

00:07:50.870  -->  00:07:54.569
We talked about declared values and cascaded values
174

174

00:07:54.569  -->  00:07:56.973
and used values and computed values
175

175

00:07:56.973  -->  00:07:58.884
and all of that stuff, right?
176

176

00:07:58.884  -->  00:08:02.298
Actually what this dev tools here allows you to do
177

177

00:08:02.298  -->  00:08:04.695
is to see a computed values.
178

178

00:08:04.695  -->  00:08:07.867
In here we have for example, 1.5rem,
179

179

00:08:07.867  -->  00:08:10.958
and then we have all the computed values.
180

180

00:08:10.958  -->  00:08:14.005
For example, we see the 16 pixels that we have.
181

181

00:08:14.005  -->  00:08:15.955
We see that all of these are set to zero.
182

182

00:08:15.955  -->  00:08:18.290
Remember that I was telling you that all of these elements,
183

183

00:08:18.290  -->  00:08:20.769
they have to have some value, right?
184

184

00:08:20.769  -->  00:08:22.839
So the padding has a value, all of zero.
185

185

00:08:22.839  -->  00:08:25.646
The margin has values, all of zero,
186

186

00:08:25.646  -->  00:08:27.839
except this one which is 15,
187

187

00:08:27.839  -->  00:08:32.598
and then all of these properties here, they have values.
188

188

00:08:32.598  -->  00:08:34.306
If we should hit, Show all here,
189

189

00:08:34.306  -->  00:08:37.557
then we can actually see all of the CSS properties
190

190

00:08:37.557  -->  00:08:39.589
with all of their values.
191

191

00:08:39.589  -->  00:08:41.747
If you remember that lecture, this values,
192

192

00:08:41.747  -->  00:08:45.518
they are either the inherited values or the default values.
193

193

00:08:45.518  -->  00:08:46.351
Right?
194

194

00:08:49.096  -->  00:08:52.920
Okay, so we saw that we have here this 15 pixels
195

195

00:08:52.920  -->  00:08:55.920
which came exactly from this 1.5rem.
196

196

00:08:57.140  -->  00:08:59.907
So everything's working just as expected.
197

197

00:08:59.907  -->  00:09:02.800
Okay, so let's now take care
198

198

00:09:02.800  -->  00:09:04.144
of this button that we have here.
199

199

00:09:04.144  -->  00:09:05.201
Okay.
200

200

00:09:05.201  -->  00:09:07.686
I'm also now seeing that this text here is a bit smaller,
201

201

00:09:07.686  -->  00:09:10.577
and actually it looks a bit nicer that way here.
202

202

00:09:10.577  -->  00:09:13.256
All right, so that's cut a bit off the outer text,
203

203

00:09:13.256  -->  00:09:16.206
but then of course, focus on this button here.
204

204

00:09:16.206  -->  00:09:18.320
You see that when we hover the button,
205

205

00:09:18.320  -->  00:09:21.368
from the green underline, it becomes a green background,
206

206

00:09:21.368  -->  00:09:23.033
and you'll see the subtle shadow here,
207

207

00:09:23.033  -->  00:09:25.276
and then when we hit it, it goes down.
208

208

00:09:25.276  -->  00:09:28.284
This basically is the same mechanism as here.
209

209

00:09:28.284  -->  00:09:30.072
When we hit it, it goes up a little bit,
210

210

00:09:30.072  -->  00:09:31.659
and then we click it,
211

211

00:09:31.659  -->  00:09:34.221
it looks like it moves away from the user.
212

212

00:09:34.221  -->  00:09:37.313
Basically, as if we were really physically clicking
213

213

00:09:37.313  -->  00:09:42.236
the button, okay, like hitting the button with our hand.
214

214

00:09:42.236  -->  00:09:46.403
That's the same impression that I wanted to create here.
215

215

00:09:47.266  -->  00:09:48.565
Okay.
216

216

00:09:48.565  -->  00:09:52.732
As we were saying, let's take away some of this text.
217

217

00:09:53.731  -->  00:09:55.898
Well, maybe not this much.
218

218

00:09:57.951  -->  00:09:59.942
That was finished somewhere here.
219

219

00:09:59.942  -->  00:10:01.120
Okay.
220

220

00:10:01.120  -->  00:10:04.370
Yeah, looks better, maybe one more word
221

221

00:10:05.848  -->  00:10:07.265
or two, and okay.
222

222

00:10:10.243  -->  00:10:14.119
This button will be an anchor, so I'll just write
223

223

00:10:14.119  -->  00:10:15.036
a.btn-text,
224

224

00:10:18.217  -->  00:10:19.803
hit Tab, and that's it.
225

225

00:10:19.803  -->  00:10:23.750
Actually it also asks me here to complete the H ref.
226

226

00:10:23.750  -->  00:10:25.174
Okay.
227

227

00:10:25.174  -->  00:10:26.799
I just point it to nowhere,
228

228

00:10:26.799  -->  00:10:29.968
so that's why I'm using this hash symbol here.
229

229

00:10:29.968  -->  00:10:32.287
If I now hit Tab, you see that it will then come
230

230

00:10:32.287  -->  00:10:33.794
to this point here next
231

231

00:10:33.794  -->  00:10:35.988
because there's already this gray cursor here.
232

232

00:10:35.988  -->  00:10:40.751
So I hit Tab again, and now I'm here, and then I'm here.
233

233

00:10:40.751  -->  00:10:42.260
So you see this Emmet extension,
234

234

00:10:42.260  -->  00:10:44.253
it's really, really helpful.
235

235

00:10:44.253  -->  00:10:47.751
For example, if I just write img
236

236

00:10:47.751  -->  00:10:50.030
then it will automatically put these attributes
237

237

00:10:50.030  -->  00:10:52.877
here for me, and let me cycle through them.
238

238

00:10:52.877  -->  00:10:55.886
Now, I write something here, let's say abc,
239

239

00:10:55.886  -->  00:10:58.732
and if I now hit Tab, it will go to the next place
240

240

00:10:58.732  -->  00:11:00.479
where I can write some text.
241

241

00:11:00.479  -->  00:11:04.259
So text, and if I hit Tab again, it goes to the end.
242

242

00:11:04.259  -->  00:11:05.092
Okay.
243

243

00:11:06.049  -->  00:11:09.758
The text in here should be Learn more.
244

244

00:11:09.758  -->  00:11:11.429
Then we have this arrow going on,
245

245

00:11:11.429  -->  00:11:14.368
and that is a html special character
246

246

00:11:14.368  -->  00:11:17.780
or a special symbol, and in html, we write them like that.
247

247

00:11:17.780  -->  00:11:20.973
So the ampersand and then a special code,
248

248

00:11:20.973  -->  00:11:22.806
so in this case, rarr,
249

249

00:11:24.367  -->  00:11:27.373
and that will translate into this arrow.
250

250

00:11:27.373  -->  00:11:29.857
Let's take a look, and yeah, so this is the arrow
251

251

00:11:29.857  -->  00:11:31.810
that I was telling you about.
252

252

00:11:31.810  -->  00:11:33.841
Now for a complete list of these,
253

253

00:11:33.841  -->  00:11:35.788
they are actually on my resources page.
254

254

00:11:35.788  -->  00:11:38.225
I don't know if you're familiar with that one,
255

255

00:11:38.225  -->  00:11:40.546
so let me just open it to you here,
256

256

00:11:40.546  -->  00:11:43.629
codingheroes.io/resources.
257

257

00:11:47.947  -->  00:11:49.616
All right, and then,
258

258

00:11:49.616  -->  00:11:53.783
so here is this HTML Entity Reference by CSS-Tricks.
259

259

00:11:55.303  -->  00:11:58.193
In here you have all these codes
260

260

00:11:58.193  -->  00:12:00.881
for these special symbols if you want to use them.
261

261

00:12:00.881  -->  00:12:03.036
What I want to show you is this arrow,
262

262

00:12:03.036  -->  00:12:06.083
and I think it's somewhere down there.
263

263

00:12:06.083  -->  00:12:07.000
Let me see.
264

264

00:12:11.740  -->  00:12:15.236
Well we have all these Greek letters going on here.
265

265

00:12:15.236  -->  00:12:18.069
Some more Greek letters, and well,
266

266

00:12:19.217  -->  00:12:21.697
it should be somewhere here.
267

267

00:12:21.697  -->  00:12:23.407
Oh okay, so here are the arrows.
268

268

00:12:23.407  -->  00:12:26.791
I really like to use these instead of using other icons
269

269

00:12:26.791  -->  00:12:29.272
like coming from an icon font, so it's just easier
270

270

00:12:29.272  -->  00:12:31.689
to use these html code, okay.
271

271

00:12:32.927  -->  00:12:35.325
If you don't know about this resource page,
272

272

00:12:35.325  -->  00:12:38.697
I have a bunch of resources here, and I update it sometimes,
273

273

00:12:38.697  -->  00:12:41.664
and you can subscribe if you want to receive these updates,
274

274

00:12:41.664  -->  00:12:44.679
but of course, you don't have to, okay?
275

275

00:12:44.679  -->  00:12:46.512
Let's close this again,
276

276

00:12:46.512  -->  00:12:50.092
and now we are ready to style this link.
277

277

00:12:50.092  -->  00:12:54.727
We already have a file for a button component,
278

278

00:12:54.727  -->  00:12:57.901
so I say that we can simply add this new,
279

279

00:12:57.901  -->  00:12:59.688
this smaller button here
280

280

00:12:59.688  -->  00:13:03.645
to this button component file as well, okay?
281

281

00:13:03.645  -->  00:13:04.562
So btn-text
282

282

00:13:08.262  -->  00:13:10.700
and then we can put our styles here.
283

283

00:13:10.700  -->  00:13:13.708
We will have some styles for the links and visited,
284

284

00:13:13.708  -->  00:13:18.103
and of course hover and active pseudo classes.
285

285

00:13:18.103  -->  00:13:20.951
So link and by now, you're already really familiar
286

286

00:13:20.951  -->  00:13:23.632
with the way we write this.
287

287

00:13:23.632  -->  00:13:25.299
So link and visited,
288

288

00:13:27.944  -->  00:13:31.361
and then we have one for the hover state,
289

289

00:13:33.746  -->  00:13:37.246
and then we have one for the active state.
290

290

00:13:39.766  -->  00:13:42.084
This is actually pretty similar to the button
291

291

00:13:42.084  -->  00:13:46.251
that we wrote before, so let's just very quickly do this.
292

292

00:13:47.370  -->  00:13:50.502
The color should be our primary green color.
293

293

00:13:50.502  -->  00:13:51.335
Okay?
294

294

00:13:52.572  -->  00:13:57.456
So that it stands out nicely from the rest of the text.
295

295

00:13:57.456  -->  00:13:59.779
Our green color, we are going to display it
296

296

00:13:59.779  -->  00:14:02.951
as an inline block as always, so that we can use
297

297

00:14:02.951  -->  00:14:04.782
the box model properties on it
298

298

00:14:04.782  -->  00:14:07.910
like padding, margin, and all that good stuff.
299

299

00:14:07.910  -->  00:14:12.908
So inline-block, then we want to get rid of the underlining,
300

300

00:14:12.908  -->  00:14:14.408
so text-decoration
301

301

00:14:16.886  -->  00:14:20.510
none because we want to put our own decoration,
302

302

00:14:20.510  -->  00:14:22.340
so our own underlining.
303

303

00:14:22.340  -->  00:14:25.423
We do that by having a border button.
304

304

00:14:28.617  -->  00:14:29.784
It will be 1px
305

305

00:14:31.763  -->  00:14:34.596
solid and again the primary color,
306

306

00:14:36.242  -->  00:14:39.654
so the exact same color as the text,
307

307

00:14:39.654  -->  00:14:42.746
and we do that because this way, we can set a padding
308

308

00:14:42.746  -->  00:14:46.612
between the text and the line which otherwise we could not.
309

309

00:14:46.612  -->  00:14:47.445
So padding
310

310

00:14:48.385  -->  00:14:51.759
3px, and again three pixels like this
311

311

00:14:51.759  -->  00:14:54.685
and one pixel is so small that it's not really going
312

312

00:14:54.685  -->  00:14:57.046
to change sizes if the user decides
313

313

00:14:57.046  -->  00:14:58.998
to change the base font size.
314

314

00:14:58.998  -->  00:15:01.126
So if everything on the page scales up,
315

315

00:15:01.126  -->  00:15:03.731
one pixel will still be one pixel
316

316

00:15:03.731  -->  00:15:05.802
because in order to become two pixels,
317

317

00:15:05.802  -->  00:15:09.029
the user would have to change the base font size
318

318

00:15:09.029  -->  00:15:12.240
from 16 to 32, so to double it,
319

319

00:15:12.240  -->  00:15:14.150
and that's a bit extreme, so I mean
320

320

00:15:14.150  -->  00:15:16.060
no one is going to do that.
321

321

00:15:16.060  -->  00:15:18.050
The same applies here to this padding,
322

322

00:15:18.050  -->  00:15:19.759
so if it's a really small unit,
323

323

00:15:19.759  -->  00:15:21.508
we can just leave it like that.
324

324

00:15:21.508  -->  00:15:25.534
All right, and about the hover, remember how it looked like.
325

325

00:15:25.534  -->  00:15:28.014
I can actually show it to you again.
326

326

00:15:28.014  -->  00:15:30.008
While sometimes it doesn't really reload,
327

327

00:15:30.008  -->  00:15:32.528
I'm not sure why, and actually nothing's happening.
328

328

00:15:32.528  -->  00:15:34.443
Let me take a look why.
329

329

00:15:34.443  -->  00:15:37.776
So btn-text, and it's the class of this,
330

330

00:15:39.488  -->  00:15:41.319
and btn-text is what I have here
331

331

00:15:41.319  -->  00:15:42.862
so why is this not working?
332

332

00:15:42.862  -->  00:15:47.577
Oh I see, I have an error here, so a small typo.
333

333

00:15:47.577  -->  00:15:49.329
Let's save it and take a look again.
334

334

00:15:49.329  -->  00:15:51.647
Oh yeah, so here we have it.
335

335

00:15:51.647  -->  00:15:55.147
Also we forgot to style the size of this,
336

336

00:15:55.147  -->  00:15:57.829
so let's do that as well, and then remember
337

337

00:15:57.829  -->  00:16:01.280
that the hover effect is like this moves up a bit,
338

338

00:16:01.280  -->  00:16:06.083
has the shadow, and when we click, it moves down.
339

339

00:16:06.083  -->  00:16:07.666
First things first.
340

340

00:16:08.984  -->  00:16:12.484
The font-size should be like the text 1.6,
341

341

00:16:13.355  -->  00:16:16.806
and then let's take care of the hover effect.
342

342

00:16:16.806  -->  00:16:20.626
Now actually this 1.6rem font-size number here
343

343

00:16:20.626  -->  00:16:23.348
is coming up an awful lot of times,
344

344

00:16:23.348  -->  00:16:24.897
so I think it's actually best
345

345

00:16:24.897  -->  00:16:27.295
to replace this with a variable,
346

346

00:16:27.295  -->  00:16:30.105
so if one day we want to change this 16 pixel
347

347

00:16:30.105  -->  00:16:33.034
like default font-size that we have here on the page,
348

348

00:16:33.034  -->  00:16:36.733
we can simply do that by changing one variable.
349

349

00:16:36.733  -->  00:16:38.150
So let's do that.
350

350

00:16:40.188  -->  00:16:41.938
Let's say font-sizes,
351

351

00:16:43.850  -->  00:16:44.933
or just font.
352

352

00:16:45.886  -->  00:16:47.636
So default-font-size.
353

353

00:16:51.425  -->  00:16:53.418
I'm simply calling the default font-size
354

354

00:16:53.418  -->  00:16:57.001
because that's the font-size we're using all over the place.
355

355

00:16:57.001  -->  00:16:59.438
We used it in the paragraphs, in this button text,
356

356

00:16:59.438  -->  00:17:03.792
in the H3, we used it I think in a primary button as well,
357

357

00:17:03.792  -->  00:17:05.991
and so let's do a variable with that.
358

358

00:17:05.991  -->  00:17:10.951
Now please don't confuse that with, where do we have it?
359

359

00:17:10.951  -->  00:17:12.416
Well, it's not here.
360

360

00:17:12.416  -->  00:17:13.712
I know.
361

361

00:17:13.712  -->  00:17:18.440
Please don't confuse it with this 62.5%, okay.
362

362

00:17:18.440  -->  00:17:20.024
So we already talked about this.
363

363

00:17:20.024  -->  00:17:23.517
This is just a definition to define what one rem is.
364

364

00:17:23.517  -->  00:17:24.784
Right?
365

365

00:17:24.784  -->  00:17:28.360
So all we're doing here in this variables file now,
366

366

00:17:28.360  -->  00:17:32.466
is to say basically that we're using 1.6rem all the time,
367

367

00:17:32.466  -->  00:17:35.716
and so we're using a variable for that.
368

368

00:17:38.770  -->  00:17:40.937
I know that we use it here
369

369

00:17:42.024  -->  00:17:46.296
in the heading-tertiary exactly, and down there as well.
370

370

00:17:46.296  -->  00:17:48.532
So default font-size here and here.
371

371

00:17:48.532  -->  00:17:51.384
Let's save it here in the typography,
372

372

00:17:51.384  -->  00:17:53.297
and the utilities, I can close it.
373

373

00:17:53.297  -->  00:17:56.471
The main I can also close it for now.
374

374

00:17:56.471  -->  00:17:59.471
Here in the button, we also used it.
375

375

00:18:00.895  -->  00:18:03.621
If I remember it right, we did it here as well.
376

376

00:18:03.621  -->  00:18:07.788
Yeah, font-size here in the primary button is 1.6 as well.
377

377

00:18:10.622  -->  00:18:12.455
Everything is 1.6 now.
378

378

00:18:14.002  -->  00:18:15.998
That is our version.
379

379

00:18:15.998  -->  00:18:17.871
Imagine that we have a client for example,
380

380

00:18:17.871  -->  00:18:20.029
for which we are building this site.
381

381

00:18:20.029  -->  00:18:21.977
You have all your site nicely set up,
382

382

00:18:21.977  -->  00:18:24.456
and you're going to the client to show it to him.
383

383

00:18:24.456  -->  00:18:26.735
He says "Well, this text is way too small.
384

384

00:18:26.735  -->  00:18:28.238
"I want it bigger."
385

385

00:18:28.238  -->  00:18:29.539
What are you going to do?
386

386

00:18:29.539  -->  00:18:30.959
What do you prefer to do?
387

387

00:18:30.959  -->  00:18:33.222
Do you prefer to go to all of this code here
388

388

00:18:33.222  -->  00:18:36.187
and change font-size manually to 1.8 for example,
389

389

00:18:36.187  -->  00:18:40.982
1.8 all over the place, in the button, in the button,
390

390

00:18:40.982  -->  00:18:43.583
and the other typography styles that we saw,
391

391

00:18:43.583  -->  00:18:45.699
or do you prefer to simply come here
392

392

00:18:45.699  -->  00:18:49.866
and change one number to 1.8 and everything changes,
393

393

00:18:50.701  -->  00:18:53.140
and you see everything changes.
394

394

00:18:53.140  -->  00:18:56.638
The client is happy and everything is easier for you.
395

395

00:18:56.638  -->  00:18:59.322
You just saved a lot of time and the client is happy,
396

396

00:18:59.322  -->  00:19:01.150
and so everyone is happy.
397

397

00:19:01.150  -->  00:19:02.657
So you see variables.
398

398

00:19:02.657  -->  00:19:04.325
We should use them whenever we can.
399

399

00:19:04.325  -->  00:19:05.709
Okay?
400

400

00:19:05.709  -->  00:19:08.350
You can probably argue that I could use even more variables
401

401

00:19:08.350  -->  00:19:09.813
all over the place here,
402

402

00:19:09.813  -->  00:19:12.296
but I also don't want to make it too much here.
403

403

00:19:12.296  -->  00:19:13.149
Okay?
404

404

00:19:13.149  -->  00:19:15.680
I'm wanna keep it at a reasonable level.
405

405

00:19:15.680  -->  00:19:17.021
All right, anyway.
406

406

00:19:17.021  -->  00:19:19.214
Let's not change this hover style,
407

407

00:19:19.214  -->  00:19:23.144
so background color, you saw it was this green as well.
408

408

00:19:23.144  -->  00:19:25.311
So default, actually color
409

409

00:19:27.521  -->  00:19:28.354
primary.
410

410

00:19:30.000  -->  00:19:32.397
The text changed to white.
411

411

00:19:32.397  -->  00:19:33.647
So color-white.
412

412

00:19:37.036  -->  00:19:40.776
And we have some box shadow going on remember,
413

413

00:19:40.776  -->  00:19:42.938
it's zero in the X direction,
414

414

00:19:42.938  -->  00:19:46.708
10 pixels or 1rem in the Y direction.
415

415

00:19:46.708  -->  00:19:47.875
Let's put 2rem
416

416

00:19:48.891  -->  00:19:49.891
for the blur
417

417

00:19:50.872  -->  00:19:52.872
and then the color, rgba
418

418

00:19:53.771  -->  00:19:55.073
color-black
419

419

00:19:55.073  -->  00:19:59.021
and you're already used to writing this.
420

420

00:19:59.021  -->  00:20:00.931
I'm going with 15% here.
421

421

00:20:00.931  -->  00:20:03.576
Please feel free to play around with all these numbers
422

422

00:20:03.576  -->  00:20:05.733
to get a better feeling for them,
423

423

00:20:05.733  -->  00:20:07.237
and to see what looks best.
424

424

00:20:07.237  -->  00:20:08.907
I just don't want to lose a lot of time
425

425

00:20:08.907  -->  00:20:11.267
by doing that now in here because otherwise
426

426

00:20:11.267  -->  00:20:13.344
we end up with a course with 50 hours
427

427

00:20:13.344  -->  00:20:15.542
and that's way too much.
428

428

00:20:15.542  -->  00:20:20.093
But again, please play around with these values.
429

429

00:20:20.093  -->  00:20:23.242
Okay, and finally, translating the button
430

430

00:20:23.242  -->  00:20:27.873
in the Y direction for 2px, minus 2px actually,
431

431

00:20:27.873  -->  00:20:31.293
so we're gonna move it up as we discussed earlier.
432

432

00:20:31.293  -->  00:20:32.226
Okay.
433

433

00:20:32.226  -->  00:20:36.579
Since we want this to be animated, all of it,
434

434

00:20:36.579  -->  00:20:39.645
let's add the transition property here,
435

435

00:20:39.645  -->  00:20:41.895
transition: all .2 seconds.
436

436

00:20:42.822  -->  00:20:45.746
All right, and finally, for the active,
437

437

00:20:45.746  -->  00:20:49.829
we want the box shadow, let's actually copy this,
438

438

00:20:51.677  -->  00:20:54.557
so the box shadow of .5rem
439

439

00:20:54.557  -->  00:20:56.307
and then here just 1.
440

440

00:20:57.198  -->  00:20:59.482
To translate it, we can actually move it back
441

441

00:20:59.482  -->  00:21:01.885
to its initial position, so zero.
442

442

00:21:01.885  -->  00:21:03.635
So let's take a look.
443

443

00:21:04.935  -->  00:21:06.185
Can close this.
444

444

00:21:10.011  -->  00:21:12.608
Well, something's not working here,
445

445

00:21:12.608  -->  00:21:14.602
at least not with the hover.
446

446

00:21:14.602  -->  00:21:16.165
Let me see why that's happening.
447

447

00:21:16.165  -->  00:21:17.507
All right.
448

448

00:21:17.507  -->  00:21:21.674
Maybe you spotted it already, but somehow I did not.
449

449

00:21:23.724  -->  00:21:25.974
Now it's working just fine.
450

450

00:21:27.192  -->  00:21:28.442
You see, check.
451

451

00:21:31.356  -->  00:21:33.189
Okay, and now with this part done
452

452

00:21:33.189  -->  00:21:35.429
with everything working as expected,
453

453

00:21:35.429  -->  00:21:37.947
you should probably take another break
454

454

00:21:37.947  -->  00:21:39.657
so that this video doesn't
455

455

00:21:39.657  -->  00:21:42.506
become one hour-long video or something.
