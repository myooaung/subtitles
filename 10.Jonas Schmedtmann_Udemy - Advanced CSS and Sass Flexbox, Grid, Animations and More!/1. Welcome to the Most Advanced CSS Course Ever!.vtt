00:00:02.958  -->  00:00:04.978
<v ->Hello, and welcome to the most advanced</v>
2

2

00:00:04.978  -->  00:00:07.677
and modern CSS course in the world.
3

3

00:00:07.677  -->  00:00:10.787
I'm really excited to have you in this massive course
4

4

00:00:10.787  -->  00:00:12.662
and I promise you made the right choice
5

5

00:00:12.662  -->  00:00:15.026
by joining me in this adventure.
6

6

00:00:15.026  -->  00:00:17.110
Now, without further ado, I want to give you
7

7

00:00:17.110  -->  00:00:19.923
a quick overview of how the course is organized,
8

8

00:00:19.923  -->  00:00:22.282
the projects that are included in the course,
9

9

00:00:22.282  -->  00:00:25.119
and what exactly you are gonna learn.
10

10

00:00:25.119  -->  00:00:28.482
So, the course contains a total of seven sections
11

11

00:00:28.482  -->  00:00:31.553
with over 20 hours of content.
12

12

00:00:31.553  -->  00:00:33.548
We start with section two, where we're gonna
13

13

00:00:33.548  -->  00:00:35.663
jump right into our first project
14

14

00:00:35.663  -->  00:00:38.490
and start learning some advanced CSS.
15

15

00:00:38.490  -->  00:00:40.388
So, this is the Natours project that we're
16

16

00:00:40.388  -->  00:00:42.499
going to start building in section two,
17

17

00:00:42.499  -->  00:00:45.047
all the way to the end of section six.
18

18

00:00:45.047  -->  00:00:47.157
It's a huge landing page that I designed
19

19

00:00:47.157  -->  00:00:49.825
specifically to teach you a lot of different
20

20

00:00:49.825  -->  00:00:51.981
new CSS properties and techniques.
21

21

00:00:51.981  -->  00:00:54.830
Animations, advanced responsive design,
22

22

00:00:54.830  -->  00:00:57.682
CSS architecture and much more.
23

23

00:00:57.682  -->  00:00:59.678
And you see that there are lot of effects
24

24

00:00:59.678  -->  00:01:01.970
going on here on this page.
25

25

00:01:01.970  -->  00:01:05.324
Now, in section three we take a detailed look
26

26

00:01:05.324  -->  00:01:08.105
at how CSS actually works behind the scenes
27

27

00:01:08.105  -->  00:01:11.236
and we're also gonna talk a bit about CSS architecture,
28

28

00:01:11.236  -->  00:01:13.480
so that you can gain the kind of knowledge
29

29

00:01:13.480  -->  00:01:17.064
that many CSS developers out there don't have.
30

30

00:01:17.064  -->  00:01:19.346
Next up, I will introduce you to Sass
31

31

00:01:19.346  -->  00:01:21.161
and to the NPM ecosystem,
32

32

00:01:21.161  -->  00:01:23.583
which will give you a whole new set of tools,
33

33

00:01:23.583  -->  00:01:27.008
allowing you to write and compile Sass code.
34

34

00:01:27.008  -->  00:01:30.039
Then, section five is the biggest part of the course
35

35

00:01:30.039  -->  00:01:32.163
and this is where we will continue building
36

36

00:01:32.163  -->  00:01:34.385
the Natours project that I showed you,
37

37

00:01:34.385  -->  00:01:36.093
and where you will learn countless new
38

38

00:01:36.093  -->  00:01:38.566
CSS properties and features.
39

39

00:01:38.566  -->  00:01:40.447
After that, in section six,
40

40

00:01:40.447  -->  00:01:42.658
we keep building the Natours project,
41

41

00:01:42.658  -->  00:01:47.099
but now with a heavy focus on advanced responsive design.
42

42

00:01:47.099  -->  00:01:49.844
In section seven we then build a whole new project,
43

43

00:01:49.844  -->  00:01:52.986
this time using the immense power of Flexbox.
44

44

00:01:52.986  -->  00:01:55.946
So, I will introduce you to this amazing new technology,
45

45

00:01:55.946  -->  00:01:58.338
and then we build this entire modern-looking
46

46

00:01:58.338  -->  00:02:01.523
project called Trillo, using Flexbox and some
47

47

00:02:01.523  -->  00:02:04.491
other stuff that I'm going to show you as well.
48

48

00:02:04.491  -->  00:02:06.482
And finally, you're gonna learn the latest
49

49

00:02:06.482  -->  00:02:09.597
cutting edge CSS Grid layout technology.
50

50

00:02:09.597  -->  00:02:11.585
So, in section eight I'm gonna teach you
51

51

00:02:11.585  -->  00:02:14.162
the very fundamentals of CSS Grid and then
52

52

00:02:14.162  -->  00:02:17.367
in section nine we will build yet another project
53

53

00:02:17.367  -->  00:02:20.255
which is called Nexter and uses CSS Grid
54

54

00:02:20.255  -->  00:02:23.210
for a large variety of UI elements,
55

55

00:02:23.210  -->  00:02:25.045
so that you can apply grids to many
56

56

00:02:25.045  -->  00:02:27.206
different real world situations.
57

57

00:02:27.206  -->  00:02:29.225
All right, so that is a broad overview
58

58

00:02:29.225  -->  00:02:31.543
of the course structure.
59

59

00:02:31.543  -->  00:02:34.255
Now, in all the videos I always do my best
60

60

00:02:34.255  -->  00:02:37.219
to explain every single detail of the techniques
61

61

00:02:37.219  -->  00:02:40.165
that I'm using or the technologies that I'm introducing,
62

62

00:02:40.165  -->  00:02:42.794
but sometimes you may still have a question
63

63

00:02:42.794  -->  00:02:45.637
about any of the topics that you're learning.
64

64

00:02:45.637  -->  00:02:49.418
And that's fantastic, because asking questions is great.
65

65

00:02:49.418  -->  00:02:52.233
Or maybe you just run into a problem with your code
66

66

00:02:52.233  -->  00:02:54.857
and need help fixing it, because it doesn't really
67

67

00:02:54.857  -->  00:02:56.771
work the way it should.
68

68

00:02:56.771  -->  00:02:59.401
Either way, you will always get support and help
69

69

00:02:59.401  -->  00:03:01.752
in a You To Me Q&amp;A section.
70

70

00:03:01.752  -->  00:03:03.941
So, at the bottom of the video that you're watching
71

71

00:03:03.941  -->  00:03:07.442
you will find a question section for that specific video
72

72

00:03:07.442  -->  00:03:10.089
and whenever you have a question, you can check out
73

73

00:03:10.089  -->  00:03:12.748
if other students may have asked the same question
74

74

00:03:12.748  -->  00:03:15.685
and if not you can just post your own question
75

75

00:03:15.685  -->  00:03:17.995
and you will then get friendly support
76

76

00:03:17.995  -->  00:03:21.287
so that you're back to writing code as fast as possible.
77

77

00:03:21.287  -->  00:03:24.797
And now, just to finish, I designed this course for you,
78

78

00:03:24.797  -->  00:03:27.746
to bring your CSS skills to the most modern
79

79

00:03:27.746  -->  00:03:30.291
and advanced level and to give you the tools
80

80

00:03:30.291  -->  00:03:32.797
so that you can build any webpage or app
81

81

00:03:32.797  -->  00:03:35.533
that you can imagine from the ground up.
82

82

00:03:35.533  -->  00:03:37.831
And so we cover everything that all the other
83

83

00:03:37.831  -->  00:03:40.372
courses don't cover, so that you can become
84

84

00:03:40.372  -->  00:03:43.753
the confident front end web developer that you want to be.
85

85

00:03:43.753  -->  00:03:46.138
That is my main goal with this course.
86

86

00:03:46.138  -->  00:03:50.305
And with that being said, let's finally get started with it.
