00:00:01.172  -->  00:00:02.497
<v Narrator>In this lecture, we will build</v>
2

2

00:00:02.497  -->  00:00:04.553
the overall layout of our app.
3

3

00:00:04.553  -->  00:00:07.209
And so, first discuss how to do that and
4

4

00:00:07.209  -->  00:00:10.415
then use flexbox for the first time, in real life
5

5

00:00:10.415  -->  00:00:13.082
to create a part of that layout.
6

6

00:00:14.568  -->  00:00:16.749
So looking at the final design of our app,
7

7

00:00:16.749  -->  00:00:20.525
what can we say about the overall layout of this interface?
8

8

00:00:20.525  -->  00:00:24.092
Well first of all, there is this huge container here.
9

9

00:00:24.092  -->  00:00:27.688
So all of this, which actually holds the entire app.
10

10

00:00:27.688  -->  00:00:28.521
Okay.
11

11

00:00:28.521  -->  00:00:30.943
And that container is also nicely centered
12

12

00:00:30.943  -->  00:00:32.417
here in the view port.
13

13

00:00:32.417  -->  00:00:34.228
So that's the first element of the layout.
14

14

00:00:34.228  -->  00:00:37.725
Then in this container, we first have this header part
15

15

00:00:37.725  -->  00:00:40.573
here, let's say, where we have the logo,
16

16

00:00:40.573  -->  00:00:44.980
the search bar and these user navigation items.
17

17

00:00:44.980  -->  00:00:45.813
Okay.
18

18

00:00:45.813  -->  00:00:47.813
So this here is the header.
19

19

00:00:47.813  -->  00:00:50.966
And then below that we basically have two big parts.
20

20

00:00:50.966  -->  00:00:53.153
The first one I call the sidebar,
21

21

00:00:53.153  -->  00:00:54.333
which is this one here.
22

22

00:00:54.333  -->  00:00:58.999
It has the navigation and it has this small legal text here.
23

23

00:00:58.999  -->  00:01:00.088
Okay.
24

24

00:01:00.088  -->  00:01:02.641
And then on the right side, we have this hotel overview
25

25

00:01:02.641  -->  00:01:05.256
which is what I like to call this, so a huge block,
26

26

00:01:05.256  -->  00:01:07.812
which then contain all of this information
27

27

00:01:07.812  -->  00:01:10.906
about this hotel that we are currently watching.
28

28

00:01:10.906  -->  00:01:13.487
So these are the three big parts inside of the container
29

29

00:01:13.487  -->  00:01:16.102
first the header here on top, then on the left side the
30

30

00:01:16.102  -->  00:01:20.205
sidebar and then here on the right side the hotel view.
31

31

00:01:20.205  -->  00:01:21.038
Okay.
32

32

00:01:21.038  -->  00:01:23.050
So let's mark that up in html before
33

33

00:01:23.050  -->  00:01:25.383
we start writing CSS for it.
34

34

00:01:27.850  -->  00:01:29.821
So let's start with the overall container,
35

35

00:01:29.821  -->  00:01:32.571
I'm using a div element for that.
36

36

00:01:33.453  -->  00:01:37.536
And once again using element here, so container.
37

37

00:01:37.536  -->  00:01:39.296
So that's our container where the rest
38

38

00:01:39.296  -->  00:01:41.352
all of the content will be.
39

39

00:01:41.352  -->  00:01:43.704
Then in there we have, as I mentioned the header.
40

40

00:01:43.704  -->  00:01:45.371
And for that one we are going to use the
41

41

00:01:45.371  -->  00:01:47.371
header element in HTML5.
42

42

00:01:48.770  -->  00:01:51.811
So header, with the class of header.
43

43

00:01:51.811  -->  00:01:55.978
So that's the top part that's actually right in here.
44

44

00:01:58.273  -->  00:02:00.978
So the header part and then remember that
45

45

00:02:00.978  -->  00:02:04.396
we have the sidebar and the hotel view.
46

46

00:02:04.396  -->  00:02:05.973
Now in order to position these two elements
47

47

00:02:05.973  -->  00:02:08.445
we actually need a container for them.
48

48

00:02:08.445  -->  00:02:09.278
Okay.
49

49

00:02:09.278  -->  00:02:12.192
And I am going to call that one, content.
50

50

00:02:12.192  -->  00:02:15.202
So I'm using a div again and then content.
51

51

00:02:15.202  -->  00:02:16.899
So basically content is like the entire
52

52

00:02:16.899  -->  00:02:19.359
part which is below the header.
53

53

00:02:19.359  -->  00:02:21.541
So it's the sidebar, for which I am using
54

54

00:02:21.541  -->  00:02:23.951
the nav HTML5 element because
55

55

00:02:23.951  -->  00:02:25.783
it mainly holds a navigation.
56

56

00:02:25.783  -->  00:02:29.203
Okay, so I think Nav is the best element to show that
57

57

00:02:29.203  -->  00:02:31.698
to convey that meaning to the element.
58

58

00:02:31.698  -->  00:02:32.531
Okay.
59

59

00:02:32.531  -->  00:02:34.531
So nav and then sidebar.
60

60

00:02:38.060  -->  00:02:41.600
I'm writing navigation here just so we know what box is what
61

61

00:02:41.600  -->  00:02:44.097
and then we have the hotel view.
62

62

00:02:44.097  -->  00:02:46.740
And this time I'm using the Main HTML5 element
63

63

00:02:46.740  -->  00:02:48.812
because I think it's the perfect element
64

64

00:02:48.812  -->  00:02:51.534
because as the name says, the main element
65

65

00:02:51.534  -->  00:02:55.507
is where the main part of the website or web app goes.
66

66

00:02:55.507  -->  00:02:58.892
And in this case, that's clearly this hotel view.
67

67

00:02:58.892  -->  00:03:01.642
Okay and so main is perfect here.
68

68

00:03:04.054  -->  00:03:05.410
So hotel view.
69

69

00:03:05.410  -->  00:03:08.144
And that is actually already our overall layout.
70

70

00:03:08.144  -->  00:03:10.346
Okay, so that's exactly what we have here.
71

71

00:03:10.346  -->  00:03:13.672
Header and then the content, which is all of this together
72

72

00:03:13.672  -->  00:03:15.772
and then on the left side the navigation
73

73

00:03:15.772  -->  00:03:18.492
or the sidebar, actually how I called it and
74

74

00:03:18.492  -->  00:03:21.636
then here on the right side the hotel view.
75

75

00:03:21.636  -->  00:03:25.200
So now let's move over to our layout file here
76

76

00:03:25.200  -->  00:03:27.450
and start writing our code.
77

77

00:03:30.312  -->  00:03:34.062
So we have our container, we have our header,
78

78

00:03:38.577  -->  00:03:42.244
the content, sidebar and finally hotel-view.
79

79

00:03:49.247  -->  00:03:51.310
And let's start with our container.
80

80

00:03:51.310  -->  00:03:53.191
So the first thing I want to define is
81

81

00:03:53.191  -->  00:03:55.189
the width of this container.
82

82

00:03:55.189  -->  00:03:58.065
And then once again I'm going to use max width here.
83

83

00:03:58.065  -->  00:03:59.894
So that the container can decrease if there
84

84

00:03:59.894  -->  00:04:03.352
is not enough space to display our 120rem
85

85

00:04:03.352  -->  00:04:06.069
which is the width we want for this container, okay?
86

86

00:04:06.069  -->  00:04:07.978
Aright, so 1,200 pixels basically,
87

87

00:04:07.978  -->  00:04:10.829
if we have enough space, but if it's not enough space,
88

88

00:04:10.829  -->  00:04:14.052
so if the view port is less that 1,200 pixels,
89

89

00:04:14.052  -->  00:04:18.877
then we simply occupy 100% of the available view port width.
90

90

00:04:18.877  -->  00:04:21.954
Okay and that's what max width does.
91

91

00:04:21.954  -->  00:04:26.167
Alright, then I also want to center it in the view port.
92

92

00:04:26.167  -->  00:04:28.492
I'm using an old trick here with margin.
93

93

00:04:28.492  -->  00:04:31.413
Okay, so top and bottom let's actually put
94

94

00:04:31.413  -->  00:04:33.365
8rem here, so 80 pixels and then the left
95

95

00:04:33.365  -->  00:04:35.822
and right side set to auto as we did
96

96

00:04:35.822  -->  00:04:37.956
in the previous project as well.
97

97

00:04:37.956  -->  00:04:40.592
Okay and so that centers the container inside
98

98

00:04:40.592  -->  00:04:43.230
of its parent element which is the body in this case.
99

99

00:04:43.230  -->  00:04:47.230
Now we also a background color in this container
100

100

00:04:48.106  -->  00:04:52.273
and the one I am going to use is --color-grey-light-2.
101

101

00:04:56.141  -->  00:04:57.460
Okay, so this one.
102

102

00:04:57.460  -->  00:04:58.534
Let me show it to you.
103

103

00:04:58.534  -->  00:04:59.367
So base.
104

104

00:05:01.590  -->  00:05:03.050
I'm actually going to leave it open here.
105

105

00:05:03.050  -->  00:05:06.794
So, this is the gray color that I defined
106

106

00:05:06.794  -->  00:05:08.377
for the background.
107

107

00:05:11.146  -->  00:05:14.479
And then we also want a nice box shadow,
108

108

00:05:15.741  -->  00:05:17.232
and a really dark one actually,
109

109

00:05:17.232  -->  00:05:20.020
so zero in the X direction, of course
110

110

00:05:20.020  -->  00:05:24.020
and 2rem and now 6rem so really a huge blur here
111

111

00:05:27.005  -->  00:05:28.755
and then 8.3 opacity.
112

112

00:05:30.806  -->  00:05:32.012
Okay.
113

113

00:05:32.012  -->  00:05:34.254
So let's actually take a look at that.
114

114

00:05:34.254  -->  00:05:35.261
Well actually before,
115

115

00:05:35.261  -->  00:05:38.825
we should maybe define a height here as well.
116

116

00:05:38.825  -->  00:05:41.742
So a max, or actually a min height.
117

117

00:05:43.136  -->  00:05:47.684
Okay and so this is for testing purposes once again.
118

118

00:05:47.684  -->  00:05:50.015
Okay and so now we can take a look at the result
119

119

00:05:50.015  -->  00:05:51.575
and here we go.
120

120

00:05:51.575  -->  00:05:54.170
Okay, let's close this one here.
121

121

00:05:54.170  -->  00:05:55.622
And so that looks pretty good already.
122

122

00:05:55.622  -->  00:05:58.817
So we have our nice shadow here and we can see
123

123

00:05:58.817  -->  00:06:02.008
our three layout elements here as well so header,
124

124

00:06:02.008  -->  00:06:04.108
navigation and hotel-view.
125

125

00:06:04.108  -->  00:06:07.464
So let's go back and actually we can reuse this shadow
126

126

00:06:07.464  -->  00:06:09.311
maybe in the future and so I want to show you
127

127

00:06:09.311  -->  00:06:11.097
that we can not only use colors,
128

128

00:06:11.097  -->  00:06:14.883
we can use other stuff as well as variables, okay.
129

129

00:06:14.883  -->  00:06:19.050
So let's add a new one here simply called shadow-dark
130

130

00:06:22.300  -->  00:06:24.265
and then we can do it like this.
131

131

00:06:24.265  -->  00:06:25.930
So variables of course not only work for
132

132

00:06:25.930  -->  00:06:28.581
colors here we can store other
133

133

00:06:28.581  -->  00:06:30.951
things in there as well.
134

134

00:06:30.951  -->  00:06:33.972
So let me now just copy this and in here I can
135

135

00:06:33.972  -->  00:06:38.139
simply say var again and then the name of the variable.
136

136

00:06:39.109  -->  00:06:41.516
So, let's check that out and you see
137

137

00:06:41.516  -->  00:06:43.146
it still works the same, okay.
138

138

00:06:43.146  -->  00:06:47.403
So now if we need it, we can reuse it later in the project.
139

139

00:06:47.403  -->  00:06:49.170
Okay, so now it's time for the header.
140

140

00:06:49.170  -->  00:06:50.335
And here once again I am going to
141

141

00:06:50.335  -->  00:06:52.830
define the height and this one will
142

142

00:06:52.830  -->  00:06:55.982
be 7rem, so 70 pixels in height.
143

143

00:06:55.982  -->  00:06:59.612
I want it to have a background color, a white one.
144

144

00:06:59.612  -->  00:07:01.191
And this time I am simply just going to
145

145

00:07:01.191  -->  00:07:05.118
write out FFF because I know that that means white.
146

146

00:07:05.118  -->  00:07:09.170
And then is should also have border bottom.
147

147

00:07:09.170  -->  00:07:11.207
Okay, next to the color that I want here is
148

148

00:07:11.207  -->  00:07:15.374
light gray and the one that I want here is gray number one.
149

149

00:07:17.943  -->  00:07:22.096
So there are just subtle variations of the same light gray.
150

150

00:07:22.096  -->  00:07:24.202
So let me show that to you.
151

151

00:07:24.202  -->  00:07:25.673
Okay and so here you see it,
152

152

00:07:25.673  -->  00:07:28.801
so next up let's think about the navigation
153

153

00:07:28.801  -->  00:07:30.990
and the hotel view.
154

154

00:07:30.990  -->  00:07:35.095
So for the sidebar we want a background color
155

155

00:07:35.095  -->  00:07:37.012
of this dark gray here.
156

156

00:07:39.002  -->  00:07:41.335
So the darkest color of all.
157

157

00:07:44.747  -->  00:07:49.384
So var and grey-dark-1 and then on the hotel view,
158

158

00:07:49.384  -->  00:07:51.845
we simply want a white background.
159

159

00:07:51.845  -->  00:07:54.920
So let's grab this one as well.
160

160

00:07:54.920  -->  00:07:57.144
And now lets take a look again.
161

161

00:07:57.144  -->  00:07:59.437
And alright, now of course you want these two
162

162

00:07:59.437  -->  00:08:01.931
to be side by side, right?
163

163

00:08:01.931  -->  00:08:04.070
So the navigation on the left side and
164

164

00:08:04.070  -->  00:08:05.917
the hotel view on the right side
165

165

00:08:05.917  -->  00:08:08.923
and what is the perfect tool for doing that?
166

166

00:08:08.923  -->  00:08:10.412
And I'm sure you guessed it,
167

167

00:08:10.412  -->  00:08:13.181
we're going to use flexbox now.
168

168

00:08:13.181  -->  00:08:15.223
So, in order to start flexbox,
169

169

00:08:15.223  -->  00:08:17.643
all we need to do is to set the display
170

170

00:08:17.643  -->  00:08:21.493
property of the flex container to flex.
171

171

00:08:21.493  -->  00:08:22.481
Alright?
172

172

00:08:22.481  -->  00:08:23.981
So, this way flex.
173

173

00:08:25.233  -->  00:08:26.363
And that's it.
174

174

00:08:26.363  -->  00:08:28.891
So this one here of course will be our flex container.
175

175

00:08:28.891  -->  00:08:31.928
Because it's the one that holds the two
176

176

00:08:31.928  -->  00:08:33.938
elements we want side by side.
177

177

00:08:33.938  -->  00:08:36.327
So content will be our flex container
178

178

00:08:36.327  -->  00:08:40.498
and sidebar and hotel view will be our two flex items.
179

179

00:08:40.498  -->  00:08:41.781
Okay.
180

180

00:08:41.781  -->  00:08:44.579
So just to see if this actually worked,
181

181

00:08:44.579  -->  00:08:46.699
let's take a look and yeah.
182

182

00:08:46.699  -->  00:08:48.755
So actually they are side by side now,
183

183

00:08:48.755  -->  00:08:50.944
not occupying a lot of space of course
184

184

00:08:50.944  -->  00:08:53.487
but they are already side by side
185

185

00:08:53.487  -->  00:08:55.155
and so that's a good starting point.
186

186

00:08:55.155  -->  00:08:57.654
Now let's put some properties on the individual
187

187

00:08:57.654  -->  00:09:01.619
items in order to make them look more like this here.
188

188

00:09:01.619  -->  00:09:02.775
Okay.
189

189

00:09:02.775  -->  00:09:05.959
So the navigation should have a width and I'm sure
190

190

00:09:05.959  -->  00:09:08.592
that you know how to do that, right?
191

191

00:09:08.592  -->  00:09:11.618
So the property that we use to flexbox to define width
192

192

00:09:11.618  -->  00:09:14.863
is the flex phases property, now we should always
193

193

00:09:14.863  -->  00:09:17.587
use it in the shortened flex property, okay.
194

194

00:09:17.587  -->  00:09:19.106
So that's what we are going to do now.
195

195

00:09:19.106  -->  00:09:22.264
So, flex and the first one is flex grow.
196

196

00:09:22.264  -->  00:09:23.807
And we don't want the elements to grow
197

197

00:09:23.807  -->  00:09:26.522
besides the width that we are going to define.
198

198

00:09:26.522  -->  00:09:28.455
We also do not want it to shrink, okay
199

199

00:09:28.455  -->  00:09:30.731
because remember that the second value
200

200

00:09:30.731  -->  00:09:33.002
here stands for flex shrink.
201

201

00:09:33.002  -->  00:09:35.856
So it's zero as well and then we flex
202

202

00:09:35.856  -->  00:09:37.773
bases with is 18%.
203

203

00:09:38.849  -->  00:09:39.849
And that's it.
204

204

00:09:39.849  -->  00:09:42.127
So 18% is the number that I can up with
205

205

00:09:42.127  -->  00:09:46.035
which is the perfect width for this sidebar.
206

206

00:09:46.035  -->  00:09:47.817
But you can experiment here with other numbers
207

207

00:09:47.817  -->  00:09:50.998
until it fits the perfect width for you.
208

208

00:09:50.998  -->  00:09:51.948
And so that's it.
209

209

00:09:51.948  -->  00:09:55.358
So once again with flex, we set and that don't want
210

210

00:09:55.358  -->  00:09:57.643
the element to grow if there's some space
211

211

00:09:57.643  -->  00:09:58.753
we also don't want it
212

212

00:09:58.753  -->  00:10:01.185
to shirk if there's not enough space but
213

213

00:10:01.185  -->  00:10:03.803
we always want to keep at 18%.
214

214

00:10:03.803  -->  00:10:06.417
And since it's a percent value it's actually okay
215

215

00:10:06.417  -->  00:10:08.937
to say that we don't want it to shrink
216

216

00:10:08.937  -->  00:10:10.772
because it will automatically shrink because
217

217

00:10:10.772  -->  00:10:12.418
it's a percentage, right?
218

218

00:10:12.418  -->  00:10:14.011
So its not like pixel value.
219

219

00:10:14.011  -->  00:10:16.132
In that case it would be better to allow it
220

220

00:10:16.132  -->  00:10:19.737
to shrink, but right now its good like this, okay?
221

221

00:10:19.737  -->  00:10:22.143
So let's check it out.
222

222

00:10:22.143  -->  00:10:24.644
And alright, you see here that it has
223

223

00:10:24.644  -->  00:10:27.756
now this 18% and the hotel view,
224

224

00:10:27.756  -->  00:10:30.025
well it's still just very small.
225

225

00:10:30.025  -->  00:10:32.099
Let's actually give it a background color as well
226

226

00:10:32.099  -->  00:10:35.349
a different one, to see it a bit better
227

227

00:10:36.759  -->  00:10:40.534
So I'm sure you guessed it, it's orange red again.
228

228

00:10:40.534  -->  00:10:43.953
So you see that this element is still very small
229

229

00:10:43.953  -->  00:10:46.361
which of course we don't want.
230

230

00:10:46.361  -->  00:10:50.102
We want it to occupy the entire remaining space, right?
231

231

00:10:50.102  -->  00:10:52.534
So usually flexbox terms we want it to
232

232

00:10:52.534  -->  00:10:56.004
grow as much as it can and what it means in code
233

233

00:10:56.004  -->  00:10:58.171
is to simply say flex one.
234

234

00:11:02.602  -->  00:11:03.938
Okay and that's it.
235

235

00:11:03.938  -->  00:11:06.692
So again by using flex one what we say
236

236

00:11:06.692  -->  00:11:09.939
is that the element should grow as much as it can.
237

237

00:11:09.939  -->  00:11:12.228
So over all the available space that it has
238

238

00:11:12.228  -->  00:11:13.615
and that's what happened here
239

239

00:11:13.615  -->  00:11:16.181
so now it grew all the way until the right side
240

240

00:11:16.181  -->  00:11:19.701
and it's occupying the remaining 82%, right?
241

241

00:11:19.701  -->  00:11:22.342
So, 100 minus 18 is 82.
242

242

00:11:22.342  -->  00:11:24.541
And so that is the power of flexbox
243

243

00:11:24.541  -->  00:11:27.567
there's no floats, there's no clear fixes
244

244

00:11:27.567  -->  00:11:30.483
there's no weird hacks like all that,
245

245

00:11:30.483  -->  00:11:33.048
just very simple, just three lines of code.
246

246

00:11:33.048  -->  00:11:35.724
We just wrote this flex here, flex here
247

247

00:11:35.724  -->  00:11:37.644
and the display to flex.
248

248

00:11:37.644  -->  00:11:41.782
So that was all we needed to create the small layout.
249

249

00:11:41.782  -->  00:11:43.763
Okay, and that's actually all I had to show you
250

250

00:11:43.763  -->  00:11:45.075
in this lecture.
251

251

00:11:45.075  -->  00:11:47.748
So the overall layout is now coded up
252

252

00:11:47.748  -->  00:11:51.492
and we're ready to start building here the header
253

253

00:11:51.492  -->  00:11:55.659
So that's what we're going to do, right in the next lecture.
