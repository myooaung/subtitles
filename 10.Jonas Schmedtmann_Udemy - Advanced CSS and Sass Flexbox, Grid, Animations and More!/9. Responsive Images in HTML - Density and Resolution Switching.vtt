00:00:01.436  -->  00:00:03.737
<v Instructor>After our direction in the last lecture,</v>
2

2

00:00:03.737  -->  00:00:05.570
we're now gonna implement resolution
3

3

00:00:05.570  -->  00:00:07.910
switching with HTML.
4

4

00:00:07.910  -->  00:00:10.241
And so, you're gonna learn how to allow the browser
5

5

00:00:10.241  -->  00:00:13.051
to decide which is the best image to download,
6

6

00:00:13.051  -->  00:00:15.937
using the source set attribute with descriptors
7

7

00:00:15.937  -->  00:00:19.722
and the size attribute of the image element.
8

8

00:00:19.722  -->  00:00:22.658
But before we do all of that, I wanted to show you something
9

9

00:00:22.658  -->  00:00:25.399
here in the dev tools which allows us to also
10

10

00:00:25.399  -->  00:00:28.066
test out the resolution of our screen.
11

11

00:00:28.066  -->  00:00:30.340
So we can come up here to this menu
12

12

00:00:30.340  -->  00:00:33.428
and hit add device pixel ratio.
13

13

00:00:33.428  -->  00:00:37.572
And so, now we can test if we have the two x
14

14

00:00:37.572  -->  00:00:40.364
or the one x image here going on.
15

15

00:00:40.364  -->  00:00:41.930
Now, the problem with this is that
16

16

00:00:41.930  -->  00:00:44.157
it doesn't really work well.
17

17

00:00:44.157  -->  00:00:45.687
So I've done some experiments with this
18

18

00:00:45.687  -->  00:00:47.405
in the past four couple of hours.
19

19

00:00:47.405  -->  00:00:49.461
And it usually didn't always work.
20

20

00:00:49.461  -->  00:00:50.992
So that's the kind of the problem.
21

21

00:00:50.992  -->  00:00:53.029
But let's try it out now.
22

22

00:00:53.029  -->  00:00:56.214
So, the device pixel ratio here is now set to one.
23

23

00:00:56.214  -->  00:00:59.344
And that means that we have a low resolution screen.
24

24

00:00:59.344  -->  00:01:01.945
And so, therefore what we have here should be
25

25

00:01:01.945  -->  00:01:04.637
the logo green one x, so this one here.
26

26

00:01:04.637  -->  00:01:06.979
Now, in order to be absolutely sure,
27

27

00:01:06.979  -->  00:01:09.987
we can actually come here to the inspector.
28

28

00:01:09.987  -->  00:01:13.069
Then come here to this, which says properties,
29

29

00:01:13.069  -->  00:01:16.183
then here to image, and down here we can see
30

30

00:01:16.183  -->  00:01:18.287
the current source.
31

31

00:01:18.287  -->  00:01:20.944
And so, here we can see that it's actually using
32

32

00:01:20.944  -->  00:01:22.807
logo green one x.
33

33

00:01:22.807  -->  00:01:26.306
So for a device pixel ratio of one.
34

34

00:01:26.306  -->  00:01:28.597
Now, if we change this to two,
35

35

00:01:28.597  -->  00:01:32.494
let's reload the page, and I think that now
36

36

00:01:32.494  -->  00:01:34.572
it actually changed.
37

37

00:01:34.572  -->  00:01:38.003
And so, if you come here now to current source,
38

38

00:01:38.003  -->  00:01:40.574
then we see logo green two x.
39

39

00:01:40.574  -->  00:01:44.069
And so now as we're simulating a high resolution screen,
40

40

00:01:44.069  -->  00:01:46.838
then the browser actually uses our higher resolution image.
41

41

00:01:46.838  -->  00:01:48.418
So that's working.
42

42

00:01:48.418  -->  00:01:51.975
Now for the small screen, let's reload that again.
43

43

00:01:51.975  -->  00:01:55.058
And take a look at what we have here.
44

44

00:01:57.861  -->  00:02:01.507
And, yeah, so it's using the logo small at two x.
45

45

00:02:01.507  -->  00:02:04.073
So still again, as we planned.
46

46

00:02:04.073  -->  00:02:06.681
So this one here right now.
47

47

00:02:06.681  -->  00:02:10.020
And now let's change it here to one as well.
48

48

00:02:10.020  -->  00:02:13.353
Reload it, and now I think at this time,
49

49

00:02:14.924  -->  00:02:16.158
it didn't really work.
50

50

00:02:16.158  -->  00:02:17.491
Let's test that.
51

51

00:02:18.816  -->  00:02:21.605
And, yeah, so it still says two x.
52

52

00:02:21.605  -->  00:02:23.374
But that's a problem here in Google Chrome.
53

53

00:02:23.374  -->  00:02:27.069
So, actually, if you would still use this
54

54

00:02:27.069  -->  00:02:29.638
in the real world, then the right image would load.
55

55

00:02:29.638  -->  00:02:32.085
Okay, so don't worry about the result here so much.
56

56

00:02:32.085  -->  00:02:33.791
Let's try that again.
57

57

00:02:33.791  -->  00:02:37.431
And it still says green small two x.
58

58

00:02:37.431  -->  00:02:42.056
I'm gonna change this maybe to three or something.
59

59

00:02:42.056  -->  00:02:44.282
Then back to one, reload, and you have to really
60

60

00:02:44.282  -->  00:02:48.942
play around in order to get the right result here.
61

61

00:02:48.942  -->  00:02:51.001
It doesn't make much sense, but again I believe
62

62

00:02:51.001  -->  00:02:53.501
there is a small but going on.
63

63

00:02:54.803  -->  00:02:57.091
So let's try that again.
64

64

00:02:57.091  -->  00:02:59.482
Okay, and now we see green small one x.
65

65

00:02:59.482  -->  00:03:01.456
Okay, so that's the image that we want.
66

66

00:03:01.456  -->  00:03:03.938
And so, now Google Chrome is directly displaying that.
67

67

00:03:03.938  -->  00:03:08.525
Okay, so, besides testing here for different screen width,
68

68

00:03:08.525  -->  00:03:11.734
we can also simulate different device pixel ratios.
69

69

00:03:11.734  -->  00:03:14.543
So, basically different pixel densities.
70

70

00:03:14.543  -->  00:03:18.082
All right, but now it's time for resolution switching.
71

71

00:03:18.082  -->  00:03:20.656
And as I mentioned before, the images that I'm gonna use
72

72

00:03:20.656  -->  00:03:24.823
to experiment with that will be these images in here.
73

73

00:03:26.924  -->  00:03:30.468
So, let's take a look at when they start to change.
74

74

00:03:30.468  -->  00:03:34.327
And that's here at this 900 pixel query.
75

75

00:03:34.327  -->  00:03:38.101
All right, so let's get back to our HTML.
76

76

00:03:38.101  -->  00:03:41.435
And get our hands dirty with this code.
77

77

00:03:41.435  -->  00:03:44.045
So, where do we have this?
78

78

00:03:44.045  -->  00:03:46.128
And, yeah, so here we go.
79

79

00:03:47.117  -->  00:03:49.359
So, how do we actually approach this problem?
80

80

00:03:49.359  -->  00:03:52.261
Unlike in art direction where we basically forced
81

81

00:03:52.261  -->  00:03:54.111
the browser to use a certain image
82

82

00:03:54.111  -->  00:03:56.420
according to a media query,
83

83

00:03:56.420  -->  00:03:58.335
in this approach that we're using right now,
84

84

00:03:58.335  -->  00:04:00.369
we allow the browser to choose the best image
85

85

00:04:00.369  -->  00:04:04.004
for the current view port and pixel density situation.
86

86

00:04:04.004  -->  00:04:07.379
So, let's write out how we are going to do that.
87

87

00:04:07.379  -->  00:04:09.375
So again we're using an image.
88

88

00:04:09.375  -->  00:04:12.905
And again we're using the source set here.
89

89

00:04:12.905  -->  00:04:16.957
Now, for each of these image, so net one, two, and three,
90

90

00:04:16.957  -->  00:04:19.344
let's take a look here at the folder.
91

91

00:04:19.344  -->  00:04:22.427
So we have net one and net one large.
92

92

00:04:23.418  -->  00:04:25.253
So let's open these two.
93

93

00:04:25.253  -->  00:04:28.974
And so, you see that the big one has 1,000 pixels of width
94

94

00:04:28.974  -->  00:04:31.557
and a smaller one has only 300.
95

95

00:04:34.146  -->  00:04:36.479
So, our source set is image,
96

96

00:04:38.180  -->  00:04:40.180
net one, and then image,
97

97

00:04:44.306  -->  00:04:45.556
net one, large.
98

98

00:04:47.779  -->  00:04:49.885
All right, so right now this is a bit similar
99

99

00:04:49.885  -->  00:04:52.465
to density switching, which we did observe.
100

100

00:04:52.465  -->  00:04:54.961
But in density switching, we didn't use the
101

101

00:04:54.961  -->  00:04:56.701
density descriptors, right?
102

102

00:04:56.701  -->  00:04:58.474
Like one x or two x.
103

103

00:04:58.474  -->  00:05:00.461
But right now we're gonna use something else,
104

104

00:05:00.461  -->  00:05:02.946
which is called the width descriptor.
105

105

00:05:02.946  -->  00:05:05.106
And so, what we do here is to basically inform
106

106

00:05:05.106  -->  00:05:07.892
the browser of the width of these images.
107

107

00:05:07.892  -->  00:05:11.294
So, remember this one has 300 pixels.
108

108

00:05:11.294  -->  00:05:14.460
And so, we write 300w, okay,
109

109

00:05:14.460  -->  00:05:16.694
which probably stands for width.
110

110

00:05:16.694  -->  00:05:19.133
And then this one here has 1,000.
111

111

00:05:19.133  -->  00:05:21.306
And so, by using these width descriptors,
112

112

00:05:21.306  -->  00:05:23.838
we basically inform the browser of the width
113

113

00:05:23.838  -->  00:05:25.973
of each of these images without the browser
114

114

00:05:25.973  -->  00:05:27.878
having to download them to get access
115

115

00:05:27.878  -->  00:05:29.166
to that information.
116

116

00:05:29.166  -->  00:05:30.910
So that is the first step.
117

117

00:05:30.910  -->  00:05:33.286
Okay, but that alone is not enough for the browser
118

118

00:05:33.286  -->  00:05:35.654
to figure out which image to download,
119

119

00:05:35.654  -->  00:05:38.461
because what the browser knows is its view port width
120

120

00:05:38.461  -->  00:05:40.130
and its display density.
121

121

00:05:40.130  -->  00:05:42.827
But that alone is again not enough to decide
122

122

00:05:42.827  -->  00:05:45.738
which of these two images to choose.
123

123

00:05:45.738  -->  00:05:47.688
So we have to give it something else.
124

124

00:05:47.688  -->  00:05:51.021
And we do that with the sizes attribute.
125

125

00:05:53.197  -->  00:05:57.364
So, sizes, so what is the size attribute here all about?
126

126

00:05:59.451  -->  00:06:02.566
Well, basically we use sizes to inform the browser
127

127

00:06:02.566  -->  00:06:04.865
about the approximate width of the image
128

128

00:06:04.865  -->  00:06:06.692
at different view port width.
129

129

00:06:06.692  -->  00:06:08.762
And so, with that information, together
130

130

00:06:08.762  -->  00:06:11.293
with the width descriptor here, the browser can then
131

131

00:06:11.293  -->  00:06:13.145
figure out which is the perfect image
132

132

00:06:13.145  -->  00:06:15.250
to use for the current view port width
133

133

00:06:15.250  -->  00:06:17.429
and the current display resolution.
134

134

00:06:17.429  -->  00:06:20.028
So, let me show you how to do that.
135

135

00:06:20.028  -->  00:06:22.577
So, basically this is a list of a couple of break points
136

136

00:06:22.577  -->  00:06:24.734
that we define and that which we know
137

137

00:06:24.734  -->  00:06:28.570
approximately what the width of the image will be.
138

138

00:06:28.570  -->  00:06:30.770
So, let's use our break points
139

139

00:06:30.770  -->  00:06:33.418
that we've used before, so 900 pixels.
140

140

00:06:33.418  -->  00:06:36.984
Then here we say the width that the image will be.
141

141

00:06:36.984  -->  00:06:41.151
So, 900 pixels is this one here, no, actually this one.
142

142

00:06:43.116  -->  00:06:45.283
And so, let's take a look.
143

143

00:06:46.370  -->  00:06:47.646
Okay, so these are the images.
144

144

00:06:47.646  -->  00:06:48.550
That's the one we just included,
145

145

00:06:48.550  -->  00:06:52.090
but it's not working already, so let's ignore that for now.
146

146

00:06:52.090  -->  00:06:55.553
And so, this here is our image, so let's inspect it.
147

147

00:06:55.553  -->  00:06:58.602
And we see that width is like 170.
148

148

00:06:58.602  -->  00:07:02.769
And so, we can actually divide this, so 171 by 900.
149

149

00:07:05.479  -->  00:07:08.396
And so, this is basically 20%.
150

150

00:07:09.539  -->  00:07:12.041
So we can say basically that this image here
151

151

00:07:12.041  -->  00:07:16.347
has a width of 20% of the view port width.
152

152

00:07:16.347  -->  00:07:19.347
So let's inform the browser of that.
153

153

00:07:21.400  -->  00:07:23.904
That's it, actually, as simple as that.
154

154

00:07:23.904  -->  00:07:26.500
Now we can do another breakpoint,
155

155

00:07:26.500  -->  00:07:27.667
like 600 here.
156

156

00:07:29.409  -->  00:07:32.128
And so, let's see what we have here.
157

157

00:07:32.128  -->  00:07:33.878
Well, it's still 171.
158

158

00:07:37.109  -->  00:07:39.705
And so, now it's 28, 29, 30,
159

159

00:07:39.705  -->  00:07:41.783
we can actually say 30.
160

160

00:07:41.783  -->  00:07:45.450
Okay, so, let's say max width at 600 pixels,
161

161

00:07:53.051  -->  00:07:55.396
we have 30 view port width.
162

162

00:07:55.396  -->  00:07:57.933
Okay, and then at the end, like a default,
163

163

00:07:57.933  -->  00:08:00.842
we can put in the default size.
164

164

00:08:00.842  -->  00:08:02.259
And what is the default size?
165

165

00:08:02.259  -->  00:08:04.842
Well, our default font size is,
166

166

00:08:08.575  -->  00:08:10.825
I think it's defined it as,
167

167

00:08:12.803  -->  00:08:16.297
ah, and here we see it, approximately 300 pixels.
168

168

00:08:16.297  -->  00:08:17.366
Right, see that?
169

169

00:08:17.366  -->  00:08:20.033
It says 297, but we can say 300.
170

170

00:08:22.866  -->  00:08:24.435
So that's the default if none of these
171

171

00:08:24.435  -->  00:08:26.268
conditions here apply.
172

172

00:08:27.151  -->  00:08:29.878
All right, and so now we just need the alt attribute
173

173

00:08:29.878  -->  00:08:32.628
that we had before, so photo one.
174

174

00:08:33.922  -->  00:08:35.589
And also this class.
175

175

00:08:39.433  -->  00:08:41.561
And I'm putting it in a different line here
176

176

00:08:41.561  -->  00:08:43.455
so that it is easier to read.
177

177

00:08:43.455  -->  00:08:45.152
And actually we should do another thing
178

178

00:08:45.152  -->  00:08:47.514
which is to actually include the source
179

179

00:08:47.514  -->  00:08:49.264
as well in the image.
180

180

00:08:49.264  -->  00:08:52.864
And that is in case the user is using an older browser
181

181

00:08:52.864  -->  00:08:56.432
which doesn't support source set, neither sizes
182

182

00:08:56.432  -->  00:08:58.294
and these new attributes.
183

183

00:08:58.294  -->  00:09:02.385
So if a browser doesn't understand any of these here,
184

184

00:09:02.385  -->  00:09:05.207
then it can still use the source attribute.
185

185

00:09:05.207  -->  00:09:09.585
And we should do that down here in the footer as well.
186

186

00:09:09.585  -->  00:09:11.085
So, where is that?
187

187

00:09:14.896  -->  00:09:16.481
Ah, yeah, so right here.
188

188

00:09:16.481  -->  00:09:20.168
So let's set the source to this image here.
189

189

00:09:20.168  -->  00:09:23.038
Just in case source set is not supported by the browser
190

190

00:09:23.038  -->  00:09:24.955
that the user is using.
191

191

00:09:29.746  -->  00:09:32.274
Okay, but this will be ignored in case
192

192

00:09:32.274  -->  00:09:34.467
that the browser understands source set.
193

193

00:09:34.467  -->  00:09:36.550
So, no problem with that.
194

194

00:09:38.067  -->  00:09:39.567
So, let's go back.
195

195

00:09:40.991  -->  00:09:42.679
And here we go.
196

196

00:09:42.679  -->  00:09:46.679
That will now comment out this entire code here.
197

197

00:09:52.416  -->  00:09:56.083
And then copy this entire construct here for
198

198

00:10:00.453  -->  00:10:01.535
the other images.
199

199

00:10:01.535  -->  00:10:03.202
So here, here, here,
200

200

00:10:05.648  -->  00:10:06.815
here and here.
201

201

00:10:09.841  -->  00:10:12.341
It's all number two.
202

202

00:10:12.341  -->  00:10:15.174
All right, and then copy it again.
203

203

00:10:23.970  -->  00:10:24.887
Two, three,
204

204

00:10:27.283  -->  00:10:28.200
four, five.
205

205

00:10:30.472  -->  00:10:31.889
And all at three.
206

206

00:10:33.117  -->  00:10:34.869
And that is actually it.
207

207

00:10:34.869  -->  00:10:37.297
So this entire thing here will take care
208

208

00:10:37.297  -->  00:10:39.611
of actually both resolution switching
209

209

00:10:39.611  -->  00:10:41.089
and density switching.
210

210

00:10:41.089  -->  00:10:43.768
Because we gave the browser enough information
211

211

00:10:43.768  -->  00:10:45.515
to figure out exactly what to do
212

212

00:10:45.515  -->  00:10:47.736
depending on both the view port width
213

213

00:10:47.736  -->  00:10:50.619
and the pixel density, so the screen resolution.
214

214

00:10:50.619  -->  00:10:53.035
So let's take a look at that now.
215

215

00:10:53.035  -->  00:10:55.118
Reload this entire thing.
216

216

00:10:56.009  -->  00:10:59.017
And, well, maybe something weird is going on.
217

217

00:10:59.017  -->  00:11:01.038
Let's go back to that.
218

218

00:11:01.038  -->  00:11:04.205
All right, so let's inspect this here.
219

219

00:11:05.384  -->  00:11:06.410
And here we go.
220

220

00:11:06.410  -->  00:11:11.331
And again, I'm going to use, ah, here it is, properties.
221

221

00:11:11.331  -->  00:11:13.798
Just to take a look at the current source.
222

222

00:11:13.798  -->  00:11:15.190
And you see that it's already working.
223

223

00:11:15.190  -->  00:11:18.986
So it's using this small net three image here
224

224

00:11:18.986  -->  00:11:21.236
and here probably the same.
225

225

00:11:23.251  -->  00:11:24.560
So where is it?
226

226

00:11:24.560  -->  00:11:25.457
Ah, down here.
227

227

00:11:25.457  -->  00:11:28.094
So it's using this small net one image here
228

228

00:11:28.094  -->  00:11:31.396
because we have this smaller pixel density here.
229

229

00:11:31.396  -->  00:11:34.627
And so, we specified this image as being 300 pixels.
230

230

00:11:34.627  -->  00:11:36.769
And so, it's actually using the image
231

231

00:11:36.769  -->  00:11:39.283
which has a width of 300 pixels.
232

232

00:11:39.283  -->  00:11:41.183
Not the larger one, which actually has
233

233

00:11:41.183  -->  00:11:43.488
a width of 1,000 pixels.
234

234

00:11:43.488  -->  00:11:46.216
So if you change that to two,
235

235

00:11:46.216  -->  00:11:48.549
then it should use that one.
236

236

00:11:49.530  -->  00:11:51.280
So, let's check that.
237

237

00:11:53.806  -->  00:11:55.672
And, yeah, so right now it's using
238

238

00:11:55.672  -->  00:11:57.597
the net three large image.
239

239

00:11:57.597  -->  00:12:00.730
And the same thing for the other two, I'm sure.
240

240

00:12:00.730  -->  00:12:02.894
And, yeah, so now it's using the net one large.
241

241

00:12:02.894  -->  00:12:05.983
And that is because we have this higher pixel density.
242

242

00:12:05.983  -->  00:12:08.633
And therefore the browser chooses
243

243

00:12:08.633  -->  00:12:10.940
to use the larger image.
244

244

00:12:10.940  -->  00:12:13.566
Which actually has 1,000 pixels and width.
245

245

00:12:13.566  -->  00:12:15.126
But this is the image that it has to use
246

246

00:12:15.126  -->  00:12:17.672
if it wants to display two pixels of the image
247

247

00:12:17.672  -->  00:12:20.098
and one pixel in the design.
248

248

00:12:20.098  -->  00:12:23.330
So that's the philosophy behind the two x screen.
249

249

00:12:23.330  -->  00:12:25.045
So that's working already.
250

250

00:12:25.045  -->  00:12:29.212
And let's now move down to the smaller screen here.
251

251

00:12:31.532  -->  00:12:33.279
And I'm gonna reload.
252

252

00:12:33.279  -->  00:12:35.110
And so, let's take a look at what we have now,
253

253

00:12:35.110  -->  00:12:37.443
which image it is using now.
254

254

00:12:38.820  -->  00:12:41.753
And we're still using the net one large.
255

255

00:12:41.753  -->  00:12:43.539
Let's push that even further down,
256

256

00:12:43.539  -->  00:12:47.023
so really, really small here now.
257

257

00:12:47.023  -->  00:12:49.273
Let's make it even smaller.
258

258

00:12:50.112  -->  00:12:51.188
Reload.
259

259

00:12:51.188  -->  00:12:52.951
And so, let's see now.
260

260

00:12:52.951  -->  00:12:55.240
Because right now the image is really small, right?
261

261

00:12:55.240  -->  00:12:58.116
As you see, it's only 116 pixels wide.
262

262

00:12:58.116  -->  00:13:00.888
And so, now the net two image here
263

263

00:13:00.888  -->  00:13:03.601
would already be enough, okay,
264

264

00:13:03.601  -->  00:13:06.427
so let's take a look at that.
265

265

00:13:06.427  -->  00:13:08.937
And, actually, it says it's using the net two large.
266

266

00:13:08.937  -->  00:13:10.821
But I don't really believe that it is,
267

267

00:13:10.821  -->  00:13:13.067
because as I mentioned before, sometimes this doesn't
268

268

00:13:13.067  -->  00:13:16.689
really work really well, this device pixel ratio
269

269

00:13:16.689  -->  00:13:20.102
option here, sometimes it doesn't really work.
270

270

00:13:20.102  -->  00:13:21.927
So if you would test this in the real world,
271

271

00:13:21.927  -->  00:13:25.705
then I'm sure it would actually load this smaller image.
272

272

00:13:25.705  -->  00:13:28.362
Because it's such a small image in here
273

273

00:13:28.362  -->  00:13:30.682
that even with a higher pixel density here,
274

274

00:13:30.682  -->  00:13:33.317
the small image is more than enough to display
275

275

00:13:33.317  -->  00:13:35.984
all of that pixels that we want.
276

276

00:13:36.940  -->  00:13:40.267
Okay, so let's maybe put that to three.
277

277

00:13:40.267  -->  00:13:44.100
Sorry, put that to three, reload and increase.
278

278

00:13:48.235  -->  00:13:50.291
Put to two, then increase again,
279

279

00:13:50.291  -->  00:13:53.965
just to see if it changes that value.
280

280

00:13:53.965  -->  00:13:55.965
Okay, then reload again.
281

281

00:13:57.538  -->  00:14:00.546
So let's take a look at that now.
282

282

00:14:00.546  -->  00:14:02.161
And it still says large.
283

283

00:14:02.161  -->  00:14:03.667
Okay, it's not a problem because as I said,
284

284

00:14:03.667  -->  00:14:06.091
I'm sure that it's working the way it should.
285

285

00:14:06.091  -->  00:14:09.021
Maybe if you are seeing this on a one x screen, actually,
286

286

00:14:09.021  -->  00:14:11.218
so a lower density screen, then it will show you
287

287

00:14:11.218  -->  00:14:12.877
that it's using the net one.
288

288

00:14:12.877  -->  00:14:15.083
And so, that depends of course on your screen.
289

289

00:14:15.083  -->  00:14:17.198
I'm currently recording this video
290

290

00:14:17.198  -->  00:14:18.953
on a high density screen.
291

291

00:14:18.953  -->  00:14:21.338
And so, maybe that's the reason why it stays here
292

292

00:14:21.338  -->  00:14:24.421
at the large image, even if the small one
293

293

00:14:24.421  -->  00:14:25.810
would be more than enough.
294

294

00:14:25.810  -->  00:14:30.286
Okay, so I hope all of that made sense to you.
295

295

00:14:30.286  -->  00:14:33.143
And so, my challenge for you now is to actually go ahead
296

296

00:14:33.143  -->  00:14:35.721
and change the other images.
297

297

00:14:35.721  -->  00:14:38.638
So, for example, these images here.
298

298

00:14:40.577  -->  00:14:44.174
So these ones, and then also the ones we have here.
299

299

00:14:44.174  -->  00:14:47.332
So, I challenge you to create some smaller versions
300

300

00:14:47.332  -->  00:14:49.778
of these images and then play around with this technique
301

301

00:14:49.778  -->  00:14:52.340
that I just showed you in order to make all of these images
302

302

00:14:52.340  -->  00:14:54.911
responsive, because your users in the future,
303

303

00:14:54.911  -->  00:14:57.485
they will appreciate the extra effort,
304

304

00:14:57.485  -->  00:15:00.022
the extra mile that you go in order to make the website
305

305

00:15:00.022  -->  00:15:02.125
better for them and more responsive
306

306

00:15:02.125  -->  00:15:03.657
and more performant
307

307

00:15:03.657  -->  00:15:06.488
with the users with the smaller screen, for example,
308

308

00:15:06.488  -->  00:15:09.725
with the low data connection on their smart phone.
309

309

00:15:09.725  -->  00:15:12.082
And so, we have to think about all of these possibilities
310

310

00:15:12.082  -->  00:15:13.862
and not leaving responsive images
311

311

00:15:13.862  -->  00:15:15.706
just as an afterthought.
312

312

00:15:15.706  -->  00:15:17.979
So I showed it to you how it works.
313

313

00:15:17.979  -->  00:15:21.745
And so, again, I look forward for you to complete this
314

314

00:15:21.745  -->  00:15:24.877
with all the other images that we have on the page.
315

315

00:15:24.877  -->  00:15:27.494
Now, just to make sure that you really understood,
316

316

00:15:27.494  -->  00:15:29.772
let's just take 30 seconds and recap
317

317

00:15:29.772  -->  00:15:31.484
what we done here.
318

318

00:15:31.484  -->  00:15:33.994
So we have two versions of the same image.
319

319

00:15:33.994  -->  00:15:37.652
One has 300 pixels and one has 1,000 pixels,
320

320

00:15:37.652  -->  00:15:39.203
which is the large one.
321

321

00:15:39.203  -->  00:15:41.088
And so, in the source set attribute here,
322

322

00:15:41.088  -->  00:15:44.680
we specify the width descriptor and specify exactly
323

323

00:15:44.680  -->  00:15:47.831
the width in pixels that each image has.
324

324

00:15:47.831  -->  00:15:50.505
So this one 300, this one 1,000.
325

325

00:15:50.505  -->  00:15:53.495
Then next, we use the size attribute to specify
326

326

00:15:53.495  -->  00:15:56.509
the approximate view in view port width units
327

327

00:15:56.509  -->  00:15:58.088
for different breakpoints.
328

328

00:15:58.088  -->  00:15:59.625
And you could add even more if you wanted.
329

329

00:15:59.625  -->  00:16:01.313
That wouldn't be a problem at all.
330

330

00:16:01.313  -->  00:16:02.973
So, actually, the more, the better.
331

331

00:16:02.973  -->  00:16:04.408
The more precise the browser,
332

332

00:16:04.408  -->  00:16:06.245
we'll know which image to choose.
333

333

00:16:06.245  -->  00:16:09.887
And then finally if none of these breakpoints here apply,
334

334

00:16:09.887  -->  00:16:12.414
we just use our default here basically.
335

335

00:16:12.414  -->  00:16:13.585
And that is it.
336

336

00:16:13.585  -->  00:16:16.770
So, the browser as its loading the HTML document,
337

337

00:16:16.770  -->  00:16:18.891
it knows its current view port width,
338

338

00:16:18.891  -->  00:16:22.418
and it knows its current pixel density of the screen.
339

339

00:16:22.418  -->  00:16:24.642
And having in mind all the information here
340

340

00:16:24.642  -->  00:16:26.836
that we provided, it then can choose
341

341

00:16:26.836  -->  00:16:29.068
which image to download.
342

342

00:16:29.068  -->  00:16:31.455
And that's the entire philosophy behind this
343

343

00:16:31.455  -->  00:16:33.587
resolution switching method.
344

344

00:16:33.587  -->  00:16:36.564
Now, just to compare it again with the art direction,
345

345

00:16:36.564  -->  00:16:39.981
let's come back here again to the footer.
346

346

00:16:42.303  -->  00:16:44.413
So here, it is a bit different.
347

347

00:16:44.413  -->  00:16:46.671
So what we do here is to basically force
348

348

00:16:46.671  -->  00:16:49.146
the browser to use this image here
349

349

00:16:49.146  -->  00:16:53.398
that we give it here in case that this media query applies.
350

350

00:16:53.398  -->  00:16:55.472
And so, the browser doesn't really have a choice,
351

351

00:16:55.472  -->  00:16:59.072
which is actually exactly what we want for art direction.
352

352

00:16:59.072  -->  00:17:03.627
So that's actually it for responsive images in HTML.
353

353

00:17:03.627  -->  00:17:06.668
I hope that made sense to you, and if you have any questions
354

354

00:17:06.668  -->  00:17:09.418
about this, make sure to post them in the Q and A section
355

355

00:17:09.418  -->  00:17:11.991
on Udemy, and you're gonna get help there.
356

356

00:17:11.991  -->  00:17:13.806
And then go ahead and change all of the images
357

357

00:17:13.806  -->  00:17:16.723
of this page to responsive images.
