00:00:00.641  -->  00:00:02.662
<v Jonas>Let's continue working</v>
2

2

00:00:02.662  -->  00:00:04.273
on our grid example
3

3

00:00:04.273  -->  00:00:06.477
and learn how we can position items
4

4

00:00:06.477  -->  00:00:08.894
wherever we want on the grid.
5

5

00:00:09.842  -->  00:00:10.853
So right now,
6

6

00:00:10.853  -->  00:00:12.443
all of our grid items
7

7

00:00:12.443  -->  00:00:15.209
are laid out according to their source order.
8

8

00:00:15.209  -->  00:00:17.795
So we start here in the beginning.
9

9

00:00:17.795  -->  00:00:18.826
And then one, two,
10

10

00:00:18.826  -->  00:00:19.845
three, four,
11

11

00:00:19.845  -->  00:00:21.164
five, and six.
12

12

00:00:21.164  -->  00:00:23.377
And that is because of CSS grid's
13

13

00:00:23.377  -->  00:00:25.292
automatic placement algorithm.
14

14

00:00:25.292  -->  00:00:26.822
And so the default behavior
15

15

00:00:26.822  -->  00:00:28.290
is that the items are laid out
16

16

00:00:28.290  -->  00:00:30.096
just like they are in the code,
17

17

00:00:30.096  -->  00:00:31.934
which actually makes a lot of sense.
18

18

00:00:31.934  -->  00:00:34.302
But now imagine that you actually have to place
19

19

00:00:34.302  -->  00:00:36.550
a grid item somewhere else.
20

20

00:00:36.550  -->  00:00:38.871
So let's position this first one here,
21

21

00:00:38.871  -->  00:00:40.833
orange one, right here.
22

22

00:00:40.833  -->  00:00:42.917
So right here in this grid cell.
23

23

00:00:42.917  -->  00:00:45.187
So remember what a grid cell is.
24

24

00:00:45.187  -->  00:00:46.682
It is the area between
25

25

00:00:46.682  -->  00:00:49.995
two adjacent row and column lines, right.
26

26

00:00:49.995  -->  00:00:52.262
So here we have the column line number two,
27

27

00:00:52.262  -->  00:00:54.314
and our number three.
28

28

00:00:54.314  -->  00:00:56.859
And here we have the row line number two,
29

29

00:00:56.859  -->  00:00:58.548
and row line number three.
30

30

00:00:58.548  -->  00:00:59.953
And so this area here
31

31

00:00:59.953  -->  00:01:01.916
is called a cell.
32

32

00:01:01.916  -->  00:01:03.301
So what we want to do now
33

33

00:01:03.301  -->  00:01:05.155
is to put this item here,
34

34

00:01:05.155  -->  00:01:06.629
this grid item, number one
35

35

00:01:06.629  -->  00:01:08.462
into this cell, right.
36

36

00:01:09.617  -->  00:01:11.363
And how can we do that?
37

37

00:01:11.363  -->  00:01:13.793
Well that's where these numbers here
38

38

00:01:13.793  -->  00:01:16.114
actually come into play.
39

39

00:01:16.114  -->  00:01:18.853
So the column and the row line numbers.
40

40

00:01:18.853  -->  00:01:22.724
So let's come here to our item number one
41

41

00:01:22.724  -->  00:01:25.173
and let's define a couple of properties.
42

42

00:01:25.173  -->  00:01:26.775
So we start with
43

43

00:01:26.775  -->  00:01:28.025
grid-row-start.
44

44

00:01:30.840  -->  00:01:32.839
And so that's the number of the row line
45

45

00:01:32.839  -->  00:01:34.891
in which we want this to start.
46

46

00:01:34.891  -->  00:01:35.971
So right now,
47

47

00:01:35.971  -->  00:01:37.642
remember we want to put
48

48

00:01:37.642  -->  00:01:39.515
this item here in this cell.
49

49

00:01:39.515  -->  00:01:42.592
And so it starts here at line number two.
50

50

00:01:42.592  -->  00:01:44.282
And so we simply put two.
51

51

00:01:44.282  -->  00:01:45.282
All right.
52

52

00:01:45.282  -->  00:01:46.584
And you already saw
53

53

00:01:46.584  -->  00:01:50.135
that the element moved here to the second row, right.
54

54

00:01:50.135  -->  00:01:52.491
So without even doing anything else.
55

55

00:01:52.491  -->  00:01:54.658
But we can do grid-row-end
56

56

00:01:57.644  -->  00:01:59.106
and set it to three.
57

57

00:01:59.106  -->  00:02:01.684
So that's then a cleaner solution.
58

58

00:02:01.684  -->  00:02:02.949
So with this code here,
59

59

00:02:02.949  -->  00:02:04.225
we say that the item
60

60

00:02:04.225  -->  00:02:05.724
should be placed in a cell
61

61

00:02:05.724  -->  00:02:08.075
which starts by row line number two
62

62

00:02:08.075  -->  00:02:11.498
and ends at row line number three.
63

63

00:02:11.498  -->  00:02:12.644
Okay, and so already,
64

64

00:02:12.644  -->  00:02:15.686
this item moved here to the second row.
65

65

00:02:15.686  -->  00:02:18.513
And then the other items move up in the same order
66

66

00:02:18.513  -->  00:02:19.880
in which they were before.
67

67

00:02:19.880  -->  00:02:21.338
So two, three, four,
68

68

00:02:21.338  -->  00:02:23.064
and then a number one,
69

69

00:02:23.064  -->  00:02:24.343
and then five and six.
70

70

00:02:24.343  -->  00:02:27.692
So that's again, the automatic placement algorithm here.
71

71

00:02:27.692  -->  00:02:28.805
Now next,
72

72

00:02:28.805  -->  00:02:30.644
and you can probably already guess,
73

73

00:02:30.644  -->  00:02:32.394
is grid-column-start.
74

74

00:02:36.528  -->  00:02:38.781
Okay, and so that's the number two as well.
75

75

00:02:38.781  -->  00:02:40.114
So a number two,
76

76

00:02:41.604  -->  00:02:43.459
and here we go.
77

77

00:02:43.459  -->  00:02:45.617
So now it's exactly in the cell
78

78

00:02:45.617  -->  00:02:47.367
that we wanted it to.
79

79

00:02:48.338  -->  00:02:50.671
Just to finish this one here
80

80

00:02:51.933  -->  00:02:54.353
and number three as well.
81

81

00:02:54.353  -->  00:02:57.612
So it starts at row line number two and three
82

82

00:02:57.612  -->  00:03:00.779
and also at column line number two and three.
83

83

00:03:00.779  -->  00:03:04.844
And so now we've placed our item exactly in this grid cell.
84

84

00:03:04.844  -->  00:03:07.133
Now this is a lot of code here to write.
85

85

00:03:07.133  -->  00:03:11.562
And so there's actually a bit easier way to do it.
86

86

00:03:11.562  -->  00:03:15.679
So let's just comment it here for the moment.
87

87

00:03:15.679  -->  00:03:16.680
And instead,
88

88

00:03:16.680  -->  00:03:19.097
we can simply write grid-row,
89

89

00:03:20.197  -->  00:03:22.030
and then two and three.
90

90

00:03:22.030  -->  00:03:23.903
And so this is where it starts
91

91

00:03:23.903  -->  00:03:25.314
and where it ends.
92

92

00:03:25.314  -->  00:03:26.754
Okay, so this is like a shorthand
93

93

00:03:26.754  -->  00:03:28.799
for these two properties.
94

94

00:03:28.799  -->  00:03:31.732
And then the same with the column,
95

95

00:03:31.732  -->  00:03:32.732
grid-column,
96

96

00:03:34.055  -->  00:03:35.888
two and three as well.
97

97

00:03:36.895  -->  00:03:39.671
And so here we are back to the cell.
98

98

00:03:39.671  -->  00:03:41.687
Okay, and now that you know how it works,
99

99

00:03:41.687  -->  00:03:43.791
let's do the same for another one.
100

100

00:03:43.791  -->  00:03:46.830
So let's position this number five item here
101

101

00:03:46.830  -->  00:03:49.442
into this grid cell here.
102

102

00:03:49.442  -->  00:03:51.276
So how do we do that?
103

103

00:03:51.276  -->  00:03:54.276
Well, let's come here to number five
104

104

00:03:55.417  -->  00:03:57.596
and then grid-row.
105

105

00:03:57.596  -->  00:03:59.411
And which one is it now?
106

106

00:03:59.411  -->  00:04:01.914
So remember right now it's here in the second row.
107

107

00:04:01.914  -->  00:04:03.395
So between two and three.
108

108

00:04:03.395  -->  00:04:05.115
But we want it to be between
109

109

00:04:05.115  -->  00:04:06.115
two and one.
110

110

00:04:07.220  -->  00:04:08.660
And two and one.
111

111

00:04:08.660  -->  00:04:09.903
And that's it.
112

112

00:04:09.903  -->  00:04:11.487
And now it moves of course here
113

113

00:04:11.487  -->  00:04:12.925
to the first position.
114

114

00:04:12.925  -->  00:04:16.311
Because we haven't yet specified the column.
115

115

00:04:16.311  -->  00:04:17.478
So grid-column
116

116

00:04:18.990  -->  00:04:20.157
three and four
117

117

00:04:21.456  -->  00:04:24.574
as you can see here from these line number indicators.
118

118

00:04:24.574  -->  00:04:26.029
And so that's why I was saying
119

119

00:04:26.029  -->  00:04:27.933
that it's so important and so useful
120

120

00:04:27.933  -->  00:04:30.237
to having these line numbers here
121

121

00:04:30.237  -->  00:04:31.514
right with the dev tools.
122

122

00:04:31.514  -->  00:04:33.118
So here with the inspector.
123

123

00:04:33.118  -->  00:04:34.865
And that's just something that Google Chrome
124

124

00:04:34.865  -->  00:04:36.323
doesn't do at the moment.
125

125

00:04:36.323  -->  00:04:38.211
It probably will do sometime in the future.
126

126

00:04:38.211  -->  00:04:40.860
But right now, only Firefox does this.
127

127

00:04:40.860  -->  00:04:43.232
And that's exactly why we're using it.
128

128

00:04:43.232  -->  00:04:45.390
Now if writing these two properties here
129

129

00:04:45.390  -->  00:04:46.922
is still too much for you,
130

130

00:04:46.922  -->  00:04:50.505
you can actually do it in also another way.
131

131

00:04:51.392  -->  00:04:54.121
So let's comment this out again.
132

132

00:04:54.121  -->  00:04:56.872
And remember how grid-row and grid-column
133

133

00:04:56.872  -->  00:05:00.262
are just a shorthand for grid-row-start,
134

134

00:05:00.262  -->  00:05:01.338
grid-row-end,
135

135

00:05:01.338  -->  00:05:02.345
column-start,
136

136

00:05:02.345  -->  00:05:03.354
and column-end.
137

137

00:05:03.354  -->  00:05:04.951
But there's actually a shorthand
138

138

00:05:04.951  -->  00:05:06.880
even for these two.
139

139

00:05:06.880  -->  00:05:09.547
So we can say grid-area instead.
140

140

00:05:10.463  -->  00:05:12.817
And then here we specify the line number
141

141

00:05:12.817  -->  00:05:15.176
where we want it to start,
142

142

00:05:15.176  -->  00:05:17.914
then the column number where we want it to start.
143

143

00:05:17.914  -->  00:05:20.559
So that would be here, the number three, right.
144

144

00:05:20.559  -->  00:05:23.166
And then the line where it ends
145

145

00:05:23.166  -->  00:05:24.916
and the column where it ends.
146

146

00:05:24.916  -->  00:05:27.452
So I think this is a bit confusing actually.
147

147

00:05:27.452  -->  00:05:29.956
And so I personally do prefer
148

148

00:05:29.956  -->  00:05:32.297
this way here of writing it out, okay.
149

149

00:05:32.297  -->  00:05:33.306
And so in the future,
150

150

00:05:33.306  -->  00:05:35.141
this is how I'm going to do it
151

151

00:05:35.141  -->  00:05:37.353
instead of using the grid-area property.
152

152

00:05:37.353  -->  00:05:38.610
But I just wanted to show you
153

153

00:05:38.610  -->  00:05:39.991
that there is another way.
154

154

00:05:39.991  -->  00:05:42.948
And there are actually more ways of positioning items.
155

155

00:05:42.948  -->  00:05:45.052
But this one is the most straightforward
156

156

00:05:45.052  -->  00:05:47.287
and the most easy to use, okay.
157

157

00:05:47.287  -->  00:05:48.404
So again,
158

158

00:05:48.404  -->  00:05:50.814
there will be other ways of positioning items
159

159

00:05:50.814  -->  00:05:52.957
that I'm gonna show you later in the course.
160

160

00:05:52.957  -->  00:05:54.072
But for now,
161

161

00:05:54.072  -->  00:05:56.426
please just know that this is the easiest way.
162

162

00:05:56.426  -->  00:05:59.993
And this is the one that I want you to understand right now.
163

163

00:05:59.993  -->  00:06:01.557
Okay, and also you can understand this
164

164

00:06:01.557  -->  00:06:02.731
even a bit better.
165

165

00:06:02.731  -->  00:06:04.442
I want you to position one of these items
166

166

00:06:04.442  -->  00:06:05.698
all by yourself
167

167

00:06:05.698  -->  00:06:08.002
without looking at the code, okay.
168

168

00:06:08.002  -->  00:06:10.032
So let's scroll down here a bit.
169

169

00:06:10.032  -->  00:06:11.579
And now without looking at the code,
170

170

00:06:11.579  -->  00:06:15.216
I want you to position this number six item right here.
171

171

00:06:15.216  -->  00:06:16.368
Okay.
172

172

00:06:16.368  -->  00:06:17.703
So you think you can do that?
173

173

00:06:17.703  -->  00:06:19.590
Well, just pause the video,
174

174

00:06:19.590  -->  00:06:21.500
and please try to do it on your own
175

175

00:06:21.500  -->  00:06:24.506
without looking at the code.
176

176

00:06:24.506  -->  00:06:26.088
Okay, so you managed to do that.
177

177

00:06:26.088  -->  00:06:28.088
So here is the solution.
178

178

00:06:30.246  -->  00:06:33.496
So grid-row is just one and two, right.
179

179

00:06:35.663  -->  00:06:38.089
And so you already see it now moving up
180

180

00:06:38.089  -->  00:06:39.295
to the first line.
181

181

00:06:39.295  -->  00:06:42.014
And now for the column,
182

182

00:06:42.014  -->  00:06:43.507
grid-column,
183

183

00:06:43.507  -->  00:06:44.757
and two, three.
184

184

00:06:45.919  -->  00:06:47.169
And here we go.
185

185

00:06:48.476  -->  00:06:50.272
So now you know how to position these items
186

186

00:06:50.272  -->  00:06:52.904
exactly where you want them.
187

187

00:06:52.904  -->  00:06:53.903
But that's more.
188

188

00:06:53.903  -->  00:06:56.013
We can actually do a lot more, okay.
189

189

00:06:56.013  -->  00:06:58.229
So we can expand these elements here, for example,
190

190

00:06:58.229  -->  00:07:01.847
over multiple rows or multiple columns.
191

191

00:07:01.847  -->  00:07:04.293
So imagine we wanted to have this blue element here
192

192

00:07:04.293  -->  00:07:07.530
spanning all over these two cells here.
193

193

00:07:07.530  -->  00:07:09.333
So this entire area.
194

194

00:07:09.333  -->  00:07:10.539
We can do that of course
195

195

00:07:10.539  -->  00:07:11.849
also with grids.
196

196

00:07:11.849  -->  00:07:13.725
And it's actually something really, really important.
197

197

00:07:13.725  -->  00:07:14.558
So without that,
198

198

00:07:14.558  -->  00:07:17.319
grids actually wouldn't make much sense.
199

199

00:07:17.319  -->  00:07:18.813
So if you want to learn how to do that,
200

200

00:07:18.813  -->  00:07:21.896
then just click on that next lecture.
