1

00:00:01,463  -->  00:00:03,419
<v Instructor>Let's now finally code up</v>
2

2

00:00:03,419  -->  00:00:07,573
the background video of the story section.
3

3

00:00:07,573  -->  00:00:09,073
So, we have this video here
4

4

00:00:09,073  -->  00:00:12,196
basically spanning this entire section here.
5

5

00:00:12,196  -->  00:00:14,135
So, from the beginning of the section
6

6

00:00:14,135  -->  00:00:15,923
all the way until the end.
7

7

00:00:15,923  -->  00:00:19,614
And it also works no matter what the screen width, okay?
8

8

00:00:19,614  -->  00:00:21,647
So, on all screen width
9

9

00:00:21,647  -->  00:00:23,446
the video simply stays here,
10

10

00:00:23,446  -->  00:00:26,268
spanning over the entire section, okay?
11

11

00:00:26,268  -->  00:00:27,963
So, let's now do that.
12

12

00:00:27,963  -->  00:00:30,529
And we start, as always, in the HTML.
13

13

00:00:30,529  -->  00:00:34,116
So, how are we going to approach this background video?
14

14

00:00:34,116  -->  00:00:35,614
Well, what we're gonna do is
15

15

00:00:35,614  -->  00:00:39,178
to add an element to this section, of course,
16

16

00:00:39,178  -->  00:00:42,464
and make it the exact same size as the section,
17

17

00:00:42,464  -->  00:00:46,203
and then put the video in that container, okay?
18

18

00:00:46,203  -->  00:00:47,703
So, let's do that.
19

19

00:00:50,471  -->  00:00:51,951
So, I'm gonna call this background video.
20

20

00:00:51,951  -->  00:00:53,784
So, bg for background.
21

21

00:00:55,470  -->  00:00:57,049
And that's a container.
22

22

00:00:57,049  -->  00:00:59,359
And now in here is where we actually will use
23

23

00:00:59,359  -->  00:01:00,859
the video element.
24

24

00:01:01,820  -->  00:01:04,325
So, in HTML5 there's a video element
25

25

00:01:04,325  -->  00:01:07,298
which allows us to embed videos on a webpage.
26

26

00:01:07,298  -->  00:01:09,074
So, video, and I'm gonna call it
27

27

00:01:09,074  -->  00:01:09,907
bg
28

28

00:01:12,418  -->  00:01:13,835
and then content.
29

29

00:01:14,809  -->  00:01:19,117
So, we're still following the BEM methodology here.
30

30

00:01:19,117  -->  00:01:21,798
Now, this is how videos work.
31

31

00:01:21,798  -->  00:01:25,583
So, we will not specify this source tag there,
32

32

00:01:25,583  -->  00:01:27,580
but instead what we're gonna do
33

33

00:01:27,580  -->  00:01:30,982
is to specify something called the source in here.
34

34

00:01:30,982  -->  00:01:32,595
So, again, instead of using
35

35

00:01:32,595  -->  00:01:35,614
the src attribute here in the video tag
36

36

00:01:35,614  -->  00:01:37,319
like we would do with an image,
37

37

00:01:37,319  -->  00:01:39,282
there's actually a source tag in HTML
38

38

00:01:39,282  -->  00:01:41,419
which allows us to embed a video file
39

39

00:01:41,419  -->  00:01:44,241
into this video element, okay?
40

40

00:01:44,241  -->  00:01:48,408
So, source, and then here we have the source attribute
41

41

00:01:49,934  -->  00:01:52,479
that we had in the images as well.
42

42

00:01:52,479  -->  00:01:55,418
So, let's take a look at our images folder,
43

43

00:01:55,418  -->  00:01:56,892
because that's where the video is.
44

44

00:01:56,892  -->  00:01:59,479
And actually, there are two formats.
45

45

00:01:59,479  -->  00:02:01,455
So, we have one in the mp4 format
46

46

00:02:01,455  -->  00:02:04,705
and one in the webm format, okay?
47

47

00:02:04,705  -->  00:02:07,122
So, img/video.mp4.
48

48

00:02:10,023  -->  00:02:12,786
And so I should say that this is a type video
49

49

00:02:12,786  -->  00:02:13,869
and then mp4.
50

50

00:02:16,594  -->  00:02:18,344
And then another one.
51

51

00:02:20,693  -->  00:02:23,235
Source, src attribute,
52

52

00:02:23,235  -->  00:02:27,235
and now img/video, and the other one.
53

53

00:02:28,831  -->  00:02:32,664
And then type, video of the format webm, okay?
54

54

00:02:35,203  -->  00:02:38,967
Now, I got these videos from a very handy website
55

55

00:02:38,967  -->  00:02:40,674
which is called coverr.
56

56

00:02:40,674  -->  00:02:43,727
So, coverr with two R's, dot C O.
57

57

00:02:43,727  -->  00:02:45,736
And so, here you can download
58

58

00:02:45,736  -->  00:02:49,811
all kinds of different videos for your websites.
59

59

00:02:49,811  -->  00:02:52,667
And they are of course all free to use.
60

60

00:02:52,667  -->  00:02:54,664
And so when you download the video from here
61

61

00:02:54,664  -->  00:02:56,575
it already comes in these two versions.
62

62

00:02:56,575  -->  00:02:58,839
So, the mp4 and webm.
63

63

00:02:58,839  -->  00:03:00,174
And we need these two formats
64

64

00:03:00,174  -->  00:03:01,972
in order to make absolutely sure
65

65

00:03:01,972  -->  00:03:04,087
that they work across all of the browsers.
66

66

00:03:04,087  -->  00:03:05,840
At least all of the modern browsers.
67

67

00:03:05,840  -->  00:03:07,965
Of course, this is not gonna work in a
68

68

00:03:07,965  -->  00:03:10,426
Internet Explorer 8 or 9 or something like that,
69

69

00:03:10,426  -->  00:03:12,876
but again, most of the things that I'm showing you here
70

70

00:03:12,876  -->  00:03:15,206
are not working on those very old browsers
71

71

00:03:15,206  -->  00:03:17,612
that shouldn't be used anymore anyway.
72

72

00:03:17,612  -->  00:03:19,235
And now, what we usually also do
73

73

00:03:19,235  -->  00:03:21,708
is to then put some text here,
74

74

00:03:21,708  -->  00:03:24,875
like, "Your browser is not supported!"
75

75

00:03:26,308  -->  00:03:27,481
Because what will happen
76

76

00:03:27,481  -->  00:03:30,859
if none of these can be played by the browser,
77

77

00:03:30,859  -->  00:03:32,868
then this text here will show
78

78

00:03:32,868  -->  00:03:35,109
in the browser instead of the video.
79

79

00:03:35,109  -->  00:03:36,827
And so, if the mp4 cannot be played
80

80

00:03:36,827  -->  00:03:38,522
and the webm cannot be played,
81

81

00:03:38,522  -->  00:03:40,531
like in a very old Internet Explorer,
82

82

00:03:40,531  -->  00:03:43,108
then this text here will appear.
83

83

00:03:43,108  -->  00:03:45,473
Next, what we can also do, and what we should do,
84

84

00:03:45,473  -->  00:03:49,290
is to add some commands here, basically, to this video.
85

85

00:03:49,290  -->  00:03:51,298
So, we can like specify attributes
86

86

00:03:51,298  -->  00:03:52,911
for the video that we're implementing.
87

87

00:03:52,911  -->  00:03:55,803
So, we can say, for example, autoplay.
88

88

00:03:55,803  -->  00:03:59,205
And so now, this video will start playing automatically.
89

89

00:03:59,205  -->  00:04:01,898
Now, autoplay is usually seen as a bad thing,
90

90

00:04:01,898  -->  00:04:04,278
but in this case, since it's a background video,
91

91

00:04:04,278  -->  00:04:07,193
and since we're also putting it muted.
92

92

00:04:07,193  -->  00:04:09,306
Okay, so no sound on the video.
93

93

00:04:09,306  -->  00:04:12,115
This is another property that we can specify here.
94

94

00:04:12,115  -->  00:04:14,008
Alright, and so, since it's muted,
95

95

00:04:14,008  -->  00:04:17,142
it's not really a problem to having it on autoplay.
96

96

00:04:17,142  -->  00:04:19,499
Something else we can do here, like another option,
97

97

00:04:19,499  -->  00:04:21,496
is to say loop, because otherwise
98

98

00:04:21,496  -->  00:04:23,864
it's not going to loop, okay?
99

99

00:04:23,864  -->  00:04:26,800
So, these are the three commands that we should put here.
100

100

00:04:26,800  -->  00:04:28,462
So, the three options, basically.
101

101

00:04:28,462  -->  00:04:32,850
So, let's now take a look at what we got here.
102

102

00:04:32,850  -->  00:04:34,534
And so, indeed, here it is.
103

103

00:04:34,534  -->  00:04:36,113
It's not yet a background video, of course,
104

104

00:04:36,113  -->  00:04:38,933
we didn't format that yet.
105

105

00:04:38,933  -->  00:04:42,310
But at least the video, you see it is implemented by now.
106

106

00:04:42,310  -->  00:04:44,867
And it's bigger than the screen size also,
107

107

00:04:44,867  -->  00:04:46,606
so we should take care of that.
108

108

00:04:46,606  -->  00:04:49,131
And then we should also position it exactly
109

109

00:04:49,131  -->  00:04:51,266
where we want it to be.
110

110

00:04:51,266  -->  00:04:54,683
And let's actually start with that, okay?
111

111

00:04:55,993  -->  00:04:57,076
So, bg-video.
112

112

00:04:58,292  -->  00:04:59,325
And what I'm gonna do here is
113

113

00:04:59,325  -->  00:05:02,042
to actually create a brand new component.
114

114

00:05:02,042  -->  00:05:03,493
And that's because, once again,
115

115

00:05:03,493  -->  00:05:05,860
we may want to reuse the component
116

116

00:05:05,860  -->  00:05:08,564
on some other place of the website, alright?
117

117

00:05:08,564  -->  00:05:10,250
So, this doesn't have to be the only place
118

118

00:05:10,250  -->  00:05:11,771
where we have a background video.
119

119

00:05:11,771  -->  00:05:13,280
And if we can have another one,
120

120

00:05:13,280  -->  00:05:14,627
well then that should mean
121

121

00:05:14,627  -->  00:05:17,668
that it's basically a component.
122

122

00:05:17,668  -->  00:05:19,168
So, bg-video here.
123

123

00:05:23,369  -->  00:05:25,236
Forgot the underscore.
124

124

00:05:25,236  -->  00:05:27,468
And okay, so _bg-video,
125

125

00:05:27,468  -->  00:05:29,968
and I also have to, as always,
126

126

00:05:31,438  -->  00:05:33,105
you find it in here.
127

127

00:05:36,256  -->  00:05:37,089
bg-video.
128

128

00:05:39,287  -->  00:05:40,120
Alright.
129

129

00:05:41,481  -->  00:05:42,564
So, bg-video.
130

130

00:05:44,836  -->  00:05:46,415
And as I was saying in the beginning,
131

131

00:05:46,415  -->  00:05:49,910
we will position this one using absolute positioning.
132

132

00:05:49,910  -->  00:05:51,410
Position absolute.
133

133

00:05:55,775  -->  00:05:57,442
Top zero, left zero.
134

134

00:05:59,476  -->  00:06:00,452
And then we want the heights
135

135

00:06:00,452  -->  00:06:02,495
to be exactly the one of the parent,
136

136

00:06:02,495  -->  00:06:05,245
and the same thing for the width,
137

137

00:06:06,570  -->  00:06:07,798
100%.
138

138

00:06:07,798  -->  00:06:10,912
Okay, so that is just the container.
139

139

00:06:10,912  -->  00:06:12,687
Now, what I have to do then also
140

140

00:06:12,687  -->  00:06:15,973
is to set the parent here, so section-stories,
141

141

00:06:15,973  -->  00:06:18,550
to position relative, right?
142

142

00:06:18,550  -->  00:06:20,384
So, it's here in home.
143

143

00:06:20,384  -->  00:06:23,051
And let's say position relative.
144

144

00:06:26,271  -->  00:06:27,304
So, let's take a look now
145

145

00:06:27,304  -->  00:06:28,428
at how this works.
146

146

00:06:28,428  -->  00:06:31,251
And whoa, great, so it's already actually
147

147

00:06:31,251  -->  00:06:33,225
behind our elements here.
148

148

00:06:33,225  -->  00:06:34,549
So, great, right?
149

149

00:06:34,549  -->  00:06:37,823
Well, actually not behind all of them.
150

150

00:06:37,823  -->  00:06:40,145
So, you see the button and the h3,
151

151

00:06:40,145  -->  00:06:41,651
they are hidden behind that.
152

152

00:06:41,651  -->  00:06:43,883
Okay, and so we can take care of that
153

153

00:06:43,883  -->  00:06:47,470
by simply setting a very low z-index.
154

154

00:06:47,470  -->  00:06:49,628
And it can even be negative.
155

155

00:06:49,628  -->  00:06:50,461
And so we can be sure
156

156

00:06:50,461  -->  00:06:54,611
that it will be behind all of the other elements, right?
157

157

00:06:54,611  -->  00:06:55,897
Let's take a look again.
158

158

00:06:55,897  -->  00:06:57,943
Oh, and actually it's now,
159

159

00:06:57,943  -->  00:06:59,345
like also hidden
160

160

00:06:59,345  -->  00:07:01,101
behind the section as well.
161

161

00:07:01,101  -->  00:07:02,985
And that's because we still
162

162

00:07:02,985  -->  00:07:06,125
have that background color going on there,
163

163

00:07:06,125  -->  00:07:07,169
which we don't want.
164

164

00:07:07,169  -->  00:07:09,143
And so now, basically it's transparent,
165

165

00:07:09,143  -->  00:07:11,033
and then it should be visible.
166

166

00:07:11,033  -->  00:07:12,950
And indeed, here we go.
167

167

00:07:14,031  -->  00:07:16,097
Now, the next thing that we also wanna do
168

168

00:07:16,097  -->  00:07:18,060
is to actually give it some opacity.
169

169

00:07:18,060  -->  00:07:20,486
So, we don't want to see the video like this,
170

170

00:07:20,486  -->  00:07:21,810
like with all these colors.
171

171

00:07:21,810  -->  00:07:24,551
It should just be very subtle effect
172

172

00:07:24,551  -->  00:07:25,834
in the background there.
173

173

00:07:25,834  -->  00:07:27,444
So, let's give it some opacity
174

174

00:07:27,444  -->  00:07:29,999
so that we can just see it like
175

175

00:07:29,999  -->  00:07:32,577
really just a little bit, okay?
176

176

00:07:32,577  -->  00:07:34,213
So, something like this.
177

177

00:07:34,213  -->  00:07:36,036
And that's already getting pretty close
178

178

00:07:36,036  -->  00:07:38,251
to what we had in the original.
179

179

00:07:38,251  -->  00:07:39,868
Now, another thing that we have here going on
180

180

00:07:39,868  -->  00:07:42,034
is that this one is not really opaque
181

181

00:07:42,034  -->  00:07:43,764
like it is here in the example.
182

182

00:07:43,764  -->  00:07:44,597
So, you see that here
183

183

00:07:44,597  -->  00:07:47,212
you can actually look through this element.
184

184

00:07:47,212  -->  00:07:48,350
And so, let's do that.
185

185

00:07:48,350  -->  00:07:50,997
So, we have to change the background color here.
186

186

00:07:50,997  -->  00:07:53,859
We cannot just say opacity 50% or something
187

187

00:07:53,859  -->  00:07:55,119
like we did with the video
188

188

00:07:55,119  -->  00:07:56,358
because then everything,
189

189

00:07:56,358  -->  00:07:57,879
so including the content,
190

190

00:07:57,879  -->  00:07:59,897
would also get this opacity.
191

191

00:07:59,897  -->  00:08:03,296
And we only really want this background to be like that.
192

192

00:08:03,296  -->  00:08:06,296
So, here let's go back to the story.
193

193

00:08:08,199  -->  00:08:10,324
And so, where is it, actually?
194

194

00:08:10,324  -->  00:08:11,157
Ah, here.
195

195

00:08:12,449  -->  00:08:13,699
So, we use rgba
196

196

00:08:16,338  -->  00:08:19,088
and then let's say like 60%.
197

197

00:08:21,633  -->  00:08:24,466
So, that looks much nicer I think.
198

198

00:08:25,427  -->  00:08:27,526
And so now we have to fix this problem
199

199

00:08:27,526  -->  00:08:29,781
that the video is overflowing.
200

200

00:08:29,781  -->  00:08:31,987
So, it's taking its entire width,
201

201

00:08:31,987  -->  00:08:34,390
and it's also not really filling this entire section, right?
202

202

00:08:34,390  -->  00:08:35,923
Because the section goes
203

203

00:08:35,923  -->  00:08:39,278
all the way until down here, I believe.
204

204

00:08:39,278  -->  00:08:40,509
Yes, indeed.
205

205

00:08:40,509  -->  00:08:43,212
And so, of course we want to fill the entire section,
206

206

00:08:43,212  -->  00:08:45,455
and we also don't want it to be
207

207

00:08:45,455  -->  00:08:49,341
outside of our webpage like this, obviously.
208

208

00:08:49,341  -->  00:08:52,687
So, there's a very good way to do that.
209

209

00:08:52,687  -->  00:08:55,104
And so let me show it to you.
210

210

00:08:57,227  -->  00:09:00,894
So, we need to select now that video itself.
211

211

00:09:03,648  -->  00:09:06,260
Content, and let's start by saying
212

212

00:09:06,260  -->  00:09:10,427
that we actually want it to be 100% high and 100% wide,
213

213

00:09:12,959  -->  00:09:15,941
but that alone is not going to fix it.
214

214

00:09:15,941  -->  00:09:19,178
So, let me show you why that is.
215

215

00:09:19,178  -->  00:09:23,290
Okay, so now the width is 100% of the section,
216

216

00:09:23,290  -->  00:09:26,529
but it's now covering even less of our section.
217

217

00:09:26,529  -->  00:09:27,980
And that's because this, of course,
218

218

00:09:27,980  -->  00:09:31,161
maintains the aspect ratio of this video.
219

219

00:09:31,161  -->  00:09:32,903
So, if it was wider before,
220

220

00:09:32,903  -->  00:09:35,179
then of course it also was higher.
221

221

00:09:35,179  -->  00:09:38,371
So, it could occupy more of our section here.
222

222

00:09:38,371  -->  00:09:40,205
So, what do we do to actually occupy
223

223

00:09:40,205  -->  00:09:41,587
this entire section here,
224

224

00:09:41,587  -->  00:09:44,873
but also while maintaining the aspect ratio?
225

225

00:09:44,873  -->  00:09:47,821
And there is, of course, once again
226

226

00:09:47,821  -->  00:09:49,961
a quite new property which allows us
227

227

00:09:49,961  -->  00:09:52,260
to do exactly that with CSS.
228

228

00:09:52,260  -->  00:09:54,245
And it's called object-fit.
229

229

00:09:54,245  -->  00:09:57,298
And when we set object-fit to cover,
230

230

00:09:57,298  -->  00:09:59,110
then this is actually pretty similar
231

231

00:09:59,110  -->  00:10:01,279
to the background size cover,
232

232

00:10:01,279  -->  00:10:04,810
which we do all the time with the background images, right?
233

233

00:10:04,810  -->  00:10:08,421
So, what object-fit cover will do is that the element,
234

234

00:10:08,421  -->  00:10:10,006
and so in this case, the video,
235

235

00:10:10,006  -->  00:10:11,881
will fill the entire parent
236

236

00:10:11,881  -->  00:10:15,792
while still maintaining its aspect ratio, okay?
237

237

00:10:15,792  -->  00:10:16,687
And the part of the video
238

238

00:10:16,687  -->  00:10:19,112
that then don't fit the parent element,
239

239

00:10:19,112  -->  00:10:21,714
they will simply be clipped off, okay?
240

240

00:10:21,714  -->  00:10:23,781
Let's take a look now.
241

241

00:10:23,781  -->  00:10:24,614
And here we go.
242

242

00:10:24,614  -->  00:10:26,103
So that's the solution.
243

243

00:10:26,103  -->  00:10:29,121
And that makes it work, actually.
244

244

00:10:29,121  -->  00:10:29,954
Alright.
245

245

00:10:29,954  -->  00:10:32,802
Well, still not 100%, but we're almost there.
246

246

00:10:32,802  -->  00:10:35,344
And again, what did the trick
247

247

00:10:35,344  -->  00:10:37,829
was this object-fit cover.
248

248

00:10:37,829  -->  00:10:38,943
So, again, this is very similar
249

249

00:10:38,943  -->  00:10:41,173
to having background size set to cover
250

250

00:10:41,173  -->  00:10:44,806
where it tries to cover the entire element with the image.
251

251

00:10:44,806  -->  00:10:46,873
And so object-fit is similar to that,
252

252

00:10:46,873  -->  00:10:49,183
but instead of working with background images,
253

253

00:10:49,183  -->  00:10:52,248
it works with HTML elements, or videos in this case.
254

254

00:10:52,248  -->  00:10:55,186
But of course it would work just the same with images.
255

255

00:10:55,186  -->  00:10:56,916
And so we can have one parent element,
256

256

00:10:56,916  -->  00:10:58,413
and in there, an image,
257

257

00:10:58,413  -->  00:10:59,830
and then with object-fit
258

258

00:10:59,830  -->  00:11:03,766
we can make that image cover the parent element.
259

259

00:11:03,766  -->  00:11:05,751
And we could actually use other values here
260

260

00:11:05,751  -->  00:11:07,351
instead of cover.
261

261

00:11:07,351  -->  00:11:09,803
So, let me show that to you, okay?
262

262

00:11:09,803  -->  00:11:12,136
So, right now we have cover,
263

263

00:11:13,052  -->  00:11:15,292
but we could also have,
264

264

00:11:15,292  -->  00:11:17,743
and let me reload this,
265

265

00:11:17,743  -->  00:11:20,076
but we could also have fill.
266

266

00:11:21,041  -->  00:11:22,432
And what it would do then
267

267

00:11:22,432  -->  00:11:25,047
is to make it fill in all the height and all the width
268

268

00:11:25,047  -->  00:11:28,006
but not maintaining its aspect ratio.
269

269

00:11:28,006  -->  00:11:30,352
So, you see now actually in the video here,
270

270

00:11:30,352  -->  00:11:31,699
that the aspect ratio is different.
271

271

00:11:31,699  -->  00:11:34,288
It's not the way it should be.
272

272

00:11:34,288  -->  00:11:35,171
Let me remove that
273

273

00:11:35,171  -->  00:11:37,491
and you will actually immediately see it, right?
274

274

00:11:37,491  -->  00:11:40,649
It doesn't look natural anymore, okay?
275

275

00:11:40,649  -->  00:11:42,566
So, it should be cover.
276

276

00:11:43,878  -->  00:11:45,863
Then it's good again, okay?
277

277

00:11:45,863  -->  00:11:48,940
And finally, it could also be contain,
278

278

00:11:48,940  -->  00:11:51,181
but I think that's also not really useful,
279

279

00:11:51,181  -->  00:11:53,096
because basically that's what we had before.
280

280

00:11:53,096  -->  00:11:55,604
It's trying to fill its parent element
281

281

00:11:55,604  -->  00:11:57,903
but without clipping anything on the sides.
282

282

00:11:57,903  -->  00:11:59,064
And that's not what we want.
283

283

00:11:59,064  -->  00:12:00,564
So, we want cover.
284

284

00:12:01,641  -->  00:12:05,682
Then it's filling the parent element from top to bottom,
285

285

00:12:05,682  -->  00:12:08,677
or I want from top to bottom here, of course.
286

286

00:12:08,677  -->  00:12:13,331
And then clipping on the side what is too much, okay?
287

287

00:12:13,331  -->  00:12:15,922
Now, it's actually not 100% clipping everything
288

288

00:12:15,922  -->  00:12:19,184
that it should, so it's going a bit outside here.
289

289

00:12:19,184  -->  00:12:21,599
And so we have to fix that.
290

290

00:12:21,599  -->  00:12:22,922
And so, such as we did before,
291

291

00:12:22,922  -->  00:12:26,475
when something overflows our element,
292

292

00:12:26,475  -->  00:12:28,392
we use overflow hidden.
293

293

00:12:29,366  -->  00:12:32,512
So, this is a very handy property, so keep that one in mind.
294

294

00:12:32,512  -->  00:12:34,080
Whenever something like this happens,
295

295

00:12:34,080  -->  00:12:36,216
you can just throw that in there
296

296

00:12:36,216  -->  00:12:40,407
and it will fix the problem just like this, okay?
297

297

00:12:40,407  -->  00:12:42,926
And so I think that is actually it.
298

298

00:12:42,926  -->  00:12:46,549
So, you just implemented a background video in CSS.
299

299

00:12:46,549  -->  00:12:48,789
So, that's really cool, right?
300

300

00:12:48,789  -->  00:12:51,111
Maybe you have seen this effect somewhere on some page,
301

301

00:12:51,111  -->  00:12:53,688
but never really knew how it works.
302

302

00:12:53,688  -->  00:12:55,221
And it's actually a bit more simple
303

303

00:12:55,221  -->  00:12:57,009
maybe than you think, right?
304

304

00:12:57,009  -->  00:12:59,262
So, it was just a handful of different properties
305

305

00:12:59,262  -->  00:13:02,138
and then pulling the video into the HTML,
306

306

00:13:02,138  -->  00:13:03,313
and that's it.
307

307

00:13:03,313  -->  00:13:05,785
So, another section completed.
308

308

00:13:05,785  -->  00:13:07,886
So, we're moving on greatly here.
309

309

00:13:07,886  -->  00:13:10,233
All that we have left to do is
310

310

00:13:10,233  -->  00:13:12,276
actually this booking section here,
311

311

00:13:12,276  -->  00:13:14,494
then this very simple footer.
312

312

00:13:14,494  -->  00:13:16,201
This navigation here, of course.
313

313

00:13:16,201  -->  00:13:17,571
So, that's something that I left for the end
314

314

00:13:17,571  -->  00:13:19,776
because it's rather complex.
315

315

00:13:19,776  -->  00:13:22,108
So, this great navigation here.
316

316

00:13:22,108  -->  00:13:24,885
And then another thing that's also missing
317

317

00:13:24,885  -->  00:13:26,185
that I showed you in the beginning
318

318

00:13:26,185  -->  00:13:28,101
is that when you hover over these cards
319

319

00:13:28,101  -->  00:13:29,562
and hit the button,
320

320

00:13:29,562  -->  00:13:32,141
then it actually shows this popup box here.
321

321

00:13:32,141  -->  00:13:35,020
So, this is all pure CSS once more.
322

322

00:13:35,020  -->  00:13:37,017
And so, you're going to learn that
323

323

00:13:37,017  -->  00:13:38,979
over the next couple of lectures, okay?
324

324

00:13:38,979  -->  00:13:42,439
But we're making good progress, so keep hanging in there.
325

325

00:13:42,439  -->  00:13:44,689
And I'll see you next time.
