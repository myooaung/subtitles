1

00:00:01,474  -->  00:00:02,715
<v Instructor>This is the second part</v>
2

2

00:00:02,715  -->  00:00:04,852
of building the story section.
3

3

00:00:04,852  -->  00:00:06,352
So let's continue.
4

4

00:00:07,286  -->  00:00:09,253
And again this is how it looks like.
5

5

00:00:09,253  -->  00:00:11,647
So we have like this background image here
6

6

00:00:11,647  -->  00:00:13,972
in the back of course.
7

7

00:00:13,972  -->  00:00:15,687
And then we have these two images here.
8

8

00:00:15,687  -->  00:00:17,297
This one here kind of in the center
9

9

00:00:17,297  -->  00:00:19,869
with this couple here that supposedly just
10

10

00:00:19,869  -->  00:00:22,776
built a new house for themselves which is this one.
11

11

00:00:22,776  -->  00:00:24,198
And so this one is on top
12

12

00:00:24,198  -->  00:00:26,324
and it actually also overlaps a bit
13

13

00:00:26,324  -->  00:00:27,948
this part of the section
14

14

00:00:27,948  -->  00:00:30,146
and goes all the way in this here.
15

15

00:00:30,146  -->  00:00:32,242
And I think this creates kind of a modern
16

16

00:00:32,242  -->  00:00:34,129
and catchy look.
17

17

00:00:34,129  -->  00:00:34,962
Okay.
18

18

00:00:34,962  -->  00:00:36,855
So that's why I went for that.
19

19

00:00:36,855  -->  00:00:38,838
So how are we gonna do this?
20

20

00:00:38,838  -->  00:00:41,785
Well, we're just gonna create a (mumbles) grid,
21

21

00:00:41,785  -->  00:00:44,156
basically occupying this entire area here
22

22

00:00:44,156  -->  00:00:47,326
and then we're gonna just position these two images
23

23

00:00:47,326  -->  00:00:48,159
on there.
24

24

00:00:48,159  -->  00:00:50,422
We could do this in many many different ways.
25

25

00:00:50,422  -->  00:00:52,631
I choose to just do it like this,
26

26

00:00:52,631  -->  00:00:53,491
because again,
27

27

00:00:53,491  -->  00:00:55,284
this is a grid course
28

28

00:00:55,284  -->  00:00:57,487
and so that's what I'm gonna do here,
29

29

00:00:57,487  -->  00:00:58,820
using css grids.
30

30

00:01:01,090  -->  00:01:02,629
So first to mark up,
31

31

00:01:02,629  -->  00:01:04,721
which is just very simple,
32

32

00:01:04,721  -->  00:01:07,804
so img and the class is simply story,
33

33

00:01:10,715  -->  00:01:13,954
img and this one is number one
34

34

00:01:13,954  -->  00:01:16,478
and the source is image
35

35

00:01:16,478  -->  00:01:17,958
and story-1,
36

36

00:01:17,958  -->  00:01:19,674
and the alternative text
37

37

00:01:19,674  -->  00:01:20,507
is just
38

38

00:01:21,894  -->  00:01:26,424
Couple with new house let's say,
39

39

00:01:26,424  -->  00:01:29,007
and then let me just copy this,
40

40

00:01:29,918  -->  00:01:31,525
story-2
41

41

00:01:31,525  -->  00:01:32,358
and
42

42

00:01:33,296  -->  00:01:34,129
yeah.
43

43

00:01:34,129  -->  00:01:35,548
Let's just say that this is a new house
44

44

00:01:35,548  -->  00:01:38,798
and change this one to number two as well.
45

45

00:01:38,798  -->  00:01:39,631
Okay.
46

46

00:01:39,631  -->  00:01:40,464
And that is it.
47

47

00:01:40,464  -->  00:01:42,752
So let's now go ahead
48

48

00:01:42,752  -->  00:01:44,252
to our story file.
49

49

00:01:45,268  -->  00:01:47,581
So this one is the pictures part.
50

50

00:01:47,581  -->  00:01:51,343
So the container of this images is the pictures.
51

51

00:01:51,343  -->  00:01:55,551
So let's now turn this into a grid container.
52

52

00:01:55,551  -->  00:01:56,866
So,
53

53

00:01:56,866  -->  00:01:57,866
display grid
54

54

00:01:58,790  -->  00:02:02,540
and let's also set the styles for the images.
55

55

00:02:03,837  -->  00:02:05,587
So it's called img--1
56

56

00:02:10,658  -->  00:02:12,238
and img--2.
57

57

00:02:12,238  -->  00:02:13,644
So let's set both of them
58

58

00:02:13,644  -->  00:02:15,894
for now to width 100%.
59

59

00:02:17,824  -->  00:02:18,657
Okay.
60

60

00:02:18,657  -->  00:02:20,911
So that is kind of what we always do.
61

61

00:02:20,911  -->  00:02:24,058
We always should specify a width and percentages
62

62

00:02:24,058  -->  00:02:27,067
for images so that they save flexible.
63

63

00:02:27,067  -->  00:02:29,327
Right we're then going to change this here
64

64

00:02:29,327  -->  00:02:30,394
maybe a bit later,
65

65

00:02:30,394  -->  00:02:31,630
but for now that's good.
66

66

00:02:31,630  -->  00:02:34,047
So let's take a look at that.
67

67

00:02:35,000  -->  00:02:36,324
And so right now of course,
68

68

00:02:36,324  -->  00:02:38,518
they occupied the entire container.
69

69

00:02:38,518  -->  00:02:41,032
So the container is this one here.
70

70

00:02:41,032  -->  00:02:44,136
And so they occupy 100% of that.
71

71

00:02:44,136  -->  00:02:45,650
But that is of course not the result
72

72

00:02:45,650  -->  00:02:47,417
that we want to see in the end.
73

73

00:02:47,417  -->  00:02:49,900
So again let's create a grid here
74

74

00:02:49,900  -->  00:02:52,877
and then position these items in there.
75

75

00:02:52,877  -->  00:02:54,012
So and what I want to do
76

76

00:02:54,012  -->  00:02:56,432
is to create a six by six grid,
77

77

00:02:56,432  -->  00:02:57,615
and let me show you why
78

78

00:02:57,615  -->  00:02:59,224
here in the final example.
79

79

00:02:59,224  -->  00:03:00,790
So with six by six,
80

80

00:03:00,790  -->  00:03:03,441
basically this space here is one column,
81

81

00:03:03,441  -->  00:03:05,254
this space here is another column
82

82

00:03:05,254  -->  00:03:08,722
and then this one here is the other four columns.
83

83

00:03:08,722  -->  00:03:09,780
And so with this,
84

84

00:03:09,780  -->  00:03:14,142
basically we have 4/6 of the container as image
85

85

00:03:14,142  -->  00:03:16,864
and the other 2/6 so 1/3
86

86

00:03:16,864  -->  00:03:19,039
as the remaining space.
87

87

00:03:19,039  -->  00:03:19,872
Right.
88

88

00:03:19,872  -->  00:03:23,231
So basically 66% of this container will be the image
89

89

00:03:23,231  -->  00:03:26,080
and then 33% will be the remaining space.
90

90

00:03:26,080  -->  00:03:28,234
So 16.7% here on each side.
91

91

00:03:28,234  -->  00:03:30,154
On this side and on this side.
92

92

00:03:30,154  -->  00:03:30,987
Okay.
93

93

00:03:30,987  -->  00:03:32,925
We could've done it completely different way
94

94

00:03:32,925  -->  00:03:34,378
but I want it to be like this.
95

95

00:03:34,378  -->  00:03:38,029
I want a 2/3 of the width of this to be the image.
96

96

00:03:38,029  -->  00:03:38,862
Okay.
97

97

00:03:38,862  -->  00:03:40,522
And so a six by six container,
98

98

00:03:40,522  -->  00:03:41,758
it goes the same thing then
99

99

00:03:41,758  -->  00:03:44,284
can applied to the rows as well.
100

100

00:03:44,284  -->  00:03:45,117
Okay.
101

101

00:03:45,117  -->  00:03:46,370
So.
102

102

00:03:46,370  -->  00:03:47,370
Very simple.
103

103

00:03:48,847  -->  00:03:50,430
Grid-template-rows.
104

104

00:03:52,528  -->  00:03:56,757
Repeat(6,1fr).
105

105

00:03:56,757  -->  00:04:00,924
So again we use 1fr to create equally sized tracks.
106

106

00:04:02,090  -->  00:04:05,980
So rows in this case and columns in this case.
107

107

00:04:05,980  -->  00:04:07,249
Okay so,
108

108

00:04:07,249  -->  00:04:08,730
let's take a look at that,
109

109

00:04:08,730  -->  00:04:10,335
just to that we know where we want
110

110

00:04:10,335  -->  00:04:11,796
to actually position them.
111

111

00:04:11,796  -->  00:04:14,259
Oh and just see that now already these images
112

112

00:04:14,259  -->  00:04:16,295
are occupying one grid cell
113

113

00:04:16,295  -->  00:04:19,867
and no longer the entire parent container.
114

114

00:04:19,867  -->  00:04:21,284
So where is that,
115

115

00:04:22,512  -->  00:04:23,845
it's this one here.
116

116

00:04:23,845  -->  00:04:27,171
You see it's a six by six grid.
117

117

00:04:27,171  -->  00:04:31,086
And each of these images is now in one of the grid cells
118

118

00:04:31,086  -->  00:04:34,059
occupying 100% of the width.
119

119

00:04:34,059  -->  00:04:35,313
Okay so.
120

120

00:04:35,313  -->  00:04:38,317
Now what do we want to do with this image here.
121

121

00:04:38,317  -->  00:04:41,705
We want it to start here at the line number two
122

122

00:04:41,705  -->  00:04:44,479
and going all the way to line number six.
123

123

00:04:44,479  -->  00:04:45,312
And for the rows,
124

124

00:04:45,312  -->  00:04:46,145
we want the same.
125

125

00:04:46,145  -->  00:04:49,262
So going from number two to number six.
126

126

00:04:49,262  -->  00:04:50,122
Okay.
127

127

00:04:50,122  -->  00:04:51,539
So let's do that.
128

128

00:04:54,362  -->  00:04:57,902
So grid-row:2/6
129

129

00:04:57,902  -->  00:05:00,552
or we could use ban four but,
130

130

00:05:00,552  -->  00:05:02,275
let's just do it like this.
131

131

00:05:02,275  -->  00:05:06,008
And then grid-column the same two and six.
132

132

00:05:06,008  -->  00:05:08,811
So let's now take a look at result.
133

133

00:05:08,811  -->  00:05:10,514
And it looks like this.
134

134

00:05:10,514  -->  00:05:11,641
And now what you see here
135

135

00:05:11,641  -->  00:05:14,339
is kind of a weird behavior right?
136

136

00:05:14,339  -->  00:05:17,256
And that's because this grid item here
137

137

00:05:17,256  -->  00:05:19,816
doesn't really fit the grid area.
138

138

00:05:19,816  -->  00:05:20,649
Okay.
139

139

00:05:20,649  -->  00:05:22,449
And that is because it is an image.
140

140

00:05:22,449  -->  00:05:24,634
So regular grid items,
141

141

00:05:24,634  -->  00:05:26,496
like if this was just a div,
142

142

00:05:26,496  -->  00:05:30,203
it would fill up it's entire grid area, right?
143

143

00:05:30,203  -->  00:05:31,616
So this entire area here
144

144

00:05:31,616  -->  00:05:33,143
that we defined.
145

145

00:05:33,143  -->  00:05:34,177
But not images.
146

146

00:05:34,177  -->  00:05:36,507
And that's because images are different.
147

147

00:05:36,507  -->  00:05:39,992
In a sense that they have an intrinsic aspect ratio
148

148

00:05:39,992  -->  00:05:41,543
associate of with them.
149

149

00:05:41,543  -->  00:05:44,318
So meaning that it has some dimensions
150

150

00:05:44,318  -->  00:05:47,246
and therefore also an aspect ratio.
151

151

00:05:47,246  -->  00:05:50,215
And what happens is that the image always tries to keep
152

152

00:05:50,215  -->  00:05:51,711
that aspect ratio,
153

153

00:05:51,711  -->  00:05:54,015
even if we tell it that it should fill up
154

154

00:05:54,015  -->  00:05:56,265
this entire grid area here.
155

155

00:05:57,393  -->  00:05:58,627
So doesn't really do that,
156

156

00:05:58,627  -->  00:06:01,618
instead it keeps its aspect ratio.
157

157

00:06:01,618  -->  00:06:04,633
Now if you want this to be truly here in the center,
158

158

00:06:04,633  -->  00:06:08,074
then we can simply set the align items property
159

159

00:06:08,074  -->  00:06:09,502
to center right.
160

160

00:06:09,502  -->  00:06:10,470
That's because,
161

161

00:06:10,470  -->  00:06:13,893
remember the align items property aligns grid items
162

162

00:06:13,893  -->  00:06:18,131
to their grid cells in the column access.
163

163

00:06:18,131  -->  00:06:19,674
So if we do that,
164

164

00:06:19,674  -->  00:06:22,296
here on the container of course,
165

165

00:06:22,296  -->  00:06:26,379
align items set to center
166

166

00:06:27,711  -->  00:06:30,902
and then it is centered in its grid area.
167

167

00:06:30,902  -->  00:06:31,985
Okay.
168

168

00:06:31,985  -->  00:06:33,077
So once more,
169

169

00:06:33,077  -->  00:06:35,807
these properties like align and justify,
170

170

00:06:35,807  -->  00:06:37,639
they're really useful and helpful
171

171

00:06:37,639  -->  00:06:40,164
to know them in situations like this.
172

172

00:06:40,164  -->  00:06:43,355
And you see that also it already happened up here
173

173

00:06:43,355  -->  00:06:46,669
so this small image here is now also
174

174

00:06:46,669  -->  00:06:50,730
centered vertically inside of its grid cell.
175

175

00:06:50,730  -->  00:06:53,274
So next up is then this image here.
176

176

00:06:53,274  -->  00:06:55,034
We want it to be like
177

177

00:06:55,034  -->  00:06:57,322
kind of here in the center of this.
178

178

00:06:57,322  -->  00:07:00,233
So starting like here from this middle point of the grid
179

179

00:07:00,233  -->  00:07:03,000
and then expanding all the way to this side.
180

180

00:07:03,000  -->  00:07:06,137
So we're gonna go from column number four.
181

181

00:07:06,137  -->  00:07:07,878
So number four to seven,
182

182

00:07:07,878  -->  00:07:09,238
and then from the row,
183

183

00:07:09,238  -->  00:07:13,259
we go from line number four to line number six.
184

184

00:07:13,259  -->  00:07:14,121
Alright.
185

185

00:07:14,121  -->  00:07:15,788
So image number two,
186

186

00:07:17,467  -->  00:07:18,393
grid-row
187

187

00:07:18,393  -->  00:07:19,643
we go from four
188

188

00:07:21,381  -->  00:07:22,214
to six,
189

189

00:07:25,587  -->  00:07:27,376
and then for the column,
190

190

00:07:27,376  -->  00:07:29,263
from four to seven,
191

191

00:07:29,263  -->  00:07:30,096
I believe.
192

192

00:07:32,010  -->  00:07:33,705
And so let's check that one out.
193

193

00:07:33,705  -->  00:07:35,576
And yeah, that's right.
194

194

00:07:35,576  -->  00:07:36,409
Okay.
195

195

00:07:36,409  -->  00:07:37,390
Now,
196

196

00:07:37,390  -->  00:07:38,479
here in this situation,
197

197

00:07:38,479  -->  00:07:41,398
this actually overlaps it a little bit.
198

198

00:07:41,398  -->  00:07:42,231
Right.
199

199

00:07:42,231  -->  00:07:43,753
And how do we achieve that?
200

200

00:07:43,753  -->  00:07:45,386
We'll it's actually quite simple
201

201

00:07:45,386  -->  00:07:47,494
and we could do it in two ways.
202

202

00:07:47,494  -->  00:07:51,118
We could use a transform and simply scale it up a little bit
203

203

00:07:51,118  -->  00:07:53,312
but then it wouldn't really start here
204

204

00:07:53,312  -->  00:07:54,591
in the middle here anymore.
205

205

00:07:54,591  -->  00:07:57,637
Unless we then also define the transform origin
206

206

00:07:57,637  -->  00:07:59,621
but that's a bit too much I believe.
207

207

00:07:59,621  -->  00:08:03,334
And so let's simply change their width of the image.
208

208

00:08:03,334  -->  00:08:06,931
So if we change this width to 115,
209

209

00:08:06,931  -->  00:08:08,957
or something a bit bigger or smaller,
210

210

00:08:08,957  -->  00:08:11,284
but a font that this one works really well
211

211

00:08:11,284  -->  00:08:12,753
if we change it to this,
212

212

00:08:12,753  -->  00:08:15,871
well then it's just going to
213

213

00:08:15,871  -->  00:08:17,535
increase to the side.
214

214

00:08:17,535  -->  00:08:20,013
And now we cannot really see it,
215

215

00:08:20,013  -->  00:08:21,971
but if I inspected,
216

216

00:08:21,971  -->  00:08:25,516
then you will see that it actually moved to that side.
217

217

00:08:25,516  -->  00:08:26,349
Okay.
218

218

00:08:26,349  -->  00:08:28,553
And so why can we now not see it?
219

219

00:08:28,553  -->  00:08:30,856
Well it's just because of the z-index.
220

220

00:08:30,856  -->  00:08:34,273
So we have to assign it a bigger z-index.
221

221

00:08:35,465  -->  00:08:36,567
Any number really works here,
222

222

00:08:36,567  -->  00:08:38,290
let's just use something big,
223

223

00:08:38,290  -->  00:08:42,069
so something like 20 and then we should be good to go.
224

224

00:08:42,069  -->  00:08:44,782
And indeed now it is on top
225

225

00:08:44,782  -->  00:08:47,187
of this other element here on the side.
226

226

00:08:47,187  -->  00:08:49,616
All right so looking good already.
227

227

00:08:49,616  -->  00:08:52,207
Now let's just add a couple of shadows here
228

228

00:08:52,207  -->  00:08:53,557
to these images.
229

229

00:08:53,557  -->  00:08:54,390
So,
230

230

00:08:56,319  -->  00:08:57,638
box-shadow
231

231

00:08:57,638  -->  00:08:58,471
zero 2rem
232

232

00:08:59,480  -->  00:09:00,980
then 5rem of blur.
233

233

00:09:02,047  -->  00:09:04,214
And then an rgba of black,
234

234

00:09:05,576  -->  00:09:07,504
with just .1.
235

235

00:09:07,504  -->  00:09:11,613
And then the same here for the image number two.
236

236

00:09:11,613  -->  00:09:13,619
And this one with .2.
237

237

00:09:13,619  -->  00:09:16,456
Okay because this one here is actually overlapping
238

238

00:09:16,456  -->  00:09:18,223
this lighter area.
239

239

00:09:18,223  -->  00:09:21,398
And so otherwise people not see it at all.
240

240

00:09:21,398  -->  00:09:22,231
Okay.
241

241

00:09:22,231  -->  00:09:26,019
And now all we have to do is just this background area here,
242

242

00:09:26,019  -->  00:09:27,429
which I want to do at the beginning,
243

243

00:09:27,429  -->  00:09:28,846
but I just forgot about it.
244

244

00:09:28,846  -->  00:09:31,291
So let's do that now.
245

245

00:09:31,291  -->  00:09:35,458
So it is here in this pictures container of course.
246

246

00:09:36,303  -->  00:09:38,573
So let's just background-image
247

247

00:09:38,573  -->  00:09:39,406
url
248

248

00:09:40,264  -->  00:09:42,427
and then we have to move up one level,
249

249

00:09:42,427  -->  00:09:44,512
right because once this is compiled,
250

250

00:09:44,512  -->  00:09:47,002
we are in the css folder
251

251

00:09:47,002  -->  00:09:49,016
and from there we need to move up
252

252

00:09:49,016  -->  00:09:51,112
in the global project folder
253

253

00:09:51,112  -->  00:09:53,794
and then from there we go into img.
254

254

00:09:53,794  -->  00:09:54,627
Img,
255

255

00:09:55,510  -->  00:09:59,677
and then this one is called simply back.jpg.
256

256

00:10:01,502  -->  00:10:03,028
Now this is actually not all,
257

257

00:10:03,028  -->  00:10:06,204
because this is just the image like this,
258

258

00:10:06,204  -->  00:10:08,372
but we have this overlay here.
259

259

00:10:08,372  -->  00:10:11,180
In order to make it fit better into the overlook
260

260

00:10:11,180  -->  00:10:13,400
and color scheme of our page right.
261

261

00:10:13,400  -->  00:10:16,224
So like this it looks a bit out of place.
262

262

00:10:16,224  -->  00:10:17,315
You know.
263

263

00:10:17,315  -->  00:10:19,720
And so we need some overlay.
264

264

00:10:19,720  -->  00:10:20,743
With some color in order to make it
265

265

00:10:20,743  -->  00:10:22,826
look a bit more in place.
266

266

00:10:23,681  -->  00:10:27,345
So for that we just use the linear-gradient trick.
267

267

00:10:27,345  -->  00:10:29,428
Where we then use a color
268

268

00:10:30,450  -->  00:10:33,283
and in this case our primary color
269

269

00:10:35,022  -->  00:10:39,207
and give it some value here to make it 50% transparent.
270

270

00:10:39,207  -->  00:10:40,134
Okay.
271

271

00:10:40,134  -->  00:10:42,137
So this trick here with linear-gradient
272

272

00:10:42,137  -->  00:10:45,033
is to give it to equal colors,
273

273

00:10:45,033  -->  00:10:47,478
so basically the gradient goes from one color
274

274

00:10:47,478  -->  00:10:48,983
to the other color.
275

275

00:10:48,983  -->  00:10:51,677
So that is one background image on top
276

276

00:10:51,677  -->  00:10:53,094
and then after that,
277

277

00:10:53,094  -->  00:10:56,437
below it basically we have then the image.
278

278

00:10:56,437  -->  00:10:57,270
Okay.
279

279

00:10:57,270  -->  00:10:59,973
And so that should work now.
280

280

00:10:59,973  -->  00:11:01,857
And indeed here it is.
281

281

00:11:01,857  -->  00:11:04,616
So I hope that it made sense here with the positioning
282

282

00:11:04,616  -->  00:11:06,962
of the elements into this grid.
283

283

00:11:06,962  -->  00:11:09,945
Of course I could've had use absolute positioning
284

284

00:11:09,945  -->  00:11:11,208
to position these images,
285

285

00:11:11,208  -->  00:11:13,020
but I just want to do it like this,
286

286

00:11:13,020  -->  00:11:16,974
to use a grid once more for this purpose.
287

287

00:11:16,974  -->  00:11:19,911
And I think we created a quite a nice look here.
288

288

00:11:19,911  -->  00:11:20,744
All right.
289

289

00:11:20,744  -->  00:11:22,574
And so we already finished here with this
290

290

00:11:22,574  -->  00:11:24,218
and next up
291

291

00:11:24,218  -->  00:11:27,955
we're gonna tackle this next homes section here.
292

292

00:11:27,955  -->  00:11:28,788
Okay.
293

293

00:11:28,788  -->  00:11:31,854
So create these beautifully designed cards.
294

294

00:11:31,854  -->  00:11:33,687
So let's move on now.
