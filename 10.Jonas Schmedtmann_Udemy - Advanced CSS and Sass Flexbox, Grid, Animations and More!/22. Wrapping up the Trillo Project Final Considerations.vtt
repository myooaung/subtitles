00:00:01.554  -->  00:00:03.006
<v Instructor>So in this last video about</v>
2

2

00:00:03.006  -->  00:00:05.208
the Trillo Project, I just wanted to make
3

3

00:00:05.208  -->  00:00:07.430
some final remarks about the project
4

4

00:00:07.430  -->  00:00:10.418
itself and flexbox, in general.
5

5

00:00:10.418  -->  00:00:13.644
So here I have that web app I showed you before,
6

6

00:00:13.644  -->  00:00:15.227
called CanIUse.com.
7

7

00:00:16.700  -->  00:00:18.865
And so in here, we can see the browser support
8

8

00:00:18.865  -->  00:00:22.824
for various CSS properties and entire modules as well,
9

9

00:00:22.824  -->  00:00:24.284
so like the flexbox module,
10

10

00:00:24.284  -->  00:00:25.708
and so that's what I have here.
11

11

00:00:25.708  -->  00:00:27.631
So I just typed flexbox here and
12

12

00:00:27.631  -->  00:00:32.194
then down here we can see the browser support for flexbox.
13

13

00:00:32.194  -->  00:00:35.326
So here I can hit Show All and so now we can see
14

14

00:00:35.326  -->  00:00:40.142
which browsers do support and which don't support flexbox.
15

15

00:00:40.142  -->  00:00:42.780
So you see that with Internet Explorer 11,
16

16

00:00:42.780  -->  00:00:44.441
there are some problems with that,
17

17

00:00:44.441  -->  00:00:46.324
and with the 10 as well.
18

18

00:00:46.324  -->  00:00:49.863
But you also see that their usage is not really that big,
19

19

00:00:49.863  -->  00:00:52.030
like .11% or 3%.
20

20

00:00:53.307  -->  00:00:57.320
Then you see that all the Microsoft Edges support it,
21

21

00:00:57.320  -->  00:01:01.589
Firefox as well, Chrome, Safari, Opera as well,
22

22

00:01:01.589  -->  00:01:05.117
and even here mobile Safari on IOS.
23

23

00:01:05.117  -->  00:01:07.218
So the only problem that you may have is here with
24

24

00:01:07.218  -->  00:01:10.550
the older Android browsers but it also supports flexbox
25

25

00:01:10.550  -->  00:01:12.829
here with the web kit prefix.
26

26

00:01:12.829  -->  00:01:16.947
Then you also have this Android stock browser here,
27

27

00:01:16.947  -->  00:01:19.512
which just supports the old flexbox pack
28

28

00:01:19.512  -->  00:01:21.752
and does not support rapping.
29

29

00:01:21.752  -->  00:01:24.298
So overall, you see the browser support is not
30

30

00:01:24.298  -->  00:01:27.953
all of that bad so actually up here,
31

31

00:01:27.953  -->  00:01:29.898
you can see the global stats.
32

32

00:01:29.898  -->  00:01:33.039
And you see that actually 88, almost 89%,
33

33

00:01:33.039  -->  00:01:36.644
of the web users, do actually support the unprefixed
34

34

00:01:36.644  -->  00:01:39.895
version of flexbox, which is the one we're looking for.
35

35

00:01:39.895  -->  00:01:41.895
So its not all that bad.
36

36

00:01:42.762  -->  00:01:44.338
Now remember that a long time ago,
37

37

00:01:44.338  -->  00:01:47.017
I think it was in the first project or so,
38

38

00:01:47.017  -->  00:01:50.586
that I said that flexbox is not really ready to be reused,
39

39

00:01:50.586  -->  00:01:53.698
so I said that because I assumed that the goal was
40

40

00:01:53.698  -->  00:01:56.721
to support everyone, so every user on every browser.
41

41

00:01:56.721  -->  00:01:58.907
But if you're okay with, for example,
42

42

00:01:58.907  -->  00:02:03.322
dropping these older versions of Internet Explorer,
43

43

00:02:03.322  -->  00:02:05.894
then that's absolutely fine, and you can go ahead and use
44

44

00:02:05.894  -->  00:02:09.301
flexbox today for all your sites, all your apps,
45

45

00:02:09.301  -->  00:02:11.899
and never again have to use a flow of layouts.
46

46

00:02:11.899  -->  00:02:15.042
And if that's okay with you, then it's perfectly fine.
47

47

00:02:15.042  -->  00:02:17.307
Just remember that layout is a fundamental part
48

48

00:02:17.307  -->  00:02:20.692
of any website or any web app, and so if a browser
49

49

00:02:20.692  -->  00:02:23.116
doesn't support it, well, it's gonna look really messy
50

50

00:02:23.116  -->  00:02:24.855
to that user.
51

51

00:02:24.855  -->  00:02:27.338
And actually I wanted to know, how the trillo app
52

52

00:02:27.338  -->  00:02:29.566
would look like without flexbox and so,
53

53

00:02:29.566  -->  00:02:33.213
I simply disabled all the flexbox in our app,
54

54

00:02:33.213  -->  00:02:35.951
and that's what it looked like, okay.
55

55

00:02:35.951  -->  00:02:38.397
So it looks really terrible as you can see,
56

56

00:02:38.397  -->  00:02:41.549
so moving down here, this is how our website looks,
57

57

00:02:41.549  -->  00:02:45.466
or our app, without any flexbox support at all.
58

58

00:02:47.616  -->  00:02:51.059
Now it's still kind of usable, but of course,
59

59

00:02:51.059  -->  00:02:53.476
it looks just terrible, okay.
60

60

00:02:54.584  -->  00:02:59.088
Now for users on Internet Explorer like 10, or 9, or 8 even,
61

61

00:02:59.088  -->  00:03:00.683
many of the features we're using here
62

62

00:03:00.683  -->  00:03:02.516
are not going to work anyway,
63

63

00:03:02.516  -->  00:03:04.953
so you kind of have to decide anyway if you want to support
64

64

00:03:04.953  -->  00:03:08.840
these users or not when you use other properties,
65

65

00:03:08.840  -->  00:03:11.031
that I showed you along this project,
66

66

00:03:11.031  -->  00:03:12.778
and the other project as well.
67

67

00:03:12.778  -->  00:03:15.641
So again, using flexbox or not,
68

68

00:03:15.641  -->  00:03:17.538
is a decision you have to take,
69

69

00:03:17.538  -->  00:03:20.429
keeping in mind that maybe some users will not
70

70

00:03:20.429  -->  00:03:23.319
really be able to see our page, but that might be
71

71

00:03:23.319  -->  00:03:25.066
actually completely fine.
72

72

00:03:25.066  -->  00:03:26.953
For example, the Internet Explorer users,
73

73

00:03:26.953  -->  00:03:29.832
they are many times older people or maybe people working
74

74

00:03:29.832  -->  00:03:32.818
in older companies that don't update their
75

75

00:03:32.818  -->  00:03:34.855
computers or their operating systems,
76

76

00:03:34.855  -->  00:03:37.648
and therefore they're stuck with Internet Explorer.
77

77

00:03:37.648  -->  00:03:40.420
But if that's not the audience of your website anyway,
78

78

00:03:40.420  -->  00:03:42.508
well, then you can just assume that you don't need to
79

79

00:03:42.508  -->  00:03:44.368
support them, and then it's no problem to
80

80

00:03:44.368  -->  00:03:47.318
simply start using flexbox right now.
81

81

00:03:47.318  -->  00:03:51.068
So that's what I wanted to say about support.
82

82

00:03:52.680  -->  00:03:54.371
And since we're talking about support,
83

83

00:03:54.371  -->  00:03:58.538
let's actually open up our app here in an older Safari,
84

84

00:04:01.255  -->  00:04:03.200
actually I mean in an older Firefox
85

85

00:04:03.200  -->  00:04:05.283
that I showed you before.
86

86

00:04:11.100  -->  00:04:14.511
Because then here you will see that the mask image
87

87

00:04:14.511  -->  00:04:17.099
property that we used here is not working,
88

88

00:04:17.099  -->  00:04:19.906
right, so you cannot see these icons here because
89

89

00:04:19.906  -->  00:04:22.730
the mask image and mask side properties that we used
90

90

00:04:22.730  -->  00:04:24.818
are simply not working.
91

91

00:04:24.818  -->  00:04:27.186
So back then when we implemented this,
92

92

00:04:27.186  -->  00:04:29.961
I said that I was gonna write a feature query for that
93

93

00:04:29.961  -->  00:04:33.996
a bit later and right now, that's the time to do it.
94

94

00:04:33.996  -->  00:04:36.451
So let's move back to our code editor,
95

95

00:04:36.451  -->  00:04:40.701
and here to our list, and so we are going to write a
96

96

00:04:40.701  -->  00:04:45.204
feature query containing this part here of the code.
97

97

00:04:45.204  -->  00:04:46.954
So how do we do that?
98

98

00:04:49.386  -->  00:04:52.410
Well, its just support, and then we have to put
99

99

00:04:52.410  -->  00:04:54.758
the property that we want supported.
100

100

00:04:54.758  -->  00:04:58.675
So we want web kit mask image, to be supported.
101

101

00:05:01.132  -->  00:05:04.626
And remember we also have to specify a value here,
102

102

00:05:04.626  -->  00:05:06.539
and so I'm just gonna put an empty image here,
103

103

00:05:06.539  -->  00:05:07.981
it doesn't really matter.
104

104

00:05:07.981  -->  00:05:11.366
This is just because we really have to specify the value.
105

105

00:05:11.366  -->  00:05:15.312
Or, the same thing here but without the prefix.
106

106

00:05:15.312  -->  00:05:18.045
Okay, so if you put something with the prefix here,
107

107

00:05:18.045  -->  00:05:22.212
we should also include the diversion without the prefix.
108

108

00:05:25.664  -->  00:05:29.747
So, if we support the mask image, then of course,
109

109

00:05:31.304  -->  00:05:33.211
this is what should happen,
110

110

00:05:33.211  -->  00:05:36.560
but if we don't, well, then, this is what happens.
111

111

00:05:36.560  -->  00:05:38.925
So the background image set to the icon,
112

112

00:05:38.925  -->  00:05:41.193
and our background size cover.
113

113

00:05:41.193  -->  00:05:43.862
So that was actually the first solution that I showed you
114

114

00:05:43.862  -->  00:05:46.350
back then, but the problem with this is, remember,
115

115

00:05:46.350  -->  00:05:49.258
is that we cannot change the color of the icon.
116

116

00:05:49.258  -->  00:05:51.667
But that's something that we cannot really change,
117

117

00:05:51.667  -->  00:05:54.267
so the on this older Mozilla broswers, for example,
118

118

00:05:54.267  -->  00:05:57.020
the user will just see the icon in black,
119

119

00:05:57.020  -->  00:05:58.736
not in our pink color.
120

120

00:05:58.736  -->  00:06:00.518
Now this is not really going to work,
121

121

00:06:00.518  -->  00:06:02.493
but let me show you why, okay.
122

122

00:06:02.493  -->  00:06:06.006
So, actually here, it's not working here in Firefox
123

123

00:06:06.006  -->  00:06:09.625
but if you take a look at Chrome now,
124

124

00:06:09.625  -->  00:06:11.553
you see that it's also black.
125

125

00:06:11.553  -->  00:06:13.970
So let's take a look at that.
126

126

00:06:18.392  -->  00:06:21.902
So you see that, of course, the mask image,
127

127

00:06:21.902  -->  00:06:25.020
and the mask cover are applied because in fact,
128

128

00:06:25.020  -->  00:06:27.487
we do support the mask image.
129

129

00:06:27.487  -->  00:06:29.959
Now the problem here is that at the same time,
130

130

00:06:29.959  -->  00:06:32.748
the background image is also active,
131

131

00:06:32.748  -->  00:06:35.244
and so we have to basically remove that,
132

132

00:06:35.244  -->  00:06:37.204
because if we didn't have the background image,
133

133

00:06:37.204  -->  00:06:40.297
then it would look just fine.
134

134

00:06:40.297  -->  00:06:44.693
Okay, so what we have to do here now is to just say
135

135

00:06:44.693  -->  00:06:48.610
background-image, none, and that should fix it.
136

136

00:06:50.967  -->  00:06:52.089
So you see?
137

137

00:06:52.089  -->  00:06:55.542
Now we have our pink icon, here in Chrome,
138

138

00:06:55.542  -->  00:06:58.580
and if we go to Safari, we have it in black,
139

139

00:06:58.580  -->  00:07:02.837
because it doesn't support the mask-image.
140

140

00:07:02.837  -->  00:07:04.918
So that's the power of the feature query
141

141

00:07:04.918  -->  00:07:07.034
using the support attribute.
142

142

00:07:07.034  -->  00:07:10.335
Next up, I also wanted to run or build process here
143

143

00:07:10.335  -->  00:07:14.085
in this project, so, let's close this folder.
144

144

00:07:15.631  -->  00:07:18.616
So this is here, or package.json file,
145

145

00:07:18.616  -->  00:07:20.676
remember that right in the beginning,
146

146

00:07:20.676  -->  00:07:23.381
we actually edited and reduced the build process here
147

147

00:07:23.381  -->  00:07:28.047
to only three steps, so compiled, prefix, and compressed.
148

148

00:07:28.047  -->  00:07:31.822
So let's just take a look at our compiled CSS file,
149

149

00:07:31.822  -->  00:07:34.140
which we already have here, which is this one.
150

150

00:07:34.140  -->  00:07:35.719
And so we see that we actually wrote
151

151

00:07:35.719  -->  00:07:40.287
over 500 lines of CSS code, so that's a great job,
152

152

00:07:40.287  -->  00:07:42.603
a lot of code here.
153

153

00:07:42.603  -->  00:07:46.770
And now, let me just take a look at the file size here.
154

154

00:07:49.820  -->  00:07:53.843
So, just because I'm curious, this has 13K,
155

155

00:07:53.843  -->  00:07:56.592
so that's not really a lot but anyway,
156

156

00:07:56.592  -->  00:07:58.627
let us apply our build process
157

157

00:07:58.627  -->  00:08:00.732
and see how much we can reduce this.
158

158

00:08:00.732  -->  00:08:03.034
So, let's open up the terminal here,
159

159

00:08:03.034  -->  00:08:05.617
and actually it's already here,
160

160

00:08:06.759  -->  00:08:09.079
and I'm gonna increase the font size of it
161

161

00:08:09.079  -->  00:08:11.718
so you can see what's going on,
162

162

00:08:11.718  -->  00:08:13.561
and I will actually stop this process here
163

163

00:08:13.561  -->  00:08:15.435
so the one that we used for development
164

164

00:08:15.435  -->  00:08:17.713
which tracks changes on our files.
165

165

00:08:17.713  -->  00:08:19.733
So on the mask I just hit command C,
166

166

00:08:19.733  -->  00:08:21.826
and on Windows, you'll probably
167

167

00:08:21.826  -->  00:08:24.059
just have to close the window.
168

168

00:08:24.059  -->  00:08:27.142
Alright, so lets decrease this a bit,
169

169

00:08:29.190  -->  00:08:31.763
and for now I'm going to do it one by one,
170

170

00:08:31.763  -->  00:08:34.009
okay so that we have all the files,
171

171

00:08:34.009  -->  00:08:36.913
or actually, that's not really necessary because
172

172

00:08:36.913  -->  00:08:39.607
if we simply run the build process here,
173

173

00:08:39.607  -->  00:08:43.774
then it will actually also give us all of these three files.
174

174

00:08:46.799  -->  00:08:47.632
MPM, run,
175

175

00:08:50.092  -->  00:08:51.009
build, CSS.
176

176

00:08:55.929  -->  00:08:57.906
And here we go.
177

177

00:08:57.906  -->  00:08:59.648
So that's actually it.
178

178

00:08:59.648  -->  00:09:03.469
So, our initial file is our complied file,
179

179

00:09:03.469  -->  00:09:05.058
so this one here, right?
180

180

00:09:05.058  -->  00:09:08.410
And this one is actually exactly the sane as the one
181

181

00:09:08.410  -->  00:09:10.373
that we looked at before,
182

182

00:09:10.373  -->  00:09:12.517
then from there comes the prefixed file,
183

183

00:09:12.517  -->  00:09:15.085
and so let's see if it adds any prefix here.
184

184

00:09:15.085  -->  00:09:18.168
And yeah, it added to the box sizing,
185

185

00:09:19.521  -->  00:09:22.702
and so you see it also added a bunch of prefixes here
186

186

00:09:22.702  -->  00:09:25.981
for flexbox, so this is our original one,
187

187

00:09:25.981  -->  00:09:29.685
then we have MS flexbox which stands for
188

188

00:09:29.685  -->  00:09:32.309
the oldest specification on Microsoft.
189

189

00:09:32.309  -->  00:09:35.861
So MS flexbox is like the same as flex but
190

190

00:09:35.861  -->  00:09:38.787
in older versions of Internet Explorer,
191

191

00:09:38.787  -->  00:09:41.657
and then there's even something called web kit box,
192

192

00:09:41.657  -->  00:09:43.832
which was a very early implementation
193

193

00:09:43.832  -->  00:09:46.763
of the flexbox specification in web kit box.
194

194

00:09:46.763  -->  00:09:50.670
Then down here, you also have some older versions of
195

195

00:09:50.670  -->  00:09:54.060
the flexbox and that's practically the same
196

196

00:09:54.060  -->  00:09:57.488
as justify content space between, which used to be called
197

197

00:09:57.488  -->  00:10:02.067
MS flexpeck justify, and that's completely different but
198

198

00:10:02.067  -->  00:10:05.913
this is just to support the bit older Internet Explorers.
199

199

00:10:05.913  -->  00:10:09.270
So you'll find this here everywhere that we use flexbox,
200

200

00:10:09.270  -->  00:10:13.437
and so our file grew from I think we had 500 lines
201

201

00:10:15.412  -->  00:10:16.495
to 667 lines,
202

202

00:10:17.539  -->  00:10:19.785
and this down here is something called
203

203

00:10:19.785  -->  00:10:23.847
a source map, okay, doesn't really matter right now.
204

204

00:10:23.847  -->  00:10:28.090
So we have all of this CSS code right now,
205

205

00:10:28.090  -->  00:10:31.863
and that's then compressed in our final CSS file,
206

206

00:10:31.863  -->  00:10:33.946
so all of this code here,
207

207

00:10:35.400  -->  00:10:38.514
and then this way it doesn't even look like so much.
208

208

00:10:38.514  -->  00:10:39.907
Let's just take a look at how much
209

209

00:10:39.907  -->  00:10:42.421
space its occupying right now,
210

210

00:10:42.421  -->  00:10:45.254
so we had 13K and now we have 14K,
211

211

00:10:46.301  -->  00:10:48.762
and that's even more than we had before.
212

212

00:10:48.762  -->  00:10:50.826
I guess that's because of all of the prefixes,
213

213

00:10:50.826  -->  00:10:54.650
that we're at it, so of course that's not a huge deal.
214

214

00:10:54.650  -->  00:10:58.156
So 1K doesn't make any difference at all.
215

215

00:10:58.156  -->  00:11:00.773
So that was our build process,
216

216

00:11:00.773  -->  00:11:03.775
so just looking again at our site here,
217

217

00:11:03.775  -->  00:11:06.420
just one very quick thing that I want to say,
218

218

00:11:06.420  -->  00:11:09.209
is that this layout could also easily have been built
219

219

00:11:09.209  -->  00:11:13.421
with an even newer CSS module called CSS Grid Layout.
220

220

00:11:13.421  -->  00:11:17.201
So that Grid Layout would maybe even be better
221

221

00:11:17.201  -->  00:11:22.107
for laying out the global overall layout of this app here.
222

222

00:11:22.107  -->  00:11:25.556
So in modern CSS development, flexbox is many times used
223

223

00:11:25.556  -->  00:11:29.946
in conjunction with the newer CSS Grid Layout module,
224

224

00:11:29.946  -->  00:11:32.728
so that the older layout of the page or the app
225

225

00:11:32.728  -->  00:11:35.418
can be done with Grid and then the smaller details
226

226

00:11:35.418  -->  00:11:38.329
like most of the stuff we did here in the interface
227

227

00:11:38.329  -->  00:11:41.601
can be handled by using flexbox.
228

228

00:11:41.601  -->  00:11:43.393
But that's a topic for another project,
229

229

00:11:43.393  -->  00:11:45.981
and actually I will also have a Grid project
230

230

00:11:45.981  -->  00:11:48.437
right in this course, not at lunch time,
231

231

00:11:48.437  -->  00:11:50.759
but it's gonna be there a little bit later.
232

232

00:11:50.759  -->  00:11:52.703
So keep an eye out for that,
233

233

00:11:52.703  -->  00:11:54.545
and by then you will have learned everything
234

234

00:11:54.545  -->  00:11:57.298
there is to know about the very new, very modern,
235

235

00:11:57.298  -->  00:12:00.048
and really great CSS grid layout.
236

236

00:12:01.455  -->  00:12:03.225
So, we're now almost done,
237

237

00:12:03.225  -->  00:12:05.350
but another thing that I wanted to talk about is
238

238

00:12:05.350  -->  00:12:08.438
that there are actually many many ways to make this
239

239

00:12:08.438  -->  00:12:10.016
project even better.
240

240

00:12:10.016  -->  00:12:12.534
And these would be amazing ways for you to practice
241

241

00:12:12.534  -->  00:12:13.718
your new skills.
242

242

00:12:13.718  -->  00:12:16.507
So I came up with a couple of challenges
243

243

00:12:16.507  -->  00:12:18.907
for you to try out if you feel like it.
244

244

00:12:18.907  -->  00:12:21.265
So the first challenge that I came up with is,
245

245

00:12:21.265  -->  00:12:24.935
for you to display some kind of user menu when the user
246

246

00:12:24.935  -->  00:12:28.120
hovers over the username in the user-nav.
247

247

00:12:28.120  -->  00:12:30.463
Okay, so something like user settings
248

248

00:12:30.463  -->  00:12:32.498
or something like that.
249

249

00:12:32.498  -->  00:12:35.586
Then something very similar is to display a message menu
250

250

00:12:35.586  -->  00:12:39.086
when hovering over the chat icon in user-nav,
251

251

00:12:39.086  -->  00:12:41.075
so imagine something like Facebook,
252

252

00:12:41.075  -->  00:12:44.313
so when you hit the message icon, then it shows
253

253

00:12:44.313  -->  00:12:47.023
a list of your latest messages, right?
254

254

00:12:47.023  -->  00:12:49.566
So you could code up something like that.
255

255

00:12:49.566  -->  00:12:52.099
Another thing that would be really cool would be to
256

256

00:12:52.099  -->  00:12:55.562
display a box with suggestions as soon as the user
257

257

00:12:55.562  -->  00:12:58.439
starts typing in the input field,
258

258

00:12:58.439  -->  00:13:00.386
so up there in our search bar.
259

259

00:13:00.386  -->  00:13:02.242
So imagine when you Google something,
260

260

00:13:02.242  -->  00:13:05.159
and it also shows you this box with some suggestions,
261

261

00:13:05.159  -->  00:13:08.851
and you could code up something like that.
262

262

00:13:08.851  -->  00:13:11.835
Now next, you could also create a caption for the gallery
263

263

00:13:11.835  -->  00:13:14.172
item with a nice hover effect,
264

264

00:13:14.172  -->  00:13:16.829
so right now, we only have the figure element there,
265

265

00:13:16.829  -->  00:13:19.351
with an image but without any caption,
266

266

00:13:19.351  -->  00:13:21.353
and so you could add one caption and show that
267

267

00:13:21.353  -->  00:13:25.499
with a nice hover effect when we hover the image.
268

268

00:13:25.499  -->  00:13:29.143
And finally, you could make the page really 100% responsive
269

269

00:13:29.143  -->  00:13:32.357
even for viewport sizes below the 500px,
270

270

00:13:32.357  -->  00:13:34.397
because that's something we didn't really do
271

271

00:13:34.397  -->  00:13:36.689
because I didn't want to waste anymore of your time
272

272

00:13:36.689  -->  00:13:39.238
watching me type simple code, okay?
273

273

00:13:39.238  -->  00:13:41.890
And maybe you could even implement responsive images
274

274

00:13:41.890  -->  00:13:44.815
like we did in the Natures project.
275

275

00:13:44.815  -->  00:13:48.001
So these are five challenges for you to have some
276

276

00:13:48.001  -->  00:13:51.255
more fun with this project and with flexbox in general.
277

277

00:13:51.255  -->  00:13:53.418
Now I didn't actually code these up myself,
278

278

00:13:53.418  -->  00:13:56.262
and so of course I don't have a solution that I could
279

279

00:13:56.262  -->  00:13:58.702
show you but it would be really interesting to see
280

280

00:13:58.702  -->  00:14:02.219
how each and everyone of you implements these features
281

281

00:14:02.219  -->  00:14:03.604
in a different way.
282

282

00:14:03.604  -->  00:14:05.059
So if you do these challenges,
283

283

00:14:05.059  -->  00:14:08.050
then please please share your results in the questions area.
284

284

00:14:08.050  -->  00:14:10.742
I would really love to see your results, alright?
285

285

00:14:10.742  -->  00:14:11.919
Can you do that?
286

286

00:14:11.919  -->  00:14:16.038
Okay, and with this, we actually wrap up our Trillo Project.
287

287

00:14:16.038  -->  00:14:18.717
So I hope that you had as much fun building it
288

288

00:14:18.717  -->  00:14:21.863
as I did by building it with you together in these videos.
289

289

00:14:21.863  -->  00:14:24.322
And even more, I hope that you learned everything
290

290

00:14:24.322  -->  00:14:26.944
you want and need to know about flexbox so that now you
291

291

00:14:26.944  -->  00:14:30.362
can go ahead and code up your own design ideas and layouts,
292

292

00:14:30.362  -->  00:14:34.005
using the immense power and flexibility of flexbox.
293

293

00:14:34.005  -->  00:14:36.659
Alright, so that's it for this section.
294

294

00:14:36.659  -->  00:14:39.326
Hope to see you in the next one.
