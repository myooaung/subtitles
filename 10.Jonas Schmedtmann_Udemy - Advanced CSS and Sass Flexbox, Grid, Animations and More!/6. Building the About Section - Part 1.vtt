00:00:01.101  -->  00:00:03.125
<v Instructor>With our grid now in place,</v>
2

2

00:00:03.125  -->  00:00:05.374
we can actually start using it now
3

3

00:00:05.374  -->  00:00:07.625
by building the About section,
4

4

00:00:07.625  -->  00:00:10.214
so the section that comes after the header,
5

5

00:00:10.214  -->  00:00:12.623
but there's a lot more to do in this section,
6

6

00:00:12.623  -->  00:00:15.652
and so in this lecture, or to be more precise,
7

7

00:00:15.652  -->  00:00:17.223
while we build this section,
8

8

00:00:17.223  -->  00:00:20.024
which is actually gonna take more than just one lecture,
9

9

00:00:20.024  -->  00:00:22.708
you are gonna learn how to think about components
10

10

00:00:22.708  -->  00:00:26.852
and where to place our code in the overall CSS architecture.
11

11

00:00:26.852  -->  00:00:29.378
You'll also learn about utility classes,
12

12

00:00:29.378  -->  00:00:31.816
how to use the background-clip property,
13

13

00:00:31.816  -->  00:00:33.276
especially with text,
14

14

00:00:33.276  -->  00:00:36.998
how to transform multiple properties at the same time,
15

15

00:00:36.998  -->  00:00:39.158
how to use the outline-offset property
16

16

00:00:39.158  -->  00:00:42.116
together with outline, and finally,
17

17

00:00:42.116  -->  00:00:44.851
how to style elements that are not hovered
18

18

00:00:44.851  -->  00:00:47.244
while other elements are, and this will give us
19

19

00:00:47.244  -->  00:00:51.011
a really cool effect as you will see.
20

20

00:00:51.011  -->  00:00:53.891
So, this is the section that we're gonna build next.
21

21

00:00:53.891  -->  00:00:56.211
So we started with the header here,
22

22

00:00:56.211  -->  00:00:59.320
and then now, we're going to build this section here.
23

23

00:00:59.320  -->  00:01:01.552
Now before writing a single line of code,
24

24

00:01:01.552  -->  00:01:05.245
let's remember our think, build, architect mindset
25

25

00:01:05.245  -->  00:01:07.653
that we talked about before, right?
26

26

00:01:07.653  -->  00:01:09.324
So let's think and break it down
27

27

00:01:09.324  -->  00:01:11.536
what we have to build in this section.
28

28

00:01:11.536  -->  00:01:13.419
So first up, we have this heading here,
29

29

00:01:13.419  -->  00:01:15.803
and so this is an element of the typography,
30

30

00:01:15.803  -->  00:01:18.195
and this here as well, so this is another heading,
31

31

00:01:18.195  -->  00:01:20.013
and this is simply a paragraph.
32

32

00:01:20.013  -->  00:01:21.625
And so, these should probably go
33

33

00:01:21.625  -->  00:01:24.425
into our typography file, right?
34

34

00:01:24.425  -->  00:01:27.394
Then we also have this small button here, okay.
35

35

00:01:27.394  -->  00:01:29.727
So think of this as a secondary button,
36

36

00:01:29.727  -->  00:01:32.664
so up here, we have the main button, okay,
37

37

00:01:32.664  -->  00:01:34.236
and then here, we have this,
38

38

00:01:34.236  -->  00:01:37.660
like this smaller secondary button, so that's the left side,
39

39

00:01:37.660  -->  00:01:39.822
and actually, this is already using the grid,
40

40

00:01:39.822  -->  00:01:41.547
so we have two columns here, one on the left,
41

41

00:01:41.547  -->  00:01:43.384
and one on the right, okay?
42

42

00:01:43.384  -->  00:01:44.298
And see here on this side,
43

43

00:01:44.298  -->  00:01:48.472
we have this image composition here, so these three images
44

44

00:01:48.472  -->  00:01:51.210
where the one that we hover comes to the top,
45

45

00:01:51.210  -->  00:01:52.697
and the other ones become smaller.
46

46

00:01:52.697  -->  00:01:53.768
You see it?
47

47

00:01:53.768  -->  00:01:55.576
So we hover, this one becomes bigger,
48

48

00:01:55.576  -->  00:01:57.334
and the other one become smaller,
49

49

00:01:57.334  -->  00:02:00.290
and we also have this green border around the image,
50

50

00:02:00.290  -->  00:02:01.636
so that's all so that I can show you
51

51

00:02:01.636  -->  00:02:03.705
a couple more CSS properties
52

52

00:02:03.705  -->  00:02:07.042
which you can then use on your own sites in the future.
53

53

00:02:07.042  -->  00:02:09.540
So this part here, this image composition,
54

54

00:02:09.540  -->  00:02:12.561
I'm going to treat it as a component actually,
55

55

00:02:12.561  -->  00:02:16.297
so a reusable piece of code, or let's say, a module,
56

56

00:02:16.297  -->  00:02:18.865
that we can use on other parts of our site,
57

57

00:02:18.865  -->  00:02:21.863
like imagine that this natures company is going to grow
58

58

00:02:21.863  -->  00:02:24.865
and they will have a bigger website with lots of pages,
59

59

00:02:24.865  -->  00:02:27.144
and then, maybe we're going to want to use
60

60

00:02:27.144  -->  00:02:29.095
this image composition here somewhere else,
61

61

00:02:29.095  -->  00:02:31.538
so on the other pages, and so we should build this
62

62

00:02:31.538  -->  00:02:34.354
as a single component which will stay independent
63

63

00:02:34.354  -->  00:02:37.347
and also, in its own file.
64

64

00:02:37.347  -->  00:02:39.655
Okay, so that's what we're going to build here.
65

65

00:02:39.655  -->  00:02:41.829
Also we need to set some styles for this,
66

66

00:02:41.829  -->  00:02:44.692
this section, this oval section, right, this container
67

67

00:02:44.692  -->  00:02:47.451
where all of this is going to be inside, right?
68

68

00:02:47.451  -->  00:02:50.830
So you see it has this slightly gray background here,
69

69

00:02:50.830  -->  00:02:53.431
so this outside here, we have the white background.
70

70

00:02:53.431  -->  00:02:56.046
Then here, this is slightly gray, okay.
71

71

00:02:56.046  -->  00:02:59.042
And so, we also have to have some styles for that.
72

72

00:02:59.042  -->  00:03:01.362
All right, so let's start with the HTML
73

73

00:03:01.362  -->  00:03:03.195
such as we did before.
74

74

00:03:04.048  -->  00:03:06.829
So in here, we have the header first,
75

75

00:03:06.829  -->  00:03:10.268
and so let's now create a main element.
76

76

00:03:10.268  -->  00:03:12.534
So this is another HTML5 element,
77

77

00:03:12.534  -->  00:03:14.217
and this is just to tell search engines,
78

78

00:03:14.217  -->  00:03:16.469
or screen readers that this is really
79

79

00:03:16.469  -->  00:03:18.407
the main part of our site.
80

80

00:03:18.407  -->  00:03:19.542
So we have the header.
81

81

00:03:19.542  -->  00:03:20.738
We have then the main part,
82

82

00:03:20.738  -->  00:03:22.708
which will contain the rest of the website,
83

83

00:03:22.708  -->  00:03:23.721
and then finally, at the end,
84

84

00:03:23.721  -->  00:03:26.531
we're also gonna have a footer, okay?
85

85

00:03:26.531  -->  00:03:28.310
So this is like just a huge container
86

86

00:03:28.310  -->  00:03:30.789
which will contain most of our website
87

87

00:03:30.789  -->  00:03:32.613
because that's the main part.
88

88

00:03:32.613  -->  00:03:34.670
Now before we continue writing HTML,
89

89

00:03:34.670  -->  00:03:37.133
there is actually something that I want to show you,
90

90

00:03:37.133  -->  00:03:41.416
and that's called Emmet, and this is basically
91

91

00:03:41.416  -->  00:03:44.935
an extension that you can install on your text editor.
92

92

00:03:44.935  -->  00:03:47.721
I can bracket and add them in in Sublime,
93

93

00:03:47.721  -->  00:03:50.211
and of course, also in Visual Studio code.
94

94

00:03:50.211  -->  00:03:51.991
It's like an extension which allows us
95

95

00:03:51.991  -->  00:03:54.657
to write HTML a lot faster.
96

96

00:03:54.657  -->  00:03:57.723
And so, from this part on, I am going to start using that
97

97

00:03:57.723  -->  00:03:59.980
because this is actually a CSS course,
98

98

00:03:59.980  -->  00:04:01.525
and I don't want to spend so much time
99

99

00:04:01.525  -->  00:04:03.723
writing all this HTML and make you lose your time
100

100

00:04:03.723  -->  00:04:06.126
by watching me typing all this HTML.
101

101

00:04:06.126  -->  00:04:08.554
And so, I'm gonna use this Emmet extension
102

102

00:04:08.554  -->  00:04:10.933
and I highly encourage you to try it as well,
103

103

00:04:10.933  -->  00:04:13.030
and so do it alongside with me
104

104

00:04:13.030  -->  00:04:14.912
because this will make your life a lot easier
105

105

00:04:14.912  -->  00:04:17.299
when writing HTML, and it's very simple.
106

106

00:04:17.299  -->  00:04:19.933
There's just two or three rules that you need to know
107

107

00:04:19.933  -->  00:04:21.749
and then you're good to go and it will make
108

108

00:04:21.749  -->  00:04:24.011
your coding a lot faster in HTML.
109

109

00:04:24.011  -->  00:04:27.665
So imagine that you want to write a div with the class test.
110

110

00:04:27.665  -->  00:04:31.428
All you have to do is write dot test,
111

111

00:04:31.428  -->  00:04:34.488
and then hit Tab, and that's it.
112

112

00:04:34.488  -->  00:04:37.587
So it wrote a div with a class of test,
113

113

00:04:37.587  -->  00:04:40.674
and it already closed this div element for you as well,
114

114

00:04:40.674  -->  00:04:44.422
and so now, you can start writing the HTML in here,
115

115

00:04:44.422  -->  00:04:45.755
so great, right.
116

116

00:04:46.723  -->  00:04:48.907
So for a div, you can just start
117

117

00:04:48.907  -->  00:04:50.728
with a dot and then the class.
118

118

00:04:50.728  -->  00:04:52.362
Now if you want another element,
119

119

00:04:52.362  -->  00:04:54.061
like a section like we want now,
120

120

00:04:54.061  -->  00:04:55.216
you actually have to write the name
121

121

00:04:55.216  -->  00:04:59.145
of the HTML element first, so section,
122

122

00:04:59.145  -->  00:05:03.762
and now, the class, dot, and I'm gonna call this section,
123

123

00:05:03.762  -->  00:05:06.962
the section about, and now I hit Tab, remember?
124

124

00:05:06.962  -->  00:05:08.179
And that's it.
125

125

00:05:08.179  -->  00:05:11.419
So now we have a section called section-about.
126

126

00:05:11.419  -->  00:05:12.649
Got that?
127

127

00:05:12.649  -->  00:05:15.139
So again, I highly encourage you to go download
128

128

00:05:15.139  -->  00:05:17.079
that package for your text editor
129

129

00:05:17.079  -->  00:05:18.761
so that you can follow along with me
130

130

00:05:18.761  -->  00:05:20.770
as I type the code this way.
131

131

00:05:20.770  -->  00:05:22.515
All right, so let's now start
132

132

00:05:22.515  -->  00:05:25.674
with the h2 element actually that we talked about before,
133

133

00:05:25.674  -->  00:05:30.390
so h2 dot, I'm gonna call it heading-secondary.
134

134

00:05:30.390  -->  00:05:32.859
Remember we already have a heading-primary for the h1
135

135

00:05:32.859  -->  00:05:36.276
and so this one is the heading-secondary.
136

136

00:05:37.171  -->  00:05:38.479
So I'm using Emmet here again.
137

137

00:05:38.479  -->  00:05:41.565
Now I hit, Tab, and that's it.
138

138

00:05:41.565  -->  00:05:43.148
So the text here is
139

139

00:05:44.168  -->  00:05:47.335
Exciting tours for adventurous people.
140

140

00:05:51.735  -->  00:05:55.844
Okay, so let's start by styling actually this section.
141

141

00:05:55.844  -->  00:05:58.444
And where should we put this in our CSS architecture?
142

142

00:05:58.444  -->  00:05:59.695
What do you think?
143

143

00:05:59.695  -->  00:06:02.569
Well, I'm going to put it in the home.scss file.
144

144

00:06:02.569  -->  00:06:04.447
That's because this is a style
145

145

00:06:04.447  -->  00:06:06.593
very specific to the homepage,
146

146

00:06:06.593  -->  00:06:09.627
so this landing page that we're coding currently.
147

147

00:06:09.627  -->  00:06:11.274
So nowhere else on this entire website,
148

148

00:06:11.274  -->  00:06:13.643
even if it grows to many more pages,
149

149

00:06:13.643  -->  00:06:16.444
nowhere else there will be a section-about,
150

150

00:06:16.444  -->  00:06:18.292
at least not one similar to this,
151

151

00:06:18.292  -->  00:06:21.667
and so this is a specific style of our homepage,
152

152

00:06:21.667  -->  00:06:24.141
and this is why I'm putting it right here,
153

153

00:06:24.141  -->  00:06:25.558
so section-about.
154

154

00:06:29.579  -->  00:06:32.114
And let's start with the background color here, okay.
155

155

00:06:32.114  -->  00:06:33.697
So background-color
156

156

00:06:34.712  -->  00:06:37.149
and now we have a color here, so once again,
157

157

00:06:37.149  -->  00:06:40.047
let's declare a variable for that.
158

158

00:06:40.047  -->  00:06:42.107
So we have a very light gray,
159

159

00:06:42.107  -->  00:06:44.107
and so I'm gonna call it
160

160

00:06:45.862  -->  00:06:47.279
color-gray-light,
161

161

00:06:50.971  -->  00:06:53.212
and actually I'm gonna call it one
162

162

00:06:53.212  -->  00:06:54.874
because I already know that there will be
163

163

00:06:54.874  -->  00:06:57.124
multiple gray colors, okay?
164

164

00:06:58.033  -->  00:06:58.866
So f7f7f7.
165

165

00:07:00.421  -->  00:07:02.773
This is a very nice and subtle gray color,
166

166

00:07:02.773  -->  00:07:05.327
very similar to white, but it gives us a little bit,
167

167

00:07:05.327  -->  00:07:08.221
a very subtle contrast to the white color,
168

168

00:07:08.221  -->  00:07:11.388
and so let's copy that name, actually,
169

169

00:07:12.278  -->  00:07:14.015
and put it here.
170

170

00:07:14.015  -->  00:07:14.848
Good.
171

171

00:07:14.848  -->  00:07:16.265
Now some padding,
172

172

00:07:17.159  -->  00:07:20.492
so let's put 25rem let's say, on the top
173

173

00:07:21.332  -->  00:07:23.281
and also on the bottom, okay.
174

174

00:07:23.281  -->  00:07:27.448
So I'm using 25rem here because, let me show you why.
175

175

00:07:28.854  -->  00:07:30.510
This is our page.
176

176

00:07:30.510  -->  00:07:31.707
And here we go.
177

177

00:07:31.707  -->  00:07:34.855
So you see that our section is starting right here,
178

178

00:07:34.855  -->  00:07:36.091
where it actually makes sense,
179

179

00:07:36.091  -->  00:07:38.833
so right after this header right, so we have this header,
180

180

00:07:38.833  -->  00:07:41.632
and then from here is where our section starts,
181

181

00:07:41.632  -->  00:07:42.968
but this gives us this problem
182

182

00:07:42.968  -->  00:07:47.625
that we have this wide wedge here, so this triangle,
183

183

00:07:47.625  -->  00:07:49.451
and we want to get rid of that,
184

184

00:07:49.451  -->  00:07:54.383
and so we need to somehow move up this entire part.
185

185

00:07:54.383  -->  00:07:56.626
Now how much is this here, actually?
186

186

00:07:56.626  -->  00:07:59.137
There's actually a way to find out,
187

187

00:07:59.137  -->  00:08:03.148
so let's take a look, and it is in the header file.
188

188

00:08:03.148  -->  00:08:06.908
So you see that the height of the header is 95vh,
189

189

00:08:06.908  -->  00:08:10.150
so 95% of the height of the viewport,
190

190

00:08:10.150  -->  00:08:12.699
and then we know that this polygon on the right side
191

191

00:08:12.699  -->  00:08:14.616
goes until 75vh, right?
192

192

00:08:16.448  -->  00:08:18.948
So from here to here, it's 75,
193

193

00:08:20.981  -->  00:08:24.981
and from here to here, so like to here, it's 95,
194

194

00:08:25.825  -->  00:08:27.938
and so the difference has to be 20,
195

195

00:08:27.938  -->  00:08:31.188
so 20vh is the difference, 95 minus 75.
196

196

00:08:32.852  -->  00:08:34.518
Make sense?
197

197

00:08:34.518  -->  00:08:36.595
So let's then do that.
198

198

00:08:36.595  -->  00:08:37.970
And to move up this entire thing,
199

199

00:08:37.970  -->  00:08:41.576
we can actually specify the top margin.
200

200

00:08:41.576  -->  00:08:44.900
So margin-top, and then we give it a negative margin,
201

201

00:08:44.900  -->  00:08:48.596
and so instead of moving down, it moves up.
202

202

00:08:48.596  -->  00:08:50.763
Vh, and let's take a look.
203

203

00:08:52.111  -->  00:08:54.158
And so, here we go, so now,
204

204

00:08:54.158  -->  00:08:57.430
it moved here up until this point.
205

205

00:08:57.430  -->  00:08:58.792
Now we have a lot of space down here,
206

206

00:08:58.792  -->  00:09:02.310
but we can always change and fix that later.
207

207

00:09:02.310  -->  00:09:06.477
So for now, let's just worry about this h2 here, right?
208

208

00:09:07.829  -->  00:09:11.389
So as we were saying, this h2 is part of our typography,
209

209

00:09:11.389  -->  00:09:12.963
so let's go to that file
210

210

00:09:12.963  -->  00:09:15.546
and write our heading-secondary
211

211

00:09:16.626  -->  00:09:18.209
block in there, so.
212

212

00:09:23.715  -->  00:09:27.262
So let's start with some basic styles like the font size.
213

213

00:09:27.262  -->  00:09:29.845
Font-size 3.5rem, so 35 pixels.
214

214

00:09:32.047  -->  00:09:34.380
Text-transform of uppercase.
215

215

00:09:37.095  -->  00:09:41.095
Okay and let's say we want a font-weight of 700,
216

216

00:09:42.470  -->  00:09:45.916
so it's quite a bold text like this, okay.
217

217

00:09:45.916  -->  00:09:47.999
So let's take a look now,
218

218

00:09:49.573  -->  00:09:50.980
and here we go.
219

219

00:09:50.980  -->  00:09:55.071
Now what's special about the h2 that we're gonna do
220

220

00:09:55.071  -->  00:09:59.116
is take a look, like crazy style here when we hover it.
221

221

00:09:59.116  -->  00:10:03.248
This is just to show you some more CSS stuff.
222

222

00:10:03.248  -->  00:10:05.996
But what's really cool here is actually this gradient,
223

223

00:10:05.996  -->  00:10:08.952
so this gradient color that we have going on here
224

224

00:10:08.952  -->  00:10:10.345
right inside the text,
225

225

00:10:10.345  -->  00:10:12.607
so you see this side here is this light green.
226

226

00:10:12.607  -->  00:10:16.212
It moves all the way to our darkest green,
227

227

00:10:16.212  -->  00:10:17.479
so this is a really nice effect.
228

228

00:10:17.479  -->  00:10:19.980
I think it looks really modern,
229

229

00:10:19.980  -->  00:10:22.485
and so, let me show you how to do it.
230

230

00:10:22.485  -->  00:10:25.499
So the trick is to first set the background
231

231

00:10:25.499  -->  00:10:29.666
of the entire h2, so of this entire element to a gradient.
232

232

00:10:32.878  -->  00:10:35.572
So the background image will be a linear gradient,
233

233

00:10:35.572  -->  00:10:37.187
and we have done that before,
234

234

00:10:37.187  -->  00:10:39.051
so we want it to go to the right,
235

235

00:10:39.051  -->  00:10:41.205
so basically, from the left to right,
236

236

00:10:41.205  -->  00:10:45.372
and the colors are remember, or color-primary-light,
237

237

00:10:48.969  -->  00:10:50.886
and color-primary-dark.
238

238

00:10:56.268  -->  00:10:58.592
Remember, we defined them here before.
239

239

00:10:58.592  -->  00:11:01.259
So color primary light and dark.
240

240

00:11:02.328  -->  00:11:05.133
Let me actually close this one here.
241

241

00:11:05.133  -->  00:11:08.188
That makes sense as well and the package,
242

242

00:11:08.188  -->  00:11:12.009
and also the grid, so not too many files open here now.
243

243

00:11:12.009  -->  00:11:15.009
That's better, so let's take a look.
244

244

00:11:16.940  -->  00:11:18.424
And all right.
245

245

00:11:18.424  -->  00:11:21.624
Now what we want next is this gradient only to go
246

246

00:11:21.624  -->  00:11:24.422
all until this here, so we want it to stop
247

247

00:11:24.422  -->  00:11:26.535
where the text stops, basically.
248

248

00:11:26.535  -->  00:11:28.165
So how can we do that this element
249

249

00:11:28.165  -->  00:11:31.887
does not occupy 100% of its available width?
250

250

00:11:31.887  -->  00:11:33.465
So right now, it's a block element,
251

251

00:11:33.465  -->  00:11:36.463
and that's why it does that, but if we change it,
252

252

00:11:36.463  -->  00:11:38.024
it will no longer do it,
253

253

00:11:38.024  -->  00:11:40.514
and what do we have to change it to?
254

254

00:11:40.514  -->  00:11:43.681
That's right, so display inline-block,
255

255

00:11:45.300  -->  00:11:47.998
and if you take a look now,
256

256

00:11:47.998  -->  00:11:49.980
that's much better.
257

257

00:11:49.980  -->  00:11:52.389
Okay, and now the next step in making
258

258

00:11:52.389  -->  00:11:55.964
that effect happen with the gradient behind the text.
259

259

00:11:55.964  -->  00:11:57.427
So what we're gonna do is to use
260

260

00:11:57.427  -->  00:12:00.632
the brand new webkit background-clip property,
261

261

00:12:00.632  -->  00:12:02.613
and it's so new that we actually have to use
262

262

00:12:02.613  -->  00:12:05.113
just webkit prefix, so webkit,
263

263

00:12:07.271  -->  00:12:09.116
background-clip.
264

264

00:12:09.116  -->  00:12:12.699
All right, so we set this property to text.
265

265

00:12:13.678  -->  00:12:15.163
And so what happens now is that
266

266

00:12:15.163  -->  00:12:19.155
the background gets clipped exactly where the text is,
267

267

00:12:19.155  -->  00:12:22.282
so again, we set this background-clip property to text,
268

268

00:12:22.282  -->  00:12:24.940
and what this is going to do is that it will clip
269

269

00:12:24.940  -->  00:12:26.941
the background, and in this case,
270

270

00:12:26.941  -->  00:12:29.661
that's this linear-gradient, it will clip it
271

271

00:12:29.661  -->  00:12:32.243
to exactly the places where the text sits,
272

272

00:12:32.243  -->  00:12:35.011
and so therefore this background image or this gradient
273

273

00:12:35.011  -->  00:12:37.664
will only be visible where the text is.
274

274

00:12:37.664  -->  00:12:40.845
Now what we want to see then is to not actually the text,
275

275

00:12:40.845  -->  00:12:42.380
but the background image,
276

276

00:12:42.380  -->  00:12:45.057
so imagine that right now we have the background image
277

277

00:12:45.057  -->  00:12:47.376
only where the text is, then on top of that,
278

278

00:12:47.376  -->  00:12:50.789
we have the text, so let's make the text transparent
279

279

00:12:50.789  -->  00:12:52.937
so that we can see the background image,
280

280

00:12:52.937  -->  00:12:54.854
so the linear-gradient.
281

281

00:12:56.395  -->  00:12:57.638
So what we can do is very simply
282

282

00:12:57.638  -->  00:13:00.481
set the color to transparent.
283

283

00:13:00.481  -->  00:13:02.168
And that's it.
284

284

00:13:02.168  -->  00:13:04.774
Let's check it out now.
285

285

00:13:04.774  -->  00:13:06.024
And here we go.
286

286

00:13:07.040  -->  00:13:08.993
So, that's our effect.
287

287

00:13:08.993  -->  00:13:11.506
Let me just inspect this one
288

288

00:13:11.506  -->  00:13:15.203
and show you what happens if we do not do this one's parent.
289

289

00:13:15.203  -->  00:13:17.308
Then what happens is that you see the text
290

290

00:13:17.308  -->  00:13:20.201
which sits on top of the clipped background,
291

291

00:13:20.201  -->  00:13:23.136
and so we want to make this text invisible, so transparent,
292

292

00:13:23.136  -->  00:13:26.494
and so now, you can see this really nice gradient,
293

293

00:13:26.494  -->  00:13:28.385
so that's gonna take care of this,
294

294

00:13:28.385  -->  00:13:31.364
like this crazy fact that we have going on here, right?
295

295

00:13:31.364  -->  00:13:32.364
So this one.
296

296

00:13:34.084  -->  00:13:38.251
Let's go back here, and so now, this happens on hover.
297

297

00:13:39.213  -->  00:13:41.758
So by now, you already know how to do it.
298

298

00:13:41.758  -->  00:13:44.447
We have the sass nesting,
299

299

00:13:44.447  -->  00:13:48.797
so this will translate to heading-secondary and &amp;hover.
300

300

00:13:48.797  -->  00:13:50.492
So these effects that you saw,
301

301

00:13:50.492  -->  00:13:53.008
these are basically transform, and on transform,
302

302

00:13:53.008  -->  00:13:54.951
we can actually put multiple things
303

303

00:13:54.951  -->  00:13:57.223
at the same time that you want to transform.
304

304

00:13:57.223  -->  00:14:01.008
So you already saw translate, translate x and y.
305

305

00:14:01.008  -->  00:14:02.430
You already saw scale.
306

306

00:14:02.430  -->  00:14:04.408
You also saw rotate already.
307

307

00:14:04.408  -->  00:14:08.074
So now, let's use skew, so we can skew in the x direction
308

308

00:14:08.074  -->  00:14:10.221
as well as in the y direction,
309

309

00:14:10.221  -->  00:14:12.187
so let's start with the y direction.
310

310

00:14:12.187  -->  00:14:16.670
So skew Y, and in here, we specify it in degrees,
311

311

00:14:16.670  -->  00:14:19.170
so let's just say two degrees.
312

312

00:14:20.149  -->  00:14:21.830
Let's take a look at what happens.
313

313

00:14:21.830  -->  00:14:25.997
Now before that, let's also add a transition property here.
314

314

00:14:27.487  -->  00:14:31.654
Transition property, and set it to all, point two seconds.
315

315

00:14:33.674  -->  00:14:34.789
Also to make it a bit nicer,
316

316

00:14:34.789  -->  00:14:38.407
we will also add some more letter spacing here.
317

317

00:14:38.407  -->  00:14:41.324
Letter-spacing two pixels.
318

318

00:14:41.324  -->  00:14:45.296
Now I'm using pixels here and not rem, so why is that?
319

319

00:14:45.296  -->  00:14:48.311
Well, two pixels is such a small thing
320

320

00:14:48.311  -->  00:14:51.860
that it doesn't really matter if it's gonna scale or not.
321

321

00:14:51.860  -->  00:14:56.356
It's actually the exact same thing if I do point two rem,
322

322

00:14:56.356  -->  00:14:59.217
because no matter if we increase the root font size or not,
323

323

00:14:59.217  -->  00:15:02.611
this will probably always translate to just two pixels
324

324

00:15:02.611  -->  00:15:04.478
because of rounding issues,
325

325

00:15:04.478  -->  00:15:07.311
but okay, let's keep it like that.
326

326

00:15:08.179  -->  00:15:09.621
Okay.
327

327

00:15:09.621  -->  00:15:13.911
All right, and so that is skewing in the y direction.
328

328

00:15:13.911  -->  00:15:16.793
Let's actually change this to like 20 degrees
329

329

00:15:16.793  -->  00:15:20.628
so that we can see a more dramatic effect.
330

330

00:15:20.628  -->  00:15:23.096
So something like this.
331

331

00:15:23.096  -->  00:15:26.137
So it's not only rotating, it's really skewing
332

332

00:15:26.137  -->  00:15:27.887
all of these letters.
333

333

00:15:30.865  -->  00:15:34.048
Now we can also do it in the x direction,
334

334

00:15:34.048  -->  00:15:37.390
and sometimes this makes for really, really cool effects.
335

335

00:15:37.390  -->  00:15:41.802
We'll actually see another application of this a bit later.
336

336

00:15:41.802  -->  00:15:44.411
I'll just put 15 degrees in here now,
337

337

00:15:44.411  -->  00:15:46.661
so let's take a look again.
338

338

00:15:48.815  -->  00:15:53.180
And now, it does these two at the same time.
339

339

00:15:53.180  -->  00:15:54.775
Let me just show you what would happen
340

340

00:15:54.775  -->  00:15:56.525
if it was only on the
341

341

00:15:58.423  -->  00:15:59.767
on the y direction.
342

342

00:15:59.767  -->  00:16:02.229
No, actually on the x direction, sorry.
343

343

00:16:02.229  -->  00:16:06.396
So, on the x direction only, it looks like this, okay?
344

344

00:16:08.732  -->  00:16:11.698
So let's put it back here, two degrees,
345

345

00:16:11.698  -->  00:16:15.061
and now, we can also at the same time scale it a little bit.
346

346

00:16:15.061  -->  00:16:19.100
So one point one for example, so it becomes 110%.
347

347

00:16:19.100  -->  00:16:21.232
Also some text shadow beneath it,
348

348

00:16:21.232  -->  00:16:23.330
and this time we can do it in two directions,
349

349

00:16:23.330  -->  00:16:26.236
so in the x direction, let's go five pixels,
350

350

00:16:26.236  -->  00:16:29.736
so point five rem, and in the y direction,
351

351

00:16:30.603  -->  00:16:34.770
one rem, so 10 pixel, and 20 pixels of blur, so two rem.
352

352

00:16:36.347  -->  00:16:38.264
And now the color, rgba
353

353

00:16:42.024  -->  00:16:43.398
and color-black, and now,
354

354

00:16:43.398  -->  00:16:46.536
let's give it like 20% opacity.
355

355

00:16:46.536  -->  00:16:49.240
So point two, all right.
356

356

00:16:49.240  -->  00:16:51.441
So let's take a look now.
357

357

00:16:51.441  -->  00:16:53.711
And all right, so that looks pretty much
358

358

00:16:53.711  -->  00:16:56.794
like the one we have in our original.
359

359

00:16:57.988  -->  00:16:59.721
Now one last thing is that we should actually
360

360

00:16:59.721  -->  00:17:02.228
center this entire thing here, right?
361

361

00:17:02.228  -->  00:17:03.709
And the way that I prefer to do this
362

362

00:17:03.709  -->  00:17:06.245
is to wrap this element into a parent element
363

363

00:17:06.245  -->  00:17:08.224
and then, center the text from there,
364

364

00:17:08.224  -->  00:17:10.023
so let me show that to you and actually
365

365

00:17:10.023  -->  00:17:14.314
introduce you to a new concept called utility classes.
366

366

00:17:14.314  -->  00:17:18.064
So let's actually put a div around this here,
367

367

00:17:19.070  -->  00:17:19.903
and the class that we're gonna
368

368

00:17:19.903  -->  00:17:23.070
put here will be called u-center-text.
369

369

00:17:29.731  -->  00:17:33.315
What this class does is that it will very simply
370

370

00:17:33.315  -->  00:17:36.565
center the text, which is inside of it.
371

371

00:17:39.164  -->  00:17:41.547
Let me adjust this here a bit now.
372

372

00:17:41.547  -->  00:17:44.920
So as I was saying, this is a utility class,
373

373

00:17:44.920  -->  00:17:48.159
and utility classes are very simple classes in CSS,
374

374

00:17:48.159  -->  00:17:51.770
which only have one simple goal, and in this case,
375

375

00:17:51.770  -->  00:17:54.816
it will simply be to center text.
376

376

00:17:54.816  -->  00:17:56.272
And why did I do it?
377

377

00:17:56.272  -->  00:17:58.001
Why didn't I simply call it like
378

378

00:17:58.001  -->  00:18:00.520
heading-secondary-parent or something like that?
379

379

00:18:00.520  -->  00:18:03.149
Well I didn't do that because I want to reuse
380

380

00:18:03.149  -->  00:18:06.775
this piece of CSS here, so this class,
381

381

00:18:06.775  -->  00:18:08.800
which will have this CSS attached,
382

382

00:18:08.800  -->  00:18:10.209
and also, it wouldn't make much sense
383

383

00:18:10.209  -->  00:18:13.444
to make a whole class just for centering
384

384

00:18:13.444  -->  00:18:15.432
this piece of text, right?
385

385

00:18:15.432  -->  00:18:17.827
And so, utility classes are a great tool
386

386

00:18:17.827  -->  00:18:21.382
that we should use and have in our toolbox,
387

387

00:18:21.382  -->  00:18:23.184
so actually, we already created
388

388

00:18:23.184  -->  00:18:26.531
this file here for utilities, and so let's put it down here.
389

389

00:18:26.531  -->  00:18:27.948
So u-center-text.
390

390

00:18:31.708  -->  00:18:33.413
I think that was the name, right?
391

391

00:18:33.413  -->  00:18:36.261
I remember, u-center-text, yeah, right.
392

392

00:18:36.261  -->  00:18:39.928
And so actually, we just need one line here.
393

393

00:18:41.859  -->  00:18:42.942
So text-align
394

394

00:18:44.642  -->  00:18:46.009
center, that's it.
395

395

00:18:46.009  -->  00:18:48.993
And so now the text that we have here will become centered,
396

396

00:18:48.993  -->  00:18:51.857
and that's because this is a inline block element now.
397

397

00:18:51.857  -->  00:18:54.294
Remember this heading-secondary,
398

398

00:18:54.294  -->  00:18:56.323
we defined it as an inline block,
399

399

00:18:56.323  -->  00:18:59.838
and so, if we set the parent to text-align-center,
400

400

00:18:59.838  -->  00:19:01.767
then that inline block element inside it
401

401

00:19:01.767  -->  00:19:05.409
is treated as text and will therefore be centered
402

402

00:19:05.409  -->  00:19:08.160
in the parent, so let's take a look at that,
403

403

00:19:08.160  -->  00:19:10.143
and indeed, here it is.
404

404

00:19:10.143  -->  00:19:12.567
All right, so we're making great progress.
405

405

00:19:12.567  -->  00:19:14.067
Let's now move on,
406

406

00:19:15.124  -->  00:19:16.759
and let's start by actually
407

407

00:19:16.759  -->  00:19:18.359
using our grid for the first time,
408

408

00:19:18.359  -->  00:19:20.461
so we have these two columns here,
409

409

00:19:20.461  -->  00:19:23.294
so let's just implement them here.
410

410

00:19:24.210  -->  00:19:27.613
So as I was saying, we can now come here simply
411

411

00:19:27.613  -->  00:19:29.599
and copy this markup we already have
412

412

00:19:29.599  -->  00:19:31.599
here from our grid test.
413

413

00:19:33.582  -->  00:19:37.415
Now we just have to fix this fomentation here.
414

414

00:19:40.947  -->  00:19:42.150
But that's not a big problem.
415

415

00:19:42.150  -->  00:19:43.140
There are actually some extensions
416

416

00:19:43.140  -->  00:19:45.270
that you can download for your text editor
417

417

00:19:45.270  -->  00:19:48.929
which will take this pain of fomenting it from you.
418

418

00:19:48.929  -->  00:19:53.111
All right, so let's just put some text here.
419

419

00:19:53.111  -->  00:19:55.769
My text content will go in here
420

420

00:19:55.769  -->  00:19:59.769
and in here, we will have our image composition.
421

421

00:20:02.913  -->  00:20:05.248
Actually take a look in here.
422

422

00:20:05.248  -->  00:20:06.803
And indeed, here we are.
423

423

00:20:06.803  -->  00:20:08.118
Okay, and so when we did this,
424

424

00:20:08.118  -->  00:20:10.877
we actually forgot to remove these colors here,
425

425

00:20:10.877  -->  00:20:12.535
so let's quickly do that,
426

426

00:20:12.535  -->  00:20:14.646
and open up our grid file again,
427

427

00:20:14.646  -->  00:20:17.197
and let's create gray gradients
428

428

00:20:17.197  -->  00:20:21.065
of this background color, and of this one.
429

429

00:20:21.065  -->  00:20:22.315
Save and close.
430

430

00:20:23.549  -->  00:20:27.340
Now another thing that I noticed here was
431

431

00:20:27.340  -->  00:20:29.307
this lack of space that we have here,
432

432

00:20:29.307  -->  00:20:33.413
so we should have some space between the h2 element
433

433

00:20:33.413  -->  00:20:36.669
and of course, the content that comes after it.
434

434

00:20:36.669  -->  00:20:38.980
Now we could quickly go ahead and simply add
435

435

00:20:38.980  -->  00:20:42.671
some margin to our heading-secondary element, right?
436

436

00:20:42.671  -->  00:20:44.602
And that would be no problem in doing so,
437

437

00:20:44.602  -->  00:20:48.187
but the thing is that we can already start thinking ahead,
438

438

00:20:48.187  -->  00:20:52.340
and so, let's take a look at what we have here.
439

439

00:20:52.340  -->  00:20:54.667
So there is another h2 here.
440

440

00:20:54.667  -->  00:20:56.368
There's another one.
441

441

00:20:56.368  -->  00:20:58.184
There's another one,
442

442

00:20:58.184  -->  00:21:01.192
and let me show you where another one is,
443

443

00:21:01.192  -->  00:21:02.623
and it's here, okay,
444

444

00:21:02.623  -->  00:21:04.830
and what you're starting to notice now is that
445

445

00:21:04.830  -->  00:21:08.263
the spacing that's behind them is not always the same,
446

446

00:21:08.263  -->  00:21:09.889
and that actually makes a lot of sense,
447

447

00:21:09.889  -->  00:21:11.961
because remember, we wanted this element
448

448

00:21:11.961  -->  00:21:14.104
or this block to be independent
449

449

00:21:14.104  -->  00:21:16.134
and reusable across the page,
450

450

00:21:16.134  -->  00:21:19.248
but if we now go ahead and add a margin to the bottom
451

451

00:21:19.248  -->  00:21:21.561
of let's say 80 pixels or something,
452

452

00:21:21.561  -->  00:21:23.644
then that would influence the way that we could use
453

453

00:21:23.644  -->  00:21:25.984
the secondary heading across our page.
454

454

00:21:25.984  -->  00:21:30.903
So for example here, we don't want any of that margin.
455

455

00:21:30.903  -->  00:21:32.660
And I think, also in here,
456

456

00:21:32.660  -->  00:21:34.817
it's a different margin here as well,
457

457

00:21:34.817  -->  00:21:39.095
and so, what we should do in this specific place
458

458

00:21:39.095  -->  00:21:41.762
is to use another utility class.
459

459

00:21:43.332  -->  00:21:45.819
So we're gonna use another utility class here,
460

460

00:21:45.819  -->  00:21:49.736
and this one will be called u-margin-bottom-80,
461

461

00:21:52.684  -->  00:21:54.903
or eight actually for eight rem,
462

462

00:21:54.903  -->  00:21:56.869
so here we have another utility class
463

463

00:21:56.869  -->  00:21:58.153
which allows us to very easily
464

464

00:21:58.153  -->  00:22:00.360
set some margins across our page
465

465

00:22:00.360  -->  00:22:03.134
in a very simple way, which at the same time,
466

466

00:22:03.134  -->  00:22:06.504
allow our main components, or blocks, or elements
467

467

00:22:06.504  -->  00:22:10.256
to stay independent and reusable across the page.
468

468

00:22:10.256  -->  00:22:13.282
So that's the reason why we used this utility class here,
469

469

00:22:13.282  -->  00:22:15.211
and that's the reason why we're going to use
470

470

00:22:15.211  -->  00:22:17.069
this utility class as well.
471

471

00:22:17.069  -->  00:22:20.885
And so what I want you to do is to always think like this.
472

472

00:22:20.885  -->  00:22:23.203
That's why I'm insisting so much all the time
473

473

00:22:23.203  -->  00:22:26.455
in these reusable, independent, and all of that stuff, okay?
474

474

00:22:26.455  -->  00:22:29.112
It's because I want you to get used to this notion,
475

475

00:22:29.112  -->  00:22:32.434
to this way of thinking about our interfaces.
476

476

00:22:32.434  -->  00:22:36.601
Okay, with that in mind, let's define actually this class.
477

477

00:22:40.880  -->  00:22:42.213
So margin-bottom
478

478

00:22:44.844  -->  00:22:45.844
80, or 8rem.
479

479

00:22:48.763  -->  00:22:51.329
And so, of course later, when we come to that popup
480

480

00:22:51.329  -->  00:22:53.513
that I just showed you, we will then have to define
481

481

00:22:53.513  -->  00:22:56.217
another utility class for that specific margin
482

482

00:22:56.217  -->  00:22:57.708
that we want by rem.
483

483

00:22:57.708  -->  00:22:58.905
Does that make sense?
484

484

00:22:58.905  -->  00:23:00.783
So let's just check it out,
485

485

00:23:00.783  -->  00:23:01.783
and finally,
486

486

00:23:04.288  -->  00:23:08.623
and yeah, so now we have some nice spacing going on here.
487

487

00:23:08.623  -->  00:23:11.515
All right, and that should be enough for one lecture.
488

488

00:23:11.515  -->  00:23:13.573
Let's leave the other stuff that we want to do
489

489

00:23:13.573  -->  00:23:15.091
so putting the text content here,
490

490

00:23:15.091  -->  00:23:16.882
and the image composition on this side.
491

491

00:23:16.882  -->  00:23:18.711
Let's leave that for the next lecture
492

492

00:23:18.711  -->  00:23:21.128
so that you can take a break.
