00:00:01,219  -->  00:00:03,460
<v Narrator>The first step in moving on in our project</v>
2

2

00:00:03,460  -->  00:00:06,703
is to actually convert the CSS code
3

3

00:00:06,703  -->  00:00:09,508
that we've been writing so far to a SASS code.
4

4

00:00:09,508  -->  00:00:11,970
And so we're gonna set up a couple of variables
5

5

00:00:11,970  -->  00:00:16,348
and we're also gonna nest selectors where that makes sense.
6

6

00:00:16,348  -->  00:00:18,876
And so here we are back in our SASS code.
7

7

00:00:18,876  -->  00:00:20,399
And actually we already have a lot
8

8

00:00:20,399  -->  00:00:24,081
of variables here going on so mainly with the colors.
9

9

00:00:24,081  -->  00:00:26,573
But let's see if we can find some more.
10

10

00:00:26,573  -->  00:00:29,010
So I think for the colors we already
11

11

00:00:29,010  -->  00:00:31,551
have variables for everything, right.
12

12

00:00:31,551  -->  00:00:34,349
I don't really see another color going on here.
13

13

00:00:34,349  -->  00:00:36,636
Oh, actually here it's black.
14

14

00:00:36,636  -->  00:00:40,303
So why not also having a variable for black?
15

15

00:00:41,340  -->  00:00:42,840
So color of black.
16

16

00:00:43,815  -->  00:00:46,885
Again, later down the road we may decide
17

17

00:00:46,885  -->  00:00:49,925
that the black that we want is not really complete black
18

18

00:00:49,925  -->  00:00:53,742
but maybe only some really dark gray.
19

19

00:00:53,742  -->  00:00:56,052
And then we would have to change all of that manually.
20

20

00:00:56,052  -->  00:00:59,156
And so it's better to always have a variable
21

21

00:00:59,156  -->  00:01:03,982
so that we can change it very easily and very quickly.
22

22

00:01:03,982  -->  00:01:07,840
And so now I can replace it here, color black,
23

23

00:01:07,840  -->  00:01:10,673
and of course the same thing here.
24

24

00:01:12,872  -->  00:01:15,399
Now again, doing so with the RGBA,
25

25

00:01:15,399  -->  00:01:18,028
identifying a hexadecimal color in
26

26

00:01:18,028  -->  00:01:20,098
here only works with SASS.
27

27

00:01:20,098  -->  00:01:23,090
So in regular CSS we really have to define
28

28

00:01:23,090  -->  00:01:26,477
the colors here separately for R, G, and B,
29

29

00:01:26,477  -->  00:01:29,760
with a number ranging between zero and 255
30

30

00:01:29,760  -->  00:01:31,170
such as we had before.
31

31

00:01:31,170  -->  00:01:33,773
But now in SASS we can put the hexadecimal,
32

32

00:01:33,773  -->  00:01:37,070
a number here like we have with the black color,
33

33

00:01:37,070  -->  00:01:40,900
and then the RGBA function is still going to work.
34

34

00:01:40,900  -->  00:01:44,104
Alright, and there are no more color variables here.
35

35

00:01:44,104  -->  00:01:46,676
Now some people like to go really crazy here
36

36

00:01:46,676  -->  00:01:49,470
and also specify variables for all of this stuff
37

37

00:01:49,470  -->  00:01:53,271
like family, weight, line height, and all of that,
38

38

00:01:53,271  -->  00:01:56,044
but I think that's not really necessary because in fact
39

39

00:01:56,044  -->  00:01:59,967
we're only ever specifying this code once here.
40

40

00:01:59,967  -->  00:02:02,152
So we're not having this Lato font-family
41

41

00:02:02,152  -->  00:02:04,834
all over the place it's really just here.
42

42

00:02:04,834  -->  00:02:07,635
And so in fact we're only defining it in one place
43

43

00:02:07,635  -->  00:02:10,650
and so there's no need to have a variable, alright.
44

44

00:02:10,650  -->  00:02:13,240
Now remember that we're still having here in the background
45

45

00:02:13,240  -->  00:02:17,190
this terminal running where we're still detecting
46

46

00:02:17,190  -->  00:02:20,971
all the time if we're doing some changes to our SASS code.
47

47

00:02:20,971  -->  00:02:22,732
And then each time we change anything
48

48

00:02:22,732  -->  00:02:25,685
it actually reloads the page, right.
49

49

00:02:25,685  -->  00:02:28,267
And so all of the changes that we did already
50

50

00:02:28,267  -->  00:02:30,580
should be reflected in here.
51

51

00:02:30,580  -->  00:02:33,587
And so during the development of this entire project
52

52

00:02:33,587  -->  00:02:35,765
I will just keep this running in the background
53

53

00:02:35,765  -->  00:02:37,653
and we don't have to worry about this anymore.
54

54

00:02:37,653  -->  00:02:39,981
So this is our development setup.
55

55

00:02:39,981  -->  00:02:42,494
And now that we have a variable setup at least for now
56

56

00:02:42,494  -->  00:02:46,058
let's take a look at nesting our selectors.
57

57

00:02:46,058  -->  00:02:48,945
So remember that we're using the BM methodology
58

58

00:02:48,945  -->  00:02:51,897
so a block element modifier and so we're using
59

59

00:02:51,897  -->  00:02:54,853
all of these really low specificity selectors.
60

60

00:02:54,853  -->  00:02:58,099
So we have header, header logo box, header text box
61

61

00:02:58,099  -->  00:02:59,994
and so on and so forth.
62

62

00:02:59,994  -->  00:03:02,416
And so when we select its elements we always do
63

63

00:03:02,416  -->  00:03:04,108
this just with a class selector.
64

64

00:03:04,108  -->  00:03:06,375
And so all of our selectors they're really
65

65

00:03:06,375  -->  00:03:10,218
just only one class selector with one class.
66

66

00:03:10,218  -->  00:03:12,017
So they all have the same specificity,
67

67

00:03:12,017  -->  00:03:13,969
which is extremely low.
68

68

00:03:13,969  -->  00:03:17,450
Also, since each and every element actually has a class,
69

69

00:03:17,450  -->  00:03:19,620
nesting can be a bit difficult here, right.
70

70

00:03:19,620  -->  00:03:22,645
It looks like there's not much to nest here, right?
71

71

00:03:22,645  -->  00:03:24,596
It's different from the example that we had
72

72

00:03:24,596  -->  00:03:27,872
when we first looked at SASS where we did simply nest
73

73

00:03:27,872  -->  00:03:29,943
all the elements like we had.
74

74

00:03:29,943  -->  00:03:33,688
Remember, UL, and then in there we had the LI,
75

75

00:03:33,688  -->  00:03:36,310
and then in there we had the A.
76

76

00:03:36,310  -->  00:03:39,434
So right now we don't have that kind of structure
77

77

00:03:39,434  -->  00:03:42,044
because every element has its own class.
78

78

00:03:42,044  -->  00:03:44,530
But still we can do nesting here.
79

79

00:03:44,530  -->  00:03:46,354
And I'm gonna show you how.
80

80

00:03:46,354  -->  00:03:48,029
And this is how we do it.
81

81

00:03:48,029  -->  00:03:51,889
So remember what ampersand operator does,
82

82

00:03:51,889  -->  00:03:54,183
it basically, it copies this selector here
83

83

00:03:54,183  -->  00:03:56,607
that we have up until this point, right.
84

84

00:03:56,607  -->  00:03:59,025
So actually all of this.
85

85

00:03:59,025  -->  00:04:03,668
So it's not header, so if we now want to specify this
86

86

00:04:03,668  -->  00:04:08,196
decoration block here we can actually write it this way.
87

87

00:04:08,196  -->  00:04:10,113
Logo-box and that's it.
88

88

00:04:14,967  -->  00:04:18,467
So we copy the coding here and here we go.
89

89

00:04:20,163  -->  00:04:22,485
So this is now nested inside each other
90

90

00:04:22,485  -->  00:04:25,514
and the code when compiled will be exactly the same.
91

91

00:04:25,514  -->  00:04:29,405
Because again, this header here is like it's copied here.
92

92

00:04:29,405  -->  00:04:30,994
So I imagine that if we copy it
93

93

00:04:30,994  -->  00:04:32,843
and then we place it here,
94

94

00:04:32,843  -->  00:04:35,332
and so it looks exactly the way we had before.
95

95

00:04:35,332  -->  00:04:36,187
Right?
96

96

00:04:36,187  -->  00:04:38,653
And so instead of having to write header all the time
97

97

00:04:38,653  -->  00:04:41,532
in each single element that we want to select,
98

98

00:04:41,532  -->  00:04:44,077
we can just use nesting like this.
99

99

00:04:44,077  -->  00:04:46,516
So, let's put these all together here,
100

100

00:04:46,516  -->  00:04:50,179
all of these which have to do with the header.
101

101

00:04:50,179  -->  00:04:53,693
So it's all of these and then we can just replace
102

102

00:04:53,693  -->  00:04:57,730
the header with the ampersand operator.
103

103

00:04:57,730  -->  00:04:59,754
Now here in Visual Studio Code,
104

104

00:04:59,754  -->  00:05:02,831
when I select something and then hit CMND + D
105

105

00:05:02,831  -->  00:05:04,370
it will automatically select the
106

106

00:05:04,370  -->  00:05:06,465
next instance which is the same.
107

107

00:05:06,465  -->  00:05:08,908
So you see here I have header selected
108

108

00:05:08,908  -->  00:05:10,683
and you see that already down here
109

109

00:05:10,683  -->  00:05:12,302
it's becoming with a different color
110

110

00:05:12,302  -->  00:05:15,894
and now if I hit CMND + D then it also gets selected.
111

111

00:05:15,894  -->  00:05:18,945
And you see these two cursors here blinking.
112

112

00:05:18,945  -->  00:05:20,842
So we have multiple cursors now
113

113

00:05:20,842  -->  00:05:22,902
and if I now write the ampersand it
114

114

00:05:22,902  -->  00:05:25,069
will replace both of them.
115

115

00:05:26,257  -->  00:05:29,598
Alright, so again, this is not really a CSS feature
116

116

00:05:29,598  -->  00:05:32,162
but it's a feature of this text editor.
117

117

00:05:32,162  -->  00:05:34,602
And I know that Adam does this as well
118

118

00:05:34,602  -->  00:05:36,420
and probably also brackets.
119

119

00:05:36,420  -->  00:05:39,004
And I know that sublime text also does it.
120

120

00:05:39,004  -->  00:05:40,702
And so you can try to figure out how
121

121

00:05:40,702  -->  00:05:43,354
your text editor does this trick.
122

122

00:05:43,354  -->  00:05:44,893
It's really handy sometimes to replace
123

123

00:05:44,893  -->  00:05:48,684
multiple instances of the same text all at the same time.
124

124

00:05:48,684  -->  00:05:50,359
Alright, and so that's it.
125

125

00:05:50,359  -->  00:05:53,167
So, I really like this approach with nesting
126

126

00:05:53,167  -->  00:05:55,749
the selectors like this because you see is like
127

127

00:05:55,749  -->  00:05:59,916
really all encapsulated all in this big, one header block.
128

128

00:06:00,832  -->  00:06:01,665
Okay?
129

129

00:06:01,665  -->  00:06:04,034
So when scanning down our code we can see okay,
130

130

00:06:04,034  -->  00:06:07,227
this I the header then inside we have these declarations
131

131

00:06:07,227  -->  00:06:09,561
for the header and then from there we move down
132

132

00:06:09,561  -->  00:06:13,519
to this element logo box logo and text box.
133

133

00:06:13,519  -->  00:06:14,444
Okay?
134

134

00:06:14,444  -->  00:06:17,159
So let's save this and let's actually take a look at the
135

135

00:06:17,159  -->  00:06:20,770
styles CSS and so here you see that actually
136

136

00:06:20,770  -->  00:06:23,976
what I explained to you is exactly what is working.
137

137

00:06:23,976  -->  00:06:26,503
So you have to the header declaration block,
138

138

00:06:26,503  -->  00:06:28,473
which starts here, ends here.
139

139

00:06:28,473  -->  00:06:31,130
Then we have the header logo box, the header logo.
140

140

00:06:31,130  -->  00:06:34,469
So exactly what we had before doing this nesting.
141

141

00:06:34,469  -->  00:06:35,356
Right?
142

142

00:06:35,356  -->  00:06:36,867
So we change this into SASS
143

143

00:06:36,867  -->  00:06:40,585
but it looks exactly the same in the output.
144

144

00:06:40,585  -->  00:06:42,489
So this is what we wanted.
145

145

00:06:42,489  -->  00:06:44,987
Now, the next thing here with the heading primary,
146

146

00:06:44,987  -->  00:06:48,553
so they can do the same here, right.
147

147

00:06:48,553  -->  00:06:50,881
So let's actually do it.
148

148

00:06:50,881  -->  00:06:55,048
All we have to do is to basically not that much code.
149

149

00:06:56,233  -->  00:06:57,752
Whoa, this is really fast.
150

150

00:06:57,752  -->  00:07:00,669
So cut this one and put it in here.
151

151

00:07:04,706  -->  00:07:06,761
It goes to this heading Primary Main,
152

152

00:07:06,761  -->  00:07:09,507
so the system modifier here right.
153

153

00:07:09,507  -->  00:07:12,639
And so now here such as we have before,
154

154

00:07:12,639  -->  00:07:16,147
I can replace it with the ampersand.
155

155

00:07:16,147  -->  00:07:17,316
And that's actually it.
156

156

00:07:17,316  -->  00:07:21,483
So it will be heading primary--main, and here --sub.
157

157

00:07:24,932  -->  00:07:26,599
Alright, make sense?
158

158

00:07:27,595  -->  00:07:30,745
So again it's just nicely encapsulated block,
159

159

00:07:30,745  -->  00:07:32,571
which now contains all of the code for
160

160

00:07:32,571  -->  00:07:35,988
the heading primary all at the same time.
161

161

00:07:37,102  -->  00:07:39,377
And we can now do the same thing here
162

162

00:07:39,377  -->  00:07:40,967
with the button of course.
163

163

00:07:40,967  -->  00:07:45,177
So we have button link, visited, hover, active,
164

164

00:07:45,177  -->  00:07:48,977
so these for sudo classes and then here there's modifier,
165

165

00:07:48,977  -->  00:07:50,787
and then this sudo element.
166

166

00:07:50,787  -->  00:07:53,858
And we can wrap them all into one huge block.
167

167

00:07:53,858  -->  00:07:54,844
Okay?
168

168

00:07:54,844  -->  00:07:56,277
So how do we do that?
169

169

00:07:56,277  -->  00:07:58,234
And actually I want you to do it.
170

170

00:07:58,234  -->  00:08:01,386
So it's a small challenge here so pause the video
171

171

00:08:01,386  -->  00:08:05,551
and try to nest all of this code into one huge block.
172

172

00:08:05,551  -->  00:08:08,432
Maybe it's not exactly easy at this point
173

173

00:08:08,432  -->  00:08:10,341
but it's a nice challenge and so I hope
174

174

00:08:10,341  -->  00:08:12,758
that you can manage to do it.
175

175

00:08:14,164  -->  00:08:16,208
Hopefully you manage to do that
176

176

00:08:16,208  -->  00:08:18,978
so let's go take a look at how I would do it.
177

177

00:08:18,978  -->  00:08:23,351
So actually let's start by just writing button here
178

178

00:08:23,351  -->  00:08:27,268
and then start by copying all of that in there.
179

179

00:08:33,571  -->  00:08:37,520
Okay, and so now we can just remove this here
180

180

00:08:37,520  -->  00:08:41,642
and let's again replace this with the ampersand operator.
181

181

00:08:41,642  -->  00:08:43,876
Now we'll start hitting CMND + D to select
182

182

00:08:43,876  -->  00:08:47,230
all of these button instances, okay.
183

183

00:08:47,230  -->  00:08:50,121
So button, button, and there's more.
184

184

00:08:50,121  -->  00:08:53,600
Button, button, okay, that's it.
185

185

00:08:53,600  -->  00:08:57,621
And so now replace all of these with the ampersand.
186

186

00:08:57,621  -->  00:09:01,773
Okay, so we have now button linked, button visited,
187

187

00:09:01,773  -->  00:09:05,139
button hover, button active, button wide,
188

188

00:09:05,139  -->  00:09:08,837
and button after, and button wide after,
189

189

00:09:08,837  -->  00:09:11,787
and button hover after, and button animate it.
190

190

00:09:11,787  -->  00:09:14,774
Okay, but this is still not perfect, right.
191

191

00:09:14,774  -->  00:09:16,446
Because we can do more.
192

192

00:09:16,446  -->  00:09:19,174
We can also replace this part here
193

193

00:09:19,174  -->  00:09:20,525
because it's already here.
194

194

00:09:20,525  -->  00:09:22,035
Make sense?
195

195

00:09:22,035  -->  00:09:24,535
So we can just do it like this.
196

196

00:09:24,535  -->  00:09:27,035
Copy this entire thing in here
197

197

00:09:28,334  -->  00:09:29,834
and take this out.
198

198

00:09:31,752  -->  00:09:32,723
Okay, make sense?
199

199

00:09:32,723  -->  00:09:34,413
So let's try to read that.
200

200

00:09:34,413  -->  00:09:37,666
So here we have this will translate to
201

201

00:09:37,666  -->  00:09:39,974
button--wide and then here it
202

202

00:09:39,974  -->  00:09:43,082
will translate to button--wide,
203

203

00:09:43,082  -->  00:09:45,582
and then the after sudo class.
204

204

00:09:47,173  -->  00:09:48,006
Okay?
205

205

00:09:49,269  -->  00:09:50,486
Does it make sense?
206

206

00:09:50,486  -->  00:09:53,303
Now we can do the same thing in here.
207

207

00:09:53,303  -->  00:09:57,386
So let's go to the hover part, which is up there.
208

208

00:10:01,194  -->  00:10:02,527
And put it here.
209

209

00:10:07,944  -->  00:10:10,382
Alright, so again this was repeated this part.
210

210

00:10:10,382  -->  00:10:11,365
Right?
211

211

00:10:11,365  -->  00:10:12,984
So let me put it back very shortly.
212

212

00:10:12,984  -->  00:10:16,332
So this was already here, so why write it again?
213

213

00:10:16,332  -->  00:10:18,430
We can just take it out and replace it
214

214

00:10:18,430  -->  00:10:21,527
with the ampersand operator here.
215

215

00:10:21,527  -->  00:10:25,864
And so this gonna translate to button hover after.
216

216

00:10:25,864  -->  00:10:28,365
And I think that now we're good.
217

217

00:10:28,365  -->  00:10:31,130
Now everything is nicely nested
218

218

00:10:31,130  -->  00:10:33,208
and I think it makes a lot more sense like this.
219

219

00:10:33,208  -->  00:10:34,755
It's easier to read and it's all
220

220

00:10:34,755  -->  00:10:38,647
encapsulated in the small block that we have.
221

221

00:10:38,647  -->  00:10:41,124
Now I know that it may take some time to get used to,
222

222

00:10:41,124  -->  00:10:43,718
to this nesting and to make sense out of it
223

223

00:10:43,718  -->  00:10:45,572
but you'll see that with practice
224

224

00:10:45,572  -->  00:10:48,411
and maybe with all the practice that you're gonna take
225

225

00:10:48,411  -->  00:10:50,366
while we're building this project,
226

226

00:10:50,366  -->  00:10:52,042
after that it will make sense to you
227

227

00:10:52,042  -->  00:10:55,595
and you will be so used to it that it's no problem anymore.
228

228

00:10:55,595  -->  00:10:57,602
Just one last final check,
229

229

00:10:57,602  -->  00:11:00,606
see if everything is still working and yes it is.
230

230

00:11:00,606  -->  00:11:03,063
So our button works exactly the same as before.
231

231

00:11:03,063  -->  00:11:05,252
So all the logic was preserved even
232

232

00:11:05,252  -->  00:11:07,406
after we changed all of this code here.
233

233

00:11:07,406  -->  00:11:08,756
Okay?
234

234

00:11:08,756  -->  00:11:10,555
So that was my goal for this lecture,
235

235

00:11:10,555  -->  00:11:13,138
so we're now ready to move on.
