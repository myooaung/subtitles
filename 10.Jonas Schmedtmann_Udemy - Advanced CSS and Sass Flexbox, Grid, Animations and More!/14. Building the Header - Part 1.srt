00:00:01,659  -->  00:00:04,424
<v Instructor>Welcome to the next part of the project,</v>
2

2

00:00:04,424  -->  00:00:07,754
which is to finally build the header.
3

3

00:00:07,754  -->  00:00:09,771
And so in this lecture, you will learn
4

4

00:00:09,771  -->  00:00:11,858
how to manage vertical spacing
5

5

00:00:11,858  -->  00:00:13,951
in a completely responsive layout using
6

6

00:00:13,951  -->  00:00:16,638
some more advanced CSS Grid techniques.
7

7

00:00:16,638  -->  00:00:19,244
And also, you will use the before and after
8

8

00:00:19,244  -->  00:00:21,744
pseudo elements as grid items.
9

9

00:00:22,677  -->  00:00:26,108
So in this header, we have the logo of the company.
10

10

00:00:26,108  -->  00:00:28,373
Then we have this H3 element here,
11

11

00:00:28,373  -->  00:00:30,363
which we already styled before.
12

12

00:00:30,363  -->  00:00:33,917
Then this main text here, which is the H1 element,
13

13

00:00:33,917  -->  00:00:36,844
so the main heading of this entire page.
14

14

00:00:36,844  -->  00:00:39,199
And then just this button that we also
15

15

00:00:39,199  -->  00:00:40,728
already styled before.
16

16

00:00:40,728  -->  00:00:43,246
And then down here we have this thing
17

17

00:00:43,246  -->  00:00:46,054
which gives the page some social proof.
18

18

00:00:46,054  -->  00:00:48,542
So basically these four companies here,
19

19

00:00:48,542  -->  00:00:51,456
they talked about this website and this company.
20

20

00:00:51,456  -->  00:00:53,772
And so we're including that on our page here.
21

21

00:00:53,772  -->  00:00:56,708
And that's how many startups actually do it these days.
22

22

00:00:56,708  -->  00:00:58,702
So when you see a modern page of startup,
23

23

00:00:58,702  -->  00:01:02,279
you usually have these icons of some websites
24

24

00:01:02,279  -->  00:01:04,647
that wrote an article about them.
25

25

00:01:04,647  -->  00:01:07,470
So let's put all of that in our markup now
26

26

00:01:07,470  -->  00:01:10,339
so that we can then, after that, style it.
27

27

00:01:10,339  -->  00:01:14,506
So here in our header, the first thing is the image.
28

28

00:01:15,446  -->  00:01:17,779
And it's called header logo.
29

29

00:01:18,855  -->  00:01:22,355
And the source is also simply called logo.
30

30

00:01:27,648  -->  00:01:30,481
Okay, then next up we have this H3
31

31

00:01:34,502  -->  00:01:37,396
with the heading three class, right?
32

32

00:01:37,396  -->  00:01:39,479
And so this one here says
33

33

00:01:41,613  -->  00:01:42,780
your own home.
34

34

00:01:44,046  -->  00:01:48,213
And then we have the H1, with the heading one class.
35

35

00:01:49,748  -->  00:01:54,173
We didn't style this one yet, so we're gonna do that next.
36

36

00:01:54,173  -->  00:01:57,590
So it says the ultimate personal freedom.
37

37

00:01:58,584  -->  00:02:02,167
Okay, then the button, view our properties.
38

38

00:02:06,908  -->  00:02:11,075
Next up we have the text, which says as seen on, right?
39

39

00:02:12,600  -->  00:02:15,447
So basically we have an element just for this
40

40

00:02:15,447  -->  00:02:17,845
and then an element which is going to contain
41

41

00:02:17,845  -->  00:02:19,262
these four logos.
42

42

00:02:20,723  -->  00:02:24,890
So header, seen on, and I'm gonna call this one here text,
43

43

00:02:33,375  -->  00:02:36,387
and this one here is just seen on logos.
44

44

00:02:36,387  -->  00:02:39,428
So image, and right now I'm going to give these
45

45

00:02:39,428  -->  00:02:41,909
here a class because I think that having
46

46

00:02:41,909  -->  00:02:44,908
this more complex class here is already more than enough.
47

47

00:02:44,908  -->  00:02:48,195
And we can then simply select the img in there.
48

48

00:02:48,195  -->  00:02:51,556
And actually here we're missing the header.
49

49

00:02:51,556  -->  00:02:54,284
And so yeah, that's correct.
50

50

00:02:54,284  -->  00:02:55,951
So img and logo BBC.
51

51

00:03:01,829  -->  00:03:02,662
Okay.
52

52

00:03:07,873  -->  00:03:10,540
Then we have Forbes, TechCrunch,
53

53

00:03:13,523  -->  00:03:17,106
and Business Insider, two, three, and four.
54

54

00:03:19,617  -->  00:03:22,751
All right, let's take a look at that.
55

55

00:03:22,751  -->  00:03:23,936
And here we go.
56

56

00:03:23,936  -->  00:03:25,450
Now of course all of this is huge.
57

57

00:03:25,450  -->  00:03:27,058
But we're gonna take care of that in a second.
58

58

00:03:27,058  -->  00:03:29,682
Let's start with our H1 element here.
59

59

00:03:29,682  -->  00:03:33,155
And so let's close the footer and the sidebar
60

60

00:03:33,155  -->  00:03:36,406
and open our typography file here,
61

61

00:03:36,406  -->  00:03:39,281
because that's where the heading are.
62

62

00:03:39,281  -->  00:03:43,448
So the heading number one, we want a font size of 4.5 rem.
63

63

00:03:45,282  -->  00:03:49,032
We want the color to be the color gray light,
64

64

00:03:54,609  -->  00:03:57,102
okay, so basically almost white.
65

65

00:03:57,102  -->  00:04:00,358
And then also, just as we have here in the H2,
66

66

00:04:00,358  -->  00:04:03,144
we want the line height of one, okay?
67

67

00:04:03,144  -->  00:04:06,310
So for a situation when we have two lines
68

68

00:04:06,310  -->  00:04:08,089
here in this text, then we don't want
69

69

00:04:08,089  -->  00:04:11,730
all the spacing between these two lines.
70

70

00:04:11,730  -->  00:04:14,171
Okay, and that looks much better.
71

71

00:04:14,171  -->  00:04:16,201
And now let's take care of these images here
72

72

00:04:16,201  -->  00:04:18,731
so that we can then lay out this here
73

73

00:04:18,731  -->  00:04:20,889
using a CSS Grid.
74

74

00:04:20,889  -->  00:04:23,472
Okay, so it is our header file.
75

75

00:04:25,990  -->  00:04:28,990
And so let's add our selectors here.
76

76

00:04:30,250  -->  00:04:31,083
So logo,
77

77

00:04:35,154  -->  00:04:36,571
the seen on text,
78

78

00:04:42,402  -->  00:04:44,629
the seen on logos, and then, remember,
79

79

00:04:44,629  -->  00:04:49,267
in there, we are going to select the image text directly
80

80

00:04:49,267  -->  00:04:52,545
so we don't have a separate class for them here this time.
81

81

00:04:52,545  -->  00:04:57,018
Okay, so these images, they should all have the same height.
82

82

00:04:57,018  -->  00:04:58,935
So let's say 25 pixels.
83

83

00:04:59,962  -->  00:05:01,654
Okay, and we want them to have the same height
84

84

00:05:01,654  -->  00:05:05,185
because that's the way it looks better.
85

85

00:05:05,185  -->  00:05:06,520
So just like this.
86

86

00:05:06,520  -->  00:05:09,359
Imagine if we were to have them having the same width.
87

87

00:05:09,359  -->  00:05:10,629
Then it would have different heights,
88

88

00:05:10,629  -->  00:05:12,301
and that would look weird when they are
89

89

00:05:12,301  -->  00:05:14,840
side by side like this, okay?
90

90

00:05:14,840  -->  00:05:17,189
Now, as for the logo, let's give it a height
91

91

00:05:17,189  -->  00:05:19,606
of let's say three rem, okay?
92

92

00:05:21,881  -->  00:05:25,397
And so yeah, that looks much better as well.
93

93

00:05:25,397  -->  00:05:27,496
Also before we move on with the layout part,
94

94

00:05:27,496  -->  00:05:30,421
let's give this here its background image
95

95

00:05:30,421  -->  00:05:32,251
so that it looks just like this here,
96

96

00:05:32,251  -->  00:05:35,811
with this house as the background image.
97

97

00:05:35,811  -->  00:05:38,325
And so that's directly on the header element.
98

98

00:05:38,325  -->  00:05:40,325
And so background image.
99

99

00:05:42,628  -->  00:05:44,622
And again, we're going to use this trick
100

100

00:05:44,622  -->  00:05:46,448
where we have multiple backgrounds,
101

101

00:05:46,448  -->  00:05:48,801
where the first one is a linear gradient
102

102

00:05:48,801  -->  00:05:52,051
in order to make the image darker.
103

103

00:05:52,051  -->  00:05:56,218
So I'm gonna use RGBA and use the secondary color,
104

104

00:05:58,527  -->  00:06:02,694
so the blue one, and then give it a 93% alpha value.
105

105

00:06:03,674  -->  00:06:07,405
So going from this color basically to the same color.
106

106

00:06:07,405  -->  00:06:08,973
And so that's the best way, again,
107

107

00:06:08,973  -->  00:06:11,504
of creating an overlay for an image.
108

108

00:06:11,504  -->  00:06:14,504
And then after that, of course, img,
109

109

00:06:15,523  -->  00:06:18,273
and this one is called hero.jpeg.
110

110

00:06:20,944  -->  00:06:22,302
And this is actually not correct
111

111

00:06:22,302  -->  00:06:25,598
because we need to move out of the CSS folder first
112

112

00:06:25,598  -->  00:06:28,681
before we can go into the img folder.
113

113

00:06:31,533  -->  00:06:35,726
Now just set it to cover here, with the background size,
114

114

00:06:35,726  -->  00:06:38,476
and then we should be good to go.
115

115

00:06:40,669  -->  00:06:45,621
Okay, maybe just set it to centered, so the background
116

116

00:06:45,621  -->  00:06:47,204
position to center.
117

117

00:06:49,309  -->  00:06:51,252
And yeah, that looks a lot better.
118

118

00:06:51,252  -->  00:06:54,440
Okay, so now comes the time to create
119

119

00:06:54,440  -->  00:06:56,712
some spacing here between all of these elements
120

120

00:06:56,712  -->  00:06:59,215
and then also center them both vertically
121

121

00:06:59,215  -->  00:07:02,001
and horizontally here in this header element.
122

122

00:07:02,001  -->  00:07:04,704
So how would we have done that in the old days?
123

123

00:07:04,704  -->  00:07:07,762
So probably we would have just created a container
124

124

00:07:07,762  -->  00:07:09,528
for all of these elements.
125

125

00:07:09,528  -->  00:07:11,944
We would then have centered that container
126

126

00:07:11,944  -->  00:07:13,478
inside of the header.
127

127

00:07:13,478  -->  00:07:16,709
Then we would have just created some margins here,
128

128

00:07:16,709  -->  00:07:19,341
like margin bottoms, on these different elements
129

129

00:07:19,341  -->  00:07:20,995
to create some spacing.
130

130

00:07:20,995  -->  00:07:23,745
But with CSS Grid, we can do better than that.
131

131

00:07:23,745  -->  00:07:25,197
And that's because with a grid,
132

132

00:07:25,197  -->  00:07:27,281
we can define the line heights
133

133

00:07:27,281  -->  00:07:29,951
instead of having to define some margins.
134

134

00:07:29,951  -->  00:07:32,402
And so that's a lot easier, and it makes
135

135

00:07:32,402  -->  00:07:33,994
a lot more sense, I think.
136

136

00:07:33,994  -->  00:07:36,679
And so let's now go through that
137

137

00:07:36,679  -->  00:07:39,096
here for this header element.
138

138

00:07:40,081  -->  00:07:42,191
So this is my grid.
139

139

00:07:42,191  -->  00:07:44,211
And so we're gonna turn this entire header element
140

140

00:07:44,211  -->  00:07:46,571
into a grid container.
141

141

00:07:46,571  -->  00:07:50,030
And then we can define its rows.
142

142

00:07:50,030  -->  00:07:51,650
So template rows.
143

143

00:07:51,650  -->  00:07:53,734
Now, how are we going to do this?
144

144

00:07:53,734  -->  00:07:57,648
Let's take a look again at our final result here.
145

145

00:07:57,648  -->  00:08:00,088
And so we see that there's a lot of space here
146

146

00:08:00,088  -->  00:08:03,809
after this logo here and also a lot of space
147

147

00:08:03,809  -->  00:08:06,598
between this button and between this element here,
148

148

00:08:06,598  -->  00:08:08,993
which has as seen on, okay?
149

149

00:08:08,993  -->  00:08:12,833
But let's start here with this space after the logo.
150

150

00:08:12,833  -->  00:08:14,787
So imagine that we wanted to have the logo
151

151

00:08:14,787  -->  00:08:17,801
here on the top and then push all of these other
152

152

00:08:17,801  -->  00:08:19,372
elements here to the bottom.
153

153

00:08:19,372  -->  00:08:21,443
So how could we do that?
154

154

00:08:21,443  -->  00:08:24,539
Well, we could use the fractional unit.
155

155

00:08:24,539  -->  00:08:28,437
So one fr, and then simply allow all the other rows
156

156

00:08:28,437  -->  00:08:31,317
to be sized automatically.
157

157

00:08:31,317  -->  00:08:33,073
Okay, so let's take a quick look
158

158

00:08:33,073  -->  00:08:36,565
at how our grid looks like like this.
159

159

00:08:36,565  -->  00:08:39,603
Okay, and that's as expected, right?
160

160

00:08:39,603  -->  00:08:42,045
And let's reload this, because something here
161

161

00:08:42,045  -->  00:08:43,275
went wrong with the text.
162

162

00:08:43,275  -->  00:08:47,008
But anyway, this looks exactly as expected.
163

163

00:08:47,008  -->  00:08:50,175
So let's actually inspect this new grid
164

164

00:08:50,175  -->  00:08:51,675
that we have here.
165

165

00:08:52,894  -->  00:08:55,436
So this header, okay.
166

166

00:08:55,436  -->  00:08:58,451
And so this is how our grid looks like.
167

167

00:08:58,451  -->  00:08:59,478
So this here.
168

168

00:08:59,478  -->  00:09:01,998
So all this time, we've been using the fractional unit
169

169

00:09:01,998  -->  00:09:03,651
for the columns in order to fill up
170

170

00:09:03,651  -->  00:09:06,552
all the available space that is available, right?
171

171

00:09:06,552  -->  00:09:09,491
But of course we can do the same with the rows.
172

172

00:09:09,491  -->  00:09:12,238
And it works, in this case, because the grid container
173

173

00:09:12,238  -->  00:09:15,679
actually has a very well-defined height.
174

174

00:09:15,679  -->  00:09:19,395
And that height is this 80% of the view port height, right?
175

175

00:09:19,395  -->  00:09:21,198
So this entire row that we have here,
176

176

00:09:21,198  -->  00:09:23,414
this first row, which contains all of this,
177

177

00:09:23,414  -->  00:09:26,148
remember we defined that as being 80%
178

178

00:09:26,148  -->  00:09:28,538
of the view port height.
179

179

00:09:28,538  -->  00:09:30,649
So we have a container.
180

180

00:09:30,649  -->  00:09:32,965
So let me show that to you, just to remember.
181

181

00:09:32,965  -->  00:09:34,371
And so here we see.
182

182

00:09:34,371  -->  00:09:38,261
So the first row has 80% of view port height, okay?
183

183

00:09:38,261  -->  00:09:41,251
And so this entire row here is what that means.
184

184

00:09:41,251  -->  00:09:43,965
And therefore this header element here
185

185

00:09:43,965  -->  00:09:46,606
also has this 80% view port height.
186

186

00:09:46,606  -->  00:09:49,289
And so, again, this grid container here
187

187

00:09:49,289  -->  00:09:50,906
has a very well-defined height,
188

188

00:09:50,906  -->  00:09:54,058
which is 80% of the view port height.
189

189

00:09:54,058  -->  00:09:57,658
Okay, so if we now come into the header,
190

190

00:09:57,658  -->  00:10:00,148
and if we hadn't this definition here,
191

191

00:10:00,148  -->  00:10:01,611
then basically all of that space
192

192

00:10:01,611  -->  00:10:03,251
would be divided up equally.
193

193

00:10:03,251  -->  00:10:05,517
But that's not really what we want.
194

194

00:10:05,517  -->  00:10:07,467
Instead, in this very first example,
195

195

00:10:07,467  -->  00:10:09,916
we want this first row to occupy all
196

196

00:10:09,916  -->  00:10:11,465
of the empty space.
197

197

00:10:11,465  -->  00:10:13,539
And so we give it one fractional unit
198

198

00:10:13,539  -->  00:10:15,513
and then allow all the other rows
199

199

00:10:15,513  -->  00:10:18,004
to be sized automatically, okay?
200

200

00:10:18,004  -->  00:10:19,382
Does that make sense?
201

201

00:10:19,382  -->  00:10:21,951
Now, in order to add some space in here between them,
202

202

00:10:21,951  -->  00:10:25,165
we can of course use the grid gap property.
203

203

00:10:25,165  -->  00:10:27,080
And so that is the big advantage.
204

204

00:10:27,080  -->  00:10:29,148
Instead of having to add some margins
205

205

00:10:29,148  -->  00:10:30,913
to all of these child elements,
206

206

00:10:30,913  -->  00:10:33,532
we can simply do it right on the container,
207

207

00:10:33,532  -->  00:10:35,281
so right on the grid definition.
208

208

00:10:35,281  -->  00:10:36,984
And that's a lot easier than using,
209

209

00:10:36,984  -->  00:10:38,598
for example, something like Flexbox,
210

210

00:10:38,598  -->  00:10:40,080
or even the even older way
211

211

00:10:40,080  -->  00:10:42,913
that I described in the beginning.
212

212

00:10:44,206  -->  00:10:47,956
So grid row gap, and let's set it to 1.5 rem.
213

213

00:10:51,155  -->  00:10:54,818
Okay, and so that's even better than before.
214

214

00:10:54,818  -->  00:10:56,453
But we can do better than that.
215

215

00:10:56,453  -->  00:11:00,267
So let's add some space here after this row here.
216

216

00:11:00,267  -->  00:11:01,977
And so basically what we want here
217

217

00:11:01,977  -->  00:11:04,825
is to increase the row size, right?
218

218

00:11:04,825  -->  00:11:06,381
Because remember, we cannot really style
219

219

00:11:06,381  -->  00:11:08,592
these gaps here individually.
220

220

00:11:08,592  -->  00:11:12,281
And instead we can increase the row size.
221

221

00:11:12,281  -->  00:11:17,195
So let's set this here like to six rem, for example.
222

222

00:11:17,195  -->  00:11:20,328
And so the first row has this fractional unit.
223

223

00:11:20,328  -->  00:11:22,492
Then the second one we want to be sized
224

224

00:11:22,492  -->  00:11:24,224
according to the content.
225

225

00:11:24,224  -->  00:11:26,374
So let's use min content.
226

226

00:11:26,374  -->  00:11:29,624
And then the next one is six rem, okay?
227

227

00:11:30,958  -->  00:11:33,253
So let's check that out now.
228

228

00:11:33,253  -->  00:11:36,559
And yeah, so you see that now we have this more space
229

229

00:11:36,559  -->  00:11:38,129
here between these two.
230

230

00:11:38,129  -->  00:11:40,756
So that's starting to look more like our original.
231

231

00:11:40,756  -->  00:11:42,958
Now, next up we also want a lot of space here
232

232

00:11:42,958  -->  00:11:45,682
after this button, right?
233

233

00:11:45,682  -->  00:11:47,227
So just like this.
234

234

00:11:47,227  -->  00:11:49,659
And so let's say that we want this row here
235

235

00:11:49,659  -->  00:11:53,826
to be one fr, such as the row with the logo, okay?
236

236

00:11:54,846  -->  00:11:58,407
So six rem is this one with the text,
237

237

00:11:58,407  -->  00:12:02,574
and then the next one should be one fractional unit.
238

238

00:12:03,710  -->  00:12:06,539
And so that's what this is going to look like.
239

239

00:12:06,539  -->  00:12:08,529
Now this is, of course, not ideal.
240

240

00:12:08,529  -->  00:12:10,313
And it happens because this element
241

241

00:12:10,313  -->  00:12:14,465
always tries to span its entire grid cell, right?
242

242

00:12:14,465  -->  00:12:17,268
So we've been seeing this behavior here a lot of times.
243

243

00:12:17,268  -->  00:12:18,455
And so let's fix that.
244

244

00:12:18,455  -->  00:12:20,959
And we can do that using the align self
245

245

00:12:20,959  -->  00:12:24,114
and justify self properties here on this button.
246

246

00:12:24,114  -->  00:12:25,856
So how are we going to do that?
247

247

00:12:25,856  -->  00:12:28,839
Well, here in our index file,
248

248

00:12:28,839  -->  00:12:31,659
the button is of course this reusable button.
249

249

00:12:31,659  -->  00:12:33,744
And so it doesn't have any class.
250

250

00:12:33,744  -->  00:12:35,895
But right now I think I should give it one
251

251

00:12:35,895  -->  00:12:38,505
so that i can then apply these two properties
252

252

00:12:38,505  -->  00:12:41,819
that I just mentioned, so justify self and align self.
253

253

00:12:41,819  -->  00:12:44,819
So button and header button as well.
254

254

00:12:48,719  -->  00:12:52,636
So now let's put it here, right after the logo.
255

255

00:12:59,651  -->  00:13:01,841
And so what do we want here?
256

256

00:13:01,841  -->  00:13:04,424
We want align self to be start,
257

257

00:13:06,331  -->  00:13:08,227
and so we want it vertically at the top
258

258

00:13:08,227  -->  00:13:11,949
of the grid cell, and also horizontally,
259

259

00:13:11,949  -->  00:13:14,831
so justify self, and also at the start,
260

260

00:13:14,831  -->  00:13:16,843
so all the way to the left side.
261

261

00:13:16,843  -->  00:13:18,375
And that should fix it.
262

262

00:13:18,375  -->  00:13:19,989
And indeed it does.
263

263

00:13:19,989  -->  00:13:24,220
So this is our grid cell, and this is our grid item.
264

264

00:13:24,220  -->  00:13:27,945
Now actually let's give all of these here some padding.
265

265

00:13:27,945  -->  00:13:30,767
Okay, so to move it away here from the sides
266

266

00:13:30,767  -->  00:13:32,574
of the header.
267

267

00:13:32,574  -->  00:13:34,407
And so that's up here.
268

268

00:13:36,265  -->  00:13:39,915
So padding of eight rem, let's say.
269

269

00:13:39,915  -->  00:13:42,484
And so that's going to look much nicer.
270

270

00:13:42,484  -->  00:13:44,108
What I just want to change, though,
271

271

00:13:44,108  -->  00:13:47,204
is that I want to have some last padding here at the top,
272

272

00:13:47,204  -->  00:13:50,315
okay, so that the logo can be closer to the start
273

273

00:13:50,315  -->  00:13:51,394
of the page.
274

274

00:13:51,394  -->  00:13:53,918
And also I want to center this item here
275

275

00:13:53,918  -->  00:13:56,090
right into its grid cell.
276

276

00:13:56,090  -->  00:13:59,695
And so of course that should be pretty easy as well.
277

277

00:13:59,695  -->  00:14:02,626
So first let's say that we want padding at the top
278

278

00:14:02,626  -->  00:14:06,159
to be just four rem, and then the logo,
279

279

00:14:06,159  -->  00:14:09,326
let's justify self it to center, okay?
280

280

00:14:11,733  -->  00:14:14,566
And that makes total sense, right?
281

281

00:14:15,539  -->  00:14:18,206
All right, now if we remove this
282

282

00:14:20,639  -->  00:14:22,664
grid, this overlay grid here,
283

283

00:14:22,664  -->  00:14:24,090
then you will see that it doesn't really
284

284

00:14:24,090  -->  00:14:26,030
look so centered, right?
285

285

00:14:26,030  -->  00:14:29,348
So there's a lot of space going on here on this side.
286

286

00:14:29,348  -->  00:14:31,837
And that is happening because this column here
287

287

00:14:31,837  -->  00:14:34,552
is occupying all the available space.
288

288

00:14:34,552  -->  00:14:37,636
And so let's actually change that.
289

289

00:14:37,636  -->  00:14:39,762
And we're going to do that by saying
290

290

00:14:39,762  -->  00:14:42,010
that we want the column to only have the width
291

291

00:14:42,010  -->  00:14:43,593
of the min content.
292

292

00:14:46,245  -->  00:14:49,828
So template columns, and min content, okay,
293

293

00:14:51,239  -->  00:14:53,617
so we only have one column, of course,
294

294

00:14:53,617  -->  00:14:55,372
and we want it to be just the size
295

295

00:14:55,372  -->  00:14:59,974
that it has to have in order to fit the content.
296

296

00:14:59,974  -->  00:15:02,327
And well, that's not really right.
297

297

00:15:02,327  -->  00:15:04,153
But actually it makes total sense, okay?
298

298

00:15:04,153  -->  00:15:06,560
So remember that min content means
299

299

00:15:06,560  -->  00:15:09,943
that it's the smallest width possible, okay?
300

300

00:15:09,943  -->  00:15:12,054
But actually we don't want min content.
301

301

00:15:12,054  -->  00:15:14,545
We want max content.
302

302

00:15:14,545  -->  00:15:17,100
And so that is the one we're looking for.
303

303

00:15:17,100  -->  00:15:18,653
And yeah, that's much better.
304

304

00:15:18,653  -->  00:15:22,276
And so now it has the size in order to fit the content,
305

305

00:15:22,276  -->  00:15:24,810
and the largest piece of content is this here,
306

306

00:15:24,810  -->  00:15:27,306
without having to do any line breaks.
307

307

00:15:27,306  -->  00:15:29,989
So now, last thing to do is to then
308

308

00:15:29,989  -->  00:15:32,562
also center this entire grid track
309

309

00:15:32,562  -->  00:15:35,562
inside of the grid container, right?
310

310

00:15:36,698  -->  00:15:40,281
And so we do that by using justify content.
311

311

00:15:44,023  -->  00:15:46,773
Center, of course, and all right.
312

312

00:15:48,390  -->  00:15:49,661
So here we go.
313

313

00:15:49,661  -->  00:15:51,254
That's it.
314

314

00:15:51,254  -->  00:15:53,162
And if we remove, now, this overlay,
315

315

00:15:53,162  -->  00:15:55,788
then it looks a lot better.
316

316

00:15:55,788  -->  00:15:59,660
So it actually looks quite a lot like this already,
317

317

00:15:59,660  -->  00:16:01,196
just of course some more things
318

318

00:16:01,196  -->  00:16:04,644
that we have to do and to change,
319

319

00:16:04,644  -->  00:16:07,200
like for example doing this part here at the bottom.
320

320

00:16:07,200  -->  00:16:09,045
But I'm going to do that in the next video
321

321

00:16:09,045  -->  00:16:12,795
so that you can take a break if you want to.
