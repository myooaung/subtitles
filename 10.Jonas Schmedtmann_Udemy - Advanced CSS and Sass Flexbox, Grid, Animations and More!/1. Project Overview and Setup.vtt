00:00:01.026  -->  00:00:03.451
<v Narrator>Hello and welcome to the third big,</v>
2

2

00:00:03.451  -->  00:00:06.754
real-world project in this course.
3

3

00:00:06.754  -->  00:00:09.976
And so this one is of course, about CSS grids.
4

4

00:00:09.976  -->  00:00:14.133
So without further ado, let me show it to you.
5

5

00:00:14.133  -->  00:00:15.027
So here it is.
6

6

00:00:15.027  -->  00:00:18.271
This is the project that we're gonna code in this section.
7

7

00:00:18.271  -->  00:00:20.785
So this is the landing page of a fictional company
8

8

00:00:20.785  -->  00:00:24.715
called "nexter" which sells luxury home across the world.
9

9

00:00:24.715  -->  00:00:26.870
And so their slogan is your own home,
10

10

00:00:26.870  -->  00:00:29.182
the ultimate personal freedom.
11

11

00:00:29.182  -->  00:00:32.407
Okay, so once again, I designed and built
12

12

00:00:32.407  -->  00:00:35.455
this project specifically just for this course
13

13

00:00:35.455  -->  00:00:37.549
and the goal of this project is basically
14

14

00:00:37.549  -->  00:00:40.150
to use as many grids here as possible.
15

15

00:00:40.150  -->  00:00:43.889
Okay, so there are not these fancy effects going on
16

16

00:00:43.889  -->  00:00:45.456
like we had in the other project,
17

17

00:00:45.456  -->  00:00:48.708
but instead, I really focused on the CSS grid here.
18

18

00:00:48.708  -->  00:00:51.609
And so the entire layout of the page is of course
19

19

00:00:51.609  -->  00:00:54.744
a CSS grid and then I also used grids
20

20

00:00:54.744  -->  00:00:56.381
in many smaller components.
21

21

00:00:56.381  -->  00:00:58.378
Like, for example, here on this side here,
22

22

00:00:58.378  -->  00:01:03.237
we have a CSS grid, then this entire header works as a grid.
23

23

00:01:03.237  -->  00:01:04.694
For example, these elements here
24

24

00:01:04.694  -->  00:01:06.749
are also laid out in a grid.
25

25

00:01:06.749  -->  00:01:08.282
Of course, when you come down here,
26

26

00:01:08.282  -->  00:01:10.986
you see that this is also a grid here,
27

27

00:01:10.986  -->  00:01:14.364
and these images are also laid out as a grid,
28

28

00:01:14.364  -->  00:01:16.871
and so you see that all of these components here
29

29

00:01:16.871  -->  00:01:19.437
are really designed so that we can use grids
30

30

00:01:19.437  -->  00:01:21.399
in many different situations
31

31

00:01:21.399  -->  00:01:23.825
so that we can apply all of these properties
32

32

00:01:23.825  -->  00:01:25.717
that I showed you in the last section
33

33

00:01:25.717  -->  00:01:27.819
in real-world scenarios, okay.
34

34

00:01:27.819  -->  00:01:31.153
So this beautiful card here is also entirely coded up
35

35

00:01:31.153  -->  00:01:34.262
in grid and so you will see how easily it is actually
36

36

00:01:34.262  -->  00:01:35.849
to build it with grids.
37

37

00:01:35.849  -->  00:01:37.003
So you will see how little CSS
38

38

00:01:37.003  -->  00:01:39.088
we actually have to write, okay.
39

39

00:01:39.088  -->  00:01:40.474
Then down here, of course, you'll see
40

40

00:01:40.474  -->  00:01:42.030
this is yet another grid
41

41

00:01:42.030  -->  00:01:44.208
and that this time with a typical application
42

42

00:01:44.208  -->  00:01:47.348
which is like an image gallery like you have here,
43

43

00:01:47.348  -->  00:01:48.984
and then just a small footer, okay.
44

44

00:01:48.984  -->  00:01:51.968
And of course this entire thing is completely responsive,
45

45

00:01:51.968  -->  00:01:55.218
as well, so let's check that out, okay.
46

46

00:01:57.599  -->  00:02:01.182
So let's make it a bit smaller maybe, okay.
47

47

00:02:04.773  -->  00:02:07.004
So you see this is the page
48

48

00:02:07.004  -->  00:02:10.377
and then of course it's completely responsive, as well.
49

49

00:02:10.377  -->  00:02:13.155
So, for example, at this width here,
50

50

00:02:13.155  -->  00:02:17.405
you see that this changes from this three-column
51

51

00:02:17.405  -->  00:02:20.680
to these two columns here, okay.
52

52

00:02:20.680  -->  00:02:23.001
Down here also everything changes
53

53

00:02:23.001  -->  00:02:27.168
and here now you have two columns, as well, and yeah.
54

54

00:02:28.620  -->  00:02:31.453
You see that also the sidebar moved up here to the top
55

55

00:02:31.453  -->  00:02:33.669
and when we reduced this even further,
56

56

00:02:33.669  -->  00:02:37.525
then of course, we have this one-column layout, basically,
57

57

00:02:37.525  -->  00:02:40.706
with everything in a mobile view.
58

58

00:02:40.706  -->  00:02:43.489
Okay, so I hope you too are excited about this project.
59

59

00:02:43.489  -->  00:02:45.384
I really tried to make it beautiful again
60

60

00:02:45.384  -->  00:02:46.998
just like the other projects,
61

61

00:02:46.998  -->  00:02:48.887
so that you feel great about yourself
62

62

00:02:48.887  -->  00:02:51.839
once you finished it and show potential clients
63

63

00:02:51.839  -->  00:02:55.867
that you build this here with the new CSS grid technology.
64

64

00:02:55.867  -->  00:02:58.388
Okay, and so, I hope that you already downloaded
65

65

00:02:58.388  -->  00:03:00.641
the starter files to start with this project
66

66

00:03:00.641  -->  00:03:02.859
from the GitHub repository that I included
67

67

00:03:02.859  -->  00:03:04.549
in the beginning of the course.
68

68

00:03:04.549  -->  00:03:08.895
So I already have the starter files here on the desktop
69

69

00:03:08.895  -->  00:03:12.503
and I already have it opened here in VS Code, okay.
70

70

00:03:12.503  -->  00:03:13.959
So let's very quickly go through
71

71

00:03:13.959  -->  00:03:15.991
the starter files that I have here
72

72

00:03:15.991  -->  00:03:17.059
and this is actually very similar
73

73

00:03:17.059  -->  00:03:19.184
to the last Trilo project, okay.
74

74

00:03:19.184  -->  00:03:21.529
So we have a CSS folder, then we have the images
75

75

00:03:21.529  -->  00:03:24.861
and we actually have a lot of images this time, okay.
76

76

00:03:24.861  -->  00:03:26.730
Then we have the SASS folder and you notice
77

77

00:03:26.730  -->  00:03:30.072
that this time I already created the CSS files
78

78

00:03:30.072  -->  00:03:32.291
so that we don't have to create them one by one
79

79

00:03:32.291  -->  00:03:34.916
and they are already here, imported in this main file
80

80

00:03:34.916  -->  00:03:37.504
and so I don't have to do all this in the videos.
81

81

00:03:37.504  -->  00:03:39.373
And so you see that the architecture here is also
82

82

00:03:39.373  -->  00:03:41.997
slightly different than what we had in the last project.
83

83

00:03:41.997  -->  00:03:44.341
So I have now one file for each part
84

84

00:03:44.341  -->  00:03:46.199
of the website, basically,
85

85

00:03:46.199  -->  00:03:47.032
but I'm gonna go deeper
86

86

00:03:47.032  -->  00:03:49.489
into why I did it this way a bit later.
87

87

00:03:49.489  -->  00:03:51.882
What matters for now is that we're gonna start
88

88

00:03:51.882  -->  00:03:53.596
with the base CSS file,
89

89

00:03:53.596  -->  00:03:55.178
where this time I also already have
90

90

00:03:55.178  -->  00:03:56.653
the color variables here
91

91

00:03:56.653  -->  00:03:59.570
and also some font variables, okay.
92

92

00:04:00.431  -->  00:04:02.811
Then, of course, also the index file
93

93

00:04:02.811  -->  00:04:05.911
where we have the Google fonts already included.
94

94

00:04:05.911  -->  00:04:08.202
This time it's called Josef and Sans
95

95

00:04:08.202  -->  00:04:11.433
and something called Nunito or something.
96

96

00:04:11.433  -->  00:04:13.987
Then, of course, the styles are already included,
97

97

00:04:13.987  -->  00:04:16.463
the favicon, the title is already here
98

98

00:04:16.463  -->  00:04:19.167
and then the empty body element, okay.
99

99

00:04:19.167  -->  00:04:21.475
And finally, also, the package json file
100

100

00:04:21.475  -->  00:04:25.089
and this is, again, very similar to the last Trilo project.
101

101

00:04:25.089  -->  00:04:27.933
So we have our watch CSS and devserver script here
102

102

00:04:27.933  -->  00:04:30.151
to basically start our development workflow,
103

103

00:04:30.151  -->  00:04:33.007
where at the same time we watch for SASS changes
104

104

00:04:33.007  -->  00:04:34.760
and we have our devserver.
105

105

00:04:34.760  -->  00:04:36.861
Then down here is this our build process
106

106

00:04:36.861  -->  00:04:40.216
and I'm gonna talk about that a bit later, all right.
107

107

00:04:40.216  -->  00:04:41.690
So up here we say Nexter
108

108

00:04:41.690  -->  00:04:43.630
and Nexter webpage as the description
109

109

00:04:43.630  -->  00:04:46.919
and so everything is ready to work here.
110

110

00:04:46.919  -->  00:04:49.218
Now let's actually install these dev dependencies
111

111

00:04:49.218  -->  00:04:50.607
that we have here because you see,
112

112

00:04:50.607  -->  00:04:54.006
we have no node modules folder here, on the left side.
113

113

00:04:54.006  -->  00:04:55.515
So we have to open up our terminal
114

114

00:04:55.515  -->  00:04:57.814
and do NPM install here.
115

115

00:04:57.814  -->  00:05:00.981
So let me increase this a bit for you.
116

116

00:05:02.457  -->  00:05:04.957
So cd desktop and three Nexter
117

117

00:05:06.730  -->  00:05:08.111
and you can of course navigate
118

118

00:05:08.111  -->  00:05:12.179
to wherever your project file is located on your file system
119

119

00:05:12.179  -->  00:05:14.357
and now I'm going to run NPM install
120

120

00:05:14.357  -->  00:05:16.168
and remember that what this does
121

121

00:05:16.168  -->  00:05:19.456
is that basically it looks at our packaged dot json file
122

122

00:05:19.456  -->  00:05:22.252
and then installs all of these dev dependencies
123

123

00:05:22.252  -->  00:05:25.201
that we have listed here in this file
124

124

00:05:25.201  -->  00:05:27.639
and now you'll see that the folders are already here
125

125

00:05:27.639  -->  00:05:29.391
and so let's now, very quickly, just to test
126

126

00:05:29.391  -->  00:05:32.627
if everything works, let's start by creating
127

127

00:05:32.627  -->  00:05:36.955
our global settings here in this base dot SCSS file, okay.
128

128

00:05:36.955  -->  00:05:39.960
So we start very quickly with our global reset,
129

129

00:05:39.960  -->  00:05:41.585
so we see everything,
130

130

00:05:41.585  -->  00:05:45.418
including the sudo elements, before and after,
131

131

00:05:48.598  -->  00:05:52.098
and as always, we set their margin to zero
132

132

00:05:53.288  -->  00:05:54.808
and their padding to zero
133

133

00:05:54.808  -->  00:05:57.641
and we also say box sizing inherit
134

134

00:06:00.370  -->  00:06:04.370
and we're then gonna inherit that from the HTML.
135

135

00:06:05.983  -->  00:06:10.099
Okay, and so this is where we have box sizing
136

136

00:06:10.099  -->  00:06:12.175
set to border box and I already explained to you
137

137

00:06:12.175  -->  00:06:15.347
why we did it this way in the last project, right.
138

138

00:06:15.347  -->  00:06:17.531
Now another thing that we do here in the HTML, always,
139

139

00:06:17.531  -->  00:06:20.114
is to set our overall font size
140

140

00:06:21.129  -->  00:06:23.729
and so we're gonna go with the same technique
141

141

00:06:23.729  -->  00:06:25.482
that I showed you before.
142

142

00:06:25.482  -->  00:06:28.500
So we're gonna set it to 62.5 percent
143

143

00:06:28.500  -->  00:06:32.993
and that's so that one rem equals exactly ten pixels, okay.
144

144

00:06:32.993  -->  00:06:36.808
So let me actually write it down here for you, once again.
145

145

00:06:36.808  -->  00:06:39.205
So 10 pixels divided by 16 pixels,
146

146

00:06:39.205  -->  00:06:41.596
which is the browser default,
147

147

00:06:41.596  -->  00:06:44.596
makes 62.5 percent, and so this way,
148

148

00:06:45.899  -->  00:06:48.482
one rem equals 10 pixels, okay.
149

149

00:06:49.806  -->  00:06:53.973
And now, just global font settings on the body element
150

150

00:06:56.538  -->  00:06:58.310
and so we set the font family
151

151

00:06:58.310  -->  00:07:00.323
and actually I already have a variable here
152

152

00:07:00.323  -->  00:07:02.656
so we set it to font primary
153

153

00:07:04.025  -->  00:07:08.192
and the primary font is then this Nunito font here, okay.
154

154

00:07:10.558  -->  00:07:13.058
Then the color that I chose should be this color,
155

155

00:07:13.058  -->  00:07:17.295
gray dark here, so color gray dark, so it's this one here.
156

156

00:07:17.295  -->  00:07:19.359
So again we have our primary color of course
157

157

00:07:19.359  -->  00:07:21.600
which is this gold color.
158

158

00:07:21.600  -->  00:07:23.840
So I chose gold color for this brand
159

159

00:07:23.840  -->  00:07:25.117
because it's luxury homes,
160

160

00:07:25.117  -->  00:07:26.643
as I was telling you in the beginning,
161

161

00:07:26.643  -->  00:07:28.697
and so, therefore, gold seemed to be a good
162

162

00:07:28.697  -->  00:07:30.470
color choice for that, okay.
163

163

00:07:30.470  -->  00:07:33.898
Then the secondary color is like this very dark blue,
164

164

00:07:33.898  -->  00:07:35.813
which plays very well with gold,
165

165

00:07:35.813  -->  00:07:37.160
and so that's why I chose that.
166

166

00:07:37.160  -->  00:07:38.367
And then we have, of course,
167

167

00:07:38.367  -->  00:07:39.505
the lighter grays, as always,
168

168

00:07:39.505  -->  00:07:41.328
and the dark grays and they're like a bit,
169

169

00:07:41.328  -->  00:07:43.801
also like brown and that's because
170

170

00:07:43.801  -->  00:07:46.329
that compliments the gray primary color
171

171

00:07:46.329  -->  00:07:48.769
in a bit better than if we would just have used
172

172

00:07:48.769  -->  00:07:50.769
a pure black-based gray.
173

173

00:07:51.625  -->  00:07:53.658
So you see here on the color thing here
174

174

00:07:53.658  -->  00:07:56.280
that this is close to the gray sides
175

175

00:07:56.280  -->  00:08:00.716
but also in a bit in the golden part of the color spectrum.
176

176

00:08:00.716  -->  00:08:03.299
So let's then actually use that
177

177

00:08:06.648  -->  00:08:08.815
color gray dark too, okay.
178

178

00:08:10.849  -->  00:08:13.544
The font weight that we want is 300
179

179

00:08:13.544  -->  00:08:16.842
and I can use 300 because that's what I included
180

180

00:08:16.842  -->  00:08:18.794
here from the Google font, okay.
181

181

00:08:18.794  -->  00:08:21.614
So I have Nunito and I have font weights
182

182

00:08:21.614  -->  00:08:24.493
of 300 and 300 in italics
183

183

00:08:24.493  -->  00:08:26.826
and the same here for the Josefin Sans
184

184

00:08:26.826  -->  00:08:29.345
which will be more for titles, okay.
185

185

00:08:29.345  -->  00:08:32.259
So I chose the Nunito font as the overall font family
186

186

00:08:32.259  -->  00:08:34.023
because it's a bit more neutral
187

187

00:08:34.023  -->  00:08:36.763
and then this Josefin Sans we have in weights
188

188

00:08:36.763  -->  00:08:39.248
300, 400, and 400 italic,
189

189

00:08:39.248  -->  00:08:41.024
and this one will be for the titles.
190

190

00:08:41.024  -->  00:08:44.322
So this time we have two fonts, okay.
191

191

00:08:44.322  -->  00:08:46.492
So font weight of 300
192

192

00:08:46.492  -->  00:08:48.398
and so it's kind of a thinner font
193

193

00:08:48.398  -->  00:08:50.590
and that gives it once again a bit more
194

194

00:08:50.590  -->  00:08:52.646
a luxury feel to the entire page
195

195

00:08:52.646  -->  00:08:55.350
and that's what we're looking for in design like this.
196

196

00:08:55.350  -->  00:08:58.799
Finally, the line height should be 1.6.
197

197

00:08:58.799  -->  00:09:02.382
And now let's just add some dummy text here
198

198

00:09:03.848  -->  00:09:06.067
just so that we can test if our development workflow
199

199

00:09:06.067  -->  00:09:07.855
is actually working properly.
200

200

00:09:07.855  -->  00:09:10.211
So let's check out the terminal actually here
201

201

00:09:10.211  -->  00:09:13.174
and yeah, it looks like everything worked just fine
202

202

00:09:13.174  -->  00:09:15.448
and so now we can do NPM run start,
203

203

00:09:15.448  -->  00:09:16.749
but before we do that actually let's
204

204

00:09:16.749  -->  00:09:18.779
come back to the package dot json file
205

205

00:09:18.779  -->  00:09:21.996
and we can do one small change here in the live server
206

206

00:09:21.996  -->  00:09:24.259
and that is to set the browser
207

207

00:09:24.259  -->  00:09:26.312
because if we just run it like this
208

208

00:09:26.312  -->  00:09:28.949
then it will basically launch our default browser
209

209

00:09:28.949  -->  00:09:31.481
for the devserver and so it will launch Google Chrome
210

210

00:09:31.481  -->  00:09:33.872
but remember that because of the CSS grid dev tools
211

211

00:09:33.872  -->  00:09:35.567
that we want to make use of,
212

212

00:09:35.567  -->  00:09:37.913
we have been using Firefox in this part of the course
213

213

00:09:37.913  -->  00:09:40.365
and so we're gonna do that in this project as well
214

214

00:09:40.365  -->  00:09:42.383
and so what we can do here is to specify
215

215

00:09:42.383  -->  00:09:46.666
the browser option, so we write browser and then Firefox
216

216

00:09:46.666  -->  00:09:49.360
and so it will automatically open up in Firefox
217

217

00:09:49.360  -->  00:09:51.943
instead of Google Chrome, okay.
218

218

00:09:53.087  -->  00:09:57.254
So NPM run start, and actually for the start script,
219

219

00:09:58.892  -->  00:10:01.618
I'm not sure if I have told you this in another lecture,
220

220

00:10:01.618  -->  00:10:02.711
but for the start command,
221

221

00:10:02.711  -->  00:10:05.356
we actually don't even need to type run, okay.
222

222

00:10:05.356  -->  00:10:09.023
So for start, we just need to type NPM start
223

223

00:10:10.850  -->  00:10:14.353
and now let's see and yeah, here we go.
224

224

00:10:14.353  -->  00:10:18.034
So, test text, however it doesn't really look like
225

225

00:10:18.034  -->  00:10:20.750
our SASS style is already applying here
226

226

00:10:20.750  -->  00:10:22.680
and I'm sure that's because we still
227

227

00:10:22.680  -->  00:10:24.373
have to save the file.
228

228

00:10:24.373  -->  00:10:27.125
So remember that here this SASS script
229

229

00:10:27.125  -->  00:10:31.103
that we're running here, so this one here,
230

230

00:10:31.103  -->  00:10:33.507
the watch SASS task, which is the one that we're running,
231

231

00:10:33.507  -->  00:10:36.281
is waiting for changes and so it's only gonna compile
232

232

00:10:36.281  -->  00:10:39.324
the SASS file when we save it, okay.
233

233

00:10:39.324  -->  00:10:41.695
So let's give this one a save.
234

234

00:10:41.695  -->  00:10:42.736
I didn't even change anything,
235

235

00:10:42.736  -->  00:10:44.136
but I just saved it, okay.
236

236

00:10:44.136  -->  00:10:46.385
And so let's check it out here
237

237

00:10:46.385  -->  00:10:47.866
and yeah, it's changed something
238

238

00:10:47.866  -->  00:10:52.413
and so let's go to Firefox and so now you'll see it changed.
239

239

00:10:52.413  -->  00:10:56.724
Let's actually get it back to 100 percent here,
240

240

00:10:56.724  -->  00:11:00.203
and so now you see here that this is the lighter gray text
241

241

00:11:00.203  -->  00:11:02.885
and already with the font family that I specified
242

242

00:11:02.885  -->  00:11:06.217
and so just as before, we have the final version here
243

243

00:11:06.217  -->  00:11:08.276
on this site so that we can take a look
244

244

00:11:08.276  -->  00:11:10.676
at what we wanted to build and then here,
245

245

00:11:10.676  -->  00:11:12.486
of course, our development version.
246

246

00:11:12.486  -->  00:11:14.042
And so right now we're ready to start
247

247

00:11:14.042  -->  00:11:17.238
with a project and so that's what we're gonna do
248

248

00:11:17.238  -->  00:11:19.329
in the next lecture, where we're gonna start
249

249

00:11:19.329  -->  00:11:22.318
building the over-layout of this page.
250

250

00:11:22.318  -->  00:11:23.997
So I hope you are excited for that
251

251

00:11:23.997  -->  00:11:27.164
and so come join me in the next video.
