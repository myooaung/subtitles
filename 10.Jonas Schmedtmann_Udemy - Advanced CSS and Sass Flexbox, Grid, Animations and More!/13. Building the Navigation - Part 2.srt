00:00:01,241  -->  00:00:03,643
<v ->[Narrator} Now it's time to style the navigation itself,</v>
2

2

00:00:03,643  -->  00:00:06,012
and to build that cool hover effect
3

3

00:00:06,012  -->  00:00:08,841
that I showed you before.
4

4

00:00:08,841  -->  00:00:12,177
Now first of all, let's actually style the text here
5

5

00:00:12,177  -->  00:00:16,890
and the icon, so we can then apply this hover effect, okay?
6

6

00:00:16,890  -->  00:00:21,057
So, starting with that, coming over to our components here.
7

7

00:00:22,759  -->  00:00:24,585
The first thing that I actually want to do
8

8

00:00:24,585  -->  00:00:28,752
is to set the font size here on the side navigation.
9

9

00:00:30,182  -->  00:00:32,932
So, font size one point four rem.
10

10

00:00:33,842  -->  00:00:36,571
Then I want to get rid of the list style, of course,
11

11

00:00:36,571  -->  00:00:39,671
such as always, and then also give it
12

12

00:00:39,671  -->  00:00:43,838
a nice margin to the top, of three point five rem.
13

13

00:00:45,652  -->  00:00:47,835
All right, and now the link,
14

14

00:00:47,835  -->  00:00:52,332
we, of course, need to apply the link pseudo class here.
15

15

00:00:52,332  -->  00:00:56,249
So link, and then of course, also, the visited.
16

16

00:01:00,867  -->  00:01:03,200
So, first of all, the color,
17

17

00:01:06,741  -->  00:01:09,316
and this one shouldn't really be white,
18

18

00:01:09,316  -->  00:01:12,816
so I want it to be this really light gray.
19

19

00:01:15,598  -->  00:01:17,873
Okay, that looks better than pure white,
20

20

00:01:17,873  -->  00:01:19,700
on such a dark background.
21

21

00:01:19,700  -->  00:01:23,196
Next, let's get rid of the underline,
22

22

00:01:23,196  -->  00:01:25,196
so text decoration none.
23

23

00:01:28,419  -->  00:01:31,336
Then a text transform to uppercase,
24

24

00:01:32,223  -->  00:01:35,532
and we should also display them as block or an inline block.
25

25

00:01:35,532  -->  00:01:37,368
It doesn't really matter, it's really the same.
26

26

00:01:37,368  -->  00:01:39,491
So let's just say a block.
27

27

00:01:39,491  -->  00:01:42,696
Okay, then we want some padding on them.
28

28

00:01:42,696  -->  00:01:46,863
So one point five rem at the top, and three left and right.
29

29

00:01:48,024  -->  00:01:51,383
Okay, so let's take a look at that.
30

30

00:01:51,383  -->  00:01:53,413
And that is already much better.
31

31

00:01:53,413  -->  00:01:55,827
So now all have to do is to style these icons here
32

32

00:01:55,827  -->  00:01:57,441
and give them the same white color
33

33

00:01:57,441  -->  00:02:00,691
and some margin here on the right side.
34

34

00:02:03,155  -->  00:02:07,238
So margin right, two rem and then the fill, okay?
35

35

00:02:10,014  -->  00:02:13,103
Now we want them to be the same color as the link,
36

36

00:02:13,103  -->  00:02:14,311
and so I can now go ahead and
37

37

00:02:14,311  -->  00:02:17,784
just copy this color variable and paste it here.
38

38

00:02:17,784  -->  00:02:19,500
But we actually can do better
39

39

00:02:19,500  -->  00:02:23,018
by using something called current color.
40

40

00:02:23,018  -->  00:02:26,570
Okay, and current color basically is just the color
41

41

00:02:26,570  -->  00:02:29,473
of the current element or the parent element.
42

42

00:02:29,473  -->  00:02:31,685
Okay, and so that is really useful.
43

43

00:02:31,685  -->  00:02:34,416
Current color is really awesome, and I will actually
44

44

00:02:34,416  -->  00:02:37,503
show you another example of that a bit later.
45

45

00:02:37,503  -->  00:02:41,172
And also it's really well supported by many browsers.
46

46

00:02:41,172  -->  00:02:43,703
So I don't know why more people doesn't use it,
47

47

00:02:43,703  -->  00:02:45,607
because it really can be used all over the place,
48

48

00:02:45,607  -->  00:02:48,485
not just with fill here, but again I'm gonna
49

49

00:02:48,485  -->  00:02:50,890
show you another example a bit later.
50

50

00:02:50,890  -->  00:02:53,339
Okay, so this current color simply means
51

51

00:02:53,339  -->  00:02:56,520
the color of this element here, or the parent.
52

52

00:02:56,520  -->  00:02:59,887
So let me show that to you, and yeah,
53

53

00:02:59,887  -->  00:03:01,664
so now it's white actually.
54

54

00:03:01,664  -->  00:03:05,831
Okay, and if I were to change now the color on this one here
55

55

00:03:06,779  -->  00:03:10,356
like to blue, then it will become blue because
56

56

00:03:10,356  -->  00:03:13,577
that's not the current color of this element.
57

57

00:03:13,577  -->  00:03:16,244
So, you see that, now it's blue.
58

58

00:03:17,467  -->  00:03:20,584
Okay, and another awesome application is, for example,
59

59

00:03:20,584  -->  00:03:24,751
imagine that we had a hover effect on this link here, okay.
60

60

00:03:28,272  -->  00:03:32,914
Just to show it to you very quickly, so hover.
61

61

00:03:32,914  -->  00:03:36,054
And on this hover we wanted to change the color
62

62

00:03:36,054  -->  00:03:39,137
of the link to orange red, of course.
63

63

00:03:40,435  -->  00:03:44,541
So what would happen then with the icon?
64

64

00:03:44,541  -->  00:03:47,175
Well, it will become orange as well.
65

65

00:03:47,175  -->  00:03:49,676
So that is really, really useful, okay.
66

66

00:03:49,676  -->  00:03:51,972
So, without current color, we then would have
67

67

00:03:51,972  -->  00:03:56,141
to write some code to make the icon here orange as well,
68

68

00:03:56,141  -->  00:03:57,274
and that would be a lot of work.
69

69

00:03:57,274  -->  00:03:59,960
So with current color we can avoid all of that
70

70

00:03:59,960  -->  00:04:03,142
because it will simply like inherit the color.
71

71

00:04:03,142  -->  00:04:04,909
So a really useful feature, I just wanted
72

72

00:04:04,909  -->  00:04:07,240
to show it to you here.
73

73

00:04:07,240  -->  00:04:09,219
Now if you watch closely here, you see that
74

74

00:04:09,219  -->  00:04:11,414
these are actually not well aligned.
75

75

00:04:11,414  -->  00:04:14,228
So this one here, starts a little bit before the tours,
76

76

00:04:14,228  -->  00:04:17,468
so it's not well aligned, it's not vertically centered.
77

77

00:04:17,468  -->  00:04:20,509
So, of course, we can use flex box for that.
78

78

00:04:20,509  -->  00:04:22,596
And what is the flex box container here?
79

79

00:04:22,596  -->  00:04:25,502
Well, let's just take a look at our markup,
80

80

00:04:25,502  -->  00:04:27,534
and so here is the icon.
81

81

00:04:27,534  -->  00:04:29,597
So this svg and here is the text.
82

82

00:04:29,597  -->  00:04:32,327
So these two elements should be vertically aligned
83

83

00:04:32,327  -->  00:04:36,996
and therefore our flex container is side nav link.
84

84

00:04:36,996  -->  00:04:39,556
Okay, so this one here.
85

85

00:04:39,556  -->  00:04:42,556
So, this is very easy, display flex,
86

86

00:04:43,666  -->  00:04:48,208
and then align items, right, and set it to center.
87

87

00:04:48,208  -->  00:04:50,359
And that's it, with just two lines of code,
88

88

00:04:50,359  -->  00:04:54,117
you can automatically center these elements vertically.
89

89

00:04:54,117  -->  00:04:56,117
And yep, so, here we go.
90

90

00:04:56,952  -->  00:04:58,487
So this already looks pretty similar
91

91

00:04:58,487  -->  00:05:00,785
to this version here, right?
92

92

00:05:00,785  -->  00:05:04,105
All we have to do now is this effect.
93

93

00:05:04,105  -->  00:05:05,812
And how do we do that?
94

94

00:05:05,812  -->  00:05:08,284
Well, we're going to use a before pseudo element,
95

95

00:05:08,284  -->  00:05:12,013
which we basically place before this list item here
96

96

00:05:12,013  -->  00:05:14,298
and that is the one that will show
97

97

00:05:14,298  -->  00:05:16,101
as soon as we hover this item.
98

98

00:05:16,101  -->  00:05:19,720
Okay, so it will show and then grow to the right side.
99

99

00:05:19,720  -->  00:05:21,700
So, let's implement that.
100

100

00:05:21,700  -->  00:05:24,180
So, before the side nav item, we want
101

101

00:05:24,180  -->  00:05:26,180
to add a pseudo element.
102

102

00:05:28,760  -->  00:05:30,177
So, item, before.
103

103

00:05:33,530  -->  00:05:35,605
Okay, and that will be that small line
104

104

00:05:35,605  -->  00:05:39,167
that becomes visible and then expands to the right side.
105

105

00:05:39,167  -->  00:05:42,489
So, first off, as always, we have to specify the content,
106

106

00:05:42,489  -->  00:05:45,395
otherwise it's not even going to show in a browser, okay?
107

107

00:05:45,395  -->  00:05:48,074
So, the content is that too is set to nothing.
108

108

00:05:48,074  -->  00:05:52,241
Now in order to position this, let's use absolute position,
109

109

00:05:53,251  -->  00:05:57,334
and set it right to the top, zero and left, zero.
110

110

00:06:00,247  -->  00:06:03,712
Okay, and also give it a height of 100%, so that
111

111

00:06:03,712  -->  00:06:08,054
it has exactly the same height as the list item, okay?
112

112

00:06:08,054  -->  00:06:12,837
Then we want to give it a whiff of just three pixels,
113

113

00:06:12,837  -->  00:06:15,670
and of course, a background color.
114

114

00:06:16,576  -->  00:06:20,576
Which is our primary color, so our primary pink.
115

115

00:06:22,610  -->  00:06:24,943
All right, now before we can check this out,
116

116

00:06:24,943  -->  00:06:27,526
we actually have to set the parent element,
117

117

00:06:27,526  -->  00:06:31,016
which is the item here to position to position relative.
118

118

00:06:31,016  -->  00:06:33,547
Okay, so that the before pseudo element
119

119

00:06:33,547  -->  00:06:37,032
is then positioned in relation to that one.
120

120

00:06:37,032  -->  00:06:39,700
All right, so let's just check that out.
121

121

00:06:39,700  -->  00:06:42,440
And actually, it's not here, why is that?
122

122

00:06:42,440  -->  00:06:45,273
Let me see, here in the inspector.
123

123

00:06:46,657  -->  00:06:50,824
So, the before, ah, what did I do here, position zero?
124

124

00:06:53,472  -->  00:06:54,787
What's that?
125

125

00:06:54,787  -->  00:06:56,624
Of course it's positioned absolute
126

126

00:06:56,624  -->  00:06:59,910
and you probably saw this one coming, okay?
127

127

00:06:59,910  -->  00:07:02,880
And okay, so now, here it is.
128

128

00:07:02,880  -->  00:07:04,829
Now what we need here before can continue
129

129

00:07:04,829  -->  00:07:07,952
is some space between all of these items, right?
130

130

00:07:07,952  -->  00:07:12,119
So item, and we're gonna use, again, or not pseudo class.
131

131

00:07:14,557  -->  00:07:17,974
Okay, so, just like this, not last child.
132

132

00:07:25,006  -->  00:07:27,898
Okay, so then we can add the margin bottom
133

133

00:07:27,898  -->  00:07:31,229
on all the items except the last one.
134

134

00:07:31,229  -->  00:07:33,017
So that's pretty standard by now,
135

135

00:07:33,017  -->  00:07:34,573
we've been using it all the time.
136

136

00:07:34,573  -->  00:07:38,139
So, take a look again, and yeah here we go.
137

137

00:07:38,139  -->  00:07:40,552
Now this will, of course, not be visible all the time
138

138

00:07:40,552  -->  00:07:43,677
but only when we hover the item, right?
139

139

00:07:43,677  -->  00:07:45,510
And so, let's do that.
140

140

00:07:46,696  -->  00:07:47,863
So, down here.
141

141

00:07:52,515  -->  00:07:54,765
Item hover and then before.
142

142

00:07:59,721  -->  00:08:02,158
Okay, and so what we're gonna do here is
143

143

00:08:02,158  -->  00:08:04,991
to say transform, scale Y, to one.
144

144

00:08:06,419  -->  00:08:08,624
Now I'm gonna explain you how this works in a second,
145

145

00:08:08,624  -->  00:08:12,693
but before that, we have to actually change it to zero,
146

146

00:08:12,693  -->  00:08:14,947
here and the normal state, right?
147

147

00:08:14,947  -->  00:08:17,278
So this is the normal state without any hover,
148

148

00:08:17,278  -->  00:08:19,764
and so we say scale Y, zero.
149

149

00:08:19,764  -->  00:08:22,828
And when we then hover the item, the before pseudo element
150

150

00:08:22,828  -->  00:08:27,471
will get to transform Y back to one, so, 100%.
151

151

00:08:27,471  -->  00:08:29,185
So what is scale Y?
152

152

00:08:29,185  -->  00:08:31,811
So usually when we use scale, the element scales
153

153

00:08:31,811  -->  00:08:34,759
in all of the directions so X and Y,
154

154

00:08:34,759  -->  00:08:37,153
but if we do scale Y, well, then the scale
155

155

00:08:37,153  -->  00:08:41,142
only occurs in the Y direction, so, from top to bottom.
156

156

00:08:41,142  -->  00:08:44,116
So let me show you how that looks like.
157

157

00:08:44,116  -->  00:08:45,833
And actually for you to see it, I need
158

158

00:08:45,833  -->  00:08:47,725
to specify the transition as well.
159

159

00:08:47,725  -->  00:08:51,892
So, transition, transform, and this time I'm not going
160

160

00:08:52,770  -->  00:08:54,976
to put all here because later I want
161

161

00:08:54,976  -->  00:08:56,869
to add some stuff here, okay?
162

162

00:08:56,869  -->  00:08:58,226
And just so that you can see it, I'm gonna
163

163

00:08:58,226  -->  00:09:01,177
make it like really slow, so one second.
164

164

00:09:01,177  -->  00:09:03,834
So that you can see what happens here.
165

165

00:09:03,834  -->  00:09:06,909
So you saw that, let me show it to you again.
166

166

00:09:06,909  -->  00:09:09,825
So basically it starts in the middle and then it grows
167

167

00:09:09,825  -->  00:09:12,867
to the sides, and so it grows in the Y direction
168

168

00:09:12,867  -->  00:09:15,700
because we're using scale Y, okay?
169

169

00:09:16,977  -->  00:09:18,799
And it starts in the center because
170

170

00:09:18,799  -->  00:09:22,200
that's where he transform origin is set, okay.
171

171

00:09:22,200  -->  00:09:25,778
Remember, I showed you the transform origin property before,
172

172

00:09:25,778  -->  00:09:29,007
well let me show it to you again, actually.
173

173

00:09:29,007  -->  00:09:31,639
So remember the transform origin, we used it,
174

174

00:09:31,639  -->  00:09:34,401
I think, on the navigation in the natures project.
175

175

00:09:34,401  -->  00:09:37,025
And I told you that it's usually set to center,
176

176

00:09:37,025  -->  00:09:40,149
but if we set it, for example, to bottom,
177

177

00:09:40,149  -->  00:09:42,494
then this is what's going to happen.
178

178

00:09:42,494  -->  00:09:45,268
It will start scaling at the bottom.
179

179

00:09:45,268  -->  00:09:47,185
And the same thing here, and the same thing here,
180

180

00:09:47,185  -->  00:09:48,543
and the same thing here.
181

181

00:09:48,543  -->  00:09:50,495
And if I set it to top, then, of course,
182

182

00:09:50,495  -->  00:09:52,003
it will start at the top.
183

183

00:09:52,003  -->  00:09:53,956
But the default is center, and that's why
184

184

00:09:53,956  -->  00:09:56,461
it starts scaling at the center.
185

185

00:09:56,461  -->  00:09:59,375
Alright, and so that's allows for that cool affect,
186

186

00:09:59,375  -->  00:10:00,969
where it basically starts growing
187

187

00:10:00,969  -->  00:10:02,888
in the middle to both the sides.
188

188

00:10:02,888  -->  00:10:06,596
Okay, so that part of the animation is already working now,
189

189

00:10:06,596  -->  00:10:08,096
so this part here.
190

190

00:10:09,046  -->  00:10:11,078
Now what we also want is that,
191

191

00:10:11,078  -->  00:10:14,554
after that, it expands the width, all right?
192

192

00:10:14,554  -->  00:10:18,370
And so that's not hard to do as well.
193

193

00:10:18,370  -->  00:10:21,079
So, in here, we need to say that we want
194

194

00:10:21,079  -->  00:10:25,731
the width of this to be 100%, and that's it.
195

195

00:10:25,731  -->  00:10:27,806
So, initially it's three pixels,
196

196

00:10:27,806  -->  00:10:30,647
and then it expands to 100%.
197

197

00:10:30,647  -->  00:10:32,417
Now in order to actually see this, we need
198

198

00:10:32,417  -->  00:10:34,793
to add a delay to that width, right?
199

199

00:10:34,793  -->  00:10:39,705
'Cause if we don't, it will simply look like this.
200

200

00:10:39,705  -->  00:10:41,785
So it will expand immediately and then
201

201

00:10:41,785  -->  00:10:44,490
you'll see it's scaling, but that's not what we want.
202

202

00:10:44,490  -->  00:10:47,102
And so, there's an ability in the transition property
203

203

00:10:47,102  -->  00:10:50,376
to add different settings for different properties.
204

204

00:10:50,376  -->  00:10:54,293
So, for transform, let's put point two seconds.
205

205

00:10:57,498  -->  00:11:01,963
And then, for the width, we can say we want it to happen
206

206

00:11:01,963  -->  00:11:05,796
in point four seconds, for example, and with a delay.
207

207

00:11:05,796  -->  00:11:06,795
Remember that one?
208

208

00:11:06,795  -->  00:11:08,931
So we can set delays in transitions
209

209

00:11:08,931  -->  00:11:10,429
and in animations in general.
210

210

00:11:10,429  -->  00:11:12,844
And so we want a delay of point two seconds,
211

211

00:11:12,844  -->  00:11:14,691
which is exactly the time it takes
212

212

00:11:14,691  -->  00:11:16,780
for this first transform here to happen.
213

213

00:11:16,780  -->  00:11:19,226
So, first the transform happens during these
214

214

00:11:19,226  -->  00:11:22,364
two point seconds, and we wait this time
215

215

00:11:22,364  -->  00:11:24,641
until we start transitioning the width.
216

216

00:11:24,641  -->  00:11:27,393
And that's then going to take point four seconds,
217

217

00:11:27,393  -->  00:11:29,643
so let me show that to you.
218

218

00:11:31,200  -->  00:11:32,533
And, here we go.
219

219

00:11:33,777  -->  00:11:35,491
So that's already pretty similar to what
220

220

00:11:35,491  -->  00:11:38,138
we have in the original demo, right?
221

221

00:11:38,138  -->  00:11:39,694
But the original demo looks a bit better
222

222

00:11:39,694  -->  00:11:41,807
because it has different timing functions.
223

223

00:11:41,807  -->  00:11:44,057
You see, let's take a look.
224

224

00:11:45,081  -->  00:11:48,158
So it starts like really slow and accelerates,
225

225

00:11:48,158  -->  00:11:50,560
and that looks like really cool, okay.
226

226

00:11:50,560  -->  00:11:53,846
So let me show you that, and so I need to show you
227

227

00:11:53,846  -->  00:11:56,262
that site that I showed you before,
228

228

00:11:56,262  -->  00:11:58,802
which I don't remember right now.
229

229

00:11:58,802  -->  00:12:02,844
And the one that I want to show you is this one.
230

230

00:12:02,844  -->  00:12:06,257
So, where we accelerate real fast in the beginning,
231

231

00:12:06,257  -->  00:12:09,822
like this, and then at the end it slows down.
232

232

00:12:09,822  -->  00:12:11,436
So let's take a look at that example,
233

233

00:12:11,436  -->  00:12:14,103
so this one here, this pink one.
234

234

00:12:15,311  -->  00:12:17,239
So that's pretty similar to the one
235

235

00:12:17,239  -->  00:12:19,550
that I showed you in the demo, right?
236

236

00:12:19,550  -->  00:12:23,717
So, what we want is cubic bezier, let's copy that, okay.
237

237

00:12:24,961  -->  00:12:28,461
So, what we want here is the cubic bezier.
238

238

00:12:31,278  -->  00:12:33,681
And well what happened here?
239

239

00:12:33,681  -->  00:12:35,932
Anyway, I can just type it out.
240

240

00:12:35,932  -->  00:12:38,849
So one, zero, zero, one, all right?
241

241

00:12:41,645  -->  00:12:45,242
So that's the way we want it to happen.
242

242

00:12:45,242  -->  00:12:48,912
So, let's take a look at that, and yep.
243

243

00:12:48,912  -->  00:12:51,141
So now it's like the example
244

244

00:12:51,141  -->  00:12:53,323
in the website that I showed you.
245

245

00:12:53,323  -->  00:12:56,423
So basically it starts really slow, then it accelerates
246

246

00:12:56,423  -->  00:12:59,290
real fast, and then it slows down again.
247

247

00:12:59,290  -->  00:13:00,973
And so it looks like really snappy
248

248

00:13:00,973  -->  00:13:04,263
and really modern, I really this look, okay.
249

249

00:13:04,263  -->  00:13:06,622
Now one thing, of course, that we have to fix is that
250

250

00:13:06,622  -->  00:13:08,503
this item here should be on top of this
251

251

00:13:08,503  -->  00:13:10,590
before a pseudo element, right?
252

252

00:13:10,590  -->  00:13:12,810
So let's give it some Z and X,
253

253

00:13:12,810  -->  00:13:14,783
and actually where we want that Z and X
254

254

00:13:14,783  -->  00:13:16,536
should be here on the link, right?
255

255

00:13:16,536  -->  00:13:18,929
'Cause what we want is the link to be on top
256

256

00:13:18,929  -->  00:13:21,929
of the before pseudo element, right?
257

257

00:13:23,097  -->  00:13:27,264
So, Z and X like ten, just a number that's higher,
258

258

00:13:28,383  -->  00:13:30,638
and that's not really working.
259

259

00:13:30,638  -->  00:13:32,852
And that is probably because we don't have
260

260

00:13:32,852  -->  00:13:35,418
the position here specified, okay.
261

261

00:13:35,418  -->  00:13:37,621
So, position relative,
262

262

00:13:37,621  -->  00:13:39,630
because the Z and X only works
263

263

00:13:39,630  -->  00:13:42,630
if we have specified position, okay?
264

264

00:13:43,651  -->  00:13:46,378
And so here we go, so now it works perfectly.
265

265

00:13:46,378  -->  00:13:49,045
And we're actually almost done here, all we need to do now
266

266

00:13:49,045  -->  00:13:53,020
is to add one item that is already like selected.
267

267

00:13:53,020  -->  00:13:54,903
So, this one here, right?
268

268

00:13:54,903  -->  00:13:57,169
And that's, of course, very, very easy,
269

269

00:13:57,169  -->  00:13:59,713
so all we have to do is to come to our html
270

270

00:13:59,713  -->  00:14:03,294
and, where is it, oh, here it is.
271

271

00:14:03,294  -->  00:14:07,308
So all we have to say is that this one should be active.
272

272

00:14:07,308  -->  00:14:10,808
So we add a modifier here, and say active.
273

273

00:14:11,685  -->  00:14:14,852
Now we come here and edit here, right.
274

274

00:14:16,739  -->  00:14:18,376
So the active state should be exactly
275

275

00:14:18,376  -->  00:14:21,656
the same as the hover state, right?
276

276

00:14:21,656  -->  00:14:24,489
So, item with the modifier active.
277

277

00:14:26,483  -->  00:14:30,650
And then, of course, before, so that should work now.
278

278

00:14:31,912  -->  00:14:35,186
And, in fact, here we go, okay?
279

279

00:14:35,186  -->  00:14:38,554
Now we just need like an active state,
280

280

00:14:38,554  -->  00:14:40,666
and what we do is simply like this.
281

281

00:14:40,666  -->  00:14:44,445
So when we click it, the color gets a little bit brighter.
282

282

00:14:44,445  -->  00:14:46,473
So it's not a huge difference, but at least
283

283

00:14:46,473  -->  00:14:49,502
we have some small active state to show the user
284

284

00:14:49,502  -->  00:14:52,380
that he clicked on the item, okay?
285

285

00:14:52,380  -->  00:14:55,630
And so that one is really easy as well,
286

286

00:14:58,627  -->  00:14:59,460
Item.
287

287

00:15:00,899  -->  00:15:05,066
Of course here it's underscore and now the active state
288

288

00:15:06,131  -->  00:15:09,048
and then the before pseudo element.
289

289

00:15:11,079  -->  00:15:13,155
And we simply say that the background color
290

290

00:15:13,155  -->  00:15:15,988
should be our light primary color.
291

291

00:15:17,416  -->  00:15:18,249
So color,
292

292

00:15:20,339  -->  00:15:22,149
primary, light.
293

293

00:15:22,149  -->  00:15:23,716
And this should also be animated,
294

294

00:15:23,716  -->  00:15:26,661
and so we can add another line to this one here,
295

295

00:15:26,661  -->  00:15:29,328
saying that the background color
296

296

00:15:31,072  -->  00:15:33,666
should be animated in like one point second.
297

297

00:15:33,666  -->  00:15:37,619
So really fast, just so there is any animation, okay?
298

298

00:15:37,619  -->  00:15:39,361
And remember this part here, okay.
299

299

00:15:39,361  -->  00:15:42,728
So we can set different settings for different properties,
300

300

00:15:42,728  -->  00:15:45,578
and that's really cool because this way we can have like
301

301

00:15:45,578  -->  00:15:49,149
the staged animations, where first the transform happens
302

302

00:15:49,149  -->  00:15:50,140
and then the width.
303

303

00:15:50,140  -->  00:15:52,578
Okay, so, with this delay that we have here.
304

304

00:15:52,578  -->  00:15:54,564
And, of course, we also have different durations
305

305

00:15:54,564  -->  00:15:57,013
for different properties, so the background color
306

306

00:15:57,013  -->  00:15:59,474
in point one then this one in point four and this one
307

307

00:15:59,474  -->  00:16:01,680
in point two seconds, and also
308

308

00:16:01,680  -->  00:16:04,396
different animation timing functions.
309

309

00:16:04,396  -->  00:16:07,148
Where this one is different than the default,
310

310

00:16:07,148  -->  00:16:09,261
which is happening on a transform and background color.
311

311

00:16:09,261  -->  00:16:11,102
So we didn't use this one before,
312

312

00:16:11,102  -->  00:16:14,348
but it's just another thing I wanted to show you here.
313

313

00:16:14,348  -->  00:16:16,590
All right, and with this, we are really
314

314

00:16:16,590  -->  00:16:18,735
done with this part here.
315

315

00:16:18,735  -->  00:16:22,868
So you see, we click and the color turns a bit brighter
316

316

00:16:22,868  -->  00:16:26,457
with this really fast animation in point one second,
317

317

00:16:26,457  -->  00:16:29,369
and yeah, that's actually it.
318

318

00:16:29,369  -->  00:16:32,840
So we have the sidebar now complete, and the header as well.
319

319

00:16:32,840  -->  00:16:35,797
So all there's left to do now is to actually fill
320

320

00:16:35,797  -->  00:16:38,443
this entire hotel view, all right?
321

321

00:16:38,443  -->  00:16:40,242
But for now, let's take a break
322

322

00:16:40,242  -->  00:16:42,646
and come back to this after that.
323

323

00:16:42,646  -->  00:16:45,729
So, once you're ready, let's move on.
