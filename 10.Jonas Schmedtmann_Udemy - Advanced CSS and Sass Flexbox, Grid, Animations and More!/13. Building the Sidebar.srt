00:00:01,241  -->  00:00:02,879
<v Instructor>Let's just take three minutes to</v>
2

2

00:00:02,879  -->  00:00:05,695
quickly finish the sidebar of our page.
3

3

00:00:05,695  -->  00:00:09,227
So once more you will just apply some of the concepts
4

4

00:00:09,227  -->  00:00:11,687
that you have learned before in the course.
5

5

00:00:11,687  -->  00:00:14,610
So all we're going to do is to add this small button here
6

6

00:00:14,610  -->  00:00:15,927
that we have in the sidebar
7

7

00:00:15,927  -->  00:00:17,320
and actually when we click it here
8

8

00:00:17,320  -->  00:00:18,880
then nothing really happens.
9

9

00:00:18,880  -->  00:00:20,768
So this is just a button so that something
10

10

00:00:20,768  -->  00:00:22,053
is in here, okay.
11

11

00:00:22,053  -->  00:00:24,818
So I just didn't want to leave this empty here
12

12

00:00:24,818  -->  00:00:28,597
and so I just packed this button in there, okay.
13

13

00:00:28,597  -->  00:00:32,685
So in our HTML right at the beginning,
14

14

00:00:32,685  -->  00:00:36,352
because that's where our sidebar element is,
15

15

00:00:37,491  -->  00:00:40,877
I'm just going to put a button here and call it
16

16

00:00:40,877  -->  00:00:43,996
the nav button.
17

17

00:00:43,996  -->  00:00:47,163
Okay, and no content in there and then
18

18

00:00:48,682  -->  00:00:51,099
here in the sidebar file
19

19

00:00:53,547  -->  00:00:55,518
let's quickly style this.
20

20

00:00:55,518  -->  00:00:57,879
So since it's a button we have to get rid
21

21

00:00:57,879  -->  00:01:00,196
of the border radius
22

22

00:01:00,196  -->  00:01:02,332
and of the border itself.
23

23

00:01:02,332  -->  00:01:04,329
So no border
24

24

00:01:04,329  -->  00:01:07,019
and no border radius.
25

25

00:01:07,019  -->  00:01:10,183
Okay, and so how are we going to do that?
26

26

00:01:10,183  -->  00:01:12,045
Well once again we're just going to create
27

27

00:01:12,045  -->  00:01:14,571
like a very small white rectangle here
28

28

00:01:14,571  -->  00:01:17,666
and then with a before and an after pseudo element
29

29

00:01:17,666  -->  00:01:20,206
we are going to create the other one.
30

30

00:01:20,206  -->  00:01:22,456
Okay, so
31

31

00:01:23,381  -->  00:01:25,599
this will have a white background color
32

32

00:01:25,599  -->  00:01:29,099
and it's only going to be two pixels high,
33

33

00:01:30,566  -->  00:01:32,983
so two pixels and a width
34

34

00:01:34,046  -->  00:01:37,372
of 45 pixels, so 4.5 rem.
35

35

00:01:37,372  -->  00:01:39,789
Okay, and then let's just add
36

36

00:01:41,026  -->  00:01:44,359
the before and the after pseudo element.
37

37

00:01:49,407  -->  00:01:53,016
So just like this nav button itself
38

38

00:01:53,016  -->  00:01:55,202
it will have the three properties
39

39

00:01:55,202  -->  00:01:57,770
and in order to make them actually visible
40

40

00:01:57,770  -->  00:02:00,949
we need to give them the content property.
41

41

00:02:00,949  -->  00:02:03,514
So content and set it to empty
42

42

00:02:03,514  -->  00:02:07,347
and I'm also going to display them as a block.
43

43

00:02:08,547  -->  00:02:10,618
Okay, and now finally we have to move
44

44

00:02:10,618  -->  00:02:13,229
one of them up and one down.
45

45

00:02:13,229  -->  00:02:17,229
So the before is the one we're going to move up.
46

46

00:02:20,429  -->  00:02:24,904
So transform translate in the Y direction
47

47

00:02:24,904  -->  00:02:27,987
minus 1.5 rem
48

48

00:02:34,734  -->  00:02:37,007
and the one after we're going to move it down,
49

49

00:02:37,007  -->  00:02:38,959
so plus 1.5 rem.
50

50

00:02:38,959  -->  00:02:41,376
So let's take a look at that.
51

51

00:02:42,782  -->  00:02:44,897
Well that looks kind of weird
52

52

00:02:44,897  -->  00:02:46,685
and not really as expected.
53

53

00:02:46,685  -->  00:02:50,435
So let's take a look at what's happening here
54

54

00:02:53,090  -->  00:02:56,104
with the sidebar and this button here.
55

55

00:02:56,104  -->  00:03:00,072
So there's not really any style here applying to it,
56

56

00:03:00,072  -->  00:03:01,260
and why is that?
57

57

00:03:01,260  -->  00:03:02,924
So let's see if we have some error
58

58

00:03:02,924  -->  00:03:05,651
maybe in the terminal here, and actually yeah.
59

59

00:03:05,651  -->  00:03:07,421
So there are some kind of error.
60

60

00:03:07,421  -->  00:03:12,275
So it's apparently here in this part of the code.
61

61

00:03:12,275  -->  00:03:15,591
So yeah, so it's because I have the semicolon
62

62

00:03:15,591  -->  00:03:18,518
inside of these parenthesis
63

63

00:03:18,518  -->  00:03:22,164
and that's not where they should be of course.
64

64

00:03:22,164  -->  00:03:24,685
Okay, so that's that,
65

65

00:03:24,685  -->  00:03:27,519
and I think we cannot see the one before,
66

66

00:03:27,519  -->  00:03:30,310
because it is actually now outside of the page.
67

67

00:03:30,310  -->  00:03:33,077
So we need to move all of this here down a little bit.
68

68

00:03:33,077  -->  00:03:35,486
So the entire button,
69

69

00:03:35,486  -->  00:03:38,031
so margin top
70

70

00:03:38,031  -->  00:03:40,568
like four rem
71

71

00:03:40,568  -->  00:03:41,923
and let's take a look at that now,
72

72

00:03:41,923  -->  00:03:43,578
and yeah that looks much better.
73

73

00:03:43,578  -->  00:03:46,541
Now all there's left to do is to really center
74

74

00:03:46,541  -->  00:03:48,958
this here inside of the container.
75

75

00:03:48,958  -->  00:03:52,013
For that a good way to do it is to use Flexbox.
76

76

00:03:52,013  -->  00:03:53,694
So remember that I said that
77

77

00:03:53,694  -->  00:03:57,192
Flexbox is great for these very, very small applications
78

78

00:03:57,192  -->  00:03:59,992
like aligning and centering small stuff.
79

79

00:03:59,992  -->  00:04:03,179
Okay, and so this is a perfect use case
80

80

00:04:03,179  -->  00:04:04,844
for using Flexbox.
81

81

00:04:04,844  -->  00:04:07,511
So here on the sidebar container
82

82

00:04:09,043  -->  00:04:12,280
display flex and then all we have to do
83

83

00:04:12,280  -->  00:04:15,033
is to say justify content center,
84

84

00:04:15,033  -->  00:04:17,484
because remember that justify content
85

85

00:04:17,484  -->  00:04:20,706
aligns all of the items along the main axis,
86

86

00:04:20,706  -->  00:04:23,444
and that's the one that we want, so horizontally,
87

87

00:04:23,444  -->  00:04:24,890
and we want to center it.
88

88

00:04:24,890  -->  00:04:27,277
So that is the result.
89

89

00:04:27,277  -->  00:04:29,525
Now just a small problem here, I see that here
90

90

00:04:29,525  -->  00:04:32,873
this distance here is slightly smaller than this one here
91

91

00:04:32,873  -->  00:04:34,816
and that's because we translated both
92

92

00:04:34,816  -->  00:04:36,891
1.5 rem,
93

93

00:04:36,891  -->  00:04:39,033
but the place where it starts counting
94

94

00:04:39,033  -->  00:04:42,491
this offset is not really centered here apparently.
95

95

00:04:42,491  -->  00:04:44,321
So we just have to move this one here
96

96

00:04:44,321  -->  00:04:47,122
so that the after one a bit up.
97

97

00:04:47,122  -->  00:04:49,580
So probably like two pixels.
98

98

00:04:49,580  -->  00:04:53,763
So instead of 1.5 let's give it 1.3
99

99

00:04:53,763  -->  00:04:55,316
and that fixes it, and okay
100

100

00:04:55,316  -->  00:04:58,748
so we're good to go, another component that is ready now.
101

101

00:04:58,748  -->  00:05:01,629
So all that's left to do is to really finish now this header
102

102

00:05:01,629  -->  00:05:03,796
and this realtors part.
