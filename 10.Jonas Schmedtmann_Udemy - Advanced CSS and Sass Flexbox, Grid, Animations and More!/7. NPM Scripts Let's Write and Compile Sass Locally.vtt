00:00:00.429  -->  00:00:03.108
<v Narrator>With SASS now finally installed</v>
2

2

00:00:03.108  -->  00:00:05.526
on your computer, let's put a piece of SASS
3

3

00:00:05.526  -->  00:00:09.693
in our CSS code and then compile it in a command line.
4

4

00:00:11.111  -->  00:00:12.743
Now, the first thing that I want to do here
5

5

00:00:12.743  -->  00:00:16.481
is to create a folder where we can put our SASS files.
6

6

00:00:16.481  -->  00:00:17.759
So I do it here in a command line,
7

7

00:00:17.759  -->  00:00:20.434
because as I was saying, I really like to use it,
8

8

00:00:20.434  -->  00:00:24.517
so "mkdir", make directory, and then just "sass".
9

9

00:00:25.942  -->  00:00:28.239
Alright, and now you see it's already here.
10

10

00:00:28.239  -->  00:00:29.922
Of course we could have done it here in our
11

11

00:00:29.922  -->  00:00:33.544
code editor as well, just like you're hitting "New Folder"
12

12

00:00:33.544  -->  00:00:35.947
but again, I like to use the terminal
13

13

00:00:35.947  -->  00:00:37.418
for this kind of stuff.
14

14

00:00:37.418  -->  00:00:40.287
Then we can move in there
15

15

00:00:40.287  -->  00:00:43.784
and create our very first SASS file.
16

16

00:00:43.784  -->  00:00:46.495
And we do it by using the "touch" command
17

17

00:00:46.495  -->  00:00:48.296
and "edit" on Windows.
18

18

00:00:48.296  -->  00:00:49.954
And if "edit" doesn't work for that,
19

19

00:00:49.954  -->  00:00:53.370
then you can, of course, just do it in your code editor.
20

20

00:00:53.370  -->  00:00:57.370
So, "touch" and let's call it "main" and "scss."
21

21

00:00:58.488  -->  00:01:02.453
Okay, so remember there are two syntaxes of SASS.
22

22

00:01:02.453  -->  00:01:04.154
The first is called "SASS"
23

23

00:01:04.154  -->  00:01:06.222
and the second one is "SCSS."
24

24

00:01:06.222  -->  00:01:08.268
And if we want to write "SCSS,"
25

25

00:01:08.268  -->  00:01:10.604
which stands for "Sassy CSS",
26

26

00:01:10.604  -->  00:01:12.919
we have to specify the file extension
27

27

00:01:12.919  -->  00:01:14.752
as being "scss", okay?
28

28

00:01:16.362  -->  00:01:18.337
So, all of our SASS files will have
29

29

00:01:18.337  -->  00:01:21.087
this "scss" file extension, okay?
30

30

00:01:22.246  -->  00:01:23.523
And, so here it is, so this is
31

31

00:01:23.523  -->  00:01:25.610
our very first SASS file.
32

32

00:01:25.610  -->  00:01:28.610
So, let's open it up and here we go.
33

33

00:01:30.133  -->  00:01:31.472
So, what we can do now,
34

34

00:01:31.472  -->  00:01:32.955
and what I will do,
35

35

00:01:32.955  -->  00:01:34.953
is to simply take all of this code from
36

36

00:01:34.953  -->  00:01:39.120
the "style.css" file and put it into our main file.
37

37

00:01:39.955  -->  00:01:42.748
So I select everything, cut it,
38

38

00:01:42.748  -->  00:01:44.236
and paste it here.
39

39

00:01:44.236  -->  00:01:45.828
And save it, of course.
40

40

00:01:45.828  -->  00:01:47.030
And, that's it.
41

41

00:01:47.030  -->  00:01:49.082
So, remember, that with "Sassy CSS,"
42

42

00:01:49.082  -->  00:01:51.364
so with "SCSS" it's way easier to convert
43

43

00:01:51.364  -->  00:01:53.531
original CSS code to SASS.
44

44

00:01:54.464  -->  00:01:57.547
Because valid CSS is also valid SCSS.
45

45

00:01:58.724  -->  00:02:00.590
And so that's what we just did.
46

46

00:02:00.590  -->  00:02:03.293
So, this "style.css," we don't need it anymore
47

47

00:02:03.293  -->  00:02:04.859
because now we're going to start writing
48

48

00:02:04.859  -->  00:02:06.812
our code here in this file.
49

49

00:02:06.812  -->  00:02:08.325
At least for now.
50

50

00:02:08.325  -->  00:02:09.566
So let's put some SASS here
51

51

00:02:09.566  -->  00:02:11.229
so that we can actually try it out.
52

52

00:02:11.229  -->  00:02:13.050
And the best thing to start, I think
53

53

00:02:13.050  -->  00:02:15.397
is just to put in some variables here.
54

54

00:02:15.397  -->  00:02:18.116
Let's just start with the colors again.
55

55

00:02:18.116  -->  00:02:21.415
So I want a color that's primary.
56

56

00:02:21.415  -->  00:02:23.558
So our primary color, it's actually
57

57

00:02:23.558  -->  00:02:25.746
this green color here.
58

58

00:02:25.746  -->  00:02:27.524
So this one's our primary color,
59

59

00:02:27.524  -->  00:02:29.495
our primary green color.
60

60

00:02:29.495  -->  00:02:30.761
And then the other ones,
61

61

00:02:30.761  -->  00:02:32.372
this one is just a lighter version
62

62

00:02:32.372  -->  00:02:36.857
and this one is just a darker version, okay?
63

63

00:02:36.857  -->  00:02:38.857
So "color primary light"
64

64

00:02:40.082  -->  00:02:42.508
(typing)
65

65

00:02:42.508  -->  00:02:44.533
is just this one here.
66

66

00:02:44.533  -->  00:02:46.616
(typing)
67

67

00:02:48.194  -->  00:02:50.527
And the "color primary dark"
68

68

00:02:51.377  -->  00:02:53.460
(typing)
69

69

00:02:54.728  -->  00:02:55.815
is just this one.
70

70

00:02:55.815  -->  00:02:58.270
(typing)
71

71

00:02:58.270  -->  00:03:00.115
Okay, and so here we have some variables.
72

72

00:03:00.115  -->  00:03:03.967
Now I can actually get rid of this comment here.
73

73

00:03:03.967  -->  00:03:06.845
Okay, so we have our three variables here.
74

74

00:03:06.845  -->  00:03:09.105
Now let's use the ones that
75

75

00:03:09.105  -->  00:03:12.002
we actually used already, which are these ones.
76

76

00:03:12.002  -->  00:03:13.316
This one and this one,
77

77

00:03:13.316  -->  00:03:15.394
we used them here in this linear gradient.
78

78

00:03:15.394  -->  00:03:16.511
So what we can do here is
79

79

00:03:16.511  -->  00:03:18.605
to actually replace this.
80

80

00:03:18.605  -->  00:03:20.086
Now what I'm about to do,
81

81

00:03:20.086  -->  00:03:22.129
this only works in SASS.
82

82

00:03:22.129  -->  00:03:23.979
So in regular CSS, we cannot put
83

83

00:03:23.979  -->  00:03:27.303
a hexadecimal color here in the RGBA function,
84

84

00:03:27.303  -->  00:03:29.039
and then some opacity,
85

85

00:03:29.039  -->  00:03:31.090
and then it will translate it to the color.
86

86

00:03:31.090  -->  00:03:32.678
It doesn't work like that.
87

87

00:03:32.678  -->  00:03:36.220
But, here in SASS it does actually work.
88

88

00:03:36.220  -->  00:03:39.834
So I can just put here "color-primary-light."
89

89

00:03:39.834  -->  00:03:41.917
So "color-primary-light."
90

90

00:03:44.235  -->  00:03:48.068
And down here, I can put "color-primary-dark."
91

91

00:03:49.383  -->  00:03:50.917
And you see it's a lot cooler to write
92

92

00:03:50.917  -->  00:03:53.295
SASS here in the real code editor
93

93

00:03:53.295  -->  00:03:55.066
than it was on the code pen,
94

94

00:03:55.066  -->  00:03:58.865
because we have all this cool autocomplete going on here.
95

95

00:03:58.865  -->  00:04:00.385
Okay, so we have our variables,
96

96

00:04:00.385  -->  00:04:02.468
and we have used them here in this place.
97

97

00:04:02.468  -->  00:04:06.280
And so let's now move on and actually compile this.
98

98

00:04:06.280  -->  00:04:07.634
And how do we do that?
99

99

00:04:07.634  -->  00:04:12.278
So, remember we installed our "node-sass" package, right?
100

100

00:04:12.278  -->  00:04:14.061
So how are we going to use it?
101

101

00:04:14.061  -->  00:04:17.328
We use it by writing an NPM script.
102

102

00:04:17.328  -->  00:04:20.289
And, this is the place where we write our scripts.
103

103

00:04:20.289  -->  00:04:22.636
So, right here in this "package.json" file,
104

104

00:04:22.636  -->  00:04:25.307
we not only have all of these definitions
105

105

00:04:25.307  -->  00:04:27.290
of the projects and our dependency,
106

106

00:04:27.290  -->  00:04:29.532
we also write scripts here.
107

107

00:04:29.532  -->  00:04:32.175
So we don't need this script here,
108

108

00:04:32.175  -->  00:04:35.864
this was just a predefined script that was here, okay?
109

109

00:04:35.864  -->  00:04:38.706
So now we can write our own script.
110

110

00:04:38.706  -->  00:04:41.539
I'm going to call it "compilesass"
111

111

00:04:45.162  -->  00:04:47.904
and then in here we can write our command.
112

112

00:04:47.904  -->  00:04:49.373
And how does this command work?
113

113

00:04:49.373  -->  00:04:52.224
Well, we start with "node-sass",
114

114

00:04:52.224  -->  00:04:54.256
which is the name of the package
115

115

00:04:54.256  -->  00:04:56.266
then we have to specify our SASS file,
116

116

00:04:56.266  -->  00:04:57.740
which is the input file,
117

117

00:04:57.740  -->  00:05:00.530
and then we specify which is the output file,
118

118

00:05:00.530  -->  00:05:03.289
so the compiled CSS file.
119

119

00:05:03.289  -->  00:05:05.040
So this is like writing "node-sass"
120

120

00:05:05.040  -->  00:05:06.574
right here in the terminal,
121

121

00:05:06.574  -->  00:05:08.265
then the input file and the output file
122

122

00:05:08.265  -->  00:05:09.466
like I was just saying.
123

123

00:05:09.466  -->  00:05:12.079
But, unfortunately that's not going to work.
124

124

00:05:12.079  -->  00:05:14.744
But, what will work is to write a script here
125

125

00:05:14.744  -->  00:05:16.357
in this "package.json" file,
126

126

00:05:16.357  -->  00:05:18.949
and then in the terminal we will call that script
127

127

00:05:18.949  -->  00:05:20.402
with this name here.
128

128

00:05:20.402  -->  00:05:22.767
But I'm going to show you how in a second, okay?
129

129

00:05:22.767  -->  00:05:26.303
Just to let you know why we're actually writing this script.
130

130

00:05:26.303  -->  00:05:28.569
Okay, so again, now we need the input file,
131

131

00:05:28.569  -->  00:05:31.084
so our SASS file, so we need to specify
132

132

00:05:31.084  -->  00:05:33.681
where this file is actually located.
133

133

00:05:33.681  -->  00:05:35.190
And where is it?
134

134

00:05:35.190  -->  00:05:37.537
Well, from the "package.json" file,
135

135

00:05:37.537  -->  00:05:38.824
which is where we are,
136

136

00:05:38.824  -->  00:05:41.212
we need to go into the "sass" file, right,
137

137

00:05:41.212  -->  00:05:44.050
and then select the "main.scss" file.
138

138

00:05:44.050  -->  00:05:46.717
So, "sass/main.scss".
139

139

00:05:48.387  -->  00:05:50.386
So this is our input file.
140

140

00:05:50.386  -->  00:05:52.335
Now the output file, we want it to be
141

141

00:05:52.335  -->  00:05:55.407
actually this one called "style.css".
142

142

00:05:55.407  -->  00:05:59.574
So it is in the "css" folder and called "style.css".
143

143

00:06:02.705  -->  00:06:04.215
And it will then simply overwrite
144

144

00:06:04.215  -->  00:06:05.519
this file that we have here.
145

145

00:06:05.519  -->  00:06:08.991
But it doesn't matter because it's already empty anyway.
146

146

00:06:08.991  -->  00:06:10.901
And now with this code, we're ready to go
147

147

00:06:10.901  -->  00:06:12.992
and ready to try it out, okay?
148

148

00:06:12.992  -->  00:06:13.825
Are you ready?
149

149

00:06:13.825  -->  00:06:14.825
Let's do it.
150

150

00:06:15.682  -->  00:06:17.414
So, back to the terminal.
151

151

00:06:17.414  -->  00:06:19.997
We now write "npn run" and then
152

152

00:06:21.346  -->  00:06:24.596
the name of our script: "compile.sass".
153

153

00:06:27.081  -->  00:06:29.515
So let's try it out now.
154

154

00:06:29.515  -->  00:06:31.549
Okay, so it says "rendering is complete
155

155

00:06:31.549  -->  00:06:35.116
saving css file... write CSS to /Users/jonas"
156

156

00:06:35.116  -->  00:06:36.534
and on "style.css".
157

157

00:06:36.534  -->  00:06:38.794
So let's take a look.
158

158

00:06:38.794  -->  00:06:40.296
And, bam, here it is.
159

159

00:06:40.296  -->  00:06:42.131
So, the variables are not here,
160

160

00:06:42.131  -->  00:06:44.896
the ones that we wrote, here in the top.
161

161

00:06:44.896  -->  00:06:47.746
And you see that our header with the gradient now,
162

162

00:06:47.746  -->  00:06:50.729
it's back to these colors that we had before.
163

163

00:06:50.729  -->  00:06:53.202
So SASS replaced the variable names
164

164

00:06:53.202  -->  00:06:54.896
that we put in our code,
165

165

00:06:54.896  -->  00:06:56.359
so which are this ones.
166

166

00:06:56.359  -->  00:06:58.143
It actually replaced them with
167

167

00:06:58.143  -->  00:07:00.697
our variable definitions that we had in the beginning.
168

168

00:07:00.697  -->  00:07:02.844
So everything is working just fine
169

169

00:07:02.844  -->  00:07:04.962
exactly as expected.
170

170

00:07:04.962  -->  00:07:06.914
So, great, that's great news.
171

171

00:07:06.914  -->  00:07:08.810
It means that everything is working fine
172

172

00:07:08.810  -->  00:07:10.436
and that we're good to go, and
173

173

00:07:10.436  -->  00:07:13.863
good to use SASS now on our local computer.
174

174

00:07:13.863  -->  00:07:16.296
Congratulations to reach this point.
175

175

00:07:16.296  -->  00:07:20.068
This is really great, really cool, okay?
176

176

00:07:20.068  -->  00:07:23.065
And if we now go check out our page,
177

177

00:07:23.065  -->  00:07:24.619
so we can close this one,
178

178

00:07:24.619  -->  00:07:27.032
if we check this out and reload it,
179

179

00:07:27.032  -->  00:07:28.567
then everything works the same,
180

180

00:07:28.567  -->  00:07:29.400
it looks the same,
181

181

00:07:29.400  -->  00:07:31.382
it looks exactly as it was looking
182

182

00:07:31.382  -->  00:07:34.523
as you were still using our CSS code.
183

183

00:07:34.523  -->  00:07:35.533
And that makes a lot of sense,
184

184

00:07:35.533  -->  00:07:38.100
because, of course, as I told you in the beginning,
185

185

00:07:38.100  -->  00:07:40.345
the website, the web page, it never even knows
186

186

00:07:40.345  -->  00:07:42.663
that what we're actually writing is SASS code.
187

187

00:07:42.663  -->  00:07:45.519
Because it only ever knows of the CSS code.
188

188

00:07:45.519  -->  00:07:47.419
Because as you see, what we have here
189

189

00:07:47.419  -->  00:07:50.416
is still called "style.css".
190

190

00:07:50.416  -->  00:07:53.454
And so this final output of our main "sass" file
191

191

00:07:53.454  -->  00:07:55.067
is, of course, what the browser uses
192

192

00:07:55.067  -->  00:07:56.917
to render the web page.
193

193

00:07:56.917  -->  00:07:58.706
And, so we would actually never again
194

194

00:07:58.706  -->  00:08:00.135
have to look at this file,
195

195

00:08:00.135  -->  00:08:03.279
and don't worry about it ever again, okay?
196

196

00:08:03.279  -->  00:08:06.224
Now this is only one of the many, many possible scripts
197

197

00:08:06.224  -->  00:08:07.399
that we could write here.
198

198

00:08:07.399  -->  00:08:09.785
There's so many packages on NPM.
199

199

00:08:09.785  -->  00:08:12.017
There are packages to automatically prefix
200

200

00:08:12.017  -->  00:08:15.203
our code in order to support all of the web browsers.
201

201

00:08:15.203  -->  00:08:19.901
There are packages to compress our code, and so much more.
202

202

00:08:19.901  -->  00:08:21.443
Now one I think that I want to do here
203

203

00:08:21.443  -->  00:08:23.676
before leaving you is to just make
204

204

00:08:23.676  -->  00:08:26.058
one very small change to this.
205

205

00:08:26.058  -->  00:08:28.104
Because imagine that we now keep adding
206

206

00:08:28.104  -->  00:08:30.239
code here to our "sass" file,
207

207

00:08:30.239  -->  00:08:31.403
and actually let's do that,
208

208

00:08:31.403  -->  00:08:34.320
so, for example, we can set a color
209

209

00:08:37.021  -->  00:08:38.938
gray, dark for example.
210

210

00:08:41.386  -->  00:08:43.299
And let's put it to "777".
211

211

00:08:43.299  -->  00:08:44.867
Because we actually already
212

212

00:08:44.867  -->  00:08:46.983
used this color here more than once.
213

213

00:08:46.983  -->  00:08:51.019
And so let's simply replace it with this variable.
214

214

00:08:51.019  -->  00:08:53.109
So, color, gray, dark.
215

215

00:08:53.109  -->  00:08:55.158
And I know that somewhere down here
216

216

00:08:55.158  -->  00:08:58.741
it's repeated, that's actually not a color.
217

217

00:09:00.625  -->  00:09:02.334
And, yeah, so here it is.
218

218

00:09:02.334  -->  00:09:04.417
(typing)
219

219

00:09:06.383  -->  00:09:08.216
So, color, gray, dark.
220

220

00:09:12.714  -->  00:09:15.114
If we wanted now to go check out the page
221

221

00:09:15.114  -->  00:09:16.499
to see if everything worked,
222

222

00:09:16.499  -->  00:09:17.871
then we would, of course, first
223

223

00:09:17.871  -->  00:09:19.880
have to come here to the terminal,
224

224

00:09:19.880  -->  00:09:22.514
then compile our SASS code.
225

225

00:09:22.514  -->  00:09:24.323
And only then would we be ready
226

226

00:09:24.323  -->  00:09:27.370
to check out our page, right?
227

227

00:09:27.370  -->  00:09:29.315
But that's not really practical.
228

228

00:09:29.315  -->  00:09:31.852
And so what we can do,
229

229

00:09:31.852  -->  00:09:33.684
which is something that this "node-sass"
230

230

00:09:33.684  -->  00:09:34.985
package allows us to do,
231

231

00:09:34.985  -->  00:09:37.831
is to keep watching our main "sass" file.
232

232

00:09:37.831  -->  00:09:41.849
So all we have to do is to add the "w-flag",
233

233

00:09:41.849  -->  00:09:45.363
so the "watch" option, because this "w" stands for "watch".
234

234

00:09:45.363  -->  00:09:47.659
And if we know start this process again,
235

235

00:09:47.659  -->  00:09:51.028
it will keep watching for whatever we do in our code.
236

236

00:09:51.028  -->  00:09:52.727
So let's run this again,
237

237

00:09:52.727  -->  00:09:55.984
and remember, just hit the up-arrow.
238

238

00:09:55.984  -->  00:09:57.067
So it's watching for changes.
239

239

00:09:57.067  -->  00:09:58.864
So it's only gonna do something
240

240

00:09:58.864  -->  00:10:02.944
as soon as we change something in the file, okay?
241

241

00:10:02.944  -->  00:10:04.697
So let's just change something,
242

242

00:10:04.697  -->  00:10:08.461
let's just put some space here, save it.
243

243

00:10:08.461  -->  00:10:09.944
Let's check it out.
244

244

00:10:09.944  -->  00:10:11.534
And, here you go.
245

245

00:10:11.534  -->  00:10:12.826
So it detected a change,
246

246

00:10:12.826  -->  00:10:14.212
it compiled the code,
247

247

00:10:14.212  -->  00:10:15.849
and then wrote to "css".
248

248

00:10:15.849  -->  00:10:18.427
So let's take a look now.
249

249

00:10:18.427  -->  00:10:22.636
And, yeah, so, the grey color that we had here
250

250

00:10:22.636  -->  00:10:24.411
is still the same.
251

251

00:10:24.411  -->  00:10:27.277
So if we did some other change here,
252

252

00:10:27.277  -->  00:10:30.959
let's say we want to add a color for white.
253

253

00:10:30.959  -->  00:10:32.225
"color-white"
254

254

00:10:32.225  -->  00:10:34.308
(typing)
255

255

00:10:36.924  -->  00:10:37.757
Okay.
256

256

00:10:37.757  -->  00:10:40.199
Imagine at some point later we want to change
257

257

00:10:40.199  -->  00:10:43.397
the color white to a very light gray, for example.
258

258

00:10:43.397  -->  00:10:45.656
And then instead of going everywhere to change
259

259

00:10:45.656  -->  00:10:49.415
all these FFF codes, you will simply have to change it here.
260

260

00:10:49.415  -->  00:10:50.248
Okay.
261

261

00:10:51.456  -->  00:10:53.687
(typing)
262

262

00:10:53.687  -->  00:10:55.104
So "color-white,"
263

263

00:10:57.535  -->  00:10:59.535
and let me just copy it.
264

264

00:11:01.153  -->  00:11:05.187
Because I've seen it multiple times down here.
265

265

00:11:05.187  -->  00:11:08.235
(mouse clicks and typing sounds)
266

266

00:11:08.235  -->  00:11:09.902
And, let me see now.
267

267

00:11:11.052  -->  00:11:13.877
And so it's, well, it's run into some errors.
268

268

00:11:13.877  -->  00:11:15.245
But that's not really a problem,
269

269

00:11:15.245  -->  00:11:17.278
because here in the end it actually,
270

270

00:11:17.278  -->  00:11:20.097
it wrote our "css" just fine, okay.
271

271

00:11:20.097  -->  00:11:21.331
This is probably because I have
272

272

00:11:21.331  -->  00:11:23.203
autosave enabled in my browser,
273

273

00:11:23.203  -->  00:11:25.313
and so I think that each time I type something
274

274

00:11:25.313  -->  00:11:28.238
it triggers a compilation of the SASS code.
275

275

00:11:28.238  -->  00:11:29.895
And so sometimes the code is not correct,
276

276

00:11:29.895  -->  00:11:32.396
and then it will give us this error.
277

277

00:11:32.396  -->  00:11:33.321
But we should be fine,
278

278

00:11:33.321  -->  00:11:34.813
so let's just check if everything
279

279

00:11:34.813  -->  00:11:36.809
that was white is still white.
280

280

00:11:36.809  -->  00:11:37.866
And it is.
281

281

00:11:37.866  -->  00:11:40.548
And, of course, we can confirm it in the code.
282

282

00:11:40.548  -->  00:11:42.788
So our gray color is still here, and
283

283

00:11:42.788  -->  00:11:44.777
our white color is still here.
284

284

00:11:44.777  -->  00:11:47.766
And so everything is still working the same, right?
285

285

00:11:47.766  -->  00:11:49.798
Okay, so now we have this in place
286

286

00:11:49.798  -->  00:11:50.995
where each time that we write
287

287

00:11:50.995  -->  00:11:53.277
some more SASS code, it automatically compiles
288

288

00:11:53.277  -->  00:11:56.330
and we can then check out our page, our result.
289

289

00:11:56.330  -->  00:11:57.883
The only thing that you have to keep in mind
290

290

00:11:57.883  -->  00:11:59.529
is that you cannot close this window here,
291

291

00:11:59.529  -->  00:12:02.993
this process, because otherwise it will stop.
292

292

00:12:02.993  -->  00:12:04.344
So if you want to use the terminal now,
293

293

00:12:04.344  -->  00:12:07.211
you can actually open a new tab,
294

294

00:12:07.211  -->  00:12:08.727
at least that's now it works on a Mac,
295

295

00:12:08.727  -->  00:12:10.515
just hit Command-T,
296

296

00:12:10.515  -->  00:12:13.152
and so now you can write your commands in here,
297

297

00:12:13.152  -->  00:12:15.543
because as long as this one here is working
298

298

00:12:15.543  -->  00:12:18.781
you cannot write anything new here in this console,
299

299

00:12:18.781  -->  00:12:20.049
in this terminal window,
300

300

00:12:20.049  -->  00:12:22.011
and so you have to open a new one.
301

301

00:12:22.011  -->  00:12:23.730
Now in Windows, I think you can just use
302

302

00:12:23.730  -->  00:12:25.292
another command prompt, by again
303

303

00:12:25.292  -->  00:12:27.869
right-clicking the "Start" button,
304

304

00:12:27.869  -->  00:12:30.379
and then choosing "Command Prompt" from there.
305

305

00:12:30.379  -->  00:12:31.721
That should open you a new window
306

306

00:12:31.721  -->  00:12:34.547
where you can also write the next commands.
307

307

00:12:34.547  -->  00:12:36.200
And if you want this process to stop,
308

308

00:12:36.200  -->  00:12:38.594
the SASS process, if you want to stop it,
309

309

00:12:38.594  -->  00:12:41.611
to compile, then you just close this tab here
310

310

00:12:41.611  -->  00:12:42.998
and then it's gone.
311

311

00:12:42.998  -->  00:12:45.178
Alright, and so with this we're well on our way
312

312

00:12:45.178  -->  00:12:49.228
to set up a very nice development environment here for us.
313

313

00:12:49.228  -->  00:12:50.980
Now only one thing is left,
314

314

00:12:50.980  -->  00:12:52.909
and we're gonna do that in the next lecture,
315

315

00:12:52.909  -->  00:12:54.240
which is to actually trigger
316

316

00:12:54.240  -->  00:12:56.249
an automatic reload each time
317

317

00:12:56.249  -->  00:12:58.141
that we change our page.
318

318

00:12:58.141  -->  00:13:00.065
So automatically reloading this page
319

319

00:13:00.065  -->  00:13:01.756
each time that we change something.
320

320

00:13:01.756  -->  00:13:03.936
So check out the next lecture to
321

321

00:13:03.936  -->  00:13:06.269
learn everything about that.
