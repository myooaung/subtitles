00:00:01,754  -->  00:00:03,817
<v Instructor>Let's continue writing our media queries</v>
2

2

00:00:03,817  -->  00:00:05,817
right now in this video.
3

3

00:00:06,822  -->  00:00:09,092
So, remember from the last video, where I had this
4

4

00:00:09,092  -->  00:00:11,372
weird thing going on at the very end of the video
5

5

00:00:11,372  -->  00:00:13,778
where it scroll, like, to the sides here?
6

6

00:00:13,778  -->  00:00:16,077
Well, it turns out that it had nothing to do with
7

7

00:00:16,077  -->  00:00:19,421
the media queries, but it was a bug here in the dev tools,
8

8

00:00:19,421  -->  00:00:22,095
so all I had to do was to click here to go back to
9

9

00:00:22,095  -->  00:00:24,460
normal state, then click it again, then everything
10

10

00:00:24,460  -->  00:00:26,542
was back to normal, okay?
11

11

00:00:26,542  -->  00:00:31,227
So maybe that happens to you also, and so, that is the fix.
12

12

00:00:31,227  -->  00:00:35,730
So, just toggle this, remove the state, and then come back.
13

13

00:00:35,730  -->  00:00:37,539
Okay, so that fixed it for me.
14

14

00:00:37,539  -->  00:00:39,987
It had nothing to do with the media queries.
15

15

00:00:39,987  -->  00:00:41,014
Alright.
16

16

00:00:41,014  -->  00:00:42,616
And actually, we had not yet finished the footer here.
17

17

00:00:42,616  -->  00:00:44,940
We wanted to decrease the space here, right?
18

18

00:00:44,940  -->  00:00:48,690
So let's quickly do that here, in the footer.
19

19

00:00:51,055  -->  00:00:53,805
So, it was here, at the logo box.
20

20

00:00:55,277  -->  00:00:59,982
So, the margin bottom, let's set it to, like...
21

21

00:00:59,982  -->  00:01:03,114
4rem only, that should be enough, why not?
22

22

00:01:03,114  -->  00:01:04,977
Okay, maybe six.
23

23

00:01:04,977  -->  00:01:07,661
And then we're good to go.
24

24

00:01:07,661  -->  00:01:11,609
So, save, close, and let's now move on.
25

25

00:01:11,609  -->  00:01:13,967
So, we took care of all of these now, of all of these
26

26

00:01:13,967  -->  00:01:17,567
four layout components, so let's now take care
27

27

00:01:17,567  -->  00:01:19,150
of the page itself.
28

28

00:01:20,244  -->  00:01:24,411
So, let's take a look, actually, before we do anything.
29

29

00:01:26,354  -->  00:01:29,039
So, that's looks good now.
30

30

00:01:29,039  -->  00:01:31,131
And now, let's see.
31

31

00:01:31,131  -->  00:01:35,298
So I think we have way too much space here in general, okay?
32

32

00:01:36,551  -->  00:01:39,204
So this is too much space, this is too much,
33

33

00:01:39,204  -->  00:01:40,621
this is too much.
34

34

00:01:42,170  -->  00:01:45,038
And so, all of these sections, they have too much padding.
35

35

00:01:45,038  -->  00:01:47,747
Let me see where that starts.
36

36

00:01:47,747  -->  00:01:50,582
And yeah, I think already here, at the 900 pixel,
37

37

00:01:50,582  -->  00:01:53,255
so at the tablet portrait mode, it already starts
38

38

00:01:53,255  -->  00:01:56,137
to have too much padding.
39

39

00:01:56,137  -->  00:01:57,248
Okay.
40

40

00:01:57,248  -->  00:02:01,415
And so, let's actually remove at least part of that, okay?
41

41

00:02:03,410  -->  00:02:07,577
So, include, respond and tab-port.
42

42

00:02:12,178  -->  00:02:14,845
So, the section-about has 25rem.
43

43

00:02:16,271  -->  00:02:19,354
So let's decrease that to 20 0, okay?
44

44

00:02:24,687  -->  00:02:26,700
And yeah, that's better, okay?
45

45

00:02:26,700  -->  00:02:28,865
The same thing here, okay.
46

46

00:02:28,865  -->  00:02:30,019
It's definitely better as well.
47

47

00:02:30,019  -->  00:02:32,323
And I see we also have too much space here.
48

48

00:02:32,323  -->  00:02:35,243
So this one here is definitely too much space as well.
49

49

00:02:35,243  -->  00:02:36,985
But let's take care of that later.
50

50

00:02:36,985  -->  00:02:41,085
Let's continue for now with the layout of the page.
51

51

00:02:41,085  -->  00:02:44,486
So, we removed five rem from that padding,
52

52

00:02:44,486  -->  00:02:49,100
so let's probably do the same thing here in the features.
53

53

00:02:49,100  -->  00:02:51,683
So, 15 in here.
54

54

00:02:54,455  -->  00:02:56,978
Then section-tours, 25, 15.
55

55

00:02:56,978  -->  00:02:59,722
And this is different, so this one is much larger
56

56

00:02:59,722  -->  00:03:04,234
than this one, simply because of the fact that we have
57

57

00:03:04,234  -->  00:03:07,377
this non-rectangular shape here, so we have to give it
58

58

00:03:07,377  -->  00:03:12,073
a bit more space in order to look more natural.
59

59

00:03:12,073  -->  00:03:16,240
So, let's copy this one, then remove five on each side,
60

60

00:03:18,199  -->  00:03:20,032
such as we did before.
61

61

00:03:22,322  -->  00:03:23,155
Okay.
62

62

00:03:24,186  -->  00:03:25,853
Let's copy it again.
63

63

00:03:26,794  -->  00:03:28,127
Section-stories.
64

64

00:03:29,811  -->  00:03:30,644
Okay.
65

65

00:03:32,959  -->  00:03:34,292
So, 10rem and 0.
66

66

00:03:36,117  -->  00:03:37,700
And the same thing.
67

67

00:03:39,959  -->  00:03:42,153
Here, on this one.
68

68

00:03:42,153  -->  00:03:44,748
Well, it actually doesn't have, okay, sorry,
69

69

00:03:44,748  -->  00:03:46,573
so this is not off the sections, this is already
70

70

00:03:46,573  -->  00:03:47,863
part of the booking, okay?
71

71

00:03:47,863  -->  00:03:50,909
So let's leave that one for later.
72

72

00:03:50,909  -->  00:03:52,742
Let's take a look now.
73

73

00:03:55,146  -->  00:03:57,964
And so, we definitely have decreased space now,
74

74

00:03:57,964  -->  00:04:00,631
and it looks better than before.
75

75

00:04:01,812  -->  00:04:03,982
We could probably decrease it even a bit more
76

76

00:04:03,982  -->  00:04:08,149
for the mobile, okay, but, well, we can leave it as well.
77

77

00:04:11,207  -->  00:04:12,957
So, 900 is this here.
78

78

00:04:14,059  -->  00:04:15,366
Looks okay on a tablet.
79

79

00:04:15,366  -->  00:04:19,033
Let's take a look, for example, at the iPad.
80

80

00:04:20,348  -->  00:04:22,267
And that looks acceptable for me.
81

81

00:04:22,267  -->  00:04:24,517
Now, iPhone 6, for example.
82

82

00:04:26,695  -->  00:04:27,528
And...
83

83

00:04:29,636  -->  00:04:31,143
Looks okay to me as well.
84

84

00:04:31,143  -->  00:04:32,792
Now, remember what I told you before.
85

85

00:04:32,792  -->  00:04:34,710
We have to test this on real devices so we have
86

86

00:04:34,710  -->  00:04:38,136
a real impression of what stuff looks like,
87

87

00:04:38,136  -->  00:04:40,389
but obviously, in this course, we cannot do that.
88

88

00:04:40,389  -->  00:04:42,303
But you should definitely try it
89

89

00:04:42,303  -->  00:04:44,631
when you build your own sites.
90

90

00:04:44,631  -->  00:04:47,061
Now, as I was telling, let's decrease the space here
91

91

00:04:47,061  -->  00:04:48,840
that we have there.
92

92

00:04:48,840  -->  00:04:51,590
So, what's causing this is the...
93

93

00:04:54,453  -->  00:04:55,736
Let me show it to you.
94

94

00:04:55,736  -->  00:04:58,797
It's this class, more down.
95

95

00:04:58,797  -->  00:05:02,392
So it's this margin-button-big, okay?
96

96

00:05:02,392  -->  00:05:04,286
And it's one of the utilities, and so, of course,
97

97

00:05:04,286  -->  00:05:07,543
we can add media queries here as well.
98

98

00:05:07,543  -->  00:05:10,960
So, 8rem currently, so let's change that.
99

99

00:05:19,567  -->  00:05:22,388
Let's put, like, 5rem or something like that, okay?
100

100

00:05:22,388  -->  00:05:25,838
And now, since we're at that, let's do the same thing here
101

101

00:05:25,838  -->  00:05:27,921
for the medium one, okay?
102

102

00:05:33,409  -->  00:05:36,159
So let's put, like, 3rem in here.
103

103

00:05:36,999  -->  00:05:38,740
And since these have important,
104

104

00:05:38,740  -->  00:05:41,240
I'm gonna put it here as well.
105

105

00:05:46,314  -->  00:05:48,385
And yeah, it's better now, it's definitely
106

106

00:05:48,385  -->  00:05:50,302
better this way, right?
107

107

00:05:51,994  -->  00:05:54,911
Okay, so for the layout, that's it.
108

108

00:05:56,438  -->  00:06:00,121
Right, looks acceptable, as I was saying.
109

109

00:06:00,121  -->  00:06:01,795
And of course, this is far from perfect,
110

110

00:06:01,795  -->  00:06:05,693
because I'm not really 100% optimizing this webpage here.
111

111

00:06:05,693  -->  00:06:08,648
Because it's not a project that is going to a real client,
112

112

00:06:08,648  -->  00:06:11,274
so if you want this to be 100% real for yourself,
113

113

00:06:11,274  -->  00:06:13,399
then you should probably go ahead and tweak this even more
114

114

00:06:13,399  -->  00:06:15,562
and test the hell out of it, so that it becomes
115

115

00:06:15,562  -->  00:06:17,992
really polished, but I am here just fixing
116

116

00:06:17,992  -->  00:06:20,075
the major problems, okay?
117

117

00:06:21,813  -->  00:06:24,466
And, well, the major problem that I see here next
118

118

00:06:24,466  -->  00:06:25,854
is this one, okay?
119

119

00:06:25,854  -->  00:06:28,931
So let's now move on to the next component.
120

120

00:06:28,931  -->  00:06:33,089
Actually, it's the first component that we're working on.
121

121

00:06:33,089  -->  00:06:35,964
And that is called the composition, okay?
122

122

00:06:35,964  -->  00:06:38,793
And here we have to do some real major changes,
123

123

00:06:38,793  -->  00:06:41,558
and let me actually show you how I want this to look
124

124

00:06:41,558  -->  00:06:45,173
in the final version, so let's do something like this.
125

125

00:06:45,173  -->  00:06:48,142
Okay, so we have, basically, the images side by side.
126

126

00:06:48,142  -->  00:06:50,204
This one here is a bit bigger than the other two,
127

127

00:06:50,204  -->  00:06:53,536
so it, like, scaled, and looking as if it was on the top,
128

128

00:06:53,536  -->  00:06:56,626
but then I'll configure it in a slightly different way than
129

129

00:06:56,626  -->  00:07:00,793
we were before, so that they don't occupy so much space.
130

130

00:07:02,174  -->  00:07:03,674
So, let's do that.
131

131

00:07:04,604  -->  00:07:08,324
And we need to make a lot of changes here, so starting with
132

132

00:07:08,324  -->  00:07:10,781
the photo, of course, because that's where the image itself
133

133

00:07:10,781  -->  00:07:14,614
is, so include respond, and let's actually see
134

134

00:07:17,314  -->  00:07:22,043
where this starts to look really bad, like this.
135

135

00:07:22,043  -->  00:07:25,486
And we see, okay, that it's happening...
136

136

00:07:25,486  -->  00:07:27,707
Again, at the 900-pixel range here,
137

137

00:07:27,707  -->  00:07:29,907
so at the tablet portrait, okay?
138

138

00:07:29,907  -->  00:07:31,407
So tab-port, okay?
139

139

00:07:33,785  -->  00:07:35,614
So what are we going to do with these?
140

140

00:07:35,614  -->  00:07:38,639
We will float them side-by-side basically.
141

141

00:07:38,639  -->  00:07:39,972
So, float: left.
142

142

00:07:41,616  -->  00:07:43,204
And for that to work, we need them to have
143

143

00:07:43,204  -->  00:07:46,051
a relative position again.
144

144

00:07:46,051  -->  00:07:50,157
Because, remember up here, we have an absolute positioning,
145

145

00:07:50,157  -->  00:07:53,460
but we're now getting rid of that, okay?
146

146

00:07:53,460  -->  00:07:57,017
Also, I want the width to be the same for all,
147

147

00:07:57,017  -->  00:08:00,684
so 33.33333%,
148

148

00:08:02,176  -->  00:08:05,340
and then I also want them to have a slightly less
149

149

00:08:05,340  -->  00:08:07,757
pronounced shadow, let's see.
150

150

00:08:08,666  -->  00:08:12,659
So, like, only three for the blur, not like this,
151

151

00:08:12,659  -->  00:08:17,503
and then here, just 20% for the black color, okay?
152

152

00:08:17,503  -->  00:08:22,400
And then I also have to undo some of this stuff that is here
153

153

00:08:22,400  -->  00:08:26,847
on each of these elements, so let's do that.
154

154

00:08:26,847  -->  00:08:28,764
So top, set it to zero.
155

155

00:08:32,296  -->  00:08:35,629
And then some changes down here as well.
156

156

00:08:38,071  -->  00:08:40,086
So, top to zero here as well.
157

157

00:08:40,086  -->  00:08:42,375
And then, what do we have here?
158

158

00:08:42,375  -->  00:08:47,048
We have left 20%, we don't want anything like that.
159

159

00:08:47,048  -->  00:08:48,171
Left: 0.
160

160

00:08:48,171  -->  00:08:52,305
And actually, let me go to top: 0 back here.
161

161

00:08:52,305  -->  00:08:55,709
Now, remember that we had some of them scale up a bit,
162

162

00:08:55,709  -->  00:08:58,676
so let's take a look before we start that.
163

163

00:08:58,676  -->  00:09:02,217
Alright, so now they are nicely sitting side-by-side.
164

164

00:09:02,217  -->  00:09:04,728
That's a lot better than what we had before already.
165

165

00:09:04,728  -->  00:09:07,242
But let's now, in order to make this a bit more creative,
166

166

00:09:07,242  -->  00:09:10,108
let's just slightly scale this one up,
167

167

00:09:10,108  -->  00:09:12,971
and this one here as well.
168

168

00:09:12,971  -->  00:09:15,888
Or, actually, all of them, why not?
169

169

00:09:18,806  -->  00:09:22,889
So, the one in the middle can be the biggest one.
170

170

00:09:27,578  -->  00:09:31,731
This one slightly smaller than this here.
171

171

00:09:31,731  -->  00:09:33,046
Even smaller than that.
172

172

00:09:33,046  -->  00:09:37,597
Now, another thing that we can do is to put some top here.
173

173

00:09:37,597  -->  00:09:40,680
So, 1rem instead of zero that we had.
174

174

00:09:41,614  -->  00:09:43,197
So, to move this one down a bit,
175

175

00:09:43,197  -->  00:09:45,864
and then move this one up a bit.
176

176

00:09:47,609  -->  00:09:48,442
So, -1rem.
177

177

00:09:50,059  -->  00:09:52,343
So, take a look at that now.
178

178

00:09:52,343  -->  00:09:54,975
Well, that doesn't look okay, so looks like transform
179

179

00:09:54,975  -->  00:09:56,614
didn't really apply.
180

180

00:09:56,614  -->  00:09:58,467
Transform: translate.
181

181

00:09:58,467  -->  00:10:02,154
And, of course, that's not what I wanted at all.
182

182

00:10:02,154  -->  00:10:03,404
I wanted scale.
183

183

00:10:04,453  -->  00:10:06,581
Stupid mistake, again.
184

184

00:10:06,581  -->  00:10:09,257
And, no, that looks a bit better than before.
185

185

00:10:09,257  -->  00:10:11,004
Now, all we have to change is to put this one here
186

186

00:10:11,004  -->  00:10:14,548
on the top, so let's give it a higher Z index
187

187

00:10:14,548  -->  00:10:15,905
than the rest of them.
188

188

00:10:15,905  -->  00:10:17,488
Let's say just 100.
189

189

00:10:20,052  -->  00:10:20,885
Alright.
190

190

00:10:21,995  -->  00:10:24,992
And actually, this effect here still works,
191

191

00:10:24,992  -->  00:10:27,614
but on a touch device, this is not really gonna happen
192

192

00:10:27,614  -->  00:10:30,951
anyway, so you can just ignore that one, okay?
193

193

00:10:30,951  -->  00:10:33,335
So, I like this section as it is right now,
194

194

00:10:33,335  -->  00:10:36,395
so let's move on here to the next one.
195

195

00:10:36,395  -->  00:10:37,947
And what I would change in here is maybe give it
196

196

00:10:37,947  -->  00:10:41,535
a bit less padding and decrease this kind of spacing here,
197

197

00:10:41,535  -->  00:10:45,317
okay, so just small adjustment, and then we should
198

198

00:10:45,317  -->  00:10:46,861
be good to go as well.
199

199

00:10:46,861  -->  00:10:49,316
So, composition, and where is this one,
200

200

00:10:49,316  -->  00:10:50,913
ah, it's a feature box.
201

201

00:10:50,913  -->  00:10:55,557
And I'm doing it in the same breakpoint again.
202

202

00:10:55,557  -->  00:10:59,307
So include, respond, tab-port.
203

203

00:11:06,441  -->  00:11:09,608
So, I'll slide degrees of the padding.
204

204

00:11:16,676  -->  00:11:20,843
And then here, the margin can be actually set to zero.
205

205

00:11:22,579  -->  00:11:23,412
Okay, so.
206

206

00:11:25,122  -->  00:11:27,705
Just a really small adjustment.
207

207

00:11:29,083  -->  00:11:31,844
And now, well, I think we still have too much space here,
208

208

00:11:31,844  -->  00:11:35,339
to be honest, so let's decrease the padding that we have
209

209

00:11:35,339  -->  00:11:36,558
in the section.
210

210

00:11:36,558  -->  00:11:38,725
So, back to the home here.
211

211

00:11:40,078  -->  00:11:41,353
Now down here.
212

212

00:11:41,353  -->  00:11:44,770
So section-features.
213

213

00:11:46,643  -->  00:11:49,509
Let's put 10 here as well.
214

214

00:11:49,509  -->  00:11:50,977
And yeah.
215

215

00:11:50,977  -->  00:11:52,930
I prefer it this way.
216

216

00:11:52,930  -->  00:11:55,361
Now it looks more symmetric here, so the space between
217

217

00:11:55,361  -->  00:11:57,510
this one here is now equal, like, the line is right
218

218

00:11:57,510  -->  00:12:00,843
at the middle of these two sections now.
219

219

00:12:02,392  -->  00:12:03,809
So, a lot better.
220

220

00:12:05,838  -->  00:12:08,007
So, we're doing great progress here.
221

221

00:12:08,007  -->  00:12:09,681
Now what we have to do next is to fix
222

222

00:12:09,681  -->  00:12:12,179
these next three sections.
223

223

00:12:12,179  -->  00:12:15,554
So, this one here, the tours, then we can fix
224

224

00:12:15,554  -->  00:12:18,950
this one here, 'cause this looks really messy right now.
225

225

00:12:18,950  -->  00:12:22,009
And then, finally, we fix the booking, alright?
226

226

00:12:22,009  -->  00:12:23,542
But we're gonna leave that for the next lecture
227

227

00:12:23,542  -->  00:12:25,458
so that you can take a quick break here,
228

228

00:12:25,458  -->  00:12:29,125
and then come back to coding this last part.
