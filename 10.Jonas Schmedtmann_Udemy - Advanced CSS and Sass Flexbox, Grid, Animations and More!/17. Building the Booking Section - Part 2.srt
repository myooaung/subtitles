00:00:00,575  -->  00:00:04,260
<v Jonas>Let's continue styling our form in this lecture.</v>
2

2

00:00:04,260  -->  00:00:07,983
So once more we add a new component here,
3

3

00:00:07,983  -->  00:00:10,900
to a components folder so form.scss
4

4

00:00:13,827  -->  00:00:17,994
add .form in here, and of course, also included here.
5

5

00:00:20,157  -->  00:00:22,740
So, form, save it and close it.
6

6

00:00:27,866  -->  00:00:30,650
Alright, so we have the form and in there
7

7

00:00:30,650  -->  00:00:32,567
we have the form input,
8

8

00:00:38,327  -->  00:00:42,749
and of course the form label, at least for now.
9

9

00:00:42,749  -->  00:00:46,249
And of course we also have the form group,
10

10

00:00:49,223  -->  00:00:53,314
and let's start with the input actually, okay?
11

11

00:00:53,314  -->  00:00:56,314
So, font-size of one point five rem,
12

12

00:00:57,505  -->  00:01:02,466
let's give it a nice padding of one point five in the top,
13

13

00:01:02,466  -->  00:01:04,857
and bottom it on two on left and right,
14

14

00:01:04,857  -->  00:01:08,212
And usually we always do it like this on buttons,
15

15

00:01:08,212  -->  00:01:09,257
and form elements.
16

16

00:01:09,257  -->  00:01:11,010
We give it a bit more on the sides
17

17

00:01:11,010  -->  00:01:13,279
because it makes elements look better, actually.
18

18

00:01:13,279  -->  00:01:15,851
If we just give it one point five it looks a bit strange,
19

19

00:01:15,851  -->  00:01:17,928
it looks like it's smaller on the sides
20

20

00:01:17,928  -->  00:01:19,182
than it actually is.
21

21

00:01:19,182  -->  00:01:22,515
So always a bit more on the sides, okay?
22

22

00:01:23,402  -->  00:01:26,411
Now a nice border-radius as well,
23

23

00:01:26,411  -->  00:01:28,360
let's do it on two pixels this time
24

24

00:01:28,360  -->  00:01:31,512
because the element itself is a lot smaller,
25

25

00:01:31,512  -->  00:01:34,812
and then we want it to have a background color
26

26

00:01:34,812  -->  00:01:37,316
where we can look through a bit.
27

27

00:01:37,316  -->  00:01:39,066
So we use rbga again,
28

28

00:01:43,333  -->  00:01:46,666
white, and let's say 50 percent opacity.
29

29

00:01:48,804  -->  00:01:52,401
Also you want to get rid of the border, so 'border: none;'
30

30

00:01:52,401  -->  00:01:54,084
Alright, let's take a look at that
31

31

00:01:54,084  -->  00:01:56,872
before we do anything else.
32

32

00:01:56,872  -->  00:01:59,700
Okay, now the first thing you need to notice
33

33

00:01:59,700  -->  00:02:02,187
is probably the font family, it's not the same
34

34

00:02:02,187  -->  00:02:04,405
as you have in the rest of the webpage.
35

35

00:02:04,405  -->  00:02:06,100
So the font family is not Lato,
36

36

00:02:06,100  -->  00:02:08,759
and that's a default thing that the browsers do, actually.
37

37

00:02:08,759  -->  00:02:12,160
So by default they don't give it the font family
38

38

00:02:12,160  -->  00:02:13,623
that we have for a webpage.
39

39

00:02:13,623  -->  00:02:17,443
So let's edit, and, well, we could do font-family
40

40

00:02:17,443  -->  00:02:20,113
and I'll set it to Lato, but we can do something better
41

41

00:02:20,113  -->  00:02:21,425
with something that we learned,
42

42

00:02:21,425  -->  00:02:22,784
you don't have to theoretic lectures,
43

43

00:02:22,784  -->  00:02:26,951
and we can say the font family directly to inherit.
44

44

00:02:27,817  -->  00:02:28,892
And that's it!
45

45

00:02:28,892  -->  00:02:30,413
And so now it will automatically inherit
46

46

00:02:30,413  -->  00:02:32,224
the font family as well.
47

47

00:02:32,224  -->  00:02:34,186
So you know that usually all elements,
48

48

00:02:34,186  -->  00:02:36,624
they automatically inherit the font family,
49

49

00:02:36,624  -->  00:02:39,289
but not the input elements and so we set it manual here,
50

50

00:02:39,289  -->  00:02:42,388
and then you see it will work now.
51

51

00:02:42,388  -->  00:02:46,220
So slight difference, but it's clearly visible, okay?
52

52

00:02:46,220  -->  00:02:48,507
Now let's just give some space here
53

53

00:02:48,507  -->  00:02:50,260
between these form groups, okay?
54

54

00:02:50,260  -->  00:02:52,130
So you want a margin bottom,
55

55

00:02:52,130  -->  00:02:53,976
but we don't want it on the last one.
56

56

00:02:53,976  -->  00:02:58,006
So, we use our old trick where we start everything
57

57

00:02:58,006  -->  00:02:59,839
except the last child.
58

58

00:03:03,401  -->  00:03:06,965
So margin-bottom let's say two rem,
59

59

00:03:06,965  -->  00:03:09,810
and it will improve things a bit.
60

60

00:03:09,810  -->  00:03:12,074
Okay, what you also saw here was that
61

61

00:03:12,074  -->  00:03:13,513
when we selected to (mumbles) the element,
62

62

00:03:13,513  -->  00:03:16,463
then you saw this blue border here going on,
63

63

00:03:16,463  -->  00:03:18,625
and that's also something that we don't want to see.
64

64

00:03:18,625  -->  00:03:21,433
Now this blue border appears on the input elements
65

65

00:03:21,433  -->  00:03:24,349
when it's focused, so this is the focus state.
66

66

00:03:24,349  -->  00:03:27,131
And in CSS we can actually style it using
67

67

00:03:27,131  -->  00:03:29,982
the focus pseudo element, okay?
68

68

00:03:29,982  -->  00:03:31,399
So let's do that.
69

69

00:03:32,296  -->  00:03:34,218
So instead of active, or hover,
70

70

00:03:34,218  -->  00:03:38,301
or something like that, it's simply called focus.
71

71

00:03:39,859  -->  00:03:42,093
And that blue line that you see is called the outline.
72

72

00:03:42,093  -->  00:03:44,554
So we used outline before, like in the first section
73

73

00:03:44,554  -->  00:03:47,016
in the beginning where we have these three images,
74

74

00:03:47,016  -->  00:03:49,866
and then when we hover, we have this green border
75

75

00:03:49,866  -->  00:03:52,449
around them that's also an outline, okay?
76

76

00:03:52,449  -->  00:03:53,282
But this one is an outline
77

77

00:03:53,282  -->  00:03:54,713
which the browser gives us by default,
78

78

00:03:54,713  -->  00:03:57,996
and we don't want that so we set it to none.
79

79

00:03:57,996  -->  00:04:00,019
Now this focus is actually very important
80

80

00:04:00,019  -->  00:04:02,655
for people who use a webpage without a mouse,
81

81

00:04:02,655  -->  00:04:05,650
but only with a keyboard, and so when they move around
82

82

00:04:05,650  -->  00:04:07,322
with a keyboard on the webpage,
83

83

00:04:07,322  -->  00:04:10,843
they need to know which form elements are actually focused,
84

84

00:04:10,843  -->  00:04:12,584
and so for accessibility reasons,
85

85

00:04:12,584  -->  00:04:14,143
we should never just do input focus,
86

86

00:04:14,143  -->  00:04:17,036
and then set the outline to none and call it a day.
87

87

00:04:17,036  -->  00:04:19,369
So we should always make the form elements
88

88

00:04:19,369  -->  00:04:21,401
that are focused visible, alright?
89

89

00:04:21,401  -->  00:04:25,790
So let's do that and we will do it by giving it a box-shadow
90

90

00:04:25,790  -->  00:04:28,030
and also give it a border at the bottom.
91

91

00:04:28,030  -->  00:04:32,030
So box-shadow: zero, one rem in the y direction,
92

92

00:04:33,452  -->  00:04:37,619
two rem of blur, and then color black with point one.
93

93

00:04:44,975  -->  00:04:48,950
And then, as I said, a border at the bottom,
94

94

00:04:48,950  -->  00:04:52,098
of three pixels, then we say it should be solid,
95

95

00:04:52,098  -->  00:04:56,734
and then we say we want it to be our primary color.
96

96

00:04:56,734  -->  00:04:59,691
So the border is just a short hand property
97

97

00:04:59,691  -->  00:05:03,801
for the border width, the border style, and the border color
98

98

00:05:03,801  -->  00:05:08,060
but it's easy to adjust and specify them all at once here.
99

99

00:05:08,060  -->  00:05:11,104
So let's take a look at that now,
100

100

00:05:11,104  -->  00:05:13,727
and so now we have this nice shadow
101

101

00:05:13,727  -->  00:05:15,076
and the green line as well.
102

102

00:05:15,076  -->  00:05:17,187
Now what you see here is that when you click this
103

103

00:05:17,187  -->  00:05:18,871
you will see that this one here moves down a bit,
104

104

00:05:18,871  -->  00:05:21,702
and that's because of the three pixels that are created here
105

105

00:05:21,702  -->  00:05:23,966
for the border here that's being added,
106

106

00:05:23,966  -->  00:05:28,133
and so what we should do is to actually add that border here
107

107

00:05:30,164  -->  00:05:34,331
in the initial state as well, but reset it to transparent.
108

108

00:05:37,605  -->  00:05:41,111
Alright, and so it will be invisible in the normal state
109

109

00:05:41,111  -->  00:05:43,307
and then as soon as we click it, as it's focused,
110

110

00:05:43,307  -->  00:05:44,956
it becomes the green.
111

111

00:05:44,956  -->  00:05:46,558
Now another thing that I also want to do
112

112

00:05:46,558  -->  00:05:49,537
is to give it a width, so 100 percent,
113

113

00:05:49,537  -->  00:05:53,704
and be sure to (mumbles) add it also display it as a block.
114

114

00:05:56,815  -->  00:06:00,073
So that's better so that it has its own line here.
115

115

00:06:00,073  -->  00:06:03,672
Well maybe it's a bit too much here with the 100 percent,
116

116

00:06:03,672  -->  00:06:05,460
so let's just put it back to 90,
117

117

00:06:05,460  -->  00:06:07,852
but you see that now this effect that we had going on here
118

118

00:06:07,852  -->  00:06:11,672
where this one then jumped up and down is now gone, okay?
119

119

00:06:11,672  -->  00:06:14,412
So let's do that, and another thing that we can do
120

120

00:06:14,412  -->  00:06:17,094
is to actually style the placeholder here,
121

121

00:06:17,094  -->  00:06:20,449
so that's also nice you see that in here it's this really
122

122

00:06:20,449  -->  00:06:23,003
light gray here, and so with that we show
123

123

00:06:23,003  -->  00:06:24,756
that it's actually only a placeholder,
124

124

00:06:24,756  -->  00:06:26,103
and as soon as we start typing,
125

125

00:06:26,103  -->  00:06:29,186
you see that it becomes darker, okay?
126

126

00:06:30,849  -->  00:06:33,932
So let's do that, put 90 percent here
127

127

00:06:36,946  -->  00:06:39,205
let us use a brand new pseudo element,
128

128

00:06:39,205  -->  00:06:43,354
and that one is called webkit-input-placeholder.
129

129

00:06:43,354  -->  00:06:45,771
So, webkit-input-placeholder,
130

130

00:06:49,869  -->  00:06:54,528
and this right now will only work on Safari and Chrome,
131

131

00:06:54,528  -->  00:06:56,186
but hopefully it will get implemented
132

132

00:06:56,186  -->  00:06:57,474
in the other browsers as well.
133

133

00:06:57,474  -->  00:07:00,179
So remember that pseudo elements,
134

134

00:07:00,179  -->  00:07:01,781
they are with these two colons,
135

135

00:07:01,781  -->  00:07:04,834
and they represent things that are actually on the webpage,
136

136

00:07:04,834  -->  00:07:06,390
and so a placeholder is, of course,
137

137

00:07:06,390  -->  00:07:08,968
a pseudo element, and not just a pseudo class,
138

138

00:07:08,968  -->  00:07:11,545
which stands more for states here like focus.
139

139

00:07:11,545  -->  00:07:15,144
So let us dial the color for this one here,
140

140

00:07:15,144  -->  00:07:17,536
and so I guess we now need a new variable,
141

141

00:07:17,536  -->  00:07:20,612
because this is a new color that we don't have yet.
142

142

00:07:20,612  -->  00:07:23,112
So, this is another dark gray,
143

143

00:07:25,164  -->  00:07:28,461
color dark the gray or gray-dark,
144

144

00:07:28,461  -->  00:07:30,156
and I'm gonna call this one number two,
145

145

00:07:30,156  -->  00:07:32,756
and so this one really should be number one
146

146

00:07:32,756  -->  00:07:33,980
but I don't really want to change it now
147

147

00:07:33,980  -->  00:07:35,835
because then I have to go to the place
148

148

00:07:35,835  -->  00:07:38,588
where I used this here and change the variable name.
149

149

00:07:38,588  -->  00:07:40,515
So we should have actually thought about this
150

150

00:07:40,515  -->  00:07:41,769
right from the beginning,
151

151

00:07:41,769  -->  00:07:45,936
but, well, that wasn't the case so now we can't use that.
152

152

00:07:47,274  -->  00:07:50,024
So let's use that color actually.
153

153

00:07:51,391  -->  00:07:52,224
Ah, here it is.
154

154

00:07:52,224  -->  00:07:53,203
So we don't need the home anymore,
155

155

00:07:53,203  -->  00:07:56,953
I will actually call this variable name here,
156

156

00:07:59,965  -->  00:08:03,937
Alright. Now, another thing that I wanted to show you-
157

157

00:08:03,937  -->  00:08:07,969
first, check this one here- well, this didn't really change,
158

158

00:08:07,969  -->  00:08:10,001
well let's check it out again,
159

159

00:08:10,001  -->  00:08:13,275
and yeah, of course I see why it doesn't work,
160

160

00:08:13,275  -->  00:08:16,398
it's because this one is of course not on a form,
161

161

00:08:16,398  -->  00:08:18,476
you see, we are here on the form level,
162

162

00:08:18,476  -->  00:08:20,206
so right now we're saying form
163

163

00:08:20,206  -->  00:08:21,982
and then webkit-input-placeholder,
164

164

00:08:21,982  -->  00:08:25,062
but of course this is on the input.
165

165

00:08:25,062  -->  00:08:27,555
Right, and so this should of course be in here,
166

166

00:08:27,555  -->  00:08:28,821
and since we're at that,
167

167

00:08:28,821  -->  00:08:31,804
this here is also not in the right place,
168

168

00:08:31,804  -->  00:08:35,125
I mean it works, but we're not using
169

169

00:08:35,125  -->  00:08:36,936
the power of nesting here, right?
170

170

00:08:36,936  -->  00:08:40,628
So why I repeat the input should just do it like this.
171

171

00:08:40,628  -->  00:08:44,958
So now it should work, and yeah here we go.
172

172

00:08:44,958  -->  00:08:47,675
So now it's this cont and when I start typing,
173

173

00:08:47,675  -->  00:08:52,038
it becomes dark, and actually it becomes pretty dark
174

174

00:08:52,038  -->  00:08:55,164
it becomes black, and that's because once again
175

175

00:08:55,164  -->  00:08:57,323
the font color is not really inherited.
176

176

00:08:57,323  -->  00:09:01,073
So we have to set this once again to inherit.
177

177

00:09:05,091  -->  00:09:06,919
So that's something really particular
178

178

00:09:06,919  -->  00:09:07,923
to these input elements,
179

179

00:09:07,923  -->  00:09:10,616
they don't inherit basically the font properties.
180

180

00:09:10,616  -->  00:09:13,077
Now another very cool thing that we can do
181

181

00:09:13,077  -->  00:09:15,098
is to actually make use of the validation
182

182

00:09:15,098  -->  00:09:16,340
that Google Chrome has.
183

183

00:09:16,340  -->  00:09:17,791
So remember that I told you
184

184

00:09:17,791  -->  00:09:21,971
that here in the email input for example,
185

185

00:09:21,971  -->  00:09:24,653
we specified the email type and then Google Chrome
186

186

00:09:24,653  -->  00:09:26,394
will test if we're actually writing
187

187

00:09:26,394  -->  00:09:27,880
in a valid email address or not,
188

188

00:09:27,880  -->  00:09:30,725
and if we're not, it will basically be invalid.
189

189

00:09:30,725  -->  00:09:33,395
And, in CSS, we can actually use that,
190

190

00:09:33,395  -->  00:09:35,276
because on an input element,
191

191

00:09:35,276  -->  00:09:38,190
we can actually use the invalid pseudo class, okay?
192

192

00:09:38,190  -->  00:09:41,417
The invalid, and of course also the valid pseudo class,
193

193

00:09:41,417  -->  00:09:43,031
and then we can apply specific styles
194

194

00:09:43,031  -->  00:09:46,399
to when the value is valid, or when it's not valid.
195

195

00:09:46,399  -->  00:09:47,745
So let me show it to you actually,
196

196

00:09:47,745  -->  00:09:50,322
so in here we start with this here yellow,
197

197

00:09:50,322  -->  00:09:51,750
and yellow, or let's say orange,
198

198

00:09:51,750  -->  00:09:53,701
orange means that the input is not correct.
199

199

00:09:53,701  -->  00:09:55,930
So let me start writing something here.
200

200

00:09:55,930  -->  00:10:00,704
So, 'hello', is not really a valid email address.
201

201

00:10:00,704  -->  00:10:03,267
But now, you saw, as soon as I started writing here
202

202

00:10:03,267  -->  00:10:06,517
after the 'at' symbol, it turned green.
203

203

00:10:08,444  -->  00:10:11,471
The same thing here, so we said that it should be required,
204

204

00:10:11,471  -->  00:10:13,368
but right now there's no text, and so it's not valid.
205

205

00:10:13,368  -->  00:10:15,539
So right now if I were to submit this form,
206

206

00:10:15,539  -->  00:10:17,780
and it will say 'please fill out this form'.
207

207

00:10:17,780  -->  00:10:21,216
But if I now start writing here it becomes green,
208

208

00:10:21,216  -->  00:10:23,956
if I delete this one here it gets orange again,
209

209

00:10:23,956  -->  00:10:26,290
and it says 'please fill out this field',
210

210

00:10:26,290  -->  00:10:29,367
and if I just write something invalid,
211

211

00:10:29,367  -->  00:10:32,165
it says 'please include an "at" in the email'.
212

212

00:10:32,165  -->  00:10:36,332
And so we can take advantage of that invalid states.
213

213

00:10:41,489  -->  00:10:45,003
Now I wanna think, when do we actually want this to happen?
214

214

00:10:45,003  -->  00:10:46,443
Well, we want it to happen
215

215

00:10:46,443  -->  00:10:48,893
only when the field is actually focused, right?
216

216

00:10:48,893  -->  00:10:51,342
And so, we set focus once again,
217

217

00:10:51,342  -->  00:10:54,009
and then invalid, and that's it.
218

218

00:10:57,417  -->  00:11:01,408
So when we have an invalid, focused, input element,
219

219

00:11:01,408  -->  00:11:04,055
then this is the style that we want to apply.
220

220

00:11:04,055  -->  00:11:06,972
So we want a border that is orange,
221

221

00:11:09,110  -->  00:11:11,056
and so let me get the color here,
222

222

00:11:11,056  -->  00:11:14,056
so it's called color-secondary-dark.
223

223

00:11:16,542  -->  00:11:19,369
Color-secondary-dark, okay,
224

224

00:11:19,369  -->  00:11:23,119
and that should do the trick, and here it is.
225

225

00:11:25,325  -->  00:11:26,811
So right now it's invalid,
226

226

00:11:26,811  -->  00:11:29,760
and now I typed, and now it is valid.
227

227

00:11:29,760  -->  00:11:32,510
And in here, 'hello at jonas.io',
228

228

00:11:36,540  -->  00:11:39,246
and so now it's valid, like this it's not valid,
229

229

00:11:39,246  -->  00:11:41,393
and like this it's also not valid.
230

230

00:11:41,393  -->  00:11:43,959
Alright, so that works, so now,
231

231

00:11:43,959  -->  00:11:45,608
before we move on to the radio buttons,
232

232

00:11:45,608  -->  00:11:48,812
let's do that trick where we make this part here invisible,
233

233

00:11:48,812  -->  00:11:52,551
and only appear as soon as we write something here
234

234

00:11:52,551  -->  00:11:54,106
in the input, and so basically
235

235

00:11:54,106  -->  00:11:56,161
it will then look like that name here,
236

236

00:11:56,161  -->  00:11:59,981
that text would fly out and come out here down here,
237

237

00:11:59,981  -->  00:12:01,421
because it's actually the same text.
238

238

00:12:01,421  -->  00:12:04,532
So, this effect here, you see the full name,
239

239

00:12:04,532  -->  00:12:06,726
and it moves down like that, okay?
240

240

00:12:06,726  -->  00:12:08,944
So nice little effect,
241

241

00:12:08,944  -->  00:12:10,511
but I think it makes all the difference
242

242

00:12:10,511  -->  00:12:13,425
to have these subtle things on the webpage.
243

243

00:12:13,425  -->  00:12:16,005
So let's know and actually start
244

244

00:12:16,005  -->  00:12:18,505
by formatting here this label.
245

245

00:12:19,350  -->  00:12:23,517
So we give it a pretty small font size of one point two rem,
246

246

00:12:25,973  -->  00:12:28,806
make it bold with 700 font weight,
247

247

00:12:29,935  -->  00:12:31,829
and then we give it a margin-left,
248

248

00:12:31,829  -->  00:12:35,393
with two rem, that's because we want it positioned
249

249

00:12:35,393  -->  00:12:38,853
exactly on the same position which the text is on top,
250

250

00:12:38,853  -->  00:12:41,270
and then a margin to the top,
251

251

00:12:42,334  -->  00:12:44,058
of point seven rem, okay?
252

252

00:12:44,058  -->  00:12:46,728
And finally we should also display this as a block,
253

253

00:12:46,728  -->  00:12:48,296
because otherwise you know
254

254

00:12:48,296  -->  00:12:51,802
we cannot really use these box model properties
255

255

00:12:51,802  -->  00:12:53,056
here on the element, right?
256

256

00:12:53,056  -->  00:12:54,879
So let's take a look at that now,
257

257

00:12:54,879  -->  00:12:58,606
so now you see this is now really aligned here
258

258

00:12:58,606  -->  00:13:01,125
so that the effect will actually work
259

259

00:13:01,125  -->  00:13:02,332
that we're looking for.
260

260

00:13:02,332  -->  00:13:04,469
And now we need to take care of the magic
261

261

00:13:04,469  -->  00:13:06,071
where this is only shown
262

262

00:13:06,071  -->  00:13:08,358
as soon as we have some text in here,
263

263

00:13:08,358  -->  00:13:11,330
and so once again this is really only CSS,
264

264

00:13:11,330  -->  00:13:12,723
and no Javascript included,
265

265

00:13:12,723  -->  00:13:14,987
and what allows us to do this is to use
266

266

00:13:14,987  -->  00:13:17,193
the placeholder shown, pseudo class.
267

267

00:13:17,193  -->  00:13:21,396
And so the placeholder shown is again here on the input.
268

268

00:13:21,396  -->  00:13:23,683
Now I'm not going to really place it here,
269

269

00:13:23,683  -->  00:13:25,831
and I'm gonna explain to you why in a second,
270

270

00:13:25,831  -->  00:13:30,066
but for now trust me that this is how it has to be done.
271

271

00:13:30,066  -->  00:13:33,066
So input and then placeholder shown.
272

272

00:13:39,239  -->  00:13:42,826
So when the placeholder is shown on the input element,
273

273

00:13:42,826  -->  00:13:44,893
then we can (mumbles) style it.
274

274

00:13:44,893  -->  00:13:47,261
But it's not the input that we want to style, right?
275

275

00:13:47,261  -->  00:13:48,968
What we want to style is the label.
276

276

00:13:48,968  -->  00:13:51,092
We want the label to be hidden and not the input,
277

277

00:13:51,092  -->  00:13:55,222
and so in here we also have to select the label.
278

278

00:13:55,222  -->  00:13:59,642
(mumbles) first with like this,
279

279

00:13:59,642  -->  00:14:03,341
but probably you notice that this is not going to work.
280

280

00:14:03,341  -->  00:14:04,572
And why is that?
281

281

00:14:04,572  -->  00:14:08,739
Well, because the label is not a child element of the input.
282

282

00:14:10,675  -->  00:14:13,584
So we see in the HTML that there are siblings
283

283

00:14:13,584  -->  00:14:14,803
so they're at the same level,
284

284

00:14:14,803  -->  00:14:18,321
they're both childs of the form group, okay?
285

285

00:14:18,321  -->  00:14:21,572
So again, input, and label, they are siblings,
286

286

00:14:21,572  -->  00:14:23,046
because they are on the same level,
287

287

00:14:23,046  -->  00:14:25,995
they're both children of this parent element,
288

288

00:14:25,995  -->  00:14:29,176
but in CSS we have a very powerful selector
289

289

00:14:29,176  -->  00:14:32,485
and it is called the sibling selector.
290

290

00:14:32,485  -->  00:14:35,062
And so, this is how it works,
291

291

00:14:35,062  -->  00:14:38,200
and this one is actually the adjacent sibling.
292

292

00:14:38,200  -->  00:14:40,752
So what is an adjacent sibling?
293

293

00:14:40,752  -->  00:14:42,249
Well, it's just a sibling that comes immediately
294

294

00:14:42,249  -->  00:14:45,302
after the element that we select in the first place.
295

295

00:14:45,302  -->  00:14:47,090
So we first select input, and then
296

296

00:14:47,090  -->  00:14:49,238
with the adjacent sibling selector,
297

297

00:14:49,238  -->  00:14:52,233
we select the first sibling, which is the label.
298

298

00:14:52,233  -->  00:14:54,288
And so in this case, this works.
299

299

00:14:54,288  -->  00:14:56,668
But if there was some other element in-between here,
300

300

00:14:56,668  -->  00:14:59,009
let's say here was another div,
301

301

00:14:59,009  -->  00:15:01,568
and then there was like some button or something,
302

302

00:15:01,568  -->  00:15:03,240
so this would totally be possible,
303

303

00:15:03,240  -->  00:15:05,956
then we could still use a sibling selector,
304

304

00:15:05,956  -->  00:15:07,837
but we would have to use this one.
305

305

00:15:07,837  -->  00:15:10,902
So this is the general sibling selector,
306

306

00:15:10,902  -->  00:15:13,596
so this one works if there are more levels in-between,
307

307

00:15:13,596  -->  00:15:15,465
but now we can use the adjacent sibling
308

308

00:15:15,465  -->  00:15:19,632
because the sibling is right next to the first element.
309

309

00:15:20,592  -->  00:15:22,884
Now one particular thing about the sibling selector
310

310

00:15:22,884  -->  00:15:24,974
is that the sibling that we have to select,
311

311

00:15:24,974  -->  00:15:26,611
in this case the label,
312

312

00:15:26,611  -->  00:15:29,757
always has to be after the first element.
313

313

00:15:29,757  -->  00:15:31,324
So the input in this case.
314

314

00:15:31,324  -->  00:15:34,842
So again, the label needs to be after the input,
315

315

00:15:34,842  -->  00:15:37,594
which is the case here, in order to be selected
316

316

00:15:37,594  -->  00:15:39,358
with the sibling selector.
317

317

00:15:39,358  -->  00:15:42,145
So, just as we have it here,
318

318

00:15:42,145  -->  00:15:44,130
so we have to input, and then we select
319

319

00:15:44,130  -->  00:15:48,588
the sibling of that element, and a sibling called 'label'.
320

320

00:15:48,588  -->  00:15:51,189
If the HTML was written the other way around,
321

321

00:15:51,189  -->  00:15:55,276
so if we had to label before the input, like this,
322

322

00:15:55,276  -->  00:15:58,155
this wouldn't work, there would be no way of selecting
323

323

00:15:58,155  -->  00:15:59,908
the label here from the input.
324

324

00:15:59,908  -->  00:16:03,855
And that's the reason why I wrote the HTML in this order.
325

325

00:16:03,855  -->  00:16:07,246
Alright, so when you need to use the sibling selector,
326

326

00:16:07,246  -->  00:16:10,496
then you need to be careful about that.
327

327

00:16:11,477  -->  00:16:13,631
So, when a placeholder is shown,
328

328

00:16:13,631  -->  00:16:16,568
meaning that we have written nothing in our input,
329

329

00:16:16,568  -->  00:16:18,368
we want the label to be hidden, right?
330

330

00:16:18,368  -->  00:16:22,791
So, opacity zero, and then another thing that we should do
331

331

00:16:22,791  -->  00:16:26,402
is to set the visibility to hidden.
332

332

00:16:26,402  -->  00:16:29,304
That's because if we just set the opacity to zero,
333

333

00:16:29,304  -->  00:16:32,300
then the element will basically still be on the page,
334

334

00:16:32,300  -->  00:16:35,423
but only invisible, but if we set it to visibility hidden
335

335

00:16:35,423  -->  00:16:38,503
as well, well, then it's really gone.
336

336

00:16:38,503  -->  00:16:41,147
So why don't we just use the visibility hidden
337

337

00:16:41,147  -->  00:16:42,691
without the opacity?
338

338

00:16:42,691  -->  00:16:45,651
Well, because we cannot animate the visibility, okay?
339

339

00:16:45,651  -->  00:16:47,532
That's how we use the opacity,
340

340

00:16:47,532  -->  00:16:50,179
because we actually want to animate this effect,
341

341

00:16:50,179  -->  00:16:52,339
and actually let me show it to you,
342

342

00:16:52,339  -->  00:16:55,506
So, setting the transition here to all
343

343

00:17:00,657  -->  00:17:01,998
in point three seconds,
344

344

00:17:01,998  -->  00:17:06,811
and then you will already start seeing the effect.
345

345

00:17:06,811  -->  00:17:09,936
So reload, and so now it's gone,
346

346

00:17:09,936  -->  00:17:13,262
meaning that right now the placeholder shown, pseudo class,
347

347

00:17:13,262  -->  00:17:15,724
is active and so right now,
348

348

00:17:15,724  -->  00:17:18,313
this selector here is working,
349

349

00:17:18,313  -->  00:17:21,331
so placeholder is shown, but as soon as we start writing,
350

350

00:17:21,331  -->  00:17:22,620
the placeholder is gone,
351

351

00:17:22,620  -->  00:17:25,743
and then these styles here will be gone as well.
352

352

00:17:25,743  -->  00:17:27,519
So that's what happens now.
353

353

00:17:27,519  -->  00:17:30,968
So you saw the opacity was animated,
354

354

00:17:30,968  -->  00:17:33,023
and so it faded in, now it faded out,
355

355

00:17:33,023  -->  00:17:35,762
in, out, in, out, you see?
356

356

00:17:35,762  -->  00:17:37,330
Now what we want is to happen
357

357

00:17:37,330  -->  00:17:39,849
is to also move down from here, right?
358

358

00:17:39,849  -->  00:17:43,516
And so an initial state, it has to be there,
359

359

00:17:44,623  -->  00:17:48,790
transform, translate, and of course it's in the y direction,
360

360

00:17:51,025  -->  00:17:54,358
and it's going up and so minus four rem.
361

361

00:17:55,433  -->  00:17:59,600
Let's actually show it to you how it will look like
362

362

00:18:01,166  -->  00:18:05,980
still visible so to justify why I used the minus four rem,
363

363

00:18:05,980  -->  00:18:08,464
so this is where the input is,
364

364

00:18:08,464  -->  00:18:12,631
in this statement as I start writing it moves down.
365

365

00:18:14,192  -->  00:18:16,510
Let's make it invisible again,
366

366

00:18:16,510  -->  00:18:17,760
give it a save,
367

367

00:18:19,088  -->  00:18:21,479
and now, here we go.
368

368

00:18:21,479  -->  00:18:23,406
So, really cool right?
369

369

00:18:23,406  -->  00:18:26,030
In the next lecture, we will then take care
370

370

00:18:26,030  -->  00:18:29,013
of actually adding these radio buttons here.
371

371

00:18:29,013  -->  00:18:32,096
So, stay tuned for that next lecture.
