00:00:01.126  -->  00:00:03.354
<v Narrator>So, this is the third and last part</v>
2

2

00:00:03.354  -->  00:00:05.455
of writing our media queries,
3

3

00:00:05.455  -->  00:00:08.110
and this time, we're make the tours, the stories,
4

4

00:00:08.110  -->  00:00:11.442
and the book sections responsive.
5

5

00:00:11.442  -->  00:00:13.215
So, starting with the tours,
6

6

00:00:13.215  -->  00:00:15.053
this is what it looks like, right now.
7

7

00:00:15.053  -->  00:00:17.147
Now, it actually doesn't look so bad,
8

8

00:00:17.147  -->  00:00:18.330
but the big problem here is
9

9

00:00:18.330  -->  00:00:20.614
that we have to, actually, touch it,
10

10

00:00:20.614  -->  00:00:22.056
in order to rotate the cart.
11

11

00:00:22.056  -->  00:00:25.492
Because on touch devices, there's no such thing as a hover,
12

12

00:00:25.492  -->  00:00:28.902
and so, the only way to actually move the cart,
13

13

00:00:28.902  -->  00:00:30.029
is to click it,
14

14

00:00:30.029  -->  00:00:31.378
and that's not practical, right?
15

15

00:00:31.378  -->  00:00:32.692
We don't want this, here,
16

16

00:00:32.692  -->  00:00:35.779
to sit at the back of our cart, right?
17

17

00:00:35.779  -->  00:00:38.254
So, we must find a way to, actually,
18

18

00:00:38.254  -->  00:00:39.887
change the entire cart, okay?
19

19

00:00:39.887  -->  00:00:42.800
So, this will be half a rewrite of this cart.
20

20

00:00:42.800  -->  00:00:44.088
And what I have in mind for this...
21

21

00:00:44.088  -->  00:00:46.586
So, what I want to achieve, in the end,
22

22

00:00:46.586  -->  00:00:49.465
is just something like this. Okay?
23

23

00:00:49.465  -->  00:00:52.326
Let me close this one, here, a bit.
24

24

00:00:52.326  -->  00:00:55.318
All right. So, this entire cart will be like this.
25

25

00:00:55.318  -->  00:00:56.943
So, this is similar to what we had before,
26

26

00:00:56.943  -->  00:00:58.525
then the list, and then the part
27

27

00:00:58.525  -->  00:00:59.898
that was originally on the back,
28

28

00:00:59.898  -->  00:01:02.925
will now be here, at the bottom. Okay?
29

29

00:01:02.925  -->  00:01:07.008
And then that three times; one after the other.
30

30

00:01:07.008  -->  00:01:10.280
All right, and this way, people can actually see the price,
31

31

00:01:10.280  -->  00:01:13.528
and click, "Book now, " if they want to.
32

32

00:01:13.528  -->  00:01:16.936
So, let's go ahead and do that.
33

33

00:01:16.936  -->  00:01:18.749
And once again, we're starting at the...
34

34

00:01:18.749  -->  00:01:21.264
Of course, at the 900 pixel media query,
35

35

00:01:21.264  -->  00:01:22.847
so tablet portrait.
36

36

00:01:24.466  -->  00:01:26.759
So, let's open up that cart.
37

37

00:01:26.759  -->  00:01:28.392
Here it is, and this time,
38

38

00:01:28.392  -->  00:01:30.933
we are going to make it a bit differently, okay?
39

39

00:01:30.933  -->  00:01:34.414
Because this is like, a whole rewrite of the entire thing...
40

40

00:01:34.414  -->  00:01:37.482
And so, we're not just tweaking some stuff here.
41

41

00:01:37.482  -->  00:01:40.661
And so, let's actually do a big media query at the end,
42

42

00:01:40.661  -->  00:01:43.053
and then copy all of that in there,
43

43

00:01:43.053  -->  00:01:46.325
and only change what we need to change, okay?
44

44

00:01:46.325  -->  00:01:49.575
So, we put a big media query down here.
45

45

00:01:50.451  -->  00:01:51.451
So, include,
46

46

00:01:52.346  -->  00:01:53.995
respond,
47

47

00:01:53.995  -->  00:01:54.932
tab,
48

48

00:01:54.932  -->  00:01:55.765
port.
49

49

00:01:58.448  -->  00:02:01.337
And now let's get this stuff here, copy it in there,
50

50

00:02:01.337  -->  00:02:04.129
and then, we're gonna remove what we don't need,
51

51

00:02:04.129  -->  00:02:06.126
which is most of it, but it's still easier
52

52

00:02:06.126  -->  00:02:07.571
to do it like this,
53

53

00:02:07.571  -->  00:02:11.167
than to copy all the things that we need.
54

54

00:02:11.167  -->  00:02:15.334
Okay, so, select it again, just so I can indent it, a bit.
55

55

00:02:16.173  -->  00:02:20.173
And where is the end of this actually? And yeah.
56

56

00:02:22.027  -->  00:02:23.955
All right. Now, we don't need any
57

57

00:02:23.955  -->  00:02:26.242
of this perspective stuff, in the position,
58

58

00:02:26.242  -->  00:02:28.027
also we don't need...
59

59

00:02:28.027  -->  00:02:30.922
But what we can change, is the height here, okay?
60

60

00:02:30.922  -->  00:02:33.247
Because remember, we set this height here,
61

61

00:02:33.247  -->  00:02:36.086
to make the front the side the same size as the back side,
62

62

00:02:36.086  -->  00:02:39.190
and also, to make the sides have the same height
63

63

00:02:39.190  -->  00:02:41.539
as the container, okay?
64

64

00:02:41.539  -->  00:02:43.153
But now, that's no longer necessary,
65

65

00:02:43.153  -->  00:02:44.937
and so, I don't want that.
66

66

00:02:44.937  -->  00:02:46.727
And so, we set it to auto, okay?
67

67

00:02:46.727  -->  00:02:49.600
So, now we override that 52, and set it to auto.
68

68

00:02:49.600  -->  00:02:53.385
It's the same thing, actually, here, on the side, okay?
69

69

00:02:53.385  -->  00:02:56.636
Now, what's also gonna happen, is that these are no longer
70

70

00:02:56.636  -->  00:02:58.851
in the absolute position, okay?
71

71

00:02:58.851  -->  00:03:00.576
So, they will now be in relative position,
72

72

00:03:00.576  -->  00:03:02.777
because we now, no longer have two sides,
73

73

00:03:02.777  -->  00:03:05.942
basically occupying the same space, okay?
74

74

00:03:05.942  -->  00:03:07.517
And so, they will not be relative.
75

75

00:03:07.517  -->  00:03:09.104
And so, first, we will have the front side,
76

76

00:03:09.104  -->  00:03:11.470
and then, after that, the back side, remember?
77

77

00:03:11.470  -->  00:03:14.653
So, we will wanna change this.
78

78

00:03:14.653  -->  00:03:18.822
We don't have to change any of this, I believe.
79

79

00:03:18.822  -->  00:03:19.774
This one should move, as well.
80

80

00:03:19.774  -->  00:03:22.243
We don't need to change any of this.
81

81

00:03:22.243  -->  00:03:26.410
Then the front part, also doesn't need any changing.
82

82

00:03:27.478  -->  00:03:30.385
And then, the back part, we don't need any of this,
83

83

00:03:30.385  -->  00:03:33.458
but what we do need, is to get rid of this transform.
84

84

00:03:33.458  -->  00:03:36.434
So, right now, the back part is rotated 180 degrees,
85

85

00:03:36.434  -->  00:03:38.815
remember, but we don't want that.
86

86

00:03:38.815  -->  00:03:41.748
So, we need to change it back to zero, right?
87

87

00:03:41.748  -->  00:03:44.831
So, let's now, take a look, actually.
88

88

00:03:46.252  -->  00:03:49.335
And well, actually, not much changed,
89

89

00:03:51.389  -->  00:03:52.639
except that the
90

90

00:03:55.385  -->  00:03:57.194
back part is completely gone.
91

91

00:03:57.194  -->  00:04:00.944
So, let's take a look at why that is happening.
92

92

00:04:00.944  -->  00:04:02.111
So, cart site,
93

93

00:04:03.414  -->  00:04:06.253
and you'll see that it, basically, doesn't have any height.
94

94

00:04:06.253  -->  00:04:08.097
So, let's see why that is happening.
95

95

00:04:08.097  -->  00:04:09.448
Well, actually the height was set to auto,
96

96

00:04:09.448  -->  00:04:12.723
so I'm not really sure what's going on here.
97

97

00:04:12.723  -->  00:04:14.251
But maybe, it has to do with the fact
98

98

00:04:14.251  -->  00:04:17.543
that this cart here is absolute.
99

99

00:04:17.543  -->  00:04:19.303
Let's take a look at that.
100

100

00:04:19.303  -->  00:04:20.983
Well, that's also not the reason.
101

101

00:04:20.983  -->  00:04:23.348
But, I'm sure it will work out a bit later,
102

102

00:04:23.348  -->  00:04:25.453
when we continue with this, okay?
103

103

00:04:25.453  -->  00:04:28.644
So, the front side, here, should not rotate, at all,
104

104

00:04:28.644  -->  00:04:30.631
when we hover it.
105

105

00:04:30.631  -->  00:04:33.442
So, set it to zero, and this, here, stays the same
106

106

00:04:33.442  -->  00:04:36.510
because the side, back, should also not rotate,
107

107

00:04:36.510  -->  00:04:38.727
and so, this is just as it was.
108

108

00:04:38.727  -->  00:04:40.810
So, we can get rid of it.
109

109

00:04:42.393  -->  00:04:44.916
All right. And now, the styling here.
110

110

00:04:44.916  -->  00:04:47.822
So, the first part, should actually stay the same.
111

111

00:04:47.822  -->  00:04:50.322
Okay, so I want this to stay exactly the same,
112

112

00:04:50.322  -->  00:04:52.163
so in the exact same style.
113

113

00:04:52.163  -->  00:04:54.579
So, very simple, just get rid of all of this.
114

114

00:04:54.579  -->  00:04:57.329
We don't want to change anything.
115

115

00:04:58.885  -->  00:05:01.635
So, all of that, let's remove it.
116

116

00:05:04.234  -->  00:05:06.204
All right. Now, here, let's set it to relative,
117

117

00:05:06.204  -->  00:05:09.696
as I did before, in the depth tools.
118

118

00:05:09.696  -->  00:05:13.178
And then, this one here, we set to zero,
119

119

00:05:13.178  -->  00:05:16.042
to zero, and we want no translate, at all,
120

120

00:05:16.042  -->  00:05:19.380
and we also want the 100% width.
121

121

00:05:19.380  -->  00:05:21.923
All right? This one we didn't change,
122

122

00:05:21.923  -->  00:05:23.217
so let's get rid of it.
123

123

00:05:23.217  -->  00:05:24.855
We don't wanna change these, as well.
124

124

00:05:24.855  -->  00:05:27.923
Maybe the margin, but first, we have to actually see it,
125

125

00:05:27.923  -->  00:05:31.401
then the price, here, we don't wanna change, at all.
126

126

00:05:31.401  -->  00:05:35.680
And then, the price value, maybe, also, the fun size.
127

127

00:05:35.680  -->  00:05:36.762
We'll see about that.
128

128

00:05:36.762  -->  00:05:38.286
Okay, but anyway, let's take a look now,
129

129

00:05:38.286  -->  00:05:40.558
and now it should somehow appear.
130

130

00:05:40.558  -->  00:05:43.233
And yeah, so here it is. Great.
131

131

00:05:43.233  -->  00:05:46.999
So, we should, probably, decrease this margin, here,
132

132

00:05:46.999  -->  00:05:49.382
then we should give this a padding here,
133

133

00:05:49.382  -->  00:05:51.390
and then use a clip path,
134

134

00:05:51.390  -->  00:05:53.306
to make it look the same way as here.
135

135

00:05:53.306  -->  00:05:55.088
So, this corner, here.
136

136

00:05:55.088  -->  00:05:57.789
So, this non-rectangular design, as I've been calling it.
137

137

00:05:57.789  -->  00:05:59.570
Okay? So, let's start with that,
138

138

00:05:59.570  -->  00:06:02.399
and remove this margin, here.
139

139

00:06:02.399  -->  00:06:03.592
So, the margin, here,
140

140

00:06:03.592  -->  00:06:07.888
let's put it to something really small like, 3 rem.
141

141

00:06:07.888  -->  00:06:10.122
Some padding in here.
142

142

00:06:10.122  -->  00:06:12.545
So, let's say padding,
143

143

00:06:12.545  -->  00:06:14.133
4 rem, and now as I was saying,
144

144

00:06:14.133  -->  00:06:15.966
let's use a clip path,
145

145

00:06:17.276  -->  00:06:19.193
here for the back side.
146

146

00:06:20.292  -->  00:06:21.440
Give it some space here,
147

147

00:06:21.440  -->  00:06:25.140
so we can nicely separate it from the rest. Okay.
148

148

00:06:25.140  -->  00:06:26.307
So, clip-path,
149

149

00:06:28.753  -->  00:06:29.586
polygon.
150

150

00:06:29.586  -->  00:06:31.804
And how should this one look like?
151

151

00:06:31.804  -->  00:06:33.276
Well, if it starts here...
152

152

00:06:33.276  -->  00:06:34.902
Okay, so it should start here,
153

153

00:06:34.902  -->  00:06:36.318
so this is the starting point.
154

154

00:06:36.318  -->  00:06:38.573
And so, this time, we don't start at zero, zero
155

155

00:06:38.573  -->  00:06:40.532
because zero, zero would be here.
156

156

00:06:40.532  -->  00:06:41.980
So, in the "X" direction...
157

157

00:06:41.980  -->  00:06:43.932
So, this way here, we still have zero,
158

158

00:06:43.932  -->  00:06:46.346
but in here, we move down a little bit.
159

159

00:06:46.346  -->  00:06:49.228
Okay? So, let's do that here.
160

160

00:06:49.228  -->  00:06:52.840
So, zero "X," and maybe 15% in "Y,"
161

161

00:06:52.840  -->  00:06:56.038
and then, the other are just regular corners.
162

162

00:06:56.038  -->  00:06:58.514
So, one of the percent, in the "X" direction.
163

163

00:06:58.514  -->  00:07:00.870
Zero, in the "Y" direction, right?
164

164

00:07:00.870  -->  00:07:04.616
But I know you're already 100% familiar with this, I'm sure.
165

165

00:07:04.616  -->  00:07:08.420
Now, the other corner is 100, 100 because it's...
166

166

00:07:08.420  -->  00:07:10.857
Just to remind you, this is 100, in the "X' direction.
167

167

00:07:10.857  -->  00:07:13.739
And 100 in the "Y" direction, right?
168

168

00:07:13.739  -->  00:07:15.778
And now, just the last part, here,
169

169

00:07:15.778  -->  00:07:19.356
so that we don't cut off all of this. Okay?
170

170

00:07:19.356  -->  00:07:23.112
So, in here, we now have zero, again, in the "X" direction,
171

171

00:07:23.112  -->  00:07:26.195
and 100, in the "Y" direction.
172

172

00:07:26.195  -->  00:07:28.028
And that should do it.
173

173

00:07:28.997  -->  00:07:31.709
All right. Now, one thing is that,
174

174

00:07:31.709  -->  00:07:33.601
of course, here, don't have enough margin,
175

175

00:07:33.601  -->  00:07:36.698
but the bigger problem is these rounded corners,
176

176

00:07:36.698  -->  00:07:38.468
that we have here,
177

177

00:07:38.468  -->  00:07:40.063
but then we also want to entire element
178

178

00:07:40.063  -->  00:07:43.370
to have a wide background, okay?
179

179

00:07:43.370  -->  00:07:46.593
Plus, this shadow, here, is not only on the front side,
180

180

00:07:46.593  -->  00:07:48.956
and it should be on the entire thing.
181

181

00:07:48.956  -->  00:07:52.126
So, three things that have to change now.
182

182

00:07:52.126  -->  00:07:54.679
Let's do it, so starting with the border radius,
183

183

00:07:54.679  -->  00:07:57.247
let's remove it from here, we can put it here,
184

184

00:07:57.247  -->  00:07:59.047
on this element.
185

185

00:07:59.047  -->  00:08:01.069
So, basically, the container element,
186

186

00:08:01.069  -->  00:08:02.498
the cart element, itself.
187

187

00:08:02.498  -->  00:08:06.665
Then, also, we want the background color to be white.
188

188

00:08:07.796  -->  00:08:10.905
Color, white. So, that should fix it.
189

189

00:08:10.905  -->  00:08:11.738
And now,
190

190

00:08:11.738  -->  00:08:14.321
the shadow, that we had before,
191

191

00:08:15.405  -->  00:08:17.322
let me see where it is.
192

192

00:08:18.393  -->  00:08:21.169
And so, yeah, it was here, on the side,
193

193

00:08:21.169  -->  00:08:22.514
but we no longer want it on the side,
194

194

00:08:22.514  -->  00:08:24.665
we want it on the entire cart element.
195

195

00:08:24.665  -->  00:08:27.498
Right? So, we need to change that.
196

196

00:08:29.505  -->  00:08:32.401
So, the box shadow, that was here,
197

197

00:08:32.401  -->  00:08:34.338
we had to remove it, set it to none,
198

198

00:08:34.338  -->  00:08:37.338
and then, put it, here, on the cart.
199

199

00:08:38.251  -->  00:08:41.228
All right? And now, just for this padding, here.
200

200

00:08:41.228  -->  00:08:42.791
It took me a bit more, at the top,
201

201

00:08:42.791  -->  00:08:46.111
so let's say, seven rem, at the top,
202

202

00:08:46.111  -->  00:08:48.101
four on the right, and then,
203

203

00:08:48.101  -->  00:08:50.934
four on all the other sides, okay?
204

204

00:08:51.832  -->  00:08:54.929
So, let's take a look at this, now.
205

205

00:08:54.929  -->  00:08:58.682
And, all right, that looks pretty good to me, actually.
206

206

00:08:58.682  -->  00:09:01.493
Let's try to decrease it a bit,
207

207

00:09:01.493  -->  00:09:04.575
and yeah, that continues looking great, right?
208

208

00:09:04.575  -->  00:09:06.133
Maybe we can decrease some padding here.
209

209

00:09:06.133  -->  00:09:07.633
Let's take a look.
210

210

00:09:09.554  -->  00:09:10.941
So, we have three rem here,
211

211

00:09:10.941  -->  00:09:13.068
so let's schedule it off that.
212

212

00:09:13.068  -->  00:09:14.996
Let's actually copy it from here,
213

213

00:09:14.996  -->  00:09:18.077
since that we already have it.
214

214

00:09:18.077  -->  00:09:18.910
So,
215

215

00:09:21.528  -->  00:09:23.028
Whoa, what's that?
216

216

00:09:26.167  -->  00:09:27.917
What's going on here?
217

217

00:09:29.093  -->  00:09:31.760
So, I closed this, accidentally,
218

218

00:09:33.089  -->  00:09:35.672
All right, so just cart details.
219

219

00:09:35.672  -->  00:09:37.736
Okay, I shouldn't have done this, I guess.
220

220

00:09:37.736  -->  00:09:40.773
It would be easier to just have written it out.
221

221

00:09:40.773  -->  00:09:43.548
So, padding at the top, let's put it at zero,
222

222

00:09:43.548  -->  00:09:46.157
and then, on the side, only three rem.
223

223

00:09:46.157  -->  00:09:48.152
So, how does that look like?
224

224

00:09:48.152  -->  00:09:51.434
Well, then maybe one rem's better,
225

225

00:09:51.434  -->  00:09:54.184
but that should be it, all right?
226

226

00:09:56.803  -->  00:10:00.970
So that are the carts. Looks pretty good now, I think.
227

227

00:10:02.095  -->  00:10:05.153
And yeah. Maybe just decreasing this font size, here,
228

228

00:10:05.153  -->  00:10:08.136
but that's, also, pretty easy.
229

229

00:10:08.136  -->  00:10:08.969
For rem.
230

230

00:10:09.927  -->  00:10:10.760
All right?
231

231

00:10:10.760  -->  00:10:12.927
So, next up, we have this,
232

232

00:10:15.106  -->  00:10:16.535
this story section here,
233

233

00:10:16.535  -->  00:10:18.278
and this looks a bit weird, as well.
234

234

00:10:18.278  -->  00:10:19.814
So, let's get rid of these problems.
235

235

00:10:19.814  -->  00:10:23.530
For starters, let's make this, here, a square again,
236

236

00:10:23.530  -->  00:10:26.227
so that it can really fit more text,
237

237

00:10:26.227  -->  00:10:29.116
and so that we don't waste all of the white space
238

238

00:10:29.116  -->  00:10:30.838
that we have, here on the sides. Okay?
239

239

00:10:30.838  -->  00:10:32.648
It's a big waste of space, and we don't need that
240

240

00:10:32.648  -->  00:10:34.398
on this small screen.
241

241

00:10:35.461  -->  00:10:40.137
So, it is the story component, and so, let's check it out.
242

242

00:10:40.137  -->  00:10:41.304
All right? So,
243

243

00:10:42.696  -->  00:10:43.529
include,
244

244

00:10:44.935  -->  00:10:45.768
respond
245

245

00:10:45.768  -->  00:10:49.768
Once again, let's do it for the tablet portrait.
246

246

00:10:51.305  -->  00:10:55.305
And starting to increase in width, to 100%.
247

247

00:10:57.291  -->  00:10:58.795
That should help, already.
248

248

00:10:58.795  -->  00:11:00.545
So, just take a look,
249

249

00:11:01.740  -->  00:11:02.573
and
250

250

00:11:04.040  -->  00:11:06.290
so we start here, and yeah.
251

251

00:11:07.590  -->  00:11:11.040
Well, that's not really correct.
252

252

00:11:11.040  -->  00:11:12.873
It should be 90%.
253

253

00:11:14.252  -->  00:11:17.146
Is it 90%, actually? Let's take a look.
254

254

00:11:17.146  -->  00:11:17.979
Inspect.
255

255

00:11:19.890  -->  00:11:21.997
Oh, okay, this is happening because of the row.
256

256

00:11:21.997  -->  00:11:25.914
Okay, so they're always taking away that space.
257

257

00:11:28.449  -->  00:11:31.150
But it still looks okay, I believe, actually.
258

258

00:11:31.150  -->  00:11:32.670
All the way until 600.
259

259

00:11:32.670  -->  00:11:35.528
So, at 600, is when we should actually
260

260

00:11:35.528  -->  00:11:37.490
start to change things here
261

261

00:11:37.490  -->  00:11:39.522
because up until point, it's still okay.
262

262

00:11:39.522  -->  00:11:41.211
So, let's just remove some padding, here, from this,
263

263

00:11:41.211  -->  00:11:44.782
and then, we can move on to the phone media query, okay?
264

264

00:11:44.782  -->  00:11:47.563
So, the padding that we have currently is...
265

265

00:11:47.563  -->  00:11:48.852
Where is it?
266

266

00:11:48.852  -->  00:11:53.211
Six and nine. So, we can decrease these values a bit,
267

267

00:11:53.211  -->  00:11:54.310
to say
268

268

00:11:54.310  -->  00:11:55.178
four
269

269

00:11:55.178  -->  00:11:56.078
and
270

270

00:11:56.078  -->  00:11:56.911
seven.
271

271

00:11:56.911  -->  00:12:00.866
So, decreasing them both, by two rems.
272

272

00:12:00.866  -->  00:12:04.484
And yeah, so now we have some more breathing space in here.
273

273

00:12:04.484  -->  00:12:06.058
Okay?
274

274

00:12:06.058  -->  00:12:09.391
And now, at 600 pixels, so at the phone,
275

275

00:12:10.553  -->  00:12:12.803
let's do some more changes.
276

276

00:12:18.588  -->  00:12:22.584
So, for the phone, we want to get rid of this completely.
277

277

00:12:22.584  -->  00:12:24.792
Sawed off this weird shape.
278

278

00:12:24.792  -->  00:12:28.375
So, set it to zero, and then the same thing
279

279

00:12:29.577  -->  00:12:31.956
for the shape, of course.
280

280

00:12:31.956  -->  00:12:36.123
Because right now, it has 12 degrees to compensate for.
281

281

00:12:37.339  -->  00:12:39.056
The skewing that we did there.
282

282

00:12:39.056  -->  00:12:41.845
Now, we actually also have to copy this one here.
283

283

00:12:41.845  -->  00:12:43.990
Remember that it's the exact same thing.
284

284

00:12:43.990  -->  00:12:47.515
So, this transformer has to have the translate and askew,
285

285

00:12:47.515  -->  00:12:48.889
just like this one.
286

286

00:12:48.889  -->  00:12:50.373
But a translate is still okay,
287

287

00:12:50.373  -->  00:12:52.245
but what we need to change is the school,
288

288

00:12:52.245  -->  00:12:54.895
from 12 to zero, right?
289

289

00:12:54.895  -->  00:12:59.188
And then, there should be another one, somewhere,
290

290

00:12:59.188  -->  00:13:02.271
and where is it? Oh yeah, right here.
291

291

00:13:05.096  -->  00:13:07.679
Well, that's not what I wanted.
292

292

00:13:10.525  -->  00:13:11.358
All right.
293

293

00:13:12.502  -->  00:13:15.252
So, that gets rid of the skewing.
294

294

00:13:16.135  -->  00:13:16.968
So,
295

295

00:13:18.523  -->  00:13:21.053
all right. That's better, actually.
296

296

00:13:21.053  -->  00:13:22.446
All right? So, this looks okay
297

297

00:13:22.446  -->  00:13:25.461
on all of these screen sizes here.
298

298

00:13:25.461  -->  00:13:27.510
So, I'm pretty happy with this one.
299

299

00:13:27.510  -->  00:13:29.010
So, let's move on.
300

300

00:13:30.703  -->  00:13:33.621
And this one here, to be honest, looks terrible, right?
301

301

00:13:33.621  -->  00:13:36.127
But it shouldn't be all too hard to fix.
302

302

00:13:36.127  -->  00:13:39.109
So, let's, very quickly, do that, as well.
303

303

00:13:39.109  -->  00:13:43.365
So, the first part, is here in the home, remember?
304

304

00:13:43.365  -->  00:13:45.724
So, down here, in this book section,
305

305

00:13:45.724  -->  00:13:50.535
is where most of the layout actually happens, okay?
306

306

00:13:50.535  -->  00:13:51.368
So, let's
307

307

00:13:52.305  -->  00:13:53.138
include
308

308

00:13:54.214  -->  00:13:56.464
our makes in here. Respond.
309

309

00:13:58.155  -->  00:13:59.646
Then, let's actually take a look,
310

310

00:13:59.646  -->  00:14:02.896
and where this starts to look that bad.
311

311

00:14:05.304  -->  00:14:08.325
It's kind of still acceptable, right?
312

312

00:14:08.325  -->  00:14:11.409
But then it starts to look really bad,
313

313

00:14:11.409  -->  00:14:13.826
and well, we should fix that.
314

314

00:14:14.965  -->  00:14:16.832
Even at this media query, here.
315

315

00:14:16.832  -->  00:14:19.018
So, the tablet's landscape.
316

316

00:14:19.018  -->  00:14:19.851
So, tab,
317

317

00:14:21.159  -->  00:14:21.992
land.
318

318

00:14:24.485  -->  00:14:26.299
And the main thing that we need to change,
319

319

00:14:26.299  -->  00:14:27.714
is actually
320

320

00:14:27.714  -->  00:14:28.780
this gradient here.
321

321

00:14:28.780  -->  00:14:31.174
And what we can do, for starters,
322

322

00:14:31.174  -->  00:14:33.570
is to simply set this to 70, 70,
323

323

00:14:33.570  -->  00:14:36.320
and then, also, setting the width
324

324

00:14:38.822  -->  00:14:41.620
off this box, where the form is in,
325

325

00:14:41.620  -->  00:14:45.787
also to 70%, and that should already increase it,
326

326

00:14:46.694  -->  00:14:48.861
and improve the situation.
327

327

00:14:51.239  -->  00:14:52.072
Okay?
328

328

00:14:52.072  -->  00:14:54.619
Now, one thing , that we actually skipped
329

329

00:14:54.619  -->  00:14:58.236
when we designed this cart, was this height, here, okay?
330

330

00:14:58.236  -->  00:15:01.248
So, we should have removed that, but I totally forgot.
331

331

00:15:01.248  -->  00:15:02.651
So let's do it now, okay?
332

332

00:15:02.651  -->  00:15:04.479
Don't forget to remove that height.
333

333

00:15:04.479  -->  00:15:06.487
That was just for testing purposes,
334

334

00:15:06.487  -->  00:15:09.859
but for some reason I then left it there, accidentally.
335

335

00:15:09.859  -->  00:15:11.338
So, let's take a look.
336

336

00:15:11.338  -->  00:15:12.171
So, 1,210.
337

337

00:15:13.066  -->  00:15:16.554
All right, so that' s better, to be honest.
338

338

00:15:16.554  -->  00:15:20.639
And now, as we approach the 900 media query.
339

339

00:15:20.639  -->  00:15:21.472
Okay?
340

340

00:15:21.472  -->  00:15:23.612
Actually, this image here, is starting to,
341

341

00:15:23.612  -->  00:15:24.960
already, look a bit weird.
342

342

00:15:24.960  -->  00:15:26.314
So, we should fix that,
343

343

00:15:26.314  -->  00:15:27.627
and I'm gonna show you how.
344

344

00:15:27.627  -->  00:15:30.419
So, what we'll do here, is to basically make this image
345

345

00:15:30.419  -->  00:15:34.782
occupying the entire height, and not the entire width,
346

346

00:15:34.782  -->  00:15:36.724
as it's doing right now, okay?
347

347

00:15:36.724  -->  00:15:39.737
So, why is it occupying the entire width, right now?
348

348

00:15:39.737  -->  00:15:42.686
Well, that's because of background size, 100%.
349

349

00:15:42.686  -->  00:15:45.950
Remember, this is similar, to background cover,
350

350

00:15:45.950  -->  00:15:47.050
but it's not really the same
351

351

00:15:47.050  -->  00:15:48.971
because what this does, is ensure
352

352

00:15:48.971  -->  00:15:50.754
that the image fits the container,
353

353

00:15:50.754  -->  00:15:53.303
in the "X" direction, basically.
354

354

00:15:53.303  -->  00:15:58.063
Okay? But what we want right now, is really the cover, okay?
355

355

00:15:58.063  -->  00:16:00.146
So, I'm gonna change that
356

356

00:16:01.329  -->  00:16:03.746
to background size, actually,
357

357

00:16:05.492  -->  00:16:06.560
and cover.
358

358

00:16:06.560  -->  00:16:10.040
And, actually, I think that 70 is a bit too much here.
359

359

00:16:10.040  -->  00:16:13.790
SO, 65, 65, and then, down here, as well, 65.
360

360

00:16:20.625  -->  00:16:24.046
And now, it behaves, just as we wanted.
361

361

00:16:24.046  -->  00:16:26.756
Okay? So, covering the entire element.
362

362

00:16:26.756  -->  00:16:29.559
Okay, and now, starting from 900,
363

363

00:16:29.559  -->  00:16:31.559
so from the tablet size,
364

364

00:16:33.206  -->  00:16:35.710
we need to do some more changes.
365

365

00:16:35.710  -->  00:16:37.014
So, respond,
366

366

00:16:37.014  -->  00:16:37.847
tab,
367

367

00:16:39.222  -->  00:16:40.055
port.
368

368

00:16:44.745  -->  00:16:48.093
Okay. So this background image, here,
369

369

00:16:48.093  -->  00:16:50.219
is what needs to change, of course.
370

370

00:16:50.219  -->  00:16:52.483
Now, we don't want this 105 degrees here.
371

371

00:16:52.483  -->  00:16:54.150
We don't care, at all, about that.
372

372

00:16:54.150  -->  00:16:56.827
Let's just put any direction; it doesn't really matter.
373

373

00:16:56.827  -->  00:16:57.994
So, two right,
374

374

00:16:59.167  -->  00:17:00.000
okay?
375

375

00:17:00.000  -->  00:17:03.500
And now, starting from zero, to 100%,
376

376

00:17:04.512  -->  00:17:05.941
and no transparent, at all.
377

377

00:17:05.941  -->  00:17:09.009
So, it will all be covered in white now. Okay?
378

378

00:17:09.009  -->  00:17:11.753
That's what we really want.
379

379

00:17:11.753  -->  00:17:13.866
And then width in here
380

380

00:17:13.866  -->  00:17:14.699
should be...
381

381

00:17:14.699  -->  00:17:16.782
Let's actually copy this.
382

382

00:17:19.334  -->  00:17:23.167
So, port, and now we want the 100% width.
383

383

00:17:24.914  -->  00:17:25.747
All right.
384

384

00:17:31.135  -->  00:17:32.408
And so, that looks pretty good.
385

385

00:17:32.408  -->  00:17:34.689
Not perfect here, so there some more stuff
386

386

00:17:34.689  -->  00:17:36.345
that we can fix, of course.
387

387

00:17:36.345  -->  00:17:38.345
So, let's do that, as well,
388

388

00:17:38.345  -->  00:17:41.180
but for this part, here, we're good.
389

389

00:17:41.180  -->  00:17:43.991
And so, let's now go to the form.
390

390

00:17:43.991  -->  00:17:45.961
So, what can we fix? And the firs thing
391

391

00:17:45.961  -->  00:17:50.405
that came to my mind was to fix this radio group.
392

392

00:17:50.405  -->  00:17:51.405
So, include,
393

393

00:17:55.603  -->  00:17:56.609
respond,
394

394

00:17:56.609  -->  00:17:57.442
tab, port
395

395

00:18:00.616  -->  00:18:03.283
and set it's width to 100%,
396

396

00:18:04.840  -->  00:18:06.148
and maybe a margin to the bottom.
397

397

00:18:06.148  -->  00:18:09.920
Because otherwise, it will be one on top of another.
398

398

00:18:09.920  -->  00:18:10.753
And so,
399

399

00:18:12.072  -->  00:18:12.905
yeah.
400

400

00:18:12.905  -->  00:18:14.880
That's better.
401

401

00:18:14.880  -->  00:18:16.880
Give it some more space,
402

402

00:18:17.927  -->  00:18:19.958
and now, this looks like a real form, to me.
403

403

00:18:19.958  -->  00:18:22.764
Also, I think there's something going on, with this here.
404

404

00:18:22.764  -->  00:18:25.955
I think it's 90% width only.
405

405

00:18:25.955  -->  00:18:29.372
If I am not mistaken, so let's copy this.
406

406

00:18:32.259  -->  00:18:34.174
Yeah, that's right.
407

407

00:18:34.174  -->  00:18:36.007
So, let's change that,
408

408

00:18:37.477  -->  00:18:39.060
to width 100%,
409

409

00:18:40.366  -->  00:18:41.616
and here we go.
410

410

00:18:45.311  -->  00:18:48.773
So, this looks pretty good to me.
411

411

00:18:48.773  -->  00:18:49.663
It's not perfect,
412

412

00:18:49.663  -->  00:18:51.283
as I was saying, in the beginning.
413

413

00:18:51.283  -->  00:18:53.729
But I don't wanna worry all too much about this.
414

414

00:18:53.729  -->  00:18:55.988
I don't want to make it 100% perfect,
415

415

00:18:55.988  -->  00:18:57.865
because this was just to demonstrate to you,
416

416

00:18:57.865  -->  00:19:00.721
how we actually work with media queries.
417

417

00:19:00.721  -->  00:19:03.623
So, I now encourage you to keep working at this,
418

418

00:19:03.623  -->  00:19:06.497
to make it really perfect, to change every single detail
419

419

00:19:06.497  -->  00:19:07.636
that could be better.
420

420

00:19:07.636  -->  00:19:11.338
I also want you to test this on real devices, if you can.
421

421

00:19:11.338  -->  00:19:14.516
And there's also a cool app, that you can test.
422

422

00:19:14.516  -->  00:19:17.266
Which is called Sizzy, I believe.
423

423

00:19:18.449  -->  00:19:19.782
Okay.
424

424

00:19:19.782  -->  00:19:21.399
And if you have your page online somewhere,
425

425

00:19:21.399  -->  00:19:23.447
then you can just enter your URL here,
426

426

00:19:23.447  -->  00:19:24.827
and then it will show you the page
427

427

00:19:24.827  -->  00:19:26.697
on a lot of different devices.
428

428

00:19:26.697  -->  00:19:30.523
You can just load this example here.
429

429

00:19:30.523  -->  00:19:31.478
So, this is how it looks like.
430

430

00:19:31.478  -->  00:19:33.532
So, you have this page on all these different devices here,
431

431

00:19:33.532  -->  00:19:34.997
at the same time,
432

432

00:19:34.997  -->  00:19:39.278
and you can check it out, how it looks on all of them.
433

433

00:19:39.278  -->  00:19:40.854
Sizzy is how it's called.
434

434

00:19:40.854  -->  00:19:44.354
I'll also put a link on my resources page.
435

435

00:19:45.271  -->  00:19:46.104
All right.
436

436

00:19:46.104  -->  00:19:47.433
And I have one last challenge for you,
437

437

00:19:47.433  -->  00:19:51.615
which is actually, when you hit this button, here.
438

438

00:19:51.615  -->  00:19:53.904
So, this is right now, the pop up,
439

439

00:19:53.904  -->  00:19:56.076
and I'm not going to change it because I want this
440

440

00:19:56.076  -->  00:19:58.157
to be a challenge for you.
441

441

00:19:58.157  -->  00:20:00.569
So, before moving on, get your hands dirty
442

442

00:20:00.569  -->  00:20:02.677
with this part here, of the website,
443

443

00:20:02.677  -->  00:20:04.732
and make it completely responsive.
444

444

00:20:04.732  -->  00:20:07.095
You can put the images here, on top, for example,
445

445

00:20:07.095  -->  00:20:08.197
or you can put them at the bottom.
446

446

00:20:08.197  -->  00:20:10.135
Whatever you like. You're completely free
447

447

00:20:10.135  -->  00:20:12.115
to do it as your wish. Okay?
448

448

00:20:12.115  -->  00:20:14.894
So, that's my challenge for you,
449

449

00:20:14.894  -->  00:20:16.598
and after that, we're gonna move on
450

450

00:20:16.598  -->  00:20:18.537
to responsive images.
451

451

00:20:18.537  -->  00:20:20.555
Okay, so good luck with that challenge,
