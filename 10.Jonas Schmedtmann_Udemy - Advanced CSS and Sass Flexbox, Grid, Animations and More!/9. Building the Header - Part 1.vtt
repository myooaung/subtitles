<v ->Welcome back.</v>
2

2

00:00:02.478  -->  00:00:05.554
In this lecture, and the next one, we're going to build
3

3

00:00:05.554  -->  00:00:07.528
the header part of the app.
4

4

00:00:07.528  -->  00:00:10.930
And that will include using SVG images as icons,
5

5

00:00:10.930  -->  00:00:13.275
instead of an icon font.
6

6

00:00:13.275  -->  00:00:16.549
So you're gonna learn what SVG's actually are,
7

7

00:00:16.549  -->  00:00:21.077
how to find, generate, and use SVG's sprites in HTML,
8

8

00:00:21.077  -->  00:00:24.804
how to change the color of an SVG image in CSS,
9

9

00:00:24.804  -->  00:00:28.217
and finally, you will learn more advanced flexbox
10

10

00:00:28.217  -->  00:00:30.551
alignment techniques, which we're gonna need to
11

11

00:00:30.551  -->  00:00:33.884
layout all the components in the header.
12

12

00:00:34.823  -->  00:00:38.271
So in our header, we basically have three main components:
13

13

00:00:38.271  -->  00:00:40.907
we have the logo here, then we have the
14

14

00:00:40.907  -->  00:00:45.423
search bar with this input field here and this icon,
15

15

00:00:45.423  -->  00:00:47.594
then on the right side we have something that I call the
16

16

00:00:47.594  -->  00:00:49.034
user navigation.
17

17

00:00:49.034  -->  00:00:52.354
So we have like bookmarks, a chat functionality,
18

18

00:00:52.354  -->  00:00:54.606
and the name of the user.
19

19

00:00:54.606  -->  00:00:57.033
Okay, so these three are the main components:
20

20

00:00:57.033  -->  00:01:00.200
logo, search bar, and user navigation.
21

21

00:01:01.236  -->  00:01:04.521
So let's mark it up in our HTML right now.
22

22

00:01:04.521  -->  00:01:05.604
So, 'Header.'
23

23

00:01:07.563  -->  00:01:11.730
And we start with the image, which I simply call 'logo.'
24

24

00:01:12.602  -->  00:01:15.551
And the source for this one is an 'IMG' folder,
25

25

00:01:15.551  -->  00:01:17.634
and simply called 'logo.'
26

26

00:01:19.266  -->  00:01:23.666
And for the description I just use "trillo logo."
27

27

00:01:23.666  -->  00:01:26.000
Alright, so that's the first part.
28

28

00:01:26.000  -->  00:01:28.821
Next we have a search bar and for that I'm using a
29

29

00:01:28.821  -->  00:01:30.404
form element, okay?
30

30

00:01:31.526  -->  00:01:35.485
And the action is just the hash symbol, so nothing happens.
31

31

00:01:35.485  -->  00:01:37.985
Now in here you want an input,
32

32

00:01:40.269  -->  00:01:42.532
which is called 'search input.'
33

33

00:01:42.532  -->  00:01:46.561
And as you see, once again I'm using the BEM notation here,
34

34

00:01:46.561  -->  00:01:49.684
so search is my block and to add the element is the
35

35

00:01:49.684  -->  00:01:53.267
input separated with these two underscores.
36

36

00:01:54.723  -->  00:01:58.334
Now we also have the placeholder here which says
37

37

00:01:58.334  -->  00:02:00.911
'Search Hotels', okay.
38

38

00:02:00.911  -->  00:02:05.078
And then the button, this one is called 'search button.'
39

39

00:02:10.861  -->  00:02:13.496
Now remember that in here in the button,
40

40

00:02:13.496  -->  00:02:16.782
we actually had this little icon, this magnifying glass,
41

41

00:02:16.782  -->  00:02:18.153
this icon here.
42

42

00:02:18.153  -->  00:02:20.520
So in the last Natures project that we built,
43

43

00:02:20.520  -->  00:02:23.138
and maybe in your projects that you've built yourself,
44

44

00:02:23.138  -->  00:02:25.878
we've been using icon fonts, right?
45

45

00:02:25.878  -->  00:02:27.979
But this time we're gonna do it differently,
46

46

00:02:27.979  -->  00:02:30.896
and we're gonna use SVG's as icons.
47

47

00:02:32.031  -->  00:02:33.865
Now why are we actually moving
48

48

00:02:33.865  -->  00:02:35.827
away from icon fonts to SVG's?
49

49

00:02:35.827  -->  00:02:38.451
Well, there are several problems with icon fonts,
50

50

00:02:38.451  -->  00:02:42.491
like the fact that it's really just a hack to display icons,
51

51

00:02:42.491  -->  00:02:45.406
which are like images using a font.
52

52

00:02:45.406  -->  00:02:48.482
Also, icon fonts fail more often than you would think,
53

53

00:02:48.482  -->  00:02:51.985
and in that case, the browser just displays a blank square
54

54

00:02:51.985  -->  00:02:54.110
or something like that on the screen
55

55

00:02:54.110  -->  00:02:55.712
and that's really terrible.
56

56

00:02:55.712  -->  00:02:57.349
And there are actually other issues,
57

57

00:02:57.349  -->  00:03:00.553
like screenreaders for blind people trying to read
58

58

00:03:00.553  -->  00:03:05.383
out the icon fonts and of course, failing to do so.
59

59

00:03:05.383  -->  00:03:08.018
And because of all that, right now it's actually considered
60

60

00:03:08.018  -->  00:03:10.805
a best practice to move away from icon fonts
61

61

00:03:10.805  -->  00:03:13.626
and to move to a better alternative.
62

62

00:03:13.626  -->  00:03:16.412
And that better alternative is of course, SVG.
63

63

00:03:16.412  -->  00:03:19.106
Now what is SVG, actually?
64

64

00:03:19.106  -->  00:03:22.716
Well, SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics,
65

65

00:03:22.716  -->  00:03:24.760
and it's just basically a way of
66

66

00:03:24.760  -->  00:03:27.233
writing vector graphics with code.
67

67

00:03:27.233  -->  00:03:29.973
But don't worry, we're not going to write any
68

68

00:03:29.973  -->  00:03:32.666
SVG code here for icons, okay?
69

69

00:03:32.666  -->  00:03:36.741
Instead, we're gonna use a great app called 'IcoMoon.'
70

70

00:03:36.741  -->  00:03:39.991
And so let's open that one, IcoMoon.io.
71

71

00:03:43.255  -->  00:03:46.262
And this is just really a simple web app.
72

72

00:03:46.262  -->  00:03:50.429
So let's move here to where it says 'IcoMoon App.'
73

73

00:03:51.614  -->  00:03:53.669
So here in the IcoMoon App,
74

74

00:03:53.669  -->  00:03:56.385
you can upload an icon font if you want.
75

75

00:03:56.385  -->  00:03:58.301
For example here, so if you have an icon font
76

76

00:03:58.301  -->  00:04:01.749
on your computer and want to convert it to SVG's,
77

77

00:04:01.749  -->  00:04:04.675
then you can do it in here, okay.
78

78

00:04:04.675  -->  00:04:08.158
But what's even better, is that we can select icons
79

79

00:04:08.158  -->  00:04:12.158
from their free library, okay, so let's do that.
80

80

00:04:13.649  -->  00:04:16.099
So if you come down here,
81

81

00:04:16.099  -->  00:04:18.479
you have 'Add Icons from the Library,'
82

82

00:04:18.479  -->  00:04:20.743
then you have all of these free libraries
83

83

00:04:20.743  -->  00:04:22.810
with these free icons, okay.
84

84

00:04:22.810  -->  00:04:24.783
So you can take a look at all of these,
85

85

00:04:24.783  -->  00:04:29.184
and the ones that I'm choosing are called 'Entypo.'
86

86

00:04:29.184  -->  00:04:31.691
Okay, so 'Entypo +' because I really like these
87

87

00:04:31.691  -->  00:04:34.687
and I think they look great on our app.
88

88

00:04:34.687  -->  00:04:36.823
So we just hit 'add' and then from here,
89

89

00:04:36.823  -->  00:04:40.945
we just need to select the icons that we actually want.
90

90

00:04:40.945  -->  00:04:43.534
And if you take a look at this finished app,
91

91

00:04:43.534  -->  00:04:45.739
we see that we actually need 10 icons,
92

92

00:04:45.739  -->  00:04:48.816
so these four icons here, then the star,
93

93

00:04:48.816  -->  00:04:53.100
then this bookmark, this chat, this location pin,
94

94

00:04:53.100  -->  00:04:57.267
this list item icon here, and then finally of course,
95

95

00:04:58.290  -->  00:05:02.249
the magnifying glass, which is the one we're gonna use next.
96

96

00:05:02.249  -->  00:05:05.976
So these 10 icons are the ones we need to select,
97

97

00:05:05.976  -->  00:05:09.393
and so here is one, here is the next one,
98

98

00:05:11.676  -->  00:05:15.624
then here is the plane, here is the chat,
99

99

00:05:15.624  -->  00:05:19.791
down here we have the house, and also the key down here,
100

100

00:05:21.568  -->  00:05:25.620
let's add the location, then here's the magnifying glass,
101

101

00:05:25.620  -->  00:05:28.953
the map, and finally the star down here.
102

102

00:05:29.985  -->  00:05:32.528
Okay, so we have our 10 icons selected,
103

103

00:05:32.528  -->  00:05:34.594
you can see it here we have 10, okay.
104

104

00:05:34.594  -->  00:05:38.170
Now if you wanted other icons or more icons,
105

105

00:05:38.170  -->  00:05:40.968
you could of course select as many as you wished, okay.
106

106

00:05:40.968  -->  00:05:43.395
So all we have to do now is to come here,
107

107

00:05:43.395  -->  00:05:45.275
'Generate SVG and More',
108

108

00:05:45.275  -->  00:05:48.224
then we see our 10 icons we selected,
109

109

00:05:48.224  -->  00:05:50.070
then we hit here the 'Settings',
110

110

00:05:50.070  -->  00:05:52.253
okay, and then we see there will be a class prefix
111

111

00:05:52.253  -->  00:05:56.723
called 'icon' and actually we don't want any PNG's,
112

112

00:05:56.723  -->  00:05:58.806
we just want SVG's, okay.
113

113

00:05:59.811  -->  00:06:02.725
So it says SVG here now, and now we can hit 'Download'
114

114

00:06:02.725  -->  00:06:03.975
and open it up.
115

115

00:06:05.187  -->  00:06:06.545
So when you open this folder,
116

116

00:06:06.545  -->  00:06:10.457
it gives you all this stuff here which you really don't use.
117

117

00:06:10.457  -->  00:06:13.685
So all we need are these SVG files here,
118

118

00:06:13.685  -->  00:06:16.518
and even more importantly, this file here.
119

119

00:06:16.518  -->  00:06:20.558
So 'symbol-defs' and this is a so-called sprite file.
120

120

00:06:20.558  -->  00:06:22.195
So what is a sprite file?
121

121

00:06:22.195  -->  00:06:25.806
Well, it's simply an SVG file which contains all of these
122

122

00:06:25.806  -->  00:06:27.973
10 SVG images in it, okay,
123

123

00:06:29.614  -->  00:06:31.785
and that's the one we're actually gonna use,
124

124

00:06:31.785  -->  00:06:34.571
because this way, we only have to use one global file,
125

125

00:06:34.571  -->  00:06:36.638
which is just this one here,
126

126

00:06:36.638  -->  00:06:39.552
and from there we can select each of the icons.
127

127

00:06:39.552  -->  00:06:41.770
And so this way, we only have one 'http' request
128

128

00:06:41.770  -->  00:06:45.125
for one file instead of having to include all of these
129

129

00:06:45.125  -->  00:06:46.808
10 different files.
130

130

00:06:46.808  -->  00:06:49.641
So icon sprites, like this one here is the way to go,
131

131

00:06:49.641  -->  00:06:52.346
and that's how all the professionals do it.
132

132

00:06:52.346  -->  00:06:55.051
Also we have this html file here,
133

133

00:06:55.051  -->  00:06:59.115
what this does so that we can see the names of the icons,
134

134

00:06:59.115  -->  00:07:02.644
and actually this is not the right one,
135

135

00:07:02.644  -->  00:07:05.082
the one that we need is just 'demo.'
136

136

00:07:05.082  -->  00:07:07.300
So these are the names of the icons
137

137

00:07:07.300  -->  00:07:09.924
that we can now use in html,
138

138

00:07:09.924  -->  00:07:12.582
so first let's get more icons here.
139

139

00:07:12.582  -->  00:07:16.332
So this entire folder and then this one here,
140

140

00:07:16.332  -->  00:07:19.200
and I'm going to copy it to the project folder,
141

141

00:07:19.200  -->  00:07:23.763
so trillo, img, and then I'm pasting it in here.
142

142

00:07:23.763  -->  00:07:26.108
Alright, here we go.
143

143

00:07:26.108  -->  00:07:28.407
Now I'm going to call this one 'sprite,'
144

144

00:07:28.407  -->  00:07:29.510
and I actually already have one sprite,
145

145

00:07:29.510  -->  00:07:33.213
because I included it here, because I already had it.
146

146

00:07:33.213  -->  00:07:37.380
So I'm gonna delete it, and call this one 'sprite.'
147

147

00:07:38.508  -->  00:07:40.655
So you should also delete the sprite file that you
148

148

00:07:40.655  -->  00:07:43.523
already had, and then change this one here to 'sprite.'
149

149

00:07:43.523  -->  00:07:45.648
And so that's the one that we're gonna use.
150

150

00:07:45.648  -->  00:07:48.898
I'm also leaving this folder here with these initial files,
151

151

00:07:48.898  -->  00:07:52.753
because we're gonna need maybe one of them later.
152

152

00:07:52.753  -->  00:07:54.100
So, and with this, you are ready
153

153

00:07:54.100  -->  00:07:56.600
to use this 'sprite' SVG file.
154

154

00:07:58.407  -->  00:08:01.971
So, let's go back to our code editor here and include it.
155

155

00:08:01.971  -->  00:08:05.315
Now, how do we actually do that in HTML?
156

156

00:08:05.315  -->  00:08:08.972
Well, we use the SVG element which I'm gonna call
157

157

00:08:08.972  -->  00:08:10.139
'search icon'.
158

158

00:08:15.485  -->  00:08:19.514
Then in here we have to use something called 'use.'
159

159

00:08:19.514  -->  00:08:24.019
So 'use' and then an attribute called 'xlink',
160

160

00:08:24.019  -->  00:08:28.372
colon, 'href', so that sounds a bit strange,
161

161

00:08:28.372  -->  00:08:31.612
but that's just how we can include the SVG file
162

162

00:08:31.612  -->  00:08:35.640
and then reference each separate icon in there.
163

163

00:08:35.640  -->  00:08:39.807
So, 'IMG', 'sprite.svg', and that's the name of the
164

164

00:08:41.016  -->  00:08:43.454
sprite file, and now from here we have to select
165

165

00:08:43.454  -->  00:08:48.249
the icon that we want, so let's see how it's called.
166

166

00:08:48.249  -->  00:08:50.048
And it's called 'icon magnifying glass.'
167

167

00:08:50.048  -->  00:08:51.381
Let's copy that,
168

168

00:08:52.242  -->  00:08:56.422
and now we use hash and then the name of the icon.
169

169

00:08:56.422  -->  00:08:58.349
And that's actually it.
170

170

00:08:58.349  -->  00:09:00.849
So closing it, and here we go.
171

171

00:09:01.960  -->  00:09:05.327
So this is really the best way to include SVG's in HTML
172

172

00:09:05.327  -->  00:09:08.485
using a SVG sprite like we did.
173

173

00:09:08.485  -->  00:09:10.342
And that's because this way, we can actually change
174

174

00:09:10.342  -->  00:09:13.535
the color of each of the icons using CSS.
175

175

00:09:13.535  -->  00:09:17.134
And I'm gonna show you how in a little bit.
176

176

00:09:17.134  -->  00:09:18.980
Now another thing that I need to tell you,
177

177

00:09:18.980  -->  00:09:22.753
is that using SVG's like this with the 'xlink href'
178

178

00:09:22.753  -->  00:09:25.911
attribute is only going to work on a web server.
179

179

00:09:25.911  -->  00:09:28.826
So only on the web server, you will be able to see this
180

180

00:09:28.826  -->  00:09:30.776
sprite SVG file.
181

181

00:09:30.776  -->  00:09:32.378
But since we're doing that, actually,
182

182

00:09:32.378  -->  00:09:37.103
we are using a web server which is this local one here.
183

183

00:09:37.103  -->  00:09:41.248
So this local web server and that's why it actually works.
184

184

00:09:41.248  -->  00:09:44.209
And so here is our SVG icon, right?
185

185

00:09:44.209  -->  00:09:47.297
So everything works perfectly, and we're now ready to start
186

186

00:09:47.297  -->  00:09:51.639
using SVG's in our HTML, and that's a great step.
187

187

00:09:51.639  -->  00:09:54.100
Now this is of course not formatted here at all,
188

188

00:09:54.100  -->  00:09:56.318
but we're gonna take care of that later.
189

189

00:09:56.318  -->  00:09:58.605
And another advantage actually, of SVG,
190

190

00:09:58.605  -->  00:10:01.519
is that it makes it really easy to format these icons.
191

191

00:10:01.519  -->  00:10:04.108
With icon fonts, it always really hard to
192

192

00:10:04.108  -->  00:10:06.082
put them exactly the way we want it.
193

193

00:10:06.082  -->  00:10:08.265
But with SVG's, that problem is gone
194

194

00:10:08.265  -->  00:10:10.517
and it's actually super easy.
195

195

00:10:10.517  -->  00:10:14.100
Okay, and now finally, the user navigation.
196

196

00:10:15.974  -->  00:10:18.563
So, we're using the 'nav' HTML element here,
197

197

00:10:18.563  -->  00:10:20.146
for the navigation.
198

198

00:10:22.324  -->  00:10:25.029
And then in here, I'm going to put three boxes.
199

199

00:10:25.029  -->  00:10:26.759
So let me show that to you,
200

200

00:10:26.759  -->  00:10:28.849
so one box for each of these,
201

201

00:10:28.849  -->  00:10:31.763
this box, this box, and this box.
202

202

00:10:31.763  -->  00:10:33.180
So let's do that.
203

203

00:10:35.664  -->  00:10:38.102
So 'user-nav', the name of the block,
204

204

00:10:38.102  -->  00:10:41.019
nav icon, and then in here our SVG.
205

205

00:10:43.805  -->  00:10:47.330
Now actually this is not the name that I wanted here.
206

206

00:10:47.330  -->  00:10:49.745
Let me change that.
207

207

00:10:49.745  -->  00:10:50.929
So, 'Icon Box',
208

208

00:10:50.929  -->  00:10:52.334
so now it's okay.
209

209

00:10:52.334  -->  00:10:54.598
So this is the box where an icon will sit,
210

210

00:10:54.598  -->  00:10:57.431
and this one is the user-nav icon,
211

211

00:11:00.914  -->  00:11:03.781
and now let's use the 'use' again.
212

212

00:11:03.781  -->  00:11:06.364
So 'xlink href' and IMG sprite.
213

213

00:11:11.653  -->  00:11:14.486
And this time, let's check it out.
214

214

00:11:15.600  -->  00:11:18.967
We will want to use the, now here it is,
215

215

00:11:18.967  -->  00:11:22.102
it's closed, the IcoMoon, so we want the one called
216

216

00:11:22.102  -->  00:11:26.269
icon 'Bookmark' and the next one called icon 'Chat.'
217

217

00:11:30.798  -->  00:11:34.298
So icon bookmark, and next time icon chat.
218

218

00:11:36.150  -->  00:11:38.900
Let's actually copy that already.
219

219

00:11:43.360  -->  00:11:47.876
Okay, so icon chat, give it some space here, alright.
220

220

00:11:47.876  -->  00:11:50.291
And actually, we also want like, this notification
221

221

00:11:50.291  -->  00:11:52.056
indicator here.
222

222

00:11:52.056  -->  00:11:56.049
So this small notification circle here,
223

223

00:11:56.049  -->  00:11:58.799
so let's just put 'span' element,
224

224

00:12:00.972  -->  00:12:04.305
which I'm calling user-nav-notification,
225

225

00:12:05.187  -->  00:12:06.928
and here let's put a seven,
226

226

00:12:06.928  -->  00:12:10.261
and then in the other one, let's put 13.
227

227

00:12:15.264  -->  00:12:17.431
Okay and now the next box,
228

228

00:12:20.198  -->  00:12:25.074
user-nav, and this one I'm calling simply the 'user.'
229

229

00:12:25.074  -->  00:12:28.907
So if you have an image here, as you remember,
230

230

00:12:33.178  -->  00:12:35.256
and this one is called, I think
231

231

00:12:35.256  -->  00:12:37.393
it's the one just called 'user',
232

232

00:12:37.393  -->  00:12:40.226
it's actually a picture of myself.
233

233

00:12:42.362  -->  00:12:46.529
So user photo and then just a 'span' for the name.
234

234

00:12:50.245  -->  00:12:54.328
So user-nav, user-name, and then my name in here.
235

235

00:12:56.479  -->  00:12:59.730
And that is our HTML markup for the header.
236

236

00:12:59.730  -->  00:13:01.897
So let's check it out now.
237

237

00:13:02.772  -->  00:13:05.860
And it looks, of course, terrible at this point.
238

238

00:13:05.860  -->  00:13:07.010
(laughter)
239

239

00:13:07.010  -->  00:13:09.099
So let's try to do some quick formatting here,
240

240

00:13:09.099  -->  00:13:10.249
especially of the images and icons
241

241

00:13:10.249  -->  00:13:11.317
which are now really huge.
242

242

00:13:11.317  -->  00:13:13.150
So we should fix that.
243

243

00:13:14.440  -->  00:13:17.540
So let's now open our components file here,
244

244

00:13:17.540  -->  00:13:19.572
because from now on, I'm gonna write all the code
245

245

00:13:19.572  -->  00:13:24.320
for all the smaller components right here into this file.
246

246

00:13:24.320  -->  00:13:26.259
Now this stuff that we're gonna put here,
247

247

00:13:26.259  -->  00:13:29.370
these are not really components in the meaning
248

248

00:13:29.370  -->  00:13:30.601
that I gave them in the last project.
249

249

00:13:30.601  -->  00:13:34.293
So they're not necessarily really reusable across projects
250

250

00:13:34.293  -->  00:13:37.126
but I'm still calling them simply components here
251

251

00:13:37.126  -->  00:13:41.433
because that's the easiest way to do it here right now.
252

252

00:13:41.433  -->  00:13:44.433
So this one is simply called 'logo.'
253

253

00:13:46.263  -->  00:13:50.180
And what I want here is the height of 3.25 ram,
254

254

00:13:51.998  -->  00:13:54.866
so remember once again that this project is not really
255

255

00:13:54.866  -->  00:13:57.490
about CSS architecture and all that stuff that I showed
256

256

00:13:57.490  -->  00:13:59.870
you in the last project because these are really important.
257

257

00:13:59.870  -->  00:14:02.796
But in this project, I just want to focus on flexbox
258

258

00:14:02.796  -->  00:14:05.303
and on building this app.
259

259

00:14:05.303  -->  00:14:07.451
So, that is the logo and let me actually put
260

260

00:14:07.451  -->  00:14:11.956
a comment here on each of these so-called components.
261

261

00:14:11.956  -->  00:14:16.123
So just a line of these slashes here to separate them,
262

262

00:14:17.842  -->  00:14:20.259
and then I simply say 'logo.'
263

263

00:14:22.242  -->  00:14:26.159
And now I do the same thing for the search box.
264

264

00:14:33.167  -->  00:14:37.084
And down here, the same thing for the user-nav.
265

265

00:14:42.838  -->  00:14:46.255
So search, and in here we have the input.
266

266

00:14:50.083  -->  00:14:54.083
And of course it's two underscores and a button.
267

267

00:14:58.187  -->  00:15:01.287
Let's see if we have something else here.
268

268

00:15:01.287  -->  00:15:05.454
So we have the input button, oh and this icon as well.
269

269

00:15:12.096  -->  00:15:14.836
And now for the user navigation, let's also put
270

270

00:15:14.836  -->  00:15:17.086
the selectors here already.
271

271

00:15:19.015  -->  00:15:22.598
So user-nav, and here we have the icon box.
272

272

00:15:25.981  -->  00:15:27.177
And let's see what else we have.
273

273

00:15:27.177  -->  00:15:30.416
So icon box, then we have icon here,
274

274

00:15:30.416  -->  00:15:34.758
notification, user, user photo, and user name.
275

275

00:15:34.758  -->  00:15:38.175
So there's a lot of stuff to select here.
276

276

00:15:39.600  -->  00:15:40.600
So icon box,
277

277

00:15:44.464  -->  00:15:45.297
icon,
278

278

00:15:49.956  -->  00:15:52.039
we have the notification,
279

279

00:15:58.419  -->  00:15:59.252
the user,
280

280

00:16:03.330  -->  00:16:06.497
user photo, and finally the user name.
281

281

00:16:11.643  -->  00:16:14.522
So that's a lot to format here but
282

282

00:16:14.522  -->  00:16:18.528
what I want to start with for now is these huge parts.
283

283

00:16:18.528  -->  00:16:21.790
So you already gave the icon here a smaller size,
284

284

00:16:21.790  -->  00:16:25.146
but we want to do the same with this magnifying glass,
285

285

00:16:25.146  -->  00:16:26.829
and with these two icons, and of course,
286

286

00:16:26.829  -->  00:16:29.662
with this user image here.
287

287

00:16:29.662  -->  00:16:31.891
So let's do that right now.
288

288

00:16:31.891  -->  00:16:35.281
So let's start with the search icon here,
289

289

00:16:35.281  -->  00:16:38.404
now how do we actually format an SVG icon?
290

290

00:16:38.404  -->  00:16:41.191
Well, it's really easy compared to icon fonts,
291

291

00:16:41.191  -->  00:16:45.544
all we have to do is to set it's height and it's width
292

292

00:16:45.544  -->  00:16:48.633
in order to size it the way we want.
293

293

00:16:48.633  -->  00:16:52.800
So let's set to ram for both the height and width.
294

294

00:16:55.169  -->  00:16:57.677
Check it out, and here we go.
295

295

00:16:57.677  -->  00:16:59.844
And now it's really small.
296

296

00:17:01.729  -->  00:17:04.480
And now here for the user nav icons as well.
297

297

00:17:04.480  -->  00:17:07.603
And these here should be slightly bigger,
298

298

00:17:07.603  -->  00:17:11.770
so I'm putting 2.25 ram for both the height and width.
299

299

00:17:13.350  -->  00:17:14.183
2.25 ram.
300

300

00:17:16.926  -->  00:17:19.840
And now finally the user photo,
301

301

00:17:19.840  -->  00:17:22.757
let's give it a height of 3.75 ram.
302

302

00:17:24.124  -->  00:17:26.876
And since we're at it, I'll also make it around
303

303

00:17:26.876  -->  00:17:29.209
a border radius of 50%.
304

304

00:17:31.346  -->  00:17:34.306
And then let's see how it looks like right now.
305

305

00:17:34.306  -->  00:17:37.580
That looks better but still far from perfect.
306

306

00:17:37.580  -->  00:17:39.763
So in the next lecture, we're gonna take care of
307

307

00:17:39.763  -->  00:17:42.677
actually aligning all of these items properly using,
308

308

00:17:42.677  -->  00:17:45.382
of course, flexbox, and then to style everything
309

309

00:17:45.382  -->  00:17:49.039
so that it looks great just like this here.
310

310

00:17:49.039  -->  00:17:51.710
Okay, so that's what we're gonna take care of
311

311

00:17:51.710  -->  00:17:54.543
in the next lecture, see you then.
