00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.770
Let's take another scenario.

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:04.330
I'm gonna enter a valid number.

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:05.820
Let's say 34.

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:09.670
Click on print table and I'll see the table for 34.

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:12.570
But in order for me to try another number,

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.290
I had to click the back button off the browser.

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:16.420
Similarly,

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:20.190
if I type here some alphanumeric by Lukic unprintable,

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:21.130
I get another.

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.690
But if I want to try a valid number,

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.440
I have to click the back button off the browser toe.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:26.970
Go back.

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:33.110
How about including this HTML content in the result whatever that comes,

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.550
whether it's an error message or whether it's a proper multiplication table,

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:41.140
we would like this HTML content to be part of this one.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.730
Way to do is using outdoor parental and statement.

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.650
Maybe right over here,

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:51.120
we can say outdoor print Ellen and then the content off.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.950
All these there are 18 lines are placed minimum off these many lines I have toe include

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:58.590
that over here on.

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.440
There are two problems with this Number one,

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.460
we are accelerating lot of HTML.

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.520
Inside a separate number two.

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.810
We could reuse this HTML inside a summit,

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:08.300
so there,

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.750
too,

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:09.630
solutions.

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.650
The 2nd 1 is the better one.

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:13.640
Where I can include another.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.010
The source in this case the resource I want to include is a HTML file.

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.490
But it shows that you want to include maybe an extreme el file,

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.970
maybe another subtler it or maybe a jsp.

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.690
So since we want to include the table knowledge team and let's see how that can be done to

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:29.260
do that,

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:34.150
you create a variable off an interface called request Dispatcher.

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:34.810
So,

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:35.820
like the name says,

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.890
it's job is toe dispatch toe another request.

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.730
So let's call it us already equals toe request.

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:48.670
The object that we have received over here dot get requests,

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:54.550
dispatcher toe you are the euro has to be a later part.

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.210
It cannot be an absolute part.

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.240
So whatever you give will be considered as part off your application.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.180
So it cannot be 1/3 party website application.

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:10.590
So what we have to give here is probably dark slash stable door html are simply table dot

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.310
html and that's a request dispatcher.

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.970
We didn't create that variable already.

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:21.440
So we have to create that by pressing command one or control one on windows press enter.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:27.570
You got a request dispatcher the request dispatcher can do one of two things.

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:28.490
Number one.

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:34.770
It can include the content off that right in this particular place at landing with 32 then

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.350
proceed toe this section.

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:37.720
Ultimately,

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:38.810
we can also say,

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:39.080
Hey,

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.450
I don't want to produce any old put here.

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:47.250
I just want toe forward to this particular table that estimates of the two options in this

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.170
case the most appropriate one is toe include the content.

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:52.510
So to include the country,

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.680
we're gonna say already dot Include,

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.430
you also see that there is a function called forward.

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:03.460
Both of them have exact same perimeters That takes the parameters that v receive.

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:10.310
So remember the question response parameters are coming from Apache Tomcat were using that

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:11.430
to produce our output.

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:17.320
We passed the same thing toe the request dispatcher so will supply your request and

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:18.240
response.

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:23.390
That means the included resource in this case is the HTML.

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.340
But if that happens to be another sunlit,

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.410
it has access toe everything in the request object as well as the response objects.

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:34.180
Since it is the same response object What we have got over here,

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:41.810
the table or HTML is also written to the same response and then response is given back to

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:42.230
us,

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:48.010
and we are continuing to print our values to the same response Once the function is

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:48.460
finished,

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:50.690
including the content of table knowledge demon,

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:55.160
the same response is now being returned with more content over here.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.060
So let's save this.

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.660
Restart our dunk it,

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.740
then go back to the page.

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:03.160
Here,

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.260
let's try for stare Valid number.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.830
Let's type your 23 click on print table.

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:13.780
You'll see now the HTML file is written first and then the table for 23.

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.930
If I type here some D F G and press print table,

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:22.050
you'll see that it says invalid input Onley into Just are alone.

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:25.400
So here the HTML file is included.

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.390
If I go back over here and then change the function toe forward,

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:32.520
this is an inappropriate function over here,

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.010
because now the response is being initialized over here.

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:38.590
So we got the output stream here.

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.250
We have said the content type,

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:46.530
and now that the responses given toe the already or request dispatcher that actually clears

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:48.260
anything return before that.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:52.350
That means in case if something has been written before forwarding,

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:58.910
that will be clear from the output buffer on then once table that it's demon is included.

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:00.730
The output stream is also closed,

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:04.190
so whatever that you're writing will not be written at all.

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:06.100
So if I go back to the browser,

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:08.420
let's say I type in some number.

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:09.510
Click on printable.

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:12.430
You'll see that the actual people is not printed,

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:14.950
so the control goes to this section.

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:18.050
But output stream has already bean closed,

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:23.820
so the older print Eleanor Print of has no Effect so far were is off.

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:25.480
No use in this scenario,

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:30.070
but most of the time when we were working with NBC applications or Model view controller

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.860
application,

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:32.870
this is what we do in a separate.

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:36.970
So we do forwards more than include for this demo.

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:40.160
Let's bring back the include Function again,

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.650
go to the Star Wars,

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:45.430
restart the server and then check it out.

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:46.080
Once again,

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:52.870
that's typing a valid number 55 print table regarded some alphanumeric value print table

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:54.680
begotten as well.

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:59.330
So this is so you can use request dispatcher toe include a resource,

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:01.770
our forward to a different resource
