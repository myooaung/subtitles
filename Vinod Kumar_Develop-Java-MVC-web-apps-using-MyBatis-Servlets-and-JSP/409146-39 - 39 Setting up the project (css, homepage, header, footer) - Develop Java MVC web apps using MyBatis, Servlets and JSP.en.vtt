00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.490
From this point forward,

00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:03.790
we will be working on a mini project,

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:06.130
putting together everything that we have low until now.

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:07.560
From the word go,

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.850
we will follow the best practices in the industry.

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:12.580
So let's get started first.

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:19.150
Let's create a brand new project for this So select fine New Memin Project.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.090
Create a simple project by skipping the archetype selection.

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.450
Click the next Button group idea.

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:27.240
Let's give it us cord out.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.410
We know Onda artifact.

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:29.750
Really?

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:31.350
Let's give it us phone book.

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:33.440
Very important Leader packaging.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.950
We have to select us water because this is gonna be a project optionally.

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:40.330
You can give name and description,

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:43.500
so let's keep that and click the finish straight away.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.530
We see some errors,

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.260
and this is mainly because everyone project must have a Abdal XML,

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.950
which is missing.

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:50.960
We will add that in a couple of minutes,

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.260
But first let's go and are the maven compile a plug in tow or Palmdale XML.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.150
Let's go here.

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:04.460
And then I'd hear a tag called Build and inside that the plug in style.

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.210
It contains one or more plug ins,

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:14.710
so I'm gonna add one plug in here and the Le Guin should have artifact 80 which is going to

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:20.510
be made when compiler plug in and it comes with a configuration.

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.260
And inside the configuration,

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.730
we're going to specify source is going to be wondered.

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:31.170
Aid Wash in and Target is also going to be wondered.

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.550
Eight.

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.930
Let's say this on then make sure toe update the projects.

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:37.650
I'm gonna write like the project.

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.150
May 1 updated project.

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.250
Click on OK Onda.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:50.710
Now if I go to the project menu and then Goto properties the Java build part libraries,

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.590
you can see that the job abortion is wondered.

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:54.020
Eight.

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.510
That's what the intention of this plugging.

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:00.850
So now let's fix the backdoor XML problem by rightly condo project.

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.950
And then there is an option here called Java EE tools.

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.400
There is an option toe gender deployment,

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.210
descriptor stuff,

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:12.200
and we know that deployment descriptor is nothing with the backdoor XML and hence have a

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.250
maximalist added.

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.180
The other is gone.

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.800
We also have all Apache conquered from the previous projects which is currently serving

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:20.750
satellite demo.

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.030
We can keep this,

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.190
but women also removed this from the tanker just to reduce the footprint.

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.250
So let's right click on the project once and then run us.

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.740
I don't answer what we would like.

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.830
Toa always use this Aurora while running the project because that's the only one that I

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:37.140
have.

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.540
So I'm gonna click on next.

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:39.980
And this is where I can say,

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:40.160
Hey,

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.200
I would like to remove this tablet demo because I don't want to unnecessarily building my

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:44.770
Tomcat.

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:45.400
So I'll say,

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.020
remove on notice.

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.520
Clicking on the removal doesn't remove your current project because that's the one we are

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:51.280
trying to run,

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.680
and it has to be part of the Apache Tomcat.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:54.200
So let's click.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.360
Finish the confirmation.

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.320
Are you sure you want to remove the resource from the server?

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.690
Let's say Okay,

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:01.450
I'm sure.

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:02.520
Onda.

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.770
Now,

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:03.130
of course,

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:09.170
it's going toe start Apache Tomcat on come up with for Not for because I don't have any

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.900
index start.

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.350
It's TML our index jsp that's going at the same thing.

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:20.320
We know that the Js did are supposed to be accessed only from within the server and not the

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.910
browser.

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.630
So we don't want the end user taxes the GSPC.

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:25.570
So as a best practice,

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:29.550
let's goto a SERC folder under main verb.

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:37.190
You have the veb enough so Let's keep the JSP files inside the vagina on instead of messing

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:38.790
around with on the other fights.

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.930
Let's also create a sub folder here.

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.400
General practices.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.020
You keep the name of the folders views.

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:46.580
So I'm going to do the same thing.

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:48.630
And then inside that,

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.120
I'm gonna create a file,

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.280
which is gonna be a jsp file.

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.980
The name of the file can be anything.

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.400
We can still make that as a home page.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.520
For example,

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:01.030
instead of calling it as indexed or JSP,

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.050
let's call it US home dot jsp For a change,

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.620
I click the next button on.

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.780
This is the template that I want a team and fight template tactic on finish.

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.450
We got our homepage.

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:20.180
Let's change the title as that's a phone book application on give the same thing as Hitch

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.420
one.

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:21.300
For the time being.

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:23.510
Save this.

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:32.030
Let's try running this project by a tick on this and then say run as a non answer or you

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:39.400
can see that it still gives 404 because the end user cannot access the Gabbana for that.

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.010
So what we actually want is we want Tonka toe,

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.390
sir,

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:49.610
home that jsp when we access the root off your project and this can be done by going back

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.320
to the web dot xml that we have got over here.

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:53.780
You can see a bunch off.

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.050
Welcome finalists is there here?

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.740
We have to add an entry here related toe.

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.560
Our homepage on the homepage is none off them.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:07.250
So I'm gonna remove all of them here and then start with a slash web,

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:11.010
enough views and then home dark GSP.

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:13.450
Since you are mentioning the home jsp here,

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:18.740
this is why I told the name of the file can be anything save this terrible may need to be

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:21.670
restarted because we are modifying the contracting type of ever.

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:22.720
And if so,

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.530
let's restart this on the surgery is ready.

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:28.230
Let's go back over here on day.

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:33.680
I'm gonna press enter here and I should not get phone book application homepage.

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.030
Let's go back toe clips.

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:41.350
You can see that there is a better in home dog gspc if I go to the markers here,

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:47.480
the jsp problem It is that the super class Java extrapolate dotted city peed on the chilly

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:47.830
pixel.

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:50.800
It was not found on the class pot,

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:51.360
our will.

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.710
But now If you go to the Project properties,

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:58.650
you'll see that we don't have our server runtime here.

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:02.260
That is the reason why we're getting so we're able to successfully deploy the APP.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:03.480
However,

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.260
during the compilation time,

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:09.810
Eclipse is not able to find the Sarwar Runtime there two ways to our this one.

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:14.620
We can go to the ad library and then choose the Sarah Runtime.

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:20.330
The 2nd 1 is by going to the targeted runtime over here and take on the Tomcat.

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:21.470
So let's like this.

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:22.760
Let's apply.

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:23.480
And then,

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:25.740
if I come back to the job Bill Pot,

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:29.300
you can see that there is Apache Tomcat libraries.

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:30.690
Alito our build.

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:33.230
But so if I say playing close now,

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:35.140
we can see that the errors are gone.

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:37.730
So let's go back to our home dot chase P.

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:41.010
And now we want toe beautify our application.

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:46.340
In orderto apply some styling instead of writing all the thesis by ourselves,

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:49.050
or we can make yourself very beautiful.

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:53.130
CSS three more card booster so you can go toe,

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:53.810
get food,

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:57.370
shop dot com and click the download button,

00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:03.690
and you can see you can either download the compile the CSS and Js files that is really to

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:04.430
be applied to.

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:09.010
You can download discipline consisting off CSS Jolla,

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:12.800
stipulated toe boots shot and then add to your project.

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:16.020
You also have access to the source code in case if you would like toa,

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:18.250
edit the source code and then use them.

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:23.510
You also have another option called CD and Syrian Stand for Content delivery network.

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:28.240
So somewhere on the Internet are somewhere on the cloud.

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:30.950
This particular CSS JavaScript will be there.

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:35.880
You can simply click the copy button actor your it's TML at the wrong time.

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:37.030
It'll access this year,

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:37.360
old girl,

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:41.920
and then get the bootstrap Mean doxy S and J's on the flight.

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:42.850
Alternately,

00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:44.310
there are other mechanisms.

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:48.360
If you are using journalistic frameworks like angular or react,

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:54.040
you can use the NPM install to do that so we don't want to use anyone off this.

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:58.860
So the best method is for us to download this,

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:02.870
compile CSS and Jace and then use the same thing Internet downloading,

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:05.660
the compile CSS and Jay's from here,

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:07.630
which gives us all the styling required,

00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:12.180
but that is going to be having a very default basic look and feel.

00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:18.470
We have another option where we can download it from some teamed bootstrap liberalise.

00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:20.870
One such provider is the Boots.

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:25.790
Watch dot com Safer go toe boots watch dot com If you scroll down,

00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:30.420
you'll see different teams on you can choose whichever the team that you are interested in

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:30.420
,

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:32.650
and I'm going to select this one,

00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:34.830
which is very simple and nice.

00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:36.980
Select the download button.

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:38.360
Here it is.

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:40.920
Don't know this bootstrap mindo CSS.

00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:41.770
It's going toe.

00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:45.250
Download the bootstrap mean dark CSS onto your required fuller.

00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:45.890
In my case,

00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:50.190
I want to go to my desktop where I had the training workspace on inside that I have the

00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:52.240
phone book on inside.

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:56.590
I have a saucy main the back,

00:08:56.590 --> 00:08:58.510
and this is where we need to keep it.

00:08:58.510 --> 00:08:59.940
But instead of keeping it directly,

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:01.690
we can keep it inside a folder.

00:09:01.690 --> 00:09:07.280
Let's keep that in the folder called Assets and Inside the Assets.

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:09.850
Let's keep a folder called Styles.

00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:11.970
Andi.

00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:13.310
Inside the States folder.

00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:16.150
I'm gonna keep this bootstrap dot mindo CSS.

00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:20.480
Let's click on the steel and come back toe our eclipse.

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:21.550
No,

00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:22.380
it is in the eclipse.

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:22.670
It is.

00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:24.100
I'm going to reflect automatically.

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:25.280
So you map to right click.

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:28.360
Either the project are the appropriate for lead in our case,

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:29.700
this is the told us.

00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:33.930
I'm gonna right click here and then say the fresh Oregon pressed F five.

00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:38.250
And then you can see there that assets folded inside that you have a styles folder and

00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:39.570
inside that you have the bootstrap,

00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:40.600
mean dark CSS.

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:46.190
And now I can add a link tag here to represent that particular CSS file.

00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:54.420
So we're gonna come here and then add a link relic on still stand sheet on the type of the

00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:57.160
station that we're using is Texas last year,

00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:57.610
sis.

00:09:57.610 --> 00:10:04.320
And the reference to that is going to be dot slash assets slash styles on,

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:06.850
then boost up dot mindo.

00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:09.720
See is this and let's just close this time,

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:13.270
notice that dot here is a related part.

00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:19.990
But don't confuse that it's going to be found related to views because the dagger is being

00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:23.480
interpreted by the browser and not by your jsp engine,

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:29.440
because of which the browser will try to relate this as the related parts from where it has

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:29.920
come from.

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:30.700
For example,

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:36.050
if you see that the index speech came from this Ural so related to this,

00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:38.250
it's going to say from this location,

00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:41.910
asset styles put stubbed out window TSS.

00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:45.060
So that's gonna work just to check If this is working,

00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:48.130
let's go back and then do a reload on.

00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:49.250
If I refresh,

00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:51.530
you should see that the font has changed,

00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:54.370
indicating that the CSS has done its job.

00:10:54.370 --> 00:10:59.210
Let's come back toe clips and add some CSS plus to this home Dajae speak.

00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:00.900
If you're not familiar with the boots,

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:02.460
stop CSS Cramer.

00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:08.380
Just follow along with me and I will be explaining different seasons classes on what?

00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:09.170
Actually they do.

00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:12.260
So the number one is the alert.

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:15.460
So the other gives your background color so we can say here,

00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:18.050
do plants equals toe alert,

00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:19.730
Alert Dash,

00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:25.480
And then you can use one off the primary secondary success Danger Warning in four.

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:29.950
So I'm gonna select your primary that is going to give it a primary color combination.

00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:33.570
And if you want to know what is the primary color for this particular team,

00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:35.730
you can always go to the boots.

00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:36.490
Watch on,

00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:41.440
Then you can see that this is the color off the primary secondary success in for warning

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:42.040
and danger.

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:43.460
Typically would be red.

00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:50.700
So let's go back or here on inside that I want to create something called Deal Class equals

00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:51.830
toe container.

00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:52.680
This is going toe.

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:57.160
Are they fixed to it their own 1100 pixel for this particular deal.

00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:59.850
And inside that I want to provide this h one,

00:11:59.850 --> 00:12:03.020
which is going to be our regular hitch one tag.

00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:05.850
So if I come back over here to my project,

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:07.170
do refresh,

00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:13.390
you can see that we have a nice blue collar background for our header on a fixed word for

00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:13.570
this.

00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:16.450
So the margin is coming because of the fixed to it over here.

00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:18.590
So if you don't know how much is their fixed work,

00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:22.800
go to the view developer developer tools.

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:25.220
Let's bring this developer tool at the bottom.

00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:29.230
You can dock it at the bottom here and then go to the elements.

00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:33.860
And if I said like this icon and then move the most on this,

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:38.300
you can see that it is it's 1110 pixels.

00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:40.270
Is the word off this particular hitch?

00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:40.610
One.

00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:46.310
What else for the entire screen you consider is 1920 because my screen size is quite big on

00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:46.310
.

00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:47.290
That is the reason we get.

00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:48.720
But in a typical laptop,

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:49.270
for example,

00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:53.890
this left side margin here would be small because the orders screen size would be a little

00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:54.460
bit smaller.

00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:59.260
Let's close this comeback toe Eclipse lets out another deal over here,

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:02.820
and this is going to be the main content area off our deal.

00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:09.860
So I'm gonna say they'll class because toe container on Let's had probably a hedge t will

00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:18.990
say Welcome to our phone book Web application on probably a hitch five with a polar by

00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:22.910
selects jsp on my back.

00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:28.180
This that's a bit and see how it's gonna look like on come back and refresh on.

00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:30.550
This is how it's gonna look like this is OK with me,

00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:34.350
and I also want a foot or so that at another do here.

00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:39.330
That's a do class equals toe container again,

00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:40.990
and everything inside is.

00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:46.860
I also wanted to be in the center so I can see your text dar center this again.

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:52.550
A bootstrap CSS plans to make sure that their text is in the middle and let's adhere a

00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:54.770
copyright so I'll say 1% copy,

00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:55.230
cynical,

00:13:55.230 --> 00:14:01.880
and that's going to give you A copyright symbol lets it 2020 2021 All rights,

00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:04.390
the result by,

00:14:04.390 --> 00:14:04.730
let's say,

00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:05.300
for example,

00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:07.240
I give my company name.

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:08.950
Let's take a view Note Inc.

00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:12.580
And I want this to be surrounded by a hyperlinks.

00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:18.280
I can cut this and then say a hatred equals to something on inside that I'm gonna based on

00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:26.600
this could be my website named Https Colon double slash www We know dot So we do have our

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:26.980
foot.

00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:29.380
Or now let's save this comeback.

00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:30.470
Tore eclipse,

00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:32.470
reload on the footer.

00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:36.020
Comes right below here and you can see that we have a copyright symbol and then they're

00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:38.570
they're happening toe my website.

00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:39.370
However,

00:14:39.370 --> 00:14:44.570
I want this foot or toe come a place our own 400 to find pixels below.

00:14:44.570 --> 00:14:45.410
Even if it is empty.

00:14:45.410 --> 00:14:47.290
I don't want the future to be on the top.

00:14:47.290 --> 00:14:48.810
I want to put it to be somewhere here.

00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:53.450
But if the content gross and obviously the foot also will be at the bottom.

00:14:53.450 --> 00:14:54.130
So to do that,

00:14:54.130 --> 00:14:57.940
let's go back over here began other style toe this.

00:14:57.940 --> 00:14:59.210
Do saying that Hey,

00:14:59.210 --> 00:15:01.550
there is a minimum height requirement off.

00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:03.990
Let there on 450 pixels.

00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:07.380
I'm going to say your style equals toe min.

00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:09.510
Height off.

00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:15.100
Let's say 450 pixels save this comeback and refreshing.

00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:18.380
You should see that the footer has come down.

00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:22.280
So even on the home page this is going to look like this If you want,

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:24.740
you can control this by adding another 100 pixels.

00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:26.910
Cerrone 550 pixels.

00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:31.150
Say this comeback refresh And I think they should be okay.

00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:35.450
Since I want this to be my common look and feel for the entire project,

00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:40.160
we can reuse the header and footer using the static imports.

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:41.480
So let's do that.

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:43.820
I'm gonna go back to my project,

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:46.400
exploded here on under views.

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:48.160
I'm gonna create fine.

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:50.770
I can give any extension I want,

00:15:50.770 --> 00:15:55.750
but the preferred extension is jsp f indicating it's a JCB fragment.

00:15:55.750 --> 00:16:00.100
So I'm gonna right click here and then say New fight on the name of the file.

00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:04.180
I want to give it us header dot jsp f.

00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:05.860
It's empty right now.

00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:07.490
We'll add some content over years.

00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:15.330
Let's also add the foot older j SPF So new file and then say footer dot jsp f Let's go to

00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:21.390
the home dot jsp This is the actual content that will change from page to page.

00:16:21.390 --> 00:16:21.940
For example,

00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:25.700
if I'm in the log in page only this section will be replaced with a large inform.

00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:27.160
If I'm in the register placed,

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:31.840
this will be replaced to the register form Since this section is going to be considered as

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:36.830
head out So I can cut this from here and then based in the head older J sphere,

00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:39.660
I notice this may cause a warning here saying that Hey,

00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:41.890
you open a deal but there is no end of time,

00:16:41.890 --> 00:16:46.130
slash Do And that's OK for us because we never gonna access this directly.

00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:51.180
We access the home jsp which internally accesses the the head of dodgy SPF.

00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:57.540
So again I'm coming back to home dot jsp on that This section from here till the end is

00:16:57.540 --> 00:17:03.200
going to be a part of my foot or so I'm gonna cut this on then save this form Dajae SPF go

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:07.420
to the food order Jsp different pace the same thing once again you can see it says you

00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:12.720
haven't ending type but there is no beginning type or the start of time do available?

00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:13.920
That's okay.

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:15.100
Let's save the head.

00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:15.600
O J.

00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:15.990
Spears,

00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:17.150
Go back to the browser.

00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:21.060
Refresh Because the home guard Jsp doesn't refer to the header and footer.

00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:21.750
All right,

00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:23.910
now you will see that your styling is gone.

00:17:23.910 --> 00:17:25.930
You still see Hits three and Hitch five.

00:17:25.930 --> 00:17:32.320
But let's come back over to our home that jsp and then include the header and footer by

00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:38.760
adding the static include directors I'm gonna save percentage at include finally calls toe

00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:43.540
In the current folder there is something called header dot ci STs Onda.

00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:44.110
Likewise,

00:17:44.110 --> 00:17:46.050
I'm gonna copy and he has the same thing over here.

00:17:46.050 --> 00:17:47.950
Toe change this toe footer,

00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:49.490
Say this.

00:17:49.490 --> 00:17:55.750
Go back over here and then reload on now you can see we have our common look and feel back

00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:58.600
again that's unfold this lecture.

00:17:58.600 --> 00:17:59.730
See you in the next one
