00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.120
in this lecture.

00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:01.960
Let's take a look.

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:04.020
A database schema on.

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:05.390
I'm gonna keep it very simple.

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.950
Our database schema is going to consist off two tables.

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:10.780
One is called users.

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:13.820
These are the users who are other toe our new contacts.

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:14.630
Modify them,

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.750
delete them if they don't want our search through their contacts,

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.330
the regions in the table are used for logging as well.

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.900
So the you the stable is gonna contain idee name email password.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:26.920
Also,

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:33.460
as far as best practices concerned that had created underscored at the second table is a

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.750
table that represents an unusual contact.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.410
This has an ultra generated idee.

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.140
There is a first name,

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:42.070
last name,

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:42.630
email,

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:43.100
phone,

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.490
these the contact details.

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:48.330
And then there is a column for storing the outer links.

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:52.310
And then we have the additional contacted l Sitter's address.

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:54.880
City pin code state country.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.340
Very importantly,

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.650
a record in the stable belongs to a record in the U the stable.

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:05.510
So there is a one to many association between users and context table.

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:11.690
So one user has zero are more contacts because of which we need to have a foreign king over

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:12.000
here.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.620
So that's gonna be user underscore.

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.460
80 on Also as a good practice,

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.170
Let's add created underscored at.

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.680
So let's go and create these two tables in our H two database.

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.290
I haven't started the It's too database yet,

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.200
so let's Goto Finder window on Microsoft Windows.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:35.230
You open a Windows Explorer and go to the location off your May 1 depository and Mike,

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:36.590
it is the home directory.

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:37.530
Under that,

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.280
I have a dot m to the repository.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:47.900
Under that we have come thanks to a database heads to one dart forward 197 and there is a

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.450
job file on Microsoft Windows.

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.910
You can just double click this jar file on Mac OS and Lennox.

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:58.030
I have to execute this from the command prompt I'm going to right click here and then say

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.670
Copy.

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.570
Hitched to wonder for 197 job on an open air terminal,

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.950
our command prompt on Microsoft windows and then simply say,

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.850
Jolla Miners job and then paste the entire pot on press enter to start the levy Sir World.

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:19.140
And that comes up with our hedge to console on notice that it remembers my previous

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.610
database,

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.050
which is the training user name is well known password is secret,

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:25.390
and then click on it.

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.350
We are inside our database.

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:28.550
So first,

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:29.840
let's create a table.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.990
And instead of creating that table directly over here,

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.900
we can actually go and create a file and then run the file from day.

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.560
So I'm gonna come back over here,

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.020
and since the script is not going to be part of you that project,

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.400
you can keep it outside of the SRC folder.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.290
So I'm gonna keep in the phone book project to directly That's right,

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.500
Click new file on the name of the file.

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.530
You can give anything you want.

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:58.420
I'm gonna call it as d b script dot SQL click on finish.

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:05.460
And here is where I want to clear the table so they create table users on inside that I

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:06.890
want to give i d,

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:08.490
which is offered type int,

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:10.310
and it's gonna be a primary key.

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.850
We'll also make us Otto on the score increment.

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:16.930
That's our name column.

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.980
Here is the name of the user who registers himself or herself.

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.140
So I'm gonna say name worker off little 50.

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.820
Not know we'll also type email.

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:29.770
This is gonna be the user name also.

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:35.090
So we're gonna save Erica off 255 on this is mandatory as well.

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:45.340
S supposed to be unique and boss word worker off 255 nocturnal and then one last is the

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:51.330
created underscored that there's going to be date time on our table structure is really

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:58.800
let's also create the 2nd 1 which is the feared table contacts on the context table is

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.930
going toe have again on ideas.

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.650
So I'm gonna copy this one line based over here,

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.900
but this being a contact,

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.250
we want more details about the context that we're gonna have.

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:17.310
First name worker off 50 not know Onda Last name is optional.

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.690
It's Midrash 50 characters again at email,

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:26.550
which is gonna be back it off 255 not know as well as unique.

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.880
And then we also want the phone number,

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.460
which is more or less the same thing.

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.990
But four numbers are going to be a smaller Let's give 100 characters.

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:40.430
So we're gonna say here for number is mandatory on Unique Also apart from that letter,

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.120
after which is going to be a link.

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.170
So I'll say Barca off to 55.

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:47.360
So the link sometimes will be big.

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.180
Then we're gonna give address.

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:50.590
This the street address,

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:55.600
maybe 2 55 characters is good enough for this option.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.740
Then we have city worker.

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:59.890
Let's 100.

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:00.660
You can.

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:00.880
Also,

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.420
the default is your city.

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:07.250
Which over the city you're from so I can leave that as it is right now up in court.

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:08.690
Work it off.

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:09.210
10.

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.680
Usually 5 to 6 numbers will be there.

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:12.830
But that's okay.

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:13.760
Lets out.

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:19.570
State bad cut off 50 and then country worker off.

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:20.320
I think fifties.

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:20.750
Okay,

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:22.620
one last is the creator.

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:27.350
That which is the date Times I'm gonna copy and paste the same thing over here.

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:31.860
These two tables are going to be joined using a giant column.

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.190
So this is the master table,

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:36.090
and this is the dependent table.

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:40.690
So this should have a Primerica off the master table as the reference.

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:43.760
So I'm gonna add over here called User Underscore,

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:47.900
Ready for which this is the contact as they IND.

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:50.100
And then I have to give the constraints.

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.060
So I'm gonna add the constraint at the end.

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:53.790
So it is a constraint.

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:55.330
Foreign key.

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:56.160
Underscore.

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:01.660
I can say users foreign key and then give the name of the column,

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:02.860
which is user Underscore.

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:09.550
80 references the user stable and inside the U the stable ideas the column that it refers

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:09.850
to.

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:13.670
So hopefully this is all fine to run the script.

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:15.730
I need the complete part off this.

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:19.550
I can right click this particular file and then say properties,

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:25.160
and then you can see that we have the location off that file so I can copy this entire line

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:25.160
.

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:29.110
Let's go back toe edge to console and then type here,

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:32.850
run script from and then in single court,

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:37.410
based the part of the particular file and click the run button on.

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:40.080
You can see that it says it created two tables,

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:41.900
contacts and users.

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:42.490
Of course,

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:43.440
before run this again,

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:46.730
it's going to give me an error because the table already exists.

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:50.310
And if you don't want to see the doctor every time you run the script,

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:55.090
all you do is you go back toe your script file and typing here.

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:57.250
Drop table forced.

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:58.640
You loaded up the dependent table,

00:06:58.640 --> 00:06:59.750
which is contacts.

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:01.260
I can say if exists,

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:02.590
So if the table existed,

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:04.430
only you tried deleting it similarly,

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:08.150
against a drop table users If exists.

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:10.190
Now the tables get deleted.

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:12.330
If they exist on then big,

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:13.270
it created again.

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:15.340
If you only can also add a couple off,

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:18.280
default the users for verification purposes.

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:21.650
But I think we will try adding them through our user interface.

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:22.910
So one last time,

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:25.640
let's go to the beach to console and then click the run.

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:27.610
But you can see now there is no other.

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:29.710
Each time I click on this run button,

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:30.640
there is no address.

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:32.150
It's running successfully,

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:34.380
dropping the table and recreating the same.

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:36.190
So that's all for this lecture.

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:37.570
See you in the next one.
