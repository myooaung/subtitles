00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.130
in this lecture.

00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:08.490
Let's create our first summit class by creating a new class that inherits from hits TTP

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.040
starlet Super Class To do so.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.150
Let's right click on our project and then say new class.

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.850
We can as well go and say new sunlit,

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:25.910
But this actually brings up a desert and those things automatically since we want to learn

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:27.110
the entire process.

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:31.050
So let's goto new class and then do it manually.

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.720
The first thing is the package that you want to do.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:34.810
So the package name.

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:36.330
I'm gonna give it us code out,

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:40.550
we know dot veb and then give the name of the class.

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:41.170
Hello,

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.450
sir.

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.940
Lit.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.600
You can mention what is the super plus either over here,

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.630
or you can click on the browse button and then type your hedge TDP several it.

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:51.730
As you can see,

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.550
it's not listing out the hits to DP sunlit over here.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:02.350
And the reason for that is we have to our additional job files for this particular project

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:02.350
.

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:03.670
So for the time being,

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.550
I'm gonna click on cancel and can tell that from here.

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.970
Now we can add additional jobs in two ways.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.510
Number one we can go to the farm dot xml and add the salad.

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:16.190
AP a.

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:17.760
Whatever the question that we want,

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.830
we can get that from every and deposited or comment,

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:21.520
and at that,

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.550
the other way to do is by using the jobs provided by Tom Kurt.

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.920
Since we have already downloaded the dunk it and then dunk,

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.850
it provides the charts required by all project.

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:39.530
We can simply boto project properties and then in the libraries under the Java build part,

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:45.730
I'd library so Warren thing in the next dialog box,

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:49.460
we can choose the Apache Tomcat 9.0 here.

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.550
So that's the one that contains all the jobs.

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.060
Click on finish on.

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.990
You will see that now.

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:59.710
Apache hunkered libraries have been added toe all project they face crawling over here.

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.380
You should see there is some like a p a job.

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:04.560
Let's click on,

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.580
apply and close on.

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.760
Now,

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.010
if I go right,

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:16.550
click on the project New class and then I take your cord art you know dot Ben and the name

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.150
of the class is going to be hollow,

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.850
several it.

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:23.090
And if I click on browse and say here Http,

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.670
suddenly you can see now there is Jolla extorts under Dotage DTP package and they're the

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.750
abstract class college studio sublet.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:31.930
Let's select that.

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:32.830
Say OK,

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.310
and then click finish.

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.950
So we got ourselves a new sunlit class.

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.610
The warning says that this class is an implementation off serial Izabal,

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:43.990
on a C relatable class,

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.340
must have a serial washing your i d.

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:53.150
So I select the default one on get off this comet And let's also overrate a function called

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.390
Do get over the matter.

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:00.300
You can press control space and then start typing the letters off the function that you

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.580
want.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:01.570
Toe override.

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:05.900
I want toe already do get So I selected and press enter.

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.230
Ultimately,

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.770
we could go toe source over,

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:14.620
implement metrics and then choose from the abstract Http,

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.000
suddenly which function do you want to override on?

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.310
Do get.

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.630
Of course,

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.150
since we already returned that it's not listed over here.

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:27.740
So I don't want this to go and the default implementation we want toe right.

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:34.150
Our own logic over here and all I want in the sunlight is to produce a hollow message on

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.520
toe.

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:35.600
Write a message.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:40.450
I need an output stream object which we can obtain from the restaurants object,

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:48.800
so I can see here out equals toe rest dot Get writer or you can also say Get all pushed in

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.670
if you want to read some binary later.

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:55.020
So I'll say get writer on out is not created as a variable.

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:57.800
So I live to press command one on windows.

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.050
You press control one and then create the local variable.

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:04.250
You can see it automatically imports the appropriate,

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.650
but in greater from Java your package.

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.240
Now that I have this,

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:14.180
I can now start raping out dot print statement or print Ellen and then type here whatever

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:15.250
that I want to open.

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.570
So I just want to put a single line,

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:18.560
which is nothing more.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:19.150
Hitch one.

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:20.080
Hello world.

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:26.350
Let's put a slash which one semi colon and I say how dark clothes.

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:29.620
If you want to mention the mind type,

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.180
you have to do before obtaining the or put steam.

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.290
So I had to do that.

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:42.250
Over here at the restaurant are set content type and then type here text slash html.

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:47.890
Now this is the one that instructs the browser whole toe handle this particular or put So

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:48.830
let's save this.

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:52.650
Know that we have created a class that is supposed to be a separate class.

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:58.740
We know that this is a solid but Apache Tonkin is not aware off this particular class in

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.150
order for a patch it uncle,

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:06.380
to be aware off this we have toe add an annotation are an entry in the web dot xml.

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:07.430
So first,

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:10.130
let's go to the web dot xml and make an entry.

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:13.690
And then we will remove that entry and then add an annotation.

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:14.660
First,

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.200
I goto the XML.

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:23.080
Let's go to the source over here and let's come down after this welcome finalist and then

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.860
adhere one entry for several it.

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:29.780
So I'm gonna go try Pure less than serve lit.

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:33.820
I pressed controlled space and you can see that there is a sublet over here.

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:37.000
This element defines a sublet.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.850
So this is where we do all the configuration related to the separate.

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:46.480
We need to give mandated Lee and name and mention What is the name of the class?

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.050
So I'm gonna go give here some great name.

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:52.290
Let's give it us s one.

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:54.050
It's supposed to be a unique name.

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:55.680
Among other subjects,

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:01.760
the 2nd 1 is the sunlit class on The name of the class is the fully qualified class name,

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:03.490
which is nothing but Korda,

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:06.400
we know dot web dot Hello?

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:12.570
Sell it so you can use command and most over under to see if you get a hyperlink.

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:14.150
If you don't see a hyperlink,

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:17.340
that means you might have made some spell mystic on windows,

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:21.850
use control and then use the most Are Carter on this one.

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:25.900
So these are the two minimum interest that you required.

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:28.530
There are other configuration you can do also.

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:30.760
So with this information dunk,

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:33.990
it will instantly it the solid plus when required.

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:37.300
But in order for a user to access this,

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:38.460
we have to give a U.

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:39.290
R L mapping.

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:42.530
And that is done using a separate tag over here,

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:44.750
which is called sublet Mapping.

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:45.580
Onda,

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:48.630
we need toe map to this particular select.

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:51.720
So now we're gonna refer to this alert with this name called S One.

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.010
And then we say here,

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:58.320
what is the U Ardell pattern for the same the your apartment must to start with there,

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:03.680
slash forward slash and then specify some Ural name.

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.990
So this is something that you have to decide.

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:06.790
What do you want to give.

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:09.650
I would simply give it us Hello on now.

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:15.640
Other subject configuration is really let's form at this XML by pressing command shift F r

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:19.060
control shift F on windows and save the file.

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:19.610
Now,

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:24.000
since the file is saved Andi Tomcatters still running,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.620
You can see that it is started.

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:28.340
Restart the dunk.

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:31.560
It is indicating to you that it has to be restarted.

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:32.920
Let's do one thing.

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:35.590
Let's go wreck Lickle Project on,

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:38.530
then Say run as run on Sarwar.

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:40.910
Since there is some change happen,

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:41.530
so dunk,

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:45.350
It will identify that and then it'll prompt you that.

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:46.880
Do you want to restart the server?

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:47.910
So I'll say yes,

00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:49.300
I want to be started forward.

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:52.150
But I also want Dunkirk to remember my decision.

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:55.650
Which means whenever there is a change in your trained to run the project,

00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:57.670
if Duncan decides to start,

00:07:57.670 --> 00:07:59.990
it'll automatically restart the server.

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:01.950
So we're gonna take on okay.

00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:04.270
And now you will see that dunk.

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:05.390
It is restarted.

00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:07.330
It's gonna go to the home pitch.

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:09.410
But my Ural is Hello.

00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:11.150
So I already have a slash here.

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:14.250
I have to type your hello and then press enter.

00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:18.350
You can see that we got our old put that we produce from the sunlit.

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:21.620
So if I right click on this page on,

00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:23.700
then say view page source,

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:25.910
you will see the only line that I printed,

00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:28.110
which is which one hello world.

00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:29.260
But typically,

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:32.200
HTML file should have HTML head,

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:32.750
body,

00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:33.400
etcetera.

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:37.440
But if I right click on this again and then say inspect,

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:40.890
you'll see that the brother has taken the responsibility off,

00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:45.580
adding HTML head body and inside the body we have the hello Ward.

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:48.290
So generally it's not a good practice toe.

00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:50.370
Leave it to the browser toe at all this stuff,

00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:54.250
so we have to produce the required HTML output.

00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:57.250
But as you might probably notice,

00:08:57.250 --> 00:09:01.410
that writing and HTML called in this way is very,

00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:02.410
very difficult.

00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:05.150
And that is where Js peace come into picture.

00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:08.010
We will see J space after a few lectures,

00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:08.990
but for no,

00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:11.340
let's produce the output in this week.

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:16.340
Now that we have seen how to configure as someone in a dot XML,

00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:18.450
let's get it off this section.

00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:20.970
Save it now.

00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:26.460
Dunker is not aware off any solid called Hello separate it just exist in your bill,

00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:27.430
part but dunk.

00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:29.560
It is not going to do anything about this,

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:32.120
whatever the configuration we did in web dot xml,

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:35.100
if you want to do that over here using an addition,

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:42.060
you can just come down toe the class and then out here at the rate Web select that has got

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:43.030
few elements.

00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:45.280
If you press control space over here,

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:51.030
you'll see that there are a lot off elements on the default is nothing but an array off

00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:51.590
strings,

00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:52.940
which is nothing with the U.

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:54.350
R L patterns itself.

00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:58.710
So if you don't have any other additional parameters to be given,

00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:02.840
you simply help to give either a string or an array of string.

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:05.120
So since I want to just get one single value,

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:09.710
I can say you're slash Hello this time let's give us slash.

00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:10.350
Hello,

00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:11.410
Dash world,

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:13.440
Save it once again.

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:13.930
That's right.

00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:17.770
Take on a project and then say run as run on sir.

00:10:17.770 --> 00:10:18.140
Well,

00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:24.070
you'll see that the dunker is restarting by itself and then comes to the homepage.

00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:26.050
If I type your slash hello,

00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:27.870
it will be for naught,

00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:30.910
for which means the resources,

00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:31.620
not phone.

00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:35.560
But if I type here Hello Dash World Press enter,

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:39.200
you can see that you get the same or put as the previous one.

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:40.680
So from no one works.

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:46.350
We will be using the annotation method off configuring a sublet insel off examine.

00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:49.130
But wherever XML configuration is required,

00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:52.250
I will come back and explain the same thing also.

00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:55.480
So that's all for this lecture in the next litter.

00:10:55.480 --> 00:11:02.010
Let's see how to pass parameters from the HTML file and then process the same thing over

00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:02.450
here.
