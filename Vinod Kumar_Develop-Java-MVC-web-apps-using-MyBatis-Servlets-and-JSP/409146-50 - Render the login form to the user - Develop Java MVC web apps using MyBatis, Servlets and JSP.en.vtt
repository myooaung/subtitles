00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.840
in the next couple of lectures.

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:04.740
Let's implement the log in and lager feature.

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:05.890
As of now,

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:08.220
before I click on the log in Link over Here,

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.910
I'm gonna get for not for because we don't have any separate corresponding toe this year,

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:15.390
and what we want is when I click on this,

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:21.810
I want to have an it's female form here so I can enter my email and password and try to log

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.160
in in this lecture.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.560
Let's create a submarine and JSP combination so that when I click on this logging,

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.560
I get an HTML form here to do so.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.780
Let's go back to our eclipse notice.

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:40.310
Here we have the head chef in the header that corresponds to a Ural called Slash logging.

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:42.700
We don't have a sunlit corresponding to that.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:49.970
That's why we got the former for Let's create a new sunlit under the package called Logging

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:50.550
Tablet.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.800
So it's gonna be a new plus name of the class is gonna be log in.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.950
Separate Super class is going to be http starlet.

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:00.690
Let's click OK,

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.810
finish are the Ural pattern in the Web,

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:10.470
several it an addition inboard it that altered the default solution.

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.330
You ready for this service class.

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:14.550
Get it off the comment.

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:15.850
Let's added,

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.920
Do get by prison controlled space and start typing Dogg.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.610
And let's get it off these two lines.

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:23.290
There are two tasks here.

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.680
Number one is to check if the U there has already loved him.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.210
If the answer is yes,

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:29.300
let's read it.

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.780
The user to their dashboard.

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.150
Number two is if the user has not loved in render the log in form.

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:40.050
The first task is done by checking decision for the user objects.

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:41.040
I'm going to say here,

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.590
User user equals two recruits don't get session.

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:46.980
And from the station,

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:53.260
we want to say get attribute called User User needs to be imported from our entity package

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.380
And we also may need the casting.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:02.090
Now if this user is not equals toe know that means the user has only loved being.

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:03.810
That's why it is there in the fission.

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:10.300
We simply have to say respite art Send redirect toe dot slash dash board.

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.140
So this is gonna be a claim safety direction and obviously in the dashboard.

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.410
Also,

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.790
we're gonna check if the user has logged in or not.

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.250
If the user has not logged in.

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.620
Obviously,

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.370
it's going to go to the lung inform Let's also had a written statement.

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.260
And if the user has not loved being,

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.050
all we have to do is to say,

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:36.230
Request our get request dispatcher slash November in f slash views slash logging dark gsp

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.000
dot forward requesting response.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.380
We don't have this JSP yet,

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:42.820
so we need to create one.

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.010
Let's copy this name on,

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.360
then come to the views.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.250
Right Click New jsp.

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.720
Fine,

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:50.520
yes,

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:51.770
the name press enter.

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:59.220
Let's get it off the court inside that Andi I'm the header and footer percentage at include

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.690
finally call store dot slash header dark ESPN.

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.080
Close the bracket.

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.090
Copy and paste change this two footer.

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:13.130
Let's add a hit three with the existing users.

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:17.900
Please log in here and then at a hitcher,

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.240
we need a form that submits the user name and password in our kids.

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.780
It's going to be email and password to the log in separate,

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.910
so we're gonna go and type your form.

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.140
Action equals to either an empty string or don't give the action at all.

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:33.780
Method is important.

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.970
Let's give the matter as post and then slash form,

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.530
just like the registration form.

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.560
We can have a label in textbooks for each of the fields.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.700
So I'm gonna copy from the registered or GSP.

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.410
Let's a dissection.

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.670
This is the one for email.

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:52.080
I need that over here.

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.600
And then one for password,

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.650
copy and paste over here.

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.550
That's also copy those submit button over here.

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:02.310
But it said register.

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:03.090
But in this case,

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:03.740
we have to say,

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:04.310
Log in,

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.160
come back and based over here and then changes toe logging.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.450
Let's former it and save it.

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:11.530
Let's go on.

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.350
Right Click on the project.

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.260
Run as run on,

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:15.490
sir.

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.740
Where?

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:22.180
And let's click the log in button and see that we get the log in form.

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.830
Here it is existing you this please log in here with an email address and password.

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:28.330
And there is the log in button.

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:29.050
Of course,

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:30.150
if I click on this now,

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.310
I'm gonna get a 405 error,

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:37.820
mainly because this is a post submission to the logging tablet and in the log in several.

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:39.170
We don't have the do post.

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:40.260
Let's give it a try.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:41.950
Com log in and you see,

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:43.580
we got the 40 fight.

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:49.790
Method not alone mattered here is the http post emitter which is not supported by the

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:55.480
actual separate in the next little let's add a new post matter in our log in tablet,

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:59.990
which is ableto handle the post submission from the lug inform.
