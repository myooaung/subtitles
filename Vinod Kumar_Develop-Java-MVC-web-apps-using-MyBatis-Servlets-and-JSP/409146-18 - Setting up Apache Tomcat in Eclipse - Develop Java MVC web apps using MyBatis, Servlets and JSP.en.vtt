00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.020
in this lecture.

00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:06.860
Let's see how to download Apache Tomcat nine and then configure the same thing in Eclipse

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:11.310
so that we can start and stop dunk it from within Eclipse.

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:12.410
To do so.

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.150
Let's open a browser and search for Apache Dunk it.

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:22.530
Nine Download and usually the 1st 1 is the correct one.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:29.540
So let's go over there as you can see here that we have different binary distributions and

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:32.820
the one that we want is this core zip file.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.100
Let's click on that to download Onda.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.850
Let me save it on desktop.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.580
It's around 11 a.m. B.

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.560
Once the download is complete,

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.570
let's unzip the same thing and then the zip file.

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:47.710
We don't need it anymore,

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:48.010
so I'm,

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:48.300
you know,

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.720
just to deliver the same thing.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.040
Let's go toe eclipse now.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.830
So I have already created a brand new workspace called Training Word Space,

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:58.250
and this is on my desktop.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.120
And because we are in the Java E perspective,

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.370
we can see here Project Explorer,

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.690
the outline and task views on the right side and at the bottom.

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:08.760
We have markers,

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:09.580
properties,

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:10.620
servers,

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:11.250
etcetera,

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.420
Andi.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.910
The Star Wars is where we have to configure Apache Tomcat.

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:17.600
Currently a test?

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:18.030
No,

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:18.270
sir.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.190
Words are available.

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.180
Click this link to create a new server.

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.770
If you're not seeing this particular servers view,

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.950
probably because you're not in the job I e perspective.

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.190
We can go the window perspective.

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:31.700
Open perspective.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:32.720
Other.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.650
Make sure that you have selected Java E,

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.420
which is the default as you can see and take on open.

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.180
And in case if you have closed it and you want to reopen the same thing,

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.390
you can again goto window,

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.180
show you and you can see there is servers.

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:50.810
And if you're not seeing that over here,

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.930
you can go to other and then search for survivors.

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.330
Let's click on this link here that says no servers are available.

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.150
Click this link to create a new server,

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.960
and then it shows a bunch off servers that you can configure over here.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.770
Number one is the Apache.

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.950
That's expand that under a part.

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.010
You can see there are various Tom kits that are available,

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:13.410
and the one that we downloaded its Apache Tomcat.

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.850
Nine.

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:14.530
So,

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:15.150
like that,

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.150
live this toe default.

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:18.050
Click next.

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:24.770
The name is just a name that appears in this list over here the Apache Tomcat installation

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:25.900
directory is important.

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.200
So if you give a wrong directly,

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.750
or if there is a stallion state,

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.400
then you will not be able to proceed for their that take on brows.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.520
I have to go toe my desktop where I have just unzip the downloaded file.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.030
So I take on the party time.

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.260
Good nine say open and now you see there is no other.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.640
That is the next button.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:46.550
There's the finish button.

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:48.630
But in case if I make some small mistake,

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:49.160
for example,

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.380
if I type here you can see I get another the specified Tomcat installation.

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.310
The victory does not exist as well as next and finish button are disabled,

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.850
so make sure that you have selected the right directory.

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:02.460
Click the next button,

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:04.080
your eggs asking.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.340
Is there any project that you want to deploy it on?

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.900
Tomcat?

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:07.180
On?

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.860
Since the brand new work spirit,

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.210
I don't have any project.

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:11.760
Even if I had projects,

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.900
they have to be Web projects.

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.840
Then only this possible to be deployed on Tomcat.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.120
I don't have any,

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.060
so let's click finish to come off that by default.

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.770
This Apache hunkered runs on 8080 port.

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:27.520
How about if you want to change any of those settings,

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:33.040
you can just double click this and then a configuration file opens in the form of joy.

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.350
As you can see,

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.430
there are a few options that you may think off.

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.100
Number one is the port number here,

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.140
the it's TDP wondered.

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.810
One port number is 8080 So this is where you can change this to something else.

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:50.440
In case if you have something else running on a job,

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.870
a job,

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.350
sometimes when you're on your server,

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:55.290
it might take more time than usual.

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.400
If you ever come across with the time out,

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.160
better you can come here and then give a different number.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.100
Usually a bigger number,

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.830
like 10 times like 4 50 on 1 50 is okay.

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:12.900
Another point that you may probably would like toa keep in mind is where exactly the server

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.140
is going toe run from No notice that my server is on desktop.

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:23.400
However you can see the location of the somewhere is going to be your workspace.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:28.220
That means for all the projects that you're running so they will be kept under workspace.

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:33.450
Meta data folder so original Tomcat installation directory is untouched.

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:34.520
There is a second option,

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.870
it says.

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:35.660
Use the dunker.

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.510
Installation takes control off the actual dunker installation that's going on.

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:43.920
That means any changes that you make over here will affect the one on the desktop.

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.880
The third option is to use a custom location.

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.980
It doesn't affect the Tomcat installation on desktop as well as it doesn't affect the

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:52.740
workspace.

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.780
You may have to give your own location,

00:04:54.780 --> 00:05:00.520
so I'm gonna just leave it toe the workspace meta data folder another option that you can

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.990
see here that says Models auto reload by default.

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.220
That means whenever you will save your files,

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.820
the files get reloaded automatically within the server,

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:14.000
and the options for publishing are never published automatically.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.290
That means you may have to publish every time you make them change,

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:21.360
but the difference is automatically publish when resources changed.

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:22.280
That's what we want.

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.550
So we saved the files and it should automatically publish,

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:29.710
and the tournament is automatically published at a build event.

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:32.750
Eclipse decides when the build event takes place.

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:33.750
Also,

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:40.150
the publishing into away in seconds is one that means whenever you make some changes to the

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:45.130
file and save from that time to the next one second it might actually published.

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:46.670
So that's what actually it says.

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:47.060
So.

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:50.370
These are some of the settings that you might want toe have a look it.

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:52.300
Let's see if we can run.

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.710
Our tomcats are work without any problems.

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:55.520
So to do that,

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:56.050
that's right.

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:03.240
Take on this entry over here and then say Start when you're on your dunk it within a couple

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:03.790
of seconds,

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:08.990
you will see that it comes up If I go to the console here it says that the server started

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:15.030
in 682 minutes against less than a second as well as you can see that the starting their

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:16.000
political handlers,

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.560
it's DDP Dash and I 0-80 is zero.

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.580
So that's the indication of the port number.

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:28.570
So if I go back to a browser and then open local host 800 you should know,

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:35.650
see that there is an error message that's coming from Apache Tonka 9.0 point 34 The other

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:38.680
message is because we don't have any products deployed.

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:39.270
However,

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:44.460
this indicates that our configuration is successfully done and surgery is up and running

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:45.400
without a problem.

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:47.100
Let's go back to Eclipse.

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:49.300
Whenever you run out of that project,

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:53.400
the project will be deployed onto this particular Tom Kitt.

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.240
If Restarted required,

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:56.250
it's going to do that.

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:57.410
But after that,

00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:00.380
it opens a browser within the eclipse.

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:03.920
Visit the local host agia it zero slash water.

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:05.760
The Projects Context Route is there.

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:06.510
However,

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:11.400
if I want the external browser Toby Used Instructor Internet browser.

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:19.140
We can choose this option by going Toe Window Web browser and then select default system.

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:19.260
Where.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:19.780
Broza.

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:22.130
If you have multiple browsers,

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:24.380
install after you install Eclipse,

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:26.610
even they would be lifted over here.

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:30.170
If you want to add another brother manually on Windows,

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:34.270
you can go to a window and there'll be a preferences option at the bottom.

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:38.050
On Mac OS we have under eclipse but,

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:38.080
uh,

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:41.210
friends this and then look for browser.

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:47.560
You'll see that there is a general of Ambrose are there is only D Fort system,

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:48.060
where brother,

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:53.560
you can click on new and then specify the name of the browser on the location of the

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:54.080
browser.

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:54.890
At this time,

00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:56.760
I don't want to do any of these things,

00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:59.150
but if you have a browser and it's not listed.

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:04.100
You can always given name here and then select the location of the executable file and then

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:04.990
take on okay,

00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:08.180
to come off this in order to stop the server,

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:14.210
you can right click on the server and you can click on Stop are if you have clicked on this

00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:14.210
,

00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:16.870
use E stop button over here as well.

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:20.010
These two options gracefully stopped the server.

00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:23.420
But if you go to the console and then click on stop here,

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:28.110
this is as if you exit the jbm without proper shirt.

00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:28.400
Don't.

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:29.470
Either way,

00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:30.580
the sir,

00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:31.800
where is going to stop?

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:33.650
So I'll take on this toe,

00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:37.570
terminate the Jeriome itself and instantly it stops the server.

00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:39.280
That's all for this lecture.

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:40.400
In the next lecture,

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:46.370
let's create a new maven project and deploy the same thing on this particular server.
