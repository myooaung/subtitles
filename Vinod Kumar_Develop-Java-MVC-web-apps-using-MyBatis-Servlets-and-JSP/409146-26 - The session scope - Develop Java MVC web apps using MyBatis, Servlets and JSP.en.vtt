00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
in order to meet any user later across multiple user visits.

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:05.130
In other words,

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:06.800
multiple user requests.

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:11.490
We make himself an object off an interface called http session.

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.330
So it is an interface,

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:19.350
but the actual object is created by Tomcat are which over the Web server that you're using

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:19.350
.

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.210
So they're supposed to give me an object off its GDP session to understand the same thing.

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.780
Let's take an example where as a user,

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:29.530
I want toe enter a name off my friend,

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:31.400
and that has to be stored in the server,

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.250
and I should be able to enter another name and that also should be stored in the server.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.130
And they should continuously happen.

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:41.150
And I should also be ableto view the names that I've already added.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:42.340
So let's get started.

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:43.910
Let's clear that each team will first,

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:44.800
let's call it us.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.790
Add name dot html.

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:48.870
So I'm gonna create a new It's female file here.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.530
I'll call it us our name dot each demon.

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.760
I click on finish to come out of this.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:03.550
It's also are here a title as http session demo that make you the same thing as Hitch one

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:08.850
over here and then probably HR horizontal rule,

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.350
and then I form where actually calls toe.

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:13.300
Let's call it us.

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:14.820
Add dash name.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:15.930
That's all I want to give.

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.140
It could be at name,

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.620
separate or whatever on the method.

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.240
Also can be anything,

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.090
but let's give it as get for now.

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.610
We don't have to really where they would the post at this time.

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.030
Let's add a text label over here.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:33.450
Will they enter a friend's name and we give a text box?

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.150
Input type equals toe text.

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.450
Name equals two.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.710
Let's type it us friend Underscore name.

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:41.910
You can give any other name.

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:44.810
If you feel like I think they should be good enough for this,

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.530
let's close this and then I'm gonna probably button for submit.

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.450
It's a button slash button by default button explicates submit button and then here I'm

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.370
gonna take your ad name.

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.290
That's all I want to give nothing else.

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:04.580
We can also provide a hyperlink over here toe view all the names that I already enter,

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.480
so I'm gonna type your let's a do on inside the deal I want to.

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:10.800
Probably a head chef equals two,

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.900
and then I'll type your view names included because there may be.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.020
Multiple names are zero also,

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.500
and I'm going to take your view names.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.350
Save it.

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:26.280
So let's take a look at how this is gonna look like I'm no rightly run as on server,

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.080
so I can type in a name and then click on this button toe.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.950
Add the name.

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.780
I can also click on this toe.

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:33.450
View the names.

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:33.970
But of course,

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.470
both these tablets don't exist at this point in time,

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.780
so it's only going toe produce editors.

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.400
So let's go back toe clips and create a sublet,

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.530
which has this ad dash name as the Ural Pattern.

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.670
So let's go back to our package.

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:54.750
Right click New Class on this is going to be called as add name sublet.

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.360
This is also going tohave http sublet as the super plants.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.180
It comes over here so that the 1st 1 say,

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.880
Okay,

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.420
click on finish Andi.

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:06.270
First thing first,

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.690
let's add the Great Web Summit,

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.440
and then the pattern is at dash name.

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:12.610
That's what we have given.

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.300
That's also at a default cereal washing your I d.

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:21.480
Get it off the comment and then we want toe are the do get function by pressing control

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:22.060
space,

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.070
D o g.

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:28.050
And we get that do get function over here on Let's get off these two lines as well.

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:34.170
So the first thing that we want to do here is toe get the name entered by the user.

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.440
So that's what we want to get that from this request object on if you remember.

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.330
So the textbooks has a name called Friend Underscore.

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.010
Name that the perimeter.

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.300
Once again,

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:52.170
we can always say string that a friend Name equals toe Request our get perimeter off,

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:58.300
friend underscore Name In case if this is not all even an empty string.

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.920
For example,

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.780
if the user has not filled in any value over here,

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:02.740
for example,

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:04.860
you ve told feeling if I click on this button,

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.490
I don't want that to be accepted as valid names.

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:13.750
I don't want blank names to be added into my collection So I can always check your if

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:20.210
friend the name is equals to know are you can say friend,

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:27.110
the name dot Lent maybe after trimming If the length happens to be zero,

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.760
then we will simply redirect that back to the HTML.

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:31.910
So we know how this works.

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:32.920
Let me full screen.

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:33.280
This,

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.700
I'm gonna say Respite art.

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.100
Send redirect,

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:43.070
too dark slash Add name dot html That's where it's supposed to go back to.

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:48.320
And then I'll say return because we don't have anything else to go after redirection.

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.790
But if the name is a valid name,

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:54.030
that the user is entered doesn't matter what it is,

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:54.990
but it is Enter.

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:59.780
Now we want to store that in the school for a given user,

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.260
there may be a session that may not be a session by before.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.650
There is no session object created automatically.

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:05.950
But if you have one,

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:07.050
we want to get through that.

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:08.090
And if I don't have one,

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:09.300
I want to create a new one.

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:14.860
So this is where request dot get session function helps us.

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.420
You can see there are two Williams.

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:19.170
The 1st 1 doesn't take any perimeter.

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:23.680
This checks whether the user is associated with the fission or not.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.320
If the answer is no,

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.350
then a new session is returned over here.

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:30.190
But if the user is already associated with the session,

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:34.500
then the existing session object will be retrieved and will be given to me.

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.240
The 2nd 1 is,

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:36.840
of course,

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:40.540
allows us to say if the user is not associated with decision.

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:44.000
No need to create a new one so we can say your false.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.060
So let us send this to a variable called session.

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:47.560
Andi,

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:51.750
we're going toe press Command one or control one on windows to get this object.

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:53.980
So we now have a session.

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:59.250
This may be a brand new station are it May be an already existing session.

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:03.210
So assuming that you're visiting this particular subject for the first time.

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:05.500
So obviously this is a brand new session.

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:09.750
But imagine I'm typing in a second name and told him and forth name.

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:11.550
Every time I'm clicking on this ad name,

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:13.270
I'm coming back over here.

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:16.150
So the second time decision already exists.

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:16.880
I wonder.

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:17.920
Check hit.

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:21.450
Do I have a collection off names already in that.

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:27.980
So let's declare a variable representing the list off names and there s a list off string

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:34.070
called names equals tow session dot Get attribute off.

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:36.050
Let's call it us name list.

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:36.750
No,

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:36.880
no,

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.130
it is that this is going to be an editor.

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:39.560
Of course,

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:40.550
the first batteries,

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:45.400
because I'm not imported this I'm going put this from the util package for the second error

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:49.580
is because the return value off this get attribute is an object.

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:50.790
It's a super type,

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:53.850
and I'm tryingto fortunately assigned to a subtype.

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:56.310
So this down casting has to be explicit.

00:06:56.310 --> 00:07:02.150
So I have to press command one or controlling on Windows Onda at the cast.

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:03.190
So again,

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:06.070
let's assume that they're submitting for the first time,

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:06.890
obviously,

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:08.630
when you receive it for the first time.

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:13.090
This is a brand new session object which doesn't contain any attributes at all.

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:16.080
So when you say give me the attribute called name list,

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:19.750
it only returns now and we have assigned null toe this.

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:20.700
So this is,

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:21.100
ah,

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:24.040
condition that indicates that you visiting this for the first time.

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:26.700
Saltier If names equals toe.

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:27.230
No,

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:30.840
Denel say names equals toe Knew our A list.

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:31.290
Let's,

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:31.850
uh,

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:33.450
imported from Java Util.

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:39.030
And now I'm going to store the name entered by the user in this names,

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:45.060
so I'll type your names dot r and then type your friend the name and that's the first name

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:45.770
that I marry.

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:51.430
And now I'm going to store this in the session as an attributes on cessation DOT said

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:55.950
attribute called name list and then I'll say your names.

00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:57.780
So which means,

00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:01.510
if you are visiting this predicts alert for the first time,

00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:07.080
we are now creating a new analyst and storing the same thing in the session.

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:08.240
Scope on.

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:08.930
Also,

00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:12.950
the new earliest contains the first name that I've added.

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:14.000
However,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.750
if you're visiting it for the second time onwards,

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:20.090
then this is no longer an new session.

00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:25.150
Object on Decision Object already contains the Nameless because in the first attempt,

00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:29.220
we ourselves stored the name list as an attribute.

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:30.230
So obviously,

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:32.110
in the second request on words,

00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:33.740
that is the one that is going to be the tree.

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:35.700
So it is not know.

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:37.200
So now I have a choice here,

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:38.430
so I can say else.

00:08:38.430 --> 00:08:41.570
So that means it's the second request onwards,

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:45.330
names that represents the adult list that already exists.

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:48.880
I'm simply going to type names dot ad and then I say,

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:49.650
friendly name.

00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:51.680
If you observe carefully,

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:54.490
this names dot our friend name is a common factor here,

00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:57.250
so which means I don't have to really put that conditionally.

00:08:57.250 --> 00:09:03.150
I can put that separately over here on Get off that from this place.

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:06.030
So if it's a first to request.

00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:09.220
We're creating a brand new released and storing it in the session.

00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:11.370
But if it's a second request onwards,

00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:12.380
we are all we got.

00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:17.550
The old released and then we're simply adding the name in both the cases.

00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:22.250
So once the name has been added to the other list and kept in the session scope,

00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:22.570
well,

00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:23.720
simply tell the user that,

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:23.890
Hey,

00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:25.630
your name has been successfully added.

00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:26.720
So let's go on,

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:27.520
do the same thing.

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:34.150
I'm gonna type your respite are set content type off text slash its demon.

00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:36.920
That's a good practice to be followed all the times on.

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:43.830
Then I'll say here out equals toe respite art get writer on out needs to be created as a

00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:44.150
print.

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:45.500
Reiter Also,

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:49.000
I'm going to include the ad named our HTML here.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.540
So I'm gonna say request,

00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:56.140
don't get request dispatcher add named doll html and stayed away.

00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:57.700
I can say dot Include,

00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:02.540
I'm doing a statement chaining over here request on then response.

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:06.450
So this ensures that the adn image stimulus included,

00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:07.970
and then we'll also give a message.

00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:12.570
You're saying hits three on the name given by the user,

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:18.050
which is friendly name is added to your friend list.

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:22.010
That's also close the output stream.

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:24.710
So let's goto our name dot html.

00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:31.630
Right click run as Run on Sarwar and let's go to the browser.

00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:34.120
We got this form over here.

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:35.390
I'm gonna type in a name.

00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:37.380
Let's say I'm gonna take your sham.

00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:38.980
I click on add name.

00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:40.290
When I click on add name,

00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:46.130
it goes to the ad name Summit because if the first request a brand new session is created

00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:49.270
because the brand new station doesn't contain in our released,

00:10:49.270 --> 00:10:50.810
a new other list is created.

00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:52.500
Charm is stored in the realist.

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:54.050
Other list is stored in the fission.

00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:55.630
Then I come back over here.

00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:56.740
So it says here,

00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:59.290
Sham added toe your friend list.

00:10:59.290 --> 00:11:00.720
If I simply click on days,

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:03.500
you can see that it's simply redirecting back to the ADN image.

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:03.830
Tamil.

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:05.650
It's not giving any other.

00:11:05.650 --> 00:11:07.150
That's our one more name.

00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:07.450
Let's say,

00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:08.050
for example,

00:11:08.050 --> 00:11:08.630
James.

00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:09.690
Click on Add name.

00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:10.090
So it is,

00:11:10.090 --> 00:11:10.970
James added,

00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:12.950
Let's say you're John.

00:11:12.950 --> 00:11:16.480
I've named John added to your friend list.

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:17.940
So at this time,

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:20.150
three names have been added to the other list,

00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:22.350
and the other early states kept in the session scope.

00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:25.640
I don't have a sublet toe view the names yet,

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:27.470
but let's go and create the same thing.

00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:29.960
So I'm gonna go back to my package over here.

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:32.920
So let's call this as view names Sollett.

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:36.950
So I create a new plus view names sublet.

00:11:36.950 --> 00:11:39.990
That's a super class off.

00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:44.200
Http Summit Click on finish.

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:49.460
Let's give a Web summit on tradition on the Web.

00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:51.960
Sell An addition has to have a urine Patton,

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:55.250
which is nothing but what we have given here as view.

00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:56.450
Dash names.

00:11:56.450 --> 00:11:59.930
So let's give the same thing over here at De Fort Cereal.

00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:00.960
Wish a new I d.

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:05.550
Get it off this comment that's also over the do get this time.

00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:06.990
I'll goto source menu.

00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:08.140
Alright,

00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:11.560
implement methods and then I select your do get.

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:12.750
That's the one that I want.

00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:14.730
Let's all write the same thing.

00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:17.370
Get it off these two core on.

00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:22.110
The only thing that this is supposed to do is tow it through the session object and from

00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:27.010
decision objectively supposed to get the analyst on Fonda relisted supposed toe literate

00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:31.010
over all the names and then printed in the form of probably bulleted text.

00:12:31.010 --> 00:12:37.780
So let's give a variable called station equals toe request dot Get session and then say

00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:43.670
control one or command one on Mac OS and we got the It's too deep recession variable from

00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:43.930
here.

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:46.820
We're gonna get the list off names,

00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:48.420
which is not the murder list off string.

00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:49.650
Let's call it as names.

00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:52.130
This time equals tow session.

00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:57.680
Don't get attribute and we have to get the same attribute that be store over here,

00:12:57.680 --> 00:12:59.550
which is called name List.

00:12:59.550 --> 00:13:05.170
So because this is the active duty that is present in the session scope on the same thing

00:13:05.170 --> 00:13:06.830
we have to give because if you give something else,

00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:11.280
then it to say it is not fun and it's going to return all on the list in its to be

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:13.010
important from Java Util.

00:13:13.010 --> 00:13:15.400
And of course I have to do a cast.

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:20.050
Let's add a cast or here this is where I can check if names is now.

00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:21.530
I simply have to tell their Hey,

00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:24.260
you don't have any names in your list.

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:27.720
So I'm gonna say if names equals toe No,

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:29.450
because it's not present.

00:13:29.450 --> 00:13:32.090
You can also say if names equals TUNEL.

00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:35.660
Our names dot size equals 20 For example,

00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:36.730
you have a session,

00:13:36.730 --> 00:13:38.290
you have a name list,

00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:39.760
but there are no names in that.

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:41.950
So there's no point in looping over,

00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:44.750
so we can always check your if names equals to none.

00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:51.680
Our names dot size equals 20 Then I can probably produce an output that is,

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:55.690
there are no names in your collection before that.

00:13:55.690 --> 00:13:56.700
Let's adhere.

00:13:56.700 --> 00:14:01.670
Respite Art Set content type aan den texter slash its demon.

00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:03.260
That's the mime type.

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:06.500
And then we say You're out equals toe respite out,

00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:11.940
get writer and then out is supposed to be created off type print writer.

00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:15.490
Let's give a message over here out dot print Ellen,

00:14:15.490 --> 00:14:21.850
maybe Hedge tree and say there are no names in your friend list.

00:14:21.850 --> 00:14:25.250
Let's say slash history.

00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:32.020
But if names exist and its size is not equal to zero obviously is greater than zero.

00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:33.740
We want to display a message.

00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:35.150
Here are the friends,

00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:38.820
so I'll tell you how dark brindle and maybe hit three.

00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:44.270
I'll say this are your friends and probably slash history.

00:14:44.270 --> 00:14:53.360
Let's give a loop here for string name in names because names a list I can it right over

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:53.960
like that.

00:14:53.960 --> 00:15:03.560
And then I did hear older Prindle and probably L I plus name plus slashed alive L.

00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:06.700
A has to be inside a u l or oil.

00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:13.960
So I'm gonna go give your out dark brindle in that a union on order list on the same thing

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:14.710
after this,

00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:16.520
but with slash.

00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:18.070
Once you produce the output,

00:15:18.070 --> 00:15:22.040
let's also say how dot clothes save this.

00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:24.560
Maybe restart Apache.

00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:26.100
Don't get manually.

00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:30.480
Go back to the browser on.

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:33.800
Let's see if we can view our names over here.

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:34.980
You continue this.

00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:37.070
These are your friends.

00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:39.930
I forgot to include the ad names are extremely well.

00:15:39.930 --> 00:15:41.840
That part I can copy from here.

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:44.540
So we do have that or here.

00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:46.000
A copy on,

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.380
then Based Probably right after this.

00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:50.250
Save it.

00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:52.650
But we start dunk it once more.

00:15:52.650 --> 00:15:54.720
I think it's automatically reloaded this time.

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:56.450
I'm gonna go back over here.

00:15:56.450 --> 00:15:58.570
Click on view Names on now.

00:15:58.570 --> 00:15:59.380
You can see it.

00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:01.050
Prints right inside that.

00:16:01.050 --> 00:16:07.840
So if I open a new window probably a new incognito window on,

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:11.030
then probably copy this.

00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:13.940
U R l let I'm going to copy this year or early on.

00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:16.340
Then go back to the incognito window.

00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:18.750
Based it and press enter.

00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:22.600
You can see that it is that are no names in your friend list,

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:26.460
because this browser is considered as a different user.

00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:32.380
Whatever the names I adhere are maintained in the session for this particular user.

00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:34.580
So there are two users to sessions.

00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:35.790
If there are 200 users,

00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:37.090
there'll be 200 sessions.

00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:39.150
So I'm gonna add a different name here.

00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:39.580
Let's say,

00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:40.460
for example,

00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:41.880
Ramesh,

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:43.100
I press enter.

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:44.110
It is added.

00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:45.930
That's also our hearsay.

00:16:45.930 --> 00:16:47.300
Ravi was entered.

00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:49.080
I'm gonna add one more.

00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:52.200
That's a Cuban and press enter.

00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:54.180
We have three names over here.

00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:57.060
You can see these are the three different names on the names.

00:16:57.060 --> 00:16:58.580
Here are still the same thing.

00:16:58.580 --> 00:16:59.890
So if I add one more name,

00:16:59.890 --> 00:17:00.680
for example,

00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:02.740
that's a key sure press center.

00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:08.740
You can see that the names are different in both the browsers because they're different

00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:09.930
clients altogether.

00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:13.020
So this is all hits TTP session works.

00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:19.750
The data maintained by the its duty position is available for multiple user visits.

00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:21.950
Why are multiple requests?

00:17:21.950 --> 00:17:27.200
One of the biggest challenge face here is that as the number of users grow,

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:27.870
for example,

00:17:27.870 --> 00:17:29.040
if you have to users,

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:32.780
you have to station objects 200 years as you have 200 session objects.

00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:35.130
But imagine applications like Fish Book,

00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:38.140
where there are millions of users currently logged in tow.

00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:39.030
Facebook's our work.

00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:43.590
You can probably expect to have millions off session objects on the server side.

00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:45.430
So in the modern applications,

00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:48.310
we generally a wide using sessions.

00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:50.820
But for small to medium scale application,

00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:54.750
this is a view maintained user later across multiple visits.
