00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.150
in this lecture,

00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:06.030
let's read the do post function that is capable of handling this form submission.

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:13.870
So let's go to the log in separate and either do post function here by typing control space

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:13.870
,

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:14.330
D,

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.570
O.

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:15.080
P.

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.200
And then enter in the do post function.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.050
The very first thing that we're gonna do is to say Request,

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.760
don't get perimeter off email.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:25.970
That's the user name.

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.740
Let's assign this to a variable called email.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.480
Andi email should be declared as a string,

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:32.700
and similarly,

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.330
I can also say password equals toe request start get perimeter off password.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.120
Once the inputs have been collected,

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.350
the controller is supposed to make us offer appropriate service function,

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.330
pass on these values and then collect the model data.

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.620
Since we're dealing with the users,

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.050
we have to make use of the user service.

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:58.070
So lets a user service surveys equals toe new user service.

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:05.810
And then we will call a non existing function over here by supplying email password on a

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:06.750
map object.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.290
Let's get the map object.

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:14.800
First stream is the key On a string is the values genotype that's called it as others

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.220
equals toe new Hashmat.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:25.590
Hashmat also has the same data type an import map from you till let's assume that the

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:33.160
service has a function called log in that takes email possible for Andi editors as

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.980
Parameters,

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.750
which returns a user object.

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:37.980
Notice.

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.710
We don't have a function like that in our surveys,

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.860
and that's the reason why eclipses giving an error over here.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.760
And if I move the cursor on there it is.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.270
The method log in,

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.760
which takes string string on a map,

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.140
is undefined for the type user service.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.060
But we're also assuming that the user object.

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.850
So now Eclipse can help us create a function in the user service.

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.360
So if I select the first option here,

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.930
it has cleared method called Log in with thorns of parameters in the type you that service

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.930
.

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:09.100
If I select the option,

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.850
you can see that in the user service class,

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:13.360
it has added a function,

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.370
which is public returned.

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:16.350
Type is user.

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.010
Name of the function is log in,

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.750
and it takes email password on errors as parameters for the timing,

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.030
it's returning none.

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.200
Let's leave that be.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.350
Let's come back to our log in summit,

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:28.970
and obviously there's no address.

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:35.650
So once this function is implemented If it has returned a user object that mean if user is

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:36.740
not equal to know,

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.970
that means it is a valid user.

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:45.770
In case if the user is no are the size of this address map is greater than zero.

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:50.110
That means that our validation errors we just have to redirect the user back to the log in

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.810
our jsp.

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.320
So let's do that first by chicken.

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.250
If errors dot size is greater than zero,

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.280
we just have toe go back to the JSP.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.770
So I'm gonna copy this line and then paste over here.

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:05.430
But before going,

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.410
we also have to store this errors in the request cope.

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:15.850
So let's do that by typing request are set attribute at us on it us so that in the log

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.540
indoor JCB we can make use off this errors.

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:19.020
In fact,

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.170
if you will see the log indoor jsp,

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:26.550
we have already medios off that here is where we're displaying the enter start email and

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:33.250
other start passer Let's come back to the summit in case if size is not greater than zero

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:39.230
that means there are no others We can simply say here yells We have to store this user

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.200
object indecision and then redirect the user to the dashboard.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.020
For that,

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:48.620
I'm gonna say request our get session dot Set.

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.320
Attribute the name of the activity.

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.230
I want to keep it as user because even in the register,

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:55.670
some would We have done the same thing.

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.930
It has to be common across all your application component.

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.880
The value also is gonna be the user object that we obtained over here.

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.940
And then I have toe redirect the user,

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:08.110
toe the dashboard.

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:10.870
So I'm gonna copy this line and then paste over here.

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:16.600
Let's say all the fights since dysfunction currently is not implemented,

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:21.720
we will not be ableto check the working off this blue post function in the next lecture.

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.250
Let's implement the log in function in the service and then we will verify the working off

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:27.940
the whole logging module
