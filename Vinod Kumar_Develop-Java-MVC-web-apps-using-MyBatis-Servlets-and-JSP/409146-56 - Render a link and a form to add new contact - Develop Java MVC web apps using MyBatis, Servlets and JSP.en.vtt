00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.140
in this sector.

00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:04.880
Let's provide a link in the header toe are the new contact,

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.750
and that should be available only if the user has loved him.

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:10.050
And when the user clicks on the link,

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.420
we should get an HTML form toe.

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.680
Add a new contact details to do so.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:16.050
First,

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:19.130
let's go to the header Dodgy SPF on.

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.540
This is the location where we have to give all the links that should be available only when

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:24.570
the user has logged in.

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.980
Let's kick your and then press enter.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.750
Let's add a new link.

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:29.410
Hey,

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:29.520
hey,

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.050
teacher equals toe dot slash I conduct.

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:40.240
Let's said the caption ISS eye contact and then I pipe symbol as a separator.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:41.800
Let's say this,

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.900
and if I come back to the browser and then do a quick reload here,

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:50.530
you'll see that we now have a new link for adding a new contract.

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:51.230
However,

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:52.570
if I do log out,

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:54.660
I don't see that link over here.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.570
So the next thing is to create a sublet and map it toe this your own.

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.950
Let's quickly do the same thing by right clicking on the package.

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:05.550
New Plus,

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.210
let's call it us.

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:12.570
Our contact separate super class is http separate.

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.880
Click OK and finish first.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.380
Let's add the VEB.

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:18.750
Separate an addition.

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.890
Map it to the Ural.

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.530
Add contact at the default cereal washing.

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:31.400
You already delete these comments and then I didn't do get and inside the do get let's

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.370
deliver these two lanes on.

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.720
The only thing that I have to do now here is toe forward.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.900
That requested a form which is going to be Let's call it s contact form.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:48.650
I have to say request don't get request dispatcher slash weather in f slash Views slash

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:55.350
contact form dark GSP dart forward Request response.

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.550
This page doesn't exist.

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.410
We now have to clear the new one.

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:01.210
Let's copy this name.

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.200
Go to the views on,

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.280
then face or here press enter.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.550
Let's get it off all the court here but include the header earned foot J SPF.

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:19.180
So I have today less than a percentage at include file equals toe dot,

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.710
slash header Daci,

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:24.410
SPF close it and then copy paste the same thing.

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.280
Make the necessary change,

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.020
which is going to be foot door chase fear.

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:36.820
Let's add a hit three and give a caption as our new contact details on a hitch up.

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.030
If you observe every new jsp that we create,

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.140
we have this content common.

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.160
So what we can do is we can create our own template.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.300
So every time I create a new JSP,

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.810
I can use this template on,

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:50.390
say,

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:51.560
create a new jsp.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:52.540
To do that,

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:59.010
let's copy this whole text and then goto eclipse references for Windows users.

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.390
This option will be under window differences.

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:09.880
So I'm gonna go back to that eclipse preferences and look for template on under the

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:10.530
template.

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.320
You can see that there is a job or a little templates.

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:20.010
If you scroll down under Web JSP files editor templates.

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.610
If I sell it that you can see that there are a lot of templates that are already available

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.610
.

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:29.680
The one that we have been using is JSP with HTML five.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.130
So this is the one that we're using.

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.050
So if you click on it it here,

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:35.990
you'll see that it is new.

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:39.320
Jsp file HTM and five context is new.

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:44.460
Jsp automatically insert and then there is the description and the court corresponding to

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:48.970
that and the cursor will be included in a particular location.

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:50.960
By using this dollar cancer.

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.450
That's important.

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:53.450
Let's click.

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:56.450
Cancel and cleared a new one.

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.010
The name is going to appear in the list,

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:07.130
so I'm gonna type your phone book Js piece and then context is new.

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:11.270
JSP automatically insert description if you want.

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:18.160
You can say include header and footer and then paste What we copied from that contact form

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:23.150
that GSP and I don't need this one But instead I want the cursor to come over there.

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:28.750
So I consider type here dollar concern and close the bracket Say OK,

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.490
applying close.

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:35.870
Let's delete this contact funder JC and recreate the same using this template.

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:43.660
So I'm gonna write like this Contact formed or JCB Delete this Say OK and then Rakic the

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:52.900
views New JSP file Let's give the name as contact form dark GSP Next you can see the one

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:58.740
that be created is listed over here I select this and click on finish on now Our jsp

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:03.620
consists off This I really that concessional come over here somehow it did not come.

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:10.700
That's not body too much about that on let's are the new heading our new contact details.

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:16.790
This is supposed to have an HTML form that takes the control back to the same salary at

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:17.550
context of leg.

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.490
But with a post request matter,

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:20.980
That ad that first.

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:23.060
So I'm gonna say form actually,

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:27.310
co street that an empty sting are no need to give that at all and then say methodical still

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:33.560
posed on inside this I need text boxes representing contact details.

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.650
And if you look at the contact Orjuela,

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:38.070
we have 12 fields here.

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:45.570
Ideas are generated as well as created that can be given like equals toe new date here

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:46.040
itself.

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:49.710
So the remaining is the 10 on all the 10 of them are string.

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:51.980
In this case for each one of them,

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:56.140
we have to create one text box on the label corresponding to that.

00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:01.170
And for that I can make use of the one that we used in the registered or GSP,

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:03.110
and from the registered or JSP.

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:08.660
We can take one off them and then copy and paste in the contact form on Make the necessary

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:09.150
changes.

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:12.620
And the changes is nothing but the caption In this case,

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:14.090
it's the first name.

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:16.350
Input type equals toe text.

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:18.050
Name equals toe.

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:18.850
First name.

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:22.660
I really vehicles to first name or anything else you want,

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:23.270
like F name.

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:25.880
And the same idea is given here for the label.

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:26.550
Also,

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:30.330
this represents one textbooks on.

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:32.950
Now I have to do the same thing for the remaining nine of them.

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:34.510
Since this is a copy,

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:35.540
paste on it,

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:37.590
it I'm gonna pause the video on,

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:38.780
then come back again.

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:43.950
So I have added one textbooks for each one off this.

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:47.530
Let's say all the files notice at contact.

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:47.810
Subtle.

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:50.380
It needs to be authenticated on,

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:51.980
but this is a Ural for the theme.

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:53.140
So let's copy this,

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:53.590
Ural,

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:59.340
and go to the log in check filter and then make another entry over here for the same.

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:03.470
So every time somebody tries toe access,

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:08.370
this particular Ural without logging in it will simply go to the log in page.

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:10.650
So let's go and check the same thing.

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:18.090
If I manually type over here on dash contact and press enter because the filter is in place

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:18.090
,

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:20.730
I'm being redirected to the log in page.

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:21.430
Let's logging.

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:22.680
I'm gonna take your you know,

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:26.550
I've been on dot co password is going to be secret.

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:27.970
That's click log in.

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:30.500
I do have a link here.

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:32.680
Now When I click on this contact,

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:34.510
the enter form is supposed to be shown.

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:39.930
You can see that the text boxes have the same length Thier were over here.

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:41.530
But if you want to customize saying,

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:42.110
for example,

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:42.890
for first name,

00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:45.000
I need only half of these for email,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.730
address and outdoor or the street address.

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:48.790
I want that to be big,

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:51.040
but for city state in cold country,

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:51.950
I went off of them.

00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:57.880
You can control all of them by going and giving the call size for each of the textbooks.

00:07:57.880 --> 00:07:58.850
For example,

00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:01.600
I can go to the contact form the Jsp.

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:04.690
Onda changed this one toe.

00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:07.820
Call em the four instead of eight.

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:09.780
So that's going to be half of its size.

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:13.140
The same thing is going to be done for last name email.

00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:16.510
It just probably lent here phone number again.

00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:17.660
I can say four.

00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:22.770
After being a you are in Let it be full it street address.

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:26.850
Also let it be full with a city state been called headstrong instead,

00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:29.450
off even before I can even say three here,

00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:36.630
and the country also is going to be street.

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:39.430
Let's say all of these on,

00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:42.800
then come back toe our jsp here.

00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:43.870
And then if I reload,

00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:46.350
I should now see the modified washing,

00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:47.390
which looks nice.

00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:54.760
So one small note here is that I have included the deal for admitted for each of the fields

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:54.760
.

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:55.410
Of course,

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:57.270
this is supposed to be forced name,

00:08:57.270 --> 00:09:00.350
and the rest of them have been given properly.

00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:01.340
But remember,

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:03.330
not all of them require validation.

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:04.210
For example,

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:07.970
first name is mandatory and minimum three letters is required.

00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:08.830
But for last name,

00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:10.380
there is no need of any validation.

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:12.800
Email can be made mandatory,

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:17.360
unique as well as it has to be off appropriate pattern.

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:18.110
Similarly,

00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:19.680
phone number is mandatory.

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:22.510
It has to be unique as well as it has to be only,

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:23.540
for example,

00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:26.090
certain type of digits and characters.

00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:27.900
But for the rest of them,

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:30.530
you probably don't need to do any validation,

00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:30.900
Akhil.

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:34.810
But having these extra feels they don't really matter.

00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:36.550
But at least let it be there.

00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:36.710
So,

00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:40.330
in case if we decide to have some validation in the future,

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:42.900
this will act to the placeholder for the same.

00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:44.180
So with this now,

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:48.020
our other contact get requests is taken,

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:50.580
care off in the next lecture.

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:53.860
Let's handle the post requests off this form
