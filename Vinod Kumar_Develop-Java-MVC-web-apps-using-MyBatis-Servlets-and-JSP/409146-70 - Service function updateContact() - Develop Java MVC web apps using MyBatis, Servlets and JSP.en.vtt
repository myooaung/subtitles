00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.170
in this sector.

00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:05.900
Let's read a serous function that receives the contact details on.

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.010
Then there's some basic valuations,

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.590
just like the one that we did in the eye contact.

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.280
And then in the deal function toe updated the changes in the database.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.180
So let's begin by writing a function here.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.760
So somewhere after this ad contact and generate a function called Public Wide update

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:25.550
contact,

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.840
the first perimeter is gonna bay in digital I.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:29.220
D.

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.620
And this is the idea of the contact that you're tryingto edit on.

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.270
The second pyramid is going to be the contact object.

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.440
Let's call it a C.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.230
And the 3rd 1 is going to be an editor's object,

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.710
which we are goingto filling based on validation error.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.240
So I'm gonna create a Mac.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:50.850
You're off type string string as key and value data types on the variable name.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.070
I'm gonna call it us enters Dysfunction is a wide,

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.030
so there's nothing to be written from here.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.990
So the step number one is toe pass on this idee toe.

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:06.860
The contact object because the contact object may not have any idea because in the HTML

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.390
form that we're using here,

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.610
there is no field for the contact.

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.450
I d on the contact idea comes from the perimeter here.

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:22.300
So obviously we have got one set of details representing the contact object on one request

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.880
perimeter,

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.940
representing the I D off the contact.

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.620
So that is the reason we have to do it over here now,

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:33.120
since I D is an object of reference type here so you can always check for null miss and

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.450
then add a validation also,

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:36.500
however,

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:42.640
because we are in working with the update contact from the sunlit there were tryingto

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.410
convert the string Islay into an integral ready.

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:46.120
And obviously,

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.090
if that is now,

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:48.840
you'll get a number formal exception.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.320
So that is the reason we don't have to worry about that.

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.040
So we will now say,

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.530
cedar set I d off Heidi.

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:56.590
That is done.

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.140
Now we need to do the validation for this contact.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.460
See,

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.490
which is nothing but the validations that we have done already over here.

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.470
So I'm going to copy the cold from here till here.

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:14.410
So copy this and then paste over here and I don't need to return.

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.040
See from here because it's a wide function.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.210
So I'll say your return.

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:22.730
I noticed we will not be able to check for duplicate email or duplicate phone number

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.220
because this email and phone number already exists in the data vegetable for the same

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.580
record.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.990
So we will skip that in case if every other validation is okay.

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:38.270
So I'll have to do is to call the deal function called update contact on to do that.

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:45.160
Let's simply copy this line where I'm pleading a contact there will object based over here

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.160
,

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.410
and then they would not update contact off.

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.980
See,

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:57.590
we'll also throw away the IRA exception coming from this line on our service function is

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.020
now ready In the next lecture,

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:02.980
let's make use off dysfunction in the controller.
