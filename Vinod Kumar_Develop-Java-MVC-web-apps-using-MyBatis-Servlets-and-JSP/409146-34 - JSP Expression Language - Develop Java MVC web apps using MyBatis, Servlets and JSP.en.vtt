00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.010
Jsp 2.0.

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.730
Introduce something or expression language,

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:07.880
which can be used along with Js Steel.

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.450
In this lecture,

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.250
let's discuss about expression language to understand the same thing.

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:13.670
That's great.

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:20.230
A J s Peace or right click on the Bat folder New JSP FIGHT Let's call it us.

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:21.830
He'll dash demo,

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:22.750
press enter.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.530
Let's give the same s title over here Demo.

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:29.540
Which one he'll demo as well.

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:34.100
Let's give a lecture when we were working with Yield and JST L.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.770
We generally don't want to use the script plates and declaration blocks and other JC

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:41.660
wondered X features.

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.360
But for the sake of demonstration,

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.600
I'm gonna use a skull plate over here.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.420
When we start using NBC application,

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.480
you will see that JSP is completely free off Jolla.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:53.630
But for the time being,

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:55.360
let's put a script lit over here.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.690
Onda declare a variable called name equals toe.

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.230
Let's say I give my name notice.

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:07.770
This becomes the local variable off the resulting separate classes service function.

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.000
But if I want to use that using an eel,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.030
we can't do that because it's a local variable.

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.450
What we have to do is we have to store this name in scope.

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.130
Unlike some village where there are three scopes,

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.730
requests,

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:22.950
session and application,

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.440
JSP has an additional scope,

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.560
which is called page scoop on the reason they introduced.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.950
This is because in Jsp you can also include other J space.

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.960
But we don't want to mix up the variable stored in one jsp and variable stored in the other

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:38.420
Jsp.

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.850
So they introduced something called Page Scope.

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:41.700
On the page.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.440
Cope is represented using an implicit object called Page Context,

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.420
which has got exact same function,

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:54.430
like set out to get a tribute Onda remove attribute so we can say your page context Dart

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:59.850
set at a beauty contest controlled space over here and you can see we got the name.

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.010
Let's give it a name here as name itself on the value is the variable name,

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:06.090
so it can be different.

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.590
But general practices the same thing.

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.510
Now you can see I can come here and then type say,

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.630
Hey,

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.340
three hello dollar in curly bracket,

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:16.490
we can say name.

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.940
So this is the expression language we're talking about.

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:25.180
Where the value stored in a attribute can be accessed in this format.

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.150
Let's give it a try by running the same thing.

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.480
I'm gonna right click around as run on server,

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.020
and you can see it is hello,

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.160
we not come are safe.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.630
I go and do a view.

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:36.440
Pesos.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.060
You'll see that there is no special syntax over here.

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.820
It's just the value off that.

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:42.350
So,

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:43.090
in other words,

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:48.050
this particular dollar curly bracket is an expression language,

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:49.390
and it can do many things.

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.740
Right now,

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:53.250
we're just tryingto print the value off something that is stored in a scope.

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.130
Now the editor that you see here is basically an eclipse.

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:58.450
Probably you can say,

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.740
but if I cut this and placed it back over here,

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.090
you can see that the other is gone.

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.910
So when you give your dollar name by default,

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.780
it looks in the lawyers to scope that it's possible,

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:10.950
which is a page scope.

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.060
But if it's not funny,

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.750
the page called,

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.550
then it's going to go and look in the request scope.

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:16.710
And if it's found,

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:18.230
it's going to use that if it's not fun,

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.080
it's going to go to the session scope.

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.040
And if it's not foreign inefficient scope,

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.220
then it's going to go into the application school.

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:29.920
So the other three scopes are nothing but a request session on application with the

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:30.900
respective names.

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.030
For example,

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.970
if I store request are set attribute off name,

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:38.710
let's say I give a different name.

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:39.410
Hearsay.

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:40.390
Shan sunder.

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:42.850
Close the bracket and save it.

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:43.780
Now you see,

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.510
in spite off the request,

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.800
having an active it called name,

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.810
it's completely ignored by this.

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.930
So if ago and refreshed over here,

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.520
you'll still see it says hello.

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.770
We know,

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:55.250
come on.

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:00.530
But if I come in this line because it is not fun in the page scope,

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.320
but it is phone in the request,

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:03.440
Kobe is going to take this thing.

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:04.430
So I'm going to save this.

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.940
Go back and refresh the same you can take says hello shops in there.

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:13.420
But sometimes you may have data in different scopes with the same activity name,

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.580
and you may want to access the same thing.

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.420
You can always access that by giving a perfect for example,

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:23.050
let's say I'm gonna copy this and paste it one more time.

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:24.230
This one,

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.960
by default,

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.090
picks up in the lowest scope that its form,

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:28.680
which is speech scope in this case.

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:34.130
But let's I want to be very specific and say Get this from the request cope I can always a

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:42.300
request scope dot name on The reason why this works is that in the page context there is an

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.120
attribute called Request Scope that represents requests.

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.050
Object itself.

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:48.180
Likewise,

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:54.160
you can also say your session scope dot name on if I copy this and faced one more time and

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.730
then I can also say here application scope dot name.

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:59.590
However,

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.390
in sessions Copan application scope,

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:02.730
I don't have any names.

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:04.640
So if I go here and they're fresh,

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:09.150
you'll see that the third and fourth are not giving any output touch because there's no

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:09.590
value.

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:12.730
You can also have conditional or put inside this.

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:13.580
For example,

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.210
if Sessions scoped out Name is no.

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:17.320
I want to say,

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:17.670
hello,

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:18.310
friend,

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:19.390
But if it's there,

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:20.410
I want to print the same things.

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:24.730
I'm gonna copy this and I'll tell your is it equals tonal question.

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:25.090
Mark.

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:26.260
If the answer is yes,

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.330
let's given output are saying that's a friend.

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.430
But in case if the sessions called Dark Name is not Donald,

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:35.280
then I want to give the session scope dark name itself.

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:36.150
Same thing.

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:37.410
I can also do for this.

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:38.840
That I'm gonna copy this.

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:39.850
Put a question mark.

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:41.020
I'm gonna give you,

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:41.350
say,

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:43.140
friend Colon,

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:45.040
and then I'm gonna give application scope.

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:46.800
So in both cases,

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:47.590
it's going to say Hello,

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:48.080
friend.

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:49.120
I'm going to save this.

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.330
Go back over here.

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:51.320
Refresh.

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:51.920
You can say it.

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:52.340
Says hello,

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:52.870
friend.

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:53.920
I forgot.

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.120
Are here a condition?

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.390
Is there equals to know?

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:57.880
It didn't give me an adult job,

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:00.230
but I'm gonna go back and the fresh over here,

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:01.480
you can see it's the same thing.

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:02.300
However,

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:09.390
if I store a value over here like session dot set attribute Andi lettin name.

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:10.210
Come on,

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:15.170
let's say I want to give it us John Doe on and also another one.

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:17.450
This time it's called Application.

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:20.390
So the implicit objects are page context,

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:22.140
request station and application.

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:24.320
But the value uses either.

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:25.120
If you don't mention,

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:27.340
it's going to go and look it in multiple scopes.

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:29.830
But by default it's going to look in the paid scope.

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:32.760
The request go obsessions called application scope.

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.220
So let's change this to let's say,

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:35.130
for example,

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:36.650
Robert Miller,

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:37.660
save this.

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:38.850
Go back over here.

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:40.420
It should not give me hello.

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:45.170
Message for different names over here other than request cope session scope,

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:48.450
application scope the another expression that we can use.

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:48.740
Call.

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:52.270
That's Param Param corresponds to the request perimeter,

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:53.280
for example.

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:55.950
Let's say I have your A text box.

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:58.470
Input type equals toe text.

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:02.750
Let's give a placeholder equals toe ender A name?

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:04.030
Andi.

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:07.000
I also want toe put this inside of farm.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.800
So if you submit the farm,

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:13.850
it's gonna come back to the same jsp so that their action equals to an empty string.

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:19.900
Onda slash form over here So I can type something and then press enter and then I can come

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:20.940
down over here.

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:22.890
I'll type your head story.

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:24.730
Hello?

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:25.500
Come on.

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:28.170
I cannot take your dollar.

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:33.600
Barham dot name were Name is supposed to be a request perimeter That supposed to be the

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:34.850
name of this text box.

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:36.110
So let's give your name.

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:37.440
It cools toe name.

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:38.210
Now,

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:41.950
if this is a confusion that's changes toe your underscored name.

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:46.550
So basically we're supposed to look for your underscored name in the harem.

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:52.180
If it is equals toe no to initially you're not passing any value.

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:52.690
Obviously,

00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:55.400
it's gonna be no science a your friend,

00:07:55.400 --> 00:08:02.140
but otherwise I'm gonna say your bottom dot You're underscored me like this.

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:09.240
So Adam is a standard expression representing the request dot Get perimeter.

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:10.070
So once again,

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:13.000
you see that I read what you see here is not really an era.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.250
So I'm gonna cut this and then paste it back over here on eclipse has some kind of bug over

00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:18.500
there,

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:19.900
so we'll ignore that.

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:21.330
So I'm gonna go back on,

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:22.340
then the fresh.

00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:26.490
You can see that since there is no request perimeter past it says,

00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:26.880
hello,

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:27.390
friend.

00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:29.260
But if I'm gonna type your say,

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:30.470
for example,

00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:31.200
Ravi,

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:33.330
press enter on,

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:34.820
even see that it is Hallo,

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:35.410
Robbie.

00:08:35.410 --> 00:08:40.770
Because Rob is no past as a quiet string perimeter or request perimeter.

00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:42.650
Let's go back to a jsp.

00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:46.090
Let's take a bit more complex example for this.

00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:46.720
I'm in tow.

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:49.120
Create a new entity class here.

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:49.880
I don't have an entity,

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:50.430
Pakis.

00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:57.770
I'm gonna create an into the class on the interdict Last is called Let's say addressed and

00:08:57.770 --> 00:09:00.250
the address is gonna have a couple of variables.

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:01.870
I'm not gonna have too many of them.

00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:02.380
In this case.

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:05.680
I'm gonna simply savior city on state.

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:10.120
Nothing else I want to use lumber for the Gators and center.

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:16.460
So first we will go and get the Lombok dependency from MBI and depositor dot com.

00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:18.550
I'm gonna search for long book.

00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:21.950
Select the 1st 1 the latest abortion.

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:28.550
Copy the bomb dot xml Come back over here to my palm Dilek salmon based as a another

00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:29.640
additional dependencies.

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:30.450
Save this.

00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:32.550
Let's come back to our does their job.

00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:34.800
I want to have your couple of things.

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:37.070
Number one is a moderate.

00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:41.830
Know our constructor and I want a all dogs constructor.

00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:42.390
Also,

00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:44.040
I want better.

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:50.410
I want sector So we have all the required members over here for JSP.

00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:52.410
Getters are very important.

00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:54.470
Sectors may not be that important,

00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:57.150
and I forgot to change the name of the packets.

00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:59.530
So it came as Web for a good practice.

00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:01.880
That's also changes toe entity.

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:06.130
Save this and see you get another because it says the packages called out.

00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:07.030
We know that in today,

00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:12.720
but it is in fact the package Breast Command one or controlled one and then moved it to the

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:14.780
new package called Entity.

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:18.820
Now let's rightly conduct into the Packers and create a new class called us.

00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:22.770
Let a person Let's create a couple of variables over here.

00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:25.360
Private string name,

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:29.970
private address addressed on.

00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:31.370
As in the previous case,

00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:34.770
I want all these annotations to be added there also.

00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:36.790
I'm gonna copy this and based over here.

00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:45.720
And let's go back to our yelled the mortar jsp and construct a person object first.

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:47.350
Let Creadon at the subject.

00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:54.100
Make sure you press control space Enter on automatic import takes place are just entity

00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:55.890
equals toe new interests.

00:10:55.890 --> 00:10:57.850
On the new address,

00:10:57.850 --> 00:10:59.360
I can supply the city name,

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:07.260
which is Bangla and then Karnataka as the state and I want to create a person so person

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:13.290
controlled space enter and then I type your B one equals toe new person on.

00:11:13.290 --> 00:11:17.300
I just want to use the constructor with the mean that I'm gonna give my name.

00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:17.710
We know.

00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:18.190
Come on.

00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:21.560
And then I tape your adedy which is the second perimeter.

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:25.740
So we do have a constructor that takes perimeter because of the all our eggs.

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:26.490
Constructor,

00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:27.960
This will be the first Param Eter.

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:29.250
That will be the second perimeter.

00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:34.150
You can see that over here Birth in which takes string and address as arguments,

00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:36.750
we now have this variable p one,

00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:37.930
but that's a local variable.

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:42.940
But if you want heel toe access that you have to store it in some of the scope.

00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:49.580
And this time we will store this in request cope with a request are set attribute on.

00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:53.190
I want to give it us a person and then p one.

00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:57.010
So person is what actually your expression language would use,

00:11:57.010 --> 00:11:59.050
but it actually refers to p one.

00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:01.360
Soto make use off the same.

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:04.800
I'm gonna go and print something in the beginning itself.

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:08.650
Let's give a dave slash deal on inside the deal.

00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:11.460
I want toe type name Colon on.

00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:14.010
I want to print the name off the person.

00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:18.330
I can simply type your dollar person dot name.

00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:19.150
That's it.

00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:26.160
So you can see that person is a value found in one of the scope it is going to check in the

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:26.630
page.

00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:27.700
Hope it is not fun,

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:30.140
but it is found in the request scope.

00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:35.730
And then it's going to go and make use of the get name function within the object people.

00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:38.640
So people has get name which is going to give you we know Come on.

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:42.040
And the next one we want to print a city and state.

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:49.580
Let's give a br over here on city is nothing but dollar person Person represents p one

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:52.720
people has a function called get address.

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:57.960
But inside the expression language is simply have to say just that corresponds to the gator

00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:58.630
dysfunction.

00:12:58.630 --> 00:12:58.940
Now,

00:12:58.940 --> 00:12:59.470
if you remember,

00:12:59.470 --> 00:13:05.440
the gator dysfunction returns an object off address and that had a function called Get City

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:05.440
,

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:11.280
we can simply make use of the city here toe call the get city function and likewise,

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:14.010
I can simply copy and paste This are probably,

00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:15.590
I can say state on.

00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:23.630
Then I said dollar person dot Just start state Let's give a br again Save this Go back over

00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:30.830
here toe our application Onda then the first is on You should know See name equals two city

00:13:30.830 --> 00:13:36.160
calls to Stickles toe dead it to their appropriate values coming from the object In

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:36.900
practice,

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:41.770
the object p one would have been either created or returned from the database in a subtle

00:13:41.770 --> 00:13:48.160
it on Ben stored in a request cope and then being dispatched over to this jsp and the jsp

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:53.850
simply going toe access this on print the values So we have clear coat separation off

00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:56.350
concerns John Locke or goes toe.

00:13:56.350 --> 00:13:57.040
Sorry it.

00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:58.730
So whatever that we have done over here,

00:13:58.730 --> 00:14:00.150
typical is down in the third.

00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:06.680
JSP will only access the data and print that on if you see it is much cleaner.

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:11.700
Instead of calling Jallow functions in ser Jay speak in the next lecture,

00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:16.950
let's have a look at what is called Js steel or JSP standard tag libraries.
