00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.810
hello and welcome toe.

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:08.990
Develop Java,

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.560
NBC,

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.180
perhaps using my Baptist sublets and Jsp.

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.440
My name is we not on.

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.550
I'm going to be your instructor for the training.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.590
If you're a Java developer,

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.050
then you must know about sunlit and JSP.

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.450
You might hear people saying that salads and J.

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:28.110
C are no longer in use,

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:30.840
but that is not true for newer products.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:31.590
Probably people,

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.740
maybe preferring spring all spring.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:34.460
Buddha Spring,

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.270
NBC Hello World.

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.920
There are so many projects that were developed using salads and jsp in the past that it's

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:42.460
really,

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:43.620
really difficult toe.

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.690
Replace them with new frameworks.

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.340
Having said that fundamental idea behind any Web applications is going to be separate and

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.900
GSP.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:52.950
For example,

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:58.330
if you're working with a spring embassy or on Apache stretch from work behind the scene,

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.540
they all depend on the someone a p A.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:06.610
And having a clear understanding off how Starlets JST and dynamic Web applications in

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:07.380
general work,

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.160
understanding Modern Famous becomes much simpler and easier.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.710
So,

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:12.690
as the title says,

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.930
the course basically talks about three different technologies.

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.380
My batters sublet on Jsp,

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.430
so in order to take up this course,

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.470
you must have a basic understanding off Court Java concepts.

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:25.830
But other than that,

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.610
there is no specific predict with it here.

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.150
If you know very basic html r CSS,

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:33.120
that should be good enough.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.030
While we don't called anything in CSS by ourselves,

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.850
So we will be using a framework called bootstrap toe style our application.

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:41.740
In fact,

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.400
when we are learning selection jsp,

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.970
we don't even want to talk about the CSS are any other remarks?

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.550
We only focused on the internal core aspects off sublet NJC,

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:54.500
including the project that we're going to create.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.940
The course is divided in tow around 13 different sections.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.700
And this is the first section where I'm introducing you to the courts and what you're going

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.480
to learn what you're going to create.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:08.240
Apart from that will also be discussing about the software set up on your computer.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.950
But that section number two is all about a party in my bed is,

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.450
and for those who don't know what happened to my body,

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.330
is basically it's an SQL mapper.

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:23.810
It associates in a skill command with function in an interface and then dynamically creates

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:29.930
a class writing all the court necessary toe exec SQL Command and then get the values.

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.040
Convert that into an entity or domain object that you want.

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.970
It's a really fantastic tool without having to write a single line of Jerry Busy cold.

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.130
You will be doing everything that Jerry B.

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:41.030
C is supposed to do.

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.150
While it's quite simple,

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.890
it's very,

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:44.530
very powerful.

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.940
Actual.

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.860
The fiction about three is about sunlit and jsp,

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.780
so both of them are covered in the same section.

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.060
We will be discussing about the war.

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.770
View off how job applications work.

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.160
What is a war file on?

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.550
What is its structure?

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.290
Setting up off Apache dunker in eclipse,

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:08.120
creating a May 1 project on understanding the salary PS like the seller interferes Gentex

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.750
Alert Class and http Seller class.

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:17.670
Then we moved to creating or forced 100 plus handling the quite a string perimeters doing

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:18.960
something like client surgery.

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:24.810
Directions are outside include and forwards understand very important scopes called request

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.540
session and applications cope with practical examples.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.810
And then we move on to what's called Java Server pages R.

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:31.680
J s case.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.180
We will explore all possible JSP elements,

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.020
specifically the JSP scripting elements.

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.420
Now,

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.870
if you're learning modern JC,

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.120
you don't have to really learn about the scripting element.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.890
However,

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.940
it is quite possible that you may be working on a maintenance project which requires older

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:50.150
versions of JSP.

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:56.110
And having a good knowledge on the scripting elements gives you an idea as why it should be

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:00.570
awaited in the first place and should be replaced with Jay Steel and expression language,

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:04.710
which we learn by clearing a small embassy application.

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:05.820
Apart from that,

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:09.120
we will also be covering cookies as a less filters.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.680
Once this section is over,

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:16.900
then we get our hands dirty and create a phone book MBC application while the product

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.490
patient itself is divided in tow 8 to 9 different sections instead of walking through

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:22.580
different sections,

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:27.150
I want to show you the demonstration off the product that we are going to create.

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.010
Here is the homepage off our applications.

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:36.000
So you visit local stage rated o slash phone book on your application comes up noticing the

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.910
intern application.

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:39.940
We don't access the J space directly here at all,

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.960
and that's to follow the best practices.

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.360
And throughout the course,

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.810
we're gonna follow the best practices in the industry so that our application is high,

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:53.560
performing on very stable So as you consider a few links over here,

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.840
a user can register himself or herself on.

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.750
If I take on traditional without typing anything,

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.970
you can see that we get some Adam messages right away there itself.

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:06.660
But let's say if I register a user called Children,

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:11.620
let's take Iran at example dot com There's going to be the user name as well in the past,

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:16.290
but I'm gonna give it us secret on the enter that as secret as well.

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:18.300
If I click on this register,

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:23.530
the password will be stored in and one way encrypted fashion so nobody will be able to

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:26.340
access your password even from the database.

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:29.640
So if I go to the database control over here on defy,

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:30.220
say selects,

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:30.850
start from use.

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:31.630
As you can see,

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:36.780
parents password is being hashed and stored along with the other passport also.

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:41.620
So one time in the dashboard you might have observed that the register and log in links

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:42.310
have gone,

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:44.250
but instead I have a couple of others.

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:45.770
I contact view,

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:47.190
all contacts in law goat.

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:48.600
So if I log out,

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:51.090
you can see that the register and log in comes back.

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:54.530
Let's log in using killin at example dot com.

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:55.870
That's the email,

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:58.020
which is used a their user really agile.

00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:59.630
And then the possibly secret.

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:05.360
Let's press enter and you can see I'm taken toe the dashboard And while in the dashboard I

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.570
will be ableto add a new contact,

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:08.700
our view,

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:10.190
all existing context.

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:11.950
And since Karen is the new user,

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:13.530
there is no contacts over here.

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:16.360
Let's go a lot off and log in with their different user.

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:17.350
I'm gonna go and type.

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:24.260
You're We know I'd be no dot co I'm gonna click on logging on You can see that it takes me

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:25.590
to the dashboard merited Hello.

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:26.260
We not command.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.650
This is coming from the session data.

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:35.250
Now I can take on view all contacts and I should be able to see all the contents notice

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:37.100
there is a default profile picture.

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:39.960
In case if you have not specified the image you are,

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:43.050
then automatically it's going to take a D for delta.

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:45.610
While you are able to see different users,

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:48.810
you should also be ableto click on a particular user toe.

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:50.850
View the details Onda.

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:52.220
Once you are viewing,

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:52.900
you should be able,

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:53.220
tow,

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:53.770
edit,

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:56.340
or delete So If I click delete this button,

00:06:56.340 --> 00:07:00.830
you can see that it's going to say this is gonna permanently delete the record from our

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:02.350
database cannot be undone.

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:03.940
So in order to confirm,

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:08.460
I have to type this phrase permanently delete over here and then take on the D League,

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:10.180
then it gets deleted permanently.

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:17.610
Let's go back and click on the Edit D days while you can see that the entire form is filled

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:19.070
with the details of the person.

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:21.870
If I make any changes over here,

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:22.770
for example,

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:24.180
the PIN code is going to be,

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:24.670
let's say,

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:29.220
88987 We can't save details.

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:33.750
You can see that the PIN code has been updated along with the rest of the details.

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:37.620
We should be able to also add a new contact Andi,

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:38.760
without typing anything.

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:43.060
If I click on the same details for then you would see that there is some basic elevation

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:44.180
also has been taken.

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:44.650
Care off.

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:46.450
Apart from the elections,

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:47.890
you can also see in the footer.

00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:51.960
There is a change team option where the user can choose different teams.

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:57.440
Onda choosing a different team will change the look and feel off the application but it's

00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:58.420
not only for this,

00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:00.070
but if I go to view all contacts now,

00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:03.550
you can see every page has the exact same look and feel.

00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:05.330
And of course I can change this.

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:06.660
When I take on any others,

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:08.390
it's going to take me to the home page a game.

00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:09.930
But if I come back,

00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:14.010
you will see that the team has affected all of the pages off our application.

00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:16.750
Apart from creating the application,

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:19.420
we are also going to create a production build on,

00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:24.700
then understand what is the process in oil in deploying your application onto a Tomcat

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:25.160
server?

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:28.370
So the courses almost 10 hours long,

00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:30.810
duration with lots of according to be done,

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:33.820
I'm super excited to present this court's to you.

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:39.520
I hope you like this course and enjoy learning as much as I enjoyed creating this course.

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:41.650
So see you inside the course
