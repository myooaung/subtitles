00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.980
now that we are able toe get details off one single contact in the next few lectures,

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:12.220
let's try to get the list off all the contacts that we have as a lot of the newser on since

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:15.270
we decided to go with the bottom up approach.

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:16.330
In this lecture,

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:21.850
I'm gonna create the deal function required for getting the list off all contacts.

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:23.650
It's gonna be very,

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:24.500
very simple.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.690
Let's go to the contact to deal and add a quite a function here,

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:36.260
which Retton's list off contact on the name of the function is Get all contacts.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.050
There is no parameters here.

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.400
That's important list from you till by pressing command shift or control,

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.200
shift on windows and then map this toe a simple,

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.030
select statement that says Select,

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:54.260
start from contacts without any conditions so I can simply copied this part and then based

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.870
over here and then removed aware condition.

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.300
That gives me the list off all the contacts.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.820
Now with this now we are able to talk to the database,

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.330
get all the contacts in the form of their job or a duty lot list.

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:09.720
In the next lecture,

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.330
let's write a service function,

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:17.580
but actually the facade are superficial layer toe in or dysfunction on behalf off the

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:18.170
controller
