00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.120
in this picture.

00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:08.210
Let's create a JSP that can loop over the collection of context that we have on display.

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:13.020
A contact in the form off called a card typically looks like this.

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:14.240
There is an image.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.930
There is a title and there is some texture in there is some kind of a button if you want on

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:23.220
this card template is provided by bootstrap,

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.620
so you can simply computer get Bush under con trick on the documentation such for cards

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:29.010
here.

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.180
And then you get this.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.800
So here is the HTML snippet corresponding to the same thing.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.910
So we're gonna copy and paste this and make some necessary changes.

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.600
So let's go force to our eclipse.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.810
Copy this name,

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:44.650
show context or JSP,

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:45.370
right?

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:46.840
Like the views folder,

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:54.130
new JSP file and then paste the name press enter and we got our template here.

00:00:54.130 --> 00:01:00.850
So here is where I want to Just type a list off all your contacts on In case if you don't

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.470
have any contacts you just created and you're tryingto click the hyperlink,

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.870
you should probably get a message saying that.

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:07.060
Hey,

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.360
sorry.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.730
You don't have any context.

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.420
Please click the add contacto at a new one,

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.740
but otherwise we have toe loop over a collection,

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.240
and the collection is on object called contacts.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.790
This is the list off contact objects.

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.260
I have access to that in my GST.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.940
In order to loop over the collection.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.680
I need toe first include the J Steel Tig Library.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:36.910
So I'm gonna come down here and then say less than a percentage at tag Lib Ur equals toe J

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:37.330
speech.

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.230
A steel core prefix equals toe.

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.890
See?

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:48.720
And now I come here and then say sequel and forage and forage requires mandatory collection

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:48.720
.

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:55.550
We need to use the attribute called items equals toe dollar and then say here contacts,

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.250
That is the activity name that I've stored here.

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:59.930
But if you want to be more specific,

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.150
you can always say request scope,

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.880
dot contacts and from the contacts collection.

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.670
I want toe process one at a time.

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:14.100
So that one variable I can say what equals to see which is the contact object from the

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.660
collection.

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.750
Now that I have one contact,

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:22.210
I just need to display that in this format and because this is going to occupy a smaller

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.870
space,

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:23.880
I can say that Hey,

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:29.580
in one dro I need either Three of them are four off them and I can make use of the row and

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.680
column combination toe do the same thing.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.690
So the first thing that I'm gonna do is tow surround this sequel and forage with dear class

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:44.920
equals to roll aan den slash Do after this and inside this I know I have to say one column

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.920
,

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.820
but the column is going occupy.

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.980
Maybe three grades are four grades.

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.270
If you say four words,

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.260
that means there's gonna be three columns,

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.460
so that should be okay for me.

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:56.550
So I'm gonna just copy this text.

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.160
I have a copy.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.150
I can over here,

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.950
click on that,

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.580
come back and then based We got a deal.

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.440
Classical stow card here,

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:13.070
Alonso type call dash MD Dash four on Because this is gonna occupy a fixed to wit within a

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.400
given,

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.730
bro,

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.130
I don't need this style equals two and so on.

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:23.300
So it i nd SRC equals two is nothing but the c dot after So that's gonna be here.

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:30.820
Let's type dollar cedar outer the classes find ultimate text is going to be the name off

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:31.830
the contact.

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:34.970
I will say dollar Cedar Force name,

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:38.160
probably with a space dollars seed out.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.940
Last name.

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:44.430
So the first name last name combination is going to be the ultimate text on inside the car

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.430
.

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:45.280
The body.

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.980
We have a card title on the car title.

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.570
I'm going toe copied this section and pace because that's the name of the person I'm

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:53.910
interested in over here.

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.200
And then I have a paragraph which displaced,

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:56.950
um text.

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:02.030
I'm just going to display the city on state off the contact.

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.040
So I'm gonna type your dollar,

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.150
see Dark city,

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.770
give a space and then say dollar si dot state.

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:13.020
Let's former it and see how this is gonna look like when I access this.

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:16.960
So I'm gonna write like my project around as run on,

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:17.380
sir one.

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:23.030
And in that disqualify type directly view all contacts.

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:27.570
This will take me directly to the log informed because it is protected.

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.600
Why are the log in check sublet?

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.060
So first let's log in.

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:36.120
We know that we know Darko Secret breast center on now.

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.480
I have a link here to save you all contacts.

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.660
I don't have to manually type here but electric on this link,

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:46.200
it supposed to show me the details off Three people on I.

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:51.880
I also probably made this trader default contact picture over here on to do that.

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.340
We need to use a condition here.

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:55.390
So if see,

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:59.670
dark after is equals toe empty string question mark,

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:02.230
Then I would give a default value.

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.810
Otherwise,

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:09.910
how to get seed out Altar on this is gonna be don't slashed a sets slash major slash

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:10.750
default.

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:15.030
Dashed profile dot jp e g Saved this.

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:18.100
Go back to the browser on now.

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.850
You can see I got the details off these people.

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:24.200
I also have here something called Go Somewhere instead of this.

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:29.850
I want to probably have a link to view the details off this person so I can go back over

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:30.400
here.

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.850
Let's say a hatred equals toe.

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:34.760
Let's give the dot,

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:36.760
slash view contact,

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:37.640
details.

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:40.690
Caution Mark ID equals toe dollar.

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:41.250
See that?

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:41.960
I d know.

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:42.870
Notice the cedar,

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:43.070
right?

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:44.220
It comes dynamically.

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:49.900
So the i d off the person that I'm actually looping over on this We addressed in the

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:55.610
previous use case where we're able to see the complete details of the person on inside off

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:57.100
button primary.

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:01.360
I can say VT and dash link that looks like a hyperlink.

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:04.050
And then I can say view details.

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:06.040
Save this.

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:07.560
Go back to the browser,

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.740
Refresh ones on.

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:11.390
Now we see it looks neater.

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:14.890
I click on view details off one person,

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:17.440
and you can see it comes back with this page.

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:19.450
So I click view all contacts.

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:21.750
I can say view details.

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:24.850
And if you don't want three off them anyone?

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:26.260
For Padro,

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:31.730
all you to do is to come back and change this column toe call MD tree.

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:34.770
So each card is gonna occupy three grids.

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:38.430
That means out of 12 now you'll have four different cards.

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:39.620
So if I save this,

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:41.420
go back and then refresh,

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:45.690
you will see that they become smaller because there's a room for one more here now.

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:50.750
And since it is possible that some people don't have those city and state,

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:53.910
the alignment off this is going up and don't.

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:57.190
So what we can do is we can remove this part from here.

00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:02.910
So instead of giving seed or city and see that state probably against a c dot email on a

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:04.330
space on DSI,

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:10.350
that phone that saved these go back and then the fresh and you can see now we have details

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:10.950
like this.

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:13.960
There is one more small issue that we have to address.

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:14.810
Remember,

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:20.410
this is supposed to show the list off all the context that a user has loved him Right now.

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:21.220
I have loved dinners.

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:23.400
We know that we know dot Go on.

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:26.950
If I goto my it's to console and look at the users.

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:29.630
There is only one user as well.

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:36.650
So let's go and log out here for no and then create a new user and I'll give you the name

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:37.390
as that say,

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:38.350
for example,

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:42.800
Kumar Kumar at example dot com password.

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:46.920
Let's also give it a secret Onda Reenter password Also secret.

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:48.300
Let's click on register.

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:52.250
So I have now loveliness Kumar not as we know.

00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:53.650
And if I goto,

00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:55.300
it's to console and say Run.

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:56.980
You can see that there are two users,

00:07:56.980 --> 00:08:00.590
but if I go on take on this view all contacts,

00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:03.640
you can see that the contacts added by the note.

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:05.030
It also listed over here,

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:10.780
which is totally wrong because we wanted to have a user specific contact list here.

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:16.130
I will be able to see the complete details off anybody that other you this would have added

00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:16.590
as well.

00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:18.600
Soto Address this issue.

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:20.850
Let's first go to our eclipse.

00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:23.030
Go to the contact deal.

00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:23.910
Dodge Allah,

00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:29.350
the quiet here says Select star from contact selects or from contact with the merely could

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:32.030
stow so and so and likewise for the phone.

00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:36.650
Each one of them also should filter based on a user's idea.

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:40.590
And the use already is nothing but the idea of the person who is logged in on these

00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:45.680
functions are involved from contact sarees and the contacts heiress function should receive

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:47.580
those user ratings from the controller.

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:48.880
I mean the controller.

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:51.680
We can get through the use ready from the session.

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:52.210
First,

00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:54.940
let's go to the controller that is invoking this,

00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:58.350
and that happens to be view all contacts separate,

00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:00.690
and this is where I'm in working That,

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:02.580
and just before in working this function,

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:05.780
we should get the user details from decision and then passed.

00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:07.280
They use ready to this function,

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:09.040
so let's do the same thing.

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:17.520
Let's say here user user equals toe user that the casting and then request dot get session

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:24.760
dot get attribute called User Andi user needs to be imported from our entity packets.

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:28.580
So command shift full or control shift on windows and then press enter.

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:32.120
And now we can say user dot get Aidi.

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:37.230
That is the idea of the person who is logged in and notice now eclipses complaining that

00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:39.130
dysfunction doesn't take such a perimeter.

00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:40.610
Either you are to create a new one.

00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:42.220
Are your toe enter that?

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:44.250
So if I move the cursor on that,

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:45.440
you can see it says removed.

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:48.670
Arguments to match this function or change the method.

00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:50.790
Get all contracts perimeter in Teacher.

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:51.880
That's what we want.

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:59.100
So if I click on that option in our conduct that risk a new argument this past on the name

00:09:59.100 --> 00:09:59.760
of the argument,

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:01.090
let's give it US user.

00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:01.350
I d.

00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:06.430
Here on that use already is what I may have to supply toe dysfunction.

00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:12.630
So let's do that on Eclipse once again tells me the same thing that the Guettel context

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:15.970
doesn't take any perimeters in the deal,

00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:21.040
so we have against they change them 1/3 get all contacts on perimeter in Teacher.

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:25.850
Let's click on that on that that comes over here so we got they use already.

00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:28.070
This can be no supply it or sell it.

00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:31.980
Statement here saying with user underscore,

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:34.850
80 equals toe hash user I.

00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:35.150
D.

00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:42.900
So this is how you filter users based on a use already that they're all over fights and

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:44.060
then restart,

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:48.180
dunk it and go back to the browser.

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:49.750
Let's Lago for a minute.

00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:52.060
I would like to log in us.

00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:56.150
Come on at example dot com and then pass with a secret.

00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:57.790
Let's click on Log in.

00:10:57.790 --> 00:10:59.430
I'm in the dashboard.

00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:05.010
Let me click on view All contacts on you can see that it simply comes back with a blank

00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:05.760
page here.

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:07.950
It would be good if we display and Adamis said,

00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:08.480
saying,

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:10.770
You don't have any contacts in your phone book.

00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:14.490
Let's go longer out here on logging us.

00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:18.640
We know that we know dot co on then secret clique logging.

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:23.850
Click on the view all contacts and you could see now I got all my contacts back.

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:27.890
Let's louder than other contact toe Kumar's phonebook.

00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:35.260
Let's enter the using AMs Kumar at example dot com Secret is the password I'm gonna go and

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:36.750
take on our contact.

00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:38.630
Let's add a name.

00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:51.930
Jane Doe Gender at example dot com phone number Some are better number and then probably

00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:52.690
outdoor.

00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:54.400
I'm gonna give http.

00:11:54.400 --> 00:12:00.570
Colon double slash cave in or dot com slash profile pictures on this time,

00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:05.150
I should say the men slash any number from 1 200 would do so.

00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:10.940
I'm gonna do here for dot jp g student or city state everything.

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:11.840
I'm gonna leave it blank.

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:12.490
But country,

00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:18.790
I'm gonna give us USA click on save details on This is where I will be able to see her

00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:20.310
details as really,

00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:21.620
for good of you all contacts.

00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:26.870
I should see one person over here if I log out and then log in as we know,

00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:34.290
I will not see Jane Doe's details over here because that doesn't belong to the user.

00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:34.660
We note,

00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:35.710
however,

00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:39.090
I can still go here and then say view,

00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:39.580
dash,

00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:40.770
contact details.

00:12:40.770 --> 00:12:45.930
Question Mark I d equals 24 on that is Jen does data,

00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:48.670
and you can see I'm still able to access,

00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:53.940
which is not correct on this can be fixed in the same way as we did for the list.

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:55.050
So remember,

00:12:55.050 --> 00:12:59.190
view contact details is actually the suburb that we have here.

00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:05.790
So view contact sublet on here when I'm actually getting the data using this service.

00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:06.980
Don't get contact by I.

00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:07.280
D.

00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:08.920
I have to supply the user.

00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:12.510
I d I'm gonna copy the court from the other subjects.

00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:15.940
So where I said user user recruit story could start get sessions.

00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:16.890
I'm gonna copy this,

00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:24.240
come back over here and then paste somewhere here and then supplied that user dot get i d.

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:26.520
This will give another in those surveys.

00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:29.990
So let's go toe change this method signature.

00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:33.630
We need to receive the use already on,

00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:36.460
then pass it to the get contact function over here.

00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:41.230
The get contact function in the Diablo also needs to be modified.

00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:44.240
So let's change the method signature over there as well.

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:49.210
So we got the variable and let's make use of the variable in the Selic statement.

00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:53.820
So the select statement should now be a select star from contacts where I d equals toe hash

00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:53.820
.

00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:59.730
Heidi as well as user underscore Eddie equals toe hash user.

00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:00.910
I d like this.

00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:02.320
That's restart.

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:11.180
Dunk it and then go back to the browser logging as we know that we know dot co paste the

00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:14.390
urine And then when I pressed enter here.

00:14:14.390 --> 00:14:14.940
You can see,

00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:16.840
we got an internal server error.

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:19.190
There was an error while processing your request.

00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:21.900
So if I go back to the console here on day,

00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:26.770
let me full screen the concern because it's his perimeter idee is not phone available

00:14:26.770 --> 00:14:30.030
perimeters r r one r zero bottom One problem,

00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:30.320
too.

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:31.710
That this is family,

00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:34.440
because when you have a single perimeter,

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:35.780
there is no problem.

00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:38.420
But when you have multiple parameters,

00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:43.700
you have to map each of this function argument toe these parameters that we abused over

00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:46.550
here by the for these perimeters have been given.

00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:48.970
Name is art zero or one for,

00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:49.120
um,

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:50.030
zero problem one.

00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:56.630
But if I want to change this to something like I d and use ready on whatever they do,

00:14:56.630 --> 00:14:57.950
you want to use the door here.

00:14:57.950 --> 00:15:00.250
You can see at the bottom.

00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:02.910
Bottom is from the my bed is packets.

00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:04.300
So I'm gonna select bottom,

00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:06.210
give the new name for this.

00:15:06.210 --> 00:15:11.070
So whatever the name you give you should be used over here on the same way I can give here

00:15:11.070 --> 00:15:12.830
at the bottom on.

00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:13.060
Then,

00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:13.530
user,

00:15:13.530 --> 00:15:14.070
I d.

00:15:14.070 --> 00:15:18.090
I'm keeping the same name as the variable names so that there is no confusion.

00:15:18.090 --> 00:15:20.460
So let's save this now.

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:26.960
Restart Tomcat and then go back to the browser.

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:29.680
I would have been already logged up.

00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:32.450
So if I click on Buel contacts or anything,

00:15:32.450 --> 00:15:33.370
I would be taken to log.

00:15:33.370 --> 00:15:34.460
Inform that center.

00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:37.310
We know that we know Darko Secret press.

00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:42.440
Enter Onda Now if I come down here and then face the Ural,

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:44.000
you can t taste.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:49.000
Sorry we didn't find any contact with 84 because I logged in as we know,

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:49.640
not ask.

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:50.000
Come on.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.680
So I can still say Give me the one with the three.

00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:57.470
That's not a problem on when I log out and log anus Kumar,

00:15:57.470 --> 00:16:06.840
you can see that I will be able to access the one with the 84 but not any other,

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:08.950
because the others do not belong.

00:16:08.950 --> 00:16:09.900
Toe Kumar.

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:16.620
So now we have an application that all those user specific contacts to be viewed either one

00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:18.250
at the time are as a list
