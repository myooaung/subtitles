00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.050
Let's had another link your called bar goat.

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:04.790
When we click on that,

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:09.270
we should simply be Longboat off the session and then should be redirected.

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:10.470
The log inform.

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:15.250
So let's go back to our eclipse on Go to the Head or J SPF.

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.500
We're gonna add a pipe over here and then at a hyperlink,

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.080
a hatred equals too dark slash law.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:22.650
Goat.

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.080
The capsule is going to be longer.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.510
We want one off these two to be disturbed.

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:31.340
Either this are they should be desperate.

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.520
We'll do that in the next lecture,

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.920
but for now let's provide the lager option to do that.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.750
Let's create a summit called Lagos Tablet,

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.040
which is only going to have a do get.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.240
So that's right Click or that package New class.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.520
Let's call it US Law Goat Summit Super Class.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:01:00.750
It's TDP thermal it click finish are the annotation at the rate website lit on day?

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.160
Your important off la goat that's had a default.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:05.350
It'll wash Genuity,

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:06.140
get it out.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.460
These comments and either do get over here,

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.620
and the only thing that it supposed to do is tow.

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:20.860
Remove the session object called user and then redirect the user to the log in form.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.260
All you have to do is to say,

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:28.140
request our get session and then say invalid it now invalid.

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.840
It means you remove all the objects that are currently kept in the session.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.880
So as you can see the committee's invalidates decision,

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.600
then unbind any objects bone to it.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.930
So that's the attributes that it's going to remote.

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.070
So I'm going to simply call this function and then we say here,

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.450
response start,

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:47.900
send redirect,

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.810
too dark slash logging Onda.

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:56.420
Obviously the user will be taken to the log inform and noted in the log in sunlit,

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.020
we are actually checking if the user has loved it,

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.600
obviously,

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.950
because we're now invalidating decision.

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.950
This is not going to work,

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.130
but instead it's going to give the logging dark J speak.

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:08.790
So let's say all the files,

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:12.260
right click or project rawness Our announcer.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.480
Where first,

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.520
let's try toe log in by taking on the log in button.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.480
It is in the email password.

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.890
Let's give the valued email.

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.720
We know that we know Darko valid possible,

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:27.750
which is secret.

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.310
Click on log in now I'm in the dashboard.

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.890
It said hello.

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.250
We not come on Welcome back.

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:34.910
If I click on log in,

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.160
you can see that it still says hello,

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.380
you know?

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.660
Come on,

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:38.220
welcome back.

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.210
It's not going to the log.

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:42.930
Inform how the world if I take on law goat,

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.920
you should not see that it's going to take you back to the log.

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.430
Inform also,

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.630
if you click on whole and click on logging because now I have been logged haute.

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.190
It'll take me back to the log in form instead of the dashboard.

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.900
Like earlier,

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.110
there's one small issue that we have not addressed.

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.960
For example,

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.990
if I am goingto log in using the proper email and password,

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:06.400
click on logging.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.190
You can see that clicking the log in button takes me back to the dashboard.

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.510
But clicking the register button will take me to the register form,

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.410
which is ideally incorrect because I'm already allowed been user.

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:23.520
So why would I be ableto registers included the user traced to with it this register linked

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.540
directly by typing in the address bar.

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:26.180
Then,

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.990
if the user has logged banality,

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:29.890
it should simply go to the dashboard.

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.740
The solution is the same as what we have done in the log in So let's go back to the log in

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:39.380
separate copy dissection and then go to the register,

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.910
separate and based in the do get.

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:42.670
So if you remember,

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.790
we had added here some to do so I'm gonna based forward day.

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.480
So if the user has already loved in,

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:50.910
we simply are going toe.

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:52.610
Redirect to the dashboard.

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:53.410
The tree.

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:54.350
Start dunk it,

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:58.180
then go back to the browser.

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:59.890
Let's Lago for once.

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.260
If I click on the large and it takes me to the log,

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:02.720
inform.

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:03.830
If I click on register,

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:05.160
it takes me to the register.

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:05.930
Kick on home.

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:06.680
It's working.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.790
Click on Logging on.

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.200
Then let's give the user name and password properly.

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.550
Click the logging,

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:15.860
so I'm now in the dashboard.

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:17.780
So if I go to the home,

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.670
come back to the log in to take me back to the dashboard.

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:23.470
If I go to the home and click on register,

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:30.300
it will still take me back to the dashboard so the register form will not appear because I

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.070
won't belong to the moment of law goat.

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:34.590
It takes me to the log in form,

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.270
and if I take the register now,

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:37.950
it'll take me to the register form.

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:40.100
So this is what we wanted.

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.830
Actually,

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.760
the only thing that is missing now is the conditional.

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.340
Displaying off these buttons,

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:50.340
I either need a combination of video log in our log out button,

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.210
not together in the next lecture.

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:54.570
Let's does the same thing.
