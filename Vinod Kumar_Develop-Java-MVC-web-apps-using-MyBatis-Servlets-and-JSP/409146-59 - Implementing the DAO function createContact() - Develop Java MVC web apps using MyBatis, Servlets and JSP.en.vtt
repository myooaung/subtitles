00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.280
in the previous couple off lectures we implemented.

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:09.020
The other contacts are Let's do post function where it's calling this function called our

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:11.180
new user from the contact stories.

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:17.550
But I realized that the function name is wrongly given because we're not adding a new user

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:17.550
.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:18.850
We're writing a new contact.

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:20.000
However,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.500
Eclipse gives us a feature where I can rename dysfunction on.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.010
It gets affected everywhere.

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.240
You can also check the usage of dysfunction in their intact project.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:35.790
You can just right click and then say here references and then say Project an eclipse will

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.500
show you where this function has been called and you can see in the new post it's been

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:40.950
called.

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.530
We can just click on this or double click this to select Go to re factor rename.

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:47.600
Let's call it US.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.970
Add new contact and then press Enter Andi.

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.510
If I go to the ad contact summer it,

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.230
you can see even there.

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:56.530
Also,

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.400
it's been reflected with that change.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:00:59.780
Done.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.810
Let's go to the contact deal on are the 11.

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:07.060
My back is annotations also lets group all the functions in tow.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.740
Tread on quality separately,

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:16.080
so it's type your cut on qualities and This is supposed to be the Kurd function because

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.870
it's the create contact.

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.730
And these are quite is because they either return a single entity order.

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:29.710
A list of entities on the 1st 1 here is going to be at the rate insert on insert should be

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:36.900
imported from my baddest package on the SQL Command is gonna be insert in tow contacts and

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.910
then the field names which we want to in third and the values which were supposed to supply

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:46.910
Onda Contact Stable has 12 different columns.

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:48.350
Let's open the debate script.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.110
So these are the columns.

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.450
This one is something that we don't want the supply because it's going to be auto generated

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.450
.

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.420
And the rest of them we're gonna supply and noticed that use already and created that have

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:00.350
an underscore.

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:01.590
But in our object,

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:02.870
we have camel caps.

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:03.940
Let's go to the contact,

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:04.230
Dave.

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.530
Oh,

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:11.650
and give all the columns that we're gonna insert your So it's gonna be flushed me last name

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.860
email for Outer.

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:20.220
Then we have the address City state in court.

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.120
Country user underscore.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.460
Eddie created,

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.530
underscored at You can press,

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.730
enter here toe break up the string and continue in the next lane,

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.800
so it becomes easy for us to view completely.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.680
And then here I have to type hash on inside the bracket.

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:44.420
I'm supposed to give the fields that come from this contact object corresponding toe.

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:45.880
These column names,

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.230
they're all same,

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:48.060
like first name,

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.460
last name.

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.250
Everything is same upto here.

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.350
Only the user underscore Eddie created and this correct change.

00:02:53.350 --> 00:03:00.450
So let's start typing Force name and then a hash calibrated last name.

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.230
And I'm gonna pause the video and complete this string.

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:10.590
So I finished adding all the column names and the next two functions are more or less

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:11.160
similar.

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:18.040
So we have toe energy losing at the rate select import from my by this package and the

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.590
quality is gonna be select.

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:26.500
Start from contacts were email equals toe hash email like this.

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.970
We know that email is a unique column.

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:30.860
In our Davis Cup,

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.920
you have ensured that email and phone numbers are unique,

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.880
which means if it under the record,

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.200
there's gonna be a maximum off one record,

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.650
and hence my buddies knows how to convert that into a single contact object.

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:43.620
However,

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:49.090
when it retraces the column names user underscore Ready and created underscore that they

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.080
don't have any relevant field names in here.

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.990
And that is where we have to use what is called at the rate results.

00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:01.880
So we're going to say there it results because there are two off them on inside the bracket

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.880
.

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.860
We open a cuddly bracket to say there is an other of result annotations on we say ad,

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:07.740
Did it result?

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:09.000
This is singular.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.900
On day,

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:10.950
we have to say,

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.200
What is the property name and the column name?

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:13.790
So in this case,

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.780
the column name happens to be user underscore idea,

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.600
and then the property is nothing with the user.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:21.090
I d.

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:22.350
With camel caps.

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.010
I copied the same thing.

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:25.750
Give a comma and then paste it.

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:30.220
This is gonna be created under school at on.

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:36.730
This is gonna be created at so the same thing I can copy from here and then based on then

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:42.440
change this to phone because we want to know the true record based on the phone number.

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:43.020
Of course,

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:48.250
the column limit also going to be phone on the 2nd 1 corresponds to the field here.

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:53.890
So one other thing that missing here is the assignment off auto generated I d.

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:56.030
And if you remember from the user deVeau,

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:57.560
we have toe add on other.

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.650
An addition called at the rate options coming from my back,

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:08.090
This package option is basically used generated kiss equals to true on.

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:11.590
You need to specify what is a key property which is nothing but I.

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:13.520
So if you're not done this,

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.850
then the auto genital ready will not be assigned to this contact object.

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:21.980
So let's go back to those salaries here and in the salaries.

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:25.020
You can see that we deceive a contact object.

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:26.240
We do some validations.

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.070
So if there is any validation,

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:33.650
enter here We are returning the same see object which is coming from the perimeter.

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:35.170
Andi similarly,

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:39.440
we're going check in the database with the record exists for an email or phone number.

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:40.630
If the answer is yes,

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:43.330
we're returning the same contact object again.

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:45.700
But if there is no allegation error,

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.830
then we're tryingto either new record here.

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:47.980
Now,

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:53.130
this is exactly where that use generated case come into picture that is now assigned to

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:53.540
this.

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:54.260
See,

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.780
on returning the same see object over here,

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:58.730
which is received in our contact,

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:00.950
sell it and unsuccessful,

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:02.160
adding the new contact.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.830
We have the contact object with the I D.

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:05.180
On.

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:07.140
The same idea is used over here.

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:10.830
So let's right click on a project and run this to check it out.

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:11.920
So I'm gonna run us.

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:12.490
Run on,

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:12.700
sir.

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:12.970
Well,

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:19.000
let's log in using the node at we know dot Co.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.630
As the email secret as the password.

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:23.120
It's click logging.

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:32.460
Let's are a new contract that's had the first contact your sham Andi Cinder,

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:38.300
as the last name email is shown at example dot com phone number.

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:46.020
Let's given our victory for number 98765 87654 I don't want to give any off the other

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:46.400
fields.

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:53.320
Let's give the country as India Andi States aviators because we haven't implemented the

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:57.750
view contact details yet to which we are actually trying toe redirect.

00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:59.920
This will give you for Not for,

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:01.100
but meanwhile,

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:04.170
a record for this should be added in the database table.

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:09.430
So let's click on save details and see if it works accordingly and you can see no.

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:13.010
But it says there is a former for because this is not available.

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:13.970
But importantly,

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:18.450
you can see that the ivy generated is passed is the Quietest Inc perimeter here.

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:19.340
Plus,

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:23.770
if I go to the beach to console select Star from users,

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:25.690
let's change this to contacts.

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:26.840
Andi.

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:28.180
Click on Run on,

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:28.660
You should know,

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:31.160
See that there is a record that were inserted.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:32.430
One chance Inder.

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:38.460
And so and so if I try to our another record with the same phone number or email,

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:43.380
you'll see that at 11 that a message comes for either email for number.

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:46.910
Let's take the name as Kishel Last name Ask.

00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:48.960
Come on email address.

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:50.100
Let's type your key.

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:53.260
Sure at example dot com phone number.

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:54.410
Let bigger the same thing.

00:07:54.410 --> 00:08:02.860
9876587654 Let me leave all of the things blank because they're not mandatory.

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:07.480
Let's click on the same details on Now you see that it says there's already a contract for

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:08.310
this phone number.

00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:09.160
Similarly,

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:12.880
in case if this were to be sham at example dot com,

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:17.770
I would have got the similar messages said there's a contact for this demon that send this

00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:18.060
back.

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:19.150
To be sure,

00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:23.150
let's change the last digit to say three.

00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:24.110
Andi,

00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:27.250
click on Save details on Once again I get a former four,

00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:30.830
but importantly at a card has been added in the database table.

00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:32.220
Notice that the user,

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:33.420
really rich of the foreign key,

00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:37.600
also has been assigned with the idea of the person who is locked in with this.

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:45.450
Now our add new contact model is really in the next few lectures that's implement view,

00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:49.650
contact details so that after successfully adding the contact,

00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:53.050
we should be reviewing the details that were added.
