00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.880
now that we have a distributable war.

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:03.240
Fine.

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:04.570
In this lecture,

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:08.510
let's run this world file on our local Tomcat,

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:08.680
sir.

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:10.970
One so I don't need to the eclipse anymore.

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:14.220
I'm gonna go toe clips and then sacred eclipse.

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:19.050
Say exit and open a finder window on desktop.

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.170
I have Apache Tomcat folder.

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:23.430
This is my applications are were folder.

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:29.820
There is a BIN directory which contains all the wineries boat for windows as well as Lennox

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:30.290
Macro,

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:31.050
etcetera.

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.090
On windows,

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:38.490
you simply have toe run the started dot backed by double clicking on that but on limits.

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:39.260
And Mac os,

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.340
we have toe run it from the command front or terminal.

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:43.220
Also,

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.630
we may have toe change a couple of permission.

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:46.720
So let's do one thing.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.040
Let's open the terminal on Didn't goto a new tab.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.940
That's gettinto,

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:53.560
our city desktop.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.870
We have a patch it on cut.

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.770
Then we have the BIN directory.

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:03.480
If you see that there are few shell scripts on the one that I have to run is the start of

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.250
dark message.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.630
But if you look at the permissions here,

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.010
it has only read write permission for me.

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.600
No execution permission for anybody.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.040
So if I take your dot,

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:20.430
slash startup dot and such and presented reconsiders permission denied dot,

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.150
slash start of dressage.

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:27.850
So we need to add the executive more also to the start of dot such So To do that,

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:34.530
we have to simply type ch more and then say for the user on the explanation and the file is

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:41.850
the start of dot and such press enter now if you see it is done so it's right here.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.440
You can see that there is an executive permission given.

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:45.850
Let's clear this again.

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.250
And now if I don't slash startup dot s edge,

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.100
you get another rather saying that Catalina door,

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.780
that such is not having the execute permission.

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.640
So this is a dependency by start of Dallas.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:05.680
And so we have to type your see how much more User plus X on were to say,

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.850
catalina dot and such press enter.

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.180
And now we can go and run the start of dark set.

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.810
So I'm going to use the arrow key to select the previous commander dot slash start of the

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:17.350
message.

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.170
If a press enter,

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.890
you can see on limits and MCA wears it simply runs this on a background and comes back with

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.520
a common front tomcat.

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:32.420
It started so I can exit this terminal and Tomcat would still be running to check if the

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:33.310
dunk it is running,

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.700
let's go to a browser and open local host Eijiro eijiro enter.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.210
That brings up a patch it Uncle homepage from the local installation.

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:47.420
Another hour Tom carries a pen turning and variable taxes the homepage.

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.460
If you trade access slash phone book press enter,

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:56.400
you can see it comes back with a fortnight for because the one that we were running earlier

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.480
was deployed on the hatchet,

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.820
hunkered within our product workspace.

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:05.840
So the deployment folder was inside our workspace with Right now this is coming from a

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:06.280
folder,

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.320
which is on destiny.

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.880
So now we have to deploy the war file onto Apache Tomcat.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:12.820
And to do that,

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.450
let's go back to the finder window.

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.110
You can see here that there is a bad that's full in.

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.440
All I have to do is tow Dragon.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.080
Drop this phone book war file onto here,

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.910
and because Tonka is running,

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.530
it is going toe automatically deploy because this is the hard deployment and you'll see

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:30.690
that the phone book don't.

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.250
What will be exploded into a folder here,

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.390
so I'm gonna drag this on.

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:36.750
Drop on over here.

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.490
Keep an eye on the folder.

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:42.140
The wall file will get exploded into an actual folder.

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.570
You can see that happened.

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:46.250
So there's a phone book project,

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:47.600
the Web,

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.920
enough classes with all the package classes and the configuration files.

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.950
Live with other 11 charts,

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.810
then views with all the J speeds and Jay Speer files.

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.190
And then you have the web dot XML,

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:00.140
of course,

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.450
assets with images than state knife.

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.700
I go here and then do a refresh.

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:06.250
You should know,

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.910
See that there is a phone book application working perfectly.

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:10.450
All right,

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.830
I know what application just works.

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:13.210
Fine,

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:17.750
so we can even check the logging and then see if this is going toe,

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:18.910
although the user to log in.

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:24.160
So let's give the email as we know that we know dot co password secret.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:29.510
Let's click logging and you see now that we are able to access all the details that we

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.050
currently have in our phone book.

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:38.530
So this is how you can deploy any war file on a local dunk it insulation the process off

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:41.700
copying the war file may differ on tour productions are were,

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.070
but in theory this is what actually you do,

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:45.700
even in the productions are also
