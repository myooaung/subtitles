00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.970
in this lecture,

00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:03.080
let's create a JSP call show.

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.760
Contact RJ's be under Babineau slash abuse folder,

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:11.820
which will look for object called contact in the request scope.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.150
And if it is found it's going toe display the details.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.500
If it's not phone,

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.030
it's simply going toe.

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:21.750
Put a message to the user that there is no contact for the given idee.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.620
So let's copy this theme.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:24.270
Right.

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.570
Click on views folder New JSP flight.

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.520
Best the name in the next section.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.730
Simply select your phone Bill J Street template click Finish on.

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.370
We already have a ready to use J Speak the heading for this.

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.860
I want to give it us contact details for idee on.

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:51.840
Then I want to give the i d off the request parameter on any request Parliamentary can

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.850
access with the help off an expression dollar,

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:55.770
madam.

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.170
And then say what is the perimeter?

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.420
That you want access In our case,

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:00.050
we want access.

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:01.740
The I decide Simpler to say,

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:07.550
Don't I d So this is equal and of requested Get perimeter off idee.

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:11.530
We also want to check if this contact object is not a lot.

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:12.650
Not so for that.

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:18.760
I'm gonna make us of Js Steel and for J still be toe include a title EG ready onto into the

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:19.560
tight library.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.950
I'll go somewhere here and then type less than percentage at tag Lib.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.280
You already called stew and wait for a second on.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.650
Then you can see a huge list comes up.

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:31.380
We need to select this job,

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:38.920
ordered Sunder com slash j space that j still stash code on the prefix preferred is See on

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:39.960
we choose the same thing.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.320
I can come down here and then say Sequel and if and then give the conditioners contact

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.420
tickles to Nagaland and displayed a message we already have seen Sequel.

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.200
And if in this use case,

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.010
let's see another conditional construct,

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:56.450
which is called Sequel and Choose,

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.750
you can prefer sequel and choose when you have multiple conditions to address.

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.720
So let's say C colon and in pest control space,

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:10.800
you see that there is a secret and choose andan slash sequel and choose inside this for

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.010
each of the conditions here to use something called Sequel and then I'm gonna take your

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.240
sequel and then best equals toe.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:26.550
Here is where else dollar request scope don't contact equals toe none.

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:27.900
Is this true?

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:34.060
Then we have to give the output inside this So the auto basically and Adam message hedge

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.990
five plus equals toe text danger.

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:47.340
And then we'll say you're sorry we didn't find any contact with Eylea and then with a

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.250
dollar for um dot idee and included this condition fails.

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:58.600
You can are multiple other conditions on an optional sequel and other ways to indicate an

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.510
else option or the default option.

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:01.810
If all the conditions fail,

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.660
the sequel in other ways will be executed.

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.210
So I'm gonna take your sequel and otherwise on inside that.

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:14.230
Now I want to display the detail to the contact because contact is not equals to know.

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:20.310
Let's add two sections on the left side of the image off the person and on the right side,

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.420
I want the details off the person.

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.520
So to create a two sections,

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.170
I'm simply going to use deal class,

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:33.990
equals tow rope and add two columns in it may be the first column is a smaller one because

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:37.850
there is only a small image on I'm gonna have here.

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:42.120
Deal clasp equals toe call that MD dash,

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.000
maybe four or five.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.750
I can use,

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.720
and another one is going to be the remaining seven out off trouble.

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.510
Because that's some off fire on.

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.700
Whatever I give you should be 12.

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:55.240
Andi,

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.200
that's what I'm giving,

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:56.660
you know?

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:57.360
Of course,

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.070
if you wandered multiple columns,

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:04.170
then some off grids used in all the column should become equal to or less than 12.

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.440
So the 1st 1 is going to be just an image here,

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.570
so I'll take your I am g classed equals toe.

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:12.640
I am G dash company.

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.460
SRC equals toe.

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:17.510
This is the After that,

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:18.320
we wanted you.

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:25.180
So I'm gonna take your dollar contact dot After it is possible that contact our outer is

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.100
either null or an empty string.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:32.760
We can display a default profile picture also here because this is an expression on Beacon

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.760
.

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:33.930
He was eternally operator.

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:34.660
Toe check,

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:36.820
if after is equals to an empty string.

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:38.010
If so,

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:39.860
display a default after.

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:41.760
We'll do that a bit later.

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.360
So that image tag is over the rest of the readers.

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.640
Let's go here in the second section and then are they table class,

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.960
off table on inside the table.

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:57.050
I'm gonna have one drove for each of the field value with a label in a value.

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:02.050
So let's had here d r with the two theories in it.

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.210
The 1st 1 is just going to be a label.

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:09.660
Let's type your first name on the 2nd 1 is going to be the value for that,

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:16.520
which is nothing but a dollar contact dot First name on the same thing.

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.660
I have to copy and paste for each one off this now.

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:23.110
So I'm religious copy dissection based over here.

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:29.010
This is going to be last name on and last name here as well,

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:32.100
and I have to do another eight off them.

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:33.320
So I'm gonna pause the video,

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:34.460
complete the table,

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:35.540
and then come back again.

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:39.360
So I have completed the entire table.

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.860
Now let's go and try to access this summer.

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.150
J speak combination to do that.

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:45.620
Let's right.

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:46.870
Click the project.

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:47.970
Run us.

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:54.120
One answer would the sun will get restarted on will no open that in the browser.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.110
If I type your manually,

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:58.150
for example,

00:05:58.150 --> 00:05:59.420
view bash,

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:01.220
Contact Dutch details.

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:03.970
Question mark Heidi equals toe for example.

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:04.440
One.

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:10.980
This should not give you the details because only love being you should be able to access

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:11.710
However,

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:12.890
if a press enter,

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:16.710
you can see I am getting the details off that person.

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:18.020
Shantz in the etcetera.

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:19.100
I don't have an image,

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:19.460
though.

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:23.160
This shouldn't have happened to address this issue.

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:24.540
Let's go to the view.

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:25.650
Contact Sarette.

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:29.830
Copy this Ural pattern and open the log in check.

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:32.320
Filter where I have toe pace.

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:34.200
This as an additional Europe.

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:35.380
So for every year.

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:40.140
And that requires at indication you have to come here and then at the neural pattern.

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:42.570
Let's save this restart.

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:43.190
Tomcat.

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:47.640
Go back to the browser.

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:50.930
If I now refresh because I'm not logged in,

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:53.580
it should simply take me back to the log.

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:54.070
Inform,

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:58.930
let's click on Reload here and you can see now it is predicted on.

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:00.930
Only long been users can access that.

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:02.390
So if I go here,

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:08.760
be note at you know Darko on secret is the possible Let's press enter now I'm gonna come

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:09.930
here and then type,

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:10.740
view,

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:12.640
dash contact details.

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:13.990
I d equals to one.

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:16.190
We get the details of the person.

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:16.640
Of course,

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:19.370
I need a default profile image over here.

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:21.250
Let's address the same thing.

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:26.090
What we do is we go to the Google images I'm gonna go type your images that google dot com

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:31.550
and look for default profile Alta begin many off them.

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:32.750
Let's speak one off them.

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:35.070
I'm going to simply select this right click on,

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:36.820
then say same image,

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:40.080
as I'm supposed to say that in our projects.

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:40.810
A set folder.

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:41.990
So under desktop,

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:43.600
I am my training workspace.

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:51.650
We have the phone book SRC under Main rabab assets we have styled here.

00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:58.890
Let's also create a new folder called Images and then give the name as Let's a Default dash

00:07:58.890 --> 00:07:59.390
profile.

00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:08.460
Let's click on Save Come back Toe Eclipse If I come over here under wraps a sense if I

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:10.540
right click the assets and do a refresh,

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:17.250
I should see a new folder called Images On Inside that I have default profiled R G P E G.

00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:19.200
So let's go to the jsp.

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:19.650
No,

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:21.520
and then say,

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:23.350
if this contact are out,

00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:25.170
are is an empty string,

00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:31.280
which I can check by just using the double equals two and a string like this Notice.

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:32.240
Inside the expression,

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:33.790
I can use a single ports here,

00:08:33.790 --> 00:08:34.600
not a problem.

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:36.360
If the answer is yes,

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:39.400
then I have to give a different picture here,

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:48.100
which is nothing but don't slash a sex slash images slash default profile dot g p e g.

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:51.250
But if it is not an empty string,

00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:54.360
then I have to give contact or alter its cells.

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:57.010
So let's save this restart.

00:08:57.010 --> 00:08:57.650
Tomcat.

00:08:57.650 --> 00:09:01.490
Go back to the browser.

00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:03.050
Let's close this time.

00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:06.960
And then if I do a refresh since I've been logged off,

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:09.450
most probably it should take me to the log in page.

00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:13.490
Let's log in again and press enter.

00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:16.080
Look for view.

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:17.060
Contact details.

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:18.250
I d equals toe one.

00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:22.640
I press enter and you can see that we got a default profile picture.

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:23.440
However,

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:26.280
if I go and add a new contact over here,

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:31.550
let's get the first name as Robert Last name Miller Emailer.

00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:37.000
Does that say Robert Miller at example dot com Phone number.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:37.430
Let's give.

00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:38.620
Some are between,

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:46.490
um but so I'm gonna give your 9786756453 the outer.

00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:49.570
I can give it from one off my website link.

00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:55.650
So I have your http double slash cave in or dot com slash profile.

00:09:55.650 --> 00:10:03.190
It just slash men slash 1 200 Any number I can use.

00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:03.800
Let's say,

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:04.950
for example,

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:07.250
three dot jpg.

00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:10.810
So if I copied this and open that in a new time,

00:10:10.810 --> 00:10:13.250
this is how it's gonna look like.

00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:15.590
Let's close this comeback here.

00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:17.490
Let's a street address.

00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:18.670
I want to leave it blank.

00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:19.570
Dallas,

00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:20.740
Texas.

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:22.500
Onda country.

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:23.490
Let's say USA,

00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:24.410
let's click.

00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:25.910
Save details And remember,

00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:27.700
when a click save details,

00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:30.100
it's going to send a post request toe.

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:31.250
Contact some blood.

00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:34.540
It makes it of the service service mixes off Deol.

00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:41.400
Act this detail as a Ricard comes back with a newly generated ivy and then uses that Islay

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:47.150
toe wiz it view contact details on Hopefully if everything works well when I click on saved

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:53.350
it is I should be able to see the details off this record on you can see it works just fine

00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:53.350
.

00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:55.980
A couple of things to notice your for example,

00:10:55.980 --> 00:11:02.740
If I don't supply I d equals two and then press enter Idea is equals to know in our

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:03.570
separate here.

00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:08.680
So this condition is now satisfied and it simply redirects me back to the homepage.

00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:13.670
So if I pressed enter here now you can see I'm taken to the homepage.

00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:14.520
However,

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:17.680
if I go and type in here something,

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:18.000
Let's say,

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:18.710
for example,

00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:25.730
777 I don't have a 97 77 Obviously it's gonna come back and to tell me that there is no

00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:27.000
record for this I d.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.220
So if a press enter,

00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:29.100
you can see regard.

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:29.860
Sorry,

00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:35.290
we didn't find any contact with 87 77 and that's coming not from the sunlit,

00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:37.570
but from the jsp in Jsp.

00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:39.380
We took care off that over here,

00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:41.950
saying that if contact is now,

00:11:41.950 --> 00:11:43.550
we're giving you that a message.

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:51.180
But if I type here a SDF which is an all funny medical value here and that is when in the

00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:54.780
celebrate we have checked is it equals to know it is not,

00:11:54.780 --> 00:12:00.440
not because it is the SDF on we're trying to convert that airs the F into an integer on

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:02.740
that throws and unchecked exception called number.

00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:03.550
Former exception.

00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:08.660
We're not handling that it's being handled by the summit container,

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:09.630
which is up a tree trunk.

00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:13.470
It on a party tanker is simply going to give me the statures,

00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:15.060
which is not good,

00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:19.130
because we now lost the common look and feel off or application.

00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:22.400
So we know that this is an internal saltwater.

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:22.670
Also,

00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:23.440
their status.

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:28.190
This fire under also the exception is number formal exception.

00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:32.900
So if you want to have separate pages for separate exceptions,

00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:33.670
you can have it.

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:37.980
Or you can have one for each off the status court,

00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:38.680
for example.

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:42.920
For former for you can have one for 500 you can have another one.

00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:45.180
So to configure this,

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:47.240
let's goto our vendor XML.

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:49.910
So after the welcome finalist,

00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:58.020
let at a section for error pages So the other page can be because off a l court like this,

00:12:58.020 --> 00:13:00.400
maybe I can have your for not four.

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:04.910
And then I have to give what is the location that your Tomcat it's supposed to with it,

00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:11.480
and that's supposed to be starting from slash and then you can give a location off your JSP

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:12.940
or probably a urinal.

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:14.090
Putting off its summit.

00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:15.550
I'm in arcade.

00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:18.030
Let's give your weather and have slash views.

00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:20.440
Slash Let's say for example,

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:23.240
Page not found dot gsp.

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:25.880
We don't have this jsp so we need to create one.

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:26.910
Likewise,

00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:32.710
I can also have one more for 500 so I'm gonna just copy this and then based over here to

00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:33.360
the status quo.

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:34.750
It is going to be 500.

00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:36.330
The Rabbi nephews.

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:41.580
Let's call it us probably server dash and dot tsp.

00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:42.770
So instead,

00:13:42.770 --> 00:13:43.610
off other code,

00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:48.660
you can also say exception type and give a specific exception that you are interested toe

00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:49.000
handle.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.670
So we don't have these two files that create border than I'm gonna create.

00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:59.150
This first star entered our jsp and then right click the views.

00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:03.850
New jsp fight based it.

00:14:03.850 --> 00:14:05.210
Click next.

00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:07.710
Make sure that we're selecting our phone book.

00:14:07.710 --> 00:14:08.670
JSP template,

00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:09.740
click finish.

00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:13.880
Probably I can just type your internal sorrow.

00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:14.300
Erin,

00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:17.460
I'm gonna give a simple message.

00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:24.250
Er p There was an adult Why processing your request?

00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:31.730
Police straight after something or contact.

00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:36.210
Help this slash B In this page,

00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:38.460
if you want to display the details of the exception,

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:42.680
you can also are the page director and say that hit dissident adult page.

00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:44.010
Give me an exception object,

00:14:44.010 --> 00:14:49.300
and then you can start accessing the exception implicit object as well for No,

00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:50.240
I'm not gonna do that.

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:51.850
So let's say all the fights.

00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:55.580
Let's go toe that dot xml copy this filing page,

00:14:55.580 --> 00:15:04.260
not found dot Jsp right click views New JSP file based The name next,

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:09.980
Make sure to select the phone book GSP template click Finish I here I can say probably

00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:10.640
hoops.

00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:15.050
The page you're looking for does not exist.

00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:18.330
And if you want,

00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:22.100
you can display some nice for not for image on If you want,

00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:27.710
you can Goto website called pixel be dot com Look for any image.

00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:28.210
For example,

00:15:28.210 --> 00:15:33.500
if a type your page not found press enter and there are some images over here some

00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:36.580
sponsored and some non sponsored three of them.

00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:38.600
So I'm gonna select this one.

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:40.580
It is your three downloads.

00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:41.750
I'm gonna click on this.

00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:42.830
It says,

00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:44.070
What is the size you want?

00:15:44.070 --> 00:15:46.120
I'm gonna look for a smaller one year.

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:50.050
So 12 80 by 6 55 Click on download.

00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:52.680
It will probably ask me a capture here,

00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:56.440
so click on that download once again,

00:15:56.440 --> 00:16:03.370
I'm gonna save it onto my images folder under the assets I'm gonna call the thirst for Not

00:16:03.370 --> 00:16:04.830
for like,

00:16:04.830 --> 00:16:05.310
Sam.

00:16:05.310 --> 00:16:07.250
Close this.

00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:09.280
Come back over here.

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:16.400
Maybe you can refresh the images folder here and see that it is former for dog tepid g pg

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:25.520
So I'll tape your I am g SRC equals two dot slash a sex slash you may just snatch for not

00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:27.710
for George epic Onda.

00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:30.480
Also a class off I Am G Dash Company.

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:33.110
And let's close that.

00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:33.850
Save it.

00:16:33.850 --> 00:16:35.960
Restart Tomcat.

00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:40.610
Let's test bought off those scenarios.

00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:43.940
The This is where I type ideas equal to a SDF on.

00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:45.190
If I pressed Enter,

00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:48.430
I should get the log in page because I haven't logged in.

00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:53.320
So let's first lugging on dragging we know I've been or dot co secret.

00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:53.590
First,

00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:55.950
enter Onda here.

00:16:55.950 --> 00:16:59.300
I'm gonna take view contact details.

00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:01.010
I musical toe a SDF.

00:17:01.010 --> 00:17:03.790
That's what I want to look for on this time.

00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:07.780
It should simply come back and say Internet star wherever there was another while

00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:08.770
processing your request,

00:17:08.770 --> 00:17:10.860
please try after sometime or contact help there,

00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:11.680
so that's OK.

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:16.730
But if I type here some page that I don't have let the phonebook slash a.

00:17:16.730 --> 00:17:22.050
Some are between text and they should come back with our for not for Paige.

00:17:22.050 --> 00:17:23.210
So with this,

00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:24.930
our view contact details,

00:17:24.930 --> 00:17:28.030
use cases and dressed in the next few lectures,

00:17:28.030 --> 00:17:33.170
let's try to get the details off all the contacts that I user has
