00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.730
among the current operation.

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:04.090
Let's also try the delete operation.

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:09.330
Although we generally don't believe a record permanently from a database table,

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.370
this is called a hard village.

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:12.160
Instead,

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:17.890
what we do is we add a column here indicating whether the record is active or inactive.

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:24.510
Consider you have a database table called Product On that are being showcased on a website

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:24.510
.

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.560
There may be some products which you don't want to sell anymore because they're not being

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.210
manufactured.

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.930
Are for one of the reason you don't want to believe the product record,

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:38.190
but instead you simply have to say the product is not going to be sold anymore.

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.740
So you say it is discontinued or some kind of flag,

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:46.730
so that in case if you're generating a report for an older date range,

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.470
you still have the product.

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.200
But for selling purposes,

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.020
you don't want the product anymore for showcasing on a website.

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.550
Human say,

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:00.650
give me all the products that have a value off discontinued equals two false.

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:02.270
But for the reporting purposes,

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.450
you can always say select start from products.

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:05.400
So in this case,

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.700
I want to show you how do you delete data card permanently so Let's say I want to delete

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:15.510
this card number nine because I have to start over here so true that let's go back to our

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:16.750
eclipse right?

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:18.780
Click on the programs package.

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.190
New Charla class That's college desk.

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.540
Delete customer press Enter.

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.550
Forgot to add the main function so you can take main control space.

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.980
Enter and we get the main function over here.

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:32.790
And,

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:33.990
as always,

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.160
we want the deal factory dot Get customer deal.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.190
That statement we need.

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.850
They're gonna copy that and then paste over here.

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:41.740
Onda.

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:42.250
Of course,

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.090
we also want toe through over the exceptions.

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.390
Let's also say your deal will dot delete customer.

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.680
So instead of deleting the customer directly,

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.470
you can check if the customer exists or not,

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:57.820
and then you can try deleting.

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:58.560
But in this case,

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:05.020
I just want to delete the record number nine and then give a statement saying Customer with

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.990
I D nine is deleted.

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.000
Let's try to run this first and let's see what happens.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.290
And again because of the auto commit.

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.090
This record gets permanently deleted from the DB as well,

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.810
and it is customer with 80 nineties deleted.

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.350
So if I go back over here around the select star from customers.

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.420
You see that the record number nine is gone.

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.890
But what if I try to run this again?

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.060
It's going to send the SQL delete statement.

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.150
But of course,

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.750
the update counter zero not an exceptions.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.630
Let's see what happens over here.

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.270
And you can t It still says customer with Eileen line is deleted.

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:49.560
So this is the reason you may want to first check by saying C one equals two dear Would not

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.670
get customer by idea off.

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:52.220
Nine.

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.800
Maybe you can give a variable here called idee.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.450
Let's type int ID equals toe nine.

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:58.760
Andi,

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.930
this should be idee over here.

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:01.920
And of course,

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.820
this answer should be idee.

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.290
So I'm gonna add your i d.

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.980
The C one has to be created as a variable off customer.

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.510
Davey did that on.

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.070
I'm only going to delay it by saying,

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:17.900
if C one is equals toe No,

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.260
that means the record is not fun.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:26.160
I can tell here that no data found for I D plus I d.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.150
But if it is found,

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.660
then I want toe do these two operations.

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.170
I'm gonna cut that funder and then paste it over here.

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:34.660
So I saved this.

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.620
Run the court once again.

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.360
This time it will say no data phone for I d nine.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:46.070
But if I changes to 12 you can see that the recording but will exist.

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:47.470
So this is not true,

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:48.260
Onda.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.510
It gets dilated and I get a message.

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:51.490
Do it again.

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:52.960
Then it will go to the section.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.910
So I'm gonna run this customer with a little is deleted.

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:57.830
Iran it again.

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:00.790
This time it says no data phone for Ivy 12.

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.650
So there's a better way off handling deal it operations.
