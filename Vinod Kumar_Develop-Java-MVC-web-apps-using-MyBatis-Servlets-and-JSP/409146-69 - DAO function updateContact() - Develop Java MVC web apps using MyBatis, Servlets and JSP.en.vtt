00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.350
in this letter.

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:06.410
Let's write a deal function that can take the details off a contract from the contact

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:09.900
object and update the details in the corresponding record.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.750
So let's go to the contact Dio.

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.100
Let's close all other fights.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:19.730
Now we're addressing the you off the crowd operation.

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.830
So we have the create on two.

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.200
That's right here a function which is going to be a wide function.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.590
So it's gonna be a public wide.

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.660
It's holidays off date contact on the perimeter is going to be off type contact.

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:35.820
Let's call it s contact.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:36.350
See,

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:44.390
with a semicolon we need to use at the rate update animation from my buddies package Onda

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.790
map it within update statements adopted.

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.170
Stedman looks something like this You say update the table name,

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:56.430
which is nothing but contacts says said unusual column names here to give saying that first

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.550
name equals toe hash First name.

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:00.820
Come on,

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:08.180
last name equals toe hash Last name and this has to be done for all the remaining columns

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:23.610
and I'm will go fast forward this process so have given for all the columns except created

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.190
at because created it is the date and time off the object creation of the card creation.

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:29.480
So we don't want to change that.

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.870
I would.

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:35.230
And finally we also to say their ID equals toe hash idee.

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:41.180
So a single record is going to be updated based on the I d off this particular contact

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:41.850
object.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.300
So with this now,

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.280
our deal function is really in the next lecture.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.870
Let's have a look at about the service function that is going toe in walk this deal

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:52.350
function.
