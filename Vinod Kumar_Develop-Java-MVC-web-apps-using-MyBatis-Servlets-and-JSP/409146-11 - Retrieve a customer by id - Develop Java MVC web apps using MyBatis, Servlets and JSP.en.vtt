00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.030
in this lecture.

00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:04.830
Let's start with a true record based on an i D.

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.910
So let's go back toe clips.

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:12.570
Onda create a new program under the program's That's a New Class,

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:19.240
but call it as poetry customer by idee either public static wide main click Finish.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.580
Get it off the agenda that to do.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.070
And like in the previous case,

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.690
we need the customer deal.

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:27.240
So I'm gonna just copy this on then.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.190
Based over here,

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:31.050
it will automatically do the respective imports.

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.440
We have to still throw the exception from the me,

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.540
and now I can say dear would not get customer by idee off a number.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:41.690
Let's type here,

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:42.450
too,

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.450
on the written value off this.

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.400
Let's assigned this to see one with Stephen has not been declared.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:53.670
Let's press command one or control one on Windows toe automatically create that variable

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.050
off customer type.

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.080
Now I can check your if C one equals toe.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.890
Know that means there is no customer with that specific idea.

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:04.370
Let's do one thing.

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:07.300
Let's declare a variable called entirely equal,

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:13.700
stood to and then supply that over here so we can print that There is no customer for that

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.700
.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.050
I D So I type your sis out.

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:21.350
No customer data for I d on the i d.

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.530
But if it is found,

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.840
then we're gonna just print see one,

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.520
so I'll type your sis out,

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:28.120
See one.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.630
Let if I can run this on,

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:31.780
get the output,

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:32.830
so I'm gonna run.

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.380
This do is a valid i.

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.600
D.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.060
So we got the respective details.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.120
But if I type,

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.380
you're,

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.110
say 22 on the run the same.

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.120
It's supposed to tell that no customer data phone for i d 22.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.350
So that's as simple as it goes in battle for this lecture.

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:51.760
In the next lecture,

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.380
let's try toe modify the details that we have retrieved from the data bees.
