00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.610
if I click on the same details,

00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:09.860
but in here we get 405 because hits TDP post is not supported by the 11 separate in this

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:10.380
lecture,

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.110
let's are a do post matter toe handle this particular form submission.

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:17.570
So let's go back to over eye contact.

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:18.850
Sublet on.

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:25.750
Add a do post function by typing control space and then start typing D o p press enter.

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.250
Get it off these two lines from here.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:33.450
So the very first thing that you have to do in any controller usedto read the inputs coming

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:34.700
from the request object.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:35.430
In our case,

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.470
these are nothing but the farm fields that are sent by the user.

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.860
They're all accessible in the form of request.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:42.880
Don't get perimeter.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:50.620
Let's go back to the cell it and then type your string first name equals toe request start

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:50.620
,

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.100
get perimeter off first.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.250
Me and in the same manner I have toe create nine other variables.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.700
And using these variables,

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:06.330
we will create a contact object that needs to be sailed into the database.

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.360
So I'm gonna say you're contact C equals toe new contact and contact.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:18.210
It's supposed to be imported from our entity package and then see Dart set first name off

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.750
its name.

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.090
Likewise,

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.950
I have to do the same thing for the remaining nine centers.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.190
And now that I've called,

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.760
all the centers we know have to pass this tow service layer toe.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.910
Are this as a new contact?

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:34.870
Of course,

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:36.840
the salaries layer will receive this.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.340
Do some valuations.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.610
If there is any error,

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.360
it's going to give me back those errors.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.900
If there is no error,

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.160
it's going toe return.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:51.160
The contact object on this returned contact object will also have a newly generated idee on

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.160
.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.310
Once we take that,

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.650
we store it in the request cope and then proceed toe the next to Paige.

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.750
In case there are any others.

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.370
We're gonna store that better in the request scope and then respond to the user the same

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:06.350
contact form which will display those other messages.

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.240
So to do this first,

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:15.040
let's create our contact Service service equals toe new contact service.

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.240
They've created errors object,

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.340
which is going to be a map.

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:25.010
So it's a map from Jawara duty which take string and string as key value data types.

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:31.050
I'll call this as errors equals toe new Hashmat And now I'm going to say Here,

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.400
See is equals toe service dot add new user.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.680
Let's pause the contact object C and the others object,

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:40.770
which is errors.

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.430
Notice dysfunction doesn't exist.

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:44.900
That's why eclipses giving an adult.

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.050
But we're following the top down approach.

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:48.840
This function doesn't exist.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.550
We want dysfunction to be automatically created in the contact service,

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.340
and Eclipse can do that.

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.690
If I simply move the cursor on this error,

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:57.200
it says,

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:03.470
create a method called add new user contact and then map these the two parameters off this

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.150
in the context of this class.

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.690
And since I've also assigned this toe,

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.990
see it will define the return trip to be off type contact.

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.930
Let's give it a try,

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:19.830
and you can see that we got a public contact at New User and the first Parliament.

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:21.480
It is often contact the variable.

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:22.380
Let's see if you want,

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:23.650
you can change that over here.

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:28.200
The second bottom Italy the map on then the very believe is others.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.730
This is all fine for me.

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:30.720
For the time being,

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.750
I'm just gonna ignore this and return.

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:39.530
Now come back toe Are contact summit Now there is no error after the execution of this

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:40.080
statement,

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.330
you have to outcomes.

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:45.450
Either there is a contact object with the newly generated i d Are.

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.540
There is an editor's collection with the one arm or errors.

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.080
So let's check that.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.780
If errors dot size is greater than zero,

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.650
that means there are one or more validation errors.

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.260
So we have to store this errors in the request as an attribute,

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.860
so I'll do the same thing I'll call it as it enters.

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:09.750
The key is important because this is the one that is being used in the contact form dot jsp

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:16.670
on the the object that I want a store is at risk it since after that I have toe follower

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:18.830
the control back to this particular jsp,

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:20.190
which is nothing but this lines,

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:21.570
I mean a copy on,

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.850
then come back here and then face the same.

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.520
But if there are no errors,

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.630
then probably have to redirect the user toe,

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:35.590
view the details off the contact that is added newly so I'm gonna say else response.

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:36.040
Start.

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:41.140
Send redirect to a non existing your oral For now,

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:42.530
let's call it us view.

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:44.850
Contact details.

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:51.900
Question mark ID equals toe plus the I d off the newly added contact object,

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.710
which is available in si dot get I d as off.

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:55.880
No,

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.000
this Ural doesn't exist so often successfully.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.910
I think it's going to give you for not for,

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:04.490
but we'll clear the sublet and JSP combination toe.

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:08.200
Handle this request in the subsequent lectures at the time.

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.650
After adding a new contract,

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:14.640
you will see that you will be redirected to a page that displays the details that you just

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:15.050
added.

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:21.430
Since this service function is not ready it we will not be ableto test the working off this

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:24.320
application as off now in the next lecture,

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:25.490
let's implement this.

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:30.250
Add new user where at least the validation part we will be able to test.
