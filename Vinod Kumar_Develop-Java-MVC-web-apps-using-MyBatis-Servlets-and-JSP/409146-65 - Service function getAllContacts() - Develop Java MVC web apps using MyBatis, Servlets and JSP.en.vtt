00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.860
our deal function to get the list off all contacts Israeli.

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:05.130
In this lecture,

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.310
let's read a service function toe in walk dysfunction and then return the list of context

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:11.150
to the controller.

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:19.460
So let's open the contact sarees and then probably write a function called Public List.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:20.450
Off contact.

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:25.680
Get all contacts and no perimeters,

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.410
not even at us,

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.990
because there is no input from the you that there is nothing to validate over here that

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:32.570
also say,

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:33.950
throws exception.

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:39.400
Because our deal factory dot get contact deal through its entire exception,

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.570
we can simply straightaway,

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:42.050
say,

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:52.220
return deal factory dot Get contact Dio don't get all contacts on import list from Java

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.620
Util.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:59.940
That list at our service function is already since we followed this one liner approach,

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.010
we can do the same thing,

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:02.510
even for the previous function.

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:09.230
So let's cut this from here and then based it all here and then remove this line so service

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:11.260
functions are super simple.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:12.990
That's all in this lecture.

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.250
