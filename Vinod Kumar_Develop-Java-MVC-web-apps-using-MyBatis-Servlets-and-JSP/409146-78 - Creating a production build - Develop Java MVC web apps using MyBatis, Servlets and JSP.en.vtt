WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=LOCAL:00:00:00.000,MPEGTS:0

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.450
so application is now complete.

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:06.450
We need to deploy this onto a server like dunk it.

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:07.830
And if you're wondering,

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.150
I don't be running the project on the Tomcats.

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:12.760
There were right now the answer is yes,

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.340
but the dunk it is within a clip.

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:19.970
So if close eclipse the tankers that will be shut down on did you will not be able to

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.020
access the application anymore.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.870
So we need to create a production build,

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:26.880
which is nothing with a war file,

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.650
which is the market that can be given toe any server for the deployment.

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.990
Creation off approximate build is very,

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:34.900
very simple.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:40.060
I'm gonna first stop the Tomcat server and collapse the product structure over here.

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:41.950
Let me close on the files also.

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:44.700
If I right click my project,

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.260
I have an option here for export.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
This is a feature prominent by clips.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.500
So we have an option straight over.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.210
That is export warfighter.

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.170
So I can click on this.

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.130
It brings up a dialog box.

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:59.490
It'll ask you what's the name of the project?

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:00.620
This is phone book.

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:01.000
Anyway,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.950
we rightly done that.

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.050
That's where this picked up automatically.

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:04.850
Ah,

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:05.950
what the destination?

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.980
This has to be a location along with a war.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:09.580
Finally,

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.060
I can take under,

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.340
then choose desktop.

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.580
So let's expand this and say I want it on desktop.

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.410
You can see that the name it is taken automatically as phonebook dot war Let's click Save.

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:21.760
And it also says,

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:27.070
target renting optimists for a specific sovereign time because we have that option under

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.190
our project properties called the Targeted From Time,

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:31.390
which we have chosen at the party,

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:32.060
Tom could nine.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.430
It has already selected,

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.130
and also there's only one sort.

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.490
Whether this configured eyes off now,

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.110
so there is nothing else going to be listed.

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:40.720
It also says Head,

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.000
Do you want to export the source scored within the war file?

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.150
I really you shouldn't export the source score unless it's a open source project.

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.570
If you're developing for a customer,

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.790
then definitely it's a big no.

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:55.180
Here.

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.940
Of course,

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.240
this is really not record because next time when you're tryingto recreate this war file on

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.970
the same desktop in Lenny,

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:03.650
were confirmed before overrating,

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.530
so we can skip that option.

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.530
Let's click finish on.

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.670
If you go to the desktop,

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.680
you should see Now there is a new file call phonebook dot What?

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.250
So this is our production file on?

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.010
Just to see the content off this,

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.520
I'm gonna open a terminal.

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.650
Let's go to a nuta on here.

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.260
I can say city they stopped.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.660
That's the location where that war foil exist.

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.090
So you can check your that.

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.950
I have the war file called phone Book that were here,

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:36.960
and we can use a command called Job DVF the four table of content.

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:44.130
We forward booze fr specifying the filing and then the phone book dot What this is gonna

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.690
list are all the files that are available in the phone book Start.

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:48.010
What?

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.170
So if a press enter,

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.060
you can see that it's showing me the list off all the fights.

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.810
There is a Madonna folder and some content,

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.210
So this is really not required by Apache Tomcat.

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:03.530
Then you have the Babayan.

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.920
If Lebanon had a fuller called classes and then classes has all the classes in the

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.270
respective package folders,

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:11.450
as you can see over here.

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.600
And it also has the my brother's conflict dot xml.

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:16.000
Remember,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.280
in our eclipse,

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.320
this is under resources folder,

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.490
but it's been copied over here,

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:22.150
and then we have the views Fuller,

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.200
also along with the Daleks family.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.940
And then you have the Liberte consisting of all the jobs that we have added through.

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.580
Maybe Independence is along with the contents of the of about folder,

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.500
which is nothing but the assets,

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:35.650
majors and strikes.

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.510
The other way to do is tow makers off me.

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:39.780
One.

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.140
Now May 1,

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.250
comes with a few goals on one of the bullets called Package.

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.940
Depending on what kind of project is this,

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.340
an appropriate job file or warfare will be created.

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:52.420
Remember in our pond,

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.970
Alex MLB has something called packaging on the packaging,

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:56.720
says one.

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:05.840
So I'll have to do is tow right like this and then Goto Rana's run as May 1 bill now may

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.220
even build will take a few parameters,

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.230
and the perimeters are nothing but the goals.

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.140
Some of the goals are listed over here like may want clean.

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.700
This will actually clean the Target folder.

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:17.310
Basically,

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.440
all the generated artifacts will be removed from here.

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.280
Let's go back to the May 1 run options,

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.740
so run as may when build an against a few other option that they may when install.

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.410
If you click on this,

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.930
this is going to compile your job decor.

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.410
It's also going to run any test cases.

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:34.950
If you have,

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:41.740
it's gonna create a job file in this case war file and then installs that on the Memon

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:42.530
Repository,

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:45.680
which is our Home folder Dark timeto folder.

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.370
The report that we don't want to really install that on to our repository.

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.900
We just want to create a distributable war file.

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.960
So let's go to the main one build with the triple dot here,

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.750
and you can mention here a space delimited multiple goals.

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:02.600
Some of the bulls have dependencies.

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:03.400
For example,

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.510
if your packaging your project,

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:09.170
then you don't have to give compiling tests because that included automatically.

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:16.760
So let's give you a clean space and then package 13 removes everything in the Target folder

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:22.990
package will run a goal called Compile test and then does the packaging part,

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:24.810
which is not creating it Warfare.

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:26.520
All I have to do is tow.

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:31.060
Click the run button over here if you're doing it for the first time.

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:35.550
Memon has to download a lot off jar files for this particular process itself.

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:37.370
But the second time onwards,

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:38.950
this will be a bit faster,

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:39.890
since I want.

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:44.160
Eddie created war files using May 1 for other projects,

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.460
so the based job friends have already been dominated,

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.070
so it would be a little bit quicker than probably on yours.

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:51.160
That's click the run,

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:55.440
but and find out and you can see some activity on the console here now.

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:59.510
And I have a failed build here,

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:01.140
So if I scroll up over here,

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:04.180
you can see that it comes back with an exception.

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:05.440
The several a p A.

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:08.110
Is not found in our application,

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:10.360
and if you observe carefully,

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:13.470
we don't have the Sunday people in our mainland.

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:14.290
Dependence is,

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:15.430
we added.

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:18.350
The subtler dependence is from Apache conquered.

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:20.120
So this is the library,

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.530
which contains the sunlit A P A.

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:24.620
Whereas memory,

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:26.600
when we're going to look for those in this,

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:29.430
obviously we have are the summary Perry also.

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:31.540
And to add the celery Pierre,

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:37.630
let's go on our another dependency over here by going back toe envy and deposit to dot com

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:41.550
and look for some late press enter.

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:43.650
This is the suddenly page,

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:46.990
our several a p a last updated on 2018 April.

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:53.880
Let's select the latest worse images forward zeroed one copy the dependency and then come

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:54.700
back toe.

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:55.430
May 1,

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:59.350
ponder XML and then paste it formatted and save it.

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:06.950
And now you should see that a summit AP A also has seen downloaded Let's Run the Melon

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:14.120
Gold's Once Against I'm Gonna Go Rhetoric on phone book Project runners Memon Build Clean

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:15.400
and Package should either.

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:17.150
The two bulls that we want to run.

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:18.550
Let's click on Run,

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:26.070
Let's put screen the console and you can see it says Build a Successful.

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:33.470
And it has created a jar file with the extension dot war on the name it has taken from the

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:35.450
name of the artifact Washington.

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:38.220
So you can also change this in your palm,

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:38.790
the XML,

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:41.350
by specifying what is the final building name.

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:44.670
So you can goto the build option over here and then say,

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:45.100
Hey,

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:47.630
no matter what it artifact early in Washington.

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:52.900
So the final building name should be phone book so you can give something like this.

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:54.310
Save it.

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:56.390
Let's run the package gold.

00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:56.870
Once again,

00:07:56.870 --> 00:07:57.950
I'm no right click,

00:07:57.950 --> 00:08:07.420
but on this Mylan boot Ondas a clean package Stender on this time it should be quicker

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:13.770
because it's already has all the dependencies request on a day and you can status.

00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:16.280
Phonebook guard what has been created,

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:20.020
which is inside the project slash target for low.

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:21.870
So if I go back over here,

00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:28.840
refresh the target for the ones you can see that we have a wonderful here,

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:31.620
which is the phone book down one on.

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:33.370
This is our production bill.

00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:34.870
In the next lecture,

00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:38.750
let's deploy this war foil on a local Apache Tomcat,

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:38.950
sir.

00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:39.250
Well,

00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:43.390
so that we can access our website without running eclipse.
