00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.070
in this lecture,

00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:07.700
let's discuss about Janus faced undertow globally are simply called Js Steal the James Bay

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:08.070
Center.

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:15.110
Take liberty is a bunch off tanks that help us write our JSP without having to worry about

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:17.350
Jolla inside the JSP five.

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:22.450
The JST in tax can be grouped into the following five sections.

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:23.620
Core tanks,

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:24.730
formatting tax,

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:26.850
skilled tax XML text.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:29.150
I'm JST l functions.

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.650
The cortex are the most commonly used J steel tanks.

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:35.890
They're different in the name space.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:42.500
It's city people and double slash job adults under com slash GST slash j still slash court

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.350
and usually perfect off see is usedto referred to the tax.

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.800
These tax provide programming ability toe our application.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:52.420
For example,

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:53.250
if I want oh,

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.740
create a variable and store that in a particular school are if I want an if condition to

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.740
Britain or if I want toe peter it over a collection of values,

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:04.450
we can use the court tags.

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:11.660
The formatting tags are usedto former and display text date time on numbers for

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.110
internationalized websites.

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.020
For example,

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.350
if you want to display the date in different format,

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.970
you simply have to use the former date time and all the formatting tags come from a name

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:22.450
space.

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:28.670
It's typical and double slash job ordered Sundar come start JC slash J still flashed f

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.750
empty and the preferred perfect is F empty.

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:38.430
J Steel also provides a way of connecting toe databases and fetch the values from the DB,

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.150
although this in order most followed approached by developers.

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:48.680
The jail still Estill Tag Library provides tags for interacting with RGB mrs such as Oracle

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:48.680
,

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.270
my SQL or any arguments for that matter.

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.470
It protects J Street tags toe celebrated of this connection pool executor,

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:02.420
acquiree executive and ex steel Deimel statement and also toe work with transactions.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.140
So the preferred perfect is SQL on.

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.150
All the tags are defined in the name space.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:13.910
It's too difficult and double slash john products under kansler jsp slash j still slash sq

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.910
.

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.380
In the very early days of Web development,

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.820
XML was considered as one of the most promising technology.

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:27.650
So Js still provided a support toe process and display XML content also so the Js steel XML

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.450
tags provide a jsp centric way of creating and manipulating example documents,

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.110
and this library has custom tax for interacting with XML data.

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.000
This includes passing the XML,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.550
transforming the XML data on the flow control based on the export expressions.

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:49.550
All the tags are defined in the name space age typical in double slash Java ducks under com

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:54.270
slash j space that j still slash maximum on the preferred prefixes.

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.830
X.

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.140
Apart from the tags that it provides,

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.390
J still also poets a bunch of functions.

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.820
These functions can be used within the expression language.

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:09.920
They cannot be used like tanks because their functions and most of these are common string

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.250
manipulation functions.

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.210
The perfect is effin on the name spaces.

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:22.600
Http colon double slash john Watson dot com slash jsp slash j Still slash functions in the

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:23.410
next lecture,

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.850
Let's come by whatever that we have learned so far.

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:26.670
As for a summit,

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.750
N J space concern put them in an NBC application.
