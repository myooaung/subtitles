00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.030
in this lecture.

00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:07.710
Let's see how we can pass perimeters from HTML form and then receive the same thing in a

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:08.990
sunlit process.

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:11.660
The same thing producing output to do so.

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:12.170
First,

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:13.790
let's are managed email file,

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:21.040
which is going to be under the maps so you can right click the about folder new HTML five

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.300
on the file name.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.050
I'm gonna give it us table dot html.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.760
Click on finish.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.190
We got a default html template.

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:34.350
Let's go and change the title as quality parameters demo.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.880
That's also do the same thing as our Hitch one.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:42.750
And also let's add a HR.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.900
We want to write a form over here because we want toe be ableto pass on the value to the

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:55.190
separate and the forms will have Action equals toe the U.

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:55.510
R L.

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:56.010
Patton,

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.850
corresponding to the subtle it.

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.440
Now I don't have a sunlit yet,

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.810
so I leave this blank for no on.

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:07.050
Then I'll hear something like Enter a number.

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.160
I'll add a text box.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.560
Input type equals toe text.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.260
Name is important,

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.720
so let's give it us numb.

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.540
If you are giving idee,

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:17.490
ideas are off.

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.400
No use for the server side cord so I did are only going to be useful within the front end,

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.750
which is typically 100 by JavaScript.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.540
Let's close the bracket,

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.830
and then we'll add a submit button by typing Parton slash button and then say your friend

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:34.500
table.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.500
So we want toe print the multiplication table for the given number.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:45.460
Let's save this and write a sunlit that can handle or receive this particular now.

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:46.900
So let's right.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:47.870
Click on the package.

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:48.260
Colder.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.800
We know that,

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.540
Ben and then say new sunlit.

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.950
Let's give a name of the class as table Sollett.

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.020
So that's the name of the class.

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.730
Super plus automatically has been taken as it's too deeply sublet in the next to step off

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:03.300
the desert.

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:04.610
It is asking,

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.960
what is the name to be given so name previously,

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:08.400
remember,

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.390
we give s one.

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.620
I'm gonna leave this as it is the Ural Wrappings,

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:19.120
though general practices you use a lower case on a hyphen format if you want multiple words

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.120
.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.650
So in this case,

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.360
I should have given it as a table dash tablet.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.610
I'll simply say,

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:25.830
here table.

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:26.710
So to do that,

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:27.790
you just are toe double,

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.390
Click this and then they splashed De even click on,

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.950
OK,

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.480
in the next step,

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.800
I have to choose whether or not I need constructed.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.050
I don't need constructors.

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.810
Do I need any off the lifecycle methods which I don't need?

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.700
I need to get I don't need do post.

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.920
So the only thing that I want is the do good function.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:55.640
I take on finish and I will see we have a sublet with the default settings over here,

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.860
so I'll get it off the comments in both these places as well as over here.

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:06.110
You must have observed that there is no added Web sunlight annotation over here.

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:11.750
And that's primarily because Eclipse has added that entry in the vab delectable.

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.090
So we don't want that.

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:14.920
So I'm gonna open the Abdul XML,

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:21.980
get it off the sunlit and sundered mapping corresponding to the same and save it and then

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.480
come back over here and are a great Web salad.

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.550
And the Ural pattern I want is slash table.

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:32.150
That's important.

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:33.530
Save it.

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:40.950
And now we have our solidarity since slash table is the Ural pattern for this particular

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:42.010
separate.

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:48.270
We go to the table knowledge TML and then say form action equals toe dot slash table.

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:52.440
This is how you in walk the sunlight from the client.

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.480
So the client makes a request o slash table and Tom card,

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.940
then will pass the control toe this particular summit and because we're gonna make a get

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:02.550
request,

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:04.950
it's gonna come over to the do get function.

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.590
The perimeter names are request and response.

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:14.750
Now all the details is sent from the plant will be available over here in the request on

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:19.260
the output that we want to produce should be produced toe the response object.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.600
Let first get the data from the user.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.090
So this is where we say request.

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:32.250
Don't get perimeter on the perimeter is a string and we give numb as the perimeter

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:36.160
perimeters are nothing but the name off the text box check boxes,

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.720
the radio buttons select drop downs,

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:39.600
etcetera so,

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.090
as you can see,

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:41.540
are given a name called Numb.

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:45.020
So this is the perimeter that we want toe writ to,

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:46.250
which comes with a string.

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:49.020
Even though the user might have entered and number,

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:54.140
it will still come here as a string because we are dealing with their heads.

00:04:54.140 --> 00:05:00.150
TTP which isn't that what the hypertext transfer protocol So everything is transferred us

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.720
text.

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.010
So I'm gonna assign this toe variable called input,

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:06.370
which is going to be off type string.

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.500
And now that I have this input,

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:14.530
I can now convert this into a number that's assume that the user is supposed to enter a in

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:15.030
teacher.

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:21.940
So I'm gonna type your into None equals toe in picture dark parts into off input.

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.000
Now that we have the intern,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:24.390
um,

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:29.570
we now have to produce an output that represents the multiplication table.

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:31.660
So before producing the output,

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:34.980
let's set the mind type toe html.

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:36.590
So response start set,

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:41.050
content to type and then type your text slash It's human.

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:43.600
Now we can produce the airport.

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:44.740
So to produce the output,

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:46.120
we need a writer.

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.890
So with their articles toe response don't get writer.

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:53.290
Let's clear that variable as print traitor.

00:05:53.290 --> 00:06:00.100
And now I'm gonna go there far loop where for int I equals to one islands down articles toe

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:01.510
10 I plus plus.

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:07.090
And then we want toe print out the multiplication table for numb inside a loop so I can say

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:08.450
her out dot print.

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:08.850
Ellen,

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:14.380
all I can use a print if also on the form it here is percentage D.

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:17.400
X person B equals two person be.

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:17.880
And then,

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:18.180
of course,

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:19.170
I need a break.

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:20.470
So to produce a break,

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:22.350
you can simply type your be on.

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:23.240
Remember,

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.890
these are all going to be returned as its TML.

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:28.750
So it's female doesn't care about the new line character,

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:33.350
so you can't just say flash in on the arguments are parameters For this person,

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:35.700
be symbols are nothing but numb.

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:41.380
And then I and then numb times I now our output Israeli.

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:42.900
It's printed in a loop.

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:44.300
Once it is over,

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:48.550
we can always say out dot close to close the output stream.

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:52.580
If you want to also give a message before printing all these,

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:54.530
you can say you're out dot print.

00:06:54.530 --> 00:07:01.130
Ellen hits Tree Table four plus Numb on Ben.

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:02.580
Probably something like this.

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:03.910
Let's say this.

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:08.120
And now let's go run the table knowledge team of this time,

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:11.880
so I'm gonna rightly conduct table that it's female run as answer.

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:12.190
Well,

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:13.700
if you're on your project,

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:15.570
then you have to navigate to table the rich.

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:16.040
Timmons.

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:18.250
I'm running the table that it's demon directly,

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:23.250
so we got the output off that it has entered a number.

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:24.400
Print the table.

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:25.460
I'm gonna type.

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:26.200
You're safe.

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:28.800
12 click on print to table.

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:31.110
It says your table for 12.

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:33.350
And then I got the table for 12.

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:35.080
So if you observe here,

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:37.720
the Ural has a question mark,

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:38.850
followed by name,

00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:39.700
value pit.

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:42.200
So this is called Qala listing perimeters.

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:47.450
Anything after the question mark is called the quietest in perimeters and become with name

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:47.770
value,

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:48.260
Peace.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.480
So this is how you handle requests?

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:53.650
Perimeters using a sublet.

00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:55.570
That's all for this lecture.

00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:56.690
In the next lecture,

00:07:56.690 --> 00:08:02.060
let's say some problems that this particular Sarette may cause on how to handle the scene.
