00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.750
we have seen both top down as a less bottom up approach from No.

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:05.180
One.

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:09.850
I will be following the bottom up approach with I start from the deal,

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:12.480
make use off the deal in the service,

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:19.290
make it at the service in the controller and then render the GSB as a view in the next few

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:19.920
lectures.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.060
Let's address the view.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:23.150
Contact details.

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.830
Use case were given an I.

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.460
D in the Ural in the form of quite a stink perimeter.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.250
We should be able tow returned the contact details off the person based on this idea.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:35.900
So,

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:36.460
obviously,

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.000
on the deal aside,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.030
we need a function that will take ideas.

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.250
A perimeter returns at contact as an object,

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.630
so let's go.

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:46.950
And just the same issue.

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.950
Let's go to the deal package.

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.020
Open the contact deal.

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.100
Let's add a function,

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.890
which is the get function.

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.660
So that's supposed to be the are off the current operations.

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:59.620
That's right.

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:05.840
A function here called contact is the return type that soliders get contact on the

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.540
perimeter is going to be either into our integer.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.510
I prefer to use the rapper types other than the primitive soil.

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:19.990
Type your integer I D with a semi colon on an annotation here at the rate select and then

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:26.580
give the query as select start from contacts where I d equals toe hash Eylea.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:27.700
Also,

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.540
we need to map the columns with underscores to the respective fields off this contract

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:33.020
object.

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:34.690
And we have done that here.

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:41.250
It's simply a matter of copying and then basing over here and now our deal function is

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.140
really in the next lecture.

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.780
Let's try toe right the service function that acts as a facade for this particular function

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:48.780
,

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.290
only to receive an I.

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.970
D from the controller and written the contact object from here.
