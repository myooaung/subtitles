00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.090
Let's take another example off a custom tag,

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.800
but this time we want to add a little bit more complexity.

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:12.300
So let's forced to define the usage of the tag and then come on and write the court

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.550
corresponding to the same thing.

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:17.170
Assume that we have here some piece off data,

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:18.190
which is common,

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:20.450
separated or cynical and separated.

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:23.470
Let's type idee name email.

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:24.620
Andi City.

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:26.820
Let's give a couple of values one.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.410
Let's give my name my email.

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:29.690
I did.

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:33.060
You know that you know dot co bangle er as the city.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:33.500
That's it,

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.900
too.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.280
John Doe,

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:46.280
John Doe at example dot com That's a Dallas on one more Jane Doe Jindo at example dot com.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.950
Washington Of course,

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.040
if you just to save this and go back to the Broza and then refresh,

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.580
you see,

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.990
you're gonna get everything in one single line because browser's don't care about these new

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:58.650
line character.

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.270
So if you want one below the other at the Mexicans,

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:07.560
a priest last three and then this will be considered the pre formatted text and they come

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.850
as is as you can see over here.

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:15.770
We want this to be displayed in a tabular format with the rows and columns to do that,

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.440
Let's assume we want to make use of a a custom tag.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.090
Let's call it as table.

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.440
But let's assume that it's part of our my custom text,

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.950
eerily so we can say we in the colon table on.

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.140
Let's do the same thing here slash b In vehicle and table.

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:37.990
It's giving me a warming or better because the prefix v indica response toe this tag

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.130
library on in that time library.

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.400
We don't have a tag called the table,

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.700
and that's why the error are warning.

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:45.200
That's coming.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:51.240
It is that unknown type B and vehicle on table so I can go here and then add another tag

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.130
just like this.

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:53.940
Whose name?

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.240
Because we use the name as table I can say table on.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.970
We have not mentioned where the class corresponding to this.

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.970
So we have a say Tiger class.

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.560
Let's assume it is cold out.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.000
We know dot web dot table attack again.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.790
Notice that we are following the top down approach.

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:13.280
We're going from JSP to Java,

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.500
but ideally,

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:20.150
a tag library developer would have created a bunch of attack classes mentioned all of them

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.220
in this particular configuration file,

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.870
and then a JSP developer will use that and what we're doing.

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.250
The reverse approach.

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.820
You can also see that the reader watering because it says that there is no such class phone

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.820
.

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.920
Call the table tag in this package,

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.630
so we'll come to that in a minute.

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.420
But at least if you go here,

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.670
there is no error at this particular line.

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:47.410
But compared to the previous example where we used these tags as empty tax because there is

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.940
no content in between open dragon closing time.

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.480
But in this example,

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.600
I have a content on.

00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:00.170
I want this particular tag handler class corresponding to this tag toe handle this and

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.730
converted that into a bunch off rows and columns.

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.450
It's TML table format and then substitute that output over here.

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:09.350
In other words,

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:14.690
the tag class should process this particular body content to do that.

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:15.240
First,

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:18.140
let's go and create a class called table time,

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:19.970
so I'm gonna copied his name,

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.010
right click on the package.

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.330
It's a new class on The last name is going to be tabled time.

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.220
But unlike the previous one,

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:33.410
which just heard something called tag support since this time we want toe process the body

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.410
.

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.920
Also,

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.250
there is a class called body tag support.

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:38.300
Onda,

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:39.140
like the name,

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:43.580
says it supports the reading off body off the track as well.

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:44.410
I'm gonna click,

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:49.510
finish and add a default cereal wash annuity just like the previous one.

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.810
Let's get off this comment on this time.

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.350
We want toe override a different function because we want to process the body.

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:57.430
So to do that,

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:58.850
let's go to the source menu.

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:00.030
Overrated.

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:06.880
Implement matters and here you can see there is something going do after body do innit body

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:07.940
do start,

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.470
do and attack all those functions.

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.390
And since we want toe,

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:13.550
read the content,

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:17.690
we will be writing or cord inside this do off the body.

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:18.440
I'm gonna say,

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:19.110
OK,

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:20.550
get it off the comment.

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:21.990
And like the previous case,

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:24.140
we want the JSP writer.

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:29.930
So let's declare a variable called jsp Writer Out equals toe.

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:36.620
We can simply call her inherited function called get previous out on J Spirit and needs to

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:37.700
be imported.

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.440
So if you observe previously,

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.970
we use their different mechanism toe get the all put stream.

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:44.480
So there we said,

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.750
there is a variable called page context.

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:49.850
On inside that there is a function called get out.

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:54.920
Whereas in the super class that we have over here body tax support there is a function

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:59.570
called get previous out which gives me the previously open or put steam.

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:00.890
So we're going to use the same thing.

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:04.490
Next we want to read the content of the body.

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:07.620
So that means we want toe read this particular part.

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:12.680
Nor does the actual content start from here and it goes still this line number 28.

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.020
To get this content,

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:21.790
we go here and then say get body content So there is a function inherited again from the

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:22.750
body tech support.

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:25.570
And this provides something called Get the String,

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:30.670
which is going to give you the string washing off the body on We can ascend this toe say

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:31.880
string content.

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:34.150
And if you go and the print out here,

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:34.780
for example,

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:38.340
at the salt content when I accessed the JSP,

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:40.970
that tag is being processed over here.

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:46.930
So this entire time the actual content is being accessed over here and then that prints me

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:48.180
on this council.

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:49.080
Let's give it a try.

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:53.370
Save this fine on then we start the Sarwar if you want,

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:54.910
so those are worried asking for us.

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:56.350
Toe restart.

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:58.330
Let's go back to the browser.

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:00.170
Refresh the page on.

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:05.540
I don't see any content over here because my tide handler is not producing any output.

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:07.030
But if I go back to the eclipse,

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:10.040
you'll see that the content is being printed over here,

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.450
including the new line in the beginning.

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:16.410
So we don't want any extra spaces before and after,

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:19.260
so we can as well they hear dart dream.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.190
So we get the trimmed washing off that on.

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:23.820
Now we have to process this,

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:28.470
and the way I can process is I'm going to split this entire text using new line character.

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:31.700
So I'm gonna get an array off four strings,

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:33.050
the 1st 1 being the header.

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:34.560
This is the second string.

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:38.930
This is the 3rd 1 and is the 4th 1 And if I take one line at a time,

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:44.320
each line corresponds to a row which consists off multiple fields using commas,

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:45.120
a separator.

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:48.360
I can split their further and then process the same thing.

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:51.330
And what I want to do is tow print table,

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:54.980
slash table with the corresponding rows and columns to do so.

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:57.140
Let's go here and then put a try,

00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:00.230
catch block and inside the try block.

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:03.710
What I want to do is to split this one ascended toe,

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:06.540
another string at a variable that's college dust.

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:12.110
Rose equals toe content to dot split on then slash n.

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:15.320
As the D limiter Rose is not created.

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:19.630
So press command one or controlled one and then get the variable created.

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:21.270
It's a string theory on.

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:27.400
All I have to do is toe loop over this particular Ari and then print a TRS last year for

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:28.120
each one of them.

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:35.860
So but first we need to give out dot print Ellen table and then a corresponding closing tag

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:35.860
.

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:36.450
Also,

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:40.910
let's give it in at once and let's consider the first row Toby ahead on.

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:44.150
So we're gonna are here out dot print Ellen.

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:46.270
He head for a table.

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:47.140
You have a T head,

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:48.680
the tea body and the T Foot,

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:53.320
so I'm gonna give the closing time for the same thing on In between,

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:54.940
I have to print one row.

00:07:54.940 --> 00:08:00.750
So let's say out dark rental and PR corresponding closing row for the same thing.

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:04.470
And now I need to give n number off columns.

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:04.650
Now,

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:05.260
In this case,

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:06.840
I have four columns,

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:09.510
but it may contain more columns also.

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:15.770
So we need to know process each one of them so far that I'm going to say values equals two

00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:19.850
rows off zero because that's the 1st 1 Dark split,

00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:21.940
and then I give a comma as a D limiter.

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:24.160
Values need to be created again.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:26.450
If I press command one or controlled one,

00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:29.270
you'll get the variable being declared on,

00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:34.650
which is an address so I can stay here for string value in values.

00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:37.950
This is where we're gonna say out dot printer,

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:39.570
then de hatch.

00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:42.520
You're using t Hitch because we didn't say that he had.

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:47.350
I don't want a plus value plus slash t hedge.

00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:48.510
Andi,

00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:50.230
if you carefully observe No,

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:56.540
we have a table slash table inside that we have a tea head slash jihad and inside that we

00:08:56.540 --> 00:09:01.630
have tr slash tr and inside that for the head slash t hedge.

00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:03.240
So if I save this,

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:06.400
my tomcat has automatically reloaded the context.

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:06.980
If I go back,

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:08.460
warrior and then refresh,

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:13.200
you can see that the table is despaired with the header so we can go to the page.

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:15.740
Source on the paid source will show you.

00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:21.120
But we have a table he heard on one row consisting off four ph.

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:21.920
However,

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:24.720
we want the rest of them also to be printed.

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:25.680
And if you want,

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:30.980
you can also say your table border equals to one for the time being.

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:32.360
Let's control this later.

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:34.570
But we can say border equals to one,

00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:36.310
so we will see some border.

00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:40.390
But now let's come back here after the he heard we want dirty body.

00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:43.540
So I'm gonna say older print Ellen the body.

00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:45.410
That's the table body.

00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:45.980
Andi,

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:49.930
this is going to contain multiple rows off multiple columns.

00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:51.430
That's pretty straightforward,

00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:55.940
because now we have here Rose where the first row has already been processed.

00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:59.300
Now we need to look or the second row onwards.

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:03.680
I'm going to say here for int I equals to one because we start.

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:12.050
They ended from zero envious keeping the 1st 1 I less then rose dot length I plus plus on

00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:16.560
now pretty much exactly what we have done over here should be done again,

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:18.000
including the TR.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.250
So I'm gonna copy this on the paste over here.

00:10:21.250 --> 00:10:24.710
We can't Redick late This so I'm gonna get of the declaration part.

00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:25.400
Plus,

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:27.030
this is gonna be TD instead.

00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:28.050
Off de hit.

00:10:28.050 --> 00:10:31.550
And one last thing is this is not rows of zero,

00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:35.980
but this is nothing but rose off I because we're inside a loop.

00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:39.360
We need to take the loop variable and then get that particular rope.

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:42.030
So let's goto our server,

00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:43.820
restart the server,

00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:45.520
go back to the browser,

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:47.620
refresh old here,

00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:51.230
you can see that we got the Its team will table corresponding toe.

00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:53.590
Whatever the data that we have inside this,

00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:56.440
now that we have created this table tag,

00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:59.440
we can use this for any kind of data.

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:02.600
Even if I have the data in a physical file over here,

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:03.790
for example,

00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:06.960
let's have a CSP for which is comma separated values.

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:11.180
I want to read the same thing and print the data so I can simply take here.

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:12.840
Let's get a couple off beyond.

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:14.700
So we have a gap over here,

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:19.870
and then we type your re Andy Coghlan table on they inside this particular attack,

00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:22.220
I can say percentage act,

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:25.940
include finally calls toe and lets it don't slash.

00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:28.540
Let's consider that people don't see us.

00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:28.950
Me.

00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:32.320
Which means I'm supposed to have people not see us.

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:33.310
We in the same location.

00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:34.200
I don't have one.

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:36.280
I'm gonna create a new file over here.

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:41.500
I'm gonna copy this and right click on weather New file Over here.

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:42.400
Of course,

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:45.940
the CSE file typically is associated with Microsoft Excel.

00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:47.150
Or in my case,

00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:48.330
it's called numbers.

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:51.510
Trace toe open the same thing using your default application.

00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:53.720
I don't need to open that over here.

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:54.560
However,

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:58.190
I want toe copy and paste some value from the Internet.

00:11:58.190 --> 00:12:00.180
So I'm gonna open this with a text editor.

00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:05.150
Let's go toe website called ma karu dot com,

00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:07.150
which gives you some market data.

00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:07.770
For example,

00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:08.600
you can see there is an I.

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:08.810
D.

00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:09.260
First name.

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:09.670
Last name,

00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:10.030
email,

00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:10.540
gender.

00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:12.150
I don't need this I p address,

00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:13.170
but I can adhere.

00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:14.070
Phone number.

00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:15.980
It's on a phone number.

00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:16.630
Type here.

00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:18.410
Let's add another one.

00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:21.020
Let's type it us address the data.

00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:23.050
That is gonna be street address.

00:12:23.050 --> 00:12:31.250
That's our one more city city Name one for state that I'd stayed.

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:39.370
I want lost four country That's at a country over here and you can rearrange them.

00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:39.960
For example,

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:42.750
I want the gender before emails.

00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:43.390
I have email,

00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:44.430
phone address,

00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:44.710
city,

00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:45.040
state,

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:45.440
country,

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:45.920
etcetera.

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:48.080
Know that I can have 1000 rows downloaded.

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:49.270
I'm gonna just get our own.

00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:51.250
Let's a 25 on.

00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:53.970
Either I can download the later or I can preview.

00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:56.650
That's I'm gonna preview that on then.

00:12:56.650 --> 00:12:57.060
Of course.

00:12:57.060 --> 00:12:59.690
I'm just gonna copy from here till here.

00:12:59.690 --> 00:13:02.490
I'm gonna press command Z copy.

00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:04.860
Come back over here and then paste it.

00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:05.700
Save it.

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:06.240
Now,

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:11.650
if I go back to my browser where I have the tag demo being displayed here,

00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:13.830
let's refresh that on.

00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:17.520
Now you can see the data coming from the CSE file.

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:18.270
So,

00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:20.880
irrespective how many rows and how many columns we have,

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:24.810
we can get the data by just using this particular tag.

00:13:24.810 --> 00:13:25.060
No,

00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:27.420
but this also can be customizable.

00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:28.270
For example,

00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:32.050
imagine I have your semicolon instead of Kama.

00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:38.040
Let's say I'm going to replace all the comma with semicolon over here so I can simply say

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:38.800
replace,

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:42.050
Find multiple times until I finish all of them.

00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:44.040
Let's close it,

00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:44.780
save it.

00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:46.890
If I come back to the brother and re Lord,

00:13:46.890 --> 00:13:49.450
you'll see because I don't have any comma here.

00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:52.020
All of them are considered as one single TV,

00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:53.160
which is not correct.

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:54.090
However,

00:13:54.090 --> 00:13:58.610
I can control that by supplying a perimeter over here or attribute.

00:13:58.610 --> 00:14:02.540
That's call it as dealing equals two semi colon off course.

00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:07.990
Now dealing is not a valued attribute corresponding to the definition off this table.

00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:11.330
Time on the definition of the table type is available over here.

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:12.690
That's where we're getting another.

00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:13.740
So if I refresh,

00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:14.650
I'm gonna get another.

00:14:14.650 --> 00:14:17.520
It says they're dealing is an invalid attribute,

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:19.050
according to the dearly.

00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:22.770
So let's go here and are the same thing to the table.

00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:25.450
I can say I want another attribute over here.

00:14:25.450 --> 00:14:29.640
Let's call people is the same thing on Let's call this as dealing,

00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:32.390
but it's not necessary because if the user didn't give,

00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:34.390
I can assume that this is going to be a comma.

00:14:34.390 --> 00:14:36.130
But for every activity define,

00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:41.440
you should have a variable on a setter in this particular class that's go to the class at a

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:43.020
member variable or here,

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:45.120
private string dealing.

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:47.450
Let's as a default value off comma.

00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:49.100
So if the user didn't supply,

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:50.470
let's assume a desk comma.

00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:52.510
We also have to provide a settled,

00:14:52.510 --> 00:14:55.380
so I'm gonna percent control space set dealing,

00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:56.350
Andi,

00:14:56.350 --> 00:14:59.500
you can also see I'm using the deal emitter in two places.

00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:03.110
This is one place on dime also doing the same thing over here.

00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:07.950
So we need to change this toe dealing on even here also as dealing.

00:15:07.950 --> 00:15:13.780
Now my court is really because here I have a variable called dealing using which I'm

00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:15.860
actually splitting the roast.

00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:21.130
Andi in the jsp we are supplying the dealing in case if it's not comma.

00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:22.430
So in case of the file,

00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:24.120
it is the common by different.

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:25.540
But as here it's not common.

00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:28.700
It's the cynical and I'm specifying that explicitly.

00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:31.270
So let's say while the files go back over here,

00:15:31.270 --> 00:15:32.490
refresh this.

00:15:32.490 --> 00:15:37.480
You can see that the data is split properly and destroyed in a tabular format.

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:43.160
Many of vacations will also supply some CSS styling and classes and so on.

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:44.180
For example,

00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:46.210
I don't want the border by default.

00:15:46.210 --> 00:15:48.810
I want control that from here very simple.

00:15:48.810 --> 00:15:53.120
We go to the table tagger job are declared one variable called border.

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:53.600
Let's say,

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:54.430
for example,

00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:58.650
private into border equals toe zero.

00:15:58.650 --> 00:16:04.070
So if the user dimension I will assume that the border is zero on this will ensure that the

00:16:04.070 --> 00:16:07.140
value for border is also going to be a numerical one.

00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:11.400
This is where I have given border equals toe one like this.

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:15.030
But we now have to give conditionally because if border is zero,

00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:16.760
we don't want the that tribute at all.

00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:18.800
But if barter is more than zero,

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:19.720
then I have to give this,

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:22.310
so I have to tweet this a bit.

00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:26.250
So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna use a percentage as over here.

00:16:26.250 --> 00:16:27.960
Unlike the print Reiter,

00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:29.830
J separator doesn't have a print.

00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:30.280
If so,

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:35.930
we may have to use string dot format like this on the former.

00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:37.300
It is gonna be this text.

00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:41.050
The value is going to be a value based on border.

00:16:41.050 --> 00:16:46.800
So I'm gonna say are if barter equals 20 that means I don't have to give anything.

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:48.920
But if barter is not zero,

00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:53.840
then I may have to give a string border equals toe plus border,

00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:55.760
plus the court for that.

00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:57.990
So this looks a little complex part.

00:16:57.990 --> 00:17:02.510
You will see that it's either going to have no border at all.

00:17:02.510 --> 00:17:04.600
Are Barda recalls toe a number.

00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:05.580
However,

00:17:05.580 --> 00:17:07.730
we have not declared this border,

00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:08.000
Toby,

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.240
An attribute over here that's going to declare the same.

00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:13.700
I'm gonna copy this and page next to that.

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:15.620
I call this as Barton.

00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:20.700
It doesn't mean that border has to be used by the user because he said required false.

00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:22.970
But if the border is not mentioned,

00:17:22.970 --> 00:17:24.150
there will not be any border.

00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:24.570
It also,

00:17:24.570 --> 00:17:26.760
if you go back to the browser refresh,

00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:28.600
you'll see that there is no border.

00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:31.310
But let's give a border and then check what happens.

00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:33.080
I'm gonna give border equals to five.

00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:34.010
Save this.

00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:34.970
Come back here,

00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:36.120
refresh the scene.

00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:37.750
I see another it says,

00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:40.850
unable to find center for active it border.

00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:42.770
The other is very clear.

00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:46.460
I have missed center for this particular variable.

00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:52.100
Let's add that I'm gonna type your control space and I've set border Andi,

00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:53.660
save this.

00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:57.260
Wait for several to restart our context to be reloaded.

00:17:57.260 --> 00:17:59.130
Come back over here,

00:17:59.130 --> 00:17:59.870
Refresh.

00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:02.090
You'll see that there is a spy pics.

00:18:02.090 --> 00:18:03.900
L border for this particular table.

00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:08.270
You can make this table time more flexible and more reusable.

00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:09.080
For example,

00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:16.420
what if somebody wants toe apply a CSS class for this So I'm gonna go on our CSS definition

00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:17.150
over here.

00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:23.360
Let's go to the beginning Where I have the head section I'm gonna adhere Style slash Stein

00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:24.910
I'm gonna copy and paste.

00:18:24.910 --> 00:18:31.280
A bunch of series is called over here that defines a class car bordered table that applies

00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:38.390
for the table tr tgt hit for all of them And I want to apply this CSS class toe one off

00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:39.270
these tables.

00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:41.790
So I have your V and equal and table.

00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:43.500
Let's say for example,

00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:47.450
I give your class equals toe bordered table.

00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:47.910
Now,

00:18:47.910 --> 00:18:50.840
one problem with this approach is class here is OK,

00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:53.410
this is the perfect to usage off CSS class.

00:18:53.410 --> 00:18:54.610
But remember,

00:18:54.610 --> 00:18:58.970
we need to have an active would called class in the TL day and eventually I need to have a

00:18:58.970 --> 00:19:01.850
variable in this particular Jolla class.

00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:02.560
Have a word.

00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:04.360
Class is a key word over here.

00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:06.370
I can't declare that as a variable.

00:19:06.370 --> 00:19:12.390
So that's why we will give you or something like CSS class RCs a style.

00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:16.060
And now I can give this as an attribute in the dearly,

00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:18.880
so I can probably copy this and pitch over here.

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:20.020
This is gonna be a C.

00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:24.560
It's a class on going to declare a string variable over here.

00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:28.150
Private string CSS class.

00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:30.160
I can attend an empty string if I want.

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:31.640
Very importantly,

00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:33.700
don't forget toe at the center.

00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:36.660
Whatever the value of this thesis class,

00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:38.600
I want toe apply over here.

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:45.530
So I'm gonna say you're classical Is 2% s like this The first person ages must be

00:19:45.530 --> 00:19:48.100
substituted with the CSS class.

00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:49.070
I'll give this.

00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:50.400
Save it on.

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:52.540
Let's go back to our browser.

00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:54.090
Refresh this on.

00:19:54.090 --> 00:20:00.950
Now we can see the CSS plus is applied on my table so we can completely customize the user

00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:07.990
defined the tags which gives us tremendous power in terms off what we can do in a jsp In

00:20:07.990 --> 00:20:14.440
the earlier days of jsp a framework or a party struck's introduced lot off custom tax on

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:15.350
they became very,

00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:16.210
very popular.

00:20:16.210 --> 00:20:22.130
And eventually Jolla Community Process adopted some of those tax in tow the JSP standards

00:20:22.130 --> 00:20:25.370
and they all called us jsp standard tag liberty.

00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:29.440
So literally using Jay's placed under tag Ligeti or Js steel,

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:34.010
we can aware the writing off Java completely.

00:20:34.010 --> 00:20:35.820
If you look at this Jsp here.

00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:39.760
We haven't written a single line of job over here,

00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:44.700
but we still are executive A lot of gel accord in the form off tax.

00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:46.140
In the subsequent lectures,

00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:51.060
we will have a look in tow Js steel on how to use the same thing in our application.
