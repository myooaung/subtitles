00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.110
in this lecture,

00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:07.540
let's write a controller that responds toe a button click here and displays the details

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:12.420
once again toe Ask the confirmation from the user toe permanently Delete the record.

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.760
And if the user confirms deletion by typing what of the text asked,

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.480
then it is supposed to permanently delete and then redirect the user back to probably the

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:23.150
homepage.

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:24.770
So let's go to the J Speaker.

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:26.980
Responding to this view contact details,

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.140
which is the show contact JSP.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.430
This is where I'm displaying the details and there is a A head trip that looks like a

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:35.040
button here.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.050
Any details on the same thing that I'm going to do once more.

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:44.250
So this time I'm going to say a true F equals toe don't slash delete contact,

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.620
but I need to supply the idea of the contacts to be deleted.

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.480
So I'm gonna say dollar contact our i d.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:56.670
We'll also give a class off Bt and Bt in outline danger.

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.250
And then the captain has believed this.

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:05.370
Let's go back to the browser and refresh this and see how this is gonna look like so you

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.070
can see that there is a delete this it looks like an outline.

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.290
But when I move the cursor under reconsiders,

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.050
delete this.

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.060
So now when I click on that,

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.720
it's going to come back with a fortnight for because we don't have any separate

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:17.760
corresponding to this.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.350
So let's adjust that controller partner.

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.820
Let's go back to our eclipse in the package.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.090
Let's create a sunlit that says Delete contacts.

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.550
Omelet,

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.420
Right Click New class.

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.590
The name of the class is gonna be delete Contact.

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.850
Separate Super class Going to be http Summit.

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.390
Let's click Finish ID An addition Here.

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:42.620
I did it.

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:48.590
VEB sublet on the Ural pattern is nothing but delete dash contact.

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.790
That is the one that I just know used in the hyperlink Over here.

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:56.970
Delete contact that must have a do get to process this perimeter.

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:58.950
It's going at a do get.

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:06.590
Let's also import the web sublet from the Saturday p a at the default cereal ocean you I d

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.650
get it off this comment.

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:15.400
And now let's add the do get toe handle that request on in the quite a stink perimeter were

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.580
receiving ideas.

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:23.940
So we're gonna say string input equals toe request our get perimeter off idee and in

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.930
creative input equals toe.

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.880
Know that means you're tryingto invoke this already without supplying aioli directly on

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:31.070
that.

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.540
Just one.

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.740
We simply want to return the user back to some location.

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.950
And then obviously the preferred location is the home pitch.

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.330
And if the user has logged in,

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:41.560
it will go to the dashboard.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.050
If the user has not loved him,

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.850
it has to go to the log in page.

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:50.750
Let's say your response dot Send a redirect toe dot slash on.

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:51.880
Then we say bitter.

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.750
We also want to ensure that this is being authenticated.

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:02.400
So I'm gonna copy this and then go to the log in check filter and add in the list off

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.240
existing subjects over here.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.750
So I'm gonna put a comma and then paste this.

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.570
So let's come back to over summit.

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:13.420
So if input is now,

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.680
then you're going to be redirected to the homepage.

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.540
But if the user has entered something in the form off idee,

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:27.670
then you're gonna convert that into an indigent integer I d equals toe new individual off

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:28.250
input.

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.460
If this fails because of the number for my exception,

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:36.830
the user will be taken back to the default error page which were comfortable,

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:37.130
you know,

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.940
Abdullah XML,

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.190
But assuming that the user has entered the I d properly,

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:48.130
it is a number are user would have clicked on the button now many toe to the details for

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:52.600
this ivy and then ask for the confirmation from the user.

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.160
So we're gonna go and get the lobby news already.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.150
I can say her user user requests toe user,

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:01.060
this is the casting.

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.630
And then say request or get session.

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.070
Don't get attribute off,

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:06.700
user.

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.450
That's import user from our indeed a package.

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.650
And now I need to say surveys don't get contact,

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.800
which takes these two s perimeter.

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.430
So to use the service,

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:26.310
I need to create its every subject New contact service Don't get contact by idee That takes

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.830
the idea.

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:31.680
And the user i d on this use already comes from a user dot get i d.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.200
The written really of dysfunction is a contact object soul.

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.960
It's ascended toe variable call See one press command one toe ultra gender,

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.050
the variable type.

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:42.870
We're simply going to store this,

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.360
see one in the request cope like set,

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:51.700
attribute and then call it a C or contact and then see what is available and we simply

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:56.170
forward this toe a jsp called Confirm Volition Dart,

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:58.440
ESPN or Confirmed Village or GSP,

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.730
so we'll tell your request.

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:08.490
Art Get request dispatcher slash Web enough slash views slash that they conform,

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:14.770
delete contact dark GSP and then say forward request response.

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:16.430
And in this jsp,

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.770
we're gonna check if C one is no.

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:20.460
Then we will spend our message.

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:20.980
If,

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:21.120
say,

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.390
one is not a questionable,

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:25.440
then we will display a few details off the contact.

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.230
Then ask the user toe.

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:32.580
Confirm delish in by allowing the user to type in some text like permanently delete or

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:33.350
something like that.

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:36.680
When the user clicks on that confirm button,

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.130
that's going to be a submit button,

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:40.010
and that's going to come to a new post.

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:40.710
So let's added,

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:43.880
Do post here and in the do post.

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:49.710
I'm supposed to return to perimeters from the request object number one would be the idea

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:51.250
of the contact to be deleted.

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:56.770
The second is the phrase permanently deleted whether the user has entered correctly or not

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:56.770
,

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:02.400
and if the user hasn't to type the correctly so then we are going toe rear end up this jsp

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.840
But if the user has entered correctly,

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:07.950
that means you have supposed toe proceed towards deletion.

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:11.430
So let's handle the same in the do post to now.

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:18.450
Let's come back over here and then say integer I d equals toe new integer off.

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:21.830
Request our get perimeter off I d.

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:27.830
That's the 1st 1 As a last 2nd 1 we're gonna say string conform equals toe.

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:30.630
Request our get perimeter off.

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:32.880
Confirm that's the textbooks.

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:36.460
Were user would have entered whatever was asked to enter.

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:38.980
So in order for us to delete the contact,

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:40.720
we also need the logged in user.

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:45.280
So we're gonna copy this part and then based over here.

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:45.800
Now,

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:52.000
let's check if the user has type the text permanently delete properly or not by using any

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:52.530
condition.

00:06:52.530 --> 00:07:00.800
I can say if conform dot equals on the Texas permanently deal it.

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:05.870
That the text that we're expecting the user to type if that's equals toe falls.

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:08.750
That means user has not confirmed.

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:11.160
We don't want to proceed to the dilation.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:15.070
So we're going to store the contact object in the request.

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:17.730
Copan present the same jsp once again.

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:23.940
So that request the three lines I'm gonna copy this and then based over here.

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:28.020
But if the user has time to the text correctly,

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:31.260
then we're gonna come back and say else And this is where we need toe.

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.820
Proceed towards delish in off the record.

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:34.940
And here also,

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:36.640
we need a contact with object.

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:41.820
So instead of creating the contractor with object twice so we can assign this to a variable

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:42.930
called service,

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:48.580
I'm gonna cut this from your type Something called Service On That This is gonna be studies

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:53.650
equals toe new contact Surveys since always has not been declared.

00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:58.650
So it's giving another command one and then enter or control one on windows.

00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:00.060
Create the local very well.

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:00.770
This is fine.

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:03.440
Now that those are variable is here,

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:08.140
I can reuse the same thing even in the else block on all have to do is to say,

00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:14.050
service dot billet contact by idly on the perimeters are idee use already,

00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:17.050
which is nothing about user dot get i d.

00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:19.650
We don't have errors right now,

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:23.040
so let's declare in adults object by person,

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:26.270
command one and then pressed Enter It creates a map object,

00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:28.240
but it's not been initialized,

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:32.850
so it's asking me to initialize If I again this command one and enter it will initialize

00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:33.990
that with null off course.

00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:34.800
I don't want no lie.

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:36.170
Need new Hashmat.

00:08:36.170 --> 00:08:38.570
So that's first control space.

00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:40.620
Import the same thing from job order.

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:42.920
Do till at the end of this deal.

00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:45.660
It operation there are two old comes number one.

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:50.350
Either there is an editor's because of which the deal it didn't take place or there is no

00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:51.410
other the deal.

00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:52.460
It was successful.

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:54.150
So if the deal it was successful,

00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:56.650
we are only going to redirect the user back toe.

00:08:56.650 --> 00:08:59.590
Probably the home page of the list of contacts.

00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:05.130
But if the others we want toe really under this jsp once again saying that Hey,

00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:06.960
there was some adults.

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:09.950
So the way we do is we come here and then type.

00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:16.460
If editors dot size is equals to zero,

00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:19.460
then we're going to say response.

00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:21.080
Don't send a redirect.

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:22.670
So we are doing a client,

00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:23.730
said redirection.

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:25.680
Because the deletion has been successful.

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:27.810
We want to go to the homepage,

00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:29.490
probably after deletion,

00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:36.300
but otherwise we may have to go back toe the same jsp to say that there was another and

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:37.850
just before proceeding for there.

00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:42.060
We're gonna store that others collection in the request cope so we can display that error

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:42.650
message.

00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:47.890
So I'm gonna copy this line and paste or here.

00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:49.380
But before that,

00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:52.130
I'm also going to say request art said attribute.

00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:57.700
We're gonna store editors as the key on errors is the object that we want to store.

00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:01.360
And hopefully our controller is now ready.

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:04.390
We have addressed all formulation combinations here.

00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:07.450
The only remaining aspect is the view.

00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:10.240
Bad people are just in the next lecture.

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:12.410
So that's all for this lecture.

00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:13.590
See you in the next one.
