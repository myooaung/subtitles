00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.910
in this lecture.

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:05.810
Let's set up our dear earlier for the project to start with.

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:10.960
Let's create entity classes representing these two tables as well as the mapper interfaces

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:12.470
for my batteries.

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:19.050
Will also set up a deal factory class that can give me an instance off a mapper interface.

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.670
To do that first,

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.200
let's go door palm the maximal,

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.260
which is right here on a few dependence is before we proceed.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:32.040
So let's create a dependencies tag on inside that I have to copy paste few of the

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.830
dependencies.

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:35.740
Let's go to the envy and deposited dot com.

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:43.360
They make clothes other times over here and open a new tab Goto Emmy and Deposited Outcome

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.360
,

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.720
which is the main one.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.970
Central number one is the hitch to libraries.

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:49.270
Press enter.

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.190
Go to the head student of its engine.

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:59.150
Make sure to select the 141 97 Copy that Come back over here based it.

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:03.550
Make sure toe remove the scope are get a scope as provided.

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:10.000
The 2nd 1 is Lombok because we want toe the get a sitter's automatically soil.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.280
Type your long book.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.730
Get the 1st 1 latest Washington Copy the dependency.

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:19.200
Come back on then paste over here.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.010
The next one is gonna be my back.

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:28.230
This let's go and search the same thing my baptise get the are not my buddies Readout

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:33.650
fighter for that's the washing were using Copy that and then come back over here and taste

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:33.870
it.

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:36.380
Since we're gonna work with Js steel,

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.480
we also required the J Steel and standards.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.370
So I'm gonna take your Js steel.

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.360
We thought that the 1st 1 doesn't have the job,

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.730
so we need to sell it this one.

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:46.880
So I'm gonna select this.

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.450
Get the latest Russian in that list.

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:56.520
Copy that and then based over here on one lost is the standard which is the implementation

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.560
for this GST l a p a.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.690
So I'm gonna look for that and then say your standard select the 1st 1 Apache standard tag

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.370
lib on then Wonder toe That five.

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:08.850
Copy the dependency.

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.130
Come back over here and then paste it.

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.920
Let's formatted by person command shift f and then save it on all the dependencies would be

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.470
no alittle project.

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.850
You can go and have a look at that inside the Java resources libraries.

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.690
Maybe independence is You can see that we have all the jobs.

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.880
So during the deployment time,

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:35.130
all these will be added toe our web and have lived directly automatically.

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.340
If you wanna have a look at how it works,

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.650
so you can go to the project and then go to the properties off the same.

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.230
You should see that there is a section here called Deployment Assembly.

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:46.680
That's the assembly,

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.220
which is nothing with the war file on the content of the war,

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:52.620
four will be shown over here,

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.570
and you can see that the mainland dependencies would be added Toe viburnum slash lib.

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.100
So all your job profiles will be compiled and kept in the Web.

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:02.210
Enough classes folder.

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:04.650
So if you have any XML our properties files,

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.480
they also would be kept under the weather.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.380
Enough classes folder.

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.990
So we're gonna have one properties filed for our my back is,

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.310
and that's going to go into the ban of classes.

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.750
And,

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:14.120
of course,

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.510
the HTML files will go into the root off your applications.

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:20.650
Let's cancel this out.

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.220
Let's create a new class representing our users,

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.790
and it's supposed to have five fields representing five columns over here.

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.590
Let's right click on a salty Main Java new class.

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.060
The class names are going to be a singular,

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.110
So I'm gonna take your user.

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:42.300
But the package name is not gonna be a phone book.

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:43.410
It's gonna be a cord out,

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.860
we know dot Then you can say phone book If you want on,

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.070
then you say entity,

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:48.720
let's click.

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:54.950
Finish private individual idee Private string name,

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:05.080
Private string email on DA private String crossword on one last private date created at a

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.950
notice that I've used created at using camel cats.

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:09.390
But as in the DB script,

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:10.820
it is an underscore.

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.580
Now I could go and use your underscored,

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:18.080
but I mentioned that I'm gonna follow the best practices underscores our against the best

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.870
practices.

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.640
But this will cause a problem when we're working with my bed is because my body's trays toe

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.370
map the field names two column names,

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.700
but we have about current for the same.

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:29.830
Let's follow that.

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:32.730
Instead of deviating from the best practice now,

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:35.720
the date needs to be imported from Java Util.

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.580
You see that you tell as a lot of skill,

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:43.500
but we're gonna pick up from the util on Let's had the default constructor at the rate no

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:50.150
are constructor and then at the rate getter and one last at the rate setter.

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:51.370
Save it.

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:52.040
That's great.

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.850
Another class representing the contact.

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:59.400
So we're gonna have one contact object representing a record off this.

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.910
So let's go and clear a new class here under Entity New Class.

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:10.870
Let's call us contact against singular Click Finish and let's arrange them so that we can

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:11.830
see them together.

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:16.320
So let's have your private integer.

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:20.110
I'd be private string first name,

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:21.790
Private string,

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:22.490
Last name.

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:25.090
We have email and phone,

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:29.600
which are again off string type I.

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.490
Really most of them are off string type.

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:32.190
In this case,

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:34.650
outer.

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:37.100
This is gonna be a link to an avatar.

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:42.980
So there is a website called gravity R D for many of the website to use gravity as the

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:44.940
water for the users.

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:49.470
So we can also try fatigued from ground based on the email included.

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:51.980
The user didn't mention then we have few more,

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:53.650
which are on I dress related.

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:54.500
So I have here.

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:57.370
I'm just city,

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:59.950
state,

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:03.850
country on day in court.

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:09.750
The sequence doesn't matter related to their table columns and the field names here,

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:11.690
so you can have it in different sequences.

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:18.140
And unless is the private date created at just like the previous ones.

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:26.240
And the date needs to be imported from Java util Say finish that also are the annotations

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:27.040
grated toe.

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:28.780
No argument constructors get us.

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:31.000
It is I can get that from user starch.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:31.520
Our here.

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:33.500
So I can copy these three on,

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:34.830
then paste over here.

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:37.190
And that should actually import also.

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:44.700
So our entity classes are really now let's create a map interface for both of them.

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:50.360
So I'm gonna create a map interface called Contact Deol on User Dio.

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:58.200
Let's close this Go back toe the explorer and then right click this package new interface

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:00.780
But the interface is not part of the entity.

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:02.520
It's going to be a part of their deal.

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:04.780
So it's going to clear the new package called dear.

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:04.980
Well,

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:05.670
that's holidays,

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:07.150
user deal,

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:08.580
click finish.

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:11.330
We don't write any content over here,

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:15.790
but as and when we progress in our application will come and are the required

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:16.750
functionalities.

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:17.710
Similarly,

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:23.430
a minaret like the deal package and say new interferes on this and the interface is gonna

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:24.780
be called contacted.

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:25.410
Deveaux.

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:29.790
So all the current operations and quite is related to the context table will be giving it

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:30.420
over here.

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:32.960
On one last is the deal factory,

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:38.040
which is gonna be a class which involves creating objects off contact Jiro or User.

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:44.730
The was a moderate click on this and then say new class that is going to be called deal

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:45.560
sanctity,

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:48.780
which is going to be a final plus,

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:53.850
Let's click finish that also add a default constructor by pressing control space.

00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:59.920
But changing this public toe private so you don't have a way of creating an object off this

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:00.530
anymore.

00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:03.460
But instead we're gonna have your static functions.

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:08.080
So we're gonna have your public static user Dio That's the written type.

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:09.730
Get user deal.

00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:12.810
There's a function supposed to return something for the time being.

00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:15.720
I'm gonna say it on now on like this.

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:23.910
I also want to have a function called public static contact view Get contact deal and

00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:25.970
return now for the time being again.

00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:27.840
And this is where we need toe,

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:31.930
use my batters and then return a deal object.

00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:32.830
So far,

00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:37.540
this require the XML file representing my bestest configuration.

00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:39.770
We use this in the previous project,

00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:41.890
so let me collapsed on the project.

00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:49.650
Fights expand the previous product with a solid demo under job resources A salty main

00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:51.910
resources You can see we have this My bet.

00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:53.190
This conflict XML,

00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:54.990
I'm gonna right click copy.

00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:57.940
Go back to the phone book project.

00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:03.890
Go to Jolla Resources Jolla Main Resources Right click and then say based.

00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:04.850
So now you see,

00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:06.980
in our project we have this photographs Fine.

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:08.940
My bed is config xml.

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:10.390
And also,

00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:15.170
if you go back to the previous project on then say itself seem Inshallah,

00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:19.500
there's a deal package on there is a deal of factory And if you look at that,

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:21.350
the court is very simple.

00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:24.720
It's supposed to load the my brother's conflict similar as an input stream.

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:28.500
Clear the SQL session factor and then clear the SQL session.

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:30.730
These three lines are gonna be common.

00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:34.050
Some of the copy this and then come back to my court over here.

00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:37.860
I faced it and then using the session object,

00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:39.020
I can now say Hey,

00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:45.700
I want a mapper object for user deals until your session don't get mapper and then say your

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:47.870
user Delwar dot class.

00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:48.650
Of course,

00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:50.610
this throws a checked exception.

00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:52.670
We can just throw it away from this function.

00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:57.480
So let me move the carcel on this and then say add throws declaration.

00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:58.400
I'm no.

00:09:58.400 --> 00:09:59.360
Come here,

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:06.350
face the same three lines of court and then say written session dot Get mapper and then say

00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:09.090
contact deal dot class.

00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:13.410
Through this exception from the get contact deal function,

00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:17.810
you can see that we're duplicating these three lanes of court in multiple functions.

00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:18.740
And if you don't want,

00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:24.590
you can simply select this so you can go toe re factor extract matter on what it does.

00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:30.660
It is going toe cut this three lines off court into a function and not that it smartly

00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:36.000
detects the return value because the variable session here is being used years.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.300
Obviously it cannot become a local variable of that,

00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:39.870
so it has to return something.

00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:41.260
So it is smartly.

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:42.650
I didn't defend the return value of this,

00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:44.800
and it says extracted is the name of the function.

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:48.380
So we can say probably create session or get session,

00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:51.370
whatever the name you want to call it us and then take on okay,

00:10:51.370 --> 00:10:56.140
and you can see that there is a new function created over here and that function is being

00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:57.030
just used.

00:10:57.030 --> 00:11:00.900
I know is one more smart thing that eclipse has done in the clips identified that the same

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:04.840
three lanes of court existed in other function and then added that right here.

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:08.390
So let me arrange them like this.

00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:14.010
So we have a private function and then we have to get usually will get contact your

00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:16.020
functions on one more good practice.

00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:21.470
If you want to follow the only purpose of this local variable east toe call a function over

00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:21.810
here.

00:11:21.810 --> 00:11:24.190
So this is also considered at the back practice.

00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:29.160
What we can do is we can actually copy this or cut this from here on,

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:33.680
then use that statement like this so that we have a one liner over here.

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:34.180
So it says,

00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:36.460
create session dot Get mapper.

00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:37.680
Don't get you the Rio.

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:38.280
So the same thing.

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:39.680
I'm gonna do it for this also.

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:41.050
Let's get off this line.

00:11:41.050 --> 00:11:42.120
And now you see,

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:44.220
our functions are very,

00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:44.920
very simple.

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:46.400
So with this now,

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:52.240
our dear will air is pretty much really except that the user deal on contact there will.

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:54.360
They don't have any mapper functions.

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:57.400
We will add those functions as we move forward,

00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:57.670
you know,

00:11:57.670 --> 00:11:58.350
project.

00:11:58.350 --> 00:11:59.980
So that's all for this.

00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:01.650
Like you're seeing the next one
