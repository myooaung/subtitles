00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.220
in this lecture.

00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:05.950
Let's implement dysfunction at new user off the contacts of this class.

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:07.180
But before that,

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:13.450
I forgot toe add the user I d off the currently logged in user to this contact object.

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:15.020
So from the session,

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:17.760
we can retrieve the user object on the user.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:18.640
Object has an I.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:18.930
D.

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.700
And we have to set that as the seed are set.

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.490
Use ready to do that?

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.250
Let's first say user,

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.800
user,

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.640
because toe request our get session.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.750
Don't get attribute called user.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:33.310
Now,

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:38.280
this is not going to give any editor because we're already checked whether the user has

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.350
logged in or not using the filter,

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.190
which means that this is going to return a valid object that we're gonna cast in tow,

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:46.050
user type.

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:46.930
And of course,

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.910
I have to import user from our entity package.

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:50.070
Still,

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.160
it's too the same thing,

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:57.460
and now we have to set this user I d toe the contact objects user I d on.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.660
Let's go to the contact touch Ella.

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.420
You can see that I don't have a feel that representing use already.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.620
Let's go and type your private integer or int user I d.

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.410
If you check the Devi Scripter rescue.

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:16.400
We have a column corresponding to the same thing here called User Underscore I d.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.210
So now that there is a settled for this because of the annotation here.

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.640
So if I come back to my contacts are lit and then type here,

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.380
seed are set use already user dot get I D.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.400
So this is how we are associating the foreign key off the user stable.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.820
Now let's go to the context of race class on implement dysfunction.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:40.370
Now here,

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:43.870
I want toe take her off basic validations for name,

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:45.250
email and phone number.

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:46.590
Apart from that,

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.580
we also had to check whether there is already a contact available with the given email or

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:52.370
with the phone.

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:55.140
And if the answer to these questions is yes,

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.470
then we can simply return the control back to the sunlight and salad will take it off,

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.520
displaying the error messages back to the user.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:07.030
Other ways we proceed toe are this contact object that the new record in the database table

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.580
for that we have to make it to the contact to deal.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:11.560
So first,

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.290
let's take care of the validations for force name email on a phone number.

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.020
For the sake of simplicity,

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.180
let's assign the first name from the contact objective.

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.680
Variable,

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:29.460
called F name equals to see that get first name dot trim Andi declared the variable F name

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:30.480
off type string.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:37.750
Now I can check your if F name dot land equals 20 that means you haven't entered any value

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:38.180
at all.

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.900
Are you might have entered few spaces.

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.800
Then I'm supposed to say edit start.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.150
Put on the key is first name,

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.990
and that's what actually displayed over here in the contact form door.

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.440
Jsp.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.780
You can see that we about your error start for spin,

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.850
and that's the reason this key is important.

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:57.910
And the value for that is that there,

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:58.750
for example,

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.450
first name is required.

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:08.350
You can also check else if F name dot lent is less than three letters,

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:12.950
then I can give another at a message and I'll start put.

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:14.840
The key is the same thing.

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.180
First name on the value is let's,

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.980
for example,

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.750
at least three letters required for first name.

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.700
Similarly,

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:31.850
I can check if email is entered or not for the domino copied this on paste,

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:36.580
and this is supposed to be cedar get email dot lent.

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:37.240
Of course,

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.050
you can also check Dr Trim dot Lent.

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:41.920
If it's equal to zero,

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.750
then I can say email address is required as the other message.

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.200
The phone number Exactly the same thing.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.200
I'm gonna copy and paste this over here,

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.070
so see that Get phone.

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:54.910
Dr M.

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:57.190
Dorland equals zero field,

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.430
for which the other is required his phone on.

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.690
Then I can say phone number is required.

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:03.700
Of course,

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.500
if you feel that the phone number and email or not mandatory,

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.450
you can just remove these two allegations.

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:10.370
But if you're adding a new contract,

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:12.300
it's worth having the phone number and email.

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.720
Otherwise,

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.450
you would not be able to contact them anyways.

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:19.630
Apart from this now I have to check if there is already a record for this.

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:23.260
Email are already a record for this particular phone number,

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.840
but that requests us to connect to the database and get the details.

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.260
But if any of these areas are already there,

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.360
we will simply send the letters back to the controller,

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.890
and if there are no errors here,

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:37.860
then we will check that with the database.

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.200
So to do that,

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:44.940
let's go and check your If errors dot size is greater than zero,

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.070
then we'll say written now.

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:51.740
But other ways I'm coming here and then talking to the bit of is to talk to the database.

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.470
I need a deer war so we can see your contact to deal.

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:58.770
Deal equals toe be Able factory.

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.970
Don't get contact deal,

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:03.160
which throws an IRA exception.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:08.500
Let's throw it away from this function by pressing Command one or controlled one and then

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.880
press enter and he would see that it says,

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.010
Are you exception?

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:15.940
Since this is being called from the do post function off a sublet,

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:19.750
which already has this throw signature in the do post function.

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:21.240
So there is no problem.

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.930
Let's come here and call a function which doesn't exist,

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:26.170
as I know in the deal,

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:29.780
but which is supposed to return a contact object for a given email?

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:31.550
Let's call it US contract.

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:33.510
C one equals toe deal.

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:40.540
Don't get contact by email on will supply this seed or get email as the perimeter,

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:42.110
and this function doesn't exist.

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:43.110
That's why we're getting another,

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:44.460
and it's very simple right now.

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:49.620
You can press command one or controlled one on ask a clips to create dysfunction.

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:50.220
Remember,

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:51.360
we're doing the top.

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:52.400
Don't approach here,

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.270
so press command one or controlled one press enter on.

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:58.330
You can see that in the contact.

00:05:58.330 --> 00:05:58.920
The oh no,

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:04.720
We have one quality function called Get contact by email on its singular because there's

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:08.550
only one contact for a given email or zero contact.

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:11.940
Let's come back to our contact salaries.

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:13.650
You can see that the others have gone.

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:17.130
So if I see one knot equals to know,

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:23.600
that means you already have a contact with this email so I can just give a message for this

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:24.480
particular field.

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:28.310
Let's say your errors don't put the Phillies email,

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:35.110
but the message is there is already a contact for this email.

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:38.040
But if someone is equal sternal,

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:39.790
that means there is no problem.

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:42.630
This is considered as a new contract object,

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:46.270
but we also have to do the similar check for phone numbers.

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:51.390
I'm gonna copy this line from here to here based on,

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:52.630
then changes toe,

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:58.700
get contact by phone and see dot get phone as perimeter again.

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:00.110
There is no such function this time.

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:02.210
Eclipse gives me couple off options.

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:02.770
One it says,

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:02.960
Hey,

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:04.220
you might have made a mistake.

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:06.950
Changes to get contact by email.

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:08.410
All you can say clearly,

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:10.370
method called Get contact by phone.

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:11.270
That's what we want.

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:14.970
So I selected option and we got another function here.

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:15.670
Contact.

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:17.510
Get contact by phone.

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:18.280
Which drink?

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:19.380
Phone as a perimeter.

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:20.340
Let's say this.

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:21.990
Comeback toe contacts Terrorist.

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:24.480
Assuming that dysfunction is going toe,

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:25.690
return an object.

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:28.500
If this phone number is already existing again,

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:29.620
the same thing we have to do.

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:34.100
If C one nautical sternal you'll send an adamis is related to the phone.

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:37.220
We can say there is already a contact for this phone.

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:43.050
I'm gonna copy that and paste here and changes to phone because that's the field for which

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:48.270
you want to display The A message and the aroma cities they already a contact for this

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:49.080
phone number.

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:56.500
So we're copy this on pace here because if there are others for these two,

00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:58.120
we will send it back.

00:07:58.120 --> 00:07:59.570
But if there are no errors,

00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:04.660
we simply have to call a function on the deal that can take our contact object and saving

00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:06.050
to their delivers as a new record.

00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:11.450
So let's call a non existing function deal dot create contact.

00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:12.550
And then let's apply.

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:16.050
The C C is the input perimeter that we have received,

00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:21.510
which now is rally according to all these conditions on dysfunction doesn't exist or

00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:23.610
eclipses complaining about the same.

00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:29.750
Let's move the cursor on the mirror and say Clear and method called Create contact.

00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:35.340
Let's select that it's a public boiled create contact function takes contact object of the

00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:36.030
perimeter.

00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:39.350
Let's save this and come back toe contacts always.

00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:41.220
And if everything is okay,

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:45.110
let's return the same see as the return value.

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:45.820
From here.

00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:52.240
Let's say this Andi test a cliff for the valuations will not be ableto tested this section

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:56.190
because this requires communication to the database on None off.

00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:58.170
All functions have skilled mapping,

00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:00.410
but at least we can check a first name.

00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:03.530
Mandatory First name Lent email is mandatory.

00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:04.490
Phone is vanity.

00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:06.460
Whether those relations work or not,

00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:07.830
let's right.

00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:12.180
Click our phone book project and then say Run as around.

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:12.530
Answer.

00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:12.820
Well,

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:17.670
if I tried to directly access at the contact,

00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:19.530
it's going to take me to the log in page.

00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:21.010
That's what we expected.

00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:23.340
Let's type here the valid email.

00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:25.540
We know that we know Darko password,

00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:27.520
secret clique logging.

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:29.100
Now I have a menu.

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:30.270
Here are contact.

00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:31.910
Let's click on this on.

00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:36.720
Let's click State Little Street of it and I should get a limited for first name,

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:37.920
email and phone number.

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:38.720
You continue.

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:39.800
This first name is required.

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:41.030
Similarly,

00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:42.260
if I type,

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.660
you'll say s maybe a data for email.

00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:45.970
Let's say,

00:09:45.970 --> 00:09:46.880
for example,

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:51.590
John Doe at example dot com taken save details.

00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:54.370
You can see that the other message will be a little bit different.

00:09:54.370 --> 00:09:57.470
It is at least three letters required for the first name.

00:09:57.470 --> 00:09:58.300
However,

00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:01.290
I lost what I tied here and then email wants proper,

00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:03.050
but even I lost that also.

00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:05.350
Now this can be addressed easily,

00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:07.940
using the summer and JSP combination here.

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:09.750
So in the our contacts are rich.

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:13.590
We have all the details in the form of contact object over here.

00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:14.750
And if there is another,

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:18.460
we're going to the contract funder J speak carrying only the others.

00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:24.100
But we can also store this contact object in the request opened and go there on in the

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:24.990
contact form.

00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:28.720
We can make use of the same contact object and displayed it as values.

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:29.570
For example,

00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:32.130
let's add request art set attribute.

00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:38.610
Let's call it us see or contact and then sees the variable I want to store and in the

00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:40.350
contact form their GSP,

00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:44.100
which is right here for each of the text boxes.

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:53.180
I also have to say here value equals toe dollar contact dot first name and then copy the

00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:58.220
same thing for each one off them and then paste make the necessary changes,

00:10:58.220 --> 00:10:58.860
for example.

00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:00.450
And copy this and based here.

00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:02.230
But this is gonna be lost.

00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:02.470
Me,

00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:07.150
I'm gonna pause the video and then do the same thing and then come back.

00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:12.180
So I've done the same thing for all of them on Let's give it a try.

00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:12.410
No,

00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:15.750
that's a all the files restart Tomcat,

00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:22.810
Go back to the form on Let's click the Save leaders once on.

00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:24.470
And of course,

00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:26.310
because the hunger got restarted.

00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:31.640
So decision was invalidated automatically and I've been taken to the log inform Let's log

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:38.060
in first we know that we know Darko secret lugging our contact.

00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:45.300
Let's say the first mammals sham on then last moment sindoor email s litigation at example

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:51.980
dot com but I'm not going to get the phone number and probably city and Spangler state US.

00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:59.460
Let a Karnataka country as India If I click on save details and because there is a missing

00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:01.920
phone number I didn't I should get the other message on.

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:03.520
All these values should be preserved.

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:05.980
Let's click those same details and see what happens.

00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:09.220
I don't see the values again here.

00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:09.730
If I wreck,

00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:11.890
click and then say View paid source.

00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:16.050
You can see that that all values are blanks.

00:12:16.050 --> 00:12:17.370
Believe it should be.

00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:20.920
Probably because off an assignment here,

00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:21.860
So we're assigning.

00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:22.800
See is equals.

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:26.020
Toe salaries are our new user on duh.

00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:29.550
I'm new User is returning a knowledge because of violation error.

00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:31.790
So let's get off this assignment.

00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:34.120
So now C is intact.

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:35.240
It's the same object.

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:36.590
Not they should work.

00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:38.100
So let's say or separate.

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:38.890
Restart,

00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:43.940
dunk it and probably refresh.

00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:46.350
Let's see if I've Bean logged off.

00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:47.230
Yes,

00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:48.370
that's logging again.

00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:49.230
We know that.

00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:53.250
We know dot co secret that click the log in button.

00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:54.800
I'm contact.

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:57.300
Let's give a name here,

00:12:57.300 --> 00:12:57.880
Sean,

00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:04.450
Soon there as the last name email address litigation at example dot com.

00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:05.060
Ah,

00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:05.640
phone number.

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:09.690
I want to deliberately leave it blank because I want to see if these are preserved.

00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:13.990
If violation of rockers on Let's Give the country as India on,

00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:15.540
then click on Save details.

00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:16.390
On this time,

00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:21.100
you can see the other message comes over here on the remaining ones are result.

00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:26.250
Even if I type your that's a bungalow and then save Britain's and you can see still,

00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:27.070
I get the same thing.

00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:29.200
If I remove the email and then click on this,

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:31.560
the Aramis it for email also comes,

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:33.500
but the rest of them are preserved.

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:36.160
And if you just check the page source by right,

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:38.200
click here and then save you pacers,

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:44.060
you'll see that the value comes because off our expression that were given here.

00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:46.370
So value equals toe contact.

00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:46.810
Email.

00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:47.690
Contact first name,

00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:48.440
etcetera.

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:55.780
So the only thing that is now missing is if I send all valued details and click on save

00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:56.270
details.

00:13:56.270 --> 00:13:59.800
It should be added to the database table as a new record,

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:05.780
which currently is not implemented because our contact there will is incomplete in the next

00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:07.940
little let's complete this task
