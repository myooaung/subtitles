X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=LOCAL:00:00:00.000,MPEGTS:0

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.650
in the next few lectures.

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:07.580
Let's provide a feature where a user can edit the details of the contract for that.

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:09.850
Let's throw it a button in this particular pitch.

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:12.300
This output is coming from the show.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.810
Contact our JSP.

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:17.040
So this is the one where I'm displaying the details.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:22.350
Let's wrote a button after the stable slash table so that when I click on that,

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.660
the details here should be loaded onto the same.

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:26.110
HTM.

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:28.350
Inform that we use for our contact.

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:30.550
So we want toe reuse this future.

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:31.810
To do that.

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:34.940
Let's go for us at a button right below this table.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.240
Let's provide a hyperlink.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.020
Hatred equals toe.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.850
Don't slash it it and update contact.

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.680
It's also give a class that makes this hyperlink look like important.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.420
So we said Bt and Bt and primary.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.780
The caption off that is going to be,

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:51.850
Let's say it.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:52.750
Details.

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.020
Save this.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.840
If I come back to the browser and go to the previous page here,

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:59.920
refresh.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.580
I should see there is a any details,

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:07.680
but now clicking on which will only take me to the former for because I don't have the

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.030
corresponding summit,

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.310
so I need to create a separate and map it toe this Yordan.

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.440
So let's create a summit called Edit Update.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:16.580
Contact Summit.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.780
Let's go to the package here.

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.850
Right click New class.

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.360
I'll call it as it it update.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.150
Contact Sublet As usual,

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.750
the super class is gonna be http Summit.

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.340
Let's click Finish.

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.500
I had a great web,

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:42.640
several an addition and then give the your apartment slash edit andi update contact at the

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:43.590
default cereal.

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.650
Washing your duty as a good practice.

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:51.350
Get it off these comments and then I bought Do get on the do post functions.

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.100
Now the Duga is the one that is supposed to render this particular form,

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.140
but preloaded with all the details of the contact.

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:04.290
But when I click on the same details that supposed to be a post request and that is going

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.930
to be handed by Do Post.

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:11.150
So let's begin by adding the do get so controlled space G or G E and then press enter.

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.970
Get it off these two lines on in this do get.

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:21.880
What we're supposed to do is to get the I D from the Quietest Inc perimeter and then get

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.320
the contact details off that store that in the request.

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.900
Go and then go to the contact form Dajae speak.

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.660
But the idea is supposed to come from the address bar here.

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:32.190
For example,

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.080
if I goto view all contacts,

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.530
view details when I click on this,

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.560
any details We are supposed to supply the idea of the person here as quite a stink

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:42.200
perimeter.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.830
So let's go for us to the show.

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.280
Contact JSP.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:53.490
We'll also put a question mark your and then say I d equals toe dollar contact dot Ivory

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:57.520
contact is the object using which you're displaying all the other leaders.

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:58.780
Let's save it.

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.540
Reload this And if I click on the daily details for the now,

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.030
you can see it says here,

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.110
edit and update contact ID equals to fall.

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.510
That idea convict you from the request object.

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:20.100
Using string input equals toe requested get perimeter and then type Heidi in gated.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.080
The user is manually trying to enter days on end.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.510
Idea is not supplied.

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:25.920
Input would be none.

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.330
So I can say if input equals toe know,

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:35.510
then probably I can treat at the user to either to the home page our toe the list off all

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:36.170
the contacts.

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:37.060
Let's redirect.

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.420
Do that.

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.650
The homepage response starts.

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:46.770
Send redirect toe dot slash that the homepage followed by return that's come down here if

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:47.650
input is there,

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.420
which means I d has been passed.

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.550
But it is possible that the user might have entered something like alphanumeric,

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:57.990
but that because a number of former exception when I'm trying to convert into an integer

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:01.170
but that is already handled by our web dot XML configuration.

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:02.490
So let's not worry about that.

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:03.550
We're going to simply say,

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:09.650
here integer ID equals toe new intelligence on then supply that input.

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:11.420
Now that we got the idea,

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.340
we can make us those service function.

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.550
So let's create a contact service object.

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:19.910
First surveys equals toe new contacts,

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:22.020
a risk the third dysfunction toe get.

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:26.600
The details of the contract requires the user radio of the person who is loving,

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.140
so we need to get the user object from the fission.

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.120
So let's copy that line from here.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.350
So this is the one that I've used copy and then come here and then paste.

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:40.230
And now I can say service dot get contact by I d.

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:41.160
Ideas.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:47.950
The input given by the user user ready is nothing but user dot get I d.

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:51.620
Let's assign this tree available called contact on,

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:56.740
then create the variable off type contact and now we have to store this contact in the

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:57.600
request scope.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.490
So let's do that by typing Request Are said attribute.

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:02.810
Contact is the key now.

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:07.250
This is important because this is the one that is used by our contact form.

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:10.750
So if I open the contact form dot jsp here,

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:15.040
you can see everywhere I'm saying Contact our first name contact.

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.730
Outlast him.

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:16.260
It's a trump,

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.380
so that is important.

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.850
The second perimeter is the object that you want to store,

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:21.550
which I named.

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:23.950
That's contact itself now.

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:27.980
One last step is to forward the request to the contact formed our JC,

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:29.930
So let's do that by taping request.

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:40.690
Don't get to request dispatcher slash Web in f slash views slash contact form dot gsp dot

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:44.900
forward Request on restaurants as parameters.

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:50.500
Let's say all the files restarts Tomcat and go to the browser.

00:05:50.500 --> 00:06:00.890
Let's log off and log a nice come on click on view all contacts like the view details for

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:07.710
gender and click on any details this now should bring with the same form that we used in

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:11.570
our contact already loading the details off Jane Doe.

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:14.430
So when I click on save details here,

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:18.810
this is going to be opposed to submission because if I go and view paid source,

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:22.470
you'll see that the HTML form has a maker off post,

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:27.190
so it will be submitted to the same mural it contact and update contact,

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:29.180
which is nothing but the subject that we just wrote.

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:33.090
But it will go to their do post function and in the do post function,

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:35.180
we should collect all these details.

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:38.550
Call a service function toe Abdic this contact,

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:41.150
which will then do some basic violations.

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:41.710
For example,

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:45.600
the first limit entered or entered with minimum number of characters.

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:46.710
Email is entered out,

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:50.220
not phone number is entered an art and that whole process,

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:52.810
let's follow the bottom up approach.

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:55.850
So we start from the deal function for the update,

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:57.080
then the service function.

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:59.090
Then we lead the do post function.

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:01.530
So to begin within the next lecture,

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:03.840
let's read the deal function for the scene,

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:06.010
and before we move on,

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:07.270
we also have toe.

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:11.190
Make sure that only authenticated users access this particular sunlight.

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:12.450
So I'm gonna copy this.

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:12.900
You are.

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:14.680
Go to the log in check.

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:18.480
Filter in the list off already existing neural patterns.

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:20.290
Let's also are this one.

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:21.390
Save this.

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:26.350
And now it contact details can be done only by logged in users.
