00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.070
in this lecture,

00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:03.760
let's discuss about war structure,

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:06.120
war stand for Web archive.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.920
Java community process.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:12.150
Standardize the way you deploy every application on toe a Web server.

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:18.100
Your combined all your project artifacts into a single zip file with an extension off dot

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.660
water and handed over to the Web server.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.210
The Web server takes the warfarin that you gave on,

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.270
then makes it really for production.

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:28.950
And this whole process is called US deployment.

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:35.170
While you can create the world file manually most of the times it is the responsibility off

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:36.580
the idea that you are using,

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:37.760
such as Eclipse,

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.600
which gives you an option toe simply.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.700
Rania Project on a website word on When you select corruption,

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.500
Eclipse automatically converts all your project files in tow.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.030
War file copies that in tow on appropriate folders off Apache.

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.040
Don't get in.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.480
It's exploded format.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.370
I want five Contest off a folder called Web I NF,

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:01.960
which is very important.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.720
The Web and a folder consists off a file called web dot XML,

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.150
which is also known as a deployment descriptor from solid Washington 0.0.5 onwards.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:18.240
Using a web dot XML has become optional and starting from several Washington 0.0.0.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.690
Many of the features off the web dot XML can be declared where annotations most common use

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:29.330
off the web dot XML is toe define sublets on their map ings.

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:30.070
Apart from that,

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.880
you can also have information about listeners.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.700
Filters session time out on fuel security constraints alongside Web Darek seven.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.110
There are typically two more folders over here.

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:43.700
One is called classes,

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.620
which consist off the class fails representing Sadler's filters,

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:49.490
listeners,

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:50.710
entity classes,

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:51.820
deer or classes.

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.450
Anything that you have quoted,

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.610
we'll be part off the classes folder.

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.400
The other one is the Lib folder.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.120
The lib,

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.120
as the name suggests,

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.940
is a library.

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:05.710
It consists off all the additional jars and sit wells that your project might be referring

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.960
to.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.250
If you're using XML files are properly finds.

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.830
They all go to the classes for them.

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.140
The rest of the files,

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.440
which are accessible toe the browsers are kept under the root off your project directly,

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.110
such as HTML file CSS,

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.210
JavaScript or in majors,

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.640
etcetera.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.060
You can also keep the JSP file inside the root off your applications.

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.250
However,

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.190
we don't want the end user to access.

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.920
The JSP is directly especially when you're using an architecture called model View

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:36.540
controller,

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.950
which we will discuss in the subsequent lectures.

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.150
In such cases,

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.060
we keep the jays before it's inside of Lebanon for low,

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.190
because Webern F is a folder,

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:50.470
which is only men for the subway and not for the claimed such as browsers.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.870
So if you keep a JSP file inside the van a folder,

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.830
the browsers can't make a request toe that particular JSP file.

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.920
So typically the way is that you make a request to a separate,

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.460
which is a Java program,

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:09.660
and that's all it does some work and then dispatches the control to a JSP and all these

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.550
things are happening in the server side and there is no problem in accessing the planet

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.990
folder.

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:18.560
And then the content of the JSP will be processed on the starboard side on.

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.950
An extreme in response will be given back to the client.

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.060
So this is the structure off war or Web archive file,

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.750
even though most of the time we don't come across with this particular fight.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:35.120
Once your project is really this is a way you deploy on application toe server in the next

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.720
lecture,

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.360
let's see how to set up Apache Tomcat on our eclipse
