00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.180
in this lecture,

00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:04.350
let's take a look at a concept called Freedom,

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.510
and it's popularly known as tablet filter.

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:08.050
Also,

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:11.360
the filter is almost like a separate.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.260
It has lifecycle functions like innit,

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:18.350
Destroy Andi do filter function.

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:19.200
Typically,

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.880
when a client makes a request,

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.940
the request is received by you about container like Apache.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:24.560
Dunk it,

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.550
and then the request is going to be forwarded toe the intended Sell it,

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.390
the sudden it has a function called service are different variants of the service like Do

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.320
Gate or do post etcetera on this already is supposed to give the response back to the

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.510
container on.

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.330
Then the container is going toe.

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:46.110
Given its TDP response back to the client,

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.290
sellers are map to to Ural patterns.

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.550
That is what the actual client uses.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:52.520
However,

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.450
a filters job is toe intercept an incoming request,

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.010
so the claim makes a request to the container.

00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.540
Container,

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.490
then passes the control toe.

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:03.550
The filters do filter function,

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.000
and that is where actually,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.170
you do some task that can be done before going to the actual separate and then pass the

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.440
control to the separate,

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.370
get the response back and then do additional tests and then do the control back to the

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:17.030
container,

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.850
and then the container sends the response back to the actual plant.

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.350
The Sunday pay our lows you to write multiple filters,

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:25.350
toe intercept,

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.990
given request and to facilitate the same thing.

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.490
You have an object called filter chain,

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.750
so the actual filter does not invoke.

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.350
The satellites are dysfunction,

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:37.480
but instead,

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.310
when the client request comes,

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.300
the request is received by the field to chain on.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:47.570
The filter chain has a list of filters that it has toe apply before the actual solid gets

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:48.250
the request.

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.300
Now the filter change takes the responsibility off in working the do filter function off

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.980
the filter,

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:54.670
for example,

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:55.390
feature one.

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:56.000
There is,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.230
um,

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:58.790
task done in the filter one Andi,

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:03.260
then the filter one is supposed to pass the control to the next filter,

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.460
but the filter one is not aware off other filters,

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.980
so it simply passes the control back to the filter chain toe.

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:11.330
Carry on the work off,

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.090
passing it to the next filter,

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.720
so the filter change takes the control back and then in walks,

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.950
the do filter on the next filter.

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.940
The second filter now does some task and then use the control back to the filter change to

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.150
carry on this test on the field,

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.540
the chain will now find that there is no other filters available.

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.330
Simply passes the control toe,

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:32.050
the Internet,

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.640
several it.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.520
Now the salad will do all it supposed to do,

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.160
such as reading the imports,

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.040
processing the input gendered in an HTML response,

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.560
adding that to date CDP response object and then give the control back to the Phil detained

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.000
because filter changes the one that,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.520
in order sarees function on the filter change now passes the control back to the filter,

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:54.050
too,

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.750
where some additional tests can be done,

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.140
after which it get the control back passes the controlled the filter.

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:05.220
One where additional tests off filter one can be performed and then the control comes back

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:06.150
to filter chain.

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.340
And now the feel the change gives the response back to the container container,

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.850
are additional headers and then sends it back to the actually claimed.

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.840
So this is another subject.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:17.950
Filters work,

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.300
and to have a better understanding,

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.870
let's take an example back in eclipse.

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.760
If I press command shift,

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:26.950
P r.

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.610
Control shifty on Windows,

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:30.450
you get the open type,

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.880
and if you type your filter,

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:38.150
you can see that there is an interface called Filter from Jolla Extort Summit.

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:39.930
If I click on open,

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.150
you can see that the filter interface has couple of functions.

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.730
The functions are nothing but in it,

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.150
which takes the filter conflict as an argument.

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.310
The 2nd 1 is the Do Filter,

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:55.350
which takes solid request solid response on a filter chain reference.

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.670
And then you have the third life second function,

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:58.710
which is called the Strike.

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:00.850
So if you're reading a class,

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:03.250
you have to implement these functions.

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:04.130
Of course,

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.260
you can see a small notation here called the Demons Default,

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:14.040
which means that you don't have toe implement dysfunction because there is a default method

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.450
body in the filter into faith itself.

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:17.190
So let's go,

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.520
Andre,

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:23.080
that class that implements this particular filter and configure that to intercept a request

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.550
on one of our existing for it.

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.460
So let's write a filter that can intercept this table.

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:30.540
Sell it now.

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:31.930
Here is our tables are left,

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.860
which is actually reading and input from the request perimeter.

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.870
It is checking whether input is not are not,

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.370
and then it is strange to convert that into an indicia,

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.520
generating an HTML table on.

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.250
Then the output stream is closer,

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:48.650
and this is the Ural patent that we're goingto ask the filter to intercept,

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:52.570
and the salad is involved from our table knowledge team away.

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:56.770
We are actually accepting and number and then invoking that several it.

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:58.200
So to write a filter,

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.600
let's right.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:06.450
Click on the Web package and then say new class on Let's give the name of the filter as

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:07.960
table filter,

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:12.380
and the filter plus must implement an interface called Filter.

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:16.140
I will click on the add button here and then type your filter.

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:18.440
Select that click on finish,

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:23.210
and you may see that there is only one function that it says you're over it,

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:25.450
although there are two more functions,

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:27.610
which is the in it and destroyed.

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:28.680
If you want,

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.090
you can add it manually.

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:30.670
For example,

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:34.720
I can come here and then type control space and then type You're in it.

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:37.960
You can see we got a lifecycle function called in it.

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:44.460
Let's get off this and then come here and then are another lifecycle function called

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:44.960
destroying.

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:46.800
Let's get up these two lines,

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.830
like the summer it's a filter.

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:51.190
Object is also a singleton,

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:55.200
which means that there is only one instance off this class ever.

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:57.230
When that instant is created,

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:02.150
this unity is called first Onda that gets the filter configuration object.

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:02.670
Typically,

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:08.960
this town figure object gets the metta later from either and examine or an traditions such

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:10.350
as the unit parameters.

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:12.960
I'm just gonna put a system that out there.

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:18.410
Prindle in here saying that the table filter is created onda similar output.

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:23.560
I want to give even in the best right seeing that table filter is destroyed.

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:24.810
I did that.

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:31.350
Do Filter also lets art such a statement and say table filter dot do filter called.

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:33.750
And very importantly,

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:38.600
we have toe configure this filter toe intercept certain type of requests.

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:42.130
You can either use the web dot xml toto such configuration,

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:45.040
or we can use annotations first,

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:50.150
let's take an example of web dot XML and then come back and add the in addition to replace

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:51.250
the XML content.

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:57.610
So let's go over by enough Bender ec salmon somewhere after the welcome finalist.

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:01.260
Let's are a filter on slash filter.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.750
The filter type must have a filter name.

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:08.230
This will be used later toe.

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:09.010
Do the mapping.

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:10.840
So right now we're gonna say Filter name.

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:15.810
Let's call it last F one on another mandatory type is the filter class.

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:18.350
This is nothing with the class that we just know created.

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:20.090
It's under the package called out.

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:23.950
We no doubt that the name is called table Filter.

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:27.130
The filter can be given additional innit perimeter.

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:28.910
So we have something called innit?

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:29.950
Dash bottom.

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:31.600
And then you can say,

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:33.730
What is the name off the pattern?

00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:34.820
So apparently,

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:35.250
let's say,

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:36.350
for example,

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:37.050
test.

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:39.290
And then there Param value.

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:42.370
Let's say I give my name.

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:43.300
We not come on.

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:45.980
So this defines the filter object,

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:48.450
but the filter object must have a mapping.

00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:52.550
Either you're a pattern or a specific.

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:54.650
Sell it that you want to intercept.

00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:56.340
Let's go and give the same thing.

00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:57.650
It's a separate tag.

00:07:57.650 --> 00:08:01.520
We have to type your filter dash mapping on.

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:02.200
We need toe.

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:03.640
Say that this is a filter.

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:04.950
We want toe use,

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:09.090
and this is the Ural pattern that we want to intercept.

00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:09.610
In Arcade.

00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:11.020
It's called slash table.

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:12.620
Let's format this.

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:19.210
Save it now are filter configuration is really when the dunk it starts this filter gets

00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:22.210
instance created and obviously the constructor off.

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:23.730
This is being called first.

00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:26.430
Soon after the constructor is finished,

00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:29.300
the table filter that in it is going to be called on.

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:31.080
This will be accessible.

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:34.650
Why are the object that we received here called filter country?

00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:41.580
I can probably even display here filter conflict dot Get You can see there,

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:43.650
there any calumet and names.

00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:48.050
This is going to give an enumeration off all the filter names that we have.

00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:51.180
I have only one called test on dykan.

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:54.130
Just say here they give you the value for test on.

00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:56.150
This can give me the value.

00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:57.600
If it is found other,

00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:58.740
it's going to give you none.

00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:07.080
And I can also it just probably print that message saying innit parameter test equals two

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:08.310
and then I take test.

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:09.480
So apart from this,

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:12.350
there is no major use of the filter conflict object.

00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:15.590
It also has access toe the subject context,

00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:17.570
which is nothing with the application scope.

00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:20.840
So you can store something in that if you want all,

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:25.690
if any other filter has stood some daytime that so you can probably try to make it so that

00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:32.110
here as well So let's say all the files on then run the table marriage team on the server,

00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:37.750
so I'm indirectly con table html Select runners run on survival.

00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:41.960
Now we have the table that it's human,

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:47.860
So let's go back to eclipse first look at the console and you can see that in the console

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:52.360
of filter has bean initialized on the perimeter.

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:58.640
Name called The Test is nothing but the value I gave in the web dot xml as barren value,

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:00.950
which is we not come and that's what we're seeing over here.

00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:05.580
Now let's go and typing and number here on then bring the table.

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:07.550
We don't see any output here,

00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:08.320
Andi,

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:09.900
I'll tell you why in a minute.

00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:13.040
But if I go back toe clips and see the console,

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:15.820
you can see it a stable filter dot do filter called.

00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:18.410
So each time I do a reload here,

00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:20.090
you can see I did two times.

00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:21.550
You can see it three more times.

00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:23.720
I get in output over here on.

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:28.040
The reason why we're not getting any outward on the brother is because the request is

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:33.060
received by the filter on the filter is supposed to make it off all the perimeter is given

00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:34.350
by the user.

00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:36.030
Do some processing.

00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:40.100
Give it response back to the claimed by adding some content over here.

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:42.910
But that's exactly what we have subjects far.

00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:44.030
We don't want to do that.

00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:47.920
We want to do some common activities before going to the actual separate,

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:49.950
and that is where we have toe,

00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:53.130
make use of this filter chain and passed the control toe.

00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:57.250
The next available filter are to the Internet sublet.

00:10:57.250 --> 00:11:00.510
So let's first rename these parameters in tow.

00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:01.950
Let's a request.

00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:09.670
Let's call it as audience fee on Let's call it as FC and to proceed for Dario to say fc dot

00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:13.160
do filter and then passed the solid request,

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:14.400
which is not Arctic.

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:16.550
You on the responses R E S P.

00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:17.930
So from here,

00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:21.130
another control goes toe the next to filter if available.

00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:21.590
Otherwise,

00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:23.960
it goes to the intended salad object,

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:27.940
and the center object will perform its job in the service function.

00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:28.460
For example,

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:29.080
in our table,

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:30.790
some blood we are using the do get.

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:34.250
So the request in response eventually comes over here.

00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:36.310
We're doing all the processing over here,

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:37.750
generating some response,

00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:40.510
closing the output stream on after this,

00:11:40.510 --> 00:11:45.710
the filter change gets the control back because the do get waas involved by the filter

00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:51.330
chain and the filter change now gives the control back toe the filter because the change

00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:56.830
received the control from here and it gives the control back So I can against a here system

00:11:56.830 --> 00:12:04.520
that our doctrine tellin probably I can say your table filter dot do filter got the control

00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:05.690
back on.

00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:12.020
We can also print some message on the table sublet do get so that we know that in between

00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:13.110
this was called.

00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:18.920
So I'm gonna go there and then add one system that order parental and here saying table

00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:22.420
salad dot Do get waas called.

00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:27.970
Let's say all the files on Then run the HTML again I'm going to right click on table

00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:31.050
Extreme el rawness run on survival.

00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:33.950
And if you go back to eclipse,

00:12:33.950 --> 00:12:40.050
you must to see the filter initialization called the bizarrely Let me clear the console.

00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:44.590
Go back to the browser type in a number,

00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:46.160
Click on the printable.

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:46.780
Now,

00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:49.550
this time we got the output back here,

00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:50.950
just like earlier.

00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:52.940
But if I go back to the console,

00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:55.240
you can see that the table filter that do filter.

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:56.060
Waas called.

00:12:56.060 --> 00:13:00.850
But then the control waas transferred to the table selected or do get,

00:13:00.850 --> 00:13:02.330
and after that,

00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:07.150
the control received back by the table filter that do filter once again.

00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:10.730
So whatever that we have done in the web dot xml now,

00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:14.870
if you don't want to do it over here and you want to do it in the summer itself,

00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:15.980
let's do one thing.

00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:18.980
Let's come in this line by typing commands.

00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:22.150
Slash our control slash on Windows.

00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:27.270
And because of which dunker is not going to be aware off the filter safer restart,

00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:27.570
uncle,

00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:29.840
you would see that the filter will never come into picture.

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:30.690
However,

00:13:30.690 --> 00:13:35.960
we can go to the table filter that shower on an annotation here called underrate Graham

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:39.290
Filter on the Web filter has few elements.

00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:41.210
If oppressed controls face,

00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:44.250
you can see that there are a lot of options on.

00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:46.160
You can see that there is a innit problems,

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:53.140
which is basically a Web in its bottom at a so I can make it off that to supply the unit

00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:53.800
perimeters,

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:57.590
which is an area on there is also a name.

00:13:57.590 --> 00:14:02.310
If you want to give which is given in the form of filter name whiling that the maximal

00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:03.810
filter name is mandatory.

00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:04.220
Here,

00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:08.970
filter name is totally optional and tow intercept certain subjects.

00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:10.940
Either you can give the names of those.

00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:13.960
Suddenly you have Oregon behavioural patterns.

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:15.600
Both of them are array of string.

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:18.310
So I'm gonna use the Ural patterns here,

00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:20.550
which is nothing but an array off strings.

00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:26.300
And the only one summer that I want to intercept a slash table on the perimeter I want to

00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:27.720
give is a bunch of them.

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:32.590
So I'm gonna press enter here on then are added Web,

00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:33.150
innit?

00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:39.310
Parent on the name off the perimeter we want to give here is test and value.

00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:40.160
Is that say,

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:41.900
this time I want to give something else.

00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:42.890
Let's give Bangles,

00:14:42.890 --> 00:14:44.150
you save it.

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:45.870
And if you have multiple that,

00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:46.670
innit parameter,

00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:50.050
you can put a comma and then give one more attended unit.

00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:55.390
Param and you can say summit context got automatically reloaded and you can see table

00:14:55.390 --> 00:14:57.070
filter with instance created in it.

00:14:57.070 --> 00:14:58.510
Perimeter testicles,

00:14:58.510 --> 00:14:59.330
toe bangle.

00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:03.590
So which means it's already doing its job that clear the screen,

00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:10.020
go back and then send in another number with type for a fight with print table We Gonda

00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:10.950
output here.

00:15:10.950 --> 00:15:16.120
We also got an output on the console table filter that do filter was called,

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:18.170
and then the do get Waas called,

00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:21.250
and then the do filter waas called again.

00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:24.250
So this is the overall concept off base.

00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:27.730
Some red filter asunder Filters are very,

00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:28.850
very important.

00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:34.220
A lot of occasions when there are some common core needs to be done among multiple Sam

00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:36.550
allergic and always put that onto your filter.

00:15:36.550 --> 00:15:37.320
Or,

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:40.950
if you have a scenario where a lot off textbooks will lose,

00:15:40.950 --> 00:15:43.680
are supposed to be converted into an entity object,

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:45.570
and this is requiring multiple subjects.

00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:47.460
You can always put that in a filter.

00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:50.840
You can almost check whether the user has logged in or not.

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:52.190
If the user has not lovin,

00:15:52.190 --> 00:15:57.400
you might want to relate the user to some other page so you can conditionally in walk those

00:15:57.400 --> 00:16:00.800
sunlit only if the user has logged in on like this.

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:04.950
There are many other use cases that can be addressed using a satellite filter,

00:16:04.950 --> 00:16:06.980
so that's all for this lecture.

00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:08.300
Sear in the next one
