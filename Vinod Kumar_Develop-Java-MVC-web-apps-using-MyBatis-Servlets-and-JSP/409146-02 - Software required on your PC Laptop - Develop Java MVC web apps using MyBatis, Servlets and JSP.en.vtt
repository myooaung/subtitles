00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.480
So let's talk about the software requirement on your PC or laptop to get started with this

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.950
course.

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:10.990
So the number one software requirement is the Jerry Krg R E.

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:13.370
We are using Wonder Aid washing,

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:15.950
but you are free to use other Russians also.

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:18.550
But if you're reading 1.9 are a bow.

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:23.300
The product structures may look a little different than what I'm using in my projects,

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.050
because I'm using Wonder eight,

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.650
and the 2nd 1 is the Eclipse ide the for our E developers.

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.890
If you don't have anyone off these two software's,

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:35.480
there's a link in the description.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.510
Please use that link and then download the same thing.

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.750
Others after requirement for this course would be a Web server on the DB Server.

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.730
Both of these we will install during the course of the training for the date of its our

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.470
were were using hedge toe database engine.

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:52.960
But if you have my SQL,

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.070
you can use it without any problem.

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.800
As long as you know what is the driver class name.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:03.450
You are using him and password for the website where we're gonna be using Apache Tomcat

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:04.050
nine.

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:10.210
But if you want to use the logic or Web sphere or glass fish go and use the same thing.

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.250
But I would not be covering as part of the course here.

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.100
So that's all for this lecture.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.040
In the next lecture,

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.850
let's get started with my batteries.
