00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.390
In the previous lecture,

00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:04.260
we saw how to handle quite distinct perimeters,

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:07.390
but this particular program has some flus.

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:08.020
Let's say,

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:08.780
for example,

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.190
if I remove this question mark Numb equals to 12.

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:13.560
Press enter.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.600
You can see that we got an editor.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.350
Other Court Finder intern Answer were better.

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:19.470
It is number.

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:20.670
Former exception Now.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.800
Now the reason for the days since there is no quite a stink perimeter here,

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.290
the function requested get perimeter off,

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:29.930
none returned and none.

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:31.340
So that's not an error.

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:32.450
It simply return.

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.670
Now.

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:36.220
Over here on integer that person off null,

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.210
is the one that is causing a problem.

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:39.590
So that's lying Number 20.

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:40.300
Over here,

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.150
you can see that it is table cellar door.

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:47.300
Java line number 20 is the one that through this particular exception,

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.330
similarly,

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.150
there is a possibility off another.

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.040
In case if I have supplied the numb,

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.800
but it's a non numeric value like ASD,

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.230
you get a similar number.

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:58.970
Former exception,

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:00.430
Foreign pushing ASD.

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.850
So 200 this let's go back to our core.

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.930
This is where input may probably none,

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:13.000
so we check your If input equals toe none.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.090
We can produce an output.

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.160
Saying that Hey,

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.460
the input cannot be No,

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.050
But most probably this is happening because the user is trained to access a submarine

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.460
directly without the HTML file.

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:25.370
Ultimately,

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:29.540
we can redirect the user back to the table dot html.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.650
Now this can be done in two ways.

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.200
The number one method is called climb,

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.360
said Redirection.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:43.050
The way you do is you say your response dot send redirect and then say where we want to go

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.210
that this can be an absolute parts are related part,

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.540
which means I can read that at the user toe.

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:55.960
A different website altogether are I can redirect the user toe location with in my

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:56.730
application.

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:57.580
For example,

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.030
if I type your dot slash table dot html,

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.980
it'll assume that this is a religion part dot Slash is not really required.

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:10.710
It will assume that this is a religion part because it didn't start with their double slash

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:13.550
Are heads to to be colon double slash,

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.830
so it allows him that did the radio part.

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.970
It visits the same website again,

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.790
but this time it's going to go for a table there.

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:21.240
HTML.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.350
Now this function does not take the control out off this function so you still have to say

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.790
written so that we don't want to process this statements anymore.

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:36.000
So if input is not the use that will be redirected the table,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.860
that it's demon.

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:37.770
However,

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.780
what happens if there is a problem over here,

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:41.570
for example,

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.220
the user has entered a SDF,

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.250
so the perimeter is found.

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:47.240
It is not know,

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.880
so this escaped.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.370
But eventually this will because it problems.

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.250
So we can handle that by printing the message directly to the user saying that Hey,

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.620
you can only input integers and not anything else.

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.820
So that has to be done after we get the output stream.

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.150
So I'm gonna cut this and paste over here.

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:12.430
Let's select this section and then say Right click surround with try catch block.

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.340
So if there is no other processing this function,

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:22.130
then it is a valid number and we proceed by printing the multiplication table for the same

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.130
.

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.630
But if there is an exception for this particular statement,

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.000
it's number for Mitt exception.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.980
So it's being caught.

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:36.200
Hold here on Allah Minuto is to type out dark brindle and X three invalid input only

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.350
integers are alert.

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:42.300
Let's put a slash h three semicolon over here.

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.230
Let's go to the settlers and you can see the sources restart.

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.650
Let's click on this icon toe restart.

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.160
So sorry,

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.150
what is now ready?

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.660
Let's go back to our application.

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.360
Let's go try once again.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.630
So we go to the table dot It's Yemen on.

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:59.720
We have a number.

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.610
Let's type your say 12 were able toe print the table.

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:04.450
No problem.

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:09.440
But if I go back here and type heirs day and take on print table comes back and says

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:10.460
Invalid input.

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:14.080
Only in Peter's are alone on in Calif.

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.830
I remove this question mark.

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:18.130
Now Michels Toe is the and press enter.

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.940
You'll see that it is redirected toe the HTML file.

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:27.120
You can also see that the change in the Ural I'm actually removing this dotage demon and

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.180
then press enter.

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.470
It is actually doing a redirection.

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:31.300
Let's right,

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:32.760
click on instead.

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.920
That takes me to the develop or tools.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:41.080
Let's go to the network and make sure that you have selected all over here on I'm gonna

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.910
select table and then press enter.

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:45.140
And when I do that,

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:48.860
you can see that it is you visited table.

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.070
So if I click on this table,

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.250
it says Under headers,

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:56.450
Let's go toe the response headers.

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:57.140
It is here.

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:59.530
The location is stable or estimates,

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:05.270
so because there is a location as well as the 302 status scored,

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:08.780
so it is automatically redirecting the user toe.

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:11.930
This particular HTML files the table dot It's human.

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:16.360
So it is a climb savory direction because you're asking the client,

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.790
which is nothing but the browser toe redirected that particular location on.

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:25.690
You will always see a change in the address whenever you see a client redirection.

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:29.390
So we have handled all Tony institution in this case.

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:32.420
So whether you take a non numerical value,

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:34.850
are you wizard the sunlight directly.

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:36.990
Both of them have been handled properly.

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:38.740
Let's go back to eclipse.

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:43.250
So this is how you do client redirection in a separate application
