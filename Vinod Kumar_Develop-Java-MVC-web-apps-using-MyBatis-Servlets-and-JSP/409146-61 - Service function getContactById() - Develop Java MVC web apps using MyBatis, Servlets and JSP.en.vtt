00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.250
in this lecture.

00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:04.890
Let's create a function in the service class that,

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.480
actually for Saul for this deal will function.

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:12.750
Let's go to the context salaries writer function somewhere at the bottom.

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.590
Let's make some room here on the right,

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:21.350
a function here that takes idea the perimeter and then returns a contact object.

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:26.550
So the function is gonna be public returns a contact object.

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:27.590
It's called us.

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.850
Get contact by idee.

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:31.490
And let's take ideas.

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:32.760
The first perimeter here.

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.820
So into your I d on.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.250
Unlike the other service functions that received enters as an object here,

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.980
this may not require the others object because there is not much validation left here

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.770
because the user is supplying an idee.

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.020
And we take this,

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.490
I d try to get the data from the database.

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:54.680
If there is data,

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.630
we will return that as a contact object.

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.550
If there is no data we're gonna written and no object,

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.170
you can think of some validations like I cannot be.

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.480
No,

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:09.170
our idea cannot be less than r equals 20 All those things you can add.

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:10.770
But in my opinion,

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.750
those allegations are not necessary because in case if you're supplying a negative number

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:16.330
or No,

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:17.730
we don't have a record.

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:19.810
We're simply going to return now anyways,

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.120
so let me not add the validation edits over here.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.810
I'm gonna open their bracket,

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.480
and then I'm gonna copy this line where I'm creating an instance off Contact Dio and then

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:30.980
based here on.

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:32.090
Then I will say here,

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:39.210
return deal dot get contact and then supply this Heidi dysfunction itself is going to take

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.740
care of returning null in case the I d doesn't have a corresponding record deal Factory.

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:45.580
Don't get contact,

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.820
dear.

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.310
What throws an Iot exception?

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.140
Let's simply throw it away for them.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.700
Save our fight and our service function is really so.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:55.950
That's all for this lecture.

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.330
In the next lecture,

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.060
let's set a cantonal toe handle this year's case.
