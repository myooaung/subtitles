Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.840
My name is Ryan Lewis, and welcome to my course,

3
00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.480
Practicing CI/CD with AWS CodePipeline.

4
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.390
I've been architecting applications in AWS for many years in my

5
00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.270
work for large enterprises as a cloud engineer,

6
00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:24.440
and I've used CodePipeline for CI/CD in both large and small projects.

7
00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.630
Coding and development is just one part of creating software,

8
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.470
and figuring out how to get your awesome application to users isn't easy.

9
00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:33.860
If you're working in AWS,

10
00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.390
then CodePipeline is going to be your new best friend for

11
00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.040
building and deploying your applications.

12
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.730
In this course,

13
00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.510
we're going to create a pipeline in CodePipeline to

14
00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.340
build and deploy a demo application.

15
00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.920
Some of the major topics that we will cover include deployment

16
00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.440
from CodePipeline, running automated tests,

17
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.610
invoking Lambda functions from a pipeline, and

18
00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.640
CodePipeline monitoring and notifications.

19
00:00:58.640 --> 00:00:59.770
By the end of this course,

20
00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.810
you'll have all the tools needed to use CodePipeline

21
00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:06.040
for your CI/CD needs with AWS.

22
00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.390
Before beginning the course,

23
00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.440
you should have a good understanding of AWS services

24
00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.940
and have some experience using them.

25
00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:26.000
I hope you'll join me on this journey to learn CodePipeline with the Practicing CI/CD with AWS CodePipeline course, at Pluralsight
