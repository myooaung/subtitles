Stage transitions are what happens between the stages of your pipeline.

2
00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.190
Every pipeline is created with stage transitions enabled by default,

3
00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:16.290
as it was when we created our demo pipeline. Stage transitions can be disabled,

4
00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:19.840
and then progress of a pipeline execution would halt.

5
00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.130
This can be useful if you want to freeze your pipeline.

6
00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.070
It's especially useful if you have the pipeline connected to source control,

7
00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.910
which may cause unnecessary builds as your team develops on an

8
00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.550
application. Stage transitions aren't a good fit if you're looking for

9
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.100
a way to block the pipeline before deploying.

10
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.060
Manual approvals, which we looked at in the last module,

11
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.600
are a better fit for that.

12
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.340
Let's take a look at how to disable and enable stage transitions.

13
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.800
Open up your pipeline,

14
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.440
and between each stage you'll see a Disable transition button.

15
00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.470
This is where you'll disable transitions,

16
00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.240
so click the one between the source and build stages.

17
00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:03.250
A modal will pop up and require you to add a reason.

18
00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.250
This is a good place to put something like enable after June

19
00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.140
15th, or write more integration tests.

20
00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.640
Put a reason here and then click the Disable button.

21
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.850
Now you can see a small disabled icon has appeared and the

22
00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.000
button changed to Enable transition.

23
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.610
If the source action were to be executed here from a commit to source control,

24
00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.040
it wouldn't go any further, and the build stage would not be executed.

25
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.180
Now if we enable transitions,

26
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.320
the pipeline execution will continue based on the last change that took

27
00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.920
place. There's no need to manually kick it off again.

28
00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:41.940
Let's do that.

29
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.300
Click the Enable transition button.

30
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.830
You can see it gives you details with the reason we

31
00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.970
entered and when it was disabled.

32
00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.470
This is good information if you come back from the weekend and can't

33
00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.730
really remember why you disabled transitions on your pipeline. Click

34
00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.630
the Enable button, and your pipeline will go back to normal execution

35
00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:08.000
if the source action has executed. And that's all you need to know about stage transitions.
