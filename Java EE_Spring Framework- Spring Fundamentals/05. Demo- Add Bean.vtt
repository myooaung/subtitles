Adding a bean inside of our applicationContext is very similar to

2
00:00:04.572 --> 00:00:08.065
adding it to the AppConfig that we had before.

3
00:00:08.065 --> 00:00:12.728
We want to do an open angle bracket and use the bean alias.

4
00:00:12.728 --> 00:00:14.237
And inside of here,

5
00:00:14.237 --> 00:00:18.465
it gives us a bunch of different properties that we can use for this.

6
00:00:18.465 --> 00:00:22.293
I'm going to start by choosing name as the first one,

7
00:00:22.293 --> 00:00:30.034
and the name that we want to do for this is the speakerRepository.

8
00:00:30.034 --> 00:00:32.095
The next thing that we want to do is add the class.

9
00:00:32.095 --> 00:00:39.982
And the class that we're going to do for this is com.pluralsight.

10
00:00:39.982 --> 00:00:45.373
And we want to specifically choose our repository.

11
00:00:45.373 --> 00:00:51.376
And we want this to be an instance of the HibernateSpeakerRepositoryImpl.

12
00:00:51.376 --> 00:00:56.093
Now in our code, we are going to reference this using the interface,

13
00:00:56.093 --> 00:00:59.611
but we'll create the bean with the implementation.

14
00:00:59.611 --> 00:01:02.313
I'll show you more what I mean by that here in a second.

15
00:01:02.313 --> 00:01:07.836
But this is actually all we needed to do to create our bean definition.

16
00:01:07.836 --> 00:01:09.873
Now we're not injecting anything in this,

17
00:01:09.873 --> 00:01:13.120
in fact, that's why I started with this bean is because if you remember,

18
00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.165
our SpeakerRepositoryImpl has no other dependencies in it.

19
00:01:17.165 --> 00:01:21.619
I'm going to open that up so you can take a look at it.

20
00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:26.923
It was just a very simple hard-coded one method list of speakers that

21
00:01:26.923 --> 00:01:31.247
gets returned from what would be a mock database,

22
00:01:31.247 --> 00:01:33.597
so there's nothing being injected in this yet.

23
00:01:33.597 --> 00:01:36.050
We're going to go through and look at setter injection a little bit

24
00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.450
and actually reference our Java configuration that we did to show

25
00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.909
you the two and come back and wire this up to be setter injected

26
00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:53.000
for the SpeakerService with this bean that we just created in the SpeakerRepository.
