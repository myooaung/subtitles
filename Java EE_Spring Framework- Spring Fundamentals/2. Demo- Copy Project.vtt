00:00:01.373 --> 00:00:04.963
To get our project ready to copy for the next demo,

2
00:00:04.963 --> 00:00:09.710
I've gone ahead and closed any of the open files we had from the previous demo.

3
00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:12.621
To copy a project inside of IntelliJ,

4
00:00:12.621 --> 00:00:15.915
you actually don't do it inside of the IDE itself.

5
00:00:15.915 --> 00:00:20.187
You do it at the filesystem, so I'm going to switch over to my finder window,

6
00:00:20.187 --> 00:00:23.363
and you want to right-click on your folder,

7
00:00:23.363 --> 00:00:27.164
and just say Copy, and actually Paste.

8
00:00:27.164 --> 00:00:27.565
That's it.

9
00:00:27.565 --> 00:00:28.367
Just a simple copy/paste.

10
00:00:28.367 --> 00:00:29.314
You can do it from the command line,

11
00:00:29.314 --> 00:00:31.243
you can do it from your Windows Explorer window.

12
00:00:31.243 --> 00:00:32.057
I'm on a Mac.

13
00:00:32.057 --> 00:00:33.684
I can do it in my finder window.

14
00:00:33.684 --> 00:00:36.451
And you want to go ahead and change the name of this

15
00:00:36.451 --> 00:00:38.290
folder to whatever you'd like it to be.

16
00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:39.860
So I'm going to name mine conference-java,

17
00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.720
and then you want to switch back to your IDE.

18
00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.392
Once in my IDE, I want to go ahead and go to File,

19
00:00:48.392 --> 00:00:52.711
Open, and navigate down to that project,

20
00:00:52.711 --> 00:00:58.869
and select it, and you have a choice of New Window or This Window.

21
00:00:58.869 --> 00:00:59.881
I'm going to choose This Window.

22
00:00:59.881 --> 00:01:03.617
It actually replaces the existing contents we have with our new project,

23
00:01:03.617 --> 00:01:06.026
just so we're not confused about which one we're doing,

24
00:01:06.026 --> 00:01:09.915
any edits or anything like that.

25
00:01:09.915 --> 00:01:12.778
And then I've got to do a couple of things before we

26
00:01:12.778 --> 00:01:15.183
just get going and dive right in.

27
00:01:15.183 --> 00:01:20.218
First off, I want to make sure that the project was renamed,

28
00:01:20.218 --> 00:01:23.644
but it never actually renames the conference.iml.

29
00:01:23.644 --> 00:01:28.474
To rename that, we want to right-click on it and say Refactor,

30
00:01:28.474 --> 00:01:31.593
Rename, and change that to whatever our project name is,

31
00:01:31.593 --> 00:01:33.278
so mine was conference-java.

32
00:01:33.278 --> 00:01:35.906
If you did something else, you will want to name it that,

33
00:01:35.906 --> 00:01:37.974
obviously, and click Refactor.

34
00:01:37.974 --> 00:01:41.787
And then I'm going to open up my pom.xml and change

35
00:01:41.787 --> 00:01:44.482
the artifactId to conference-java.

36
00:01:44.482 --> 00:01:46.690
I'm going to do this just so that there isn't any

37
00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.058
conflicting Maven artifacts out there.

38
00:01:49.058 --> 00:01:54.103
If we did a Maven install or a publish, they wouldn't clash with one another.

39
00:01:54.103 --> 00:01:56.552
Now, we've got those changes made.

40
00:01:56.552 --> 00:02:02.499
I'm going to go ahead and navigate to my source, main, java, Application file.

41
00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:05.752
And you can open it up or you can right- click on it and run it from there.

42
00:02:05.752 --> 00:02:07.845
If I right-click on the main method and say Run,

43
00:02:07.845 --> 00:02:13.872
the first time we do this, it's going to pull up this Edit configuration dialog.

44
00:02:13.872 --> 00:02:17.859
The Edit configuration dialog wants us to change two specific things.

45
00:02:17.859 --> 00:02:19.671
The use of the classpath module,

46
00:02:19.671 --> 00:02:21.984
you'll see right now it says that no module is selected,

47
00:02:21.984 --> 00:02:23.790
and that's because we moved it and renamed it.

48
00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.196
So I want to choose conference-java, again,

49
00:02:26.196 --> 00:02:28.754
if you renamed yours something else,

50
00:02:28.754 --> 00:02:32.356
you'll want to choose that classpath module name.

51
00:02:32.356 --> 00:02:35.287
And you want to make sure you have the JRE installed.

52
00:02:35.287 --> 00:02:35.699
So,

53
00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:39.767
you have a default option if you've configured that inside of

54
00:02:39.767 --> 00:02:42.581
your IDE or you can choose a specific version.

55
00:02:42.581 --> 00:02:46.735
I'm going to go ahead and choose Java 11.0 .2 to make sure that

56
00:02:46.735 --> 00:02:49.455
that's the one that I always want this to run with,

57
00:02:49.455 --> 00:02:51.750
and I want to click Run.

58
00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.496
Then our application will build for a second and open up and run,

59
00:02:54.496 --> 00:02:59.593
and you should see the output from our previous demo the

60
00:02:59.593 --> 00:03:01.809
same as in our new copied project.

61
00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:04.323
So we should see that Bryan, or if you used your name there,

62
00:03:04.323 --> 00:03:07.467
output, and it finishes with an exit code of 0.

63
00:03:07.467 --> 00:03:10.333
If you get anything but this,

64
00:03:10.333 --> 00:03:13.034
you have something not copied correctly or configured right,

65
00:03:13.034 --> 00:03:16.000
so make sure you fix that before you move on. To begin configuring
