Here is a snippet of just the beans namespace definition that

2
00:00:04,113 --> 00:00:07,487
I just copied to the top of our XML file.

3
00:00:07,487 --> 00:00:10,745
I believe that the misunderstanding of namespaces is one of the reasons

4
00:00:10,745 --> 00:00:14,908
that people are afraid of XML and using XML configuration.

5
00:00:14,908 --> 00:00:18,629
Spring has created this namespace that simply acts like a

6
00:00:18,629 --> 00:00:22,328
dictionary for the properties that we can use to create a

7
00:00:22,328 --> 00:00:24,403
bean inside of our application.

8
00:00:24,403 --> 00:00:27,629
Let's talk a little bit more about these properties.

9
00:00:27,629 --> 00:00:32,877
So our XML declaration allows us to define a bean in XML.

10
00:00:32,877 --> 00:00:36,163
This bean is called a CustomerServiceImpl bean,

11
00:00:36,163 --> 00:00:38,716
and it represents where we want to put our business

12
00:00:38,716 --> 00:00:41,380
logic inside of our application.

13
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:43,282
There's a few other properties to find in this example as well

14
00:00:43,282 --> 00:00:45,247
that we're going to walk through more in detail,

15
00:00:45,247 --> 00:00:49,471
but you can see the pieces that we are creating here.

16
00:00:49,471 --> 00:00:53,919
The beans are essentially just classes.

17
00:00:53,919 --> 00:00:58,640
The XML configuration is composed of beans just like our AppConfig was as well,

18
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,322
and they're just POJOs that we use inside of our application context.

19
00:01:02,322 --> 00:01:06,551
Defining beans can be thought of as replacing the keyword new.

20
00:01:06,551 --> 00:01:10,191
So whether you are in your application or you're saying something

21
00:01:10,191 --> 00:01:13,320
like your _____ CustomerService = CustomerServiceMy,

22
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:20,144
CustomerService = new ServiceImpl, wherever we're using that keyword new,

23
00:01:20,144 --> 00:01:23,335
that's something that should be thought about being put

24
00:01:23,335 --> 00:01:26,421
in your XML or Java configuration.

25
00:01:26,421 --> 00:01:30,167
Lastly, we always want to define the class,

26
00:01:30,167 --> 00:01:37,000
but use the interface, and I'll show you what I mean by that in our demo that's following this.
