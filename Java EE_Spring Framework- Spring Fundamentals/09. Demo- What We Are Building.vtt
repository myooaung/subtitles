00:00:01.185 --> 00:00:04.208
Since this is an update for this course,

2
00:00:04.208 --> 00:00:07.496
we're trying to standardize the application that we

3
00:00:07.496 --> 00:00:10.354
used to build across multiple courses.

4
00:00:10.354 --> 00:00:13.507
And we've opted to do a conference registration app,

5
00:00:13.507 --> 00:00:17.302
and we're going to specifically focus on the model

6
00:00:17.302 --> 00:00:20.725
and wiring of this application.

7
00:00:20.725 --> 00:00:23.905
We're going to be looking at a conference application and the

8
00:00:23.905 --> 00:00:26.288
configuration that we do throughout that.

9
00:00:26.288 --> 00:00:31.143
We'll focus primarily on the model of that wiring so the session objects for

10
00:00:31.143 --> 00:00:34.969
the conference session and the speakers for those sessions,

11
00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:45.000
and we may add attendees in there as well to demonstrate all of the characteristics that we want to for wiring up this application.
