00:00:01,295 --> 00:00:03,888
What problem is Spring trying to solve?

2
00:00:03,888 --> 00:00:08,206
Whenever I'm going to introduce another framework or tool into my code base,

3
00:00:08,206 --> 00:00:10,279
I want to look and see what it's actually buying me.

4
00:00:10,279 --> 00:00:15,330
These are the big questions I ask, what is this trying to solve for me?

5
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:18,690
Well, Spring brings to the table quite a few things.

6
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:21,503
It increases our testability.

7
00:00:21,503 --> 00:00:26,256
It increases our maintainability or the ability to maintain our code.

8
00:00:26,256 --> 00:00:29,032
It also helps us with scalability.

9
00:00:29,032 --> 00:00:32,151
I call these the ables, the testable, maintainable,

10
00:00:32,151 --> 00:00:34,424
scalable-type properties of our code.

11
00:00:34,424 --> 00:00:38,696
It decouples things and makes it so that we can add caching layers,

12
00:00:38,696 --> 00:00:40,775
things like that in there.

13
00:00:40,775 --> 00:00:43,165
There's a little bit beyond the scope of what we're

14
00:00:43,165 --> 00:00:44,529
going to cover in this class,

15
00:00:44,529 --> 00:00:48,706
but these are all focused at Spring and the principles

16
00:00:48,706 --> 00:00:51,370
behind Spring help us deliver on.

17
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:54,443
It also helps us reduce code complexity.

18
00:00:54,443 --> 00:00:55,277
And lastly, though,

19
00:00:55,277 --> 00:00:58,534
and this is my biggest point that it tries to solve for us is

20
00:00:58,534 --> 00:01:02,269
that it puts the focus on our business.

21
00:01:02,269 --> 00:01:05,009
The business doesn't care what framework I'm using.

22
00:01:05,009 --> 00:01:07,684
They care about what we're getting coded done,

23
00:01:07,684 --> 00:01:11,545
and Spring helps us get complex code done faster,

24
00:01:11,545 --> 00:01:21,000
makes it more maintainable, testable, and helps remove that complexity, and just makes everything a little bit easier for us as a developer.
