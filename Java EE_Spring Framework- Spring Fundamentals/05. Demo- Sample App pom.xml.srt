1
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:03,070
Before we go any further inside of our application,

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:08,099
there is actually one thing we need to fix inside of our pom.xml,

3
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:12,422
and this has been the case for every IDE I have ever used.

4
00:00:12,422 --> 00:00:18,286
We need to add a specific build version for our app.

5
00:00:18,286 --> 00:00:22,981
Now you can go look in the Maven course and see why and what.

6
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:27,635
Suffice it to say that we want to go below the last line of version,

7
00:00:27,635 --> 00:00:30,372
but before we have closed off our project.

8
00:00:30,372 --> 00:00:33,326
So you can see in my example here, after line 9,

9
00:00:33,326 --> 00:00:35,810
I've added some whitespace, so on line 11,

10
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:37,564
I'm going to add this build section,

11
00:00:37,564 --> 00:00:40,003
and I'm just going to paste it in and walk you through it.

12
00:00:40,003 --> 00:00:41,910
You can add it on your own.

13
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:46,364
So I have added in here a build section,

14
00:00:46,364 --> 00:00:48,632
and inside of that, there is a plugins section,

15
00:00:48,632 --> 00:00:52,013
plural, and then an individual configured plugin.

16
00:00:52,013 --> 00:00:53,579
And in here,

17
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:58,785
we have a groupId of org.apache .maven .plugins and an

18
00:00:58,785 --> 00:01:02,871
artifactId of maven-compiler-plugin.

19
00:01:02,871 --> 00:01:05,971
The version is 3.8 .1,

20
00:01:05,971 --> 00:01:09,805
and the configuration is where we specify that we want

21
00:01:09,805 --> 00:01:15,962
Java 11 and a target of Java 11, so the source Java 11 and the target Java 11.

22
00:01:15,962 --> 00:01:19,581
If you don't do this the first time you go to run your application,

23
00:01:19,581 --> 00:01:24,070
it will come back and tell you that it doesn't support Java 5.

24
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:27,256
Now one thing that I think IntelliJ doesn't do a very

25
00:01:27,256 --> 00:01:29,506
good job of is warning you of that.

26
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:31,472
Some of the other IDs will tell you that this is

27
00:01:31,472 --> 00:01:34,078
compiling it down to a Java 5 version,

28
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:38,063
and that's because IntelliJ will compile code as you go using their

29
00:01:38,063 --> 00:01:43,596
internal IDE compiler and not the Maven compiler.

30
00:01:43,596 --> 00:01:46,909
So they're going through and checking code as you go,

31
00:01:46,909 --> 00:01:50,510
and it's compiling it to Java 11, but when you go to run the application,

32
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:53,170
it will run it with what the default is in Maven,

33
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:56,309
which, by default, is Java 5.

34
00:01:56,309 --> 00:02:01,000
So this is how you override to tell it to use Java 11. Now that we have our Maven
