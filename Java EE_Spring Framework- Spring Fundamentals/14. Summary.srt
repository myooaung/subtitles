00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:03,447
Let's recap quickly what we learned in this module.

2
00:00:03,447 --> 00:00:05,813
We covered quite a few things, and it was a fairly large module,

3
00:00:05,813 --> 00:00:11,179
and it set up for us all of the upcoming modules that we're going to go through.

4
00:00:11,179 --> 00:00:14,904
We discussed why we'd want to use Spring and what it's

5
00:00:14,904 --> 00:00:17,164
buying us inside of our application.

6
00:00:17,164 --> 00:00:18,809
We went through and looked at the prerequisites that we

7
00:00:18,809 --> 00:00:21,848
had for our application and set those up for what we're

8
00:00:21,848 --> 00:00:23,626
going to do in future modules.

9
00:00:23,626 --> 00:00:27,426
We built a demo app and went through the details of that demo app and

10
00:00:27,426 --> 00:00:31,215
discussed the pain points inside of our demo app and why we want to

11
00:00:31,215 --> 00:00:34,761
use Spring to remove some of these critical pieces that are hard

12
00:00:34,761 --> 00:00:37,231
coded inside of our application.

13
00:00:37,231 --> 00:00:39,106
Then we went ahead and downloaded Spring and

14
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:40,677
incorporated that inside of our application,

15
00:00:40,677 --> 00:00:45,423
and you saw how quickly and easily it was done using Maven.

16
00:00:45,423 --> 00:00:49,611
The next module that we're going to do is the Java configuration module.

17
00:00:49,611 --> 00:00:50,723
Now I want to caution you.

18
00:00:50,723 --> 00:00:54,084
A lot of people are real quick to want to skip the XML

19
00:00:54,084 --> 00:00:57,126
portion of the configuration of this course,

20
00:00:57,126 --> 00:01:00,953
and we have even restructured it so that you go the Java section first.

21
00:01:00,953 --> 00:01:04,113
I do strongly feel that the XML section,

22
00:01:04,113 --> 00:01:04,524
though,

23
00:01:04,524 --> 00:01:07,626
helps people understand the separation of concerns somewhat

24
00:01:07,626 --> 00:01:10,313
better than doing it in just plain Java,

25
00:01:10,313 --> 00:01:20,000
so let's go through Java first because that's the most popular, and then the XML section might help solidify any questions you may still have.
