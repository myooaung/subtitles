00:00:00.962 --> 00:00:02.297
What is Spring?

2
00:00:02.297 --> 00:00:07.524
Well, the Spring Framework started out as just an inversion of control container.

3
00:00:07.524 --> 00:00:11.354
This technique is often referred to as dependency injection.

4
00:00:11.354 --> 00:00:14.903
It was conceived to reduce or replace some of the complex

5
00:00:14.903 --> 00:00:18.468
configuration of the earlier Java Enterprise Edition.

6
00:00:18.468 --> 00:00:21.632
Spring was later built around using Java without EJBs,

7
00:00:21.632 --> 00:00:25.492
so its original concept was how to work better with EJBs,

8
00:00:25.492 --> 00:00:29.373
and then they realized they just didn't need those for a lot of situations.

9
00:00:29.373 --> 00:00:31.850
So it kind of transitioned into, okay,

10
00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:37.738
how can I do the same development without using Enterprise JavaBeans?

11
00:00:37.738 --> 00:00:40.425
This course is designed to show you how to use Spring,

12
00:00:40.425 --> 00:00:44.100
and since Spring is a dependency injection container,

13
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.320
we will also discuss why.

14
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.929
Dependency injection is very simply removing hard-coded

15
00:00:48.929 --> 00:00:57.000
wiring in your app and using a framework to inject dependency resources where they are needed.
