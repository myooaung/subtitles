00:00:01,162 --> 00:00:04,047
Web scopes are beyond what we're going to cover in this course

2
00:00:04,047 --> 00:00:07,880
since it's just a basic Spring fundamentals course.

3
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:10,946
They are covered more in the Introduction to Spring MVC

4
00:00:10,946 --> 00:00:12,840
course that's available here on Pluralsight,

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:17,079
and that's simply because we have to set up an entire web application

6
00:00:17,079 --> 00:00:20,270
for you to see how they interact with an object.

7
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:24,248
The three other scopes that are available are the request scope,

8
00:00:24,248 --> 00:00:27,477
which returns a bean per HTTP request,

9
00:00:27,477 --> 00:00:31,407
which sounds a lot like prototype except it's for

10
00:00:31,407 --> 00:00:34,989
the lifecycle of a bean request, which is fairly short,

11
00:00:34,989 --> 00:00:37,843
but longer than prototype where it's one instance per

12
00:00:37,843 --> 00:00:41,037
every time I ask the container for a bean.

13
00:00:41,037 --> 00:00:45,607
The session just returns a single bean per HTTP session,

14
00:00:45,607 --> 00:00:49,592
and that will live as long as that user session is alive,

15
00:00:49,592 --> 00:00:52,383
so 10 minutes, 20 minutes, 30 minutes,

16
00:00:52,383 --> 00:00:56,178
however long they're alive on that website a bean of

17
00:00:56,178 --> 00:00:58,285
scope session will stick around.

18
00:00:58,285 --> 00:01:02,283
And then there is globalSession, which will return a single bean per application,

19
00:01:02,283 --> 00:01:07,463
so once I access it, it's alive for the duration of that application,

20
00:01:07,463 --> 00:01:10,913
not just my visit to that application.

21
00:01:10,913 --> 00:01:13,141
You could think of it as singleton,

22
00:01:13,141 --> 00:01:20,000
but it's really the entire life of that application on the server until it gets undeployed or the server gets rebooted.
