There are five scopes available inside of Spring for us to

2
00:00:06.206 --> 00:00:08.647
configure a bean inside of our application.

3
00:00:08.647 --> 00:00:15.236
Valid in any configuration is a singleton, which is actually the default.

4
00:00:15.236 --> 00:00:17.292
You've most likely heard of a singleton before,

5
00:00:17.292 --> 00:00:21.536
but we're going to explain that a little bit more in detail and what that

6
00:00:21.536 --> 00:00:25.020
means in regards to a Spring application in our next demo.

7
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.982
The other scope, though, is a prototype scope.

8
00:00:29.982 --> 00:00:34.665
Prototype is actually a new bean per request.

9
00:00:34.665 --> 00:00:38.461
You typically do want the singleton over the prototype.

10
00:00:38.461 --> 00:00:42.070
The other configurations that are available for beans that are only

11
00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.901
valid in web-aware Spring projects are request,

12
00:00:47.901 --> 00:00:50.670
session, and global.

13
00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.392
So if you're implementing Spring MVC or even doing a single-page model

14
00:00:55.392 --> 00:00:58.929
application to where you're doing microservices to your front end,

15
00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:07.000
those scopes are only available in that context. Let's look a little bit more at the singleton pattern.
