00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:01,769
In this module,

2
00:00:01,769 --> 00:00:05,368
we showed how to do the similar configuration we had done in the

3
00:00:05,368 --> 00:00:09,464
Java application using the XML configuration.

4
00:00:09,464 --> 00:00:15,278
We created the applicationContext, which was just like our AppConfig.java file.

5
00:00:15,278 --> 00:00:17,197
We showed what a bean definition looked like,

6
00:00:17,197 --> 00:00:21,291
and the bean definition code is very similar to the

7
00:00:21,291 --> 00:00:23,564
@Bean annotations that we used.

8
00:00:23,564 --> 00:00:28,302
We then demonstrated setter injection and constructor injection.

9
00:00:28,302 --> 00:00:31,852
Then we looked at autowiring and actually compared that to the

10
00:00:31,852 --> 00:00:35,159
autowiring that we did in our Java configuration app.

11
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:39,822
We showed the various autowiring methods as well by constructor,

12
00:00:39,822 --> 00:00:42,300
byType, and byName,

13
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,753
and showed you how your application can break using one

14
00:00:45,753 --> 00:00:48,259
approach and succeed using another.

15
00:00:48,259 --> 00:00:55,000
Let's look at some of the more advanced Spring configuration concepts in this next module.
