Hi everyone.

2
00:00:02.592 --> 00:00:09.072
My name is Bryan Hansen.

3
00:00:09.072 --> 00:00:11.617
Welcome to my course, Spring Fundamentals.

4
00:00:11.617 --> 00:00:15.777
I'm the director of software development at Software Technology Group.

5
00:00:15.777 --> 00:00:18.943
The Spring Framework has taken the Java community by storm,

6
00:00:18.943 --> 00:00:23.218
making web and enterprise development much simpler than it previously was.

7
00:00:23.218 --> 00:00:24.916
In this course,

8
00:00:24.916 --> 00:00:26.798
we're going to cover the fundamentals of Spring

9
00:00:26.798 --> 00:00:29.295
development by going through the various configuration

10
00:00:29.295 --> 00:00:32.535
methods that are available inside Spring.

11
00:00:32.535 --> 00:00:37.183
Some of the major topics that we will cover include Java configuration,

12
00:00:37.183 --> 00:00:41.059
autowiring, and advanced bean configuration.

13
00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:42.101
By the end of this course,

14
00:00:42.101 --> 00:00:44.370
you'll know the configuration methods available in

15
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.445
Spring and how they'll benefit your code.

16
00:00:47.445 --> 00:00:50.350
Before beginning the course, you should be familiar with Java,

17
00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.205
but no previous Spring experience is required.

18
00:00:54.205 --> 00:00:54.908
From here,

19
00:00:54.908 --> 00:00:59.414
you should feel comfortable diving into Spring with courses on Spring MVC,

20
00:00:59.414 --> 00:01:03.061
Spring Data JPA, and Spring Security.

21
00:01:03.061 --> 00:01:06.118
I hope you'll join me on this journey to learn the fundamentals of

22
00:01:06.118 --> 00:01:14.000
Spring development with the Spring Fundamentals course, at Pluralsight.
