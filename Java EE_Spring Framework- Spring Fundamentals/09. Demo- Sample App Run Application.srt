1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:04,943
We now have all the pieces of our application built to where we can wire it up,

2
00:00:04,943 --> 00:00:07,752
so let's go ahead and right-click on source,

3
00:00:07,752 --> 00:00:11,544
main, java, and say New, Java Class.

4
00:00:11,544 --> 00:00:15,050
And I am going to use the default package for this.

5
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:20,292
I just want to enter in here Application and click Enter.

6
00:00:20,292 --> 00:00:26,364
And we're going to create a public static void main in

7
00:00:26,364 --> 00:00:30,667
this file and pass in our String args,

8
00:00:30,667 --> 00:00:34,699
our basic Java signature for a main method.

9
00:00:34,699 --> 00:00:43,066
To demonstrate this, we're going to wire up our SpeakerService.

10
00:00:43,066 --> 00:00:49,768
Just call it an instance of service = new SpeakerServiceImpl,

11
00:00:49,768 --> 00:00:57,194
and we will just do a System.out .println,

12
00:00:57,194 --> 00:01:01,416
a basic happy path testing if you've never heard that term before.

13
00:01:01,416 --> 00:01:03,406
We're going to just test that our application works

14
00:01:03,406 --> 00:01:04,948
exactly how we think it should,

15
00:01:04,948 --> 00:01:14,969
and we'll say service.findAll .get (0) .getFirstName now.

16
00:01:14,969 --> 00:01:21,658
In my instance, I used my name, so this should, when we run it, print out Bryan.

17
00:01:21,658 --> 00:01:26,711
I'm going to go ahead and right-click on main and say Run Application.main.

18
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:29,970
You'll see it compile here in our build window,

19
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:34,497
and you'll see that it printed out Bryan down below here.

20
00:01:34,497 --> 00:01:38,899
Now if you get an error here saying that it was compiled with Java 11,

21
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:43,118
but ran with Java 5, and that's not supported,

22
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:47,532
it's because you need to go back into the POM and add that

23
00:01:47,532 --> 00:01:50,038
build section that we talked about earlier.

24
00:01:50,038 --> 00:01:52,052
I've seen a lot of people miss that step,

25
00:01:52,052 --> 00:01:53,939
so make sure you've added that in there.

26
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:55,479
Let's walk through everything that we did here really

27
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:57,190
quick and what our application did.

28
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:59,908
So we create an instance of SpeakerService,

29
00:01:59,908 --> 00:02:01,837
it goes to our SpeakerServiceImpl,

30
00:02:01,837 --> 00:02:05,834
so our interface is going to our implementation.

31
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:09,648
This is going to load our repository tier,

32
00:02:09,648 --> 00:02:12,104
or, in this instance, our fake Hibernate instance,

33
00:02:12,104 --> 00:02:19,635
and go through our SpeakerRepository to that RepositoryImpl where it would

34
00:02:19,635 --> 00:02:25,298
simulate us calling a database and returning a list of speakers.

35
00:02:25,298 --> 00:02:35,000
In this instance, we had Bryan and added that to our list and returned it out. Let's go see how we would now configure all of that using Spring.
