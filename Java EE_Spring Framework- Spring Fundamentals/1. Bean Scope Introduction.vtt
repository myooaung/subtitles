00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.818
Now that we've seen some of the basic Spring configuration and overall just

2
00:00:04.818 --> 00:00:08.700
how to create and implement beans inside of our application,

3
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.670
let's go a little deeper and look at Spring scopes and autowiring,

4
00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:17.483
specifically scopes of beans inside of our application.

5
00:00:17.483 --> 00:00:20.140
They're a very important part of the bean lifecycle and will show

6
00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.119
us how to use different things inside of our application and

7
00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.241
implement behaviors regarding beans.

8
00:00:27.241 --> 00:00:33.013
The scopes inside of our application usually are associated with patterns,

9
00:00:33.013 --> 00:00:34.246
but they're not really the same thing.

10
00:00:34.246 --> 00:00:38.271
They go hand in hand, but a scope does not equal a pattern.

11
00:00:38.271 --> 00:00:40.911
Spring implements a lot of patterns for you,

12
00:00:40.911 --> 00:00:44.439
which is good because it helps you avoid a lot of the common mistakes and

13
00:00:44.439 --> 00:00:47.491
pitfalls made when implementing patterns on your own.

14
00:00:47.491 --> 00:00:49.186
And if you aren't familiar with design patterns,

15
00:00:49.186 --> 00:00:52.945
I really recommend watching my design pattern series on

16
00:00:52.945 --> 00:00:56.315
the Java design patterns of behavioral, creational,

17
00:00:56.315 --> 00:00:59.919
and structural patterns here on Pluralsight.

18
00:00:59.919 --> 00:01:08.000
Let's dive a little deeper on the scopes and talk about which scopes are available to your application and which scenarios they tie into.
