00:00:01.233 --> 00:00:05.635
There are a few prerequisites you'll need to do the examples in this course.

2
00:00:05.635 --> 00:00:10.484
I'm using Java 11, and I'm assuming that you already know how to install Java,

3
00:00:10.484 --> 00:00:13.501
so we won't be covering that in this course.

4
00:00:13.501 --> 00:00:16.014
I'm also going to use Maven.

5
00:00:16.014 --> 00:00:18.605
I do have a module at the end where I'm going to show you

6
00:00:18.605 --> 00:00:20.675
how I would use Spring Boot to do this,

7
00:00:20.675 --> 00:00:25.719
but people have requested to have just Spring stand alone by itself.

8
00:00:25.719 --> 00:00:29.926
Spring no longer offers up a way to just download the _____ jars,

9
00:00:29.926 --> 00:00:35.076
and you're forced to use Maven or Gradle to download those dependencies.

10
00:00:35.076 --> 00:00:36.969
There is a Pluralsight course on Maven.

11
00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:41.668
If you have more questions about that, you can research that and follow it.

12
00:00:41.668 --> 00:00:43.988
The next thing you'll need is an IDE.

13
00:00:43.988 --> 00:00:46.836
This is an updated version of the previous course,

14
00:00:46.836 --> 00:00:49.741
and I have chosen to use IntelliJ.

15
00:00:49.741 --> 00:00:53.023
We got feedback that a majority of our users wanted to see

16
00:00:53.023 --> 00:00:57.849
and use the examples within IntelliJ, so we have changed the course to use it.

17
00:00:57.849 --> 00:00:59.417
And, finally, Tomcat.

18
00:00:59.417 --> 00:01:01.934
You won't need this for any of the examples that we're

19
00:01:01.934 --> 00:01:03.628
going to do walking through this course,

20
00:01:03.628 --> 00:01:05.948
but the sample app that I use at the end,

21
00:01:05.948 --> 00:01:08.892
and if you follow along with that, uses Spring Boot.

22
00:01:08.892 --> 00:01:12.090
I will deploy that app to Tomcat as well.

23
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:21.000
So if you have it, great, if you don't, don't sweat it. Mainly, Java 11 and the latest version of IntelliJ will work.
