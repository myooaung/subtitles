1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,087
In this module,

2
00:00:01,087 --> 00:00:06,696
we will walk through the configuration of your Spring app using just Java.

3
00:00:06,696 --> 00:00:09,696
We're going to take that sample application that we created in

4
00:00:09,696 --> 00:00:13,297
the previous module and wire it up using the Java annotations

5
00:00:13,297 --> 00:00:15,805
and Java configuration loader.

6
00:00:15,805 --> 00:00:20,306
Java configuration is the latest and most preferred method available

7
00:00:20,306 --> 00:00:24,013
now in Spring for wiring up your applications.

8
00:00:24,013 --> 00:00:27,296
It was introduced simply because some people don't like mixing XML

9
00:00:27,296 --> 00:00:30,318
and source code together for a configuration.

10
00:00:30,318 --> 00:00:31,780
We're going to take that sample project,

11
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:33,827
wire it up with Java and a few basic annotations

12
00:00:33,827 --> 00:00:36,394
just to show you how this works.

13
00:00:36,394 --> 00:00:41,939
So let's talk about the key point of the Java configuration.

14
00:00:41,939 --> 00:00:46,219
Well, the first thing you'll notice about it is there's no XML.

15
00:00:46,219 --> 00:00:49,023
There's no applicationContext file.

16
00:00:49,023 --> 00:00:52,916
If you've done any Spring development in earlier versions,

17
00:00:52,916 --> 00:00:57,240
you'll have an XML file that contains all of your configuration.

18
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:03,133
With that Java configuration, we have no 
 
 [00:00:59] 
 applicationContext.xml.

19
00:01:03,133 --> 00:01:06,383
We still have a context, it's just not configured in XML.

20
00:01:06,383 --> 00:01:10,152
Earlier Spring development got pushed back for having too much XML,

21
00:01:10,152 --> 00:01:13,897
and all of a sudden people were making jokes about being an

22
00:01:13,897 --> 00:01:17,106
XML developer rather than a Java developer.

23
00:01:17,106 --> 00:01:21,324
Later versions of Spring included namespaces to aid in development,

24
00:01:21,324 --> 00:01:25,297
but developers still wanted less or no XML,

25
00:01:25,297 --> 00:01:28,129
so enter Java configuration.

26
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:30,519
Almost everything in Spring can now be configured

27
00:01:30,519 --> 00:01:33,082
with just pure Java configuration.

28
00:01:33,082 --> 00:01:37,928
This was not necessarily the case when we first started this course,

29
00:01:37,928 --> 00:01:40,242
but since this is an update,

30
00:01:40,242 --> 00:01:48,000
we've moved to showing Java configuration first because everything is available to be configured this way now.
