What is all the hype around the Spring Framework?

2
00:00:03,941 --> 00:00:05,912
Do you already know that you want to learn Spring,

3
00:00:05,912 --> 00:00:07,938
but aren't sure where to start?

4
00:00:07,938 --> 00:00:08,187
Hello.

5
00:00:08,187 --> 00:00:12,813
I'm Bryan Hansen, and welcome to my course on Spring Fundamentals on Pluralsight.

6
00:00:12,813 --> 00:00:15,610
In this course, we're going to be learning about developing with Spring,

7
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:19,188
and we'll use the various configuration methods to illustrate some of

8
00:00:19,188 --> 00:00:22,223
the common problems we often face in development.

9
00:00:22,223 --> 00:00:26,152
We will develop part of an application without Spring and then show how to

10
00:00:26,152 --> 00:00:29,675
configure that part of the application using Java configuration,

11
00:00:29,675 --> 00:00:33,090
XML configuration, and annotations.

12
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:40,000
We will also discuss the lifecycle of Spring and how to use beans in a more appropriate fashion.
