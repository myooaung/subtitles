00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.302
Even though this is an update for this course,

2
00:00:03.302 --> 00:00:08.175
we've decided to add this additional module on Advanced Bean

3
00:00:08.175 --> 00:00:11.328
Configuration to address some questions that people have had

4
00:00:11.328 --> 00:00:13.196
over the lifespan of this course.

5
00:00:13.196 --> 00:00:18.765
This also came at a request from Spring themselves as it's

6
00:00:18.765 --> 00:00:21.987
helping people that are trying to achieve some of the

7
00:00:21.987 --> 00:00:23.292
various Spring certifications.

8
00:00:23.292 --> 00:00:26.744
These are some of the topics that they go over in there and want

9
00:00:26.744 --> 00:00:30.406
to help people by exposing them to them here.

10
00:00:30.406 --> 00:00:32.073
We're going to dive into some of the more edge cases.

11
00:00:32.073 --> 00:00:35.638
We're going to talk specifically about advanced bean

12
00:00:35.638 --> 00:00:39.761
configuration using these various techniques.

13
00:00:39.761 --> 00:00:40.041
First off,

14
00:00:40.041 --> 00:00:45.045
we're going to look at BeanPostProcessors and init methods and how that

15
00:00:45.045 --> 00:00:50.612
ties into the creation of beans and having a hook to have an additional

16
00:00:50.612 --> 00:00:53.742
method that acts kind of as a callback.

17
00:00:53.742 --> 00:00:56.181
Then we're going to look at FactoryBeans.

18
00:00:56.181 --> 00:01:00.487
FactoryBeans are a great way to create a Spring bean

19
00:01:00.487 --> 00:01:02.777
that has static methods inside of it.

20
00:01:02.777 --> 00:01:08.452
We're also going to look at SpEL, or the Spring Expression Language,

21
00:01:08.452 --> 00:01:11.389
and then we'll look at proxies and, finally,

22
00:01:11.389 --> 00:01:12.666
bean profiles.

23
00:01:12.666 --> 00:01:17.862
They're typically used in a DevOps or configuration per

24
00:01:17.862 --> 00:01:20.443
specific environment-type scenario.

25
00:01:20.443 --> 00:01:29.000
Let's start out by looking at BeanPostProcessors and how they can aid us in that callback with building out beans.
