00:00:01,008 --> 00:00:04,872
One of the reasons I originally updated this course was because Spring

2
00:00:04,872 --> 00:00:09,514
quit offering a direct download for the compile jars.

3
00:00:09,514 --> 00:00:10,987
Sure there were ways to obtain it,

4
00:00:10,987 --> 00:00:15,167
but nothing as simple as just clicking a link on their project page.

5
00:00:15,167 --> 00:00:16,292
With some of my other courses,

6
00:00:16,292 --> 00:00:19,193
people had asked that it just focus on one technology and

7
00:00:19,193 --> 00:00:21,516
not use supporting tools such as Maven.

8
00:00:21,516 --> 00:00:25,875
Well, like it or not, Spring wants you to download their tools using Maven.

9
00:00:25,875 --> 00:00:29,684
It will be simple for this course though and candidly any

10
00:00:29,684 --> 00:00:33,093
project of moderate complexity should be using Maven or

11
00:00:33,093 --> 00:00:36,154
Gradle anyway to manage dependencies.

12
00:00:36,154 --> 00:00:39,586
The Maven repo has the source, Javadocs,

13
00:00:39,586 --> 00:00:42,137
and the binaries all available for download.

14
00:00:42,137 --> 00:00:46,561
And one of the main reason Spring wants you to use Maven is because of their

15
00:00:46,561 --> 00:00:51,378
transitive dependencies that are required to run the projects.

16
00:00:51,378 --> 00:00:54,273
Spring Boot could be used to set up your application as well,

17
00:00:54,273 --> 00:00:58,531
but it's much too complex and a black box for trying to

18
00:00:58,531 --> 00:01:01,172
show you just the basic fundamentals of what Spring needs

19
00:01:01,172 --> 00:01:04,003
to run in order how to set it up.

20
00:01:04,003 --> 00:01:05,813
We will set up a Spring Boot application later

21
00:01:05,813 --> 00:01:07,533
though and compare the differences,

22
00:01:07,533 --> 00:01:14,000
but let's get our app configured and use Maven to download those dependencies and wire up our app.
