1
00:00:02,215 --> 00:00:03,580
project structure in place,

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:08,690
we can go ahead and get started adding Java code to our application.

3
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:09,994
To do this, it's quite easy.

4
00:00:09,994 --> 00:00:12,811
All we want to do is navigate down to our source,

5
00:00:12,811 --> 00:00:18,559
main, java folder that Maven created for us when we created our project,

6
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:23,503
and right-click and select New, Java Class.

7
00:00:23,503 --> 00:00:24,714
And at first use,

8
00:00:24,714 --> 00:00:28,269
you may not be aware that you can add a package in here

9
00:00:28,269 --> 00:00:30,029
at the time of creating your class.

10
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:34,672
You do that by fully qualifying the name of the package structure you want.

11
00:00:34,672 --> 00:00:40,968
So I'm going to type in here com.pluralsight .model .Speaker,

12
00:00:40,968 --> 00:00:45,819
and Speaker is a capital S signifying the class name.

13
00:00:45,819 --> 00:00:52,322
When I hit Enter, it'll go ahead and create this object structure for me,

14
00:00:52,322 --> 00:00:56,046
and if you look at your project navigator on the left,

15
00:00:56,046 --> 00:00:59,838
you can see that it created that folder structure modeling the

16
00:00:59,838 --> 00:01:03,124
package structure and the object class name correctly,

17
00:01:03,124 --> 00:01:06,785
and it's also indicated up here on line 1 of our code

18
00:01:06,785 --> 00:01:09,911
with package com.pluralsight .model.

19
00:01:09,911 --> 00:01:13,418
Now we can enter in a couple of member variables in here.

20
00:01:13,418 --> 00:01:20,219
I'm just going to do a private String firstName and a private String lastName.

21
00:01:20,219 --> 00:01:23,977
And once I have those in here,

22
00:01:23,977 --> 00:01:30,086
I'm going to give myself a little extra space and right-click and say Generate,

23
00:01:30,086 --> 00:01:36,537
Getter and Setter, select both of them, and hit OK.

24
00:01:36,537 --> 00:01:42,534
Once I save this, it will compile it into our application, and that's really it.

25
00:01:42,534 --> 00:01:46,405
That's all you need to do to add the model object to your code.

26
00:01:46,405 --> 00:01:47,199
Quite simple.

27
00:01:47,199 --> 00:01:49,982
Again, navigate to source, main, java, right-click,

28
00:01:49,982 --> 00:01:53,472
fully qualify the package name and the class name.

29
00:01:53,472 --> 00:01:55,972
It'll create our speaker object for us,

30
00:01:55,972 --> 00:01:59,914
and then we'll enter our member variables and generate our getters and setters.

31
00:01:59,914 --> 00:02:00,870
Now that this is in place,

32
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:07,000
let's go ahead and add our repository object to our class structure as well. The next piece of the
