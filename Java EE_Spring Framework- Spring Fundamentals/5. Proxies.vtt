Spring often utilizes AOP proxies for its code base.

2
00:00:05.161 --> 00:00:09.433
Proxies are a great way to inject behavior into the code

3
00:00:09.433 --> 00:00:12.958
base without modifying the underlying code.

4
00:00:12.958 --> 00:00:15.016
In the code snippet that you see on the slide,

5
00:00:15.016 --> 00:00:18.574
this simple POJO is the class that we want to proxy to,

6
00:00:18.574 --> 00:00:22.610
and the POJO is the interface that we will make calls on through

7
00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.499
the proxy and allow the calls to be intercepted.

8
00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:27.360
To be honest,

9
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.504
this isn't something that the average developer typically needs to work with,

10
00:00:31.504 --> 00:00:34.617
but it's a good thing to know.

11
00:00:34.617 --> 00:00:35.844
When should you use this?

12
00:00:35.844 --> 00:00:39.135
Well, you probably shouldn't be looking for opportunities to use it.

13
00:00:39.135 --> 00:00:43.831
It's usually when you are doing something framework or library based.

14
00:00:43.831 --> 00:00:47.100
One of the most used cases in the code base is when dealing with

15
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.873
databases and using the annotation @Transactional.

16
00:00:50.873 --> 00:00:54.340
The @Transactional annotation is used to be the starting point

17
00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.832
of your code base in which you would like the following code to

18
00:00:57.832 --> 00:01:00.253
be surrounded with the transaction.

19
00:01:00.253 --> 00:01:03.598
Writing one is really beyond the scope of this course,

20
00:01:03.598 --> 00:01:04.169
in fact,

21
00:01:04.169 --> 00:01:07.228
I think you could have a whole course on proxies and

22
00:01:07.228 --> 00:01:08.778
the best way to implement them,

23
00:01:08.778 --> 00:01:11.932
but I wanted to show you what they are and point out that

24
00:01:11.932 --> 00:01:20.000
they are used often in the Spring code base. Let's look at one last concept and that's bean profiles.
