00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.740
Remember URL see Vasquez iCloud architect and you have a job to do.

3
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.020
Your boss has asked you to set up a development environment for the

4
00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:16.920
developers to use to get a taste for how things work in a W s.

5
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.900
To that end, you're gonna be using the U.

6
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:19.230
S.

7
00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:25.060
East one region and use to availability zones within that region For

8
00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:31.140
your VPC you're going to create the Dev Dash vpc and then within that

9
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.740
VPC you're going to create to public facing sub nets and to sub nets

10
00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:42.200
for database services because at some point you will be hosting RDS in

11
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.040
this development.

12
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:48.440
VPC So that's what we're going to set up in our initial configuration.

13
00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.260
All right, it is demo time within the demo,

14
00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.550
we are first going to examine our ______ form files and see

15
00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.440
what's going on for this demonstration.

16
00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.000
Then we're going to deploy the configuration to a W S and review the results.

17
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.470
Now you may want to play along and that is awesome.

18
00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.840
You're going to need a few things over the body of this course.

19
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:12.650
The first thing is,

20
00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:17.480
you're going to need to A W s accounts not for this demo specifically,

21
00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.750
but within the larger context of the course,

22
00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.120
there are a few demos that require two separate accounts.

23
00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.230
One's gonna be basically the security account,

24
00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:29.840
and we'll see how that works in a later module.

25
00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.360
You're also going to need full admin access to your AWS accounts.

26
00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.550
So if you were thinking about using your work A W s account or

27
00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.870
something like that ID recommend against it,

28
00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:46.040
you should probably spin up a set of AWS accounts specifically for this course.

29
00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.150
You'll also want to have the A W s CLI installed.

30
00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.140
And it doesn't matter if you're running on Mac or Windows or Linux.

31
00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.240
Any of those is find.

32
00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.680
You just wanna have the CLI installed.

33
00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.980
And finally you'll need terra form installed and the exercise files,

34
00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.560
which you can always find on my GitHub.

35
00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.940
It's Ned 13 13 and then just look for the course name in my repositories.

36
00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.840
Okay, with that out of the way, I do have one last disclaimer.

37
00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.730
Some of the resources that you deploy in a ws may cost money.

38
00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.260
Consider yourself duly warned.

39
00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.640
I have done my absolute best to use resources that

40
00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.440
cost zero or very little money,

41
00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.360
but once you're done working through a configuration,

42
00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.640
it's probably best if you delete it.

43
00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:38.000
With that being said, Let's go over to visual studio code and take a look at the configuration.
