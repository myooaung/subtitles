[Autogenerated] Hey, everybody, this is Ned Bellavance,

2
00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.100
and welcome to my course, implementing Terra Form on A W s.

3
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:08.430
In this first module,

4
00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.620
we're going to dive straight into things by talking about

5
00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:16.170
using the AWS provider in this module.

6
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.030
Where first going to go over course prerequsites.

7
00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:21.460
What should you know before you start this course?

8
00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.440
Because there are a few things a few assumptions that I'm making here.

9
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.080
Then we're going to talk about the differences and

10
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.530
similarities between CloudFormation.

11
00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:35.630
The infrastructure is code that you would use an AWS by default and terra

12
00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.040
form the tool that you're going to be learning about.

13
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.420
We'll introduce a scenario using Globomantics that will serve as the underlay

14
00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.940
for the rest of the course as we go through various demos.

15
00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.110
And then finally, we'll get into meat of things the A.

16
00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:54.840
W s provider, how to use it and how to authenticate against it.

17
00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.080
All right, But first, let's get into those prerequsites.

18
00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.740
Shall we?

19
00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:03.700
I really only expect you to know two things going into this course.

20
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.520
The first one is knowing the terra form basics.

21
00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.580
Either you've been working with terra form a little bit on your

22
00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.080
own or you've gone through my other course,

23
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.820
terra form getting started.

24
00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.940
Either of those gives you a good day.

25
00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.140
Baseline on where you should be with your terra form skills.

26
00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.140
So I'm not going to spend a bunch of time explaining the

27
00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.010
syntax and the code in the examples,

28
00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.790
except where it's applicable to how it works with a W s.

29
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.610
The other prerequsites is some understanding off AWS and its core constructs.

30
00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.970
I'm not expecting you to be a wizard with Lambda or no,

31
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.930
the latest things about green grass or some other technology,

32
00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.950
but you should know the fundamentals.

33
00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:46.200
What's a VPC?

34
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.010
What is identity and access management and a little

35
00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:50.830
bit about how those things work.

36
00:01:50.830 --> 00:02:00.000
Otherwise, this is gonna be quite confusing with that. Out of the way, let's compare and contrast CloudFormation and terra form.
