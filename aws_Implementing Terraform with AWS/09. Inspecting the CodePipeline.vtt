00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:01.310
[Autogenerated] Alright,

2
00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:03.710
we're back in the console and we want to look at

3
00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:05.230
what's going on with our pipeline.

4
00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:08.840
So let's go ahead and expand pipelines and go to pipelines.

5
00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:13.340
There we go and we have our VPC deploy pipeline and oh my goodness,

6
00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:14.490
it already succeeded.

7
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.460
And that's because when we pushed are committed code up to the code commit

8
00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:24.290
repository that kicked off a new pipeline run and it was able to

9
00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:26.840
successfully do everything that's in that pipeline.

10
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.940
So why don't we just go ahead and look at what's in the pipeline?

11
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.770
It lines up to what you saw in the graphic earlier.

12
00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.360
We've got our source stage and it has a single action in there called Source,

13
00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.710
and all source does is pull that code from code commit so it

14
00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.840
can use it for the remainder of the stages.

15
00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:44.950
We scroll down a little bit.

16
00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.210
Here we get into the development portion of things and you

17
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.020
can see there's two actions in here.

18
00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.560
We saw that in the graphic as well.

19
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.540
There's plan and then there's apply,

20
00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.860
and it would probably be useful to see what's actually in these two actions.

21
00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:06.530
So let's go ahead and click on edit here and we will click on edit stage.

22
00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.400
So we can edit these actions and then we'll go ahead

23
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.200
and click on edit action here.

24
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.930
So we can see what's actually in here so we could see the action is called Plan.

25
00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:18.290
The provider is CodeBuild.

26
00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.940
So we're using CodeBuild to execute an action.

27
00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:27.060
And if we scroll down we can see the at the project name is VPC Deploy Project.

28
00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.580
So that's the CodeBuild project that we want to use and then

29
00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.540
we're gonna override some environment variables were

30
00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.970
overriding the TF action to be plan, which it actually is by default.

31
00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:38.980
But that doesn't matter.

32
00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:42.260
We're specifying plan here and then we're overriding

33
00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.000
three workspace name to be development.

34
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.240
So we're telling it, we want to plan our development deployment.

35
00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.300
So that's everything that's in this one.

36
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.240
We can cancel out of here and take a look at apply.

37
00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.790
What does apply, do apply has the same information.

38
00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.460
But if we scroll down to our environment variables,

39
00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.660
RTF action is apply and we're using the same workspace development.

40
00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:12.420
If plan runs successfully, it will move to the action of apply and if apply,

41
00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.310
run successfully.

42
00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.930
Then this entire stage ran successfully so we can cancel

43
00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.820
out of here and cancel out of here.

44
00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:23.550
We don't actually want to change anything and cancel out of here.

45
00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:24.310
Discard.

46
00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.690
I didn't make any changes and we could see it did executable e.

47
00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:34.440
If we go into services and take a look at our current VP CSS,

48
00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.380
we'll open that a new tab so we don't lose where we are in our

49
00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:44.470
code pipeline process we can now see under VP CSS we can Now see

50
00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.510
if I expand out the name a little bit.

51
00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.900
We have a vpc called development cache vpc.

52
00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.150
And if we look at the tags here under environment,

53
00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.420
its development So we successfully committed files to code commit,

54
00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.930
had CodeBuild deploy our environment and automated the

55
00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.140
whole process through our code pipeline.

56
00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.090
But wait,

57
00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.870
there's more because Globomantics doesn't just want

58
00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:13.000
to deploy through development. They'd also like to deploy through you 80 and production
