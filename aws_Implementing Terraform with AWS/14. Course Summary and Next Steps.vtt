00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:03.620
[Autogenerated] all right, that is going to wrap up this course.

2
00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:04.100
First of all,

3
00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.380
I want to say thank you for staying the course with me

4
00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:08.440
and making it all the way through.

5
00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:13.440
Let's summarize some key takeaways from the course at large.

6
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.140
One of the things that we saw is when you create

7
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.660
multiple instances oven A W s provider.

8
00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.760
There's two primary reasons to do that.

9
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.490
One is because you're dealing with multiple accounts and the other

10
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.030
is because you're dealing with multiple regions,

11
00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:29.340
so I hope I hammer that point home pretty well.

12
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.140
The other thing we saw about the provider is there's many

13
00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.630
different ways to authenticate to the provider.

14
00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:37.660
You can use profiles that are in your credentials file.

15
00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.760
You can use instantiate profiles that are associated with the E C

16
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.590
two instantiate or container running in A W S.

17
00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.920
Or you can just use straight up access keys and secret keys stored.

18
00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.240
An environment variables.

19
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.440
There's a lot of options there.

20
00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.970
We also saw how you could store state remotely in S3 and dynamodb

21
00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.260
and how that's really the general recommendation.

22
00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.700
Once you get beyond doing some simple development things with terra form,

23
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.940
get that state off of your local Docker and into something remote.

24
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.340
And then finally, we use source control, too.

25
00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.930
Store are configurations and we used automation through CodeBuild and

26
00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.740
code pipeline to deploy what was in source control.

27
00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.470
Source control is awesome.

28
00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.800
I use it every time I set up a new project.

29
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.390
I highly recommend that you open up a GitHub account if you

30
00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.590
don't really have one and do the same.

31
00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.970
And I think code pipeline and CodeBuild are really useful tools in the AWS

32
00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.640
code family for automating your infrastructure deployments.

33
00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:37.870
Now, if you're wondering what's next,

34
00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:41.040
what should you get started with beyond this course?

35
00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.840
Well, I have a couple of recommendations here.

36
00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.160
The first is to look at the other resources that are available through

37
00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.890
the AWS provider and just tinker around with them,

38
00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.800
find something that interests you and figure out how to

39
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.430
deploy the best way to learn terra form.

40
00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.980
And working with Terra forming a W S is to just do it to mess around,

41
00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.040
break things and then try again.

42
00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.360
Try not to cost yourself too much money, but otherwise have fun.

43
00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:06.600
It's absolutely worth it.

44
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.990
Thea.

45
00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.630
Other thing that I would highly recommend is there's now a ______ form

46
00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.140
certified associate certification available from Hashish Corp.

47
00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.640
There's a study guide associated with it.

48
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.550
If you've gotten through this course successfully,

49
00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.000
you're probably at the point where you're ready to get Terra form certified.

50
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.140
So go out and get that certification once again.

51
00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.170
Thank you so much for watching the course and spending the time with me.

52
00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:30.540
I value your feedback.

53
00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.660
Hit me up in the discussions or on Twitter.

54
00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:39.000
I'm Ned 13 13 and let me know how you did with the course. Thanks, everybody.
