00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:04,730
[Autogenerated] Let's go ahead and open up the commands dot txt file and will

2
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:07,840
run through the process of deploying this configuration.

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:10,190
Now, just like any terra form configuration,

4
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:13,260
our first thing to do is run terra form in it.

5
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:15,680
But first I've got to get in The right directory.

6
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:18,080
Wouldn't work too well if I wasn't All right.

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,840
Let's go ahead and run Terra form in it,

8
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:26,460
and this will download the module and provider executable.

9
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,670
That should happen fairly quickly.

10
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:31,930
The next thing we're going to do is run ______ form plan.

11
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:37,630
Dash out vpc dot t f plan and so we'll just create an execution

12
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:42,140
plan for the creation of these two VP CSS.

13
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:44,070
Let's go ahead and let that run.

14
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:47,190
It's going to be creating a lot of resources because it's

15
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:58,240
too full VP CSS into separate regions.

16
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,570
Wow, that's a lot of stuff.

17
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:02,330
It's going to add 30 new resources.

18
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:07,540
So 15 in US East one and 15 in US West one.

19
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:12,040
All right, let's go ahead and run the Terra form apply.

20
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:16,030
Go ahead and copy that and paste it down here and now it's

21
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:19,140
going to go ahead and create those resources.

22
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,540
We don't have to wait for it to create all those resources.

23
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:26,840
We can, go over to the console and see those resources created in real time.

24
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:34,740
Okay, here we are in the AWS console, and I'm going to go into VPC s here.

25
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:38,430
And as you can see in the North Virginia, which is the U.

26
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:38,680
S.

27
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:46,240
East one region for AWS, we now have a prod dash V P C Dash East VPC created.

28
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,460
Now if we go ahead and hit the drop-down here and go to us West one,

29
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:57,140
which is Northern California we can see the at Prod

30
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:59,830
Dash v P C Dash West has been created.

31
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:04,080
So we've successfully used two different instances of the AWS

32
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:07,440
provider to create resources in two different regions.

33
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,940
That's one way of doing it.

34
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:15,000
Let's look at a different scenario where we're going to use to different AWS accounts.
