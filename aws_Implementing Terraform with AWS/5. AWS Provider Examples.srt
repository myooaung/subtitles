1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:03,540
[Autogenerated] a typical A W s provider.

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:06,550
Configuration block starts with the keyword provider.

3
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:08,430
That's how you know you're defining a provider.

4
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:12,780
And then the name label tells terra form what type of provider you're creating.

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,540
In this case, it's an A W s provider.

6
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:20,440
Within this configuration block are a number of arguments and values.

7
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:21,800
A common one is version.

8
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,130
And I mentioned this earlier that you might want to

9
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:25,760
set the version for your provider.

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,520
So when a new major version release comes out,

11
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:31,740
it doesn't break your configuration.

12
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,120
Another common argument is Alias.

13
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,500
If you're going to have multiple instances,

14
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,820
oven A W s provider in your configuration using

15
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:42,840
aliases is how you differentiate them.

16
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,480
The A W s provider is also region specific.

17
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,240
So you have to tell it which region it's going to be working with.

18
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,650
And then for authentication.

19
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:56,140
You could explicitly state the access key and secret key

20
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:58,240
and submit them through variables.

21
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:01,360
So that's one way that you could use this provider.

22
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,940
We'll see other examples as we get into the demos.

23
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:09,040
Now I mentioned environment variables, so let's see how those work.

24
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,960
There are a bunch of different environment variables

25
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:15,040
that you can use with the AWS provider.

26
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:20,660
Two of the obvious ones are AWS access key IDE and A W s Secret access key.

27
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:23,840
And that's basically your access key and secret key.

28
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,230
If you set these environment variables,

29
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:28,050
terra form will find them and then you don't have to

30
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:31,340
explicitly set them in your configuration.

31
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:33,900
Another one is the AWS shared credentials file,

32
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,930
and this is simply the location of the credentials file,

33
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:41,740
which is useful if you're storing it in a non default location.

34
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:45,730
You can also specify which a W s profile you want to use

35
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:49,390
in that credentials file by setting the AWS underscore

36
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:52,140
profile environment variable.

37
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:56,540
If you have a default region you like to use, you can set a W s default region.

38
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:58,300
And if you don't specify the region,

39
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:01,540
terra form will use whatever value is in there.

40
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:05,960
If you have m f A set up and you're using session tokens for authentication,

41
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:10,540
you can set the session token through an environment variable as well.

42
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:14,190
So those are a bunch of different environment variables you can use

43
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:17,860
as part of your authentication process with the A.

44
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:24,000
W s provider. Now let's take a look at what's going on at Globomantics
