[Autogenerated] When you first start your deployments with terra form in a W s,

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,700
you're probably not walking into a green field type situation.

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:09,700
There's probably existing deployments,

4
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:13,700
or at least existing practices that are happening in your organization,

5
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:16,380
and you need to integrate terra form with those

6
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:19,040
existing practices and resources.

7
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:21,510
That's what we're going to be dealing with in this module.

8
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:22,130
Hey, everyone,

9
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:24,830
this is Ned Bellavance and let's get into using data

10
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:28,440
sources and CloudFormation templates.

11
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,630
All right, what are we gonna cover in this module?

12
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:30,860
Well,

13
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:35,230
the first thing I want to do is take a step back and we are going to

14
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:39,600
talk about infrastructure is code and how you should layer your

15
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,820
configurations when you're building out.

16
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:43,220
This infrastructure is code.

17
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:45,220
It's not specific to terra form.

18
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:47,830
It's more oven architectural discussion,

19
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:51,030
but I think it's important in the context of how you're going to

20
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:55,940
integrate terra form with your existing AWS environment.

21
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:58,690
Then we'll talk about an important aspect of that

22
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:01,130
which is consuming data sources.

23
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:05,240
You're going to have existing data sources in a W S.

24
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:08,690
How do you consume the information in those data sources

25
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:11,680
to use them in your tariff arm configuration It's

26
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,630
something that we've already seen,

27
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:16,340
but we're going to delve a little bit more into it.

28
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:19,230
And then finally, the sounds a little counterintuitive,

29
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:22,260
but we're gonna look at how you can use CloudFormation

30
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:25,610
templates in your ______ form configuration and,

31
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:26,730
like, mind blown.

32
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:27,990
Why would you even do that?

33
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:31,110
We'll dive into why you might actually want to do that

34
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:39,000
a little bit later in this module. But first, let's talk about the concept of layering configurations.
