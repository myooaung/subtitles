00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:03,550
[Autogenerated] if you'll remember from our previous module.

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:07,130
The security team at Globomantics is a little bit concerned

3
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:10,110
about being able to inspect and use their security

4
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:13,150
applications within the context of A W S.

5
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:17,340
And the person that's responsible for security is JSON Gibson.

6
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,340
Now, what is he planning to do to accomplish their goals?

7
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:20,520
Well,

8
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,530
the first thing he wants to do is create a separate security

9
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:27,820
account in A W s specifically for security services and then limit

10
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:30,000
everyone else's access to that account.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,840
That's smart thinking, Josh.

12
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,370
Now, within that security account,

13
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:36,430
he is going to create a security VPC where he deploys

14
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:38,400
all his mysterious security tools.

15
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,340
And we don't need to know what those are.

16
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,130
We just need to know they exist now.

17
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:47,350
His plan is to Pierre that security vpc with all of

18
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:49,880
the other vpc s that are out there.

19
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,360
So when a new VPC is created,

20
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:56,630
he wants that vpc to be peered with the security vpc so his

21
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:59,240
security tools can get their hooks in.

22
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:03,040
That's the plan, and he wants our help to make it a reality.

23
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:06,060
How is Elsie Vasquez going to help out with that?

24
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,150
Let's take a look all right.

25
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:09,960
As Elsie Vasquez,

26
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:16,970
we now need to take our dev account where we've created our Dev vpc and

27
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:20,810
Pierre that up with the security VPC in the security count.

28
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:25,280
Except Elsie doesn't have access to the security account.

29
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,970
How is she going to get permissions to accept the

30
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:30,330
peering connection over on that security?

31
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:32,500
VPC Good question.

32
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:33,920
There is a way to do this.

33
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,960
And the way to create that peering connection is through creating a peering

34
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,050
role and giving her account access to that peering role.

35
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:44,240
How do we do that?

36
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,890
If you've worked with I am before,

37
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:49,460
you'll know we can do this by creating a policy and

38
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:51,340
a role in the security account.

39
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:53,450
First will create that peering policy,

40
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:57,410
which basically says you're allowed to describe the peering connections and

41
00:01:57,410 --> 00:02:02,040
then accept a pending peering connection from another VPC.

42
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:05,900
And then we'll create a role and assign that policy to the role.

43
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:08,630
So if someone assumes that peering role,

44
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:11,150
they will get the permissions defined in the peering

45
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:14,290
policy over in the development account.

46
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:19,270
We're going to create a policy that allows users in the Dev account to

47
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:23,240
assume the peering role in the security account,

48
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:28,060
and then we're going to assign that policy to a peering group.

49
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:32,070
So we can basically add individuals to that peering group,

50
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:36,140
and they will get the permissions to create that peering connection.

51
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:39,980
So that's the overall goal of what we're trying to accomplish this.

52
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:42,710
So first we're going to have to create all these

53
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:45,200
different roles and groups and policies.

54
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,080
And then we're going to create the security vpc and then

55
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,440
finally create these actual peering connection.

56
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:55,810
So let's go ahead and get started by creating all these groups,

57
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:57,650
policies and roles.

58
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:58,560
And we're going to do that.

59
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:04,000
You guessed it. Using terra form, let's go over to visual studio code.
