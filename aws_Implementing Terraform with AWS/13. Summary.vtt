00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:01.930
[Autogenerated] all right.

2
00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:03.810
We went through a lot in this module.

3
00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.840
Let's just sum up what we learned.

4
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:11.100
The first thing and this is important from a high level from an architectural

5
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.340
level is that you really need to consider your architecture.

6
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:14.940
Er,

7
00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.680
how you want to layer configurations and the

8
00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.710
interdependencies between those configurations.

9
00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.680
Ideally, you want to keep them loosely coupled,

10
00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.570
and each configuration should be its own atomic unit

11
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.430
outside of the other configurations,

12
00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.340
meaning If I want to swap out one of the configurations with something new,

13
00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:38.040
I shouldn't have to drastically alter all of my other configurations.

14
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.830
It's a software concept that is trickling into

15
00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.890
infrastructure design because infrastructure is starting to

16
00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.800
adopt software development principles.

17
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.940
So it all kind of makes sense.

18
00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.370
The other important thing that we learned in this process

19
00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.320
is that CloudFormation is an option.

20
00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:58.270
You can create stacks from terra form as well as consume the output of

21
00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:01.860
existing stacks into your terra form configuration.

22
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.200
So we know we're not working in a green field here.

23
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:09.000
We're gonna have to deal with what's already deployed. This gives you some options
