00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
there are certain resources that we want only admit to access,

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.750
and there are certain resources that we want every user to access.

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:10.320
For example,

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.150
we want everyone to access the log in page or registration page,

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.050
and we don't want any authentication in that case.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:23.350
And we don't want any user to be able to see list off users available and manage them.

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:26.180
That belongs to only admits,

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.190
so we can add a security tool in this manner.

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:34.850
We can override the configure method.

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.350
We had already talked about this in our Prince Security chapter.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:39.580
So in here,

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:44.460
what I'm trying to do is we want the request.

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.630
With the falling you are baton must only be accessed by a user with the admin drawer.

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:52.380
Do take note.

00:00:52.380 --> 00:01:01.570
That wouldn't say roll underscore admin because this particular string role will be upended

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:02.480
by spring.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.550
We don't have to do that,

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:11.320
and we're also saying that all the content that is available in the static folder as the

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:19.810
last the Web jars This is where the bootstrap libraries are present and registration and

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:27.540
Edmund Registration should be accessible to all the users who visits the website and the

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:34.300
user with the golds user and Edmund must be able to access all the rest of the resources,

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:41.020
and that's how we have restrictions on who can access more hope it makes sense.
