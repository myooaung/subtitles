00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.680
If it is,

00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:02.080
Edmund Ho just logs in.

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:05.550
Then that man must be able to manage the users.

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:07.090
And in our case,

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:10.820
we're just providing the functionality off the leading the user.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:11.490
A steak.

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:12.370
Look at the corn.

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:15.250
Once the admin registers,

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:20.400
we're trying to read at it to list users.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.650
So the request would end up in here,

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.850
and he was just populating the model.

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:35.750
Attribute what list off users available in the database and trying to render this view.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:43.450
And inside here we're using a forage construct A J s steel dag to sort off,

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.650
loop through and populate all the users.

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:50.200
We also have a delete button associated with each user,

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.750
just as with Trudeau's and once the admin place that delayed button,

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.350
the call would go here.

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.750
We're trying to date a user by unidentified air,

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:08.990
but one thing that you should note is that you go to this implementation when you're trying

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:10.110
to delete a user,

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.980
you must also take care of dilating the user's to do list.

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:19.750
It doesn't make sense to keep that to the list when their corresponding user is not present

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:19.750
.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.360
So for that reason,

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:29.360
have created equity method inside the to do service that would delete all the list of

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.450
entries associated with a given user name.

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:42.050
So once off tried to let this user and I tried to log God that particles that can no longer

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:49.010
be able to log in because he's no longer present dilated by admin,

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:51.550
I hope it makes sense.
