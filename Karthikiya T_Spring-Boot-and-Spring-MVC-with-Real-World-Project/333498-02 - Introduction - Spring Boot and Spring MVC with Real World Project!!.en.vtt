00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.110
Welcome to my course on Spring MBC with spring boot.

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:10.950
This course will cover all the spring modules that changed to learn in order to create and

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.620
to and spring applications.

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.330
So this course will cover a lot Offspring,

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:16.490
embassy concepts,

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:18.750
spring boot spring data,

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.720
JP a spring security view technologies,

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:23.850
etcetera.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.700
Before we dive into understanding what this course has to offer,

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.880
let me quickly introduce myself.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:30.500
Justin gets,

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:31.540
If you're curious.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.210
I worked as a senior software engineer,

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:39.080
technical lead technology analyst in various multinational corporations,

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.160
major Lynn toe banking,

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.340
telecom and financial services.

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:49.500
I have over a decade of experience in the industry and to the most part of logged on Java

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.060
and related technologies.

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.560
So that's close to $30,000 off total experience,

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:55.040
which is,

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.400
by the way,

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.650
not so significant.

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:57.250
I mean,

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.580
if you work on something for well over 14 years,

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.290
he will hit that mark easily.

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:05.540
I'm also mentoring projects and been training professionals worldwide.

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.990
But my true passion has always been teaching,

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:10.830
and in all honesty,

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.190
I really hate talking about my achievements.

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:18.150
What matters to me the most is when I give you the results you're looking for with my

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:24.280
teaching here is the high level overview of what will cover in this course Initially will

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:25.610
start off with some basics.

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.790
Where will cower some prerequisite concepts like understanding traditional embassy

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:31.600
architectural,

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:32.830
spring dependence,

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:33.660
injection,

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:34.600
auto wiring,

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:35.290
etcetera.

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:41.170
This module will basically lay a solid foundation to understand the rest of the modules

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.380
that will discuss in the rest of the course.

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.510
Then we'll jump in tow.

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.310
Spring Embassy concepts where will understand the architecture,

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:50.740
various components,

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.260
interceptors,

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:53.370
annotations,

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:55.660
along with some really nice examples.

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.300
We will then get into spring boot,

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:59.370
which is quite a buzz.

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:00.300
Born our days.

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.900
We will cover pretty much all the features that spring but has to offer,

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.210
including auto configuration started dependencies,

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:09.400
spring initialize,

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.660
er,

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:10.660
actuator,

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:11.450
etcetera.

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:12.640
And then,

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:13.980
with spring Jerry Busy,

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.870
we will explore and understand where this confidence in the modern part of the embassy and

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.870
we will see how we can interact with embedded and extranjera basis using gala visit

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:24.610
templates.

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:25.720
Next,

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.830
we'll explore Spring Data J B.

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:28.050
A,

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.780
which comes with a whole stuff interesting concept.

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:36.430
So we will use the most popular JP implementation like hibernate to interact with the

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:37.250
database.

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.120
I would also cover spring data concepts like really methods.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.810
Various annotations,

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:43.810
pagination,

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:44.470
dynamic,

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:45.730
Cleary's etcetera.

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:51.390
And then we'll get into Spring Security Module and we'll talk about very security features

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:52.440
offered by spring,

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.350
like authentication authorization encoding.

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:01.050
CSR if Attack Key store held up in decoration except Ron.

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:02.750
And after that,

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:08.780
we'll jump into understanding spring boot actuator to access the application metrics,

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:09.960
endpoints,

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.930
etcetera and in tired.

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.900
We're going to see how we can create our own endpoint and customize the metrics,

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.410
and then we'll talk about springboard their tools.

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.000
Here we'll explore some of the features like live,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.530
reload,

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.020
photo restart,

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.430
remote,

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.990
debugging,

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.750
etcetera.

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.390
If you want to take a look at the completely stuff course content,

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.480
you can check the description of this course.

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.990
I understand the significance of having practical knowledge,

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:41.560
so we are actually going to create an end to end application from scratch,

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.730
using all the modules that will learn in the scores.

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:51.990
Our application will have customer log in and admin login registration authorization

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:53.250
authentication.

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:54.980
Your spring there a J p A.

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:56.380
To interact with the database,

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.590
going to use some view technologies,

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:59.670
etcetera.

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:03.150
It's a complete end to an application that we're going to create.

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.750
Here are some other features off this course.

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.950
This course will also touch on prerequisite concepts,

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:16.430
so you don't have to take another course before you're able to understand spring MBC All

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.270
the spring boot is quite a buzz word.

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.920
Nowadays,

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:22.950
there are still countless projects that are using traditional spring framework.

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.000
So keeping those people in mind,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.360
we'll explore old way of doing things.

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.810
And then we'll jump into modern way of doing things using spring vote.

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:35.020
That way you'll be able to work on spring good applications as well.

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.250
Last traditional spring applications.

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:44.330
You get to download all the examples that we're going to see in these videos I have taken

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:45.560
into use in the past,

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.650
and I can certainly help you with industry relevant into your questions.

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:53.800
I keep up building the scores that notes another valuable content.

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.570
So sometimes we may even go beyond the scope of this course and explore more interesting

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:00.170
technologies or topics.

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:01.810
And last but not least,

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:03.760
you'll get lifetime access to this course,

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.760
and even the future update that I bring to this course are absolutely free.

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.750
After you finish the course,

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:13.180
you can add all this goes into resume,

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:14.890
you can add spring framework,

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:17.210
Spring boot Spring Security,

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:18.410
spring data,

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:19.260
etcetera,

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.950
which are by the very essential skills in the current market.

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:27.170
You will also confidently answer into your questions on the subject and get into a better

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:27.750
job.

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:32.880
You will also find yourself actually participating in technical discussions to discuss on

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.370
the subject and don't feel like somebody who's left out.

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:40.640
This course is currently priced at $99.

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:43.450
This course is worth more than $19 by the way.

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:44.590
But if you're lucky,

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:45.910
and if your timing is correct,

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:49.720
you may see a limited time offer that lasts only for a few hours.

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:50.360
Well,

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:51.990
if you're one of those lucky ones,

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:54.320
you'll see a significant drop in the price.

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:57.900
It's a perfect opportunity for you to own this course permanently.

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:00.660
You also have started a different policy anyway,

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:01.780
just to enroll.

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:02.450
Try it.

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:05.380
If you don't like it passed for different simple,

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:07.070
so there is no risk at all.

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:08.400
But if you miss the deal,

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.310
you will never get it at a good price.

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:14.320
I'm known for my teaching style.

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:17.200
I try to make complex concepts look simple,

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:22.280
but that doesn't mean that I will carry you on my shoulders like this one is carrying its

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:22.850
babies.

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:24.360
If I do so,

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.450
I'm doing more harm than good.

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:27.750
Instead,

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:30.230
I would let you experience the new territory on your own.

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:31.480
However,

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:33.650
if you fall or if you need support,

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:35.320
I'm always there to help you.

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:36.850
So throughout your journey,

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:37.700
in the scores,

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:41.050
if you come across with any problem or if you're struck,

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:42.720
I'm always there to help you.

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:47.160
I'm only a message of a I'm also open for feedback and suggestions.

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:48.060
For example,

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:50.650
if you feel like adding a new topic into this course,

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:52.200
give me a suggestion.

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:53.350
Have listened to you.

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:58.370
The good thing about me is I listen to you with a genuine intent to help you with your

00:06:58.370 --> 00:06:59.250
objectives,

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:03.310
not where some day you will fly on your own,

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:06.750
where skies only limit without needing my help.
