00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.790
one of the coolest endpoints available in spring actuator is metrics because it is actually

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:08.710
a combination off multiple metrics.

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:11.850
As soon as you head this year old,

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:15.250
you'll be seeing all the list off names,

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.450
and depending on the Metro that you would like to fetch,

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:21.750
you're to use one of these names.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.480
For example.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:32.130
Let's say I would like to take a look at the maximum data basic connections that we can

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:32.950
never have.

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:35.550
So you copy that name,

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.820
make it part of the euro,

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.250
and there you have it,

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.210
So that's maximum off.

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.250
10 connections,

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.920
similarly,

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:58.420
can take a look at the memory used by J V M like so here is the memory in bites,

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:05.880
the Cebu Sage for application,

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.580
and he would have it.

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.450
I don't know how to read this.

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.700
Usually,

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.350
in my experience have never dealt with this raw data.

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:26.490
I always had some kind off a user interface with some graphical representation of all these

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:27.300
metrics.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:33.950
If you want similar user interface than we have toe configure spring Edmon,

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.250
I'll see if we can cover that topic as well,

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:47.450
and definitely it may not make sense for me to walk you through all these list off metrics

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.140
that would only waste your time.

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:57.260
I would encourage you to configure actually in your project in this year old and just

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:58.300
simply play with it.

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:08.150
What's the best way to understand this endpoint and what it has to offer?

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:10.250
Hope it makes sense.
