00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.870
Okay,

00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:04.350
let us take a look at various dependence is required in our project.

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:11.780
And I assume that you have a The created a simple maven project are a project using a

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:12.950
spring tool suit.

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:14.300
In my case,

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.720
I've used spring to a suit to create the springboard project.

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.410
And by default it comes with few dependence is.

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:22.240
But in case,

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.450
if you're using just a maven project,

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:29.580
then you can add this dependency that would enable you to use all the springboard

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.380
functionalities along with this dependency.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:38.200
Also need to take care off having this particular maven plug in to live rich all the

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.550
springboard functionality.

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.750
So once you do that,

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.050
he can no add.

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.510
The dependence is depending on the technologies that you need in your project.

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.900
You no longer have to think dependence is as a library.

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.150
You can think of it as a technology.

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:56.580
I mean,

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:57.460
for instance,

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:58.250
just bad.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:59.450
In this dependency,

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:04.850
spring boat will instruct maven do not only Donald this dependency,

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:11.230
but also the dependence is that this dependency depends on our transitive dependency is so

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:15.980
ultimately Melvin would download all the libraries that you have a need in order to use

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:16.890
spring J.

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:17.160
P.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.350
A.

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:23.580
And we're adding this dependency because we're going to be using hibernate to interact with

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.460
the database.

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:25.530
And in our case,

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.650
we're going to be using an embedded Hester database.

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:35.550
And not to mention that for every spring embassy project you would need this dependency.

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.450
Spring would start a web,

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.940
and if you're performing jana testing,

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.080
then you would need this dependency.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.050
But at the moment,

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.470
we're not all that interested in this module.

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.350
Maybe down the line will be using it.

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:55.620
We also need spring security as we wanted to introduce authentication,

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:03.570
authorization and a lot of other security features and secure justice for testing spring

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:04.940
security applications.

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:05.800
And again,

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.600
this may not be needed at the moment,

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:08.650
but maybe down the line,

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:18.320
we're also going to be needing an embedded Tom gets over and the JSP library specifically j

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:28.170
a steal because we're going to be using some standard tag libraries off Jsp to design our

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.950
view layer.

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:37.220
And we need this particular dependency Jasper,

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.250
in order to compel just be files.

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.860
Along with that,

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.720
we also including some of the dependency,

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.890
is pertaining to the view layer.

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.250
Those are J query and bootstrap.

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.440
I can't mentioned before.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.010
We're going to be using the Bootstrap Library to simplify things for us.

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.910
And that's all.

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:03.070
All the dependencies and these are all the dependence is that we would need in our project

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.070
.

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:06.250
The next thing that we need to do is to start working on our project.
