00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
Okay,

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.100
let us try to understand.

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:11.090
Spring muc Architectural Spring Embassy architecture is nothing different from a

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:12.850
traditional embassy architecture,

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:20.090
but the only difference is we know have so called a front controller or in case offspring,

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.250
that's going to be the dispatch of So let.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.410
So whenever ed Request is sent from the client the extra duper request,

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.950
the Web server will take a look at the Bar XML file,

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:37.950
and it tries to look for a mapping and this time inside of Abdur XML file,

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.860
we don't try to map the you Earl with So Let's,

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.210
but instead would try to map A.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.730
You are with a front controller.

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.760
And in a typical case,

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:54.460
we will write the Ural pattern in such way that all the student requests will end up in the

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:55.450
front controller.

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:01.500
But it is a job of different controller to deter mined the right sole it where it needs to

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.650
send a request to,

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:08.450
and in order for the controller to figure out to would so let to send the request,

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.470
it will consult so called a handler mapping.

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.570
Now this is a class that is part offspring framework,

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:23.860
and we need to explicitly specify the Ural mapping with a so let inside our conflict file.

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.980
But with the recent versions Offspring framework,

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:28.060
you don't have to do that.

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.150
We can just simply use annotations.

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.400
Once we take a look at an example,

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.550
you'll have a better picture on the same.

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:38.670
And once Eric was reached to the soul,

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.010
let sub let will.

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:42.650
Then they'll get the call to model within,

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.390
which will have the business logic in case offspring.

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.750
Those are called services,

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:54.190
and the service layer will make use off Dow objects or did access objects to be able to

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.450
communicate with the database and then finally will get some kind of result.

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.320
And in spring terms,

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.700
we call that result in model,

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:09.120
which is essentially an object that holds a particular data that will be populating to the

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.950
end user.

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.570
There's so little then send of mortal,

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:17.150
along with the view name to the front controller.

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.660
Now,

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:22.790
the key thing do not here is the control is just going to send of you name.

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.620
It does not specify where that view is.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.450
Reciting are the file extension.

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:29.810
For example,

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.140
if we were to call hello World or JSP,

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.550
the view name is just going to be hello world.

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.920
It does not tell the part of that file are the extension which,

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.210
in case off Jsp,

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:43.350
it's going to be door JSP or in case off velocity,

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.250
it's going to be dot William.

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:51.210
So once a soldier it sends a mortal and the view name to the front controller.

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:57.820
It's the responsibility of the front controller to send the mortal object to the desired

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:58.590
view.

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:04.350
But how does the front controller know the location of the view and the file extension?

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:05.600
Well,

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.150
it will take help from the view result over which is again will be configured in the spring

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:11.050
Conflict file.

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.050
And then after that,

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:20.850
the model will be sent to the Have you and then a two like Jasper.

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:27.250
We'll try to convert that JSP file toe unequal and so let and then the Soviet engine.

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.130
We'll try to send the tester deeper response,

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:36.450
using the response object back to the plant and so the usable see some result.

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:43.640
The main advantage off this approach over traditional MBC architecture is that let's say

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.530
that you're using JSP as of your technology,

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:51.100
and now you're trying to switch to a different technology say Apache Velocity.

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.750
Now you don't have to worry about making changes in the solar.

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.410
It's because nowhere in this of let code were hard courting the view technology.

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:03.040
But all you have to do is to make some changes in the view.

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.150
Result will and you're good to go.

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.750
And that's going to save a lot of development effort involved.

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.180
Well,

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.820
you know,

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:14.520
next week we're going to take a look at a simple example,

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.640
basically a simple hello world example there.

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.350
We will have a better picture on what's happening.

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.450
But in order to keep things simple,

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.950
I'm not going to use database just yet.

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:28.760
We're going to be using until this part the control apart.

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.710
But sure enough,

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:31.610
down the line,

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:36.710
we will be using a database in order to create our projects.

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.650
How will see assume
