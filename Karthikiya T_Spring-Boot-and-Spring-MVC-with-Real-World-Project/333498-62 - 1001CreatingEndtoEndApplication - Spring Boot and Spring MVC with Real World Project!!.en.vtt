00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.800
let us talk about the spring application that we're going to create.

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:07.150
Here are the requirements for the same.

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:08.600
Basically,

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:14.050
what we're going to do is we will create a to do application with logging authentication.

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:16.880
And here are the requirements.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.830
So we're gonna have a user registration form where they use the contagious trader as an

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.550
admin or as a customer,

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:28.750
and the fall must have the following validations.

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.790
The text has to be between 6 to 32 characters,

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.920
and we must check to see if the user is already existing.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:37.460
If so,

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.250
then we shouldn't allow the registration.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:45.490
We also check for the password confirmation and also for the empty string.

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:47.480
That's what the decision form.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.000
Similarly,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.950
we have a log in form and use the needs to be authenticated with the log in form.

00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:02.740
So we're gonna have a page which will be displayed the moment somebody visits a website and

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.450
we're going to have a validation in there as well.

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:11.690
Where will check to see whether the user name and password would match or not?

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:12.930
And based on that,

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.010
we need to authenticate.

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.430
And here is a key part.

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.650
We're going to have a to do management.

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:20.550
So once after the logs in,

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:27.240
they must be ableto manage a list off to does so we must be able to display a list off to

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.660
does.

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:28.500
And,

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:28.870
of course,

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:33.450
they must be ableto add it to do the leader to do or updated to do.

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.450
And while adding the to do or while updating,

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:43.650
they must be prompted with the text field along with a date picker.

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:50.600
We're also going to have a use of management section we're in will display all the list off

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.790
users with the delete functionality.

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:00.150
We're also going toe incorporate member roles,

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.080
and in our application,

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.480
we're going tohave an admin role as villains,

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.670
a user role regardless off their role.

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:15.250
Everybody must be able to access these two pages and only admin and the user doors can

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.180
access the to do management.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.150
But not these of management,

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:27.960
and the use of management must be made available only to admin role.

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:34.650
So before we take a look at how on application is going to look like,

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.600
let's talk about various technologies that we're going to be using to develop or

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.910
application on the front,

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.750
and we're going to be using JSP along with the Bootstrap Library.

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:50.270
The Bootstrap library will give us a lot off comfort so that we don't have to type in all

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.350
the styling aspects off our application.

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.700
By just using this library.

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.080
We're going to save a lot off.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.550
Afford required to write JavaScript are cascading style sheets.

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.790
I'll show you how we can use this library.

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.310
And of course,

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.150
we're going to be using spring framework.

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.320
And not to mention that a lot of components involved.

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.450
We have a controller and model a depository,

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:16.650
a Soviets,

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:17.450
etcetera.

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.070
And here are some of the modules which were going to be using.

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:24.110
We're going to obviously need the Web module.

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:31.810
Rosalind need security and a few other dependence is We're also going to be needing a

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:32.570
database,

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:33.920
and in our case,

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.840
we're going to be using Hester database and not to mention that we're going to live with

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.380
the functionality offspring boot in order to create our application.

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:48.250
So let's quickly take a look at our application and get a sense off how it feels like.

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.060
So here is the log.

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.240
Inform the moment you launch your application and you hit this.

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.640
Your local host call an 80 80.

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:03.740
Then user must be prompted with the log in prompt in this manner.

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:06.580
But before you're able to log in,

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.120
you have to register yourself,

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.160
either as a user or a Sen Edmund.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.850
Let's try registering as a user.

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:16.150
So here we have all sorts of validations.

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:17.380
If I enter some text.

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:18.130
Suppose,

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.090
for example,

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:23.210
let's say User,

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:31.750
let me copy it So we have a validation agile,

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.850
testable between 6 to 32 characters.

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:38.650
Let me change this to use a name,

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:45.350
but then I'm going to make sure that there's a password mismatch.

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:57.770
And so we have this particular error message that's made them seem and sign up as a user.

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:59.650
The moment is the signs up.

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:04.300
He must be able to see this dashboard,

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:10.650
and once he clicks this link there be able to see the to do manager.

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:14.190
I want to add it to do so.

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:15.750
It has to be some description.

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:17.650
We don't have certain validations here.

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:20.760
Description shouldn't exceed certain characters,

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:24.050
and it has to have a minimum off 30 characters.

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:29.750
So let me just quickly type in something.

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:35.610
I want to do something today.

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:41.830
Our tomorrow are day after tomorrow.

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:44.550
Whatever you want to write basically.

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:47.950
And then you would choose the target date.

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:51.330
Well,

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:53.760
I really don't want to set it to do like this.

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.000
That's very de motivating,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.590
But But for the time being will let it go.

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:03.600
So here we have it to do similarly can add yet another to do if you wish.

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:11.750
Save has tried to living the to do there you haven't.

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:19.040
You can also updated to do I want to do something today and blah,

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:19.410
blah,

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:19.890
blah,

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:20.650
whatever.

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:25.050
So we're able to edit that to do?

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:26.450
Basically,

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:28.850
we're able to perform all the crowd operations.

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:34.160
Let me long go from here now and try to Okay,

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:35.940
I guess you're not able to see the log out button.

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:37.750
Let me minimize the window.

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:39.680
Let me know.

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.650
Try to register as an admin.

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:44.250
So admin user.

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:52.150
I'm going to use the same string as a password and has an admin.

00:06:52.150 --> 00:07:00.030
He must be able to see the list off users and should be ableto also delete the user If he

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:09.400
wanted to let me log out as an admin and and see if a user would be able to access the list

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:10.150
off users.

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:11.240
Ideally,

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.250
he shouldn't have the permission to do so,

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:28.650
so that's re create an account as a user name and a straight access that link list users.

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:31.550
And there you have a narrow page.

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:35.250
So let's go back.

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:38.460
So that's the basic functionality off this application.

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:43.250
We're going to explore how we're going to create this application from scratch.

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:44.450
Stay tuned.
