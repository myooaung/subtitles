00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.850
Let's take a look at how we can manage studios corresponding to a particular user.

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:05.890
Once these,

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:08.710
the logs in there be able to say this page,

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:14.050
and all it has is a link which would take them toe list off to does.

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:17.150
So it is a page,

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.550
a welcome page with one link,

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:21.060
which,

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:21.750
when clicked,

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:29.150
it would send a request to the server asking for this resource and inside the controller.

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.010
We have a get mapping for that,

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.960
you little Patton,

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.830
and our goal is to fetch list off to ruse,

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.450
associate ID with the current logged in user.

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:52.900
And so we're trying to get the current logged in user by access in the security context and

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:57.980
ultimately were able to retrieve the current logged in user from the context.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:08.180
Once we get the name of the user we're trying to fetch list off to does associated with

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:08.850
that user.

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.950
So let's take a look at did mattered inside the to the service.

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:21.760
So here we're using one of the creative methods available in the total repository,

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.100
and here it is.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:33.240
This would fetch all the to do's associated with the given user name and would written a

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.280
list off to does.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.880
Ultimately,

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.700
the list would end up here,

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.950
which were populating in this particular attribute,

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:47.330
and we're asking spring to populate the following view.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:48.270
The studios,

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.230
which is this but we don't have any to do,

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:52.350
is to be populated,

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.900
and so we won't see anything here.

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.210
So let's add it to do this.

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:07.080
Particular page also has a link that would send a get request to add.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.900
To do so,

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.500
we have to get mapping for at to do.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.950
And we're trying to add a moral attribute,

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.180
which is basically a command object off to do that we wanted to populate,

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.770
and this object is going to store whatever the whatever the date entered by the user.

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:30.050
And this will take us to this page to do door GSP.

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:48.220
And here we have all the form fields that you're seeing in this page once.

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.440
These,

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.450
if it is a form and clicks on save,

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:59.410
it's going to send upholstery quest to the same.

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:00.330
You are basically,

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.060
since we didn't mention since we didn't mention any action in here,

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:13.520
it's going to send the post request with the same your so it would end up in here and our

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.150
goal is to add that to do into the table.

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:17.980
But before that,

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.090
we're trying to do some validation.

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.650
If you notice inside our to do entity,

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.950
we have this validation specified.

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.650
This sanitation is part of the job X package.

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.300
And what we're trying to say is,

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:34.450
whatever the data are,

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:40.450
the string that we're trying to store should have a minimum off 16 characters.

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.950
And with this annotation,

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.850
we're sort of enabling that validation for this particular object.

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:53.080
And in case if there are any others were trying to populate the same page again.

00:03:53.080 --> 00:04:03.300
And we have a narrow field that corresponds to the description field inside the to do class

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.300
.

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:09.050
Essentially,

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:15.450
what this means is if the user enters the description that doesn't exceed minimum off 16

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:16.250
characters,

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:23.650
they would see and ever let me just quickly demonstrate it.

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:28.200
Okay,

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.750
I'm which was the date and save.

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.150
This is what I was talking about.

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:38.250
And in order to provide this particular date choosing capability,

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:42.150
I'm using the bootstrap library for the same.

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.350
And that's what I'm trying to do in here.

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:52.850
Once the user chooses the date as well as ads in some text,

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:57.350
I will try to store this to do object,

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:00.450
which currently has all the user enter data.

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:01.850
Along with that,

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:06.150
we also need to populate the current logged in user with one off the settlement that's

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:06.800
available.

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.520
And finally,

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.050
I'm trying to save the to do,

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:20.520
like so we're calling the same method off to the repository and then trying to say that to

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:21.650
do along with the user.

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:25.330
Finally,

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.510
we're trying to redirect to the distintos page,

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:33.860
which will render list off to loose.

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:36.480
So let me just copy this.

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:40.450
And so this is what I'm talking about,

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:41.990
all right?

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:43.200
Hope it makes sense.
