00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.840
Okay,

00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:05.450
Let us take a look at how we can create a springboard project from scratch their multiple

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:06.630
ways to do so,

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:12.160
but they approach that I'm going to follow in this video is by using so called as spring

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.030
tool suit,

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:17.150
which can be installed as a plug in in your eclipse and Roman.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.610
We're going to explore the other options in coming time.

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:30.880
So go to help a clips marketplace and search for that plug in spring toe suit,

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.400
alternatively condone,

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:39.750
or the zip file from the Internet and install the plug in manually from Eclipse Home

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:40.410
Directory.

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.090
But before you try to install this plug in,

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.570
do make sure that you have the latest version of Eclipse installed,

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.040
get all the updates and keep the software up to date.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.690
In my case is have all that installed.

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.350
This particular plug in it is showing as installed,

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.070
but you go ahead and install it,

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.650
accepting all the prompts.

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:03.350
You can leave everything toe their defaults,

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.800
and once you install this plug in,

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:06.370
by the way,

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:12.850
this pregnancies from the water make sure you don't install any other random plug in that

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.110
you're seeing in here months.

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:16.290
Install that plug in,

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.380
just goto file new,

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.590
go to other and search for spring.

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.200
You should be able to see this spring starter project.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.750
You will not be able to see this unless you install that particular plug in.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.210
If you're familiar with creating maven projects in eclipse,

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.930
I D.

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.400
Then this interface in here Well,

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.890
look very familiar to you.

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:49.260
The first field in here is a your That's where the spring initialize er is reciting.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.450
We're going to talk about it in a while.

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.410
The name is going to be your project name.

00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:01.980
You can give any name off a choice and the type of project management tool.

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:02.980
In my case,

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:03.750
it's maven,

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.110
so I would leave it to default.

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:07.330
If you're using Raedle,

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.310
then you can choose either of these options.

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.120
The packaging part is a little tricky.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.560
If you're coming from Java background without much often exposure to spring boot and cloud

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.450
architecture,

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.350
then you may be tempted to choose who are archive here.

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:25.940
But in our case,

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.150
we're going to be needing jar file.

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:34.770
This jar file in here is different from typical jar fell that were used to when we think

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.040
off a jar file we would think off the tiles bunch of dark class files.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.230
But in this case,

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.980
this is not a simple jar file.

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.050
It's called a fat jar.

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:52.880
It's a world in itself because the fat jar is going to constitute everything to run your

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:53.760
application.

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:59.120
So it's going to constitute all the libraries that your application ever need,

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.470
including the silver's very replication would be running.

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:09.060
So the result in Jar file is something that you can just run with a simple command and you

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.490
would see your Web application running well.

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:12.890
It will make sense in a while,

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:14.220
however,

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.850
if you're not going to use them better silvers.

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:22.050
But you want to deploy your application on an existing Tom kits of are located elsewhere.

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:27.950
Then you can create a war archive and then take care off the throwing it over there.

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:29.450
For now,

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:30.750
just use jar.

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.290
He also can choose the JV,

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:35.440
um,

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.150
language off your choice and my guess.

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.550
I'm going to be using Java.

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.350
I would leave it to default.

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.250
You can also choose the job abortion.

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.750
I'm going to leave this to default for now,

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:51.650
and everything else you're seeing in here is something specific to maven.

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.450
There are such a naming conventions that you need to follow.

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.170
So if you're not ever off heaven,

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:03.050
I would recommend you to type in exactly what was type didn't here.

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:07.230
And after you do,

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.430
so click next here,

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:15.780
he would get to choose so called a starter project dependence is now.

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:20.970
These are little bit different from project dependence is because typical in the maven

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:21.590
project,

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:26.650
you would choose all the set off dependencies or libraries required in your project.

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:27.840
Here,

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.680
you would choose the technologies that you're going to use in your project.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:32.780
For example,

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.850
let's say my application needs a database,

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:37.940
something like post curious cure.

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:39.460
Well,

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.590
you can just simply choose this and spring boot will take care off,

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:48.480
including all the dependence is required to run equity in the state of base.

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:49.050
Or,

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:54.750
if you're using a close service like Amazon Web services,

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.110
then you can choose one off.

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:59.350
These are Microsoft Azure.

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:01.270
You can just one of these,

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:02.050
you know,

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:04.450
case we're going to keep things simple for now.

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:11.350
And I'm just simply going to be needing a Tom gets over to run our application.

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:14.550
And if you simply hold your muscle,

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:14.950
what there,

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:16.690
you can actually see the description.

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:21.000
If you sell it this particular start to dependencies,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:28.720
then you'll get everything in place to start working or building a rest ful Web service are

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:35.570
serving Web content with Spring Embassy are to build arrest service with spring,

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:39.000
and this is exactly what I'm going to be needing.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.750
So this comes with embedded Tomcats over as well.

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:45.450
So there is no need to you installing this.

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:48.720
So was separately again.

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.720
Once we create and run the application,

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:52.870
all these would make perfect sense.

00:05:52.870 --> 00:06:00.710
So you need to hold on to that point and click next in here.

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:05.730
You can actually see the Ural that is being used to send the request to this.

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:06.850
Bring initialize er.

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:11.250
Let's quickly take a look at what's happening in here.

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:12.300
Control.

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:12.900
See,

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:16.150
go to browser and see what's going on there.

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:22.220
So whatever you have done so far using spring tool suit you pretty much through the same

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:23.550
stuff in here as well.

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:25.300
Say what?

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:26.450
Jews At the maybe no,

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:27.040
gradual.

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:33.730
You would choose the language Springboard wash in which we will just simply leave it to

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:36.280
default and then project matter,

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:38.060
data hero,

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:39.550
the Maven coordinates.

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:41.720
What proper naming convention,

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:42.440
and then,

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:43.200
finally,

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:44.180
he would get to choose.

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:49.350
All the dependence is required in your project are for your application.

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:54.310
So here are the list off dependencies are the technologies,

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:57.410
essentially that you get to choose.

00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:05.330
And finally,

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:09.950
after you choose everything you can click this button gendered project,

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:12.160
which will generate a ZIP file,

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:17.910
which you can import it as a maven project inside your Eclipse and Roman.

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:21.650
And that's essentially what's going to happen here as well.

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:28.390
This is a your that is being used to send the request to that server to perform the

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:31.640
initialization process and then get back.

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:39.380
The result as the file which the stool will imported indoor eclipse and Roman and sod off

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:41.390
created project that we can walk on.

00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:45.250
So let's hit finish is going to take a while,

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:49.950
and here we have it.

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:53.510
We just created the spring boat application.

00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:58.650
We do seem to have one ever let's take a look at what's happening in there.

00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:03.670
Well,

00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:05.650
I don't see anything that May to fix.

00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:09.480
I'm assuming that this is shown by mistake anyway,

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:14.600
Let's leave it there and and I'll see you soon and I will see you soon
