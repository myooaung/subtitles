00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.050
we've seen how we can customize our endpoints similarly can also create your own endpoints

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.050
.

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:08.600
I have a funny example here.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:15.590
How we have to do to create our own endpoint is to create a class with sanitation and point

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:17.410
Give it them that into fire.

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.980
This will be identifier to uniquely identify your end point amongst others and optionally

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:29.850
can also said this flag and this tells us whether going toe enable or disable this endpoint

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:30.750
by default.

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.850
In my case of on this end point Toby enabled by default and so I had to set this to true

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:43.290
and inside this method features it doesn't really matter what name that should you but you

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.350
have to use the sanitation read operation.

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.650
So whenever you send a get request to the same point,

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:58.920
this is a method that gets called and inside here I'm just trying to populate a map which

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:07.240
I'm returning from this method which will ultimately end up in Jason format just as you're

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.050
seeing in here.

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:11.180
Similarly,

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.850
we have annotations for performing crowd operations.

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.160
You have right operation delete operation,

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.950
etcetera.

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.250
But like I mentioned before,

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:26.600
brother is not a 11 tool to perform all such operations,

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.930
and so I'm currently restricted.

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:30.010
Only this,

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.390
in my course on Web services,

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.550
have talked about all the various options available.

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.100
And surely,

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.050
in order to dig any for the in actuator concepts,

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.010
you have to have some knowledge on Web service as well.

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:45.590
But this would so fires.

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.550
It was pretty much everything that you need to know about actuator.

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:56.260
And I'm pretty sure that you understood the purpose off actuator and how you can live,

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.490
Reg.

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.550
Its functionality hope it makes sense.
