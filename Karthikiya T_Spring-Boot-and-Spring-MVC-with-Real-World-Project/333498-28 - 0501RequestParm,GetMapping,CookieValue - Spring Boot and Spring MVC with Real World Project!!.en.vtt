00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.350
Let's take a look at few controller annotations.

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:09.050
The reckless Param annotation would help you read The euro Barometer's are the data

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:10.550
submitted using a form,

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:13.390
and he it is how we would use it.

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:18.190
We wanted to take a look at an example of the same in one or four previous videos,

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:19.200
but distinct,

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.360
as if you're curious as to how it's done.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.190
Well,

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.500
haters this index for that you would make this annotation,

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.980
but off the method argument.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.250
In this manner,

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.850
you can see the text that is highlighted in blue.

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:34.450
You can set few attributes for the sanitation as well.

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.800
So in here were saying value as name.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.660
This would correspond to the one of the form fields,

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:49.930
and you can also said the flag required if it is set to true and the data is not provided

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:55.150
by the user and the request won't be processed and the user would be shown and other.

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.360
You can also set the default value.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.740
If you wish intensive,

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.260
the user doesn't enter anything,

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:08.890
then you can assume a default value and finally can map the value to this matter argument

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.770
so that you can now use this name inside your matter and do something with it.

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.520
He also have records,

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:22.930
Heather annotation that would basically let you read one off the coast headers going back

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:23.770
to our example.

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:31.550
Let me just go to the network tab and submit the request.

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.380
And if you click one off these,

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.630
your Children staff request headers,

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.850
and this is what you can read using that annotation.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.190
So inside here,

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.080
I'm trying to read Holst as villains the except language,

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.950
which you can see in here.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.940
And this would come in handy,

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:00.530
especially if you'd like to know,

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.160
declines local and uses language preference.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.650
And you can do something with that inside this logic.

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:18.080
Or if you'd like to read all the list off headers than instead of mapping with a string

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.910
object,

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:25.340
you would map it with Esther dippy headers and inside the method behavior you would just

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:26.650
say has to do.

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:33.330
We had to start to string value map that would generate a map off all the headers in the

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:34.870
form of key value pairs.

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:42.850
If you're storing cookies on the client machine and you'd like to read them,

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.810
you can always do that with the sanitation,

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.620
and this will come in handy,

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.920
especially if you're maintaining it line session.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.950
And most often this would be used to get decision I d.

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:55.770
And that's it.

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:56.290
For now,

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.950
we'll explore more incoming time.
