00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.950
Okay,

00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:02.470
let's talk about moral attribute,

00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:03.290
annotation.

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:05.450
The moment you click on this link,

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:10.990
we send a request to this handler method inside which we're trying to populate.

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:16.950
The model object by adding all these attributes in the form off key value pairs.

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:24.360
And this is the exact data that gets populated inside our form so the user can choose all

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.280
the options required and then click Submit.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.980
However,

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.650
there is another way you can add these annotations.

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:36.860
It's by using the model attributes annotation.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.350
Let me demonstrate to you what I mean.

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.650
So instead of writing this method in this manner,

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:50.760
I'm actually going to right another matter altogether and annotated with at the rate method

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.660
attributes annotation.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:01:00.920
So I would say public wide color.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:11.830
What are the name that you is to give And inside here we're just simply going to return a

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.510
list off string values.

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:27.860
And so now we have to change the rhythm diet and make sure that you had the sanitation more

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:28.860
the latter tribute.

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.650
And just as you have given some name in here,

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.150
which is a key,

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.650
he can provide an attribute.

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:42.100
In this case,

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.340
this is going to be the key and the values.

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.800
Whatever this matter would written in this case,

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.990
we're trying toe return list off string values.

00:01:50.990 --> 00:02:06.080
How you can get it off this seven on relaunch the application and you would see that the

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.800
data still gets populated,

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.730
demean it,

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:14.600
want ages.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:20.920
You can no access this mortal attribute from inside this Control a class for multiple

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:21.630
requests.

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.820
Whereas if you define your attribute by using this method,

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:30.750
you cannot do so Let me quickly demonstrate the same as well.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:40.910
So from inside this method I'm going to use a mortal map object to be able to read all the

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:42.200
model elements.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:54.870
And I should be able to get the more delectable that I've just added by saying get And then

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.250
you would provide the key.

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.320
You know,

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.610
kids,

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.050
it's going to be the string,

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:08.830
said the file and re launch our application.

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:15.750
And if you go back,

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:28.120
re lord and click submit and you would see the model data getting populated Really,

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.820
contacts is one of these attributes that are deciding in this matter.

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:48.150
Obviously God,

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.550
no.

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:56.790
And the way this works is the moment you send the request to this particular you are.

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:03.050
Then spring will scan all the methods that are annotated with mortal attribute,

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:09.050
and it would create a temporary map with all the key value pairs.

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:13.400
So let's say that you have 10 different moral attribute methods,

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:18.750
and Springwood scan through all of them and create a temporary map with all the key value

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:19.350
pairs.

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.830
And only after doing so,

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:23.420
we'll go ahead and call.

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:27.370
The handler mattered one thing,

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:33.760
which is also what mentioning is the methods that are annotated with morel attribute well

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.390
except all the perimeters,

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:37.250
that other hand lament that would accept.

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:46.040
So whatever the arguments that you can send to this method can also be sent for for this

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.650
method,

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:51.500
which off course also means that you can do whatever you want with those objects.
