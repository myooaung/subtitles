00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.610
in a typical application,

00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:03.370
we might have a lot of controllers,

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:08.440
and we don't want to apply all interceptors in all the controls that ever existed in our

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:09.050
project.

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:11.410
That would be very inappropriate.

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:12.760
For example,

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.010
consider the following scenario.

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:17.550
Let's say you have a banking application.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.350
You don't want to use that to log in in order to see the register page,

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.620
because only if he registers,

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:25.940
can they use the log in.

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:26.740
Similarly,

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.250
don't want to restrict the user.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:34.180
When the user is trying to access the home page and same is with the log in page,

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.210
you don't expect their user to log in in order to log in.

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:39.510
That does make sense.

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.520
But there are certain pages in our application that only the logged in users should be able

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.060
to see,

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:46.710
for example,

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.590
dashboard or account information,

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:50.350
etcetera.

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:51.410
In this case,

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:57.320
we want our intercepted to come into picture only for these two cases and not for the rest

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.220
of the cases.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:04.710
So I'm going to be using a your baton and check to see if the Ural has this text,

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:05.080
innit?

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:05.700
User.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:06.650
If it does,

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:08.550
then I want to activate the interceptor.

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:10.350
So let's see how it's done.

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.950
We don't have a banking application to demonstrate,

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.240
but we're going to use our existing application.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.470
So currently,

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.560
if you enter something in click submit query,

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.190
you're able to say this message.

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.010
I went up a restriction on this page.

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:26.280
Only the user is authenticated.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.870
Should he be seeing this page?

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:30.850
Let's go back to eclipse.

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:40.150
So currently we have our interceptor and is applicable in all the your worlds.

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.450
Now let's up by the restriction.

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:48.690
We can use one of the methods available we have add part baton,

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.350
or you can even exclude apart baton.

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.020
And as an argument you want to provide a string,

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.050
which is basically kind of like a regular expression.

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:03.350
You want to provide the Ural pattern that you want to active it.

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:04.680
In my case,

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:11.940
I'm going to say hello because I know that my application your is having the word hello.

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:20.410
In order to view this page and then followed by any text,

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.450
I'm going to save the file.

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.690
And from this point on,

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.990
if I run the application,

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:35.450
go back,

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:44.650
enter something and it should be able to see interceptors coming into picture.

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.580
Let's go back and change the text of something else.

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:53.250
And this time,

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.700
if we run the application,

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.550
our interceptors should not come into picture.

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.250
Let's give it a try,

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:10.650
test or whatever.

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.960
And there you have it.

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:20.410
Interceptors didn't come into picture because off the restriction that we applied letter

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:25.910
that I want to use it to log in when they're trying to access a your that has Hello in it.

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:32.940
I'm going to make some modifications inside our interceptor code instead of returning true

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.940
,

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.420
I'm going to be returning falls Now.

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:42.840
You tell him that we had sent a database query in the user authentication failed and

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:53.300
instead going to say response dot Get right,

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:57.850
ah dot Right.

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:01.890
And I'm going to send some text.

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.160
Please log in.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:14.060
This time we are abruptly holding the process off forward in the request of the controller

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.060
.

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.900
Instead,

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:16.570
we're handling it ourselves.

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:21.450
Let's run our program and see how things will go.

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:28.900
And I'm going to enter test.

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.920
Please log in.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:34.210
We didn't see the controller logic taking place.

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.340
Hope it makes sense.

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:38.450
I will see you soon
