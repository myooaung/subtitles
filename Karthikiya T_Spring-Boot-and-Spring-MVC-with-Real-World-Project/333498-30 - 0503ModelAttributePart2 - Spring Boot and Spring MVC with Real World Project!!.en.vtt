00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.050
another advantage off model attribute is that it will help you map all the form details

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:10.670
with the command object going back to our application.

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:18.100
Once the user fills this farm and clicks on proceed were able to carry all those details

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.260
into the command object.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.850
And so we're able to display them.

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.770
Has a text in this page.

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:26.750
If you take a look at the form,

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:33.550
we have this object which is a command object,

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:40.250
and all these fields are actually mapped to the fields in here.

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:47.650
The text field is mapped to this field.

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:54.650
Indistinct options which were chosen are mapped to use a choice.

00:00:54.650 --> 00:01:00.210
But if you notice once the uses of Mr Phone,

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.420
we didn't really take care of converting the request perimeters and mapped them with the

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.150
fields in this command object.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.570
It's all they can get automatically.

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:10.290
Well,

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:20.140
that was possible because off the sanitation model attribute on the wouldn't explicitly

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:25.860
mention the annotation in here it is implicitly assumed,

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.250
like so.

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:33.510
We thought this feature we would have to manually read all the perimeters and then sort off

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.850
map all those elements with the fields in this command object.

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.430
So this generation definitely says.

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:40.690
There's a lot of her fort.

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:46.680
Sometimes you may not want to bind the form with the common object.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:47.680
In that case,

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:53.050
you can use the following attributes for the sanitation.

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:58.340
Finding equals force by default.

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:59.250
This is true,

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:05.020
my specifying So you're telling spring that you don't want to bind with the form instantly

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.290
want to read this object from the mortal itself?

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.950
So you may have another mattered something off this sort,

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:27.130
and then the written type is going to be whatever you want and he would get done and new

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.640
custom.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.550
T something of this sort.

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:40.850
Let me just quickly populate some details of that.

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.980
We can show some data,

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:49.440
and I would say CD dark,

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:50.270
set,

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:53.350
name,

00:02:53.350 --> 00:03:07.660
best name and then finally done said the file.

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.020
And let's relaunch our application.

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:20.550
Reload the page and it doesn't matter what you enter.

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:23.690
Since we disabled the binding,

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:29.690
we have the object picked up from the model.

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:34.990
And in case,

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:38.130
if you don't have this model attribute in here,

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:46.540
then then spring is actually going to create a brand new instance off this by itself that's

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:47.940
real on your application,

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:57.950
and this time you just don't see any data at all.

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:04.460
Hope it makes sense
