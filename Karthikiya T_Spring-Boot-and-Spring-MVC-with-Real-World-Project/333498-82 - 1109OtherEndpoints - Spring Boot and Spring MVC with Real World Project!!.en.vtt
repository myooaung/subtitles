00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.930
We have a lot off endpoints provided by spring congestive for to the documentation and have

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:09.850
a quick look at it.

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:22.350
But we've already discussed some of the major ones can actually take a look at all the

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.350
support of endpoints,

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:27.850
but sending get request to just actuator.

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:34.250
And here's a quick summary off all the endpoints that you're going to take a look at.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:42.140
So I would encourage you to play with the actuator.

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.150
Just add the dependency and you have everything in place.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.560
Hope it makes sense.
