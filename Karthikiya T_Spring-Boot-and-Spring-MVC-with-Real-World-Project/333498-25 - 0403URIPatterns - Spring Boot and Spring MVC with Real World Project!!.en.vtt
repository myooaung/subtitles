00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
you can use certain special characters to express your your baton.

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.910
We have this question mark symbol that would match with any off the character,

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.450
an example of which can be seen in here.

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:16.460
We have this request mapping annotation with this year old baton.

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.910
So this will accept all the your requests that would have the following text.

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.580
And this question mark can be any character.

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.650
Here are some examples off valid Urals.

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.990
This would match with that baton.

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:37.960
This would also match with that pattern because we have the exact same characters.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.570
And in place of question mark,

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.190
we have some random character.

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:47.950
But this year Orlin here is not valid.

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:58.350
Who said org But there is no he and so this would be qualified has a valid your or your I.

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.350
Similarly,

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:10.080
you can use the symbol and that would mean zero or more characters similarly can also use

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.250
double star in this manner,

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.390
and it would match with anything,

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.350
including the forward slashes.

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:26.870
So when you say order slash double star slash than any your that starts with this

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:28.140
particular set off,

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:35.890
characters would be qualified as a valid your whereas in here it doesn't start with that.

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:37.370
And so this is invalid.

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:43.450
You cannot a mix and match all these three symbols and create a Patton.

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:44.600
Something like this,

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.580
and it would work as well.
