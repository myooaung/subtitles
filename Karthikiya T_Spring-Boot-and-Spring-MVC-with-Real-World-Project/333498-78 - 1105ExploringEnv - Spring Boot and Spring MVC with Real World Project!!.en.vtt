00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.730
If you'd like to take a look at all the list often Roman very boats or system properties or

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:08.950
the properties that you configure inside your project,

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:13.290
then you can make use off the same point he envy stands for enrollment.

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.700
It may collapse all of these.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.070
Take a look at them one by one.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:28.050
So you know the list off properties available inside the application or properties file.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:34.490
You can have multiple properties file like this and all those properties orb aggregated

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:36.050
under this section.

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.830
So what are the stuff that you can see in here?

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:42.950
You can see all of them here as well.

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:43.970
So you have name,

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:44.560
description,

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:45.250
version,

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.540
perfect suffix everything,

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.550
but is mentioned in here.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.850
Similarly,

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.950
you can take a look at all the list off and Norman variables.

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:07.300
So somebody in here should be able to see the Java Home and Roman Variable that you had

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:12.550
configured just this and that points to the Jessica directory.

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:21.050
And here are the other and Roman variables exposed to our application.

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:29.950
We also have list off system properties that spring is going to use.

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:35.100
Here's a home directory,

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.250
etcetera.

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.310
I mean,

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.150
just try to hit this your land can explore it yourself.

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:48.630
Currently don't have any in it,

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:49.370
parents.

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:51.890
It is a self report.

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:58.390
100 points to wear the 80 here.

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:58.900
Tous.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.920
So that's a quick somebody off all the and Rome.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.640
And variables and system properties,

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:07.350
etcetera.

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:15.720
You can actually send a request to a specific property source application.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:16.360
Dark,

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.650
proper thes.

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:26.250
And this will fetch everything that apart off our properties file.

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.670
Or you could also say so over.

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:32.750
Dr Port,

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.920
Huh?

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.150
Have been copy it from here.

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:46.550
So you have locals have report,

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:50.150
like so.

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.370
All right.

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:55.570
Hope it makes sense.
