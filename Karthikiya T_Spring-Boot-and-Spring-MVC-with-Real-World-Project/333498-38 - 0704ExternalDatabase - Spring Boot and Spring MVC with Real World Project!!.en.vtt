00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.350
in case if you'd like to use any external database,

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:06.050
not one off the embittered databases available,

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:12.350
then you have to add it specific driver dependency inside the palm dot xml file.

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:13.560
In my case,

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:20.060
I'm trying to connect supposedly a skill database that is install elsewhere and so have Dad

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.060
.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.980
It's specific.

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.180
Driver dependence is as follows.

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.560
And once you do that,

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:33.780
you have to change your schema both video as well as the M L to make it work with the

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.550
database off your choice.

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.500
So I've changed his statements a bit to make them compatible with was re SQL database.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:47.680
And after that you have to add all the connection batter meters inside the application dot

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.750
properties file just as you see in here.

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.710
In addition to that,

00:00:53.710 --> 00:01:00.990
you have to manually enable the data initialization so that these files would be executed

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:08.050
in the database and that is possible with this perimeters.

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:09.320
Well,

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:15.780
you can take a look at the default para meters inside the application that properties file

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.080
and sort of get a sense off what each one of them do.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:27.260
You can actually hold your mouse on one of these properties and take a look at the

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.080
description and get a sense off.

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.460
What the purposes Down the line ones who introduced J.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.740
P.

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:34.970
A and Hibernate.

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.250
We would be using some of these anyway.

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.850
But that's about how you can access external database.

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:52.350
I can just run the program and see it working.

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:58.410
You can also customize the data source if you wish.

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:59.550
Well,

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:01.110
with spring boot,

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.680
we didn't get to configure The data source is taken care by spring itself,

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:06.490
but in kids,

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:07.870
if you want to customize it,

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:13.650
then you can introduce the Java Contact File and configure the data source in there,

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.550
just as you would do with any other spring project.

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.570
Hope it makes sense.
