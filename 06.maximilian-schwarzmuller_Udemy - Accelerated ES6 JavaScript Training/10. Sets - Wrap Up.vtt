00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:02.790
So that's the set.

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:04.950
And why is that handy.

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.930
Well it's handy if you like the example I gave before I need to store values and kind of an array.

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.810
But you need to make sure that they're unique because for example IDs which are allowed to access certain

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:18.950
parts of your application on your page.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.490
Well then you won't really want to store them once and with a traditional array.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.860
You yourself would have to check if this value is already inside of the array.

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:33.230
Now if set you don't have to you just add it and if it's already there done fine it's omitted.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.170
And if it wasn't there then it is actually added.

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.270
So that's where the set really comes in handy.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:43.680
And therefore map and said really two great additions with good which give you a lot more flexibility

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:44.980
