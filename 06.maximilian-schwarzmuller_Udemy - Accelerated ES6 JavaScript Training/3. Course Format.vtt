00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.220
Throughout the course this is what you will see most of the time.

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:07.020
Jay Espen dot com.

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:14.370
It's a great website which allows you to if you just check javascript and Konsole up your rived javascript

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.000
code on the left.

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:26.040
Then if you lock something in a console and he'd run you'll see it show up on the right and I will use

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:31.620
this format throughout the course since it allows me to really focus on individual topics and show how

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:36.790
to work and quickly play around with them without having to mess around with HTML.

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:41.840
And changing something in on the HMO page which you then would not see and so on.

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:49.680
So really I will come back to using HDMI out and actually showing something on the page but most of

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.150
the time I would just stick to javascript on the console now.

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:59.820
And if you rightfully say well my application won't just lock things to the console while it isn't really

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:05.170
that hard a step from logging into the console to altering something in your age.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.170
Tim document.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.370
And indeed in the final project of course you will of course do that.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:18.120
So this is the format I will use most of the time and it should allow me to really give you a lot of

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:25.760
tiny examples which should allow you to quickly understand all the new things being added with iOS 6
