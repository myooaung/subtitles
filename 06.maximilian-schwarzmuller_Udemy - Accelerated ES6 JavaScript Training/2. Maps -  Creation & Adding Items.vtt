00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:08.190
So I'm here inside is and I don't want to start with the map object and the map basically is a collection

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.700
which maps key value pairs.

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:17.070
So if you store objects in a map and you assign it a key a unique key for which you can identify it

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.490
and which you can retrieve it and manage it.

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.760
So I'll start by creating some objects I want to store and therefore I'm going to go with the poker

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:27.670
theme here.

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:35.800
So I'm going to treat a card an ace card with a name which is a soap's spades.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:44.370
And I'm just going to quickly duplicate those two all two of them and create the card which should be

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.220
the king of clubs.

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.240
I'd say the king of clubs here.

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.280
So I got my two cards and now I want to store them in a poker deck and see.

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.550
And the deck will be a map actually.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.420
So I'm going to create a new deck here which is just in your map and map a new object which was introduced

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.080
with iOS 6 of course.

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:13.090
And then I can simply add an item by accessing my map and using essent method which allows me to well

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.030
set a new key value pair.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:21.700
Now I'm not pushing it because I'm not appending it at the end remember each key is unique there friends

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.530
setting key value pairs.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.070
I'm not adding them.

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:32.260
And if I'd set a key value pair of which the key already is in use then I'm just overwriting it.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:39.510
So here of course I'm introducing some new key value pairs and I'm giving it a key of A S for the ace

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:40.480
card.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.130
And then I'm just going to add another one or a set an average key value pair and go get an image keys

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.330
Casey for king of clubs of course.

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.970
And I sign my king card here.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:59.130
So now I stored two objects here in my set and I assigned those keys but which I can retrieve them by

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:05.850
the way and that's a way to create such a set would have been to pass a nested array here to the constructor

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:06.060
.

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.500
So an array.

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:13.290
And then inside this array a number every word the first element is the key and the second element would

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.990
be the value you want to assign to that key.

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.820
And if you want to assign multiple key value pair as well.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:25.460
And you just have multiple areas within the hour every all the time with key and value as elements.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.600
So that would have been the alternative of creating this map.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.160
But I'm going to go with this way.

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.700
Which of course is a bit longer but also very explicit.

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.050
And then the question is What can you do with that map.

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.640
How can you get the ball to use.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.680
How can you Duleep them and so on.
