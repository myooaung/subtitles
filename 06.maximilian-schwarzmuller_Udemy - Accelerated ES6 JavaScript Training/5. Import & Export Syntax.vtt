00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:04.430
There's also an additional syntax you have at your end.

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:12.400
Let's say I have the number one variable named A B and does this just some text.

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:20.180
Now I can add a number export and I can say export default AB.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:28.020
Now if the default keyword I make it the default export off this file and therefore in the script the

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:37.710
chips fall I can import AB from external JS

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.170
like that.

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:54.330
And if I then print a B here let's see what happens if I Lowthers you see some text that you see also

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.330
the difference in the import syntax.

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.480
I'm not using call the braces and I shouldn't.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:07.610
I mustn't because this is the default import or this is importing what this extra shares fall default

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.640
the exports.

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:10.880
So if the default keyword.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:19.270
I'm basically saying if you're just importing something from this file like here then refer to this

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:25.230
default export of which you may only have one in each file of course because you can only have one default

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:27.300
export of course.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.180
Therefore you also don't have to named as a B.

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.680
You may also you name it.

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.120
A for example.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.150
And now if I print this in a reload you'll still see some text.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.460
So this is just the default.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.040
And you may use whatever name you want to use for that.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.380
You also can assign aliases to your imports.

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:53.440
Let's say I want to use Keeble you here as another variable name in this file here.

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.620
Now I have to leave key value here in my import statement because otherwise javascript wouldn't know

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.110
what I want to import because I have multiple exports here.

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.130
So I'll have to leave it here.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:12.720
But with the ASCII word I could name it key here and then replace all the places where I use it with

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.780
key.

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.350
Now I very clear my console.

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:23.270
You see it still works and it's still even updates de-value because it's still the only reference I

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.830
was just from the renaming it.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.500
But it didn't change anything else.

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.230
I'm just giving it a different name which I can use for this file.

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:37.380
And this is of course number great way to really get justice to your needs and work with imports and

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.870
exports the way you need to work them.

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:47.130
You can also get rid of this import here and let's say I one to add default to dis import statement

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.710
and that will be difficult days because they already have multiple imports here and they have multiple

00:02:52.710 --> 00:03:01.430
exports years so I kind of have to tell javascript that I want to get default now.

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:08.820
I could do this by simply adding it here in front of all the others separated by a comma.

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:12.190
So an a clear way console you see just again works.

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:15.310
It's important to specify this the first element.

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:23.480
So I am working quite a lot here and I could also write this in a different way.

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.920
Now first I'll get rid of my default value export here for the next thing I could leave it but I want

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.140
to focus on something else.

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:37.970
So I'm not importing a default value here anymore so I'll also get rid of this part and I want to change

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:43.260
the way to import this if I want to import everything a file exports.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:49.770
So if I want to import everything which gets export here which I am right now doing anyways I can write

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:51.170
a story here.

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.620
So asterisk character.

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:02.170
And then I have to give it a name let's say imported or whatever.

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.210
There are probably better names now imported.

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:07.800
Let's see what this is.

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:18.480
If I print import here you'll see it's an object it's an object which has as properties everything which

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.110
the Rafal exports.

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:26.010
Therefore this object has a property key value and the property test which of course is exact is what

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.720
this fall here does export.

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:36.710
So by using this star or just asterisk import your and giving it a name.

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.220
This is required.

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:45.310
I basically tell Chello script to wrap all my exports pack them into an object and give me that object

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.460
.

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:53.330
And therefore here I can give of course to an Access important key value or Also important task.

00:04:53.350 --> 00:05:01.100
If I show this important test does of course also work as you see down here.

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:06.050
And if I print the key value then again does it still change.

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:09.210
Yes it still changes.

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:10.760
So the behavior is the same.

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:16.010
It's just a different way to import everything in together than to one single object here.

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:22.710
So with that you've seen a lot of examples regarding the modularity is 6 office and how the export and

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:24.710
import statements work.

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:31.530
Important thing again keep in mind this duchess Anning is only required for testing and in the final

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:36.630
specification when it runs natively in the browser you won't use this and you won't need this.

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:37.960
So keep this in mind.

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:46.140
Besides that I hope you feel well-prepared to work with that new syntax or to work with this new much

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:52.720
hilarity and if you want to use it nowadays and it will have a lecture on how to set up a workspace

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.390
to use E-6 today.

00:05:54.570 --> 00:06:01.320
But basically what you need is a compiler to get either 60 as 5 and the module load or like system cheapass

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:03.780
exactly the two things we set up here.

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:07.190
And with that onto the next topic which will be classes
