I welcome to dismantle and this much all we're going to have a look at maps and SATs no maps and SATs

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.720
are two new kinds of collections.

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:18.150
It's really used with 6 until now with ESX you're probably aware we mostly got a rate which basically

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:25.990
allows us to well have multiple elements multiple values in one single object in one single wild variable

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:26.010
.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.200
In the end probably.

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:33.960
And of course because got objects which also are kind of like collections with their field value pairs

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.600
though they're really more than that of course.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:43.080
So not really we don't have an equivalent to the classic map for example which exists in a lot of other

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:43.880
languages.

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:52.320
Well now we have with map here and from this module I'll show you a map and set work and that both objects

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.670
map objects and set object all to God.

00:00:54.810 --> 00:01:00.780
Well a number of variation all said and what the sense of that variation is so let's dive into that
