WEBVTT

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:07.410
For this project I'm going to use plunkers again because I need the chance to use multiple files because

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:14.710
of course we're creating a module or project now to create this modular project all again the tricks

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:20.220
are added and all need System Chiasson.

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:29.550
Let's see if this works like this again add system chess and then go to live preview here by clicking

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:30.270
on the eye.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:38.460
And again just because I didn't mention Plunker peel and K.R. but SEO is a Web site where you can create

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:45.660
little static web applications with Jamal Chello script and C S S and you saw this in the modules module

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.320
which is why a QuickStart get into that.

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:54.270
But to give a quick overview in the end which you started with you launched the editor button on the

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.910
front page of Plunker.

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.000
You got your code window here.

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.270
Here you can manage all your files.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.900
And on the right here with the eyesight you go to you live preview of your web page you can refresh

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:13.920
this with the screen refresh button and on the book item here you can install certain for Pardie libraries

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.820
into your project which you might need.

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.920
So that's the most important functionality and the only functionality we will use fraud is.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.190
Now I'm going to start by quickly dumping in some predefined styles.

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:27.830
Of course you find those attached.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.140
But since this course really isn't the both styling I thought I'd just well insert them right now.

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:34.260
And don't go.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.380
Don't go writing a whole lot of C S S.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.100
Again just use the attached see it's Asphaltic get started quickly.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:47.880
I also got some code for my index HMO file so I'm going to replace this age when tech in my body.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.320
Now you see already the other face you saw before and you feel fine.

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.340
This time I'll code attached to you again.

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.780
Why am I not going through this detailed and writing a while.

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:05.940
Just because I don't want to bore you with HVM Eliseus as lessons I won't go through what this could

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.450
actually does or what do we have here though.

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:14.410
We basically got the search array which is this label the city name label than the input field.

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:19.020
And then the show where we're button and then we get this part which we currently don't see which you

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.760
will conditionally show or hide.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:28.350
For javascript where we were show the loading text or downloaded city with its city name the or description

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.600
and the temperature and that's really all.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.310
And of course the java script part will be focused on and the scores is and what you will see me write

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.540
in detail.

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:37.920
Now the last thing is.

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.810
So it's for writing modular code and therefore we use system chiasm much loader.

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.970
I don't want to import my script like this with a script import tag.

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:56.490
Instead at the end of my body section here I will create a new script tag like so and I'm going to import

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:04.490
anything here instead I'll use the system chance to then import my aptitude test file.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.130
Now that doesn't exist yet so I'm going to create it first.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:13.920
I'll delete my script that as I don't need that anymore and then I'll try a new file and I'll name it

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.120
after Chaz So that will be what I work with.

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:28.190
And here let's just throw an alert where we say Pallo and updated before I was done.

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.570
Well telling but a fact that we see this alert I'm confident everything works.

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:38.310
You think you get rid of it so I don't get the Szilard all the time and if that got the basic setup

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.000
we will need for this project.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:45.690
And if you want to set this up on your local machine Well what you basically need is.

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:51.870
You will need a tiny server running your application so you won't be able to do this with the file protocol

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.690
just by opening it by double clicking it.

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.150
That would work with Dematteo muchall loader.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:03.040
You will need a tiny little server like that light little note server and you might just google for

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:08.150
it as one recommendation I have is the light server.

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:14.010
Just google for light server and then the very first results should be it here you will also find installation

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:20.190
instructions and with that light server you are able to host your app on a little server just serving

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:26.070
your static files which will allow system Chason to work correctly and load the modules they need to

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:28.210
load and that is what you need for it.

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.160
And then you would be able to follow along on your local machine.

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:36.390
Of course keep the folder structure you see here or in the file structure and you should be good to

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:37.080
go.

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.860
Nothing else is required there.

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:41.220
So with that let's get started writing or code
