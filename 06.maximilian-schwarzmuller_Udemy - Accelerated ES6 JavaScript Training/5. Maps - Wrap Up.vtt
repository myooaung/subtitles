00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:07.260
So that's the default map method or the map object excuse me.

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:13.380
I think it should be really straightforward to use with those key value pairs being stored set method

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.270
to set them or overwrite them.

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:18.000
Get method to get them to delete them of course.

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:24.810
And the for loop to go through them all and declare a method of course to clear you map a nice little

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:33.390
collection indeed because it allows you to not having to use object just storage key value pairs because

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.890
that was how you had to do it in the past right.

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.180
You had to create and you could object in order to be able to store key value pairs and that again is

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:48.330
a task you will encounter from time to time your in your code that you want to not only push items on

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:53.940
an array but instead store them together with a key but which you can retrieve them all to keep in mind

00:00:53.970 --> 00:01:00.040
the fact that each Kubler Perry unique is of course also a great addition or a great way which makes

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.060
sure that you're not by accident.

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.570
Well setting two interfering values or anything like that.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.900
So certainly a great addition the map object
