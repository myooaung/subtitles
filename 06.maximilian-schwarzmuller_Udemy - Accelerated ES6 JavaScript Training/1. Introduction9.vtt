WEBVTT

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:04.080
Well we really cheap a lot.

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.710
We went through a lot of topics for the scores.

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.450
And I hope you feel a bit more confident knowing about those.

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.140
Well upcoming changes or at least the changes you will be able to use in the browser.

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:24.540
Now you have a lot of tiny examples but I always think it's also great to see at least some of the parts

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:29.360
come together in a real object project excuse me the F-word.

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.000
And it's much a look into build such a project.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.620
It's a great way to exercise or practice certain things you'll learn.

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.170
Now what are we going to build.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.920
All we're building is super awesome web app which basically allows one to do one thing.

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.950
I can enter a city name click and share weather and you saw it loaded for a fraction of a second and

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.930
then shows me the current weather in London.

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:59.600
And of course I can also then changed is to go to Berlin for example updaters.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.760
So this is what we're going to build.

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:08.910
And even though it only has a few elements here on the screen it uses quite some things you saw throughout

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:13.660
this course for the marshals in this course so let's get started.
