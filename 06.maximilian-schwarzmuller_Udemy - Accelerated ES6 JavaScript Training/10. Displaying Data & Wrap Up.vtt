WEBVTT

00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:06.600
That to output it all treat and you function in the same file again you could trade and you fall if

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:15.480
you want I'll name it update weather and this will expect to get the weather data and then I just want

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.210
to set the elements I'm retrieving hitter the city description and so on.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.870
So I'm just going to copy them here and I can Exel some on my elements object I import here top Remember

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:28.660
this.

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:35.090
So elements then the element Webers city and here are d text content.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.330
Property is the one I want to overwrite.

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.570
So this is the built in dorm property text content which allows me to set the text off aged female element

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.950
.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:49.350
And here I want to use the data I passed to this function and that the city name which I do have because

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.550
Lebert data here is just the web or data object or class here.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:00.450
So the object based on this class and this class does have a city name property description property

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.730
and the temperature property.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.130
So therefore I'm set in the city name year and copy this.

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:14.060
And I also want to set the description text content here too.

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:22.610
But of course any of the scription properties then I want to set the temperature of course.

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:31.020
And here it is again the temperature field which will also trigger you get trap I set up here.

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:32.480
But this is not doing anything.

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.450
So that's all fine.

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.770
We could recon A-word the data back to Celsius if you want.

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.260
Maybe also good exercise but I will leave it like this.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.190
So I'm not signing all that but you wouldn't be able to see anything because I'm not showing it.

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.850
It's hidden by default and I'm not showing it at any point during my app right.

00:01:51.930 --> 00:02:02.610
So let's do this to all again use my elements object and here I want to show the element Webroot box

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.570
which is the box holding all these DTL elements up here.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:15.790
And here I want to set the style display to block because by default is set to 9 of course with that

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.350
being set up I still have to call this update weather method.

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:29.820
So I'm doing this here in the then block of code update weather and I'll pass my Weber proxy Tudor's

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.710
up check or to dysfunctioning excuse me.

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:38.250
Now to test all this make sure to enter your app ID here at the top your mind is blurred out but you

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.500
should enter yours.

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.210
And with that well let's see if this all works.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.020
I'll enter London and hit show weather it looks pretty good.

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.280
Let's check Berlin.

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:52.290
Also pretty good.

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.810
So Arap was almost finished.

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.520
Just some final touches to do.

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.220
But I think it's already amazing.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:04.080
We're able to search for it in different cities and look how quickly and cleanly we treated the supplication

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.020
.

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:08.560
Now some final touches necessary.

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:15.480
And one of the things you probably saw is we never see us loading text not as Apple's lightning fast

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.890
so therefore it's not that problematic.

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.710
But imagine you have a slower internet connection or anything like that.

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.960
It would be great to see that actually something is happening.

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:30.270
So in order to shouldest loading text here at the top after we checked that a valeted name was entered

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.750
.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:40.470
I want to access my elements object and then the loading text element.

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:48.190
And here I want to set the Issawi display to block so she showed a loading text.

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.050
And here at the bottom where I said my.

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.880
Well show my Weber data.

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:00.240
I want to set this to no one here at the top of course to make sure that I'm not showing any city names

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:00.440
.

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:04.700
Otherwise I wouldn't see the loading text or that would overlap or anything like that.

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:09.870
And on the other hand I will get rid of the loading text once the city has been loaded successfully

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.620
Sanches to those here at the bottom.

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:24.240
So with that if I now search for London again you should see loading forward a fraction of a second

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.320
at least so watch closely.

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:29.870
Yeah I think it was you could see it.

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:32.510
Let's try it again if I see a different set.

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:36.490
You should see it flicker up for part of a second day again.

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:37.220
Yes.

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.750
So here you can see it.

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:43.530
So that's the application No it's really finished.

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:45.990
As you can see not a whole lot of code.

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:52.010
Still a lot of the things you saw from this module with the new syntax for Aero functions reflect them

00:04:52.020 --> 00:05:01.140
proxy promises and so on and a really cool application in my opinion showcasing a lot of that even showing

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:03.900
how to connect to a third party sarees.

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:11.100
And with that I really hope this course was able to get you to the point you comfortably use the new

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:17.360
features know how to use them today with the well of tracery for example.

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:20.490
Compile it and to build amazing applications.

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:27.660
Beginning from today on I wish you all the best and hope to see you in read courses where Byne
