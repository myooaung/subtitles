00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:08.130
As explained do you reflect the API has something to do with metaprogramming and a common task in metaprogramming

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:15.150
so in evaluating your code at runtime what we do find out which properties your object actually has

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.070
because you might want to change them but you don't know at the time you write your code because it's

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.260
very dynamic which properties you'll have.

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.580
But you do of course know it at runtime.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:27.300
So you want to find out if.

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.980
Well in general which properties you have refl. has a method for dead.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:40.500
It has its own keys Mefford does expects one argument which is the name of the object for which you

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.190
want to find out the keys.

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.420
If I now run this what do you think we'll see in the console

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.930
underscore name and age.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.080
So it gives me all the properties set up in the constructor here.

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:58.900
Notice that it's not giving the name without the underscores is not the getter and setter but the keyword

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:00.940
properties set up in a constructor
