00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:08.730
So that it's been the module on modules and classes and I hope you'll learn and how this really helps

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:15.420
the language how it makes it easier to write more complex projects by splitting your code up over separate

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.410
files and using modules.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:25.200
And by doing so in the future at least without the help of any other packages or third party tools you

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.010
need to get this to run in your browser.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:35.710
You also saw how classes work how they are related to prototypes and how they make inheritance easier

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:36.780
and Javascript.

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.620
How would you make it easy to create certain blueprints and use and how they help you to work with the

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:48.090
objects and offer another very attractive way of doing so and shall a script.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:55.650
And with that I want to conclude there's module and classes module and we'll continue to the next one

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:57.460
which will be about symbols.

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.020
What that is you'll learn in the next lectures.

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.110
See you there by
