00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:10.510
Well I come to my ears six Bootcamp is six of course is the next javascript generation or werfen and

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:13.200
with the right tools you can already use it day.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:19.740
Therefore now is the best time to start learning it and to see which cool new feature is set up for

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.640
access for what the score is.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:29.640
I'll go for a lot of modules to show all this new features and explain what they do and how they work

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:30.010
.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:38.010
But start with some syntax changes or extensions so those seven new methods or additions you have at

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.960
your disposal then we'll have a look at modules and classes.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:50.160
Of course a very important addition with ESX declasse keyword and the fact that we can actually write

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:57.450
code in a modular way distribute it over multiple files with the old ones that support both browsers

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:57.590
.

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.320
The need of third party helpers.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:06.190
Any other tools to load or files will then have a look at symbols.

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:12.130
One of the big new additions with iOS 6 What symbols are how they work and how you can use them.

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:19.440
Thereafter we'll have a look at iterators and generators which are bit connected to some boards and

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.910
also offer you create new functionalities.

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.430
And here again you learn what they are and how they work.

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:28.630
Then we look at Promises.

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:35.270
Now you might already know promise and promises are pretty common now days but they're not natively

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.860
bolt into eight years five and therefore with your sakes they are.

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.400
And here we'll have a look at all their work.

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:43.670
Now we can use them.

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.430
Thereafter it's time to have a look at some of the built in objects and some extensions.

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:56.520
Those objects got so new methods available on the object for example then I'll have a look at maps and

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.780
sets which are new collection types added with the ESX.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.460
Thereafter it's time to have a look at the reflect API.

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:12.360
A brand new API added to iOS 6 which funnels a lot of the functionalities which already were included

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.290
in years 5 and also add some new ones.

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:21.630
And it especially works great in conjunction with the proxy API which is old and brand new and allows

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:29.430
you to wrap objects and then well handle certain operations set down on those objects and you will learn

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.980
how everything works in this module.

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:38.550
And even though you'll see a lot of examples for all this modules It's always cool to have a project

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.770
where you can see all those things come together.

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.740
Therefore I'll have a little project at the end where we see some of those things being used and how

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:56.130
to use them and also give a brief article on how to use it today and how to set up your work environment

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:02.050
to well take advantage of U-6 today and create reasonable and usable applications.

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:08.580
But E6 today even though browsers don't support it fully yet for this course you'll all see cheat sheets

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.800
attached to the last lectures and all those modules and those cheat sheet should really help you.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:20.730
Q Well you've exercised the things you learned in the modules to dig a bit deeper to find references

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.120
helping you and so on.

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.790
Definitely have a look at them too.
