Of course you can also export classes.

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.720
Not here I'm not an plunkers so I'm not really showing that.

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:14.090
But it works exactly the same like we were before or using export to export variables or functions.

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.050
We export class like this.

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:19.960
And then number fall you imported by name help or in this case.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:26.970
And then you may use it in the whole file and that of course is a cool way to have for example a separate

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.520
file for each class you set up.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:35.220
And then in these code files where you want to use this class you imported that the top and are able

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:36.270
to use it.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.090
This is how you probably know it from other languages.

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.700
And finally with basics you'll be able to do just that with native shell script
