WEBVTT

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:09.480
Back in the chips fall here I want to create a new web for Bader.

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:15.140
Check the web or dater should be new whatever data.

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.200
And of course for this to work I need to import it.

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:19.440
So import

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:29.270
weather data from the weather data.js file

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:40.210
and the constructor as you created it here expects to get the city name and description.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:46.500
So I'll pass those two arguments all pastie city name which I'm extracting right here were a search

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.980
for it of course.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:01:00.300
And then the response data which to promise gives me and remember in the promise we're already creating

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.450
a checklist of all with the chase and Parus method.

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:08.660
So now it's all about extracting the description of the waiver.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.180
Now if we have a look at the API description here at parameters of API I respond.

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.960
You see how a response will look like.

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.540
Now description I'm interested in is this one here.

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.410
The broken clouds example here.

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:28.560
So as you can see we got a checklist group object which has a weather property which holds an array

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:30.420
in this array.

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:38.280
The very first argument or element is an average telescope object where we then have the desired description

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.720
property.

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:47.940
So therefore I can access this description by accessing whether remember that's the very first property

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.410
which gives me this right here.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.720
And the first element in this array.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.630
And then description on the resulting Chalons object.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:03.570
And then I want you to just well convert this to uppercase with the shovel strip method to uppercase

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:04.710
here.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:12.600
So with that I'm creating my Weber data I'm just giving this a little bit more space again so that you

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:19.330
can see this all but I'm not assigning the temperature yet of course or this.

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:27.680
I'll wrap it in a proxy so I will create a new proxy here like you learned in the proxy module or pass

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.350
my webwork data object which actuated and aligned the forward.

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:41.550
Which does it all take that one to wrap and then I will pastie wherever proxy handlers so this proxy

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.850
handler I tweeted and then Weber data file of course.

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.280
Therefore I also need to import this.

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:57.660
So whether proxy handler should be imported from this web or data module with this proxy now in place

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:06.480
I can use this web or proxy to now access temperature which will now be followed as proxy and intercept

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.200
that by the proxy since I do have a set trap being set up here right.

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:20.660
So now if I try to set this I will trigger this trap and therefore it will get converted.

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:26.490
Now what I want to set of course is my response state temperature and let's have a look at the example

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:27.720
response.

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:32.840
Kids see the temperatures here in the main property which returns a number chance to object.

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.140
And here we got this temp.

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:41.550
Now here are the example it's Kelvin which is the default unit if you don't specify unit but we specified

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.220
units metric here.

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:48.170
We will get it back and solaces decrease.

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:52.710
So again to access that access main and then temp.

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:59.880
So daubs Main got 10 and this will get converted from the proxy.

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:02.270
Well we're almost there.

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:07.620
The missing piece of course is to put it in our age old code in our page here
