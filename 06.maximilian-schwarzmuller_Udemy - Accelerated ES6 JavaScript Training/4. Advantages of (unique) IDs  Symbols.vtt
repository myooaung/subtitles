00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:04.360
And as a final example why this is useful.

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:10.990
All turned us back to D for definition here so to have the same idea again.

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.850
Let's say my person here already has H.

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:17.060
Property which is 30.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.900
And I'll leave the rest.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:28.790
So here I'll also print out person age referring to this age property.

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:29.670
What do you think.

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.570
And I'll get it for his run.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.170
I get 27 or 30.

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.010
That was the other reason I was talking about why symbols are great.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:45.840
I'm not over writing age here even though I do have th key here it is again some unique ID.

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:52.620
You don't know you concierge's probably a long string a long number whatever it is a unique ID in the

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:59.580
background and therefore this age symbol I added here has nothing to do doesn't override this h property

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:05.340
which person already has which of course is very useful to make sure that you're not accidentally doing

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:06.430
something like that.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.000
And this is why I have access to both properties Uruk and get different values.
