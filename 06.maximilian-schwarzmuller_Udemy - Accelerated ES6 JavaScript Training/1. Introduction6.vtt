00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.230
Come to yet another module in this course we already had a look at quite some new features that were

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:07.990
added.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:14.340
And in this module I want to have a look at some objects or functionalities we already had in chapels

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:20.460
crypt which got some extensions which got some extra functions we can use and so on.

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.200
So that built in objects which were extended.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:24.860
Let's dive into that.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.520
Now for this module year I'll go over some of the highlights.

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:34.320
More important methods were extensions I've found and I think are great.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.130
Generally the best approach always is as I cover them all.

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:49.120
If you interested in well which methods Moff object offer is Google for javascript Moff.

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.390
And then you will find an article from the end the end the smuggler Developer Network.

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:04.020
And in this article and that same is available for strings number is the object ragbag swiftly for everything

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.000
really everything you will find such an article.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.180
And here you found all the properties and methods and if you scroll over dead you pretty much understand

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.870
why I'm not going through all of them step by step.

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:21.270
So that's just a little reminder so that you're not sad that not everything's covered or that you think

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.670
well there aren't dead many functions and Chubb of crap right.

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.840
Well there are just won't cover them all here.

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.800
I'll pick the most interesting ones.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.630
