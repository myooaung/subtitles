00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:08.000
So that concludes this module on some object extensions or new methods which were added to built in

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.410
methods and functions.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:15.600
And as I already explained that the beginning definite you look at the Mozilla developer network for

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.470
more information for example on regular expressions.

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:25.290
There were also some additions if you want to dive into that as I really can give you a brief overview

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.390
and then go into every single new edition as you surely understand.

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:32.760
With that it's time to move on.

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:40.850
And in the next section have a look at a major big new addition to javascript maps and sets.
