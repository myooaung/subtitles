00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:07.980
Your six also introduced a new loop to work with remember and use five you already had the for loop

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:15.810
you had the while loop to do while loop for loop to loop through keys and the object with iOS 6 You

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:18.180
also have four awful loop.

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:24.940
And in order to demonstrate this all create a new variable here test results which is an array.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.820
And here I'll just have some floating point numbers and of course it will work with any relevance you

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:30.780
might have for.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.090
So that's just an example.

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.020
And then I can create this for loop like a traditional for loop.

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.740
I'll have my test result.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:48.930
So no plural here just convention this name is of course totally up to you off test results so the second

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:55.650
part here is the value or the variable for which I want to loop through those values of this entry and

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:02.730
the first one is to each individual element office array will be assigned to in each iteration of this

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:03.980
loop.

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:12.720
So now I can for example simply block best result here and I saw that I have a typo so I'll quickly

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.780
paradise and if I now hit run what do you think will happen.

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.410
Well now I get the values printed out.

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.340
Of course this could have been achieved before with a for loop.

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:29.850
But this is a shorter syntax and it's perfect for looping through areas and that is what it's there

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.770
for you to quickly grab the individual elements off an array and do something with them.

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.460
Here in this block of the for loop.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.510
So that's the four of loop being added.

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.960
Pretty straightforward but also pretty useful.
