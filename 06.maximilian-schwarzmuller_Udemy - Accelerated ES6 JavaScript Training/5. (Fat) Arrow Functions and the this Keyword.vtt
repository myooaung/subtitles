00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:07.590
I'll create a new function the traditional style and this function.

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:14.850
All I want to do is I want to log this now I'm going to comment out the time but for now because I first

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:18.810
want to show something else it will also give this function a name that's name it.

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:24.700
And if I call and here or what would you expect to see if I had run.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.380
Well they get the window object.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.690
That's what we see here.

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.330
The object already window holding our application to global scope.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.770
This is what this will refer to generally.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:44.850
Now also a rewrite this with the error function like this.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.690
And here I will simply also log this.

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:58.430
Now if I call this function here on account of the first function call but there I think I'll get up

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:59.870
and run.

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.190
I get it when object as well.

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.800
This doesn't change it's still referring to the global context because this is the context in which

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.310
this variable orders function here is set up right.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.930
It's in the global scope so it makes sense that this refers to the global scope to the new object.

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.560
So far so good.

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:27.150
Now get rid of all of that and all of my function calls here and I'll pull that up to the top.

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.060
Next all go to HMO.

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:36.230
Because I went to add a button here in my HTML body and all it just click to name a test.

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:43.620
I also want to select my body hearer's so I wool's or my button here excuse me so I will use a query

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.260
selector here to quickly grab hold of it

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:56.700
and at the bottom of my code what I want to do was I want your side and you and listener Tudor's button

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.880
and you'll soon see why I'm doing all of this.

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:05.220
I want to listen to the click and then I want to execute the functions so the normal the old style function

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:06.120
here.

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:11.690
If while this happens and you see we still print this year.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.670
So now if I go to the Panera much javascript code and I click this test button What do you expect to

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:18.100
see.

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:25.370
Remember before we saw the window object and this is what this should refer to use perfect like test

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.690
here what will we see we get an object.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.360
But this is not the window object as you will see if you scroll to the top.

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.600
It's our H T and all button element cell.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.500
This actually refers to what call this function.

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.850
And that's what I explained in each boot camp course.

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:50.370
So therefore this no longer refers to the window but now it refers to the button as the button is to

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.600
one calling this function the end.

00:02:53.610 --> 00:03:01.260
Now this might be the behavior you want but in most languages it's not the behavior you expect you wouldn't

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.800
expect.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:08.730
For this to change its context here and to refer to different things depending on what caused dysfunction

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:09.420
.

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:15.950
Generally you you would expect that this always refers to to what it is when you define this function

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.450
so the global scope in this case here.

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:26.430
So if I exchange my ventless or to now use function to the arrow function here what do you think will

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:31.590
now happen if I run with G-S and then click test.

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:37.080
Now I actually get the window object as you can see if you scroll up all the top here.

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:45.540
Sell the arrow function actually keeps its context and that is super important to understand because

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.710
dad really is the main difference saving some is shorter syntax.

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:57.750
That's all nice but the key difference to understand is that this is treated or handled differently

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.660
with the third arrow functions.

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:07.530
You won't need bind or apply or call all those work arounds you use with ears 5 to get this to the right

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:13.100
context but it will just keep the context in which this function is defined.

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:19.530
So if this refers to the know object here it will refer to that with no object no matter how or where

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.830
you call this at this function here.

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.970
This effort and to function that's super important to take away.

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:32.140
And the other function the old style which you may still use it's not bad by any means.

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:38.730
It's just important to understand here this will behave like you know it to behave in shallop it will

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:44.240
change to what it is and that is a super important key deference
