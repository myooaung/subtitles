00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:03.010
So that's all super.

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:07.960
But the question is what's the prototype of Maxton.

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:12.050
Well let's check it by adding something else here at the bottom.

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:20.800
Cons a lock and I'm just freeing up some space your console lock.

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:25.060
Max Dunner produ again produ.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:32.230
This is the quilt to max Dudd prototype.

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.680
Let's see what happens if it run.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.410
It's true.

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:42.050
Is it also equal to person.

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.930
What we think we'll see.

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.020
It's false.

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:54.600
So the prototype of Macs still is maxed out prototype but we're still inheriting everything from this

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.620
person class.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:03.360
So is it therefore equal to present a prototype.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:12.810
No it is really maxed out prototype but mix of prototype kind of has wall the same features as the per

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:14.250
class cyclospora setting up.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:22.860
And this is what extents does it gives us this specific class and allows us to use all the features

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.530
properties methods the parent class created
