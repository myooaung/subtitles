00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:04.460
So you conclude this section on proxies.

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:13.020
I want to introduce one other notion of proxies or when other kind of proxies we always saw the default

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:17.970
proxy we used all the time but there are also revokable proxies.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.880
Now as to name Saiz revokable proxies can be well rewarded.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:29.460
That means after you set up such a proxy as a wrapper you can kind of well remove that functionality

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.550
.

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:35.230
You can of course not make your code undone but you can make sure that the proxy is no longer active

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.370
.

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.650
And I'll show you how this works.

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:45.300
So again my personal object here which is created with literal notation as the name x again and then

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:52.980
again I'll create my handler here real quick and I'll have my Geter which has this function which takes

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:59.850
target property may also take a receiver of course and I'll stick with that.

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:08.100
And then I will simply return refl. get Target property.

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.290
Oh I don't have any checks here.

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.980
I'm simply forwarding it.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.460
And everything passes.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:20.700
And yeah I get all the properties I want to get a next I want to trade my proxy and now that's a bit

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.520
different here.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:32.580
I'll use the deconstructions you actually created or create a proxy and a reward function which I can

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:33.960
call.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:43.050
I do get both from calling proxy revokable so proxy revokable basically returns me an object which has

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.820
a proxy and a remote field.

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:52.410
I pass my personal object and of course my handler to that function.

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:53.900
So that is the same as before.

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:59.550
But the important is the revokable part this function call and the fact that I get back and object which

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:04.940
I immediately deconstruct here of course you don't have to do that but yet I chose to.

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:17.650
So with that I can now console Roxette of name and see what happens if I had run C-Max like before were

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.810
able to access the field food as proxy.

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:28.680
But now let's see what happens if I invoke it with the revoke function I'm getting back here.

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:34.170
So I call revoke and then I try to log out my name through the proxy.

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.730
What do you think will now happen.

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.260
Well I get an error that the proxy has been revoked.

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:47.650
So that's a great addition because also in your code you might have the functionality that you want

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:48.390
you.

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:53.380
Well revoke or remove a proxy after a certain U-bend happened or whatever.

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.090
And then the revokable proxy is of course the solution for your problem.

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:03.930
It allows you to still wrap your object with a proxy but if you don't need it anymore you can simply

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.880
get rid of it and revoke it
