Hello and welcome to this art tutorial this tutorial is the fun tutorial because we did our job by finding

2

00:00:07.260  -->  00:00:12.240
the optimal number of clusters thanks to the general gram and by fitting the Haria I could call clustering

3

00:00:12.270  -->  00:00:18.630
algorithm to our data X and now show time we will be visualizing our clusters using the cluster plot

4

00:00:18.690  -->  00:00:19.700
method.

5

00:00:19.770  -->  00:00:25.860
However we will not rewrite the whole code because as you will see we make the exact same code structure

6

00:00:25.950  -->  00:00:27.380
as we did for commune's.

7

00:00:27.390  -->  00:00:33.060
So now what I'm going to do is I'm going to open our Kamins code and I will show you that because we

8

00:00:33.060  -->  00:00:37.830
have the same code structure between Kamins and the hierarchical clustering we just need to replace

9

00:00:37.830  -->  00:00:43.130
one tiny little thing to plot our five clusters attained by hierarchical clustering.

10

00:00:43.320  -->  00:00:49.770
So let's go to files here then let's click on these two dots here to go back to our part 3 clustering

11

00:00:49.770  -->  00:00:53.220
folder to find our Kamins clustering folder.

12

00:00:53.610  -->  00:00:58.230
And in this game it's folder Let's open the Kamins or our file.

13

00:00:58.470  -->  00:01:03.320
And now let's compare our Tucows for hierarchical clustering and Kamins clustering.

14

00:01:03.660  -->  00:01:10.890
So in step 1 we both did exactly the same thing we imported our small data set then in step 2 we looked

15

00:01:10.890  -->  00:01:14.200
for the optimal number of clusters using two different methods.

16

00:01:14.280  -->  00:01:19.180
The elbow method for k means in the den program for hierarchical clustering.

17

00:01:19.530  -->  00:01:27.200
Then in Step Three we fitted our algorithm to our data X and we created our vector of clusters y Kamins

18

00:01:27.320  -->  00:01:32.140
in K means and why H.C. in hierarchical clustering.

19

00:01:33.060  -->  00:01:39.060
And now if we look at the last step visualizing the clusters in the Kamins algorithm we can see that

20

00:01:39.060  -->  00:01:46.320
the only thing in our code that is related to Kamins is a Y Kamins vector here and we have the same

21

00:01:46.320  -->  00:01:49.830
vector of clusters in our hierarchical clustering code.

22

00:01:49.860  -->  00:01:51.160
It's way H.C..

23

00:01:51.180  -->  00:01:56.430
So basically the only thing that we have to do to plot a cluster clusters in hierarchical clustering

24

00:01:56.920  -->  00:02:06.810
is to take our close plot function here with the same parameters copied and pasted in our hierarchical

25

00:02:06.810  -->  00:02:12.770
clustering visualizing the clusters and then the only thing that we have to do is to replace Wiking

26

00:02:12.780  -->  00:02:22.530
means by y H.C. and now it's ready let's elect our code section here execute it and voila that's our

27

00:02:22.530  -->  00:02:25.680
hierarchical clustering results.

28

00:02:25.950  -->  00:02:27.390
That's the end of this tutorial.

29

00:02:27.390  -->  00:02:33.150
But the fun continues in the next tutorial where we'll be analyzing our results and explaining what

30

00:02:33.150  -->  00:02:34.570
those clusters are.

31

00:02:34.590  -->  00:02:39.660
I will also explain how you can reuse this code for any other business problem and this will conclude

32

00:02:39.720  -->  00:02:41.100
our tutorials.

33

00:02:41.190  -->  00:02:43.720
So I look forward to seeing you in the next tutorial.

34

00:02:43.770  -->  00:02:45.780
And until then enjoyer machine learning
