00:00:00.270  -->  00:00:02.850
Hello and welcome to this art tutorial.

2

00:00:02.850  -->  00:00:08.310
So in a previous tutorial we just pre-processed our data set to make it ready for our logistic regression

3

00:00:08.310  -->  00:00:11.420
model that we will fit on the training sets.

4

00:00:11.430  -->  00:00:13.490
So that's what we're going to do in this tutorial.

5

00:00:13.500  -->  00:00:14.790
And let's do it right now.

6

00:00:15.000  -->  00:00:16.540
So it's going to be very simple.

7

00:00:16.590  -->  00:00:23.670
We're just going to create our classifier equals and then we're going to use an existing function of

8

00:00:23.760  -->  00:00:29.500
our go the G.L. and function that is going to build this logistic regression classifier.

9

00:00:29.820  -->  00:00:36.190
So let's type here G L M and then let's press F 1 to see what parameters we have to input.

10

00:00:36.590  -->  00:00:43.140
OK so the first thing we see is that GM is for generalized linear models and that's because the logistic

11

00:00:43.140  -->  00:00:47.910
regression is a linear classifier for those of you who didn't follow the Python tutorial you will see

12

00:00:47.910  -->  00:00:54.200
that our logistic regression classifier will linearly separate our two classes of users.

13

00:00:54.540  -->  00:00:58.940
And then let's look at the arguments to see where we have to input.

14

00:00:58.950  -->  00:01:01.190
All right so the first argument is formula.

15

00:01:01.410  -->  00:01:03.900
So that's the same as what we did in the regression section.

16

00:01:03.900  -->  00:01:12.060
Here we're going to write formula equals and then we take the dependent variable which is purchased

17

00:01:13.710  -->  00:01:20.470
then out plus N and then here a dot to specify that we want to take all the independent variables.

18

00:01:20.760  -->  00:01:27.630
So that way are understands that we want to predict the pre-Chase result based on all the independent

19

00:01:27.630  -->  00:01:33.150
variables which are the age and the estimated salary.

20

00:01:33.150  -->  00:01:33.650
All right.

21

00:01:33.690  -->  00:01:35.440
Now what is the next argument.

22

00:01:35.520  -->  00:01:39.930
So let's come here enter and let's add the second argument.

23

00:01:40.230  -->  00:01:46.500
So the second argument is family and here since we are in logistic regression we are going to add family

24

00:01:47.640  -->  00:01:50.600
equals binomial.

25

00:01:51.870  -->  00:01:57.690
So at this stage it's not important to understand what binomial means exactly but you just have to remember

26

00:01:57.690  -->  00:02:04.500
that for logistic regression you have to specify the binomial family here and then we just need to input

27

00:02:04.860  -->  00:02:06.320
one last argument.

28

00:02:06.330  -->  00:02:11.660
It's the data here which is the data on which you want to train your logistic regression model.

29

00:02:11.670  -->  00:02:13.950
So of course that's our training set.

30

00:02:13.950  -->  00:02:18.110
So we're going to add here data equals training set.

31

00:02:18.120  -->  00:02:19.250
Here we go.

32

00:02:19.350  -->  00:02:20.160
Here it is.

33

00:02:20.480  -->  00:02:21.310
OK.

34

00:02:21.690  -->  00:02:28.110
And that's it by only using this deal in function and resizing the formula the family and the fact that

35

00:02:28.110  -->  00:02:33.510
we're building the model on the training set that builds our logistic regression classifier.

36

00:02:33.520  -->  00:02:39.310
So now let's see like this come on control plus enter to execute.

37

00:02:39.720  -->  00:02:42.610
And here we go the classifier is built.

38

00:02:43.020  -->  00:02:47.940
OK so that's it for this tutorial we finished logistic regression to the trainset and then the next

39

00:02:47.940  -->  00:02:53.340
tutorial we will be predicting the test results using this classifier that we just built.

40

00:02:53.340  -->  00:02:55.140
All right thank you for watching this tutorial.

41

00:02:55.140  -->  00:02:57.010
I look forward to seeing you in the next one.

42

00:02:57.030  -->  00:02:59.050
And until then enjoy machine learning.
