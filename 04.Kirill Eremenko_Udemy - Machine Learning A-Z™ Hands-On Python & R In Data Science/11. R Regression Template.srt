00:00:00,210  -->  00:00:05,420
Hello and welcome to this art Tauriel So in a toil we're not going to make any mention or any model

2

00:00:05,430  -->  00:00:10,130
we're just going to make a template and this will be our regression template.

3

00:00:10,140  -->  00:00:14,560
So it's a template that is going to be very useful for the next non-linear regression morals.

4

00:00:14,550  -->  00:00:19,590
We're going to make like as we are modeled the decision tree regression model and the random for us

5

00:00:19,590  -->  00:00:20,770
regression model.

6

00:00:20,790  -->  00:00:24,760
So we're going to use this template to build these three next models and our.

7

00:00:24,900  -->  00:00:31,110
And also you can use this template to create a regression model for your specific problem because as

8

00:00:31,110  -->  00:00:36,090
you can see you will only have a few things to change so that you will build your machinery model very

9

00:00:36,090  -->  00:00:37,100
efficiently.

10

00:00:37,500  -->  00:00:43,530
So let's make this some plates and to make it we're going to go from what we did in polynomial regression

11

00:00:43,650  -->  00:00:45,300
and generalize the whole thing.

12

00:00:45,420  -->  00:00:52,920
So I'm going to take everything from here up to the end copy and I'm going to paste that in the template

13

00:00:52,920  -->  00:00:53,100
.

14

00:00:53,100  -->  00:00:55,750
And now let's make this template.

15

00:00:56,200  -->  00:00:58,710
OK so first of all let's start with the beginning.

16

00:00:58,830  -->  00:01:01,480
So the beginning was about preprocessing the data.

17

00:01:01,530  -->  00:01:03,420
So actually there is nothing to change here.

18

00:01:03,420  -->  00:01:08,220
We will keep Of course these two lines because we will work on the position salary C as we file and

19

00:01:08,220  -->  00:01:10,550
build our non linear regression models on it.

20

00:01:10,650  -->  00:01:15,450
And for the same reason as before we wanted to split the data set into a training set and it said because

21

00:01:15,450  -->  00:01:19,830
this is a small data set and we will leave features scanning as comments here.

22

00:01:19,860  -->  00:01:24,900
Since most of the libraries don't require us to apply features getting manually.

23

00:01:25,260  -->  00:01:31,760
So all good for the preprocessing phase and this will be the first part of our regression template.

24

00:01:31,770  -->  00:01:32,040
Great.

25

00:01:32,040  -->  00:01:33,650
Now let's move on to the next part.

26

00:01:33,840  -->  00:01:39,970
So the next part is about creating the model creating the model and fitting it to the dataset.

27

00:01:40,050  -->  00:01:45,690
So first of all in the previous Statoil we built two regression models the linear regression model and

28

00:01:45,690  -->  00:01:50,520
the polynomial regression model and that was just to compare the two results and to show you that the

29

00:01:50,560  -->  00:01:56,310
polynomial regression was much more appropriate to our problem because it was not a linear regression

30

00:01:56,310  -->  00:02:00,470
model as opposed to the linear regression model which is a linear model.

31

00:02:00,540  -->  00:02:06,750
So we only did that so that you can understand very clearly the distinction between linear models and

32

00:02:06,750  -->  00:02:07,950
non-linear models.

33

00:02:08,070  -->  00:02:12,810
But now that it's getting pretty clear in our minds we are going to get rid of this section here about

34

00:02:12,810  -->  00:02:19,320
linear regression because now we get the idea and we will only focus on the new non-linear regression

35

00:02:19,320  -->  00:02:24,540
models themselves without comparing them to the linear regression model but keep the graphic results

36

00:02:24,540  -->  00:02:26,410
of the linear regression model in mind.

37

00:02:26,460  -->  00:02:29,520
Keep in mind that it was a straight line not fitting very well.

38

00:02:29,520  -->  00:02:35,610
The data is set and therefore is not much appropriate to our data set where the data is nonlinearly

39

00:02:35,620  -->  00:02:36,710
distributed.

40

00:02:37,060  -->  00:02:41,130
OK so we're going to get rid of this done.

41

00:02:41,310  -->  00:02:46,330
Now we only have this code section here that creates the non linear regression mode itself.

42

00:02:46,380  -->  00:02:52,310
So we are going to get rid of this because this corresponds to the polynomial regression and to generalize

43

00:02:52,320  -->  00:03:02,820
we will just add a come here to specify that this is where we have to create our progress or right here

44

00:03:02,840  -->  00:03:03,250
.

45

00:03:03,600  -->  00:03:04,490
OK.

46

00:03:04,500  -->  00:03:12,450
And here we can also replace polynomial regression by the regression model and we are all good with

47

00:03:12,450  -->  00:03:13,380
this section.

48

00:03:13,650  -->  00:03:13,910
OK.

49

00:03:13,920  -->  00:03:18,260
Now let's move on to the next one the next one is about visualizing the results.

50

00:03:18,270  -->  00:03:24,720
So for the same reason as what we did in this section to fit the regression to the data set we will

51

00:03:24,720  -->  00:03:30,750
get rid of the graphic results of the linear regression model because we have them in mind and we only

52

00:03:30,750  -->  00:03:34,470
want to focus on our future non-linear regression models.

53

00:03:34,470  -->  00:03:36,350
So let's get rid of this.

54

00:03:36,510  -->  00:03:41,780
And now we only have the graphic results of our future non-linear regression model.

55

00:03:42,030  -->  00:03:42,690
Okay.

56

00:03:42,690  -->  00:03:47,190
And the great thing about this template is that in the section we will need to change anything with

57

00:03:47,280  -->  00:03:56,040
almost anything because we're going to replace polynomial regression by regression model and we're going

58

00:03:56,040  -->  00:03:57,110
to change this.

59

00:03:57,120  -->  00:04:03,480
Paul you reckon regress regressors here by regressors because you know before we called it Polly rag

60

00:04:03,480  -->  00:04:06,470
because we also had our Linnea our aggressor Lin Ray.

61

00:04:06,630  -->  00:04:08,520
And so we needed to make the distinction.

62

00:04:08,610  -->  00:04:14,430
But now since we got rid of the linear regression model we will call our future non linear regression

63

00:04:14,430  -->  00:04:19,540
model regressors here and that's why we put regressors here and the predicate function.

64

00:04:19,770  -->  00:04:25,200
So basically when we get to this section when we build our future non-linear regression model the only

65

00:04:25,200  -->  00:04:29,370
thing that we will need to change is actually the title here.

66

00:04:29,370  -->  00:04:34,650
Basically we don't have anything to change here and that's the great thing about this template.

67

00:04:34,680  -->  00:04:39,630
However of course if you're using this template on your data set and your problem well the only thing

68

00:04:39,630  -->  00:04:45,240
that you will need to change are the names here of the independent variable and also the name of the

69

00:04:45,240  -->  00:04:50,080
dependent variable here that you will have to replace salary by the name of your dependent variable

70

00:04:50,090  -->  00:04:50,280
.

71

00:04:50,490  -->  00:04:51,210
But that's all.

72

00:04:51,330  -->  00:04:57,660
OK and we're finally getting to the last section of this code template which is about predicting the

73

00:04:57,660  -->  00:05:00,850
final result to get our final verdict.

74

00:05:01,080  -->  00:05:06,720
Okay so same reason as before we're going to get rid of the linear regression part for this.

75

00:05:06,720  -->  00:05:07,770
So here we go.

76

00:05:07,810  -->  00:05:08,530
Goodbye.

77

00:05:08,730  -->  00:05:12,810
And now we are only left with the polynomial regression prediction.

78

00:05:13,080  -->  00:05:14,310
Okay great.

79

00:05:14,310  -->  00:05:16,590
And so now we just need to change something here.

80

00:05:16,590  -->  00:05:22,730
Well first it's the name of the aggressor because for the name of our pulling them your regression regressors

81

00:05:22,790  -->  00:05:24,410
was called POLLI rag.

82

00:05:24,580  -->  00:05:29,350
And now since we won't make the distinction between a linear regression model and our nominee our regression

83

00:05:29,350  -->  00:05:32,780
model Well our aggressor will be called regressors.

84

00:05:33,160  -->  00:05:34,700
So here we aggressor.

85

00:05:34,960  -->  00:05:41,650
And here you know for polynomial regression we need to input the polynomial features of our data frame

86

00:05:41,740  -->  00:05:43,640
that we created in our data frame.

87

00:05:43,780  -->  00:05:50,620
Well we won't need to do this for the next nonlinear models because this is strictly specific to the

88

00:05:50,620  -->  00:05:54,780
polynomial regression model where you know we need to add those polynomial features.

89

00:05:55,060  -->  00:05:59,510
And so we will get rid of this and we'll get something very simple.

90

00:05:59,590  -->  00:06:08,500
It's actually this line that will perfectly predict the salary of the 6.5 position level because in

91

00:06:08,500  -->  00:06:13,790
our future non linear regression models there won't be those polynomial features in the data sets to

92

00:06:13,900  -->  00:06:21,640
only need the original independent variable here and especially the 6.5 value of this independent variable

93

00:06:21,660  -->  00:06:21,870
.

94

00:06:22,060  -->  00:06:25,670
So that's why we have everything we need with this simple line.

95

00:06:25,870  -->  00:06:26,760
Okay great.

96

00:06:26,920  -->  00:06:34,330
And now the last thing that I'm going to do is maybe to take this code section here cuts and I'm actually

97

00:06:34,330  -->  00:06:40,960
going to place it between the creation of the model and the visualization because I like to keep the

98

00:06:40,960  -->  00:06:47,380
best for the end and for me the best part the most exciting part is the part where we visualize our

99

00:06:47,470  -->  00:06:48,230
results.

100

00:06:48,280  -->  00:06:54,190
And for a second reason is that we know that's our problem is not in their problem and that therefore

101

00:06:54,190  -->  00:06:55,990
we need a non-linear or aggressor.

102

00:06:55,990  -->  00:06:58,010
And we were definitely already convinced of that.

103

00:06:58,030  -->  00:07:03,730
That's why we don't need to execute this code section before this one to convince ourselves that we

104

00:07:03,730  -->  00:07:06,560
need indeed and not in a regression model.

105

00:07:06,610  -->  00:07:12,130
So therefore for the next regression models will make the prediction before visualizing the results

106

00:07:12,130  -->  00:07:12,490
.

107

00:07:12,490  -->  00:07:14,580
And that's why I'm putting that here first.

108

00:07:14,860  -->  00:07:15,210
OK.

109

00:07:15,220  -->  00:07:17,310
So I think the template is ready now.

110

00:07:17,380  -->  00:07:24,070
Well maybe we need to change the polynomial here to generalize the template as much as possible.

111

00:07:24,090  -->  00:07:26,250
So will replace polynomial here by.

112

00:07:26,410  -->  00:07:29,670
Well actually let's just put predicting in your result.

113

00:07:29,770  -->  00:07:30,490
All right.

114

00:07:30,490  -->  00:07:36,460
And here we can replace a polynomial regression by regression model.

115

00:07:36,520  -->  00:07:41,500
All right and now just to finish just one plate for those of you who are also interested in getting

116

00:07:41,590  -->  00:07:44,320
a smoother curve and your regression model results.

117

00:07:44,410  -->  00:07:49,190
Well there is this trick we can do to increase the resolution and we are going to do that right now

118

00:07:49,190  -->  00:07:49,210
.

119

00:07:49,210  -->  00:07:52,770
So it's just an optional code section that I'm adding here in this template.

120

00:07:52,810  -->  00:07:56,770
I'm going to copy this because we will have just a few things to change.

121

00:07:57,010  -->  00:08:01,900
And you know for those of you who really want a very smooth curve when you visualize a regression model

122

00:08:01,920  -->  00:08:04,810
results well you can use the following code.

123

00:08:04,810  -->  00:08:09,550
So the trick is to actually create a new sequence of levels.

124

00:08:09,550  -->  00:08:14,530
That means that when we are predicting only 10 salaries of the 10 levels well which we're going to do

125

00:08:14,530  -->  00:08:20,320
now in this section is that instead of predicting only 10 salaries of 10 levels we're going to predict

126

00:08:20,320  -->  00:08:27,010
a lot more than 10 levels and to do that we will build a vector of imaginary levels that will actually

127

00:08:27,010  -->  00:08:30,960
be levels from 1 to 10 incremented by 0.1.

128

00:08:31,060  -->  00:08:40,330
So that means I will consider level 1 level 1.1 1.2 1.3 up to 9.6 9:27 nine point eight and nine point

129

00:08:40,330  -->  00:08:40,860
nine.

130

00:08:41,050  -->  00:08:46,660
So that's what we will create in the sequence and therefore here instead of predicting only 10 salary's

131

00:08:46,990  -->  00:08:51,250
we will predict actually 90 salaries of 90 levels.

132

00:08:51,250  -->  00:08:52,270
So that's the trick.

133

00:08:52,300  -->  00:08:58,690
And to build this sequence it's actually very simple we are going to call the sequence x grid you know

134

00:08:58,990  -->  00:09:05,560
because X grid will replace data set dollar level here and data set here and this X grid is going to

135

00:09:05,560  -->  00:09:10,540
be defined as SEC which is a function that builds a sequence.

136

00:09:10,870  -->  00:09:14,360
And so in this function we need to input three parameters.

137

00:09:14,470  -->  00:09:16,190
The lower bound of your sequence.

138

00:09:16,190  -->  00:09:23,560
So that's actually men data set level because by doing this are taking the minimum of all the levels

139

00:09:23,560  -->  00:09:25,390
in your original dataset.

140

00:09:25,400  -->  00:09:31,240
All right then the next parameter is the upper bounds of your levels that is level 10.

141

00:09:31,450  -->  00:09:36,840
And therefore we do the same with the max here Max data set dollar level.

142

00:09:36,870  -->  00:09:37,570
All right.

143

00:09:37,720  -->  00:09:39,580
And the third parameter is the step.

144

00:09:39,580  -->  00:09:44,830
So that's where we increase the resolution and make our fitting curve smoother because here we're going

145

00:09:44,830  -->  00:09:52,000
to take a step of 0.1 and therefore 90 levels will be created here from 1 to 10 incremented by 0.1.

146

00:09:52,000  -->  00:09:52,350
All right.

147

00:09:52,360  -->  00:09:57,760
That's actually done and now we need to replace data set dollar level here that originally took the

148

00:09:57,760  -->  00:09:59,380
10 levels of our dataset.

149

00:09:59,410  -->  00:10:08,530
So we are replacing that by X grid and same here we need to replace data set here by a new data frame

150

00:10:08,530  -->  00:10:13,290
because you know this new data argument here is expecting a data frame here.

151

00:10:13,300  -->  00:10:18,400
So we can not replace it directly by ex-secret here because X grid is not a data frame it's a sequence

152

00:10:18,490  -->  00:10:19,920
that is a vector.

153

00:10:20,080  -->  00:10:23,110
So what we need to do here is use this little trick again.

154

00:10:23,290  -->  00:10:31,000
It's quite simple to use this data frame data Daut frame comment here that will actually create a data

155

00:10:31,000  -->  00:10:37,080
frame and in parenthesis we're going to specify that we want to create a data frame of new levels.

156

00:10:37,150  -->  00:10:43,420
So I'm taking the voidable level here and then equals and that's where you put ex-secret because you

157

00:10:43,420  -->  00:10:50,860
know by doing this data frame level equals x grid we are just creating a new column of levels containing

158

00:10:50,920  -->  00:10:55,600
all the levels in this sequence x execrate here levels and that's it.

159

00:10:55,660  -->  00:11:01,240
This new code section is ready to plot your regression model result in a higher resolution and actually

160

00:11:01,240  -->  00:11:09,220
we're going to specify here that it's for higher resolution and smooth curve.

161

00:11:09,220  -->  00:11:09,610
All right.

162

00:11:09,640  -->  00:11:14,080
And that's actually ready so you can try it on either you know you're pulling on your regression model

163

00:11:14,080  -->  00:11:19,090
that we made in the section or you can use it on the future non-linear regression models that we're

164

00:11:19,090  -->  00:11:23,600
about to build and you will see the difference between these two.

165

00:11:23,630  -->  00:11:28,450
Then if you want a more simple code you can use this one or if you have for example a dataset with a

166

00:11:28,450  -->  00:11:33,890
hundred observations incremented by one then this is the code you need to execute because then you wouldn't

167

00:11:33,890  -->  00:11:37,940
need a number on one step to build your different points of your fitting curve.

168

00:11:38,230  -->  00:11:40,180
All right so now the template is ready.

169

00:11:40,230  -->  00:11:45,870
We are actually ready to use it for the next nonlinear regression models that we're about to build.

170

00:11:46,030  -->  00:11:50,980
We'll do that in the next sections and you're going to see how it will be so efficient at building them

171

00:11:50,980  -->  00:11:51,040
.

172

00:11:51,040  -->  00:11:53,350
So I look forward to creating this model with you.

173

00:11:53,410  -->  00:11:58,650
It's going to be very fun and we will make them in the most efficient way and machine early.
