00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,470
Hello and welcome to this art Tauriel.

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:08,220
So in the previous two tours we imported the dataset and we started with the big first step of natural

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,070
language processing which is about cleaning the text.

4
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:12,490
We are working with.

5
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:18,300
So this first step consisted of creating a corpus that basically is a new data set.

6
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:22,050
Design only containing the reviews the text of the reviews.

7
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:27,210
And basically this is in this corpus that we going to clean all the 1000 reviews and we are going to

8
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:28,380
clean them Step-By-Step.

9
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,790
And in this tutorial we're going to do the first cleaning step.

10
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:32,160
All right.

11
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:38,580
So let's do it this first cleaning step will consist of putting all the reviews in lowercase s and what

12
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:39,980
is the purpose of doing that.

13
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:46,010
Well we are doing this or that in the final sparse matrix containing all the words of our 1000 reviews.

14
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:51,120
We don't get why the same word you know with one word starting with a capital letter and the same word

15
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:53,260
but not starting with a capital letter.

16
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:58,110
And of course we only want to have one version of the same word and therefore will keep the one with

17
00:00:58,330 --> 00:00:59,290
lowercase.

18
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:04,560
So that's why right now in this first step of the clearing process we will put all the words of our

19
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,440
1000 reviews in lower cases.

20
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,490
So let's do it.

21
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:15,800
To do this we are going to update the corpus this way than equals because we are updating it.

22
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:21,310
That is it will contain new reviews which are going to be the same reviews but with lower cases.

23
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:28,380
And to put all the words of the reviews in this corpus we will use the T and underscore that function

24
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,390
that will do the job for us.

25
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:36,480
So functions that we need to add some parenthesis and then we need to add two parameters the first parameter

26
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,200
is actually the corpus itself.

27
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:45,090
But you know the old version of the Corbett's that is the corpus that we have here which contains the

28
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:51,720
original versions of the reviews there is 1000 reviews we have in our data set and this corpus here

29
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:57,480
will be the new updated version of the corpus that is the corpus containing all the reviews in lower

30
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,340
cases.

31
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:00,300
So that's the first parameter.

32
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:06,900
The old version of the corpus and the second parameter is a function that is some kind of a transform

33
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:12,390
function and that will simply transform each word of the corpus by replacing the capital letters in

34
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:13,310
lowercase.

35
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:16,830
So this function is content underscore transformer.

36
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:17,430
Here it is.

37
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:24,150
Let's press enter here and actually this content transform function can perform several transformations

38
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,910
as we can see in the yellow rectangle here.

39
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:29,040
The parameter of this function is fun.

40
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:35,880
And so we need to add the function that we want to put all the words of the reviews those cases and

41
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,790
this function is called to lower.

42
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:39,570
All right.

43
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:44,900
So that's the function parameter that we need to input in this content transform.

44
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:51,030
Which is like a transform function having several transformation possibilities as input here and the

45
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:56,650
possibility that we choose is this too long a function which will put all the words in more cases.

46
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:02,300
And basically this team that function is used so that we can apply this content transform into lower

47
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:06,350
function for all the words of the 1000 reviews of the corpus.

48
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:06,740
Great.

49
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:08,730
So that's actually done.

50
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:13,530
That's actually all we need to put all the words of the 1000 reviews in more cases.

51
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:16,100
So I'm going to show you now what it does.

52
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:23,250
So what we'll do before selecting this and executing this what we'll do is have a look at you know one

53
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,910
review of the Corvis at stake.

54
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:30,550
The first review and then we'll run this line of code and you'll see what it does to this first review.

55
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:37,380
OK so let's access to the first review and to do this we need to use the as that character and then

56
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:40,140
in parenthesis we end the corpus.

57
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:45,510
But then since we want to look at the first review of this corpus Well we need to add some double brackets

58
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:51,500
actually and one because this is the index of the first review because indexes are start at 1.

59
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,610
So this way we will have a look at the first review.

60
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:58,770
And you know since the corpus is kind of a complicated object we need to use these double brackets here

61
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:00,880
to access to the written review.

62
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:06,790
And besides we need to use this as character function to have this written review displayed.

63
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:07,720
All right.

64
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:13,550
So I'm going to press enter here and as I just told you we get the written review.

65
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,080
Wow.

66
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:19,160
Love this place which is of course the first review as we can see in our dataset.

67
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:19,670
Wow.

68
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:21,050
Love this place.

69
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:21,320
All right.

70
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:24,760
So that's the first review that's the original version of the first review.

71
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:30,150
And now we are going to apply the first step of the cleaning process which is to put all the reviews

72
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:31,130
and cases.

73
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:35,200
So let's do it let's select this line and executes.

74
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:36,090
All right.

75
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:41,630
So as you can see it was very fast all the 1000 reviews were just transformed in a lot of cases.

76
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,870
So let's check it out.

77
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:44,690
Let's check it out for the first review.

78
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:52,140
So we just need to you know press the up arrow to get the previous command which is this one.

79
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:58,350
And you know since our new corpus is also called Corpus We just updated the corpus Well we can run this

80
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:03,450
and hopefully we'll get get the same review written in lower cases.

81
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:04,400
So let's check it out.

82
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:07,840
Let's press enter here and here we go.

83
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:15,990
As you can see the capital W became this little W and this capital L became this lower out perfect.

84
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:23,100
So first simplification now in the final big table the final sparse matrix we won't get two versions

85
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:28,470
of the same word one in capital letter and one in lowercase will get one unique version of the word

86
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:33,340
and therefore we did the first simplification of our future sparse matrix.

87
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:34,870
So that's a first good thing done.

88
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:40,410
And now we will proceed to the next step of the cleaning process which will be to remove all the numbers

89
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:46,230
of the reviews because indeed the numbers are not very relevant in telling you for review is positive

90
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,030
or negative.

91
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:52,740
Well we need to be cautious actually because maybe some reviews are you know on a scale of 1 to 10 I

92
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:53,610
give a 10.

93
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:58,500
Well that's definitely a number that is fully correlated to the outcome whether the review is positive

94
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,350
or negative.

95
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:04,410
So we should pay attention to that but we could have other numbers that are totally irrelevant like

96
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:09,390
you know some addresses that contain numbers or phone numbers well that would be a little weird in the

97
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:11,110
review but we never know.

98
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:16,020
Well in general when we are dealing with text when we're working with text we want to get rid of the

99
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:19,360
numbers because these are most of the time not very relevant.

100
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:21,540
And you know this could add a lot more columns.

101
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:24,170
So in general it's better to remove the numbers.

102
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:26,250
So that's what we'll do in the next tutorial.

103
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,890
And until then in Germany learning
