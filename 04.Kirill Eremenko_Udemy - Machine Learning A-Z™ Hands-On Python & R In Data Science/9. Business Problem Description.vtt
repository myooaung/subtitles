00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:01.090
Ok off we go.

2
00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:06.960
So this data says it's got a few columns he's got row number customer id surname.

3
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.090
So what we're looking at is a data set of a bank.

4
00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:13.520
Of course it's all fictional.

5
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.470
It's not a real bank but it's very realistic.

6
00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:22.980
And here we've got a snapshot of if you scroll down to the bottom is going to be 10000 customers.

7
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:32.410
So 10000 start a said and what the bank did is they measured some things about these customers right.

8
00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:35.310
Why did why did they undergo this whole thing and what's the challenge.

9
00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:39.380
Well the bank has been seeing unusual churn rates.

10
00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:45.730
So churn is when people leave the company and they've seen customers leaving at unusually high rates

11
00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.320
and they want to understand what the problem is and they want to assess and address that problem.

12
00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:57.080
And that's why they've hired you to look into this data set for them and give them some insights.

13
00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.010
And how did this dataset come to be.

14
00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.470
Well six months ago the bank said all right there's a big problem.

15
00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:09.850
We've got to take a sample of our customers by the way this is a sample that 10000 is a tiny number

16
00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:10.530
for this bank.

17
00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.010
This bank has millions of customers it operates.

18
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:21.370
This fictional bank operates in Europe in three countries France France Spain and Germany and they have

19
00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:27.850
lots and lots of customers so what they did is they took this sample of 10000 customers and they measured

20
00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:33.730
six months ago everything they knew about them they are customer id their surname credit score their

21
00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:40.780
geography their gender their age their 10 years so how long they've been with the bank the balance of

22
00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.520
the customers at that point in time the number of products they had at that point in time.

23
00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.170
So a number approaches things like how many products do they have to have a savings account have a credit

24
00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.030
card do they have a loan.

25
00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:55.500
Did the customer have a credit card or not.

26
00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:01.240
So there's no yes no flag is the customer an active member and other Snowflower active member can be

27
00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.620
measured differently by different organizations.

28
00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.410
It could be whether or not the customer logged into their online banking in the past month whether they

29
00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:16.420
did a transaction in the past two months or some other measurement like that and estimated salary so

30
00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.380
the bank doesn't know the salary of the customers but based on the other things they know they could

31
00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.180
estimate a salary for that customer and they also gave you this information.

32
00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.000
So six months ago they measured all of these things and said All right.

33
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.510
So for these 10000 are randomly selected customers are we going to just watch them so we just going

34
00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:40.410
to wait six months and six months on the track we're going to check who those customers left and who

35
00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:41.680
those customers state.

36
00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.930
And that's what this column exited or presents here.

37
00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.400
It tells you whether or not the person left the bank within those six months.

38
00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.250
So this person over here sometime within the six months he left the bank.

39
00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.600
And as of a couple of days ago he's no longer with the bank.

40
00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.520
This personal We're here on the other hand is still in the bank.

41
00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:00.550
So there's a Zuri here.

42
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.360
This person left the bank this person stayed and so on.

43
00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.640
So if you see one that means the person is no longer the bank is that person still the bank and your

44
00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:15.490
goal is to create a job demographic segmentation model to tell the bank which of their customers are

45
00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:17.710
at highest risk of leaving.

46
00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:22.810
What I wanted to mention today is that for a lot of customer centric organization this is going to be

47
00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:30.400
valuable so I've done this personally I've done this so many times it is such a value add to any customer

48
00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:31.480
centric organization.

49
00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.300
So whenever whenever an organization deals with customers this is a lot of value.

50
00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:42.400
And then the other thing is that this skill that you're going to learn is very transferable.

51
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.290
It doesn't have to be for a bank.

52
00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:51.670
It doesn't have to be for churn rates just demographics segmentation models can be applied to millions

53
00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:58.900
of scenarios so here for instance even in a bank the same scenario could work should the person get

54
00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:00.910
a loan or not.

55
00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.760
Should the person be approved for credit or not.

56
00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:05.560
And once again you'd have a binary outcome.

57
00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:11.620
So based on prior experience you would know whether or not a person is reliable and you'd build a model

58
00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:17.040
and say which people are more likely to be reliable and which people are more likely to default.

59
00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.210
And that could govern the bank's decision on whether or not to give loans.

60
00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:26.080
This could be in terms of fraudulent transactions not even in a bank in a different financial institutions

61
00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:31.850
you could find out which transactions are more likely to be fraudulent which are less likely.

62
00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:38.470
There's lots of scenarios where you could apply a demographic segmentation and it doesn't even have

63
00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:39.710
to be demographic.

64
00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:46.110
So whenever you have a scenario when you have a binary outcome and you have lots of independent variables

65
00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:51.460
you can build a proper robust and that will tell you which factors influence the outcome.

66
00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:57.520
So you can apply this knowledge is going to learn in any kind of scenario where you have a binary outcome

67
00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.350
and lots of independent variables
