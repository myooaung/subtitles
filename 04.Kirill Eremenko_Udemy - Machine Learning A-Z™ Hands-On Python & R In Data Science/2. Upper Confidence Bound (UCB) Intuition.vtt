00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.180
Hello and welcome back to the course on machine learning.

2
00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:09.570
Today we're talking about the upper confidence bound and the intuition behind this algorithm of the

3
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.440
reinforcement branch of machine learning.

4
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:13.740
So let's get started.

5
00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:19.890
As we discussed previously the problem we're solving is a multi armed bandit problem where you've got

6
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:27.120
five or more or any number of slot machines and you can bet your money in any one of them and you need

7
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:33.260
to find out how to bet to maximize your returns.

8
00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:40.380
And basically we agreed that behind every machine there is a certain distribution and that's because

9
00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:46.770
you don't know which of these distributions is optimal You need to combine exploration of these machines

10
00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:53.820
with their exploitation in order to find out which one of these machines is the best and then you can

11
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.460
start exploiting that one.

12
00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.910
And the modern application of this problem is of course advertising.

13
00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.560
So if you have five or 10 or 15 or 500 different ads.

14
00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.540
How did you find out which one is the best one.

15
00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.270
Of course you can run just an A B test and then use the results of that.

16
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.690
But that means you're doing exploration and then you do an exploitation.

17
00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.620
Separately you're going to include lots of costs you're going to incur you're going to waste a lot of

18
00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:20.580
time.

19
00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:27.240
We want to combine exploration exploitation and get to the optimal result as soon as we can and maximize

20
00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.330
the output of our efforts.

21
00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.660
All right.

22
00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:36.120
So this is a quick summary of the multi-hour by the problem.

23
00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.260
So let's go through this very quickly so we can get to the fun stuff.

24
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:45.450
So we have deep arms for example arms our ads that we display each time a user comes to our Web page

25
00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:53.070
if someone ad is displayed or a user visits this page that's around for each round and we choose which

26
00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.070
ad to display.

27
00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:00.100
You can only display one ad like with the one armed bandits you can only pull one of those arms and

28
00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.820
is one machine to bet on each round.

29
00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:13.230
And as I gives a reward whether it's a or a 1 and basically are I of and of and is equal to one if the

30
00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.030
user clicks on the add and zero if you didn't.

31
00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.400
These are different and I'll go some actual total reward.

32
00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.030
We get over them in here and so that's basically what we are doing.

33
00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.880
And this is how the upper confidence bond algorithm works.

34
00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:32.790
And I won't go into too much detail on this because I actually had lunch is going to run you through

35
00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:40.110
this and you you're going to code this from scratch in R and you can code this also in python in the

36
00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.010
following lectures of course so we're not going to waste spend time on this we're actually going to

37
00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.900
get to the essence of the algorithm.

38
00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:46.170
Right.

39
00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.050
So let's get to the intuition part which is how does it work.

40
00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.480
What's actually happening in the background when this algorithm is running.

41
00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.380
All right so let's have a look.

42
00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:04.530
These are our slot machines or one arm bandits and they each one of them has a distribution behind it.

43
00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.790
We want to find the best one right looking at them we can tell which one it is.

44
00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.500
But let's see we do not.

45
00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.970
Let's see we know the end result.

46
00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.410
Just for argument's sake what would it look like.

47
00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:19.950
Well this is for instance in this case the distribute these are the distributions behind those machines

48
00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.010
you've got you know the machine.

49
00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.030
This is how they're spitting out the results with these distributions.

50
00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.930
And just by looking at this you can you can tell right away which one is the best machine.

51
00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:36.690
Which one would you bet your money on constantly if you were playing in this one right.

52
00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:43.680
So right away here you can see that this one has the best return and you would want to just come all

53
00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.330
the time just bet on this one and your outcome would be best.

54
00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:48.780
But we don't know that right.

55
00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.130
We don't know that.

56
00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:56.610
And we want to find that out in the process of playing these machines of or using those ads that were

57
00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.900
running and find out you know which one is getting the most clicks.

58
00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:08.850
We don't want to we don't have the time and money to do that exploration before the actual campaign

59
00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:09.180
is running.

60
00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:14.060
We want to do that in the process want to maximize our return already from the very start.

61
00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:14.940
So how do we do that.

62
00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:21.330
Well let's transfer these traditions are the actual expected return from the distributions onto a vertical

63
00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:27.090
axis so we're going to take these values and we're going to put them onto a vertical axis or here so

64
00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:28.490
there's a vertical axis.

65
00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.610
So for distribution one let's say the value is there for distribution to.

66
00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:38.910
There was a value we could remember it was lower distribution 3 even lower for higher five 5 the best.

67
00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:39.240
Right.

68
00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:47.100
So those are the expected values or returns for each of those distribution for each machine that's why

69
00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.280
r y axis.

70
00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:52.040
But again we don't know that so what how does this Hougan work.

71
00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.550
Well it assumes some starting point for every distribution.

72
00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:02.330
It just assumes that there is a certain starting value that let's just assume that because we can distinguish

73
00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.090
we can't discriminate against these machines in any way.

74
00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:06.190
They all look the same.

75
00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:10.330
Let's assume that they all have the same return and let's put it on that level.

76
00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:20.510
Now then what the algorithm does is those formulas that are behind algorithm they create a confidence

77
00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:21.020
band.

78
00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:29.960
And it is designed in such a way that we have a very high level of certainty that confidence bad will

79
00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:37.730
include the actual will include the actual return or the actual expected return.

80
00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:43.470
So basically the first couple of rounds are going to be trial runs.

81
00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:49.970
So we're going to intentionally just try out the machines at least one time each in order for us to

82
00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:55.750
be able to place this value here and come up with a confidence band who is going to be very large at

83
00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:56.930
The rest are it's very large.

84
00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:05.230
But it is designed specifically in a way that the expected value which is this one over here we have

85
00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:11.690
very high level of confidence falls inside this confidence level with a very high degree of certainty

86
00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:19.190
for inside this confidence band which is built around this red empirical value which we have derived

87
00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:21.570
and the very start it's all the same right so.

88
00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:24.050
And then how does this algorithm work well out of all of them.

89
00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:27.660
We pick the machine with the highest confidence.

90
00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:32.120
But right now it can be any of these machines right they all have the same confidence but that we're

91
00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.090
talking about the upper confidence ball.

92
00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:37.560
That's why the algorithms called Upper confidence bounce.

93
00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:40.990
And so we're going to pick any one of them because it doesn't matter which one you pick.

94
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.520
Again we don't know these blue these color lines.

95
00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:44.330
We don't know about them.

96
00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:53.630
All we see as as agent or as the person analyzing this we only see these boxes and old they're all identical

97
00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:55.940
to us so we just pick any you want them to pick this one.

98
00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:01.820
So what happens next is we actually pull that lever over that machine and something happens or we place

99
00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:02.510
that ad right.

100
00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:04.580
So we display that ad next.

101
00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:08.320
And we want to see did the person click on it or did the person not click on it.

102
00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:12.920
And in this case the person didn't click on it.

103
00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:20.510
Right so it went this red value goes down because it's well now we have another observation just for

104
00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:25.740
this machine that is added to the whole sample of observations for this machine.

105
00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:34.460
And the value goes down because we'll all always the read value is like the observed average the observed

106
00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:39.680
average is going to according to law of large numbers is always going to be in the long run is going

107
00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:51.220
to converge to the expected expected return or expected average or expected value for this distribution.

108
00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:56.270
So therefore it is very likely that this value is going to go down.

109
00:07:56.450 --> 00:08:03.440
And now because we have an extra observation the second thing happens is the confidence bonds confidence

110
00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:03.750
in.

111
00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:09.290
Will you see that confidence interval become smaller simply because we have an additional duration of

112
00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:10.700
course does it become that much smaller.

113
00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:16.550
But this is just to illustrate a point because we have an additional observation we are more confident

114
00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:17.690
in our predictions.

115
00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:19.830
We are more confident in everything that's going on.

116
00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:24.100
So the confidence interval slowly starts to shrink.

117
00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:24.350
All right.

118
00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:28.170
So the next step is now we find the next one with the highest conference bond.

119
00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:31.550
So obviously on this one it's one of these for just picking a random one.

120
00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:32.110
There we go.

121
00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:34.580
This one do the same thing.

122
00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:40.630
So again ad is displayed a person either clicks or doesn't click.

123
00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:46.070
And that affects the average that we've measured so far the empirical average or you've you've pulled

124
00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:51.590
the lever you've got CRN you know you're either one or you lost and that affects your empirical averages

125
00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:58.730
red line and as expected it slowly starts to converge over like lots of iterations it'll start to converge

126
00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:01.860
to the to the expected value.

127
00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:07.820
So it comes closer and right away you can see now this machine is all of a sudden above all of the other

128
00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:08.470
machines right.

129
00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:14.360
So if this was the end of this iteration that's it we we would assume from here that this is the best

130
00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:18.860
machine and would start exploiting it and therefore this algorithm would be completely useless.

131
00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:25.010
But we shouldn't forget about the second thing that happens the second thing that happens is that because

132
00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:32.930
we got an additional observation in our sample now we are more confident in this interval and these

133
00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:34.970
confidence bonds they're designed.

134
00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:42.230
Their only purpose is to include the actual expected value wherever it is.

135
00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:48.410
We don't know where it is but they are they are telling us that this value is Greenvale somewhere inside

136
00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:53.110
this box but because we've got an additional observation we're more confident our sample size is larger.

137
00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:56.950
So we're more confident in the overall picture for this machine.

138
00:09:56.990 --> 00:10:03.130
So the confidence bounds decrease and now as you can see it's no longer the top machine because even

139
00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:05.200
though it went up the confidence bonds went down.

140
00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:08.520
So now we're going to look for the next highest conference bond.

141
00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:13.780
It can be any one of these three machines and just look at any one randomly for now.

142
00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:16.720
This one and here.

143
00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:19.570
Even though the red line is above the blue line.

144
00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:23.900
So according to the law large numbers you'd expect this to converge to that.

145
00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:27.940
But sometimes it can randomly occur that it can go the other way.

146
00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:28.450
Right.

147
00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:29.910
Things can happen like this.

148
00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:31.290
It's all probabilities.

149
00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:34.310
So basically it might even go up.

150
00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:38.870
So we're going to end up even though the blue line was below the red line.

151
00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:44.820
It can happen as a you know like as a just as in per chance right.

152
00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:46.110
In the long run it will converge.

153
00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:48.370
But on a random occasion it can go up.

154
00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:50.170
It can go in any way.

155
00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:51.900
And again we've got another.

156
00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.040
Another element in the sample.

157
00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:57.100
So the confidence balance converges.

158
00:10:57.130 --> 00:10:57.390
OK.

159
00:10:57.410 --> 00:11:00.160
So can we kind of get the picture of what's going on here.

160
00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:06.070
So now we're going to pick the next one of the highest up reconfigurable and let's say this one then

161
00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:08.830
we do the trial we do the rounds.

162
00:11:08.830 --> 00:11:12.820
What happens is a person can do we win money from the slot machine.

163
00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:14.800
And it goes down.

164
00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:16.030
Probably not.

165
00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:20.320
We didn't didn't click on the ad and went from money for the slot slot machine.

166
00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:27.720
So the average of observation goes down comes closer to the expected value and the conference bonds

167
00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:28.470
also decrease.

168
00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:29.070
OK.

169
00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:33.850
Now we kind of when our in business we can all of them are kind of starting to play.

170
00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:35.070
Next one is this one.

171
00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:35.340
OK.

172
00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:38.440
This is the now because we know the end result.

173
00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:39.910
We know that this is the best one right.

174
00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:45.570
We know that this is the best ad or this is the best machine we should be using but like because we

175
00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:51.630
we were kind of like given this insight just for argument's sake or for the purpose of this exercise.

176
00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:57.520
But the person that's reforming this algorithm all the algorithms doesn't know that so unknowingly it's

177
00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:01.700
actually starting to exploit the best option right now.

178
00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:03.790
So again ok goes up.

179
00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:06.100
Good call his ban goes down.

180
00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:07.990
And as you can see it's still the best one.

181
00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:10.210
All right so now we're going to do it again.

182
00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:15.820
We're going to use this one again and it comes closer and the confidence ballon goes down again this

183
00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:21.190
is all just full illustration purposes of course it's not going to go down by that Maij just because

184
00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:21.930
one observation.

185
00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:26.500
But we don't want to be sitting here through a thousand iterations this is just to demonstrate the overall

186
00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:26.830
picture.

187
00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:33.110
So even though we exploited the best option by exploiting the best option we're decreasing the conference

188
00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:39.250
on which gives an opportunity or Breakstone any option if it goes if it keeps going up because it keeps

189
00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:43.630
being good because we're building up the sample size.

190
00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:47.330
This gives an option to the other.

191
00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:53.230
It gives opportunity to the other options to or machines or ads to have a chance in the play so that

192
00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:58.150
we're not just you know we we're not biased towards which one we think is the best or optimal outcome

193
00:12:58.940 --> 00:12:59.930
optimal machine.

194
00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:04.510
So now we move onto this one same thing comes closer.

195
00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:05.680
Decrease.

196
00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:14.200
We want to this one vast increase and we move on to this one and does increase and then again this one

197
00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:15.760
the crease.

198
00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:22.750
And again this one much closer has increased and even though we were very close to finding the solution

199
00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:27.730
at Sarwan bonds the bonds decreased so much and you actually see this in the practical application and

200
00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:36.070
practical Torahs are following that sometimes we will after using the optimal option for some time we'll

201
00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:40.690
switch the Algor will still switch to a suboptimal option just because the balls are decreasing all

202
00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:41.320
the time.

203
00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:46.270
And then we'll use this one as will decrease and now we're back to the best one on the increase.

204
00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:51.010
And then we're just going to be exploiting this one and exploiting this one and exploiting this one

205
00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:53.530
because we found out that it's the best one.

206
00:13:53.650 --> 00:14:02.520
So that is in essence the whole concept behind this opera confidence bar algorithm and that's how it

207
00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:06.610
solves the multi unbandaged problem.

208
00:14:06.950 --> 00:14:12.850
It's it's a very interesting solution much more sophisticated and then just selecting randomly or running

209
00:14:12.850 --> 00:14:18.300
an A B test and then selecting the option you know that that one.

210
00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:24.310
So you know if you're in advertising or if you've got campaigns or if you come across problems that

211
00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:30.130
are similar to this always just remember about pre-conference barn argument you can apply this in your

212
00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:31.010
work as well.

213
00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:32.680
Very powerful algorithm.

214
00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:38.190
And on that note I hope you enjoyed today's tutorial in the next couple of videos Halonen will take

215
00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:44.490
you through the programming of this algorithm both in our and in Python and you'll get your takeaway

216
00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:51.040
templates and I can't wait to see you next time where we'll be talking about the Thomson sampling algorithm.

217
00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:53.020
And until then in Germany learning.
