00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,870
Hello and welcome to this art tutorial.

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:07,550
So we did a big part of the calling process we started by creating this corpus here.

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:13,290
Then we put all the words in lowercase us then we removed all the numbers all the punctuation and we

4
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:15,740
also removed all the non-relevant words.

5
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:20,540
And finally we took the roots of all the words in the 1000 reviews.

6
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:24,170
So all these steps considerably simplified the words and the reviews.

7
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,440
So thanks to all the steps here all these simplifications.

8
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:32,350
Well our final sparse matrix of features will get a much smaller number of columns.

9
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,570
So that's good for our algorithm because it reduces sparsity.

10
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:42,180
And now we have one final little step to do that will not be done to simplify it even more the corpus.

11
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:47,860
But that just consists of removing the extra spaces because by doing all these simplifications here

12
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:54,060
well you know we remove some things and those things that were removed could actually have been replaced

13
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:58,620
by a space and that would cause extra space in the review.

14
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:04,920
And therefore if we want to have perfectly clean reviews we must remove these extra spaces if we remove

15
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:10,230
all the extra spaces where all the columns in our final sparse matrix of features will only contain

16
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:14,580
the worst that are relevant and will not contain any space or anything else.

17
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:18,430
So that's what we'll remove in this final step of the cleaning process.

18
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:24,150
So let's do it again it's going to be very simple will copy this line here.

19
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:31,710
Copy and pasted below and replace stemed document here by strip whitespace.

20
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:37,410
Here it is pressing enter and all good final step ready to be executed.

21
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:41,710
And therefore the whole cleaning process is ready to be completed.

22
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:47,360
So before we execute this line let's have a look at a review that now has an extra space.

23
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:54,300
I remember that when we removed the number in the review 841 Well we got an extra space.

24
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,040
Here it is.

25
00:01:55,170 --> 00:02:00,500
You know before the review was for 40 bucks ahead I really expect better food.

26
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:06,460
And when we applied the remove numbers here to the Corpus Well the number 40 here disappeared.

27
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:12,060
But it actually didn't disappear was just replaced by this extra space here because indeed we can see

28
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:15,510
that we have two spaces between four and bucks.

29
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:18,090
And what we want to get is only one space here.

30
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:21,670
So we're just removing the extra space here so let's check it out.

31
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:28,410
When we select this final line of code of our cleaning process well let's make sure that this extra

32
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:32,850
space in the 841 disappears this time for good.

33
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:35,920
All right so I'm going to press commenter's enter to execute.

34
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:36,790
Here we go.

35
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:39,030
And now let's have a look at the review.

36
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:43,210
841 So let's president of error here to find it.

37
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:48,640
Here it is we're going to get the new version of the review 841.

38
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:52,360
After we applied this strip whitespace to the corpus.

39
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,770
So let's do it press and comment here.

40
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,130
Well not only that space was removed we can see that we don't have any extra space here but also we

41
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:05,500
get all the other steps of the cleaning process since indeed we can clearly see that the non-relevant

42
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,800
words were removed.

43
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:10,110
So the non-relevant words where for example four.

44
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,470
So this was removed and then a.

45
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,760
I think that's all.

46
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:16,930
Yes.

47
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:21,200
As you can see a was removed here and I was removed here.

48
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:23,530
OK so that's the first thing we see very clearly.

49
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:29,110
And the second thing we see very clearly is the stemming of course because we hardly recognize the words

50
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:29,680
here.

51
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:32,010
Box was replaced by Buck.

52
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:38,320
No it's not only about the past tense of verbs it's also about the singular and plural of nouns.

53
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:46,030
So Buck's became black and head was not replaced because the root of head is head.

54
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:48,930
So that's why we kept head here.

55
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:54,970
And then really really the Y became really with an eye.

56
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:57,620
So that's how are simply interpreting the route.

57
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,260
So that's OK.

58
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:59,250
It's not a mistake.

59
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:05,170
And finally I expect better in food were not replaced because you know these are kind of already the

60
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:06,160
roots of the words.

61
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:09,340
And we cannot really simplify the words more.

62
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:12,610
All right so that's a good example we can clearly see what happened here.

63
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:16,290
And for what we just did here was the strip wide space.

64
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,990
We can see that this extra space here was removed.

65
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:24,750
Well there is still a space here but you know before there was the four and two spaces between four

66
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:25,370
and Buck.

67
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,480
And then after the upward step the four was removed.

68
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:33,680
So we can still see a space here before buck but that's actually one space instead of two.

69
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:39,040
If we want to get even more convinced where we can see that we have next space here between love and

70
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,590
place.

71
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:45,670
This review is the first review in the previous version of the corpus before we applied the strip whitespace

72
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:46,290
here.

73
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:51,430
And so now I will see that if we have a look at the first review of the new version of our Kobus Well

74
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:57,370
this extra space here will be removed and we will get only one space between love and place instead

75
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:59,800
of two hear that check it out.

76
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:05,050
Here we go we can clearly see that we have only one space here instead of two spaces here.

77
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:05,370
All right.

78
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:06,050
So good.

79
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:11,420
Removing the extra spaces worked properly and so we are done with the cleaning process.

80
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:12,450
So great.

81
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:17,050
That means that now we are ready to build the sparse matrix of features.

82
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:18,730
We'll do that in the next tutorial.

83
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:20,570
And until then enjoy mission early
