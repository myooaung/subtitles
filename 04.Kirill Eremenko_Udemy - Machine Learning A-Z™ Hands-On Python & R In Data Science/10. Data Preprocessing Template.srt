00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:05,550
Hello and welcome to the final tutorial of Part 1 data repossessing.

2
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:12,370
We finally completed all the steps that there is to do to prepare any data set on which we will build

3
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:13,810
our machine learning morals.

4
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:19,630
And now what we only need to do left is to prepare a data processing template because we learned a few

5
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:19,980
stuff.

6
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:26,560
We learned how to import a data set to take care of missing data to encode categorical data to split

7
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:32,230
the data set into the training set and the test set and to apply feature killing to put all of our variable

8
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:33,510
on the same scale.

9
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,620
However in the data processing template we're not going to include all of these.

10
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:41,070
We're only going to include the importing the libraries.

11
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:45,130
Then of course you need to import the data set then regarding missing data.

12
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:49,810
I just wanted to show you how to take care of that in case you have some missing data in your data set.

13
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:54,790
You know in your work so we're not going to include this in the templates it's just good to know how

14
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:58,630
to take care of this but then we will focus on the machine learning models themselves.

15
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:04,630
And if in your work experience you encounter missing data you know how to handle this any missing data

16
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:05,770
issues.

17
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:07,410
Then ask for categorical data.

18
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:13,180
We won't include it either in the template because we are going to find very few examples of data where

19
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:15,340
we have to encode the data.

20
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:20,330
There will be some examples but we won't include it in the templates because our data sets are going

21
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:26,090
to be well-prepared so that we can mainly focus on the machine learning models and get the maximum fine.

22
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:31,270
And then of course we will include this in a template splitting the data sets into the training set

23
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:34,420
and the test set because that's a very important step.

24
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:40,540
You need to split your data set between training and test because you need to evaluate your model on

25
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:45,730
a different set than the set on which you build your model and feature scaling.

26
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:51,580
Okay So Fitch's scaling I hesitated to include it in the template but we are going to include it only

27
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:56,830
we're going to put that as comment because you're gonna see that there are several libraries and are

28
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:03,480
in Python and some of them require us to apply features getting to the data and some of them don't.

29
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,600
So most of them don't actually.

30
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:07,690
Most of them take care of that for you.

31
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:12,980
You don't have to do it manually but you will see that some libraries don't apply the feature scaling.

32
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:18,280
I won't tell you which models there are right now because I will let you find out the surprise but keep

33
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:22,710
that in mind and you will see that sometimes you will have to use feature scaling.

34
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:23,000
Okay.

35
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:25,960
So let's start making the template it's going to be very quick.

36
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:28,750
Let's do it right now let's jump to r All right.

37
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:33,180
So here is all the steps that we did together so importing the data sets.

38
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:36,990
Yes we're keeping it of course taking care of missing data.

39
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:40,420
That was just to show you we won't need it in the future so.

40
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,780
But you will probably need it in your future.

41
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:45,280
But in the future of this course we will need it.

42
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:48,730
So we will remove it coding categorical data.

43
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:49,590
Same here.

44
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:54,700
We will have to do it once or twice but not all the time so we will remove it.

45
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:59,800
And as I told you I am putting this in a separate file so that you can still use it if you need it for

46
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,330
your work.

47
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,100
All right.

48
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,140
And now I think we have everything splitting the data set into the training set and to set of course

49
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:12,660
we are keeping that and feature scaling feature scaling.

50
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:19,510
As per Python we are going to put that in comment so then the three double quotes is not a way to put

51
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:22,890
multiplying comments in r so unfortunately we cannot do it.

52
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,520
What we need to do is this is a good trick.

53
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:34,450
You select the two lines here and then you press command and control plus shift plus C and that puts

54
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:41,530
all your lines in comment and eventually will just add a final touch to this template which is the case

55
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:44,490
where we need to take a subset of our data set.

56
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:49,370
And in that case we will add the line data set equals.

57
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:57,700
Then we take the same data set and we use the square brackets to select the indexes of the columns we

58
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,560
are interested in to build our model.

59
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,720
So let's just put some numbers here.

60
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:08,570
And if we need to select specific columns of interest in our future data sets we will change those indexes.

61
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,590
But for now let's just put this line in comment.

62
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:14,220
All right.

63
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:15,040
All right.

64
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:17,980
So the template is really on our as well.

65
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:20,200
We are ready to start our machine learning models.

66
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,420
You have no idea how I'm excited about that.

67
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:25,040
I can't wait to show you how it's gonna be a lot of fun.

68
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,880
We're gonna make awesome predictions.

69
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,440
You know we will.

70
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:32,500
We will have some kind of scenarios business problems and we will have to solve them and we will use

71
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,060
the power of machine learning to solve these problems.

72
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:38,050
You will see how machinery is powerful.

73
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:40,980
It gives you amazing predictions amazing results.

74
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:45,160
And keep in mind you will never be lost because we will always know what we are coding.

75
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,870
We will always visualize it.

76
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:52,900
There will always be some visual graphics of what we are doing when we make every machine learning model.

77
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,230
So I can't wait to start this with you.

78
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,340
This was the boring part but a very important part to do so.

79
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,460
That's great that we did it and now it's time to have fun.

80
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:05,380
So thank you for watching this data processing tutorials.

81
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:08,090
Congratulations for completing this part.

82
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,220
You are now ready to make machine learning models.

83
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:13,140
And I look forward to seeing you in the next part.

84
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:14,880
Until then enjoy machine learning.
