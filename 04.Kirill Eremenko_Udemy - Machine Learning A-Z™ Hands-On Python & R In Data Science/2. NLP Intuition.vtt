Hello and welcome back to The Machine Learning.

2
00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:09.090
It is, of course, a super excited to have you back here on board for this new part on natural language

3
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:16.200
processing in this quick tutorial will go over what is coming up for us in terms of the intuition of

4
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.840
videos to better understand natural language processing.

5
00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:25.500
So first thing that I want to mention is that the upcoming videos that you will see are actually taken

6
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.080
from a specialized course that we have in the space of natural language processing is called Deep Learning

7
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.610
and an LP A to Z.

8
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:39.450
And why I'm saying that is you will hear references to things like deep learning or sector sic models

9
00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:40.740
and other things.

10
00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:48.300
So I wanted to clarify what is important to us in this specific part of the course and what needs to

11
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:48.930
be disregarded.

12
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.960
So let's have a look in this section.

13
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:53.340
Here is what we'll be focusing on.

14
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:58.080
So we will have a tutorial on types of natural language processing.

15
00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.270
So we'll discuss all different sorts of types.

16
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:06.300
And I think that's a great way to become aware of what exists in the world of natural language pushing,

17
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.940
processing, even if it includes the deep learning models or even the more advanced sectors like model.

18
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.920
So you'll hear those terms.

19
00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:21.030
But our focus here will be on a different type of national energy program, one which will come up just

20
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.270
now.

21
00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:29.030
Then you'll actually have a we'll have a tutorial on classical versus deep learning models and we'll

22
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.500
discuss the differences between them and different kind of usages and some some examples as well.

23
00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.460
Again, to increase our awareness of the space of national language processing.

24
00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.150
And finally, we'll have a tutorial specifically dedicated to the bag of words model.

25
00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:49.770
So that is the main tutorial that we need to be focusing on, because that's the model that you will

26
00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:50.370
be building.

27
00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:56.760
Together, we've had lunch in the practical tutorials and we'll get the intuition behind bag of words

28
00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.740
in this in this tutorial.

29
00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:06.000
And just so that we're on the same page in this part or in this course on machine learning it, that

30
00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:12.060
we're not going to be talking about the sector sake model or chat boards or deep national language processing.

31
00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.860
Those are more advanced topics.

32
00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.690
If you'd like to discover them and take your national language processing skills further after this

33
00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.540
section, of course, you can always have a look.

34
00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:26.850
And we invite you to have a look at our course that was mentioned just before.

35
00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.850
Deep learning and natural language processing.

36
00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:30.450
A to Z.

37
00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.130
And you can find a lot of those things there.

38
00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:38.730
But even these this awareness of national language processing and this bag of words model and the practical

39
00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:44.900
applications that you'll be discussing online is going to be a great start into the world of A.P. and

40
00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:51.300
will allow you to practice certain skills of pooling text apart and getting insights from text.

41
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:52.290
Very exciting.

42
00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:53.220
To Terrill's coming up.

43
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.000
Can't wait for you to get started with this part of the course.

44
00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.970
So if I'd followed you, let's dive straight into it.

45
00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.190
And until next, I'm happy analyzing.
