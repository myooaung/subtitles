1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,850
Hello my friends all right here we are at the final very exciting step of this implementation where

2
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:11,300
we visualize the results so we're going to clearly visualize the rules and see for each of them you

3
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:14,060
know their support their confidence and their lift.

4
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:19,110
And mostly we're gonna see which are gonna be the best deals by one product and get another one for

5
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:19,410
free.

6
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:25,800
We'll clearly see which food goes well with some other food for these French people in the south of

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:26,630
France.

8
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:28,390
Okay so let's do this.

9
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:33,930
We already have the rules here which were the output of this primary function so you will see that it

10
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:36,540
will be very simple to display them.

11
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:43,350
Therefore Let's select that cell in order to create a new code sale just below and indeed in order to

12
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:49,110
have a first look at these rules well we simply need to create a new horrible which we're going to call

13
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:49,760
results.

14
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:54,490
You know the results of this primary model which are nothing else in the world but see what I'm gonna

15
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:55,230
do.

16
00:00:55,230 --> 00:01:03,480
I'm going to set this results variable as a list of the rules which will just put these rules into a

17
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,230
list right.

18
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:10,680
As simple as that we just want to have our rules into a list so that then when we display the results

19
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:16,680
you know by just calling this variable and executing this cell indeed we will get in the output.

20
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:22,200
All our rules in this list you recognize the square brackets here and at the end as well.

21
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:22,440
All right.

22
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:27,640
So all these rules are listed one by one you know in different rows.

23
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:27,990
All right.

24
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:28,680
So there you go.

25
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:34,680
These are all the rules you know all the rules following these criteria a minimum supportive or point

26
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,590
three percent minimum conference of open to a minimum list of three.

27
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,520
And of course two products in the rules you know one on the left and one on the right.

28
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:43,760
All right.

29
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,140
So let's have a look at them one by one starting with the first ones.

30
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,690
That's the first rule here.

31
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:50,010
And what do we see.

32
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,160
Well I'm just going to highlight it.

33
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:54,010
All right.

34
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,430
So that's the first rule.

35
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:55,680
All right.

36
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:02,720
So let's see first we see that the two products in this rule are like cream and chicken but be careful.

37
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:06,550
The order is not if customers buy like cream then they will buy chicken.

38
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:08,390
No it's actually the other way around.

39
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,880
Because indeed if we are cruel to the right.

40
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:18,870
Well that's important you see items Baz is equal to like cream and then items add is equal to chicken.

41
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:24,180
So that means that actually the left hand side of the rule is like cream and the right hand side of

42
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,880
the rule is chicken.

43
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:26,440
OK.

44
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:32,400
So that means that if people buy like cream then they will have a high chance to buy chicken and that

45
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,440
high chance is actually measured by the conference which is open 29 here.

46
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:42,990
So that means that if customers buy like cream then they will have 29 percent chance of buying chicken

47
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:44,460
which makes sense right.

48
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:50,430
Well at least in France because usually French people love to put some nice light cream with lemon as

49
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:52,170
a source for their chicken.

50
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:52,440
Right.

51
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,780
It's a common traditional French meal.

52
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,930
I actually really enjoyed myself.

53
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:57,300
All right.

54
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,410
And then we can also see the lift which is a very good one.

55
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:01,620
Four point eighty four.

56
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:07,830
I remind that all our rules here will have lift larger than three and then whereas the support the support

57
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:11,910
is right here the support is open Oh forty five.

58
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:19,250
Meaning that the rule containing these two products appears in open forty five percent of the transactions.

59
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,790
All right then let's see what we have.

60
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:24,020
So the second one Eskil up motion cream sauce.

61
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:31,800
But same the items Baz is mushroom cream sauce and the items add is escrow meaning that if customers

62
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:37,440
buy mushroom cream sauce and they will have a high chance of buying Escalade and that high chance is

63
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:43,140
30 percent right 30 percent and lift is three point seventy nine three point eight.

64
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:46,740
And the support is open 0 5.

65
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:47,900
OK good.

66
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:49,340
So you see you have all these rules.

67
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:55,470
They look great but we would actually appreciate a nice way to have a look at them because here you

68
00:03:55,470 --> 00:04:01,090
see we have to do these crawls to the right and therefore it's a bit overwhelming so don't worry.

69
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:07,620
I actually found a good code snippet online I think was from Stack Overflow or another source like that.

70
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:14,580
So we're going to use that code snippet to actually put the results well organised into a this data

71
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:15,190
frame.

72
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:20,640
We won't have to re implement that code snippet from scratch because you know it is very specific to

73
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:26,200
this association rule learning implementation and therefore you will just see that once in your life.

74
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:31,950
So it's not essential and therefore we'll just copy and paste it here from our original implementation

75
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:35,070
but of course I will explain to you the code.

76
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:36,300
So let's get it first.

77
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:40,170
It's actually at the bottom and it is this one.

78
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:40,950
All right.

79
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:48,080
We make an inspect function which will return the rules meaning these rules well organized into this

80
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:54,540
data frame and the cool thing about this is that we will even be able to sort the rules by a descending

81
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:55,530
metric.

82
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:55,770
Right.

83
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:57,030
Because if we notice here.

84
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,830
Well they're not sorted.

85
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:04,410
You know the lift start at four point eighty four then goes down to three point seventy nine and then

86
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,050
goes back up to four point seven.

87
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,820
And here five point sixteen.

88
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:14,280
And remember that the lift is actually the most relevant metric to measure the strength of a rule you

89
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:14,490
know.

90
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:19,350
So if we want to store the rule you know to get the strongest one if we want to you know select a few

91
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:20,010
deals.

92
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,540
Well we would rather do it with the lift.

93
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,070
So what will be really nice here.

94
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:29,130
You know when putting these results into a well organized pendants data frame is that then we will be

95
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:33,650
able to sort easily the rules by the lift or another metric.

96
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:36,170
All right so let's get this function.

97
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:46,000
I'm going to copy it here and we will paste it inside are implementation right here there we go.

98
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,830
Paste.

99
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:49,000
And now let me explain to you how it works.

100
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:54,520
So as we can see it is a function that takes as input the results meaning these results.

101
00:05:54,520 --> 00:06:00,410
The rules as they are right now you know organized this way and then it will take separately.

102
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:05,230
The left hand side of the room and in the product at the left hand side the rule then the product at

103
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:11,380
the right hand side of the rule then the support of all the rules then the competences the lives of

104
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:12,310
these rules.

105
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:16,230
And then it will return all the rules with the left hand side and the right hand side.

106
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:20,040
And there are supports confidences and lived inside the list right.

107
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:22,260
That's why we have this list function here again.

108
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:22,680
All right.

109
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:24,690
So that's what this inspect function will do.

110
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:30,760
And then at the end we create the final Panda's data frame which takes as input the output of this inspect

111
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,530
function.

112
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:36,220
And besides we add the column names you know the first column will be the left hand side of the rule.

113
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:39,040
The second column will be the right hand side of the rule.

114
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:42,330
The third column will be the support for the confidence.

115
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:43,650
And finally the lift.

116
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:50,170
So we will have a super nice table with these columns and giving all the important informations for

117
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:51,580
each of the rules.

118
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:51,840
OK.

119
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:54,190
So that will be super practical.

120
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:57,840
And now let me explain how you know we get each of these elements.

121
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,620
You know the left hand side and then the right hand side.

122
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:01,870
All right.

123
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:08,080
So the first thing to notice is that for loop inside a single row indeed we take the full list of all

124
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:08,820
the rules here.

125
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:15,140
You know that the full list of results and then for each of the rule in this full list of rules.

126
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,260
Well we're going to access each of these elements and take them separately.

127
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:21,430
And so let's start with left hand side.

128
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:27,250
How do we take that left hand side which is you know right here the items base frozen set like cream

129
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,690
basically light cream.

130
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:29,890
Well let's see.

131
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:35,230
So first we take the single rule you know let's say for example this one to explain how we're going

132
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:36,310
to get these elements.

133
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:41,080
So we take these rules and then in this rule we first access the index too.

134
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:41,360
All right.

135
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:43,050
So let's axis it step by step.

136
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:49,310
This element here you know up to the comma is the element of index 0.

137
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:54,660
Okay then this element is the element of index 1.

138
00:07:54,670 --> 00:08:01,720
This is a second element and then this fool element you know up to the closing square brackets here

139
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:05,220
is actually the element of index 2.

140
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:05,440
All right.

141
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,290
So all I've highlighted here is the elements of index.

142
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:14,230
So now in that element of index 2 then we're going to access the element of index 0 meaning the first

143
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:18,000
element and the first element is actually the first element of that list.

144
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:24,930
You know in square brackets and that is of course all this you know ordered statistic up to be careful

145
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:27,880
you know up to the closing parenthesis here.

146
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,730
Meaning right here.

147
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:37,420
So all this is the first element inside that you know big element which I've just highlighted before

148
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:41,580
you know from all statistics up to actually the end.

149
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,860
All right so this is the element of index 0.

150
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:51,080
And then in this new element of index 0 we're going to access the first element of index 0 again.

151
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:57,710
And well you know we have to look inside this parenthesis and that's of course this element which is

152
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:59,790
indeed the left hand side.

153
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,090
Right.

154
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:04,330
Because this is what we want to get left inside item space.

155
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:05,160
That's the same.

156
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,580
And that is light cream.

157
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,100
And then for the right hand side that's the same.

158
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:16,210
You know we took the same first element of next to then that whole element of index zero inside this

159
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:17,880
first element of the next two.

160
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:25,810
And then instead of taking the index zero here we take the index 1 which is that element items add frozen

161
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:27,360
set chicken.

162
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:28,140
All right.

163
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:31,530
So that element is you know that element of next to then zero.

164
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:36,420
Then next one and then that index is to indeed catch what's inside you know chicken.

165
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:41,260
And same for that index zero here there was to catch light cream.

166
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:46,180
All right so you see we just play with the indexes to assess what we want but really you will only have

167
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,410
to do that once in your lives.

168
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:52,510
Don't worry too much about this kind of overwhelming code even if it's quite funny to you know follow

169
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:57,730
the indexes path to find the products but then the good news is that for the support is going to be

170
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:59,520
much simpler indeed.

171
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:05,800
We just need to take the full rule you know the single rule so you know this whole rule and then very

172
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:09,270
simply we access that element of index 1 directly.

173
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:16,290
So remember this full single rule well all this is the element of index 0.

174
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:22,540
And then all this is the element of index 1 and that's exactly the support which is what we want and

175
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:26,580
we do this for each of the rules in this whole list of rules.

176
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:27,260
Okay.

177
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:33,790
Then confidences once again it's a bit more complicated but just like before for us we get the element

178
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,630
of index too.

179
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:36,250
So let's take it again.

180
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:44,320
This is the element of index 0 then this is the element of the next one and then all this is the element

181
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:46,120
of index 2.

182
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:46,790
Okay.

183
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:49,220
Then inside this whole element of index 2.

184
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:55,790
Well we're going to access the element of index 0 which is let's take it again so we start from here

185
00:10:55,850 --> 00:11:03,080
in the ordered statistic and then we go up to actually the closing parenthesis of here which should

186
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,080
be right here right.

187
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,770
Let's check the parenthesis here.

188
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:09,000
That's the first opening one.

189
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:11,370
Then the second opening one closing here.

190
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:15,620
Then this is a new opening one closing here and then there you go.

191
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:15,880
Okay.

192
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:22,230
So that's the closing parenthesis of indeed this element of index 2 then index 0.

193
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:23,550
And then inside this element.

194
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:27,240
Now we're going to get access to the element of index 2.

195
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:34,460
So that's the element of index 0 then that's the element of index 1.

196
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:37,410
And then finally that's the element of index.

197
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:40,950
And that's exactly the confidence which is what we want to get right now.

198
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:42,250
And then same for the lift.

199
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:48,770
So same same path for us we get access to the index to then zero so just like we were right now but

200
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:54,500
then instead of taking the index to like for the confidence we take the next one which is the index

201
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,500
3 and which corresponds to of course the left.

202
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,070
All right.

203
00:11:58,070 --> 00:11:59,470
And that's how we get the lift.

204
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:06,200
So you see the idea just a game with the index is we assess the elements inside this whole complicated

205
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:11,780
list of rules but at least we will get a nice result in the end and really you don't have to worry too

206
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:17,810
much about this code is very unique very specific and you will probably not have to re-employment it

207
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:23,390
again in your life you can just take it you know I just took it online and indeed it is very practical

208
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:27,150
for what we're doing right now meaning association with learning.

209
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:27,510
Okay.

210
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:28,430
So good.

211
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:31,270
Now let's have a look at the beautiful result.

212
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:38,030
So we are going to play the cell first to you know build that inspect function and then create that

213
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:44,630
new data frame which I called results in data frame and which will contain the same rules here but better

214
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:47,950
organized and more beautifully organized let's say.

215
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:54,930
And so now we're going to create a new Kotel here just before this tech sell to first display the results

216
00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:03,650
non sorted and to do this well we simply to call what we created here meaning results in data frame.

217
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:04,500
All right.

218
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:11,220
And then when pressing play you will see that we will get a very nice table containing all the rules

219
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,440
with the different elements in separate columns.

220
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:17,060
So that's the left hand side of the rule the right hand side of the rule.

221
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:20,760
And then the support of the rule the confidence of the rule and the lift of the rule.

222
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:24,740
So let's have a look at the rules one by one for the first one as we saw earlier.

223
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:31,490
If customers buy light cream then they will have actually twenty nine percent chance of buying chicken.

224
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:32,040
All right.

225
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:37,560
And this rule appears open four percent of the time you're not an open four percent of the transactions

226
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:41,860
and it has left a four point eighty four which is indeed very good.

227
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:47,010
Then the second rule if people buy mushroom cream sauce then they have a good chance at buying Asciano

228
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:52,110
and that good chance is 30 percent and it has a lift of three point seventy nine.

229
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:53,330
Pretty good still.

230
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:58,810
Then if people buy pasta then they will have a good chance of buying escalate up and that good chance

231
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:03,720
is actually pretty good indeed if customers buy pasta then they will have 30 percent chance of buying

232
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06,390
scallop and the lift is four point seven.

233
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:09,670
Then check this out we have a good lift here for from us one honey.

234
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:13,400
Yes of course from us on honey is a delicious French dessert.

235
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:17,150
I actually really enjoyed that dessert is one of my favorites.

236
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:22,770
And indeed when you buy from each block as a French person you will definitely enjoy putting some honey

237
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:23,460
on it.

238
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:29,040
All right so indeed that's a great rule and I would definitely make this deal you know buy from Hezbollah

239
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:35,040
and get honey for free right because indeed the lift is five point sixteen so very very good.

240
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,960
Then Herb and pepper ground beef.

241
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:42,450
Yes of course French people or even you know other people from other nationalities love to put Herb

242
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,640
and pepper on ground beef this is actually exquisite.

243
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:50,480
And indeed we have a good confidence for that rule and actually well not that high of olives.

244
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,210
OK.

245
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,890
Then same for tomato sauce.

246
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:55,930
It's nice to put tomato sauce on ground beef.

247
00:14:56,040 --> 00:15:00,120
The lift is still close to four light cream olive oil.

248
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,100
Well I don't really see that association but why not.

249
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:08,730
I'm not really a good cook but maybe there is a recipe where we can combine olive oil and light cream

250
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,070
not so sure about that.

251
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:15,930
But however this one is definitely something I would do whenever I buy whole wheat pasta.

252
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:21,030
I also get olive oil and indeed the left is pretty high and then passed and shrimps.

253
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:26,760
Yes that's a very good specialty of South of France especially near the coast French people of course

254
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:31,000
love mixing bass and shrimps all right and the left is 4.5.

255
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:31,700
So very good.

256
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:38,610
You see these are much better to observe but then we still don't have them solid which here is fine

257
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:43,680
because you know we don't have that many rules but in other situations you can end up with many more

258
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:48,810
rules and therefore you would like to sort them for example by descending lift because the lift is a

259
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:50,270
very relevant measure.

260
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:55,110
So I'm going to show you right now how to do this is very very simple things bend.

261
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:57,030
So let's create a new coat sail.

262
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:59,010
And here we're going to take again.

263
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:05,490
Well our new beautiful data frame results in data frame and now we're going to use a pre-built function

264
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:12,270
by the library to indeed sort the results of this data frame by a specific column which we're of course

265
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:13,950
going to specify here.

266
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:15,180
All right so let's do this.

267
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:20,280
To do this we need to add a dot here because we're going to call a specific method of the data frame

268
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:26,960
class you know because this results in data frame is actually an object of the data frame class by pendants.

269
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:30,710
And that method is called and largest.

270
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:37,230
There we go this one and inside we just have to enter three arguments as we can see here you know you

271
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:42,600
have all the info thanks to Google collapse of the three parameters are first and which has a number

272
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,090
of rows we want to return.

273
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:50,280
So I'll just put that as you know if I was doing a coat on plate I'll just put an equals 10 to you know

274
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:56,650
in general return the 10 best rules to an equals 10 then keep we will keep the default values you know

275
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:59,560
that's in case we have duplicates but that's fine for us.

276
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:02,340
I actually checked them and then columns.

277
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:02,550
All right.

278
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:07,920
So that's the other parameter I want to input here and that's of course you know to specify by which

279
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,400
column you want to have your results sorted.

280
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:17,050
All right so columns equals and well you know the most rather than metric is perhaps to lift.

281
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:23,100
So we're going to sort these rules by the left and to do this well we simply need to specify the lift

282
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:26,610
value in quotes for that columns parameter.

283
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,070
So in quote I'm going to enter here lift.

284
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:30,900
All right.

285
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:31,680
And that's it.

286
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:36,950
This is simply what you have to do in order to sort your rules by the column you want here.

287
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:40,160
Lift if you want to order them by conference which is also great.

288
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:43,230
You would just specify here in quotes confidence.

289
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:43,490
All right.

290
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,220
Let's try.

291
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:46,280
Let's play this cell.

292
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,080
And there we go.

293
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:52,050
Now we have indeed two rules sorted by the lift.

294
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:58,700
This is the highest lift five point sixteen down to the lowest lift three point eleven.

295
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:04,070
And so let's see well as I told you you know that very popular association especially for French people

296
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:06,460
they love to put honey in French Hezbollah.

297
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:10,130
Any time you go to a French restaurant you will see in the dessert menu.

298
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:14,200
Well from along with honey and even if you don't see it you can always ask the restaurant.

299
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,100
They always have honey not too far.

300
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:19,270
So that's definitely a very strong rule here.

301
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:25,190
And you know if I was the owner of the shop I would definitely make that deal buy from my blog and get

302
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:26,280
honey for free.

303
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:26,940
Then same.

304
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:30,200
This is the second strongest rule like cream chicken.

305
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:34,560
So another great deal would be if you buy like cream you will get chicken for free.

306
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:36,230
That's actually a very good deal.

307
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:42,350
But you know as I told you the owner can put some smart prices that you know would amount to a good

308
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:46,250
price for you know buying the two right but that's another story here we're doing.

309
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:49,190
Association rule not pricing strategy.

310
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:49,700
So there we go.

311
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,100
Let's move on to the next rule.

312
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:55,790
If people buy pasta then they will enjoy buying Escalade as well.

313
00:18:55,910 --> 00:19:02,240
So a third great deal would be buy pasta and get as close for free and then same with best and shrimp.

314
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,930
Of course if you buy pasta you can get shrimps for free.

315
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:09,440
Then if you buy whole wheat pasta you can get olive oil for free.

316
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:16,310
You know these deals will be very attractive to the customers because indeed customers buy these association

317
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:16,940
of products.

318
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:17,920
OK.

319
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:18,410
All right.

320
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:19,170
There you go.

321
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:22,250
These rules you know for most of them actually makes sense.

322
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,390
And there you go my friends.

323
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:24,520
Congratulations.

324
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:31,430
You built your first association rule learning model to identify clear rules that will create some added

325
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:33,530
value to a retail business.

326
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:34,720
So your job is done.

327
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:40,580
Now you can enjoy the beautiful days of South of France after completing successfully this new data

328
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:41,290
science mission.
