00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.030
Welcome back to your machine learning.

2
00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.120
Aid is at course.

3
00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.310
In this tutorial I'd like to give you a quick heads up about the non-linear Support Vector regression.

4
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.780
So what we discussed previously was intuition for SVR indeed.

5
00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.820
But this was intuition of the linear Support Vector regression model.

6
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.620
And while it's a great start into the world of SVR it is just the start.

7
00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.770
There is so much more to support vector regression.

8
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.230
This was a simple linear model.

9
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.120
There are actually other models.

10
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.690
And the rest assured they will be covered in this course.

11
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:43.350
So they are coming up and we'll be talking about for instance the RPF Colonel SVR and the colonel trick

12
00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.290
and all these important things that make this a model even more robust.

13
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.180
However I wanted to give you this heads up because already in upcoming Python tutorials that are coming

14
00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:00.150
right after you just following this tutorial on the section you'll be working off had lunch to create

15
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:05.940
your first SVR model and the SVR model will already be non-linear.

16
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:11.790
So here you can see the results like I've blurred them out on purpose because I wanted not to.

17
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:17.490
I have wanted to make sure you don't get a spoiler by seeing the results in terms of the numbers but

18
00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:23.190
you can see the model itself here and you can see that it's non-linear so just a straight line.

19
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:31.130
And that is because we're using or at will be showing you how to use the radial basis function kernel

20
00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.420
for this as we are.

21
00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.750
So it's really going to be a nonlinear as we are.

22
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.590
So now what's the reason for the heads up.

23
00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:45.300
Well the thing is that the non-linear Support Vector regression will be called off further down the

24
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.700
course beyond this section.

25
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.950
So it's a bit of a mismatch but that's done on purpose because that's the easier way to grasp these

26
00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.500
concepts and I'll explain in this falling slide.

27
00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.460
So this is what we can prove.

28
00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.740
This is what the nonlinear SVR will look like.

29
00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.930
Right.

30
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.810
So compared to this this is the linear model as you can see is much more complex over here we have to

31
00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.830
go into a third dimension and perform some calculations or some modelling there and go back.

32
00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.190
So it is quite involved.

33
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:19.950
And in order to get there the following tutorials are essential so first in the section on SVM you'll

34
00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.030
find it difficult SVM intuition.

35
00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:27.560
So that's an essential tutorial to take in the steps to getting to.

36
00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:35.700
Colonel SVR or nonlinear SVR then in the section on Colonel SVM the following section you can find them

37
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.510
in the part of the chorus that has to do with classification.

38
00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.890
So in the section on Colonel SVM there's a tool called Colonel instrumentation.

39
00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.060
Then there's a mapping to a higher dimension.

40
00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.460
The colonel trick types of Colonel function.

41
00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:53.970
And then finally non linear Colonel SVR says you can see is quite a complex topics topic and it comes

42
00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.880
at the very end of this list.

43
00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:02.220
So from here you have two choices You can either just after this tutorials go straight to at lunch Python

44
00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:08.460
tutorials on Col on the SVR there that are coming up and just do them and just keep in mind that he

45
00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.740
is using a nonlinear kernel and that will come later in the course the intuition for it will come later

46
00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:14.390
in of course.

47
00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:20.670
Or if you would like to get the intuition before you do the practical side of things then it's essential

48
00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.320
that you would need to go through all of these stories that are mentioned on this slide over here get

49
00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.300
to non-linear chronology and then come back to the Python turns.

50
00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:29.960
So there are two options.

51
00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:35.030
My preference if you ask me I would just go for lunch Python to turtles now just keep in mind that he

52
00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:40.440
is using a nonlinear kernel for along with the code and then you will still get the intuition when the

53
00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.820
time is right when you get to the section on kernel Israel.

54
00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.960
So we go.

55
00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.200
That's just a quick heads up on the what's coming up.

56
00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.390
Of course the choice is yours and in any case please enjoy the course.

57
00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:55.560
And there's lots of fun tutorials coming up and I look forward seeing an excellent Until then happy

58
00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:56.100
analyzing.
