00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.810
Hello and welcome back to the course and machine learning today we will finally find out about the colonel

2
00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:06.360
trick.

3
00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.370
So let's get started.

4
00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:14.220
So here we got the Galveston or the radial basis function kernel and those are two interchangeable terms.

5
00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.460
And now let's have a look at this function.

6
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:24.660
So K stands for kernel and it's the function function applied to two vectors.

7
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:31.450
The X Factor so this is a just a some sort of point in our dataset and Al stands for Landmark.

8
00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.770
I mean there might be several landmarks but we're going to we're not going to worry about either.

9
00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:44.040
For now we're just going to look at this as a landmark and then that equals to an exponent in the power

10
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:51.810
of minus the the double vertical lines mean the distance between X and the landmark squared divided

11
00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:53.410
by two sigma squared.

12
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.490
So I know this might all seem very confusing right now and you're probably wondering.

13
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.210
Carol this makes no sense whatsoever.

14
00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.010
What does this even mean.

15
00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.750
Well let's explore this through a visual example.

16
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:16.680
So here I've got an image which represents this particular function for a specific Sigma for a specific

17
00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:17.530
landmark.

18
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.540
But this is what it looks like in a.

19
00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:23.670
When you visualize it.

20
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:31.410
And so what's happening here is we've got al the Landmark is actually in the middle of this plane.

21
00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.400
So in the middle of this two dimensional space.

22
00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.030
Let's imagine this is the X corner.

23
00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:42.680
This is the y coordinate in the middle we've got 00 and that's where the Landmark is actually located.

24
00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:50.520
And then the vertical here the vertical axis represents the result that we get when we calculate this

25
00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:59.270
for every other point on this x y axis on this x y field or plane.

26
00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:05.640
If we take any other point than this the results of this calculation so let's say we put that point

27
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:11.040
in here and then recalculate the distance to the landmark and then we square it divided by two sigma

28
00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:15.020
squared where sigma is some fixed parameter that we decided upon earlier.

29
00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.050
Then we take the negative of that and then we put the exponent into that power.

30
00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.960
Then we get this resolved that's what it will look like.

31
00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:30.750
So let's go through this step by step let's look at the tip of this observation is right in the middle

32
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.880
of this whole x y plane.

33
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:41.790
And so if you project that it back onto the plane and the bottom you'll have the kernel that's that

34
00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.280
or not the kernel that's the landmark.

35
00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:50.340
We're going to call it the landmark that's where the middle of this bottom square is and that's from

36
00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.010
where we're measuring the distance.

37
00:02:53.010 --> 00:03:00.710
So k this distance x minus l i this distance every squaring here will be measured from that landmark.

38
00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.880
So let's take a point and look at it.

39
00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.570
So there is a point somewhere on our plane.

40
00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.910
It's quite far away from the landmark.

41
00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:09.980
There is a distance.

42
00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.930
So we're taking that distance.

43
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.170
We're squaring the distance dividing it by two sigma squared.

44
00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.130
Taking negative and then we want to see what the result will be.

45
00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:26.730
And so how can we confirm that this visualization is actually indeed aligned with this formula.

46
00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.530
So it's pretty simple.

47
00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:30.020
The distance here.

48
00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.940
Let's assume it's quite large right.

49
00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.550
So it's quite a large distance compared to some other points that are closer to the landmark.

50
00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:39.890
So basically the distance here is a large number.

51
00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:48.030
And if we take a large number and we square it's right we get an even larger number and then we divide

52
00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.510
by two sigma squared it's still assuming it's still a large number.

53
00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:56.880
Again depends on the Sigma and we'll find out what the role of sigma for the done in this tutorial.

54
00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.400
But assuming this is still a very large number.

55
00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:04.250
So you've got a very large number here and then you sing my negative.

56
00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:11.230
You're making a negative very large but negative numbers so if you take an exponent as you put it into

57
00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.330
a power of very negative a very large negative number.

58
00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.770
So each of the power of one let's say minus a million.

59
00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:19.510
Right.

60
00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:25.500
And just for argument's sake or minus a thousand What does that give us that gives us a value.

61
00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:26.730
Very close to zero.

62
00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:32.640
So it's is basically equivalent to saying 1 divided by E to the power of 1000.

63
00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:40.460
And that is a very very small number so that basically means when you're far away from the Landmark

64
00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:47.040
or from the center you get pretty much zero on the vertical axis which lies before image here.

65
00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:52.860
Now let's have a look at another example so this point is actually closer to the landmark.

66
00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.560
And here if we measure the distance it's quite small.

67
00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:00.290
So now if you take a small number you square it and you still have a small number divided by square

68
00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:08.220
you still have a small number so you look at the power of minus a small number so let's say e to a power

69
00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:09.400
of minus.

70
00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:19.740
I don't know like a point or each of the power of minus one for example or each of the pyo part of mine

71
00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.850
is 0 0 0 point 1.

72
00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:23.750
So that basically means.

73
00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:26.010
So this number is close to zero.

74
00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:31.770
It's as you get closer to the landmark then this number gets closer to zero.

75
00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:39.330
So and we know that each to the power of minus zero minus zero point zero one zero point 0 0 0 1 and

76
00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:40.000
so on.

77
00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:46.280
Basically as you get close to zero E2 we get closer to E to the power of zero.

78
00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.010
And each of the power of 0 is 1.

79
00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:55.150
So basically as you get closer to your landmark this number here this number here gets smaller as well

80
00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:55.790
as more.

81
00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:59.280
And this whole right partner here converges to one.

82
00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:04.260
So it becomes bigger bigger bigger and bigger and you climb this hill up to the top where you get to

83
00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:06.990
one in the very landmark itself.

84
00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:11.730
So when you exactly hit on the latter you hit landmark do you get to the top.

85
00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:19.140
And so that is just a quick way of checking that this image is indeed the kernel function that we're

86
00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:20.000
looking at.

87
00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:23.910
And what is this all useful why do we need this.

88
00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:32.430
Well because we're going to use this kernel function to separate our data set to build that decision

89
00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:37.220
boundary so let's have a look there is our two dimensional space.

90
00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:37.720
Right.

91
00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:39.920
And there's our x1 x2.

92
00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:41.880
Just like we had here x1 x2.

93
00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:49.890
And now what are we going to do is we're going to take the Landmark and put it somewhere in our in or

94
00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:51.410
among them our dataset.

95
00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:56.170
And there's a whole methodology on how the machine learning algorithm when you implement it.

96
00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:59.280
Our Python or any other language how it does it.

97
00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:03.200
And we're not going to go into detail on that because we just focus on the intuition.

98
00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:08.070
But basically there's a way to find an optimal placement for these landmarks.

99
00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:17.460
And so Lamarque is placed and next what happens is the distance as you see here the circle the circumference

100
00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:18.630
around this

101
00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:27.030
kernel function is actually projected here onto our viz..

102
00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:35.010
So what this circumference allows us to do is it allows us to take all of the points that are within

103
00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:44.040
that circumference and have them like assign them a value of above zero so anything outside the circumference.

104
00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:45.720
All of this blue stuff.

105
00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:48.890
So basically all these red points they'll get a value of zero.

106
00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:49.420
Right.

107
00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:56.160
If you apply this function or a value value very very close to zero if that had any point falls within

108
00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:57.240
the circumference.

109
00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:03.900
Based on this function it'll get a value of above zero and that is how we can separate the two clauses

110
00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:08.190
the green from the red just if we pick the right Sigma.

111
00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:12.440
So here we know that Sigma actually.

112
00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:19.490
Well we don't know that yet but what's is role is that it defines how wide this circumference is.

113
00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:25.200
So if you increase sigma the circumference will increase like this picture in shape but it just it should

114
00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:30.770
change at the circumference here would increase and it would take more space up.

115
00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:37.920
Or if you decrease sigma the circumference will decrease and therefore you'll take the less points and

116
00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:50.880
so basically by finding the right Sigma you can set up the correct kernel function to assign 0 values

117
00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:57.930
to all of the points that you don't want in your classification and values above zero to the point that

118
00:08:57.930 --> 00:08:59.850
you do want in your classification.

119
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.630
And that will allow you to separate the two.

120
00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:10.410
That will allow you to classify each one and that in essence is a kernel trick we have created a decision

121
00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:20.500
boundary we followed actually going into a higher dimensional space without having to project all of

122
00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:26.820
our or create a mapping function that's going to take us two dimensional space and do all that can be

123
00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:27.230
taken.

124
00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:31.630
The point is we're not doing that can be stations in the higher dimensional space we're still doing

125
00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:34.650
the computations in the low dimensional space.

126
00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:40.870
Yes we have this visual representation that involves a higher dimensional space but at the same time

127
00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:45.840
if you look at the attentional part we were just calculating this formula.

128
00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:52.310
And then we're saying if this is great or if this is equal to zero then assign you know Clauss red if

129
00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:57.750
it's greater or equal to is greater than zero then assign Cl. green.

130
00:09:57.910 --> 00:10:02.710
If we if you look at the computer is actually happening and still in the two dimensional space and that's

131
00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:04.220
called the kernel tree.

132
00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:14.620
So all of a sudden you can adjust your decision boundary and and it's on SR and moreover you find yourself

133
00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:19.990
being able to solve much harder much more complex problems like this for example.

134
00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:23.280
So here is a much it's a very simplified formula.

135
00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:28.030
But if you take two kernel function and you just add them up in reality you have to be coefficients

136
00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:31.440
Tetteh here today here and then another terror before.

137
00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:34.770
So they have to be confession's with these.

138
00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:37.200
So if the kernel for months a bit more complex than that.

139
00:10:37.210 --> 00:10:47.530
But in simple terms if you take two kernel functions and you just add them up then because the the value

140
00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:53.530
of this function if let's say this is kernel or this is your landmark want because the value of the

141
00:10:53.530 --> 00:10:56.470
function when you get further away it becomes zero right.

142
00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:57.670
They don't really interfere.

143
00:10:57.670 --> 00:11:05.230
So as you move away from this landmark So this landmark will only encapsulate all of these points around

144
00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:10.770
here and then as you move away this will be zero everywhere everywhere else including in these points.

145
00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:14.670
But then this one will be nonzero close to this landmark.

146
00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:19.760
And so if you just add them up you will get non-zero values for exactly all of those points.

147
00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:25.060
And so therefore you can draw a non-linear decision boundary which even looks like this.

148
00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:31.630
And the formula here would be the point is assigned to the green Clauss when this equation is greater

149
00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:33.840
than zero and the point is assigned to read close.

150
00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:36.070
When this equation is equal to zero.

151
00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:39.080
Now again this is a very simplified example of reality.

152
00:11:39.130 --> 00:11:42.520
This is a bit different it's greater or equal to zero.

153
00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:49.060
This is less than zero and that's because we have the coefficients and it is a bit more of a complex

154
00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:50.610
more complex mathematics behind it.

155
00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:53.500
But we don't really need to go into those steps.

156
00:11:53.500 --> 00:12:02.560
The point is that we understand here that we can create this non-linear very complex decision boundary

157
00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:06.070
without having to go into a higher dimensional space.

158
00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:11.410
Everything is still happening in those same dimensions simply because we're applying the kernel functions

159
00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:14.460
and that is why this method is called the kernel trick.

160
00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:18.130
