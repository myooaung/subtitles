00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,850
Hello my friends all right.

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:05,750
Let us begin this uproar conference bound implementation.

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:11,460
All right so we're gonna start efficiently thanks to our data repricing template because indeed as you

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:15,600
see the first steps are just to import the libraries and import data set.

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,680
So let's do this.

6
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:19,050
Let's go to our data pricing template.

7
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:26,370
Let's get our libraries which we will indeed use you know in this UCB implementation and same for Thompson

8
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:28,050
sampling and here.

9
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:31,500
Let's create a new hotel and let's place that right here.

10
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,810
Indeed we will use map luckily because you know at the end will plot the histogram and we will use of

11
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:39,290
course pandas to input the deficit.

12
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,330
And speaking of important data set.

13
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,320
Well that's our next step here.

14
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:49,710
So let's actually only take that line of code because of course for reinforcement learning we don't

15
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:53,370
have to create a matrix of features or a dependent variable.

16
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:57,330
So let's create a new code cell and let's base that right here.

17
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:06,530
And that of course replace the name of the data set by the real one which is remember add city R optimization.

18
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:12,970
OK so let's do this add underscore s.t. are on this core optimization.

19
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:14,270
OK.

20
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,110
Because we are optimizing the click through rate of the ad.

21
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:18,850
OK.

22
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:25,800
We're trying to maximize the clicks of users to a specific ad and we will identify what is that specific

23
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,290
ad having the highest clicks for rate.

24
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,360
OK.

25
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:29,670
Good.

26
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:30,540
So that's it.

27
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:32,330
Now we're going to run these two sales.

28
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,960
But first we need of course to upload the data set.

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,640
So I clicked on this photo here.

30
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:42,840
Right now the notebook is connecting to a runtime to enable file browsing and also to run the sales

31
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,190
here and in a second.

32
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:44,580
There we go.

33
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:46,350
We should see the upload button.

34
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:52,860
So let's click it and then please find the machine learning is that coding data sets for though wherever

35
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,150
you put it on your machine.

36
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,820
I put it onto my desktop.

37
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:59,970
So let's go inside then let's go to part six we're past halfway now.

38
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:01,860
Congratulations Part 6.

39
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:04,980
Reinforcement learning then uproot confidence bound.

40
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:08,990
And there we go python and we select this dataset.

41
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,580
Make sure also to have this slide open on your machine especially for the next tutorials where we will

42
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:20,210
you know implement each of the implementation steps first you and then us together.

43
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:20,540
Okay.

44
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,870
So let us like this.

45
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:22,670
And there we go.

46
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,960
Let's kick open.

47
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:24,980
Let's press okay.

48
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:26,710
And we will have the data set.

49
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,120
Okay.

50
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:27,870
Good.

51
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:30,550
Let's double click it to make sure we have it correctly.

52
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:30,860
All right.

53
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:36,510
So we have the 10 add and we have you know well you know you will have a lot of page because you have

54
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,450
actually 10000 users.

55
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:45,990
So remember each of the rows here corresponds to different users connecting successively to the web

56
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:52,740
page or wherever we show the ad and then for each user we have a one if the user clicks on the ad or

57
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:53,340
a zero.

58
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:58,930
If the user doesn't click on the ad and I remind that this is a simulation we're not supposed to know

59
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:04,650
all these but the only way we can stimulate the execution at the UCB model and the Thompson sampling

60
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:07,980
model is to have indeed this dataset with the real truth.

61
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:08,340
Okay.

62
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:14,340
And I remind the important thing is that each ad has a different click through rate and the goal of

63
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:20,820
our UCB or Thompson something algorithm will be to identify as fast as possible the ad that has the

64
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,680
highest click through rate.

65
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:23,030
Okay.

66
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:23,550
Good.

67
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:24,780
So let's close this.

68
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:32,520
And now well let's just run the sales starting with this one important libraries and then this one importing

69
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:33,780
the data set.

70
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:38,600
And now my friends we are ready to implement the UCB algorithm.

71
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:41,810
And of course we'll start fresh in the next tutorial.

72
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:46,380
Until then please have a look at the slide you know to get familiar with the steps and make sure you

73
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:47,240
understand them.

74
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:50,060
And whenever you're ready let's implement this together.

75
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:51,680
Until then enjoy machine learning.
