00:05.670 --> 00:05.990
All right.

00:06.030 --> 00:08.450
So now let's talk about research.

00:08.460 --> 00:12.840
What do you need to do before you're ready to launch your Kickstarter.

00:12.840 --> 00:18.900
Now the research phase should really happen ideally three months before you're ready to launch your

00:18.900 --> 00:19.870
campaign.

00:20.130 --> 00:22.320
There's quite a few things that you need to do.

00:22.380 --> 00:26.790
And we're going to walk you through step by step some of those things but you need to be to allow yourself

00:26.790 --> 00:34.850
enough time to do all of these things and in most cases and I've seen a lot of very rushed crowdfunding

00:34.860 --> 00:41.820
campaign and I've seen people who've really taken the time to prepare thoroughly and the results are

00:41.820 --> 00:44.770
completely different and it's quite dramatic.

00:44.790 --> 00:50.670
So give yourself plenty of time before the date that you're going to list your campaign.

00:50.670 --> 00:52.980
And so you can prep and do some of these things.

00:52.980 --> 00:58.320
I'm going to talk about now the first thing I want to draw your attention to is some of the research

00:58.320 --> 01:00.090
tools that you'll be needing.

01:00.090 --> 01:05.850
And we've actually prepared a list of really useful tools that are going to find really handy throughout

01:05.850 --> 01:11.340
your crowdfunding process and that is of course in your freebies package that you should have already

01:11.340 --> 01:12.080
downloaded.

01:12.120 --> 01:16.630
If not head back into the first module and you'll be to the download links.

01:16.920 --> 01:23.430
So these tools are mostly free or at least have a free trial here which always have a generous free

01:23.430 --> 01:26.540
trial here where are you going to be able to do the things I'm going to tell you.

01:26.740 --> 01:33.180
And they include tools that you can use to edit your videos to a host of videos or tools that help you

01:33.180 --> 01:35.520
with landing page creation or e-mail collection.

01:35.520 --> 01:36.500
Whole bunch of other things.

01:36.510 --> 01:39.040
Check it out and see what best suits you.

01:39.080 --> 01:44.400
Now most people underestimate just how big an endeavor Crowdfunding is.

01:44.400 --> 01:50.310
And in most cases you're not going to be working alone you're probably going to have a team member or

01:50.310 --> 01:55.360
at least a virtual assistant who's going to help you out with especially the research phase.

01:55.740 --> 02:00.950
And in order to get organized one of the best tools that we found is Trello.

02:01.050 --> 02:06.420
So Trello is essentially like an online pinboard where you and your collaborators can work together

02:06.420 --> 02:11.340
to see what of the task that needs be done and within each task what are the resources what are the

02:11.340 --> 02:13.740
links what are these to do lists etc..

02:14.010 --> 02:21.120
And usually the way that we tend to organize it is through a to do card and a dumb card.

02:21.240 --> 02:26.700
So you can drag these tasks and projects around until you know you've got everything that's done.

02:26.940 --> 02:33.330
And again also in your assets package that you've downloaded from this course you should have a crowdfunding

02:33.330 --> 02:35.900
planner that we've prepared for you.

02:36.120 --> 02:39.350
It's organized based on a time frame.

02:39.360 --> 02:43.920
So scanning from T-minus 10 weeks all the way to.

02:44.010 --> 02:50.040
During the campaign and after the campaign a whole lot of tasks organize along a timeline.

02:50.130 --> 02:54.080
You can have a look and share with your collaborators and Trello is free to use.

02:54.090 --> 03:01.110
And it's a great collaboration tool and you're going to find it really really useful during your crowdfunding

03:01.410 --> 03:02.670
planning stages.

03:02.670 --> 03:09.120
Especially now another Resul tool that I want to mention is a Web site called Client FM.

03:09.420 --> 03:11.750
And the idea is pretty genius actually.

03:11.790 --> 03:19.470
You have a whole bunch of very clever you know advisors or mentors and we all know how hard it is to

03:19.470 --> 03:21.370
find mentors in this day and age.

03:21.390 --> 03:25.800
I mean I certainly get probably requests for mentorship like every week.

03:26.010 --> 03:34.590
And when you say yes you're essentially promising to do free consulting for the rest of your foreseeable

03:34.590 --> 03:35.210
life.

03:35.250 --> 03:45.150
So it's a very very big ask now clarity addresses that problem by providing contact details for experts.

03:45.150 --> 03:50.430
Now you've got people on here who are venture capitalists and some really big name people who you can

03:50.430 --> 03:57.060
go and get advice from and you can search for maybe crowdfunding or getting press you know or technical

03:57.060 --> 04:02.460
consulting and a lot of these people who've written books who are very well published work very well

04:02.460 --> 04:08.400
known within their field who you can get access to through a phone call and I'm on there as well.

04:08.400 --> 04:12.360
And basically it's kind of like a premium phone line where you can get advice from experts in their

04:12.360 --> 04:17.100
fields and actually get to talk to them in person.

04:17.100 --> 04:24.000
So with crowdfunding very often you want people to review your campaign maybe to see if the description

04:24.000 --> 04:28.720
is the pitch on point or what they think about the video if they have any advice.

04:28.860 --> 04:34.640
And sometimes they really just there's one small hint can make a huge difference to the outcome.

04:34.650 --> 04:37.540
So I recommend you have a look and see if it's right for you.

04:39.360 --> 04:45.090
Now we're coming into a lot of the analytic and data tools that we're going to be showing you how to

04:45.090 --> 04:53.460
use one of my favorite is a Web site called click track and here you can put in the Jarrell of a Kickstarter

04:53.460 --> 04:58.680
project or the project name and it is dedicated Kickstarter.

04:59.280 --> 05:05.700
A lot of times a lot of these tools are dedicated to Kickstarter because it is pretty much the whale

05:05.700 --> 05:08.910
in the game its the biggest platform for Crowdfunding.

05:09.150 --> 05:13.320
So what you can do is you can put in the RL of the Kickstarter project and it shows you a whole bunch

05:13.320 --> 05:16.190
of stats like the funding progress.

05:16.200 --> 05:18.750
How much money was raised every single day.

05:18.750 --> 05:19.590
Where is the goal.

05:19.590 --> 05:25.020
Have they reached it etc. and you've also got things like projection where during your campaign this

05:25.020 --> 05:31.560
can be really really useful because you can see where is your lowest projection What is the lowest likely

05:31.560 --> 05:37.740
outcome of your project and what is the highest likely outcome based on data up till that point.

05:37.800 --> 05:44.560
So you can see with this project that I've just pulled up that currently on day seven of their campaign.

05:44.820 --> 05:51.300
And based on the amount that's raised based on the rate of increase of funding contrac has projected

05:51.300 --> 05:57.980
that the highest amount that they'll raise about 450 K and the lowest amount is about 250 came.

05:57.990 --> 06:03.540
So that can be really useful to guide your strategy especially during the middle periods of your campaign

06:03.540 --> 06:07.950
where things kind of slow down a little bit and you can look at some of the data to see what you need

06:07.950 --> 06:09.300
to concentrate on.

06:09.480 --> 06:15.840
And also it's a great way of spying on your competitors seeing what similar projects have raised and

06:15.840 --> 06:17.180
what their strategies have been.

06:17.190 --> 06:22.980
Now on a similar vein there's a tool or Web site called sidekick and there's links to all these resources

06:23.070 --> 06:24.270
in the course that you're in.

06:24.270 --> 06:27.160
So just have a look for the RL.

06:27.270 --> 06:33.630
If you can't find it with Google and what sidekick does is that it pulls in data from some of the most

06:33.630 --> 06:43.340
recent Kickstarter project and looks at a number of variables and predicts their percentage success.

06:43.350 --> 06:50.220
Now they've also got a whole bunch of stats like this based on historical Kickstarter projects like

06:50.220 --> 06:51.850
success rate per category.

06:51.930 --> 06:58.680
So you can see certain categories like experimental or footwear might not have as high a success rate

06:58.860 --> 07:02.200
as things like boardgames or children's books.

07:02.220 --> 07:06.080
So with all of these tools they can't be the only thing that they use.

07:06.120 --> 07:12.060
They're just one thing that's going to guide you to give you a greater chance of success and some of

07:12.060 --> 07:15.830
these things you know you can't change like what category you're going to be in.

07:15.840 --> 07:17.090
You've already got your project.

07:17.170 --> 07:22.560
It's not really going to change which category you're going to put your project in but it's just a nice

07:22.560 --> 07:28.710
guy to see you know how competitive is it is a certain category and so that you can figure out how much

07:28.710 --> 07:32.220
traffic you really need to bring to make this project a success.

07:32.250 --> 07:36.720
Another really useful chart they have is average campaign duration per category.

07:36.720 --> 07:42.480
Now this is something that's actually quite practical because one of the biggest questions for a crowdfunding

07:42.480 --> 07:46.090
creator is how long should I run my campaign for.

07:46.150 --> 07:46.540
Right.

07:46.560 --> 07:49.530
Because you know you can theoretically run it for as long as you like.

07:49.530 --> 07:54.990
You know you can you can theoretically go for 60 days you know two months or you can go for as short

07:55.020 --> 07:57.820
as maybe you know 10 or 15 days.

07:57.930 --> 08:02.320
And we tend to recommend that the sweet spot is around 30 days.

08:02.820 --> 08:04.980
And the data actually shows that as well.

08:04.980 --> 08:10.350
If you look at this graph and if you look at the live graph on the actual website you can see that it

08:10.350 --> 08:11.660
varies by category.

08:11.820 --> 08:18.990
But generally the best performing i.e. the highest percentage of success is a campaign duration around

08:18.990 --> 08:20.880
between 30 and 35 days.

08:21.030 --> 08:24.320
So you can use all of this data to guide your own decision making.

08:24.330 --> 08:32.160
Now the funnel web site that's worth a mention is a site called crowdfund fusion and it's not particularly

08:32.180 --> 08:32.750
well-made.

08:32.760 --> 08:37.430
They could have really done with a UI and uys designer.

08:37.650 --> 08:44.160
But it does provide some useful pieces data what it does is that it pulls in all of the projects from

08:44.610 --> 08:45.850
all the platforms.

08:45.900 --> 08:52.590
So you've got Kickstarter in the go go a friendly and fundraiser so it pulls in all the data and you

08:52.590 --> 08:56.100
can filter by location and you can search for certain types of projects.

08:56.130 --> 09:03.060
It just gives you a wide spectrum of what projects have been done and which were successful which were

09:03.060 --> 09:03.390
not.

09:03.420 --> 09:09.420
And you can also look at how much money is raised on maybe Kickstarter versus Indiegogo or you know

09:09.810 --> 09:12.540
the big ones versus the small ones.

09:12.630 --> 09:18.390
So to guide your decision making and what platform you're going to choose and there are definitely cases

09:18.420 --> 09:25.300
where people have chosen to go with indigo go rather than Kickstarter for certain types of projects.

09:25.330 --> 09:28.040
Now going to talk about what those types of projects are later on.

09:28.110 --> 09:33.440
But its a good place to get an idea of what types of platforms generate what kinds of results.

09:33.570 --> 09:35.850
And it's very convincing.

09:35.850 --> 09:41.260
Also when you look at the amount that usually raise on Kickstarter versus something much smaller like

09:41.270 --> 09:46.360
fundraiser so have a look at all those tools and have a look at the list of tools that we've compiled

09:46.360 --> 09:51.520
for you and start bookmarking some of those that might be useful for you in your campaign.
