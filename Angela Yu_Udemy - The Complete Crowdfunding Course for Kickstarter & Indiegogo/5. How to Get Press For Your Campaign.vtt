00:00.540 --> 00:04.890
Now the next thing I want to talk about is how you can get press for your campaign.

00:04.890 --> 00:12.540
So one of the most important things I would stress is founders are always preferred over PR firms especially

00:12.540 --> 00:14.350
if you're a startup.

00:14.520 --> 00:19.500
Every single journalist who I'm friends with people who work for Tech Crunch et cetera they all say

00:19.500 --> 00:25.290
that they prefer hearing directly from the horse's mouth from the actual founders rather than some sort

00:25.290 --> 00:29.210
of sales team or some sort of PR firm that they hired.

00:29.220 --> 00:33.720
So I would recommend Don't spend your money on hiring some PR person.

00:33.750 --> 00:36.100
It's not as valuable as you think it is.

00:36.180 --> 00:37.640
You can do it yourself.

00:37.680 --> 00:41.840
And it's often preferred over a PR firm.

00:42.000 --> 00:46.520
Now again the most important thing is just figuring out your audience.

00:46.590 --> 00:48.080
Where do they exist.

00:48.120 --> 00:54.660
What publications do they read and which types of press will be able to get you the most impact on your

00:54.660 --> 00:57.990
campaign and then go and target those.

00:58.000 --> 01:06.150
Because think about it if you have an app or a business that targets teenagers if your product appears

01:06.150 --> 01:10.520
in The Guardian it's not going to help you sell that many more of that product.

01:10.530 --> 01:11.030
Right.

01:11.100 --> 01:15.960
Because there are a few teenagers who read the Guardian but they're not the majority you want to target

01:15.990 --> 01:21.240
the publications and the places where your customers frequent and once you do figure out what other

01:21.240 --> 01:27.410
publications that your target audience reads then you need to figure out a story to approach their journalist

01:27.420 --> 01:27.980
with.

01:28.230 --> 01:30.230
So that story can just be.

01:30.260 --> 01:31.820
I launched the Kickstarter.

01:31.920 --> 01:32.840
I'm so awesome.

01:32.850 --> 01:33.870
Please write about me.

01:33.870 --> 01:35.340
That's not going to work.

01:35.340 --> 01:40.350
Instead you have to come up with something that the journalist will want to write about and that readers

01:40.350 --> 01:41.740
will want to read about.

01:41.760 --> 01:46.680
So it is important to bear in mind that you are not going to be Apple you are not going to be able to

01:46.680 --> 01:52.830
put out a press release and no matter how small or insignificant that news is that you will get a blog

01:52.830 --> 01:57.960
post in Tech Crunch or you'll get a blog post in the next web but unfortunately being startups you have

01:57.960 --> 02:02.500
to capture Jenness attention and you have to capture the reader's attention in a different way.

02:02.760 --> 02:08.430
So for example some friends of mine decided that they want to launch a Christmas jumper and they wanted

02:08.430 --> 02:13.390
to market it as the alternative Christmas jumper featuring humping reindeer's.

02:13.440 --> 02:21.510
And as you can see the product itself is already pretty much ripe for being featured on various publications

02:21.560 --> 02:26.670
you know especially during the Christmas period where there's that seasonality where people want to

02:26.670 --> 02:30.230
write about what is relevant for that particular period of time.

02:30.240 --> 02:37.140
Now they upped the ante further by saying that one of the founders own grandmothers actually designed

02:37.290 --> 02:39.020
the humping reindeer jumper.

02:39.090 --> 02:45.900
And once you combine humping reindeer's during the Christmas period featuring the founders own Granmar

02:45.900 --> 02:52.590
having designed the jumpers then you've got the recipe for a perfect news story and they got picked

02:52.590 --> 02:53.870
up pretty much everywhere.

02:53.880 --> 02:55.950
They were featured on the mail on line.

02:55.950 --> 03:02.430
He even took a picture with his grandma and granddad wearing the frisky reindeer jumpers and it was

03:02.430 --> 03:03.530
a huge hit.

03:03.540 --> 03:09.570
They manage to raise a lot of funding for their other stand up by selling frisky reindeer jumpers.

03:09.570 --> 03:15.960
So think about your own story how you can craft a story around your campaign to make it appealing to

03:15.960 --> 03:19.980
journalists and and from readers to want to read about it.

03:21.100 --> 03:27.430
Now when you pitch your company or your product to a journalist make sure that it is succinct and that

03:27.430 --> 03:31.070
people can understand exactly what it is immediately.

03:31.090 --> 03:36.370
So this is a slide from the Founders Institute that is a really really good guide to how you should

03:36.550 --> 03:42.870
do every single pitch in a startup pitches or your Jenness pitches and it roughly follows this format

03:42.880 --> 03:50.860
so let's do an example say my company Space X is developing reusable rockets to help space agencies

03:51.100 --> 03:53.970
reduce the costs of rocket launches.

03:54.160 --> 04:01.810
And that is a really succinct way of putting across any idea or any business and it can be easily understood.

04:02.110 --> 04:07.750
You don't want to pitch like this for example we are a data integration social analysts company which

04:07.750 --> 04:09.850
helps you connect with your prospective leads.

04:09.850 --> 04:11.260
We use different data sources.

04:11.260 --> 04:12.680
Blah blah blah.

04:12.700 --> 04:18.940
Now I've read this so many times because I've given this talk several times and I still don't understand

04:19.030 --> 04:21.470
exactly what it is that this company does.

04:21.610 --> 04:26.280
And mind you this is a real company's real tagline so don't do this.

04:26.320 --> 04:27.580
Instead go for succinct.

04:27.580 --> 04:28.000
Go for it.

04:28.030 --> 04:33.010
Easily understandable and you will be rewarded with more attention and more press.

04:33.010 --> 04:39.750
Now this is a workflow for actually doing your own press releases and doing your own outreach.

04:39.760 --> 04:45.430
So the first thing you want to do is to go onto Barsoom dot com and sign up for a demo account and you

04:45.430 --> 04:50.220
want to search for a competitor or search for your niche.

04:50.380 --> 04:57.040
So say if you're creating a coffee app then you can go in here and see who has written about coffee

04:57.040 --> 05:02.930
apps or if you know your competitors coffee app name and just put their name in here and hit search.

05:03.100 --> 05:08.470
This way you'll find all the journalists who have written about similar products to yours so they're

05:08.470 --> 05:11.450
more likely to write about your product as well.

05:11.500 --> 05:17.500
Right now once you've found all of those journals and once you've found all of those articles you want

05:17.500 --> 05:22.180
to make a spreadsheet and collect them all together and make some notes about the Jenness about what

05:22.180 --> 05:28.610
does that bead or what they tend to cover what is important or what is their opinion on certain things.

05:28.840 --> 05:31.190
Then you want to go into Varla Norbert dot com.

05:31.210 --> 05:38.290
Put in their first name last name and the domain at which they work full and had work for me and Norbert

05:38.290 --> 05:44.990
will generate their contact details i.e. their email for you so that you can reach them.

05:45.000 --> 05:50.950
Now most journalists work across the world so they probably will be at a different time zone from you

05:51.460 --> 05:56.320
and what you want is you want your email to reach them right in the morning when they have the most

05:56.320 --> 06:01.810
motivation to read emails and to deal with these kinds of press requests and to do that you want your

06:01.810 --> 06:07.200
email to arrive around maybe 7:00 a.m. in the morning in their local time.

06:07.240 --> 06:12.640
So once you've figured out their local time you can use a tool like Boomerang G-mail which is a free

06:12.780 --> 06:19.340
email sharing tool that allows you to send your email at any time point in the future so you can share

06:19.510 --> 06:19.730
it.

06:19.750 --> 06:20.890
And forget about it.

06:20.950 --> 06:27.730
Instead of having to be awake at 5 a.m. And as we mentioned before you can use a tool like get Sidekick

06:27.790 --> 06:33.700
which I think has been renamed to HubSpot sales in order to track those e-mails that go out to see if

06:33.700 --> 06:35.410
they were opened when they were opened.

06:35.410 --> 06:42.360
How many times they were opened if they were forwarded etc. etc. to see if your email actually got read.

06:42.400 --> 06:48.840
So if it didn't maybe you can try using a different subject line in order to catch their attention.

06:48.940 --> 06:56.080
Now when you make any of these press outreaches you want to make sure that you include a link to your

06:56.100 --> 06:59.970
website that contains a press kit that they can download.

07:00.130 --> 07:07.150
So a press kit is basically putting together all of your founder headshots all of your logos your screenshots

07:07.180 --> 07:11.820
if you're an app or a web site your home page or your product demos.

07:11.860 --> 07:19.000
So pictures videos gifs all sorts of assets that are reformatted and resized to every single large medium

07:19.000 --> 07:19.770
small.

07:19.990 --> 07:25.210
And the reason for this is because a lot of tech journalists especially when they need to write articles

07:25.210 --> 07:28.390
they need to output like one new article every hour.

07:28.390 --> 07:33.580
They don't have the time for email ping pong where they email you back and forth for image acid's or

07:33.580 --> 07:35.170
resizing.

07:35.170 --> 07:40.540
So just provide a place where you've got all the possible images they could need in every single size

07:40.900 --> 07:45.040
and that way they can just simply download and put it into their article with ease.

07:45.040 --> 07:51.160
For you that means you'll maximize your chances of getting feature and getting press by making their

07:51.160 --> 07:52.230
lives easier.

07:53.430 --> 07:58.710
Now if you really can't get anybody to write about you then this is a really useful tool to sign up

07:58.710 --> 07:59.170
to.

07:59.370 --> 08:03.570
It's called Help a reporter out and you can find to help a reporter dot com.

08:03.750 --> 08:10.860
So what they do is they send out e-mails three times a day containing journalist requests for sources

08:11.250 --> 08:14.020
and they're categorized into various categories.

08:14.040 --> 08:22.590
Health and Fitness or medical or business etc. and you can often see requests from large publications

08:22.620 --> 08:28.890
or large blogs like Tech Crunch or Huffington Post who are looking for a source to comment on something

08:28.890 --> 08:29.840
in particular.

08:30.180 --> 08:37.770
And what you can do is you can actually create G-mail rules that filters all of these requests so that

08:37.770 --> 08:44.870
you only have to see the ones that are relevant to you in your inbox and the rest of it can be deleted.

08:45.000 --> 08:50.310
So in order to do this all you have to do is just go into your Gmail hit that little gear icon and go

08:50.310 --> 08:52.410
into settings.

08:52.410 --> 08:57.990
Once you're here you want to go into the filters and blocked addresses tab and you want to hit that

08:57.990 --> 09:00.890
create a filter button.

09:00.990 --> 09:09.180
And here you going to filter all the emails from Haro help a reporter dot com and your key word has

09:09.180 --> 09:12.210
to go into the place where it says doesn't have.

09:12.210 --> 09:14.090
Now this is really really important.

09:14.250 --> 09:18.420
So the thing that you're going to put in doesn't have is what you want.

09:18.420 --> 09:21.050
Sounds really counter-intuitive but bear with me.

09:21.210 --> 09:26.520
So for example if you only want to see the requests that are coming through help a reporter or from

09:26.520 --> 09:32.480
Tech Crunch Jonahs then you would put your key word as Tech Crunch or maybe you know if you are a Flowers

09:32.490 --> 09:33.950
company you put flowers there.

09:33.970 --> 09:37.610
Maybe if you're a soap company you put soap that you get my point right.

09:37.920 --> 09:44.070
So then once you've done that you're going to you're going to click create a filter with this search

09:44.790 --> 09:51.880
and that takes you to this page where you're going to say delete all the e-mails from Herro at help

09:51.880 --> 09:56.220
report dot com that don't contain the word Tech Crunch.

09:56.220 --> 10:02.070
So that means that all those e-mails skip your inbox and immediately go into the trash and you only

10:02.070 --> 10:04.860
retain the ones that are relevant to you.

10:05.130 --> 10:11.130
This way instead of having to slog through loads of e-mails three times a day you only get the ones

10:11.130 --> 10:15.510
that are relevant to the subjects or the publications that you're interested in.

10:15.510 --> 10:23.280
Now if you're interested in social media getting press and how this whole field has evolved and how

10:23.280 --> 10:24.800
it works.

10:25.050 --> 10:26.470
Have a read of this book.

10:26.490 --> 10:30.800
It's called Trust me I'm lying by Ron Holliday and it is really really mind blowing.

10:30.840 --> 10:36.060
And it changed a lot of my views on how press works.

10:36.060 --> 10:37.890
And it's a really good book.

10:38.070 --> 10:43.830
I highly recommend if you want to understand how this field works and how to better approach getting

10:43.830 --> 10:46.630
press and getting attention in this current day and age.
