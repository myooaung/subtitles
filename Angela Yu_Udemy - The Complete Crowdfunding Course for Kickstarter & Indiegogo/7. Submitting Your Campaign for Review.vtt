00:00.570 --> 00:06.840
Now the final stage of your campaign creation is submitting it for review by Kickstarter.

00:06.840 --> 00:11.160
So once you've submitted it and once they've had a look at it that it's not offensive that it doesn't

00:11.160 --> 00:15.990
break any of the rules then they're going to send you an email telling you that your campaign is ready

00:15.990 --> 00:21.840
for launch and if you hit the green button when you say continue to land it means that it will go live

00:22.080 --> 00:23.480
at the day that you specified.

00:23.520 --> 00:26.750
So what are the things that you should do before making it go live.

00:26.880 --> 00:32.250
Well you might want to have a couple of people you know have a look at it and put their eyeballs on

00:32.250 --> 00:34.870
your project to see if your wedding is on point.

00:34.890 --> 00:38.190
If your images make sense if your video is convincing enough.

00:38.190 --> 00:41.450
So a really great way of doing that is through prefund.

00:41.520 --> 00:46.560
So once you've created a Kickstarter campaign you can actually submit it to the prefund your team who

00:46.590 --> 00:52.510
will scrape all the data from your campaign that you've created and they'll put it onto their website.

00:52.560 --> 00:57.540
So there's a number of people who browse this Web site seeing what is about to come up in the Kickstarter

00:57.540 --> 00:57.790
world.

00:57.800 --> 01:02.520
And sometimes people give you feedback and it can generate pre-campaign excitement.

01:02.640 --> 01:07.740
So the other thing is that once you've created your Kickstarter campaign before it's going live you

01:07.740 --> 01:12.560
can actually share a mockup version of it to all your friends and family.

01:12.660 --> 01:18.510
So once you've created that Kickstarter project you get a link that you can shed people and it shows

01:18.510 --> 01:24.090
people what your campaign looks like at the moment and it allows people to give feedback really really

01:24.090 --> 01:30.300
easily on the site so you can see who left what feedback and what you might want to change.

01:30.300 --> 01:33.630
So this is something that we used quite successfully.

01:33.660 --> 01:38.670
We actually got all of our family and friends as well as a number of crowdfunding experts to take a

01:38.670 --> 01:45.090
look at our campaign and to give us some tips or hints of some small things that we can update or change

01:45.090 --> 01:47.440
that might make it work a little bit better.

01:47.640 --> 01:52.590
And one of the most useful pieces of feedback that we got was actually that we underpriced ourself and

01:52.680 --> 01:57.510
somebody suggested that maybe we should include a tear that was a slightly higher price point and that

01:57.510 --> 01:59.730
was a really really valuable piece of feedback.

01:59.730 --> 02:04.950
So you don't know what kind of feedback you will get and sometimes you're kind of too close to your

02:04.950 --> 02:07.260
own project to actually see the flaws in it.

02:07.290 --> 02:12.280
So share your product before it goes live and get some feedback and get some reviews from your friends

02:12.280 --> 02:14.120
and family as well as experts.

02:14.130 --> 02:18.150
So this is another great place for experts on clarity FM.

02:18.180 --> 02:23.370
You have a lot of people who've done crowdfunding campaigns before they know the ins and outs of what

02:23.370 --> 02:28.800
a successful campaign page should look like and they can offer you some pretty good advice on maybe

02:28.800 --> 02:31.400
how you can optimize your particular campaign.

02:31.410 --> 02:37.230
Now Kickstarter says that most projects are initially reviewed within 48 to 72 hours hardware and product

02:37.230 --> 02:41.110
design products have additional guidelines and often take closer to a week.

02:41.130 --> 02:48.090
So be aware of how long it might take before your product will get approved and it's really important

02:48.090 --> 02:54.090
because if you're working with a really really tight timeline and your product is held in review by

02:54.090 --> 02:59.190
Kickstarter for that period of time it might mean that you won't hit the deadlines that you were initially

02:59.190 --> 03:00.020
hoping for.

03:00.180 --> 03:07.650
So it's always a good idea to submit to Kickstarter as soon as you're ready to go live and give them

03:07.650 --> 03:08.850
that week.

03:08.870 --> 03:14.550
Or you know sometimes it can even take 14 days for them to finish reviewing your project.

03:14.550 --> 03:18.840
But give yourself that buffer so you can hit the right time points that you want.

03:18.990 --> 03:21.620
And once they've approved it then you're going to get an email.

03:21.630 --> 03:25.200
And when you go into your project you're going to go and see this green checkmark.

03:25.350 --> 03:30.990
So it says that your project is ready to go and everybody gets really scared by hitting that green button

03:31.260 --> 03:32.970
because this says continued to launch.

03:32.970 --> 03:37.320
But usually at this point you're not actually ready to go live yet because you've set a specific date

03:37.590 --> 03:38.340
to go live.

03:38.340 --> 03:44.250
Maybe coinciding with your launch party may be coinciding with you know 8:00 p.m. where everybody is

03:44.270 --> 03:45.030
online.

03:45.180 --> 03:50.180
So when you hit that green button it doesn't mean that your project is going to go live immediately.

03:50.210 --> 03:53.700
Well you'll actually see next after hitting that button it says.

03:53.700 --> 03:55.520
Are you ready to launch.

03:55.740 --> 04:01.500
Please review and confirm and then once you've confirmed it will launch and make your project go live

04:01.800 --> 04:04.770
on the date and time that you've set it to go live.

04:04.770 --> 04:09.260
So that's really really important Don't worry hitting that button doesn't make it go live straight away.

04:09.450 --> 04:11.580
And instead it's your pre-planted.

04:11.670 --> 04:16.980
So we've spoken quite a lot about how to make your campaign the best that it can be and there's quite

04:16.980 --> 04:18.650
a lot of information in this module.

04:18.660 --> 04:23.080
So go ahead and have a look back when you're creating the various parts of your campaign.

04:23.100 --> 04:26.660
So if you have any questions do ask and we'll try our best to answer them.
