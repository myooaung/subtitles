00:00.170 --> 00:05.620
Now this is not a good point to mention to set up your project on track.

00:05.640 --> 00:09.150
So once you put in your project you are all onto the click track search bar.

00:09.300 --> 00:13.350
You'll be happy to see some really interesting graphs that they've created for you.

00:13.470 --> 00:17.290
And one of these is the expected projection the blue parts of the curve.

00:17.340 --> 00:20.230
Is your existing funding progress.

00:20.430 --> 00:27.790
And then the purple part is the expected outcome for your project based on the data so far.

00:27.810 --> 00:32.690
So they give you a highest amount projected and also a lowest amount.

00:32.850 --> 00:37.680
And somewhere between that window is where you're going to hit at the end of your campaign so you can

00:37.680 --> 00:43.800
be really interesting to track during the middle campaign sometimes you have maybe a burst of activity

00:44.100 --> 00:47.300
and that can dramatically change the expected projections.

00:47.310 --> 00:53.820
You can see if some of the things that you're doing to drive traffic to increase conversions is actually

00:53.820 --> 00:56.160
helping by looking at the projection.

00:56.280 --> 01:00.440
Now another graph they create on the same vein is the expected trend.

01:00.450 --> 01:04.150
So this is where they're looking at how many people are pledging and how much are they pledging.

01:04.150 --> 01:11.550
And it almost asymptotically reaches towards a trending amount that your project is going to end up

01:11.550 --> 01:12.370
raising.

01:12.390 --> 01:15.790
And again it's really useful for tracking your campaign while it's running.
