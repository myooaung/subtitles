WEBVTT

00:00.420 --> 00:00.770
All right.

00:00.770 --> 00:02.770
So we've spoken about the campaign video.

00:02.790 --> 00:06.010
Now the next most important thing is your description.

00:06.150 --> 00:11.610
So that's all of that text that you see below the video and it explained to people what your project

00:11.610 --> 00:13.500
is all about in greater detail.

00:13.500 --> 00:18.180
Now we mentioned when we were talking about creating the video to keep it as short as possible.

00:18.210 --> 00:22.080
Now I'm going to give you the complete opposite advice for your description.

00:22.080 --> 00:24.690
Try to make it as long as possible.

00:24.720 --> 00:30.810
Now if you look at most of the successful projects you'll see that they usually about 1000 plus words

00:30.810 --> 00:36.680
long and including all the images it tends to be around 13 pages in a Word document.

00:36.690 --> 00:42.360
So the thing to understand is that whereas the video was to capture people's attention the description

00:42.390 --> 00:48.990
is where people look to to find more information about your project so they might have a specific idea

00:48.990 --> 00:55.860
in mind or they might have a specific hang up about why they don't want to pledge and it's your task

00:55.950 --> 01:00.980
in this part in the description to try and convince them to pledge.

01:01.560 --> 01:04.630
So this is very much a long form copy.

01:04.650 --> 01:09.510
So if you've ever learned anything about copyrighting This is the place where you write that long letter

01:09.510 --> 01:12.900
to convince people to pledge to convince people to buy.

01:12.900 --> 01:19.020
So as I said before the video is the hook so that they'll read your description and then the description

01:19.080 --> 01:26.160
is really the convincer to dispel people's concerns or worries and to convince them that your project

01:26.190 --> 01:27.450
is worth pledging for.

01:27.600 --> 01:32.460
So those are really great study that was done by some social scientists where they looked at the language

01:32.780 --> 01:35.870
that gets people to pledge on Kickstarter.

01:35.880 --> 01:44.160
So they studied 45000 crowdfunding projects and they looked at what was the language that was used in

01:44.160 --> 01:50.050
the descriptions and they differentiated the language that led to the success of the campaign.

01:50.100 --> 01:53.110
And the words that led to failure of the campaign.

01:53.520 --> 01:57.880
So these are some of the phrases that led to the most success.

01:57.900 --> 02:03.630
And if you look at all of them they're all phrased in the way that is thinking from the point of view

02:03.630 --> 02:09.600
of the buyer or of the Pledger was those words that seem like it's more negative or words that lack

02:09.690 --> 02:12.540
empathy and to belong to a project that did less well.

02:12.540 --> 02:17.740
So these are a number of factors that you need to think about when you're writing your long form description.

02:17.850 --> 02:20.010
Firstly is reciprocity.

02:20.010 --> 02:25.890
So think about what are people going to get what are they going to get for your pledge.

02:25.890 --> 02:29.620
Now we all know that there's a lot of support of people and there's a lot of great people out there.

02:29.730 --> 02:34.770
But at the end of the day if I'm giving you a pledge of my hard earned money I want to know what am

02:34.770 --> 02:40.980
I going to get in return whether it be a thank you note or if it's a mention on the web side or if it's

02:40.980 --> 02:47.730
an actual product you want to make this clear in the description and that can be in the form of a graphic

02:47.970 --> 02:51.820
which tends to make it easier for people to understand what exactly they're getting.

02:51.930 --> 02:54.940
Or it can be you know pure text.

02:55.020 --> 02:58.970
The next thing to think about when you're writing your description is scarcity.

02:59.040 --> 03:04.290
Now if you're creating a Kickstarter project there's not really any real scarcity.

03:04.290 --> 03:07.860
So you'll see a lot of campaigns that try to create scarcity.

03:07.860 --> 03:12.720
So for example these 3-D printing guys say that they're confident that they can deliver 2000 printers

03:12.720 --> 03:15.140
per month starting in September.

03:15.210 --> 03:18.920
So they're limiting the rewards to this many printers.

03:19.290 --> 03:24.230
And if they sell out they'll add reward his that will be shipped later.

03:24.360 --> 03:30.510
So basically they're saying take action now and you'll be able to get your reward or get your product

03:30.690 --> 03:33.710
sooner than people who pledged later.

03:33.780 --> 03:38.550
Because we all know that we see something we think oh I'll just do it later I'll do it later and it

03:38.550 --> 03:39.460
never gets done.

03:39.470 --> 03:39.990
Right.

03:40.020 --> 03:45.430
So it's a great way of incentivizing people to take action now and to pledge today.

03:46.950 --> 03:48.760
Another thing is social proof.

03:48.860 --> 03:54.020
So how can you insert social proof into your description of your project.

03:54.020 --> 03:59.900
Well you can put in reviews of maybe your other projects maybe things that you've created in the past

04:00.110 --> 04:04.810
that people have thought were pretty neat and the whole campaign itself is kind of a social proof.

04:04.820 --> 04:10.040
People can see how many people have pledged how fast people are pledging how much they have pledged

04:10.040 --> 04:11.670
how much of your goal you've reached.

04:11.780 --> 04:18.140
So try and insert some maybe some reviews some social proof of how many people have already bought something

04:18.140 --> 04:18.720
from you.

04:18.770 --> 04:20.970
And they have not been screwed over basically.

04:21.140 --> 04:22.880
The next thing is social identity.

04:22.880 --> 04:24.610
What is your social identity now.

04:24.610 --> 04:31.040
This means that your particular campaign text might be different from say somebody else's.

04:31.040 --> 04:36.140
So if you're creating something like the cool is cooler where you're targeting maybe families maybe

04:36.140 --> 04:39.950
the head of household maybe the person who's responsible for the current cooler.

04:39.980 --> 04:46.910
Now that's going to be a completely different message to say a really highly technical product that

04:46.910 --> 04:47.710
you're putting on.

04:47.720 --> 04:53.090
So for somebody who's buying 3D printers it might be that they've had experience with 3D printers they

04:53.090 --> 04:58.070
might have dabbled in it so they might know exactly what it is that they want to have to make your description

04:58.070 --> 05:00.000
more technical for example.

05:00.200 --> 05:06.440
But for something like the Lumia which is just a light right which anybody can own and anybody might

05:06.440 --> 05:12.890
want then you really want to demonstrate where it can be used in which situations and have a sort of

05:12.890 --> 05:16.860
more non-technical approach to how you pitch it in your campaign.

05:16.860 --> 05:23.680
Text and the final thing is gratitude and this is probably one of the most important things in your

05:23.680 --> 05:24.130
campaign.

05:24.130 --> 05:30.580
Text people are taking a huge risk in pledging their hard earned money into your Kickstarter campaign

05:30.760 --> 05:36.020
and you have to show some gratitude for them taking that risk and believing in you.

05:36.190 --> 05:43.990
There's many projects where you have rude creators or creators who feel very deserving of their success

05:44.080 --> 05:47.640
and in fact it's actually a community that's really propping you up.

05:47.740 --> 05:52.780
So try to embrace your gratitude for your backers and you can show this in your campaign text and also

05:52.780 --> 05:57.960
in your updates and try to thank people for their time and the support and their belief in you.

05:58.060 --> 06:02.130
As my mother says being grateful and being nice to people can't hurt anybody.

06:02.330 --> 06:05.920
And end the day they'll always be some people who appreciate it.

06:06.190 --> 06:12.030
And the final thing is authority what makes you qualified to create this project.

06:12.070 --> 06:16.650
What makes you somebody who's not going to run away with everybody's money.

06:16.650 --> 06:17.310
Right.

06:17.320 --> 06:23.890
So in order to show authority in our campaign tax we actually included some of our corporate partners

06:23.980 --> 06:28.570
and the people that we've worked with in the years that we've been running our in-person programming

06:28.570 --> 06:29.170
boot camp.

06:29.170 --> 06:34.870
So they include names that most people have heard of like the ones with the economic signs which is

06:34.880 --> 06:40.330
really big university here in the U.K. We've also worked with the National Health Service in the U.K.

06:40.630 --> 06:44.310
and as well as Twitter and Barclays and a whole bunch of awesome companies.

06:44.350 --> 06:52.210
And we had fun while working with them but we also get to show both social proof as well as authority.

06:52.300 --> 06:58.770
You know that we are qualified to actually bring people this project and we will deliver on our word.

06:58.780 --> 07:01.880
So that's a little bit about the description for your campaign.

07:02.020 --> 07:07.270
Trying to include some of these elements I've spoken about in that text and try to read through it and

07:07.270 --> 07:14.170
imagining that you are a potential backer and trying to answer or at least address some of the concerns

07:14.170 --> 07:17.970
that people might have or some of the holdback that they might have from pledging.
