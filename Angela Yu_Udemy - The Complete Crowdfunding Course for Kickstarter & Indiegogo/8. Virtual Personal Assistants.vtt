Now as you can see there's actually quite a lot of number crunching and data collection that's involved

00:07.590 --> 00:10.370
in doing competitive research.

00:10.440 --> 00:17.040
But it is so important to figure out what people who have come before you have done what has worked

00:17.100 --> 00:20.480
what is not what is the most popular pledged here.

00:20.490 --> 00:26.970
What is the average pledge all of this data that is going to contribute towards you raising more funding

00:26.970 --> 00:27.870
at the end of the day.

00:28.110 --> 00:35.970
But if you are a one man band if you are a lone founder and you don't have any team members to help

00:35.970 --> 00:40.340
you out then this is a case where it might be worth hiring a virtual P.A..

00:40.590 --> 00:46.800
So these are people who are based in India or in Eastern Europe where there's low cost around.

00:46.920 --> 00:54.010
But still people are really well educated and are able to do these tasks to a high standard.

00:54.120 --> 00:56.640
So brick work is one of these companies.

00:56.670 --> 01:02.890
The other one is your man in India and I was actually surprised by how affordable it was I guess.

01:02.940 --> 01:07.980
So I'm not affiliated with either of these services but they were just some of the ones that we looked

01:07.980 --> 01:11.660
into when we when we were looking at Virtual PCs.

01:11.790 --> 01:17.100
We actually ended up hiring somebody who was based in London just because everything got too hectic

01:17.190 --> 01:22.040
and it was better to have your team members all congregated together.

01:22.080 --> 01:24.560
But this was certainly an option that we were looking into.
