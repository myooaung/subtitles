WEBVTT

00:01.420 --> 00:06.040
So now we're ready to tackle how we can get traffic to our campaign page.

00:06.040 --> 00:11.350
How can you bring people and eyeballs onto your campaign page so that they can understand what your

00:11.350 --> 00:13.620
product is about and start pledging.

00:13.630 --> 00:18.880
Now we're going to cover various aspects including e-mail marketing social media marketing how to get

00:18.880 --> 00:24.340
press how to become a staff pick and how to get influences to talk about your campaign.

00:24.490 --> 00:28.400
Now the old adage Where e-mail is king is still true.

00:28.510 --> 00:30.610
The money is in the list.

00:30.610 --> 00:35.980
You know there's a lot of startups that get sold purely based on their lists and their reach.

00:35.980 --> 00:38.830
So if you don't have an email list yet.

00:38.950 --> 00:41.670
My advice is to start building it today.

00:41.740 --> 00:48.310
Now you might say you know we have all these new ways of generating traffic like social media marketing

00:48.550 --> 00:53.640
Facebook Marketing paid adverts or social media posts all sorts of things right.

00:53.650 --> 00:55.610
But here's my Facebook feed.

00:55.630 --> 01:02.770
This is the home page that you see when you go onto Facebook on desktop and just looking at this page

01:02.770 --> 01:07.630
you can see that this is an ad this is an ad and this is also an AD.

01:07.660 --> 01:12.450
So two thirds of the entire screen is taken up by Facebook ads.

01:12.550 --> 01:18.570
People who pay Facebook in order to take up that real estate on their home page.

01:18.580 --> 01:20.330
So when you put out a post.

01:20.350 --> 01:27.100
So this is our poster that we put out recently thanking the Amazon team for a great event that we organize

01:27.100 --> 01:30.250
together teaching Amazon Alexis skills.

01:30.250 --> 01:34.700
And you can see that if it only reached 516 people.

01:34.810 --> 01:42.220
So even if you have followers to your page Facebook will determine how many people will get shown every

01:42.220 --> 01:44.240
single post that you put out there.

01:44.260 --> 01:49.510
So as you acquire likes on your page as you acquire followers on your page it doesn't matter.

01:49.510 --> 01:56.350
Facebook will ask you if you want to pay to boost those posts to show your own content to your own followers.

01:56.350 --> 01:58.420
So this is not where you want to be.

01:58.870 --> 02:02.090
And Facebook news feed algorithm works roughly like this.

02:02.230 --> 02:08.170
What you see in your news feed is determined by a whole host of factors with different weightings.

02:08.170 --> 02:11.260
So for example your interest in the page.

02:11.260 --> 02:16.600
So how often you look at the content that a particular page will post.

02:16.600 --> 02:20.270
So how long do you linger on it when it shows up in your news feed.

02:20.350 --> 02:25.930
Or how often do you click on it to learn more about it will determine how likely it is that youll get

02:25.930 --> 02:29.350
to see posts from that particular page in the future.

02:29.350 --> 02:36.010
Also Facebook will look at how that particular post you put out on your page is performing against all

02:36.010 --> 02:37.410
of your past posts.

02:37.510 --> 02:41.950
So if its something thats doing a lot better than everything else that you've posted before then it

02:41.950 --> 02:44.960
gets a little boost in the News Feed algorithm.

02:44.980 --> 02:50.950
It also looks at your past page performance as well as the type of content whether it's images videos

02:50.980 --> 02:52.450
which gets more of a boost.

02:52.450 --> 02:58.440
Things like links which direct people away from Facebook get less of a boost and also the recency is

02:58.480 --> 03:04.150
how new is that piece of post that you're putting out and all of these factors plus more that we don't

03:04.150 --> 03:10.330
know about gets added and multiplied together to determine how likely it is that your post from your

03:10.330 --> 03:13.470
page will show up on your followers newsfeeds.

03:13.600 --> 03:16.370
But unlike Facebook if you think about email.

03:16.420 --> 03:22.920
Everyone reads their email it appears in chronological order and emails sent virtually for free.

03:22.960 --> 03:23.610
There's none of this.

03:23.610 --> 03:26.860
Boost your email so that people can see your email business rent.

03:27.010 --> 03:29.330
And this is why email is still king.

03:29.350 --> 03:34.230
In a world where there are so many distractions in order to cut through all of the grease.

03:34.380 --> 03:39.850
E-mail is still that one gold nugget so to illustrate how important email list is.

03:39.850 --> 03:42.630
Let me show you one of my friends business models.

03:42.630 --> 03:44.730
So he works as a dropships.

03:44.740 --> 03:45.540
So what does that mean.

03:45.540 --> 03:52.000
That means that he markets a product and when he gets purchases for that product he sends the customers

03:52.000 --> 03:54.470
details to his dropship.

03:54.640 --> 03:59.890
So they usually somebody who is based in China or India or Eastern Europe and they take care of the

03:59.890 --> 04:03.700
distribution the shipping and getting the product to the customer.

04:03.700 --> 04:07.570
So for example he sells fidgets spinners for £6.

04:07.570 --> 04:10.000
99 lets say on Amazon right.

04:10.030 --> 04:12.200
Including delivery.

04:12.280 --> 04:16.990
Now if you go on to a website with Ali Express you can see Chinese distributors who are selling the

04:17.020 --> 04:24.860
exact same product for £2 77 apiece including shipping to the UK or the US.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.380
So let's look at the difference there.

04:27.530 --> 04:28.320
£6.

04:28.340 --> 04:29.210
99.

04:29.290 --> 04:33.670
That's your revenue and £2 77 is the cost.

04:33.670 --> 04:39.470
And if you liaise with the sellers on any Express you can get them to dropship your items for you.

04:39.480 --> 04:44.260
You can tell them that you know I'll send you the details of the customers who you need to ship this

04:44.260 --> 04:49.190
to and I will pay you that £2 77 amount for every single product.

04:49.210 --> 04:52.300
That means that you don't have to worry about the warehousing costs.

04:52.300 --> 04:59.380
The manufacturing costs the delivery the processing costs all of that is taken care of by the Chinese

04:59.380 --> 05:00.140
dropship.

05:00.310 --> 05:05.600
So his the math for this fidget spinnerbait let's say that revenue is £6.

05:05.600 --> 05:10.840
99 per unit the cost my friend is £2 77 a unit.

05:10.970 --> 05:16.580
That means that he's making about four pounds 22 on every single fidgets Bynner that he sells.

05:16.640 --> 05:22.490
He's only responsible for putting up the sales page and gathering the customers details and transferring

05:22.490 --> 05:23.950
that to the dropship.

05:24.260 --> 05:25.860
So here's what he does.

05:25.970 --> 05:34.420
He gets affiliates to direct traffic to his sales page and he pays those affiliates $5 per sale.

05:34.580 --> 05:42.820
So wait a minute you might think so you're paying $5 in affiliate fees to make $5 of profit.

05:42.830 --> 05:44.520
That doesn't seem right.

05:44.540 --> 05:45.580
What's the point of that.

05:45.650 --> 05:53.360
Well the point is an e-mail acquisition so running this over two or three months he gathers a million

05:53.390 --> 05:57.580
emails all from people who have opened their wallets and bought something.

05:57.680 --> 06:05.360
So actual sales emails and out of those emails if he decides to sell another product say a fidget cube

06:05.600 --> 06:11.210
or another gift item he hits up this e-mail list and the average open rate in this kind of category

06:11.210 --> 06:12.560
is around 30 percent.

06:12.560 --> 06:13.050
Right.

06:13.070 --> 06:16.670
So he reaches 300000 people in that list.

06:16.700 --> 06:21.870
Now let's say in those 300000 people he managed to get a 15 percent conversion.

06:21.920 --> 06:26.850
So that's 45000 people who will put down money to buy something else.

06:27.020 --> 06:28.980
Let's say a $5 fidget cube.

06:29.240 --> 06:35.570
So five times what he 5000 He earns a quarter of a million just from that list.

06:35.690 --> 06:41.660
So this is the power of the e-mail list and this is why we tend to say that if you don't have an e-mail

06:41.660 --> 06:47.480
list just start today start building your own list which you can take from project to project and by

06:47.480 --> 06:54.190
having that community by having those people who you can reach you really have the power of distribution.

06:54.200 --> 06:56.360
So how would you go about doing this.

06:56.360 --> 07:02.480
Well here's an app that came out of London a few years ago and before they did any design for the app

07:02.480 --> 07:08.270
before they did any marketing before they even put down any code for this particular app they actually

07:08.270 --> 07:09.710
created a landing page.

07:09.710 --> 07:14.270
So a single landing page like the one that you're seeing right now there's a brief description about

07:14.270 --> 07:18.610
what it does and there's a single screenshot that shows off what it might look like.

07:18.710 --> 07:25.190
And most importantly there is that box where it says become founding member number eight thousand five

07:25.190 --> 07:26.740
hundred and twelve.

07:26.750 --> 07:32.810
So here by putting that line down there's a massive amount of social proof people are looking at this

07:32.810 --> 07:37.530
page and thinking oh gosh 80000 people have already put down their e-mails.

07:37.640 --> 07:38.790
I should probably do it too.

07:38.790 --> 07:41.380
It's obviously something that is quite good.

07:41.480 --> 07:47.090
So what's unbeknownst to most people is that this number was actually hard coded.

07:47.210 --> 07:54.470
So the founder actually went onto his own Web site and updated that number every single day to a larger

07:54.710 --> 07:57.090
random sounding number every day.

07:57.290 --> 07:58.990
But the social proof is there.

07:59.030 --> 08:02.530
I don't know how you feel about the ethics but it did work.

08:02.540 --> 08:07.970
It got him hundreds of thousands of e-mails of people who were interested in his product so that he

08:07.970 --> 08:13.140
could hit them up on day one of launch and start getting downloads right away.

08:13.430 --> 08:16.180
So that particular page worked really well for him.

08:16.370 --> 08:19.540
But how to you know what page will work well for you.

08:19.550 --> 08:25.880
How do you know how to create your own landing page that converts you know unlike these big names like

08:25.880 --> 08:31.560
Procter and Gamble AT&amp;T who spend billions on their advertising per year.

08:31.730 --> 08:36.440
I'm assuming that most people don't have the money to split test all their landing pages.

08:36.560 --> 08:38.180
Figure out what works the best.

08:38.180 --> 08:43.270
So here's a formula that will work better than 99 percent of all the landing pages out there.

08:43.490 --> 08:46.880
The first thing that you need is a really strong headline.

08:47.030 --> 08:52.280
So this is a brief description about what your product or what your service is.

08:52.280 --> 08:56.710
So to write this you really want to keep it simple and you really want to keep it brief.

08:56.720 --> 09:02.780
So I want you to imagine that say a 5 year old comes up to you on the street and asks you What is your

09:02.780 --> 09:04.690
product about what is it even.

09:04.820 --> 09:08.770
And you have to answer them in a really simple and really succinct way.

09:08.780 --> 09:10.680
Well that's a headline.

09:10.700 --> 09:14.570
The next thing that you should have on your page is a subhead line.

09:14.810 --> 09:18.990
And this is where that 5 year old asks you what does that even mean.

09:19.180 --> 09:21.100
What is that product really.

09:21.110 --> 09:26.100
And you explain to them in a little bit more detail about what your product is about.

09:26.630 --> 09:32.960
And then you need to have a major benefit statement as well as some bullet points that all talk about

09:32.960 --> 09:36.550
what are the benefits of getting your product or owning your product.

09:36.560 --> 09:41.280
This is like you know if you talk to the first five year old and their buddy cames that comes along

09:41.290 --> 09:45.680
those are five year is like yeah why do you need that thing that doesn't seem very useful.

09:45.680 --> 09:46.640
Why would I need that.

09:46.850 --> 09:50.860
And you have to try and justify them why your product is useful.

09:50.900 --> 09:57.960
What are the benefits that you will get by having it and this leads up to the first conversion but and

09:57.990 --> 10:04.800
so this is for most of the impulse buyers who are sold very easily on your product who have understood

10:04.860 --> 10:07.910
your benefits and they're like I want to get it now.

10:07.920 --> 10:09.090
I want this thing.

10:09.090 --> 10:12.810
So that is the bottom for immediate conversion.

10:12.810 --> 10:14.970
The next part is the skeptical zone.

10:14.970 --> 10:20.460
So this is where people who are harder to KIMMONS So maybe they're kind of intrigued by what you're

10:20.640 --> 10:22.750
selling or what you're proposing.

10:22.920 --> 10:30.780
But they still need a bit of data a bit of testimonials to actually make them convinced of the benefits.

10:30.780 --> 10:36.710
So this is where ideally you'll have you know some data some stats but you can persuade them with all

10:36.720 --> 10:43.130
that you have some testimonials ideally from well-known people but also could be from your past customers.

10:43.170 --> 10:46.280
And then finally you have the long conversion button.

10:46.410 --> 10:51.270
So this is the button that will convert all the skeptics the people who read right all the way to the

10:51.270 --> 10:51.840
bottom.

10:51.900 --> 10:59.050
So this page layout and this format will convert better than 99 percent of the landing pages out there.

10:59.310 --> 11:04.190
And when you have it in real life it looks something kind of like this.

11:04.230 --> 11:09.220
I mean the formatting isn't fixed right but as long as you've got all those elements incorporated in

11:09.220 --> 11:12.780
there in the right order then you're pretty much good to go.

11:13.320 --> 11:19.860
And you can create this really easily by using tools such as optimize the bounce where they have these

11:19.950 --> 11:25.980
drag and drop website builders where you can drag in images or dragging sections that will have your

11:25.980 --> 11:31.560
e-mail collection and you can use these Web sites to monitor how many e-mails are coming in or how the

11:31.560 --> 11:33.060
stats are performing.

11:33.060 --> 11:38.430
So if you take away anything from this section the most important thing is just to remember that the

11:38.430 --> 11:43.920
time the building an e-mail list was yesterday if you have an idea if you have a product that you want

11:43.920 --> 11:49.290
to make before you go down that path and do anything for it the first thing you need to do is to build

11:49.290 --> 11:50.400
a landing page.

11:50.400 --> 11:56.130
Not only does it start giving you emails start allowing you to collect future customers or potential

11:56.130 --> 11:57.120
customers.

11:57.120 --> 12:00.710
It gives you a good gauge as to how much interest there is in your product.

12:00.720 --> 12:01.420
Right.

12:01.440 --> 12:07.710
If you have this landing page and you see that despite you know having a thousand This is a month you

12:07.710 --> 12:13.380
only have maybe 10 people who put down the e-mail that may be either your landing page is not convincing

12:13.380 --> 12:16.360
enough or people don't actually want your product.

12:16.380 --> 12:22.440
So use this as an experiment to see whether if you know your product is actually valued by customers

12:22.470 --> 12:24.990
people who will actually buy it down the line.

12:24.990 --> 12:29.340
This is the cheapest and the fastest way of validating all of your ideas.
