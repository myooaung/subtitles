00:00.450 --> 00:06.780
Now the next thing I want to talk about is how do you become editors pick or how do you become selected

00:06.810 --> 00:13.000
by the staff at either Kickstarter or Indiegogo to be featured on their homepage.

00:13.020 --> 00:17.230
So what do you get as a benefit of being the Editor's Pick.

00:17.700 --> 00:24.780
Well when you go into Kickstarter and you go into explore the default sorting method is by magic Now

00:24.780 --> 00:33.570
Magic prioritises the staff pick by a huge margin so you'll very often see pretty much all of the topics

00:33.600 --> 00:38.160
listed at the top of this default sorting algorithm.

00:38.160 --> 00:44.670
And when you look at any category sorted by magic the biggest weighting is still that staff pick and

00:44.670 --> 00:51.030
not only that you'll get put out in their weekly newsletter going out to all Kickstarter backers who

00:51.030 --> 00:54.600
will see your project being featured front and center.

00:54.690 --> 01:00.380
Plus you get a post going out on their Twitter handle which has over a million followers.

01:00.450 --> 01:05.490
So the benefits are huge if he can become that staff pick.

01:05.640 --> 01:06.880
So how do you do it.

01:06.900 --> 01:13.890
How do you become an editors pick one of the easiest ways of getting their attention is by internationalizing

01:13.890 --> 01:15.150
your video.

01:15.270 --> 01:21.660
Now when you look into any Kickstarter video if there is a close caption button you can click on it

01:21.750 --> 01:25.890
and view the video with subtitles in various languages.

01:25.890 --> 01:32.940
So you have to realize that Kickstarter and indigo have customers all over the world who watch and pledge

01:33.000 --> 01:34.440
to their campaigns.

01:34.440 --> 01:41.340
So if you make your video easily digestible by people from all around the world then you give your campaign

01:41.460 --> 01:47.490
that much more of a boost and you can do it actually quite easily after you upload your campaign video

01:47.490 --> 01:48.840
into Kickstarter.

01:48.870 --> 01:55.360
You can add all of the captions either by typing it in live or by uploading it.

01:55.620 --> 02:02.880
So the reason why this is such a big boost in terms of becoming a editors pick is because very very

02:02.880 --> 02:04.280
few campaigns do it.

02:04.410 --> 02:09.870
Even when you look at some of the most successful ones people can't be bothered to put in the subtitles

02:09.870 --> 02:15.660
or to put in the close captions and other languages and that makes your campaign stand out to the editors

02:15.690 --> 02:17.150
by that much more.

02:18.530 --> 02:26.180
Now another way of going about this or the Kickstarter suggested way of getting featured is by emailing

02:26.210 --> 02:28.300
two stories at kickstarted dot com.

02:28.340 --> 02:34.340
So actually getting their attention through email and the thing is the important thing to remember is

02:34.340 --> 02:38.100
that you can just hit up this email and say to them hey.

02:38.270 --> 02:40.440
I've launched a Kickstarter.

02:40.640 --> 02:41.550
It's awesome.

02:41.690 --> 02:44.960
Please Feagin that I will never ever work.

02:44.960 --> 02:50.870
Instead what you have to realize is that in order for you to get featured you have to make them look

02:50.870 --> 02:51.440
good.

02:51.440 --> 02:53.850
It's kind of like if you want to get promoted right.

02:53.870 --> 02:55.870
You have to make your boss look good.

02:55.880 --> 02:57.340
This is the same thing.

02:57.380 --> 03:04.220
So what you want to do is once youve gotten some press or some mention either in your local news paper

03:04.250 --> 03:10.190
or in some sort of small blog or maybe if you manage to leverage the blog to get into a bigger blog

03:10.380 --> 03:10.740
right.

03:10.760 --> 03:17.330
You want to post those press mentions two stories at Kickstarter dot com to show them hey look how good

03:17.330 --> 03:18.930
I've made you guys look.

03:18.980 --> 03:25.820
By having my campaign on your platform and that is your biggest chance of getting into the featured

03:25.820 --> 03:32.210
sections now another kind of hacky way of going about this is actually tracking down the staff members

03:32.480 --> 03:36.810
who are responsible for putting on that badge into a certain category.

03:36.980 --> 03:41.860
So I'm going to show you a quick demo of a really hacky way of going about this.

03:41.870 --> 03:48.290
So if you go on to kickstarted dot com slash team then you get into their team page and you can see

03:48.620 --> 03:50.860
all of their staff members listed.

03:51.140 --> 03:55.040
So here you can see that people are sorted by their interests.

03:55.190 --> 04:01.550
So say if you have a technology Kickstarter that you want to get featured right then maybe you want

04:01.550 --> 04:05.740
to have a look at all the staff who classify themselves as hackers.

04:05.970 --> 04:11.390
Now you can see that on this page you see a lot of the staff members right and you see how many projects

04:11.390 --> 04:12.350
they've backed.

04:12.350 --> 04:14.300
What is their favorite category.

04:14.420 --> 04:17.810
And the thing that is lacking is any sort of link.

04:17.810 --> 04:20.380
So none of these click through to anything.

04:20.600 --> 04:25.940
And also they don't give you their surname so you can figure out exactly what all the job titles of

04:25.940 --> 04:33.150
all these people but you can do though is you can hit right click and go to inspect.

04:33.290 --> 04:35.440
And that brings up the chrome developer tools.

04:35.430 --> 04:41.690
So again you need to be inside Chrome for this to work and rest assured there is nothing technical about

04:41.690 --> 04:41.940
this.

04:41.960 --> 04:43.180
Anybody can do this.

04:43.220 --> 04:49.430
It requires no programming whatsoever despite the name developer tools so you can see that it highlights

04:49.520 --> 04:56.000
the line of code that is responsible for serving up this particular image on screen and on the right

04:56.000 --> 04:56.500
side here.

04:56.510 --> 05:02.440
Youve got this tab called styles and youve got this thing called background image and you can see that

05:02.440 --> 05:06.490
it's providing you that you are well of where the image is located.

05:06.590 --> 05:11.010
So if you copy that you are l and you paste it into your browser.

05:11.150 --> 05:16.550
Then it will take you to the location where that image is hosted and what you can do here is you can

05:16.550 --> 05:20.870
right click and you can press search Google for image.

05:20.870 --> 05:25.410
Now what this does is it performs what's called a reverse image search.

05:25.580 --> 05:27.890
So when you go into Google you can search by text.

05:27.920 --> 05:34.870
So say you're looking for pokÃ©mon go right but you can also search by the actual image.

05:35.420 --> 05:38.070
And this will bring up the Google image search.

05:38.090 --> 05:44.210
Now you want to replace this text where it says Twitter here into Linked-In and you're going to hit

05:44.300 --> 05:44.970
enter.

05:45.320 --> 05:52.070
And if you scroll down you'll see the Linked-In profiles that are associated with this particular image

05:52.580 --> 05:57.200
and you'll be able to find the Kickstarter staffs LinkedIn profile.

05:57.200 --> 06:04.010
Now the next thing you want to do is you want to go to Hunter dot IO and download their free Chrome

06:04.010 --> 06:05.280
browser extension.

06:05.480 --> 06:11.000
And once you've done that if you reload that linked in profile page you'll see this hunter button show

06:11.000 --> 06:11.280
up.

06:11.300 --> 06:17.970
And when you click on it Ill show you the e-mail that's associated with that person's profile.

06:18.170 --> 06:24.140
So you can actually find this person's contact details and it also shows you the percentage confidence

06:24.440 --> 06:28.560
the algorithm has in that being the right email.

06:28.580 --> 06:34.580
So once you found the right e-mail then you're going to approach them and ask them very politely hey

06:34.610 --> 06:39.120
you know our particular project has been featured in all of these places.

06:39.200 --> 06:41.020
We would love your feedback on it.

06:41.030 --> 06:46.730
It might take a little bit of digging around to find the right person who is responsible for the particular

06:46.730 --> 06:49.550
category that you're looking to target.

06:49.550 --> 06:56.050
So for example you might want to look for somebody who is responsible for Design and Technology outreach

06:56.060 --> 06:56.580
right.

06:56.600 --> 07:03.860
They would be the right person who would have the authority to to put that stuff pick badge on to your

07:03.860 --> 07:04.770
project.

07:05.090 --> 07:07.010
So now here's another secret tool.

07:07.010 --> 07:13.550
It's called HubSpot sales and it's a free tool that allows you to track any of your e-mails.

07:13.550 --> 07:20.600
It'll show you whether your e-mail was opened when it was opened and how many times it was open so you'll

07:20.600 --> 07:25.590
get a notification every single time that recipient opens that particular e-mail.

07:25.700 --> 07:31.320
And it's a really really useful tool to see if your email actually got open if it actually got read

07:31.670 --> 07:37.140
and if you should be using a different approach to get people's attention.

07:37.160 --> 07:43.700
So those were some of the top secret tools that we found that were really really helpful for doing outreach

07:43.750 --> 07:44.360
e-mails.

07:44.510 --> 07:51.290
And if you look through the three methods that we mentioned one of them will probably help you in reaching

07:51.290 --> 07:57.830
out to the right person at Kickstarter and being able to maximize your chances of being featured.

07:57.830 --> 08:04.610
Now the thing to remember though is that being featured doesn't equal being funded because there's loads

08:04.700 --> 08:10.640
and loads of projects out there that were Kickstarter staff pick they were picked up because they were

08:10.640 --> 08:14.330
quirky or they were interesting or they approached the staff.

08:14.330 --> 08:21.260
But it doesn't mean that you'll actually get funded so you still need a great project a great team a

08:21.260 --> 08:23.910
great community in order to make it happen.

08:23.990 --> 08:28.140
But being featured just gives you that little bit of extra boost.
