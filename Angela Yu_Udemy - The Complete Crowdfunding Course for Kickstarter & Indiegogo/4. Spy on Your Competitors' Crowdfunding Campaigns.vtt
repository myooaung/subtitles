Now a large part of crowdfunding research is all to do with spying on your competitors because it's

00:08.520 --> 00:14.250
very very likely that whatever you're going to launch somebody has really launched something in the

00:14.250 --> 00:22.320
same knish by spying on how their campaign went or where they got their sources of traffic or who were

00:22.320 --> 00:24.160
the backers who actually backed them.

00:24.270 --> 00:27.200
You can actually gather a lot of information.

00:27.630 --> 00:29.920
So I'm going to show you exactly how to do that.

00:30.060 --> 00:36.000
Now in the assets that you downloaded at the beginning of the course one of those things in there should

00:36.000 --> 00:42.810
be a kickstarted research Templi and this is exactly the same spreadsheet that we used for our Kickstarter

00:42.810 --> 00:43.650
research.

00:43.650 --> 00:48.810
I'm going to show you how to fill in all of the fields effortlessly.

00:48.840 --> 00:56.220
So by the end you should have a whole spreadsheet with projects that are similar to yours or in the

00:56.220 --> 01:02.460
same niche and you're going to classify them by the ones that were successful the ones that have failed

01:02.640 --> 01:07.670
and you can see which ones have raised a lot of money and how that came to be.

01:07.810 --> 01:14.490
So let's say as an example so I can take you through the process let's say that we are launching a new

01:14.620 --> 01:16.650
Rayson for some reason or other.

01:16.650 --> 01:20.340
There is a new razor being launched on Kickstarter every other week.

01:20.340 --> 01:24.610
I'm guessing that people are unsatisfied with their current razor options.

01:24.810 --> 01:30.150
So we're launching a new razor and as of course the best razor in the world it's made of diamond blades

01:30.180 --> 01:31.660
and it'll never get dull.

01:31.680 --> 01:33.770
And it's a whole bunch of great things.

01:33.810 --> 01:36.840
So let's do some competitive research.

01:36.990 --> 01:41.490
The first thing they're going to do is you're going to go into kickstarts main web site and you can

01:41.490 --> 01:47.190
sort all of the search results by particular categories.

01:47.400 --> 01:53.670
And this is really useful because you know if you are undecided as to which category your product should

01:53.670 --> 01:58.640
go and you can see what gets listed where and it might be a little bit unintuitive.

01:58.650 --> 02:03.570
But usually people list raises in the category of product design.

02:03.570 --> 02:09.570
And if you have a look in there you can see what you're going to be sharing that category with and how

02:09.570 --> 02:11.580
much traffic maybe it gets.

02:11.640 --> 02:14.940
What are the top funded projects in that category.

02:14.970 --> 02:21.290
A whole bunch of things that can start getting you into the flow of your competitive research.

02:21.330 --> 02:23.680
Now we're going to dig a little bit deeper though.

02:23.730 --> 02:30.930
We're going to go to the Advanced tab and we're going to search specifically for races that have been

02:30.930 --> 02:32.780
launched on Kickstarter.

02:32.790 --> 02:35.580
Now we're going to say we don't really care where it was.

02:35.580 --> 02:39.730
So anywhere on Earth and we're going to sort the projects by most funded.

02:39.900 --> 02:41.480
So you should see something like this.

02:41.520 --> 02:47.280
And you can see out of all the other races that were launched on here what was their specific angle

02:47.640 --> 02:51.100
and which were the products that were most successful.

02:51.180 --> 02:59.070
Now once you found that most successful one and phrases happens to be this project by Rockwell raises

02:59.070 --> 03:05.760
called the Model T and the things that you're going to be interested in is how much did they raise what

03:05.760 --> 03:07.040
was their initial goal.

03:07.040 --> 03:09.430
How many backers they managed to get on board.

03:09.450 --> 03:15.270
What is the average pledge per Bakare which which categories were they listed in.

03:15.270 --> 03:17.280
What were their Pearch tiers.

03:17.280 --> 03:18.840
So what was their lowest here.

03:18.840 --> 03:20.190
What was the highest here.

03:20.280 --> 03:23.180
Where was the tier where most people pledged.

03:23.280 --> 03:24.930
So what was the most popular one.

03:24.940 --> 03:30.150
Essentially you're going to be putting all of this into that Kickstarter research spreadsheet that we

03:30.150 --> 03:31.170
showed you early on.

03:31.170 --> 03:37.500
Now you can either do all of this completely manually going in finding the right numbers for each column

03:37.590 --> 03:42.520
and then pasting it into the spreadsheet or you can try and automate it.

03:43.260 --> 03:48.540
So really useful tool not just for kicks out of research but for any sort of research that you want

03:48.540 --> 03:55.890
to do on the web is a Chrome extension cord scraper and its free to download it's free to add to your

03:55.890 --> 04:02.370
browser and what it allows you to do is to basically scrape the website for the pieces of data that

04:02.370 --> 04:08.010
you were interested in and you can automatically create a Google spreadsheet from it which is really

04:08.010 --> 04:09.180
really useful.

04:09.600 --> 04:15.210
I'm going to show you step by step how you gonna use scraper to get all of that data from Kickstarter

04:15.450 --> 04:17.960
without you having to really lift a finger.
