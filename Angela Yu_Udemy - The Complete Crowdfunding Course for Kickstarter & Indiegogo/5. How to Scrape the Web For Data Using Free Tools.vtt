00:00.920 --> 00:01.230
All right.

00:01.230 --> 00:08.640
So I'm currently on the Kickstarter home page and I'm going to go into explore to navigate to all of

00:08.640 --> 00:17.160
the past raise a project I'm going to go to everything and undo everything I'm going to go and refine

00:17.190 --> 00:22.840
my search and then we're going to go into advanced to search for Razor.

00:23.250 --> 00:29.070
So here you can see you know if you want to look for live project or successful project you want to

00:29.070 --> 00:34.700
keep it all projects amount pledged you can limit it to however much you want to look for.

00:34.720 --> 00:39.860
But we're also going to keep that unselected and percentage raised and goal.

00:39.990 --> 00:45.100
Similarly we're going to make this as inclusive as possible so we're going to keep those the same.

00:45.270 --> 00:53.840
So show me raise the projects in all categories in all locations sorted by how much they were funded.

00:53.850 --> 01:02.810
So now we've got about 149 projects that it's brought up of which the most successful was the Rockwell

01:02.820 --> 01:03.890
t raiser.

01:04.320 --> 01:10.190
And we're going to head into this page and we're going to start scraping some data.

01:10.230 --> 01:14.600
So if you scroll down you can see that all the data is displayed on screen.

01:14.790 --> 01:21.640
And we can just simply copy and paste it over to our spreadsheet.

01:21.730 --> 01:24.890
But that's kind of tedious so I want to show you a different way of doing it.

01:24.960 --> 01:30.510
And this will help you when you want to get data from any web site in the future not just for Kickstarter

01:30.510 --> 01:31.520
project.

01:31.530 --> 01:37.470
So if I highlight this part where he says the total amount pledged and I Right-Click Now if you've already

01:37.530 --> 01:43.800
installed the chrome scraper tool then you should be able to see this scrape similar option come up

01:44.400 --> 01:49.800
and if you click on it it will show you what is the path that I had to look at in order to show you

01:49.800 --> 01:50.470
this data.

01:50.490 --> 01:51.990
Now here's the interesting part.

01:52.050 --> 01:57.740
I want to construct a query with all the columns that contains all of these bits of data.

01:57.900 --> 02:00.860
So I'm just going to select all of this.

02:01.080 --> 02:03.460
Copy it and then put it in here.

02:04.440 --> 02:13.580
And that I'm going to call the total raised and then I'm going to click the little plus arrow to go

02:13.580 --> 02:20.970
to the next column and this column I'm going to look for the goal amount.

02:20.990 --> 02:29.480
So if we right click on this and we select scrapes similar you'll see that it'll show us the amount

02:29.690 --> 02:31.600
pledged at the top here.

02:31.940 --> 02:38.990
So we can select in title we can so we can select all of that and then put it into our previous window

02:38.990 --> 02:42.210
where we had the total raised and we put that in here.

02:42.560 --> 02:46.490
And we call that name the goal amount.

02:46.640 --> 02:47.480
Right.

02:47.540 --> 02:54.260
So now if you hit scrape it should show you total raised as well as the goal amount which is pretty

02:54.260 --> 02:54.830
useful.

02:54.830 --> 03:00.710
Now you can go through this one by one getting all of the things that you want from this web page.

03:00.760 --> 03:08.960
So including one of the number of backers where the project was launched what category was in etc. and

03:09.020 --> 03:16.430
once you've done what you can do is you can save it as a preset and once you give given a name and hit

03:16.430 --> 03:21.560
save let's just call ours Kickstarter and hit save.

03:21.560 --> 03:30.910
So now if I close this window and I go to a different page I see the second page here.

03:32.510 --> 03:34.320
Go raiser then.

03:34.430 --> 03:42.260
If I hit right click scrape similar I can load up my priest which is called Kickstarter and now you

03:42.260 --> 03:45.270
can see it's already pulling in all the data that I want.

03:45.350 --> 03:48.700
So obviously if you have more columns you'll get more data.

03:48.710 --> 03:54.620
So this is a really easy way of scraping the data and you can hit copy to clipboard and you can paste

03:54.620 --> 03:58.220
it in here pretty easily.

03:58.250 --> 04:06.830
Total raised goes over here and now of course you can clean this data by just hitting a command F and

04:06.860 --> 04:12.960
typing in pledged of a space.

04:12.980 --> 04:17.090
And then if you hit these three dots you can replace all with nothing.

04:17.120 --> 04:19.060
So that gets rid of that part.

04:19.100 --> 04:22.540
You can also delete the word goal in the same way.

04:22.790 --> 04:26.300
So I'm just going to clear that out and they have it.

04:26.300 --> 04:32.270
That is a really really easy way of scraping data from web pages using the scraper tool.

04:32.270 --> 04:35.780
Now we're going to head back to the slide show and I can show you some other places where you might

04:35.780 --> 04:36.860
want to get data from.
