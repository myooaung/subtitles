00:00.390 --> 00:04.740
And they're going to be divided into those which are pretty much outside of your control things that

00:04.740 --> 00:06.750
you can't really do very much about.

00:06.750 --> 00:09.300
And those that are very much inside your control.

00:09.300 --> 00:12.640
Now it's obviously more interesting to know about the ones inside your control.

00:12.660 --> 00:15.500
But it's worth a mention here anyways.

00:15.600 --> 00:17.640
What are the other things that contribute.

00:17.790 --> 00:23.640
So when you are newly launched you get a boost in the search algorithm.

00:23.640 --> 00:29.700
It's a way of helping people discover new projects and generating momentum for that project.

00:29.700 --> 00:34.950
Now when you go into Kickstarter and you look at everything sorted by newest you'll see all of the new

00:34.950 --> 00:38.680
projects and some of them already start to show traction.

00:39.210 --> 00:43.320
And those are the ones that are going to be pushed even further up.

00:43.320 --> 00:44.970
The Kickstarter algorithm.

00:44.970 --> 00:52.500
So if you look at most successful project funding graphs on click track you'll see that it follows very

00:52.500 --> 00:57.850
much this kind of shape where the gradient is very steep in the beginning of the project.

00:57.870 --> 00:59.630
And also at the end of the project.

00:59.670 --> 01:05.370
So that means that in the beginning and the end maybe one or two days where people are pledging the

01:05.370 --> 01:12.810
fastest So the rates of pledges coming in is the fastest and that gradient also determines to a great

01:12.810 --> 01:15.170
deal where you're going to rank on Kickstarter itself.

01:15.240 --> 01:21.960
So if you look at these graphs and you look at the initial gradient so the first few days that gradient

01:21.960 --> 01:25.550
is mostly determined by how much traffic you're going to bring to your campaign.

01:25.620 --> 01:30.360
But when you look at the graph and if you look at towards the end the last two days of your project

01:30.810 --> 01:35.520
when that graph is steep that usually means that there's a lot of traffic that's being brought to you

01:35.520 --> 01:37.060
by Kickstarter itself.

01:37.290 --> 01:42.990
So the beginning and the end parts are where you want to pay attention to in a particular project to

01:42.990 --> 01:45.630
see where they got their traffic from.

01:45.660 --> 01:51.930
And as you can see from our project even though we did have quite a steep first few day pledge rate

01:52.310 --> 01:55.500
it was nowhere near as crazy as towards the end.

01:55.710 --> 02:01.980
That graph almost inflect upwards and that reflects how many people were coming in mostly through the

02:01.980 --> 02:06.190
kickstarts platform discovering the fact that our project was about to end.

02:06.390 --> 02:09.620
And they were hitting the pledge button in quick succession.

02:10.290 --> 02:12.060
So this is another thing.

02:12.060 --> 02:18.060
So this is the other factor that you can't really control when your project is newly listed or when

02:18.060 --> 02:25.020
it's about and you're going to get a boost in the popularity algorithm on Kickstarter on Indiegogo and

02:25.020 --> 02:29.970
that's just simply because most people want to discover projects that are about and or the projects

02:29.970 --> 02:31.090
which are new.

02:31.110 --> 02:33.230
So this is again something you can't really control.

02:33.240 --> 02:40.090
You can control when it starts and when it ends try and coincide with periods of most activity on Kickstarter.

02:40.200 --> 02:47.090
But you can actually and many times right and you can't begin many times in one project lifecycle.

02:47.250 --> 02:50.060
So these are just things to be aware of.

02:50.130 --> 02:59.460
Now the other thing that's pretty much outside of your control is the almost a funded moment in your

02:59.460 --> 03:00.660
project lifecycle.

03:00.660 --> 03:07.080
So the point where you almost reach your goal maybe you are just about 10 percent away from your goal

03:07.830 --> 03:15.330
amount and that is the point where you also get a small boost in the search algorithm where you will

03:15.510 --> 03:19.240
where you're more likely to be seen on the popular pages on Kickstarter.

03:19.350 --> 03:21.960
And the reason for this is twofold.

03:22.110 --> 03:29.970
One Kickstarter once that projects to succeed because in most cases on Kickstarter project are all or

03:29.970 --> 03:30.670
nothing based.

03:30.690 --> 03:35.440
So you either raise everything you reach your goal or you don't get any of the money.

03:35.640 --> 03:41.490
So it makes sense for Kickstarter to try and promote those who are really really close to reaching their

03:41.490 --> 03:44.280
goal so that they themselves get paid as well.

03:44.280 --> 03:51.270
You've also got Web sites like kicks Savir where they are promoting and pushing projects that are almost

03:51.270 --> 03:53.280
about to reach their goal.

03:53.340 --> 04:01.650
It's just a way of and encouraging people to pledge and drive that last little bit towards success.

04:01.710 --> 04:07.050
And the last thing that is kind of outside media control although we're going to talk about that later

04:07.050 --> 04:14.010
on thing that you can do to improve your chances of being picked by the editor as a project that Kickstarter

04:14.010 --> 04:20.160
loves to pick depends on human factors so whether they pick you or not is not really something inside

04:20.160 --> 04:20.750
your control.

04:20.880 --> 04:27.120
But when you are picked by any staff member at Kickstarter you get a little badge that says project

04:27.120 --> 04:33.930
we love and you also get a small boost in your rankings in the search algorithm.

04:33.930 --> 04:38.460
So we're going to talk later about how you can maximize your chances of being featured or being picked

04:38.460 --> 04:39.240
by the editor.

04:39.330 --> 04:42.390
But for now we'll put it into the pot where you can control.
