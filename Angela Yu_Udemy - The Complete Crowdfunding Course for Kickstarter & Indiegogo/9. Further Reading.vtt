Now I've spoken a lot about the sorts of research that you need to do before your Kickstarter project

00:06.640 --> 00:12.380
and there is so much more that I could talk about you know and if you're doing a specific project some

00:12.390 --> 00:16.100
things might be uniquely relevant to you that I haven't mentioned.

00:16.150 --> 00:22.570
So we've created a huge reading list for you that includes some of the best articles that we've come

00:22.570 --> 00:27.490
across on crowdfunding and the idiosyncrasies of various platforms.

00:27.520 --> 00:33.400
So have a look in that big download package that we gave you in the beginning of the course and have

00:33.400 --> 00:36.850
a read through some of these articles in your spare time.

00:36.850 --> 00:41.860
Now if you want more things to read or you want things that are more up to date then it's always a good

00:41.860 --> 00:48.310
idea to just go on medium and search for Kickstarter and see what are the latest articles coming out

00:48.340 --> 00:51.370
because you know everything changes at lightning speed.

00:51.370 --> 00:55.870
So by the time that you're watching this maybe there's some sort of new trick or maybe there's something

00:56.500 --> 00:59.140
new in the algorithm that I wouldn't have mentioned.

00:59.200 --> 01:01.300
So have a look before you launch.

01:01.360 --> 01:07.120
So by now you should have thoroughly researched your competitors and you should have a good idea about

01:07.120 --> 01:10.440
how you're going to run your crowdfunding campaign.

01:10.450 --> 01:15.130
Now of course there's a lot of lessons that you can learn along the way that you can't really prepare

01:15.130 --> 01:15.580
for.

01:15.640 --> 01:22.090
But the research phase is all about minimizing those things and you get some of the tasks over and done

01:22.090 --> 01:30.080
with before you enter this really hectic 30 or 40 days I have a mini you choose your campaign.

01:30.460 --> 01:37.360
So one of the things we tend to recommend people to do is actually to pre write all of your emails all

01:37.360 --> 01:41.920
of your updates that are going to go out all of the content marketing a blog post that you're going

01:41.920 --> 01:42.980
to do.

01:43.270 --> 01:44.610
Way ahead of time.

01:44.620 --> 01:52.210
So between you know the minus three months to minus one months ahead of your campaign just so that you're

01:52.210 --> 01:57.170
not rushing around in the middle of your campaign when you have other things to do.

01:57.190 --> 02:01.750
So we're going to talk more about all those things including content marketing including the updates

02:01.780 --> 02:04.590
et cetera later on in the course.

02:04.630 --> 02:11.140
But it's just a good point to mention that if you have everything prepared and ready to go then your

02:11.140 --> 02:17.050
life is going to be so much easier and you can really focus on community building or driving traffic

02:17.860 --> 02:20.740
and all the various things that you need to do during your campaign.

02:20.920 --> 02:22.320
So that's all for this model.

02:22.420 --> 02:27.010
I'll see you on the next module we're going to talk about the ranking algorithm for these crowdfunding

02:27.010 --> 02:27.670
sites.

02:27.790 --> 02:28.280
See the.
