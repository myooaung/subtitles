00:01.180 --> 00:06.850
Now the next thing I want to talk about is the reward is so these other packages that you've put together

00:06.880 --> 00:09.140
for potential backers to back.

00:09.160 --> 00:09.640
Right.

00:09.640 --> 00:11.900
So here's a really interesting graph from Kickstarter.

00:11.920 --> 00:18.220
It looks that out of all of that data out of all of their campaigns one of the most popular TOS in terms

00:18.220 --> 00:24.220
of how many people are pledging for it and what are the tears in terms of how many dollars how much

00:24.220 --> 00:26.870
money they're bringing in to the Kickstarter platform.

00:26.980 --> 00:31.980
So you can see that around the $25 Mark is where the most popular pledges occur.

00:32.110 --> 00:36.530
That means a large number of backers are pledging for that particular item.

00:36.610 --> 00:41.380
But then if you look at around the hundred dollar org that's the tier where most of the money that's

00:41.380 --> 00:43.870
coming to Kickstarter is coming from.

00:43.870 --> 00:45.700
So think about it really carefully.

00:45.760 --> 00:49.620
If you have a team that's $25 you might get a lot of people backing it.

00:49.780 --> 00:54.310
But at the end of the day the amount you're going to receive is going to be less than if you went for

00:54.310 --> 00:56.250
a slightly higher reward price.

00:56.290 --> 01:03.450
Even if you had lower popularity this is the percentage of total reward dollars contributed to Kickstarter

01:03.460 --> 01:07.390
for all the projects that they saw and the $100 mark.

01:07.390 --> 01:10.430
That's where most of the money was coming through for Kickstarter.

01:10.630 --> 01:13.780
Which means it's probably going to be true for your campaign as well.

01:13.780 --> 01:17.120
So think about having prices that hit both of those marks.

01:17.140 --> 01:23.680
So maybe having your main product hit up the $100 mark and having a smaller product or some sort of

01:23.680 --> 01:29.920
light version that hits the $25 a bag Now of course those prices depend entirely on your project if

01:29.920 --> 01:37.180
your project is a digital app then it doesn't really make sense for it to be priced to $100 if your

01:37.240 --> 01:42.770
project is however maybe a watch or razor then maybe $100 is actually too low.

01:42.790 --> 01:44.530
It really depends on your actual project.

01:44.560 --> 01:48.420
But a good piece of advice always is don't price yourself too low.

01:48.490 --> 01:52.960
Now another thing about reward packages is that you don't want to have too many.

01:52.960 --> 01:59.020
So if you went into the shop and on the rail there's only two items of clothing it's very easy to pick

01:59.470 --> 02:00.850
which one I want to buy.

02:00.850 --> 02:01.240
Right.

02:01.240 --> 02:06.400
Maybe I like the stripey shirt done but if you add another shirt to the rag and then you add another

02:06.400 --> 02:06.780
one.

02:06.800 --> 02:08.480
Now you've got four to choose from.

02:08.530 --> 02:13.980
And it's kind of tricky you know do I like the stripey shirt more than the yellow jumper.

02:14.170 --> 02:16.070
But do I like it more than the red hoodie.

02:16.090 --> 02:21.010
And it gets more and more complicated as you add more variables into the mix.

02:21.010 --> 02:28.210
So trying to go for the least number of packages as you can to avoid this kind of decision paralysis

02:28.210 --> 02:32.790
where people don't actually pledge for anything at all because they don't know which tier to go for.

02:32.830 --> 02:39.460
Now as we mentioned previously in the algorithms section you want to have a low tier pledge.

02:39.460 --> 02:45.700
So that's a $1 up to $5 pledge and that's usually something like a thank you email or putting their

02:45.700 --> 02:49.810
name on a on your website to publicly thank them.

02:49.900 --> 02:55.150
Well basically some sort of small touch that shows your appreciation for their support and then the

02:55.150 --> 02:57.850
next year is the $25 pledge.

02:57.880 --> 03:02.750
Now it tends to be that lot of people like to put merchandise in the $25.

03:02.890 --> 03:06.860
So get a branded cup or get a branded T-shirt.

03:06.970 --> 03:11.080
But actually actually merchandise can actually be quite expensive and especially if you're talking about

03:11.080 --> 03:17.500
clothing because you're going to have to order clothes in small medium and large at the least.

03:17.620 --> 03:20.940
And if you're creating women's sizes then it's even more complicated.

03:21.130 --> 03:25.550
So it can actually cost you a lot more than what you're getting in for that tiered pledge.

03:25.570 --> 03:30.710
So if you're creating a tech product you don't want to get into the business of merchandising t shirt

03:30.790 --> 03:31.630
and sizing.

03:31.630 --> 03:33.940
It's just very very complicated.

03:33.940 --> 03:38.920
So my advice is try to keep the $25 something that is cheap and reproduceable something that doesn't

03:38.920 --> 03:44.470
require to be delivered to somebody because Wal-Mart and us is kind of cool and everybody likes swag

03:44.590 --> 03:45.720
creating the products.

03:45.760 --> 03:47.500
Sorting out the different sizes.

03:47.500 --> 03:49.880
Shipping it can be a huge headache.

03:50.020 --> 03:56.140
So maybe something that is dishful maybe something that can be automated will be a benefit for that

03:56.140 --> 03:57.350
$25 here.

03:57.460 --> 04:02.050
Now the next tier you really have to think about is you are $99 or $100 Tim.

04:02.230 --> 04:06.820
And this as we saw earlier on is the tier that's going to bring you the most money.

04:06.940 --> 04:10.090
Even though it's not going to be the largest number of backers.

04:10.120 --> 04:16.540
So usually what people tend to do for this particular price mark is to put their main product so the

04:16.540 --> 04:20.430
main thing that they're selling on Kickstarter at this time.

04:20.440 --> 04:23.300
So for Kanno it was their entire kind of kit.

04:23.320 --> 04:23.820
Right.

04:23.830 --> 04:30.760
And even if your product is much cheaper if it's a digital product like ours try to have something that

04:30.760 --> 04:32.340
addresses this Mark.

04:32.440 --> 04:38.140
So even if your product is sold for $60 you might want to package two of them together and make a duo

04:38.140 --> 04:40.070
pack for $100.

04:40.180 --> 04:43.100
Basically this is a tale that you don't want to miss out on.

04:43.120 --> 04:46.630
Now the next big debate is to earlybird or to not earlybird.

04:46.660 --> 04:51.490
And there's a lot of debate around this topic in the Kickstarter and crowdfunding communities because

04:51.490 --> 04:56.800
essentially what you're trying to do with an early bird reward here is you're trying to create artificial

04:56.800 --> 05:02.220
scarcity that you're saying that you only have this amount of time to pledge here before it disappears

05:02.280 --> 05:07.520
or there's only a limited number of this particular product that you can pledge for.

05:07.620 --> 05:12.400
And looking back at past case studies for certain campaigns it worked really really well.

05:12.450 --> 05:14.480
But for others it didn't do so well.

05:14.520 --> 05:17.380
So there was an interview with the creators of O M G.

05:17.380 --> 05:18.080
Jellyfish.

05:18.090 --> 05:20.470
You can have a acquited is pretty cool actually.

05:20.580 --> 05:27.150
What they did was that their early bird too was $125 where they can get a product at the early bird

05:27.210 --> 05:27.770
price.

05:27.810 --> 05:33.720
And that was quite a lot of incentive because the next bracket up was $175 and that particular tier

05:33.720 --> 05:38.700
was limited in terms of the number of backers so the number of people who can actually pledge for it

05:39.060 --> 05:43.840
and once it filled up 88 backers it was no longer available to buy.

05:43.950 --> 05:48.370
And the problem is that during the campaign they actually had a lot of press.

05:48.390 --> 05:53.210
They were featured on Boing Boing and a lot of tech blogs which got them a lot of traffic to their campaign.

05:53.220 --> 06:00.150
Now the problem was that once the early bird tier was souped up the next tier was $175 which is a huge

06:00.150 --> 06:01.530
jump from one to five.

06:01.530 --> 06:07.390
Think about it if yesterday you could have gotten something for $125 and today you have to pay 175.

06:07.400 --> 06:10.010
It was not a lot of incentives to actually pledge.

06:10.020 --> 06:10.360
Right.

06:10.440 --> 06:16.590
What the crater later did was actually to create a tear in between which helped to some extent her campaign.

06:16.620 --> 06:21.210
And they actually regretted having that earlybird here because they felt that without it they could

06:21.210 --> 06:23.080
have gotten more pledges overall.

06:23.100 --> 06:29.100
So the thing to note is that if you are going to go for an early bird reward here to keep the difference

06:29.100 --> 06:36.510
between the early bird here and the the one that is not earlybird of late bird have that price difference

06:36.510 --> 06:37.200
be small.

06:37.200 --> 06:39.690
So something like $5 or $10 difference.

06:39.810 --> 06:44.970
That means that even if the early bird reward is gone people won't feel too bad that you know they're

06:44.970 --> 06:47.360
paying maybe $5 more $10 more.

06:47.490 --> 06:53.100
So as I mentioned before a really good way of creating Tiss is actually bundling two products together.

06:53.100 --> 06:58.380
So for example if you look at purple pillows campaign they actually have two purple pillows or one for

06:58.380 --> 07:03.200
nine which is I think something like a $10 discount from buying one of them separately.

07:03.270 --> 07:06.100
And you know most people have a partner most people have friends.

07:06.120 --> 07:06.490
Right.

07:06.500 --> 07:11.160
Because a lot of people purchasing things on Kickstarter as gifts because they make pretty innovative

07:11.250 --> 07:14.490
and unique gifts for Christmas or for birthdays.

07:14.490 --> 07:20.160
So think about having a do a package and your reward is and is really really important that you show

07:20.160 --> 07:26.110
people what's contained in those waters instead of forcing them to read through every single reward

07:26.110 --> 07:31.410
his text to figure out what they each are and compare the mentally ill just create some graphics.

07:31.410 --> 07:37.230
Have a look at the image section earlier on we spoke about how to use Kanva to create different reward

07:37.230 --> 07:38.530
to image graphics.

07:38.700 --> 07:43.840
And that way you can see at a glance what you might want and what your reward has include.
