WEBVTT

00:00.740 --> 00:01.110
All right.

00:01.110 --> 00:06.720
So in this module we're going to explore the fundamental parts that make up a successful campaign.

00:06.720 --> 00:13.020
So first thing about the campaign the idea how you can make it unengaging how you can create it easily

00:13.290 --> 00:15.720
and how you can make it sell your product.

00:15.780 --> 00:18.540
And then we're going to touch upon the other aspects of the campaign.

00:18.570 --> 00:21.170
So how to create the images in your campaign.

00:21.330 --> 00:23.190
How do you determine the reward.

00:23.230 --> 00:28.140
Here's how to write the actual copy of your sales page in your campaign.

00:28.140 --> 00:29.610
A whole bunch of things basically.

00:29.630 --> 00:32.440
But first we will talk about the video.

00:32.820 --> 00:37.140
Now the video is one of the most important parts of your campaign and that's why we're going to talk

00:37.140 --> 00:40.360
about it first before you lose your attention span and you not off.

00:40.380 --> 00:42.440
This is something that's really really important.

00:42.480 --> 00:43.270
And hear me out.

00:43.290 --> 00:46.450
So you may or may not have seen our campaign video.

00:46.560 --> 00:55.210
It is probably one of the most embarrassing things I've ever done in my whole life.

00:55.940 --> 01:04.430
It's just so so so so.

01:04.740 --> 01:07.690
Yes so that's all I'm going to show you guys.

01:07.920 --> 01:11.320
If you're really motivated I'm sure you'll be able to find it on the internet somewhere.

01:11.370 --> 01:12.630
But here's the thing though.

01:12.780 --> 01:18.230
Projects with videos succeed at a much higher rate and this is according to Kickstarter itself.

01:18.480 --> 01:24.270
And they've shown that in their data that those that have a video have a 50 percent chance of succeeding

01:24.340 --> 01:26.980
and those without have only about 30 percent.

01:27.000 --> 01:30.390
Now that might be because creating a video is actually quite a lot of work.

01:30.390 --> 01:35.840
So those without a video are probably the campaigns that couldn't really put in the effort.

01:35.850 --> 01:39.810
So let's focus on the things that are important about making the campaign video.

01:40.080 --> 01:42.930
There's a really great quote that's attributed to T.S. Eliot.

01:42.960 --> 01:46.510
I'm not sure if this is true or not but the sentiment is definitely true.

01:46.530 --> 01:51.500
I would have written a shorter letter but I've not have the time it always no matter if it's writing

01:51.510 --> 01:53.210
no matter if it's videos.

01:53.220 --> 01:58.830
It always takes a lot more effort to cut it down than to actually just you know put in a whole lot of

01:58.920 --> 02:00.210
a stream of consciousness.

02:00.210 --> 02:08.310
So currently the average Videoland for a successful Kickstarter project is around three minutes 38 seconds.

02:08.310 --> 02:13.020
So that's not a lot of time and that's because in this day and age where you know we have fast food

02:13.020 --> 02:19.050
fast cars people have very very short attention spans and it's very hard to capture people's attention

02:19.320 --> 02:20.690
for long periods of time.

02:20.700 --> 02:23.910
So aim to cut your video down to around the three minute mark.

02:23.910 --> 02:28.320
That way people will have to see your main selling points without being bored or without wanting to

02:28.320 --> 02:29.250
switch channel.

02:29.250 --> 02:33.660
So one of the first things that you should be doing when you're researching for your video is to watch

02:33.750 --> 02:40.980
a lot of Kickstarter videos and have a notepad while you're doing it and ask yourself what makes this

02:40.980 --> 02:42.420
video engaging.

02:42.420 --> 02:43.760
What makes it memorable.

02:43.770 --> 02:49.350
So if you just search for everything in the Kickstarter catalog and then sort everything by most funded

02:49.650 --> 02:54.900
and start watching video after video answering these questions you're going to start to get a good grasp

02:54.990 --> 02:58.360
of what is a good format for your own video.

02:58.380 --> 03:03.440
Now once you've done that once you know roughly what you're going to put in your video create a storyboard.

03:03.450 --> 03:05.580
So this is the storyboard for Toy Story.

03:05.580 --> 03:09.900
It essentially sets out every single scene that you're going to shoot later on and you're going to describe

03:09.900 --> 03:12.790
the rough gist of what's going to happen in each scene.

03:12.810 --> 03:15.590
So don't worry if you can't draw I can't draw either.

03:15.630 --> 03:17.750
Not many people are blessed with that skill.

03:17.760 --> 03:19.740
It doesn't really matter what it looks like.

03:19.740 --> 03:25.560
It can be stickman it can be you know rough shapes or you can just be text even if you need a good way

03:25.560 --> 03:31.170
of laying out in your mind what each scene is going to look like in a video so that you can plan shooting

03:31.170 --> 03:32.100
it later on.

03:32.100 --> 03:35.860
Now of course I'm talking to you about bootstrap ways of creating your own video.

03:35.940 --> 03:41.910
But even if you have a videographer onboard it will make their lives and therefore your lives much much

03:41.940 --> 03:45.090
easier if you just know exactly what it is that you want.

03:45.090 --> 03:50.460
So in your big download pack there should be a blank storyboard template where you can list out the

03:50.460 --> 03:53.810
scenes and draw out what's roughly can happen in each one of them.

03:53.820 --> 03:59.730
So if you look at a movie and every time that there's a cut that means that's a new scene and the next

03:59.730 --> 04:03.370
time you go and see a blockbuster movie especially an action movie.

04:03.450 --> 04:08.010
Just count the number of seconds before they cut the scene.

04:08.070 --> 04:14.490
And what's really interesting is that if you look at historical data the length of each cut is reducing

04:14.490 --> 04:16.710
dramatically year on year.

04:16.770 --> 04:20.490
And that's a reflection again of how short our attention spans.

04:20.700 --> 04:26.850
So if you want your Kickstarter video to be very punchy to engage people then try to have as many scenes

04:27.150 --> 04:28.560
as you can afford to shoot.

04:28.590 --> 04:34.140
So the more scenes there are the more cuts there are the more movement that that movie has the more

04:34.140 --> 04:37.930
likely it is that people will engage and continue watching your video.

04:38.070 --> 04:42.730
So when you're creating a video there's a number of questions that you really need to answer.

04:42.810 --> 04:47.730
And I'm going to use a really good video produced by the guys of the Dollar Shave Club to illustrate

04:47.730 --> 04:49.060
some of these points.

04:49.080 --> 04:51.350
Why are you creating your product.

04:51.360 --> 04:53.650
Why does it need to exist.

04:53.930 --> 05:00.950
And do you like spending $20 a month on brand name razors Nightengale to Roger Federer and tennis and

05:00.950 --> 05:07.670
do you think your razor needs a vibrating handle a flashlight a backscratcher and ten blades your head

05:07.720 --> 05:13.120
some ass grandfather had one blade and polio.

05:13.120 --> 05:15.240
So I say stop with the why.

05:15.240 --> 05:17.730
Why is it important that your project exists.

05:17.760 --> 05:19.980
Why is it that you're telling people about it.

05:20.130 --> 05:22.020
Why are you creating this campaign.

05:22.020 --> 05:23.140
But the next thing is that.

05:23.250 --> 05:24.110
Who are you.

05:24.120 --> 05:26.870
And also why are you qualified to create this product.

05:26.880 --> 05:30.390
Why should you be the one who's going to address this problem.

05:30.840 --> 05:34.120
Hi I'm Mike founder of Dollar Shave Club dotcom.

05:34.170 --> 05:35.820
What is Dollar Shave Club dotcom.

05:35.940 --> 05:41.490
Well for a dollar a month we sent high quality razors right to your door.

05:41.690 --> 05:43.290
And finally it's the how.

05:43.310 --> 05:45.280
How are you going to address the problem.

05:45.350 --> 05:47.990
How are you going to provide a solution.

05:47.990 --> 05:49.970
How does your solution work.

05:50.840 --> 05:52.400
STOP PAYING FOR SAVE take.

05:52.400 --> 05:55.620
You don't need and start forgetting to buy your blades every month.

05:55.650 --> 06:03.540
All 100 are going to ship him right to.

06:03.630 --> 06:06.480
And finally what exactly will people get.

06:06.480 --> 06:09.180
What are they going to get for pledging in your product.

06:09.240 --> 06:12.680
And this might be addressed in the video or it might be addressed in the description.

06:12.690 --> 06:14.160
It doesn't really matter where you put it.

06:14.190 --> 06:19.770
As long as you show people clearly what their pledge is going to get them because at the end of day

06:19.770 --> 06:20.740
everybody is selfish.

06:20.760 --> 06:24.210
There are a lot of people who are pledging for charitable causes.

06:24.330 --> 06:27.090
But even then people are getting the feel good factor.

06:27.120 --> 06:27.390
Right.

06:27.390 --> 06:29.880
So tell them show them what they're going to get.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.940
And that brings us to a really important point.

06:31.950 --> 06:35.130
As with everything in sales show don't tell.

06:35.130 --> 06:39.990
Now I can tell you that my product is a vacuum head trauma but it won't be as effective as just showing

06:39.990 --> 06:42.590
you a quick demo of how it works.

06:42.600 --> 06:47.640
Now once you've got all your ideas down and you've got your storyboard completed it's time to write

06:47.760 --> 06:48.780
a script.

06:49.050 --> 06:54.630
So taking those scenes one by one and then writing down exactly what's happening or maybe what are the

06:54.630 --> 06:59.070
important things that's happening on screen or maybe what some of the dialogue might be if that's what

06:59.070 --> 07:00.740
you're going to have in your video.

07:00.750 --> 07:04.910
And we've also included a script from the coolest cooler video.

07:05.040 --> 07:11.550
So in your research for Kickstarter videos for any sort of crowdfunding campaign videos this is definitely

07:11.580 --> 07:17.940
a go to Case study because it is just done so well it's done a little bit like an infomercial but it

07:17.940 --> 07:23.650
seems like the infomercial format works really really well not just for QVC but also for Kickstarter.

07:23.820 --> 07:27.870
So we've included the script for the coolest Coola and alongside.

07:27.870 --> 07:33.840
In the next column we've also got Why eight each of the scenes work and try to think if you can incorporate

07:33.840 --> 07:36.630
some of those elements into your own videos.

07:36.750 --> 07:41.670
And the other thing to remember is that Kickstarter backers come from all over the world not just English

07:41.670 --> 07:42.780
speaking countries.

07:42.840 --> 07:46.660
So it's a really good idea to have subtitles in your video.

07:46.800 --> 07:52.110
And if you create is a word for word script it's not going to be wasted because you're going to be putting

07:52.110 --> 07:57.510
that in as subtitles anyways so you can translate it for people from different countries but also so

07:57.510 --> 08:00.160
that people can watch your videos on silent.

08:00.270 --> 08:03.910
Now for a video like ours it's really not much fun to watch it in silence.

08:03.930 --> 08:08.850
But if you haven't seen Facebook videos you'll see that every single one of them has subtitles because

08:08.850 --> 08:14.560
people usually on the tube or they're in the elevator or they're in the office bathroom procrastinating.

08:14.700 --> 08:17.790
It's really really a good idea to have subtitles do your videos.

08:17.790 --> 08:22.380
It gives that much higher reach and people won't just close it when they realize it has sound shocking

08:22.380 --> 08:23.250
for a video.

08:23.340 --> 08:27.810
So the thing is when you're writing a script and you're crunching your storyboard it's very very easy

08:28.050 --> 08:31.920
to get to a point where you want to include loads and loads of things and you're definitely going to

08:31.920 --> 08:34.660
exceed that 3.3 minute mark.

08:34.670 --> 08:39.540
So think about what are you going to include in your video as a sort of reverse pyramid and put the

08:39.540 --> 08:43.410
things that are most important at the top and then the things that are less important and the things

08:43.410 --> 08:49.590
that are least important and make sure that you get your most important points across and the rest of

08:49.590 --> 08:49.730
it.

08:49.740 --> 08:54.780
If it doesn't make the mark if it's going on too long then you can always put it in the description

08:55.080 --> 08:58.200
as text for people to read if they want more detail.

08:58.200 --> 09:00.050
The video is for high impact.

09:00.060 --> 09:01.440
It's to capture people.

09:01.500 --> 09:05.790
It's to get people to go and read what your project is all about.

09:06.120 --> 09:11.750
So try and just have the most important things included in it and not everything that you can imagine.

09:11.820 --> 09:17.610
So if you've ever uploaded a YouTube video you'll know that for every single video Yuichi provides stats

09:17.940 --> 09:23.370
of where people drop off during the video and it's usually quite shocking especially when you thought

09:23.370 --> 09:27.060
about how much effort you've gone to produce each of these videos.

09:27.120 --> 09:32.550
But people's attention spans as I mention is low and you can see that usually after the one minute mark

09:32.580 --> 09:39.340
most people will drop off and there's a sharp decline when most people drop off.

09:39.360 --> 09:45.580
So it's important to put your most important messages at the beginning in the first minute of your video.

09:45.810 --> 09:50.370
And for those people who have slightly more patience like two minutes more patients than they can see

09:50.370 --> 09:51.380
the rest of the video.

09:51.410 --> 09:56.190
But if they watched the first minute and they didn't really get to the meat of your sales pitch then

09:56.190 --> 09:58.060
that's a shame because they would have dropped off.

09:58.080 --> 10:00.300
They wouldn't even know how awesome your project is.

10:00.300 --> 10:03.720
So in terms of video production tips I have a few.

10:04.140 --> 10:09.540
If you're producing a videos yourself you might need footage that you might not have shot so things

10:09.540 --> 10:13.030
like landscape shots things that basically illustrate a mood.

10:13.140 --> 10:19.170
So you can go to upon five where you can find paid footage or you can go to pics or they can find free

10:19.170 --> 10:19.920
footage.

10:19.950 --> 10:21.180
Now it really depends on your budget.

10:21.180 --> 10:24.620
So have a look at both and see if there's things that you need.

10:24.750 --> 10:28.740
But in most cases you're going to need to produce a lot of the content yourself.

10:28.740 --> 10:31.430
So let's talk a little bit about the camera setup.

10:31.470 --> 10:36.480
If you don't have a video onboard if you have a video of who's going to take care of all of us then

10:36.480 --> 10:42.750
you can just skip ahead and go to the next lesson so camera phones are getting increasingly powerful

10:42.750 --> 10:43.630
nowadays.

10:43.710 --> 10:50.820
And in fact there was actually a Kickstarter which was successfully funded where the the creators were

10:50.820 --> 10:54.040
going to make a home movie shot entirely on the iPhone.

10:54.210 --> 11:00.080
So this is a testament to the power of the camera phone even if you don't have a nice camera.

11:00.090 --> 11:02.440
Even if you don't have a DSL it doesn't matter.

11:02.730 --> 11:04.230
Shoot it with your iPhone.

11:04.230 --> 11:09.270
Don't be afraid of creating the video yourself in the process you're going to learn a lot about video

11:09.270 --> 11:14.400
editing or color grading and how much of skills that you wouldn't have had if you didn't decide to go

11:14.400 --> 11:15.290
down this route.

11:15.300 --> 11:19.670
Now the next thing that is equally if not more important is the microphone.

11:19.680 --> 11:24.240
The microphone is so important to any video almost more important than the camera.

11:24.240 --> 11:26.600
So this is a condenser microphone.

11:26.610 --> 11:28.230
I'm talking to you right now.

11:28.230 --> 11:30.290
You can hear the sounds are quite smooth.

11:30.300 --> 11:35.450
It picks up a lot of the sounds I'm making without picking up a lot of the environment.

11:35.820 --> 11:41.980
Now this is picked up by my laptop and I can hear the difference because it's pretty dramatic.

11:42.150 --> 11:43.800
So get a good microphone.

11:43.920 --> 11:45.250
They don't cost a lot.

11:45.280 --> 11:47.670
I'm going to tell you some places.

11:48.120 --> 11:53.460
So there's a great Web site called my previews where you can find reviews of all the microphones and

11:53.460 --> 11:57.730
you can search for something that's maybe around the $50 mark or $40 Mark.

11:57.750 --> 12:03.210
And you can still get a mix of good quality and also in the text page you're going to see my recommendations

12:03.300 --> 12:05.890
for your mike setup and some of the gear that we used.

12:06.060 --> 12:09.520
Next is lighting lighting is super important.

12:09.540 --> 12:14.030
In most cases when you look at color photos on magazines it's all about the lighting.

12:14.030 --> 12:16.920
People don't actually look as beautiful as they are.

12:16.980 --> 12:20.460
But if you have like hitting the right parts of your face you will look a lot better.

12:20.460 --> 12:26.430
So this is a rough guide from Wisteria on how you can light your subjects.

12:26.550 --> 12:32.160
So usually you have a backlight towards the wall and that provides good separation between the subject

12:32.160 --> 12:37.470
and the background and then you have two lights hitting the person at almost a right angle usually a

12:37.470 --> 12:40.560
little bit narrower than that but that gives a good amount of lighting to the face.

12:40.560 --> 12:44.790
So if you want to read this in more detail have attached a link to that in the text as well.

12:44.790 --> 12:50.710
So in terms of video editing software we used free tools exclusively actually to edit our video.

12:50.880 --> 12:57.930
We used movie which is a free software that comes with any Mac or if you're a Windows user you can also

12:57.930 --> 12:59.280
use moviemaker.

12:59.460 --> 13:02.160
And they're both pretty user friendly.

13:02.160 --> 13:08.400
And I would say it doesn't take all that long to get up and running and start editing your videos.

13:08.460 --> 13:11.560
Now the first thing you need to do is what's called a string out.

13:11.580 --> 13:17.370
This is where you put all of the clips that you've amassed onto your editing timeline and then you basically

13:17.430 --> 13:22.800
just watch them watch it in its entirety and then you're going to see which of the clips that you want

13:22.800 --> 13:27.030
to keep and which are the ones you're going to discard and then you're going to start thinking about

13:27.090 --> 13:32.400
editing it down in more detail picking out the shots that you like and stringing them together in the

13:32.400 --> 13:33.550
right order.

13:33.780 --> 13:35.070
Now what about music.

13:35.070 --> 13:39.630
Music can help your video especially when you're doing the product demos or when you're trying to show

13:39.630 --> 13:41.670
people something where there's nobody talking.

13:41.670 --> 13:45.150
Having some music in the background can help the pacing of the video.

13:45.210 --> 13:53.820
So we've linked to Westies music collection which is a bunch of free commercial use video soundtracks

13:54.060 --> 13:59.290
that you can add to your video and describe what kinds of moods that it fits.

13:59.340 --> 14:00.560
So have a look at that.

14:00.570 --> 14:03.500
If you want to add video to your project.

14:03.640 --> 14:08.420
And finally and probably one of the most important things is the thumbnail.

14:08.590 --> 14:15.700
Now you've all heard of click bait where you see articles written something like the top five things

14:15.700 --> 14:18.350
that you wouldn't believe or something like that right.

14:18.380 --> 14:24.130
That basically the BuzzFeed titles but your thumbnail also has to be kind of click bait.

14:24.130 --> 14:29.670
You want people to hit that play button and give your project a chance.

14:29.680 --> 14:35.140
So if you have a look on YouTube and you look at some of the biggest YouTube as thumbnails you'll see

14:35.140 --> 14:41.630
that they all feature human faces and that's because as humans we like looking at other human faces.

14:41.650 --> 14:45.430
It gives us a lot of information and very very quickly.

14:45.460 --> 14:52.020
So you want to include your face or somebody's face at least in your project video thumbnail.

14:52.030 --> 14:54.940
The other thing is what's called the Action face.

14:54.940 --> 15:01.860
So if you have a look at the top page games on the App Store so iOS or Android you'll see that they're

15:01.870 --> 15:04.620
dominated by these types of app icons.

15:04.630 --> 15:09.940
And again it's all about click baiting it's all about making people click on it to check out what the

15:09.940 --> 15:11.090
game is all about.

15:11.350 --> 15:17.710
And the action faces the sort of raw face where somebody is looking into the distance and making an

15:17.710 --> 15:22.540
emotional face where it looks like they are either angry or they're enthused.

15:22.600 --> 15:27.250
I'm not quite sure what that expression is but it seems to captivate people enough to download and so

15:27.250 --> 15:29.780
it would probably help you in your thumbnail too.

15:29.980 --> 15:35.020
Now the other thing that you might want to think about is having the thumbnail convey that there's something

15:35.020 --> 15:41.860
exciting going on or that there's something silly that's about to happen like ours or create an air

15:41.860 --> 15:43.660
of mystery oh what's going to happen next.

15:43.660 --> 15:44.590
What are they doing.

15:44.590 --> 15:46.030
What is the video all about.

15:46.030 --> 15:48.010
Makes people want to find out basically.

15:48.040 --> 15:50.210
Now we've spoken a lot about what to do.

15:50.220 --> 15:52.450
Well let's talk briefly about what not to do.

15:52.570 --> 15:58.040
So this is a really famous case study for Kickstarter campaigns in terms of what not to do.

15:58.090 --> 16:02.640
And there's a number of things here that I would say the creators could have really improved on and

16:02.650 --> 16:04.700
we're going to talk about it one by one.

16:04.720 --> 16:10.040
So firstly as we spoke about thumbnails just now have a look at this thumbnail.

16:10.120 --> 16:15.210
Yes it has the human face check but the human face isn't really showing me very much.

16:15.220 --> 16:17.310
I don't know what that thumbnails trying to tell me.

16:17.320 --> 16:20.320
Doesn't seem to have any relation with the project itself.

16:20.320 --> 16:25.330
The other thing is that the thumbnails not taking up all of the space that it could do almost a square

16:25.630 --> 16:31.810
whereas it could take up the entire rectangle and you don't want to have black strips on the most important

16:32.050 --> 16:34.980
part of your page which is the landing page rank.

16:34.990 --> 16:40.120
So have a look on Kickstarter on some of the most successfully funded ones and compare them against

16:40.120 --> 16:46.030
the ones that failed and see what is the difference in terms of the videos in terms of the thumbnails

16:46.030 --> 16:49.450
in terms of the lighting and all the things that we spoke about in this module.

16:49.450 --> 16:54.180
So the other thing to remember is that even successful directors don't always get this right.

16:54.250 --> 17:02.200
So Spike Lee created the Kickstarter a while back to fund a independent movie and the tone and everything

17:02.200 --> 17:03.370
was just slightly off.

17:03.370 --> 17:08.590
Now you can read this article on Slate yourself but you went back actually took crowdfunding veterans

17:08.590 --> 17:12.460
advice and actually changed the campaign to make it better.

17:12.490 --> 17:16.950
But it's a good case study in terms of you know just because you're famous doesn't mean that you're

17:16.950 --> 17:22.930
a natural when it comes to crowdfunding videos and it's really really important to say here that please

17:22.990 --> 17:28.930
don't put up a vertical video of vertical videos are usually taken on a mobile phone where the default

17:28.930 --> 17:33.500
status is holding it in portrait mode and that creates a vertical video.

17:33.500 --> 17:33.860
Right.

17:33.970 --> 17:39.320
But on Kickstarter and on all crowdfunding Web sites the default format is landscape.

17:39.400 --> 17:44.170
So that means that your video is going to be shrunk to you know almost half the size and people are

17:44.170 --> 17:45.780
not going we have to see what's going on.

17:45.790 --> 17:48.730
And this usually looks like it's a really really poor effort.

17:48.730 --> 17:53.500
So even if you're using an iPhone just tilted to landscape when you're recorded it's really really important.
