00:00.540 --> 00:04.520
Now the next thing that a lot of people are confused about is stretch goals.

00:04.530 --> 00:06.270
So to stretch goals mean.

00:06.270 --> 00:12.150
So once you've hit your target goal you can tell your backers where you can tell future backers that

00:12.240 --> 00:19.170
if we reach the next milestone say your goal was 100000 write that you've reached maybe the next goal

00:19.170 --> 00:25.660
is 1 million then we're going to tag on another thing that's going to be included in the entire package.

00:25.680 --> 00:30.930
So if you look at Kanno which is a really simple program programming computer for kids their initial

00:30.930 --> 00:33.060
goal was $100000.

00:33.090 --> 00:37.200
And they reached that in actually less than a day which is pretty crazy.

00:37.270 --> 00:42.930
And they actually work right below us in our office so we have you know them quite well and they're

00:42.930 --> 00:43.980
really really great guys.

00:44.040 --> 00:48.270
So they were really really successful with the first day of their campaign.

00:48.390 --> 00:53.990
And then they decided to put up an info graphic that showed what the stretch goals were.

00:54.210 --> 01:00.060
So this means that when they reach one million dollars then they're going to add another product to

01:00.120 --> 01:02.250
whatever people have pledged already.

01:02.250 --> 01:07.460
So this gives people incentive to maybe drive more traffic to the Web site.

01:07.460 --> 01:12.270
So if you really really wanted that stretch goal you might spread the word to all your friends and family

01:12.360 --> 01:17.390
so that they pledge as well so that you get that thing that is in the stretch goal.

01:17.490 --> 01:21.990
And in some cases it might even be adding more hardware to the existing product.

01:21.990 --> 01:24.860
So this is the motives stretch goal graphic.

01:24.860 --> 01:32.580
So motive is a wearable e.g. headset which is a piece of hardware that can read your brainwaves to interpret

01:32.700 --> 01:38.680
and you can basically control things using the power of your mind to really cool piece of tech.

01:38.730 --> 01:44.530
And they basically said that once that campaign reaches one million then they're going to add more sensors.

01:44.550 --> 01:49.800
And once it reaches one and a quarter million they're going to add a SD card reader and basically loads

01:49.800 --> 01:54.650
more hardware every single time they reach of subsequent stretch goals.

01:54.660 --> 01:57.640
Now it's really cool that they reached all their goals.

01:57.690 --> 02:02.640
But you have to think really really hard about the math when you decide to go down the stretch go over

02:02.640 --> 02:09.720
it because if your funding goal was $10000 and you raised a million dollars it doesn't mean that you

02:09.720 --> 02:12.150
keep 1 million minus 10000 right.

02:12.150 --> 02:17.620
It's not like you get an extra nine hundred ninety thousand dollars just as a bonus.

02:17.640 --> 02:23.900
That's not how it works because more funding equals more backas the unit costs are still the same.

02:23.940 --> 02:30.840
So when you raised $10000 say that per product you are asking people to pledge $10 when you raise a

02:30.840 --> 02:31.940
million dollars.

02:31.950 --> 02:35.800
People are still pledging $10 for each product.

02:35.850 --> 02:38.840
That's not changing your profit margins aren't changing.

02:39.000 --> 02:44.580
So it means that maybe initially when you only had 10000 backers You might have been able to store your

02:44.580 --> 02:46.910
products in your garridge for free.

02:46.950 --> 02:53.880
But now if you have 100000 backers are each paying $10 you'll meet a warehouse and maybe you didn't

02:53.880 --> 03:00.220
actually account for warehousing costs when you initially came up with that unit cost of $10 per unit.

03:00.240 --> 03:00.900
Right.

03:00.900 --> 03:05.420
So think about your stretch goals carefully before you decide to go down that route.

03:05.430 --> 03:13.740
So a $10 pledge times 100000 backers equals 1 million raised but it's still $10 per unit that you're

03:13.740 --> 03:14.660
asking for.

03:14.880 --> 03:21.970
Now out of that $10 maybe $4 is the cost of creating the initial product that you promised in your Kickstarter.

03:21.990 --> 03:22.330
Right.

03:22.380 --> 03:28.400
But maybe you've added a stretch goal which promised more features or more hardware and that maybe puts

03:28.410 --> 03:32.750
the cost up from fondles the $6 which actually decreases your profit.

03:32.760 --> 03:38.430
So I think really really hard and do the math before you decide to go down the stretch goal route.
