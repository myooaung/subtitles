00:00.710 --> 00:02.590
So what is in your control.

00:02.780 --> 00:07.070
Well one of the biggest things that you need to look at is the number of backers that you're getting

00:07.070 --> 00:07.660
per day.

00:07.670 --> 00:10.510
So the rate of back increase essentially.

00:10.700 --> 00:15.790
And this is actually how many people are pledging your project per day or per hour.

00:15.860 --> 00:17.000
If you're already popular.

00:17.330 --> 00:21.890
So if you look at Qik track for any given project that was successful.

00:21.890 --> 00:28.620
So we've taken the coolest cool project and you look at the number of backers that they got per day.

00:28.850 --> 00:37.270
It was highest towards day three day four which is when the media started picking them up and also towards

00:37.280 --> 00:38.860
the end when the project was about.

00:38.870 --> 00:43.060
And this is when they were being listed on Kickstarter as popular pages.

00:43.070 --> 00:48.860
So the important thing to focus on is not your total number of backers but how many backers you're getting

00:48.860 --> 00:50.180
per day.

00:50.180 --> 00:54.870
Think about it this way if you get 50 backers on day one that's 50 backers per day.

00:55.070 --> 00:59.440
But if you get 50 backers on day 10 that's only five back as day.

00:59.630 --> 01:06.380
So that number the number of backers per day will contribute towards where you rank within that popular

01:06.380 --> 01:11.660
page whether if you display right at the top you know within the top 10 where you're most likely to

01:11.660 --> 01:17.750
be discovered or if you're below the fold i.e. people have to click on a button to see the next page

01:17.790 --> 01:24.390
and the next page we all know that nobody really cares about Google's page to a page three search listings.

01:24.440 --> 01:29.690
And equally you know the high rank on the popular page the more likely it is that people will click

01:29.690 --> 01:31.650
on it and discover your project.

01:31.670 --> 01:34.880
So focus on your number back as per day.

01:34.880 --> 01:42.590
Now from our data in order to get onto the categories popular page so the popular page for technology

01:42.620 --> 01:50.750
or popular for design you need to have about 43 backers coming in per day and to get onto the overall

01:50.750 --> 01:58.440
popular page you need about 76 backas per day so that's quite a lot of numbers.

01:58.460 --> 02:00.450
And how can you fill those up.

02:00.470 --> 02:01.990
Well think about your pledges.

02:02.000 --> 02:08.120
You need a low tier pledge and in most projects you'll see that people have a really low tier a pledge

02:08.120 --> 02:13.250
like around $1 or $5 and that's just meant to act as an encouragement where people don't really get

02:13.250 --> 02:16.430
anything tangible is just to support your project.

02:16.430 --> 02:23.150
So for example you can say he pledged $5 you'll be able to access all the updates for the project which

02:23.150 --> 02:31.070
can be back only other times people say you know we'll give you a sticker or we'll give you some digital

02:31.070 --> 02:32.210
asset.

02:32.330 --> 02:33.680
Thank you card.

02:33.980 --> 02:38.450
I would advise that if you're going for the low tier pledged to try and increase your number of backers

02:38.640 --> 02:45.590
to try and make this something that is digital and replicable because you don't really want to have

02:45.590 --> 02:49.930
to spend a huge amount of time delivering to this team.

02:49.940 --> 02:57.490
So usually what works quite well is you know to list all the people who've pledged $10 on your Web site

02:57.890 --> 03:01.090
as a way of saying thank you.

03:01.310 --> 03:07.910
Or sending people a individual email thanking them for pledging or sending them some sort of digital

03:07.910 --> 03:14.990
asset like a digital poster or digital infor graphic whatever it is that's relevant to your product

03:15.980 --> 03:18.170
to boost up that low tier pledge.

03:18.200 --> 03:23.180
In most cases your low tier pledges are going to be your family and friends and people who really believe

03:23.210 --> 03:26.000
in the cause behind your project.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.250
If there is one.

03:27.560 --> 03:34.820
So my advice is always have a low tip pledge and make it something that can be automated or replicable.

03:34.910 --> 03:38.750
That way you will get a lot of people backing because it's very low effort.

03:38.750 --> 03:41.120
You know $5 or two dollars.

03:41.120 --> 03:47.990
It's not a big deal and you boost up that number of backers per day metric that helps you rank in the

03:48.020 --> 03:50.400
kickstart algorithm.

03:50.420 --> 03:56.390
So this is the part where you call upon all your friends and all your friendship and just say hey please

03:56.390 --> 04:01.340
just you know pledge $3 or $5 depending on the type of friends you have.

04:01.400 --> 04:03.570
This might be really easy or might be really hard.

04:03.620 --> 04:08.450
And one of the things that people do that works really well is having a launch party.

04:08.450 --> 04:14.240
So on the day where your Kickstarter is about to go live making it live and then having people at the

04:14.240 --> 04:21.500
party contribute maybe like $2 or $3 for your low tier and you providing the booze for the party.

04:21.650 --> 04:27.170
That usually tends to help you boost up your initial numbers very very quickly and gives you a large

04:27.170 --> 04:29.780
number of backers from day one.

04:29.780 --> 04:35.540
The next thing that is really important in you ranking on the Kickstarter algorithm is the percentage

04:35.540 --> 04:39.130
funded and it's all about that progress bar at the end of the day.

04:39.200 --> 04:40.700
Firstly the social proof.

04:40.700 --> 04:48.020
So when people see that a project is almost funded or has gone quite a lot the way they're more likely

04:48.020 --> 04:53.870
to pledge and help you out and push you you know we all have that kind of completion OCD.

04:54.200 --> 05:00.450
So like when I created to do list I want to tick them off and it's the drive to take them off I mean

05:00.450 --> 05:02.380
do a lot of the task is really weird.

05:02.400 --> 05:08.170
I know but I think a lot of people have this wanting something to be completed.

05:08.410 --> 05:15.180
Dr. psychological can't really explain it but this is one of those things when your project is almost

05:15.210 --> 05:16.030
completed.

05:16.050 --> 05:19.440
People have a need to try and push it towards the end.

05:19.500 --> 05:26.040
And in most of the projects that we looked at in our data you need to be about 65 percent funded on

05:26.040 --> 05:29.290
day one in order to get onto the popular page.

05:29.670 --> 05:37.650
And on average it took most of those projects that were listed on the popular page about 5.9 days to

05:37.650 --> 05:38.940
get to 100 percent funded.

05:38.940 --> 05:44.850
So that's a really short time period when you consider that the average length of campaigns are about

05:44.880 --> 05:46.870
35 to 40 days.

05:46.890 --> 05:54.140
So you really want to become fully funded 100 percent funded basically from day one.

05:54.150 --> 05:58.950
So there's two ways of going about this you can either go for a high pledge i.e. if you know that you're

05:58.950 --> 06:05.400
going to get lots of pledges from your followers or from your backers or your subscribers.

06:05.400 --> 06:11.310
Then you know that you're going to get a lot of pledges and you're going to succeed on your 100 percent

06:11.310 --> 06:12.890
goal pretty quickly.

06:13.380 --> 06:17.060
Or the alternative is just to set a low goal.

06:17.130 --> 06:23.910
So we know that that number that percentage funded number be it you know 40 percent funded or 100 percent

06:23.910 --> 06:24.500
funded.

06:24.660 --> 06:31.050
Or in our case something like 3000 percent funded that number helps you rank in the kickstart algorithm

06:31.170 --> 06:37.350
and being able to rank on them means that you'll get discovered by more people which means more pledges

06:37.450 --> 06:39.380
as a positive enforcement loop.

06:39.570 --> 06:44.820
So either go for a low goal when you're not really sure how many backers you're going to be able to

06:44.820 --> 06:50.370
bring to the platform or if you know that you have a lot of people who are going to be pledging then

06:50.370 --> 06:52.760
you can go for a slightly higher goal.

06:52.800 --> 06:56.160
So for us we actually set the goal at something quite ridiculous.

06:56.160 --> 07:00.960
We said that some 150 pounds which was something that we knew we were definitely going to be have to

07:00.960 --> 07:02.940
get within the first 24 hours.

07:02.940 --> 07:10.420
So our aim was to get to 100 percent funded within the first 24 hours so that we get that boost alongside

07:10.470 --> 07:16.230
with the newly listed campaign boost and that will help us rank on Kickstarter.

07:16.470 --> 07:23.610
So that took us about two hours actually in the end to complete and that initial traction really helped

07:23.700 --> 07:28.640
start pulling in Kickstarter backers from day one which was really important.

07:29.220 --> 07:34.010
So the thing to remember about Kickstarter though is that it is usually all or nothing.

07:34.050 --> 07:38.200
So you either get to a goal or you don't get any of the money.

07:38.370 --> 07:44.310
And that means that you have to work out how much is going to cost you to produce the thing are you

07:44.310 --> 07:47.070
going to produce for us it was a digital item.

07:47.070 --> 07:50.850
So we knew that we were going to go and build this online platform.

07:50.880 --> 07:55.650
We knew that we were going to produce the things that we said we were going to make anyways so it didn't

07:55.650 --> 08:00.180
really matter so much where we set the goal and it was purely for optimization purposes.

08:00.300 --> 08:06.750
But if you are making a product from scratch especially a physical product where you've got prototyping

08:06.750 --> 08:12.880
costs you've got manufacturing costs you've got maybe warehousing costs a whole bunch of things.

08:12.900 --> 08:19.800
Make sure that you get your numbers right because otherwise it might be that you actually end up at

08:19.800 --> 08:25.120
a net loss from your successful Kickstarter which is not really all that fun either.

08:25.320 --> 08:31.140
So remember that if you have a physical product think long and hard about how much it's going to cost

08:31.140 --> 08:34.150
you to make these things per unit.

08:34.310 --> 08:40.500
Maybe for you know 100 units or a thousand units and then work out backwards how much your goal needs

08:40.500 --> 08:45.870
to be so that you don't end up losing out and you have a comfortable security cushion so that even if

08:45.960 --> 08:52.220
unpredictable things happen that you don't end up being worse off by a successful Kickstarter campaign.

08:52.350 --> 08:57.240
And we're going to talk a little bit more about how even you know projects that were raised millions

08:57.330 --> 09:04.900
ended up actually and a net loss because they didn't do their numbers before the campaign so launch

09:04.900 --> 09:09.220
day success is mostly down to the traffic that you're going to bring.

09:09.220 --> 09:11.210
So you're going to be hitting your email list.

09:11.230 --> 09:17.260
You're going to be hitting up influences who you've lined up and you're going to be hitting up existing

09:17.260 --> 09:23.470
backers that you know we're going to go into this in a lot more detail in the traffic module of this

09:23.500 --> 09:24.250
course.

09:24.250 --> 09:31.900
But essentially all that initial first few days that curve that steep curve is mostly going to be your

09:31.900 --> 09:38.230
own effort and you need to make sure that within the first 24 at least you know within 48 hours that

09:38.230 --> 09:40.510
you can hit that 100 percent goal.

09:40.540 --> 09:43.500
So you're going to have to be driving a lot of traffic.

09:43.570 --> 09:47.710
And we're going to show you how to do that in the next module in fact.

09:48.400 --> 09:53.230
So the last thing we're going to talk about that we found has a significant impact at least with our

09:53.230 --> 09:59.470
data on the Kickstarter ranking algorithm is the amount that you raised per day.

09:59.620 --> 10:05.320
So we spoke about the number of backers per day which is almost easier to game because you can have

10:05.320 --> 10:09.720
the low tier pledges but at the end of the day to kickstart it's all about the cold hard cash.

10:09.750 --> 10:15.280
How much of it that you're bringing in to Kickstarter per day remember that Kickstarter is taking a

10:15.280 --> 10:17.670
10 percent cut of whatever it is that you make.

10:17.760 --> 10:21.940
So it makes sense for them to push the projects that are bringing in the most money.

10:21.940 --> 10:28.420
So based on our data the project that appeared on the popular page of Kickstarter on average raised

10:28.420 --> 10:32.060
about twelve thousand six hundred dollars on day one.

10:32.080 --> 10:39.030
So thats how much money that most projects which rank on the popular page brought in on the first day.

10:39.100 --> 10:44.260
So there is a little bit of pressure but thats what the data show thats how much money that most of

10:44.260 --> 10:50.030
the projects that showed up on the popular page of Kickstarter managed to raise on day one.

10:50.050 --> 10:57.220
So if you have a look again at Qik track you can see that the coolest Coola didn't actually do you know

10:57.280 --> 11:03.040
amazingly compared to Obviously the rest of that data on day one was pretty much the lowest amount that

11:03.040 --> 11:03.930
they raised.

11:04.000 --> 11:11.200
And this was before they got picked up by press and they had this hugely successful campaign where they

11:11.200 --> 11:12.390
actually ended up losing money.

11:12.400 --> 11:14.600
But that's beside the point.

11:14.650 --> 11:17.980
But you can see then amount raised per day.

11:17.980 --> 11:23.700
And for them that average line is resting around 250 K which is kind of ridiculous.

11:23.720 --> 11:28.750
And you don't have to expect that your project will do the same it doesn't need to to rank on the Kickstarter

11:28.780 --> 11:29.700
algorithm.

11:29.710 --> 11:36.610
Now of course if you think about it it's kind of a competitive sport ranking because the projects that

11:36.610 --> 11:38.910
show up there are only the active projects.

11:38.950 --> 11:47.140
So while it makes sense to put your project on Kickstarter at a hot season usually summer and right

11:47.140 --> 11:54.370
before Christmas it might also make sense for it to be on there at a slightly cooler season where there's

11:54.370 --> 12:02.830
less projects vying for that top space in Kickstarter and you do comparatively better in terms your

12:02.980 --> 12:05.520
number of pledges amount pledged per day.

12:05.710 --> 12:10.390
So what I would say is that before reaching your goal.

12:10.420 --> 12:13.630
The thing that matters is your percent funded.

12:13.690 --> 12:20.020
So before you reach your goal whether you are at 20 percent funded or 80 percent funded that is going

12:20.020 --> 12:25.090
to determine where you rank in Kickstarter to a large extent.

12:25.120 --> 12:29.800
But after you've reached that goal then it's more or less your funding amount.

12:29.800 --> 12:35.860
So the total amount of money that you have brought in through Kickstarter or Indiegogo that is going

12:35.860 --> 12:42.820
to help you rank because at the end the day when you analyze incentives for a platform which is all

12:42.820 --> 12:48.220
or nothing up to the point where you raise your goal it's all about how fast is that your reaching your

12:48.220 --> 12:48.960
goal.

12:49.120 --> 12:54.850
And the percentage of your goal that you've reached so even if your goal is like you know 100 pounds

12:55.330 --> 13:03.460
it makes sense that if you reach maybe 50 pounds within an hour that's half of your goal reached within

13:03.460 --> 13:04.770
a very short period of time.

13:05.020 --> 13:11.080
But after you reach your goal then it really is very much grinding against all of the other projects

13:11.110 --> 13:17.270
out there and these platforms like Kickstarter and Gogo are going to start looking at how much money

13:17.290 --> 13:20.740
you're going to bring them at the end of your project.

13:20.740 --> 13:26.890
So it's going to depend more on your funding amount and more specifically on your funding rates so funding

13:26.890 --> 13:28.380
amount of funding per day.

13:28.450 --> 13:34.150
Now another thing that we saw in the data that contributed towards ranking on the Kickstarter algorithm

13:34.570 --> 13:41.230
to some extent is the amount of campaign traffic so the amount of hits that your web site was getting

13:41.230 --> 13:42.110
per day.

13:42.310 --> 13:47.760
And this was really a small contribution from our data anyways.

13:48.100 --> 13:55.390
And that traffic is more or less and you control it depends on how many people you drive drive towards

13:55.390 --> 13:56.140
that page.

13:56.140 --> 14:00.820
So how much social media marketing you do how much content marketing how many cross-promotion you do

14:00.820 --> 14:07.420
with other campaigns whether here in a pig whether you paid for and whether you got any press and as

14:07.420 --> 14:11.690
I said we're going to cover all of these things and more in the traffic module.

14:11.710 --> 14:17.500
But obviously the more traffic the able to bring to your site and to Kickstarter and those people who

14:17.590 --> 14:22.190
might have never been on Kickstarter might end up discovering other Kickstarter project.

14:22.240 --> 14:26.590
It makes sense that if you're somebody who's pulling in a lot of that traffic that the platform should

14:26.590 --> 14:29.210
help promote you in their hour in them.

14:29.310 --> 14:35.860
And the final thing that we saw that contributed towards the ranking which you can control is the number

14:35.860 --> 14:37.220
of comments per day.

14:37.390 --> 14:44.290
So both in your updates and also in your main project there is an area where backers can comment on

14:44.290 --> 14:45.160
your project.

14:45.190 --> 14:50.980
Now if you're browsing through the Kickstarter platform and you see a project that has over 10000 comments

14:51.430 --> 14:58.180
after the project is finished that usually means that something terrible has happened to the backers

14:58.210 --> 15:03.170
or to the project where people are not getting what they want and they're mostly complaining on there.

15:03.460 --> 15:10.780
But during your campaign if you are seeing a lot of comments they tend to be encouraging comments or

15:10.780 --> 15:12.540
questions or queries.

15:12.730 --> 15:19.930
And that means that there's a lot of interaction on your project and it means that people are interested

15:20.050 --> 15:24.930
in your campaign which makes sense for it to be promoted higher.

15:25.030 --> 15:32.830
So if you look at the comments per day on Kulis Coola you can see that around the middle there there

15:32.830 --> 15:34.250
is a huge blip.

15:34.260 --> 15:39.470
For some reason where on one day they had almost 700 comments.

15:39.520 --> 15:45.940
And the reason for this is because they put out an update asking all their backers What are your favorite

15:45.940 --> 15:48.910
colors that you would like your cooler to come in.

15:49.120 --> 15:55.710
And you had maybe 700 backers who commented I want magenta I want fuchsia whatever it is.

15:55.750 --> 16:01.360
And that was an artificial way of basically getting people to comment on their project and help them

16:01.630 --> 16:04.100
rank on the popular algorithm.

16:04.150 --> 16:08.690
So this might be something that you might want to consider for your project as well you know.

16:08.770 --> 16:14.190
So the easiest thing is colors so you know if you're a hardware project then say you know what colors

16:14.200 --> 16:16.420
should we make the products in.

16:16.420 --> 16:23.350
Or if you are a jewelry project you know what are the most popular sizes for the jewelry whatever it

16:23.350 --> 16:23.800
is.

16:23.800 --> 16:29.080
Think about what you can do to try and get people to comment on your project.

16:29.200 --> 16:34.930
So a large part of commenting on Kickstarter is kind of our community building so it always makes sense

16:34.930 --> 16:40.620
for you as the creator to be responsive and to be reachable on the platform.

16:40.630 --> 16:46.330
So whenever somebody comment something you should always hit a reply and comment back just to show that

16:46.330 --> 16:51.010
you are present you are aware and it gives people confidence.

16:51.010 --> 16:56.500
People who have supported you based on just the video really giving you their money because they trust

16:56.500 --> 16:57.080
in you.

16:57.100 --> 17:01.810
You really have to do quite a bit of community building in the comments section to try and reassure

17:01.810 --> 17:06.800
people and to sort of group group your back is around you as a community.

17:06.850 --> 17:13.330
So when people feel like things are not happening when you initially projected them to be so this is

17:13.330 --> 17:18.710
usually after the project when youre not delivering on the days that you promised to deliver.

17:18.730 --> 17:25.020
People tend to get very upset unless you keep them updated regularly maybe on a weekly basis.

17:25.150 --> 17:31.090
So see the commenting section as a way of building community and keeping in touch with your backers.
