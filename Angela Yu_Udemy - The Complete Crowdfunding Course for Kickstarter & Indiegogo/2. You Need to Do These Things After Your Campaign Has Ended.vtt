00:00.630 --> 00:05.640
Now the next thing I want to talk about is what should you do after your campaign is ended so that you

00:05.640 --> 00:08.800
can continue generating presales.

00:08.940 --> 00:13.830
So one of the reasons why I tend to recommend people who want to go down the crowdfunding route especially

00:13.830 --> 00:21.300
reward based crowdfunding to go for a Kickstarter campaign is because Kickstarter has the largest amount

00:21.300 --> 00:21.980
of traffic.

00:21.990 --> 00:23.470
Largest number of backers.

00:23.550 --> 00:26.190
Therefore you're going to generate more revenue.

00:26.310 --> 00:33.750
Now afterwards though you can consider moving your completed Kickstarter campaign to Indy go go and

00:33.750 --> 00:36.450
continue running your campaign afterward.

00:36.690 --> 00:43.410
And this is because Indiegogo has a program called Indigo in demand and what that means is that actually

00:43.410 --> 00:45.920
your main crowdfunding campaign is finished.

00:45.960 --> 00:53.250
You can transfer all your data go Indiegogo and you can continue raising money for your product until

00:53.250 --> 00:55.360
the day that you're ready to ship.

00:55.380 --> 01:01.020
So there's a lot of people who do this and this is a recent project that we saw on Kickstarter called

01:01.080 --> 01:07.820
upright and go that helps you to fix your screen slouch and they raised over a million dollars on Kickstarter.

01:07.980 --> 01:13.610
And after their kickstarter ended they moved their project to Indiegogo under the in-demand category

01:14.190 --> 01:19.620
and they continued raising money on this platform until the day that they were ready to launch.

01:19.620 --> 01:24.660
Now maybe it might be that your perks on here are ever so slightly expensive like one or two dollars

01:24.660 --> 01:31.140
more expensive but it means that you can continue raising money until the day that you ship which can

01:31.140 --> 01:32.670
actually be quite significant.

01:32.670 --> 01:40.140
So if you compare this at the end of the Kickstarter project it was one million 118 thousand and now

01:40.140 --> 01:43.220
they're on one million two hundred forty five thousand.

01:43.290 --> 01:47.510
So that's another 100000 that was raised by having it on Indiegogo.

01:47.700 --> 01:51.110
So it's well worth considering putting your project on in demand.

01:52.360 --> 01:56.800
Now another thing that you should probably get familiar with especially if you're delivering physical

01:56.800 --> 01:59.450
goods is a tool called back pocket.

01:59.620 --> 02:06.440
Now it's well-known that Kickstarter is own backor information collection service is kind of poor.

02:06.640 --> 02:11.980
You only get to send your back as one survey and within that one survey they have to give you their

02:11.980 --> 02:14.850
name their address where they want it delivered to.

02:14.860 --> 02:19.720
They have to put in their selections for say if your product has different colors or if your product

02:19.720 --> 02:24.080
has different sizes then they have to put those in and they can't change it ever again.

02:24.100 --> 02:26.020
You can't send them another serving.

02:26.230 --> 02:29.680
So then there's a lot of e-mail back and forth Oh a moving address.

02:29.680 --> 02:32.340
Can you change my address.

02:32.350 --> 02:36.330
And you have to go into a spreadsheet and manually edited etc etc..

02:36.520 --> 02:39.940
So Bacchic it saves you from all of that hassle.

02:39.940 --> 02:45.650
You can send people surveys and they can log in to change those surveys at any point in time.

02:45.670 --> 02:52.270
They can also pledge for a tier above so they can they can put in extra money in order to upgrade their

02:52.270 --> 02:53.430
rewards.

02:53.590 --> 02:59.110
And also you can find their shipping address and they can update their shipping address when and as

02:59.110 --> 02:59.970
needed.

03:00.130 --> 03:06.430
So it's a really neat tool to help him manage all of your inventory and all of your post-campaign delivery

03:06.430 --> 03:13.860
problems now this is a really really important point you need to put out updates after your campaign

03:13.860 --> 03:14.920
has ended.

03:14.970 --> 03:22.410
If your delivery date is delayed or if anything that was not predicted happens any of the unknown unknowns

03:22.410 --> 03:23.040
happens.

03:23.220 --> 03:29.250
You have to show people what happened where you are at which stage you are of production because people

03:29.250 --> 03:32.990
on Kickstarter and Indiegogo have been burnt a lot of times.

03:33.060 --> 03:38.640
There have been a lot of creators who have run away with people's hard earned money and you have to

03:38.850 --> 03:42.880
do extra work in order to reassure people that everything's OK.

03:42.900 --> 03:48.150
You know and that unexpected things happen and people will understand they want to be in the loop so

03:48.150 --> 03:50.610
don't disappear off the face of the earth.

03:50.700 --> 03:54.620
So maybe just give people an update every two weeks or so.

03:54.660 --> 03:59.490
So as you can see with these guys they actually had some issues with the original hardware and they

03:59.490 --> 04:04.100
had to change some of the components which delayed the final shipping day.

04:04.110 --> 04:09.930
And this happens really really frequently but because they communicated this to their backers in a timely

04:09.930 --> 04:14.880
manner and explain themselves people weren't upset at all and they were totally understanding.

04:14.940 --> 04:20.040
And one of the nice things is that when you have a crowdfunding campaign you really do have a community

04:20.040 --> 04:23.340
around you people who support you and boost you.

04:23.340 --> 04:29.490
You know all the time and every time we put up day we had all these people who are so nice and so positive

04:29.820 --> 04:32.420
we're saying you know well done don't worry about it.

04:32.430 --> 04:33.810
You know keep going.

04:33.810 --> 04:36.270
Don't worry if it comes out late we don't mind.

04:36.270 --> 04:41.040
You know just keep up the hard work and it is always like you have a fan club who are rallying around

04:41.040 --> 04:41.290
you.

04:41.310 --> 04:44.550
And that kept you going during the darkest of times.

04:44.640 --> 04:46.420
And we're so so grateful for them.

04:46.440 --> 04:52.530
So make sure that you update people on what's going on and if you go on to Google even one of the auto

04:52.530 --> 04:58.480
suggest is Kickstarter runaway with money so you can see how prevalent this problem is.

04:58.530 --> 05:01.590
And a lot of people have been hurt by it before.

05:01.830 --> 05:07.620
And in fact if you look on Kickstarter a couple years back there was this project by this teenager who

05:07.620 --> 05:14.010
said he was going to teach people iPhone app development and wrote in a lot of people to pledge for

05:14.010 --> 05:15.260
him.

05:15.450 --> 05:17.990
And then he completely disappeared off the face of the earth.

05:18.030 --> 05:23.580
So the last update he put out saying that this is the final update for the release of course and that

05:23.580 --> 05:25.100
was in 2014.

05:25.110 --> 05:25.650
Right.

05:25.890 --> 05:28.630
And then he was never heard of again.

05:28.710 --> 05:33.720
And you see in the comments section there's like over a thousand comments of people just complaining

05:33.720 --> 05:37.770
and being very very upset and very angry about what he's done.

05:37.860 --> 05:42.340
Basically just running away with people's money and not delivering anything at all.

05:42.450 --> 05:48.300
And you actually see his dad going on there you know apologizing for his son and saying oh you know

05:48.300 --> 05:54.210
I'm so sorry Taylor really is a good boy but he's just done some bad things in life you know made some

05:54.210 --> 06:02.100
wrong choices and trying to fix his errors so there's a lot of these stories are really harrowing.

06:02.100 --> 06:07.890
So make sure that you really tell people what's going on and make sure that they realize that your project

06:07.920 --> 06:09.190
is not a scam.

06:09.360 --> 06:12.140
They can believe in you.

06:12.150 --> 06:18.090
Now another thing that you don't want to do is what pebble did so pebble raised $20 million on Kickstarter

06:18.510 --> 06:24.210
and then they announced to people that they were basically selling their company to Fitbit and they

06:24.210 --> 06:26.190
were going to cease all operations.

06:26.190 --> 06:30.510
Now the problem is that they put out an update telling people that you know some of the things that

06:30.510 --> 06:32.710
they pledged for people weren't going to get.

06:32.730 --> 06:37.260
So they were really excited about it but it's not going to be produced because the company is being

06:37.260 --> 06:38.100
sold.

06:38.100 --> 06:44.460
But in this update you see all these like happy smiley people placed next to these really sad bits of

06:44.460 --> 06:47.840
news like Pebble is seizing all hardware operations.

06:47.850 --> 06:51.070
We're no longer manufacturing promoting or selling a new product.

06:51.150 --> 06:57.210
But then you see these pictures of pebble staff looking all happy and the team posing for pictures and

06:57.210 --> 07:01.470
next is something like one to one pebble support is no longer available even though that's what people

07:01.470 --> 07:02.390
pledged for.

07:02.520 --> 07:04.640
And it riled up a lot of people.

07:04.640 --> 07:10.280
So make sure that when you do put an update if there are no unexpected delays or if there are problems

07:10.290 --> 07:17.410
make sure that you know you have like a corresponding tone Don't do this to rile people up.

07:18.000 --> 07:22.970
Now after your campaign has ended and after you've done all of your presales.

07:23.370 --> 07:28.470
Once you start manufacturing you have to consider all the various avenues that you're going to sell

07:28.470 --> 07:31.670
your products on and something that you might not be aware of.

07:31.680 --> 07:38.640
Is called Amazon launch pad and this is a place where you can that list your innovative crowdfunded

07:38.650 --> 07:42.740
ideas to be distributed and sold by Amazon.

07:42.750 --> 07:48.600
So a lot of people go on here to see what can I get right now that is launched on crowdfunding.

07:48.600 --> 07:50.440
But that is shipping right now.

07:50.490 --> 07:52.190
That's innovative and cool.

07:52.350 --> 07:57.990
So you can put your projects on here for consideration and it has to be a physical product.

07:57.990 --> 08:04.350
Now you could also just simply set up your own web site to sell your product after it's been crowdfunded.

08:04.350 --> 08:12.160
So you could use really simple tools like Shopify create your online store or something like wude commerce

08:12.160 --> 08:13.810
combined with wordpress.

08:13.930 --> 08:17.100
That will also create really beautiful online stores as well.
