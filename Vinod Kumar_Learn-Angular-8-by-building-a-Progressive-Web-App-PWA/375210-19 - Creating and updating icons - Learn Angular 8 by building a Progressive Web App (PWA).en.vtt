WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=LOCAL:00:00:00.000,MPEGTS:0

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.220
So one of the most important aspect off any application would be toe have proper logos and

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:16.100
icons on our manifest.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:21.410
That Web manifest currently refers toe assets icons on a bunch of icons.

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.890
So if you look at the assets folder icons,

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:25.160
all these icons,

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.800
basically all from angular,

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.040
so that says E.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.490
But in my case,

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.410
I want tohave icon specific toe my application,

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:33.920
which is called Moving Closer.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.270
Soto create a new icon.

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.180
What I do is I select the biggest size here,

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:41.740
which is Fight Will buy fight Well,

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.500
I want to create an image off my own.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.690
In case if you want a professional looking icons,

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:54.490
you can ask some freelance designers to create one for you from online platforms like fibre

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:55.260
dot com.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:55.980
However,

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.350
for my application,

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.750
I'm gonna create a very simple one using a keynote,

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.650
which is like Power point in Microsoft Windows.

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.910
So I'm gonna go here and then open keynote and then cleared a new document.

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:11.750
I select the default white one.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.100
The first thing I want to do is tow change the size of the document.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.570
I goto the slide size instead of standard.

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:27.340
I select the custom and I see your 412 by fine and 12 pixels are points is what I want When

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:28.880
I select that I got this.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:34.710
I don't need this text placeholders I'll goto format and as they change the monster toe the

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:35.440
blank one.

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.110
So I have here a blank fight will buy.

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.120
Fight will slide now I can create anything I want,

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.310
so I'm going to select a shape Let's elect the circular one.

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:53.570
I'm gonna make it a little bit bigger like this.

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.910
And then I duplicate the same toe Have one more.

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.980
But this time the color I will choose a different one,

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:05.940
probably for this filled with white Andi.

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:07.850
I have here something like this.

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:14.550
So now I can reduce the height off the same something that looks like this Lee around.

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.050
Keep it wherever you want.

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:21.860
And then I had a couple off characters.

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:28.750
Let's say I want one as capital them on the capital and let's increase the size of this

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:29.660
text toe.

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.950
Say,

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:30.720
for example,

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:31.650
500.

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.330
I find it is too big.

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.450
Let's make it as 400 maybe 350.

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.190
They should be okay,

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.950
so I'll place that somewhere here.

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.920
Maybe some more.

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:45.260
Don't.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:52.890
Maybe 300 pixels or big points should be fine on another one for Be.

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:58.050
So let's give the letter B a different color.

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.800
That's changes to read.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.060
Probably I can make it overlapping a bit like this.

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.850
I can have the same color for both of these,

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:10.690
like the blue one on that.

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.960
This would be also blue.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.160
In fact,

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.670
what I do,

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:26.300
they keep this in the same and say Am on then be so like this instead off probably 300.

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:29.430
So let's make it a smaller letter 250.

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.400
I think they should be okay for me.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.850
Now.

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.530
I have a slight that I can export as an image.

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.120
So what do they go here?

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.850
File export toe images.

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.690
All these options are dead in Microsoft ballpoint as well.

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.980
I goto export images.

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.090
I would like to export this to on my desktop.

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.810
I call this as movie browser.

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.100
I can't on export.

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:01.230
It's gonna create a folder and then you'll see that I got the movie pros and cons and this

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:02.350
is the image that we got.

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:04.150
It's a J pick fight.

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.520
Now that I have this one single J.

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.430
Pic file whose dimension is vital by fight Well,

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.530
I can use the same thing to gender it,

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:12.510
my icons,

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:13.860
so that ended the favor.

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:19.930
Icons off different dimensions that are required for browsers and mobile devices with it.

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:26.500
This website called Really save icon generator dot net All you do is you select your icon

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:27.080
image,

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:34.190
so I select this on I go to my desktop movie brother Icons select this geopark file open.

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:37.840
Now it is generating one for each type off platforms.

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.010
So this is how it's gonna look like on,

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:47.480
and I always device on this how it's going to look like on an android or Crume on a

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:48.940
Microsoft windows.

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:50.790
You can get this done like this.

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:51.810
So at the bottom,

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.290
I should have one generate option.

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:57.190
Generate your fair icons on Die html Court.

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:58.620
So when I click on this,

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:59.460
it's going toe.

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.170
Don't load me a zip file.

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:03.040
I think it's giving me a linker.

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.550
Download your packet.

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:05.420
It's gender dinner.

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:07.000
I think it is really no I.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.970
All I have to do is to click on this Onda download This probably on my desktop again until

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:14.770
the same ones that has come up.

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:16.800
So when I unzipped,

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.810
we have all the icons that are required for our application.

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:26.350
So let's go back to our desktop on DSI that there is a fair icon package.

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:27.490
There are 10 items.

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:28.460
When I opened this,

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:31.120
you can see that I got one for each one off them.

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:31.960
So fight.

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:32.310
Well,

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:36.120
1 92 Those are the two important one apple touch.

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.370
I conduct PNG favor icon 16.

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:41.520
30 Dubuffet work under icy will.

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.480
All the fights are they which we can now use in our application.

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:48.350
So I'm gonna select these images.

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:49.230
Copy that.

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:54.050
So I'm gonna just paste over here inside this SRC as its I can't.

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:57.460
I'm gonna based inside this so I can't see a based option.

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:01.780
It's disabled open in the reveal in Finder on.

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:08.760
But then I'm gonna based right here basics items Try to give your SRC sizes and the type I

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:10.960
just have to change the assesses off some of them.

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.270
For example,

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:13.930
the 1st 1 here,

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:21.830
the 1 90 to 1 92 each year instead of icon 1 92 by 1 92 It's actually called on dried

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:22.640
crumbs and say,

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:28.050
here on droid Crume Then we have here for fight Well,

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:28.960
we have the same thing.

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:34.390
So Android Crume Then we also are gonna have one apple touch.

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:36.050
So I don't have this three very force.

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:38.850
I'll remove this and type your apple touch.

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:43.700
The size happens to be 1 80 by 1 80 over here.

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:46.840
So these are the tree I'm using.

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:50.140
I believe the other ones I think I don't really require.

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:54.070
So let's go get it off this and set.

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:58.610
Now you can leave that as the default where there is an angular icon,

00:06:58.610 --> 00:06:59.700
so I don't need them.

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:04.320
I can also get it up the other icons which are originated over here.

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:07.260
So this is something that I got off my own.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:12.180
Nb That's to one thing that select all these fights which we don't need anymore.

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:13.690
I'm gonna get it off the same thing.

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:21.760
So now application is ready on day we have made all the necessary changes so we can now do

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:22.960
a build on,

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:23.740
then deploy
