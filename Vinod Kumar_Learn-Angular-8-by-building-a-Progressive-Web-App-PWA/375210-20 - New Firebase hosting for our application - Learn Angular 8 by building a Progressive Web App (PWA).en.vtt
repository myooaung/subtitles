00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.140
No,

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:09.840
the application is ready on.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.650
We want to deploy it on fire base.

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:14.500
I've logged into fire based on google dot com,

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.770
using one off my Gmail account on the link your toe goto console.

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:20.880
When I click on this chord cancel button,

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.730
it takes me toe the Fire based council where I can create a project,

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.820
manage project or delete if I want.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:35.670
Let's click on the Create Project on Let's type the movie browser as the name and it's

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.400
giving me some default name as a suggestion.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.380
I don't want this.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:40.400
I want to change this store.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.400
Something else.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.570
Let's give this,

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.370
as in G eight Dash Mori browsers.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:47.690
I don't need this part.

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.340
And if this is unique in the interview,

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.140
the community this is gonna be mine.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.210
I'm gonna click on Safe On That is done.

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:00.630
Let's click on Continue and it's asking for Do you want to enable the Google Analytics?

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.750
I don't want Google Analytics to be enabled.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.850
I click on Create the project.

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.530
All right,

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.790
so now that the project is really let's click on the continue button,

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.720
you have this project the project called Moving Closer.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.500
We have few options that we can do.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.420
Let's say if you look at this that an authentication database storage hosting So this is

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:24.570
what we are interested in?

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.550
What we want to do now is to push our cord over here.

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:29.370
Before this.

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.870
We have to initialize five based on our project location,

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:35.740
so I go back to the command prompt.

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.250
We are already in the movie brother directory.

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.970
All I have to do is tow,

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:40.480
say,

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:41.340
five dates.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.330
Locking on this is going toe.

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:44.520
Open the browser.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.220
It says You're firebase optionally collect cli usage.

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:48.700
It's a truck.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:49.960
Do you want to do that?

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:50.880
I'll say Yes,

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:51.380
I said,

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:52.050
Okay,

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.300
now it's asking me Toe sign in.

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.220
I want to sign in with this account.

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.220
It's basically allowing the firebase Eli toe publish on Alter my Projects.

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:01.970
That's okay.

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:02.570
And it is.

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:03.780
Logging is successful.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.110
I can click on this close.

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:06.440
Come back to the command front.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.870
It is lot Dennis quieter that we know at gmail dot com.

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:14.170
The next thing that I have to do is a issue.

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.870
A command called file based in it on.

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.200
This must be given in your project locations.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:19.930
If you're not sure,

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.450
so give a credibility.

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.780
Make sure that you're in the product directory.

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.510
This is our angular project on I'll say You're firebase minute.

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:28.690
When I pressed Enter,

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.740
it's gonna ask you a few questions.

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:32.250
Answered them carefully.

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.860
First,

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.000
it is which other five CLF feature you want to use.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.100
We have to choose them by using a donor here and then press space bar.

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.740
So the one that I'm interested in right now is the hosting.

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.260
So once it is done,

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.770
press enter another.

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:48.360
It says,

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.150
Do you want to use an existing project or create a new project?

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.920
So,

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:58.360
we just know created a new project on the fire breast console using the browser.

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.160
So we would like to use that existing project.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.340
So this is going to give me a list of all of them.

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.260
I have only one N G eight movie browser.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:07.250
That's what I want.

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.070
I press enter on.

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:10.370
Then it's gonna ask you,

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.720
which is your director that you want.

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:13.070
Oh,

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:14.790
publish toe five.

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:15.560
Best posting.

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.180
Now when you do an n g build,

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.110
which we'll do in the next to listen,

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:27.300
we get a folder called Dissed Onda inside that you will have a folder called movie browser

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.300
.

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:33.320
So we're going to specify that saying this slash movie dash browser.

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.570
If you're not sure whether this is the actual folder or not,

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:39.480
you can go to your actual applications.

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.180
Angular dot Jason You'll see that it says whenever you're doing a build,

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.090
this is the folder that it's gonna be dumping so distance slash movie browser.

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:50.820
So I'll go back to my terminal.

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.640
That is the name I pressed.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:53.330
Enter.

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.920
It'll ask you configure as a single page application.

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:56.350
Yes,

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:57.430
we want to do that.

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:58.940
So you say Yes,

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:00.050
your press enter.

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.800
Now,

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.140
if you look at the dist.

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:03.100
Folder here,

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:12.560
let's minus l slash movie Dash browser firebase has added one index dot html which is not

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.230
really required for us right now.

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.510
We're gonna build our angular project on that is going to sit in that location.

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.950
So that's do that by typing in g build on.

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:25.040
We want the production will weaken simply out here.

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:30.330
That's just fraud on this is automatically create a production really application.

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.250
So it was Enter.

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.770
This is gonna take a couple of minutes,

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.500
and at the end of this you will have all the artifacts that are required to be published on

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:40.490
your remote server.

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.780
On this include index are HTML,

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.440
CSS Files and JavaScript finds,

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.360
along with the Assets folder,

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.290
such as icons and Images.

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:55.680
So finally,

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.340
we have got all the artifacts,

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:57.800
really.

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:05.690
So if I just clear the screen and then go and like three dist slash movie browser press

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:06.310
enter,

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:10.040
you can take these other files that have been generated.

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:13.660
So there's 1/3 party license and start next the asset,

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:15.810
consisting off icons and images.

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:17.570
Then there is a favorite Kander.

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:24.110
I see well that an index HTML and all other JavaScript files which are required for our

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:25.150
application to run.
