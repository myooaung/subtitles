00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.200
no jeans forwards a platform where we can compile our angular application on a development

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:13.900
Web server.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.800
Also do some building off our application.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.350
Nor Jace is only a development requirement,

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:23.150
which means once your application is developed,

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.830
built on deployed to a production server,

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.350
Norges is no longer a requirement.

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:33.160
Your angular application can be deployed on any https there were,

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.320
such as Apache Norge,

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.330
a serval are by tons over our.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.040
If you come across with any other HDTVs artwork,

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.850
you can try the blowing your application on the same environment to install Norges first

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:46.350
with it,

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.790
nor J start on,

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.360
and it will take you to this homepage.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:51.150
Very see.

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:55.710
Big Two buttons once is recommended for most users,

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.220
which is called long term support 12 or $14.0 at the time of recording here.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.240
There's also the current version 13.5 dot zero,

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:07.530
with latest features probably not stable yet.

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.970
We will go with a 12 or $14.0.

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.150
So I click on this.

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.460
Let me keep it on my downloads folder.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.420
Save this once the packages don't wrote it.

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:20.140
I'm going toe.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.450
Start installing the respect of the operating system.

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.330
Your chosen Windows.

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:27.960
Mac wars are leaners.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.560
This step is gonna be seen.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:30.620
It's a wizard.

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.050
So let's get continue.

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.250
Accept the license agreement.

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.670
You can change the installation location,

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.250
but I would like to leave it to the default location.

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.910
Click on install in case with us for the administrator Password,

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:46.150
please provide the same thing.

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:51.810
Click install software and wait for the reserve toe.

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.710
Complete the installation process.

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.260
Once this is done,

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:56.950
let's get it off this dialog box.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.570
I don't need this package for which got downloaded,

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:01.850
so I will delete that.

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.520
Now the installation is done.

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.500
I can open a new terminal on windows.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.180
You call this s command prompt.

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:15.740
So I'm gonna open the terminal here and then look for North Dash.

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.480
We are north dash dash portion.

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.330
So it was the washing that I've been start to alert.

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.870
$14.

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:23.250
Go.

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.520
Norges also comes with a couple of other utilities.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.190
One is called np again,

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.510
which is no package manager.

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.420
The washing off that happens to be six start 13.4,

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.870
which happens to be the latest in case If you will see an older Russian after in telling

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:41.650
nor Jace,

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.790
you can also upgrade the North Package manager using the North Package Manager itself.

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:47.450
To do so,

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.970
you might have to say NPM update dash G for Global.

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:52.540
And then again,

00:02:52.540 --> 00:03:00.090
say NPM So we're actually using the NPM command toe update a global package called NPM on

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.500
Windows.

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.440
This command will do just like this,

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.190
but on Lenox,

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.750
Andi Mack or his human also have to get a pseudo permission.

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.590
This actually asked for the password.

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.880
Andi wants them done with this.

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.220
It should show the same washing six.

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:17.950
Start 13.4.

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.680
So check it again by typing in PM Dutch Free and you'll see the same Washington.
