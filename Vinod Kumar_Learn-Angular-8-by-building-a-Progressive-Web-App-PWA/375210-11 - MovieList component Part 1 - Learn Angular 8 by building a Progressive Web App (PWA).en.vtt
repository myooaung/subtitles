WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=LOCAL:00:00:00.000,MPEGTS:0

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.210
know that we have this header which can accept a text here on then,

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:14.340
when people enter,

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.840
what we want is we want this particular place to be displayed with all the movies that

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.220
match that quiet.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:20.550
Um,

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:21.840
for example,

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.880
if you take the world spider and press enter,

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.570
we want the list off movies that have the world spider in their title.

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.020
Such a Spider Man.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:32.810
Obviously,

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:38.280
we want to create a new component over here on the Let's call this as a movie list

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.020
component.

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.130
So let's go back toe the line front Onda.

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:44.040
Not that I'm in the work directory.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.850
That's the project director here.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:52.190
And I let it like you're NGC for generate component and then components is the forger.

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:52.440
Wait,

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.600
I want this new component on the name of the component I'm gonna give is movie dash list.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:05.670
So this is going to create a typescript class called more realist component onda associated

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.270
four for it to be day and it also updates the at model ts.

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.870
Let's go back to our cord and see what happened.

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:18.010
Let me close all the open text fights now under components.

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:20.000
Now you see that there is a header folder.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.220
There's a home folder.

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:22.630
There is a movie this border.

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.190
The movie is folder contains a class,

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.080
and we did not use any of the classes so far.

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:34.410
So this time we're gonna create some valuables here so that those variables can be used in

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:36.360
the HTML also.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:36.960
Currently,

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.800
our APP component extreme El is displaying the at home so temporarily just to see the

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:43.370
results.

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:52.150
Let's commit this out and then type your APP movie list so that we are actually going to

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:57.820
see the movie list component over here Now the link between the header component and the

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:03.290
moralists component we will establish a bit later because that involves passing the text

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.820
value from here to a different component.

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:06.480
Also,

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.470
I want to see a different Europe here.

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:14.130
So let's go back to your cord and make the necessary changes in the HTML corresponding toe

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.150
this particular movie list.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.980
So the movie list should display the details off the movies on.

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.670
I should have some movie object in angular.

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:31.070
The component class may define a valuable here with some values on the HTML can access the

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.660
same thing.

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:32.140
So,

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.280
technically speaking,

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:39.150
this acts like the controller off the component and this actually the view off the

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.880
component.

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:40.910
For example,

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.580
if I go back to the tears and declare a variable here called say,

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:55.180
type two off some string day and then I can assign this toe movie list here on and I can

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:02.800
access this title in the HTML using what is called interpolation operator are simply called

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:03.680
handlebars.

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.330
So I go to the HTML and then get it off.

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.830
This type probably hitched three.

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.410
And inside the history,

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.830
I use a double curly bracket and use the valuable title.

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.310
So this class defines the variable.

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.320
We call it a model.

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.100
Data on this HTML,

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.060
which is a view,

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.330
can access the modern later in this fashion.

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:24.040
Say,

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.370
if I go back over here now,

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.670
you can see it is moving list here.

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.990
We don't want this title,

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:32.360
but instead we want the list off movie.

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:38.910
So what we're gonna do is we're gonna define a variable called movies off an array type.

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.220
And if I don't know the did it,

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.800
I I can simply say any on then declare on Alec.

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.250
So we have declared the variable called movies,

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:47.780
but it is still undefined.

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.590
So I may not be able to use them.

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.950
So to initialize this movies,

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:58.370
I can use the constructor because the angular clears an instance off this class.

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:59.370
During that time,

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.950
I can initialize this particular movies Variable,

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.460
all angular,

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:06.780
has a lifecycle function called in G on in it.

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.550
This minute angular has not only instance hated the class,

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:11.770
but it also has made.

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:15.220
This is a component now and the component has been loaded onto the U.

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.300
E.

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.300
Now we can initialize this over here.

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:20.190
Technically speaking,

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:25.730
the value off those movies should be dynamically initialized based on the value we have

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:29.930
entered in the search box over here so that we will do a bit later.

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:31.230
But for the time being,

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:35.770
let's say we can initialize the movies valuable using a dummy.

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:37.390
So I can say,

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:39.650
here this stop movies,

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:45.210
all the member variables and member methods you can only access using the Discover equals

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.640
two.

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.610
I'm gonna copy and paste a bunch off values over here.

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:50.160
So,

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:50.800
for example,

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:51.750
if you look at this,

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.740
this is an array off three objects.

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.560
Each object has a property con title.

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.830
Your poster with some values over here.

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:06.470
Andi know What I want to do is I want toe access this movies in my HTML.

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:07.280
So what?

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:07.750
I can do it.

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:12.160
I can go back over here on Let's get off this temporarily.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.490
I can print the title off the movie.

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:15.240
For example.

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.030
It's I want access.

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:20.580
The first movie I can see Your traitor is nothing but incoming record.

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:28.460
I can say movies off zero because movies is they are a were accessing the first element dot

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:30.050
title like this.

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:35.670
Make sure that the property names are spelled in appropriate cases like uppercase lowercase

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:36.390
combination.

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:38.420
I have t capital or here,

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:45.720
so I have to use the same thing so likewise I can also use something like you colon movies

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.150
off zero Don't.

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:57.350
If I want toe actually display the image I can type your I am G a class off I m g and then

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:03.650
I m g tamponade via score is going to give me an image with SRC equals to all vehicles to

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:04.250
Exeter.

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:09.790
What I can do is I can use a calibrated just like the same thing over here that also will

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:10.370
work.

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:11.180
For example,

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:16.990
if a copy this one thing and then paste or inside this double course and then type your

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:17.520
poster.

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:21.020
They should display the actual image as well.

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:24.290
I'm gonna copy this title and then put that for art.

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:24.860
Andi,

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:29.520
I should be able to see the first movie details like this so you can see that I got the

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:30.150
title.

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:32.680
I got the year I got the poster as well.

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:33.640
However,

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:40.160
using this double curly brackets inside attributes looks ugly on dancer.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.800
Sometimes it's very difficult to understand what we have returned over here.

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:46.060
Soto solve this problem.

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:50.970
I can just assign the actual JavaScript expression like this.

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:54.720
But then to tell angular that this is an expression and another string,

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:57.850
you have to use a square bracket over here.

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:03.220
So all we're doing here is that we say that the value assigned toe SRC attribute is not a

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:03.900
string,

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:05.470
but a job was kept expression.

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:09.000
And this JavaScript expression happens to be a radar property.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:09.590
Likewise,

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:13.470
I can do the same thing for aren't so This is the alternate text in gives it.

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:17.030
The movie image is not available at this point in time,

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:20.110
so it's gonna be the ultimate text that's gonna be dispute over here.

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:22.420
So Now that I have got like this,

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:23.420
I can go back.

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:24.210
You can still see.

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:31.020
The result is the same thing so I can go here and change all the zeros toe once like this

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:31.790
on day.

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:32.960
Now if a come back here,

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:36.150
you should see now the second movie object.

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:42.610
But what we also want to do is we want to access on these movies from this particular list

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:45.200
because this can be an array off three right now,

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:47.160
but it can be an array of 10 later,

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:50.500
so we want to dynamically loop through this.

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:51.640
For this,

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:59.150
we have another option where we can get a variable called Let's Say I Am where m represents

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:04.100
a single movie now in orderto loop through and get each off this objects,

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:05.120
I'll go to the beginning.

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:07.950
I can just put do here on day,

00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:12.890
then say that this deal should repeat for the actual movies,

00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:18.530
collection or movies addict and for that angular provide something called the Directive.

00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:19.300
Ah,

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:25.160
Director is something that can be used on any elements that you have like an HTML element,

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:25.950
for example,

00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:28.510
Right now I am using the deal element,

00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:34.440
but I can actually use this on a u l L I or any other element that each demon supports.

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:40.200
So I can simply go here and then say your star n G four equals two,

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:44.920
and then I will type an expression that loops through the collection.

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:50.040
So the expression goes something like this Let em off movies.

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:54.050
So what we're doing here is we're creating a new variable called em.

00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:57.900
But that is made out off this movie's collection.

00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:00.840
So M takes a single element first time.

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:02.140
So it is going in a sequence.

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:03.660
So it takes the first movie,

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:07.450
and then I can push this court inside that.

00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:14.010
So I'm gonna cut this and based over here and now you can see that using this 1st 2 movie

00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:17.420
were actually processing the whole thing and then go back this,

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:18.880
then take the second movie,

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:20.430
were displaying the second movie.

00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:21.190
Then we go back.

00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:22.440
It takes the third movie,

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:24.200
and then we're displaying the third movie,

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:24.610
Andi,

00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:25.450
continuously.

00:09:25.450 --> 00:09:28.650
It repeats until all the movies has been processed.

00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:29.350
Right now,

00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:31.020
I only have three of them safe.

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:32.070
Go back over here.

00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:33.780
I see the 1st 1 over here.

00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:36.430
2nd 1 on the 3rd 1 over here.

00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:42.180
So if you have a collection off movies and this is how you will be able tow display the

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:42.710
same thing,

00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:46.120
how are in orderto make this look nice?

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:53.260
Let's use something called a card layout So I can say that this deal happens to be a car so

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:58.570
I can say plastic goes to card and a card has something called as a car body.

00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:01.800
So let's start on all these three in the car bodies.

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:08.230
I'm gonna take your card dashed body and push this down somewhere here so that our car body

00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:13.130
contains all the three elements on inside off title like this,

00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:18.690
I can change this toe a h five with a class off something called card title.

00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:21.020
We don't want to say that this is tighter.

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:22.930
People will understand this anyways,

00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:25.440
so this is supposed to be a slash h five.

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:27.210
We have the year.

00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:28.900
I don't have to tell that this is any other.

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:31.660
People will realize that it's in here and I haven't.

00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:32.070
I am.

00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:34.300
GSR sees nothing but the poster.

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:37.450
There's an alternate text class equals toe.

00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:39.090
We have something called Come Nail,

00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:43.450
but instead I can use a card specific class name called Card.

00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:44.850
I am G Top.

00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:47.980
So we have this card already right now.

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:49.770
So if I go back to the browser,

00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:50.410
you should know,

00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:52.260
See that there is a card.

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:55.610
The car occupies the complete with available,

00:10:55.610 --> 00:11:01.890
but what I can do is I can actually make all off them flow in a single rope.

00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:02.830
So if you remember,

00:11:02.830 --> 00:11:05.850
we have a row column concept in booster.

00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:12.130
We can say that there is a row that can contain a maximum off three cells so that each SL

00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:17.850
occupies a grid off four because four into three wastrel onda Rosales eastward.

00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:24.360
So what I can do is now I can surround the whole thing now with something like role with

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:27.660
something called dot call MD.

00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:28.410
Four.

00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:31.540
So in a medium device that has laptop screens,

00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:35.550
it's going to be a three cell or three column layout.

00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:38.060
But in a small device.

00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:40.560
I can also say that in a small device,

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:44.830
it should only show two cards instead off three of them,

00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:48.390
so that each column occupies six grapes.

00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:55.210
I can also be more specific and said dot call excess 12 But if you don't mention in an

00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:56.750
extra small device.

00:11:56.750 --> 00:12:01.350
It's always going to be 12 but nonetheless that give this 12 press enter.

00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:07.370
Now we can see that I have one role here with any number of columns in it and each of these

00:12:07.370 --> 00:12:07.980
columns,

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:11.130
I can just cut this and place that inside.

00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:16.840
You can see that we can convert these two teams into a same because this still doesn't have

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:18.300
anything other than a car.

00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:26.330
So I'll have to do is tow at this particular class name toe this itself car space,

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:32.710
all the column land and this do on the corresponding closing do I don't need this anymore.

00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:34.750
That's also former the theme.

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:36.150
Go back to the Broza,

00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:37.050
another agency.

00:12:37.050 --> 00:12:43.740
We have something like this where each of the movies are displayed like this one last thing

00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:51.190
we will also do is probably we can surround this section the car body using a different

00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:51.630
color,

00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:52.330
for example,

00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:59.910
I can say here dot alert dot alert family s so it's gonna give it a nice little background

00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:00.550
for the same.

00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:01.990
So if I go back here now,

00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:05.570
you should see that there is a different color on together.

00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:07.800
You can also check it out different color schemes.

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:08.330
For example,

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:09.380
instead of primary,

00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:10.870
I can take say,

00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:11.940
for example,

00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:12.650
in four,

00:13:12.650 --> 00:13:16.950
and that's gonna bring the same color as the header like this are.

00:13:16.950 --> 00:13:19.500
You can change toe say success,

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:23.150
warming danger to check it out in different colors.

00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:24.450
For example,

00:13:24.450 --> 00:13:28.860
let's say when I use this primary and if I don't like this color combination,

00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:31.470
I can even change to a different boots.

00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:33.980
Watch link so I can go toe boots.

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:37.650
Watch dot com scrawled on toe a different team.

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:42.840
I can see that the primary actually came orange because off this color combination is the

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:43.950
one that I have chosen.

00:13:43.950 --> 00:13:45.520
If you want a different one,

00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:46.480
for example,

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:49.530
let's say I want to take up.

00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:50.920
Say this darkly.

00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:57.080
I can select this right click on this bootstrap men dot CSS Copy the Link address.

00:13:57.080 --> 00:14:00.380
Come back to our style daughter CSS.

00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:08.140
So I go toe style start CSS changed this Europe from the current one superhero to the one

00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:09.290
which is darkly.

00:14:09.290 --> 00:14:10.940
If I come back over here now,

00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:13.430
you can see that it's totally a different one.

00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:17.510
I would like you to try out different teaming options using boats,

00:14:17.510 --> 00:14:17.950
watch
