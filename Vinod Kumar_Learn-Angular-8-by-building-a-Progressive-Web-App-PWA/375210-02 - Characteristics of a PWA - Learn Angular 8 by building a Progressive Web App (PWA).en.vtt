00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.130
in order for about application to qualify as a progressive about it must fulfill some

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:15.770
baseline characteristics in this sector.

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:18.040
We will distance these characteristics one by one.

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.440
Number one,

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:24.410
the site must be served or hits to TPS instead of hits TTP.

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:25.210
As you can see,

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:30.500
the application that we're gonna build has that feature already and we are making use off

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.790
Google Fire base for the same.

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.150
So if you look at the certificate over here,

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.460
you can see that the certificate has been issued to fight was at dot com and you can see

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.040
some details about the same as well number toe.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.480
The pages must be responsive on tablets and mobile devices.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.920
We are going to use CSS framework called bootstrapped from Twitter,

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.150
which helps us design our application in a responsible manner.

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:55.120
For example,

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.310
if I goto this particular page over here,

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:00.350
this is how we see this on the browser.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.440
But if oppressed after well and go to the developer concern where have enabled the device

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:05.970
toolbar?

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:13.310
And I'm seeing my application on an simulated iPhone 678 and you can see that the list off

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.390
movies which were displayed as agreed,

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.250
that now it shows one below the other.

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.560
If I change the device from iPhone toe,

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.550
let's an iPad and you see now I'm able to see it in a different way.

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:31.950
The third aspect of a progressive about these all appearance should lower while offline.

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.750
So our application,

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:34.500
for example,

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.420
if I'm on the home page if I goto offline,

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.080
if I turn off my WiFi and then if I refresh,

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.450
you can see that the APP is rendered without any problem.

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.990
Of course,

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.770
the searching off the movie,

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.170
based on a keyword,

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.150
may not display any result.

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.640
But I'm not getting any other message assets that you don't have an Internet connection.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.180
My application is still running without the Internet connection,

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.650
but as if I visited websites like YouTube dot com,

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.350
you can see that I get no Internet at a message.

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:12.030
We can handle that even here also on display a custom user friendly error message saying

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.790
that you are currently offline.

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:20.980
All you can also cash the results off some off these movies offline and then present the

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:26.140
same thing to the user back on land.

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.920
So if I refresh,

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.380
I should be able to see the results.

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:29.090
Once again,

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.440
Number four feature off a progressive Web application.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.410
Is it?

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.650
Should have moderator provided for Acto home screen.

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:37.370
Well,

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.720
this is applicable for mobile device.

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.170
Even on a desktop,

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.750
you can see that I have a plus icon here.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.770
Taking on this icon gives me an option toe install app.

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:49.790
You see an icon over here,

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.240
you see a name as the less the location from where this gets install.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.140
If I click on install on Crume,

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.440
it will be installed as an AB on the chrome.

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:05.880
So I can as well with it the Ural Crume Poland slash,

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:12.050
slash ABS and you should see an application called MB or movie browser Over here.

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.350
I also have a couple of other applications over here.

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.840
All of which the progressive of applications are here.

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.000
Number one is angular.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.120
Five base PW,

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.770
etcetera.

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:25.060
That the photo Pia that the capital that angular?

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.000
So these are some of the application that I've installed.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.930
Now I have the movie also so clicking on this will open the application in a separate

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:34.650
window.

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:35.330
Basically,

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:40.250
this is behaving like a standard on application on your desktop or laptop.

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.780
If you open your website using Crume on your android phone,

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.640
you should see a pop up that comes and says Acto home screen.

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.040
And this is possible,

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.350
using a matter data provided along with their application.

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:55.170
Number five feature off.

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:01.790
A progressive application is the First Lord must be forced even on a three g network.

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:06.880
And this is ensure using our angular single page Web application concept,

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.910
where the initial component is typically the home component like this,

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:13.450
which are very light to it as well.

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.720
You can do something called lazy.

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:21.110
Loading off components on this feature is very much forwarded by angular itself.

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:24.650
Number six Site Works Cross browser,

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:29.990
which means your application must work on different process in the same fashion.

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.970
For example,

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.670
your application should be here the same whether it is on chrome.

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:36.030
Microsoft Age.

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:36.920
Firefox,

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:39.080
our safari and angular,

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.950
ensures that our application runs on all these browsers seamlessly.

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:49.150
Number seven page transitions don't feel like they block on the Internet.

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:53.200
The transition should feel snappy as you type around,

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:54.790
even on a slow network,

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:57.240
a key toe perceived performance.

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:02.620
This is achieved by developing a single bit application or a client rendered application

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:07.320
where a user when transits from one page to another page,

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:12.000
we must show a skeleton screen at least on use Any contents?

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.620
It s title thumbnail something that is readily available instead of waiting for the entire

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:18.600
data to be loaded.

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:26.270
Eight on final basic characteristics off a progressive of application is that every page

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:27.990
should have its own urine.

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:32.100
This is to ensure that unusual pages on deep link herbal.

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:38.170
Why are the euros on the euros are unique for the purpose off share ability on social media

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:38.170
,

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:39.710
for example,

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:44.160
we are in the home page over here that has a different urine for itself.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.480
When I type something and press enter here,

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:51.610
you can see that the U R shows this The reason for this separate your lists.

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:58.180
Now I can copy this and share it to someone where a email are different means on when they

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:59.760
click on that particular Europe,

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:02.400
they should be able to see the similar result as well.

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:03.380
Similarly,

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:05.420
when I select a particular movie over here,

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:07.680
you can see that I have this particularly oral.

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:10.610
I should be able to copy this and share it with someone.

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:14.520
So when they opened that particular ling by clicking on the hyperlink,

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:17.770
they should be ableto see the same result as mine.

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:22.890
When you don't look about publication on you intended that application to be a progressive

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:28.110
about you can always check whether it has met all these baseline features.

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:30.900
By going toe the developer concern,

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:34.790
there is a section called Audit On.

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:40.220
Then you can run an audit and one of the feature that you can test whether your application

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:43.550
is progressive about or not is mentioned over here.

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:44.630
And at the end,

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:46.530
when our application has been developed,

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:50.050
we will use this tool called Light Owes Toe check the theme.
