00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.680
Now that our application you ready?

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:10.950
Let's go on.

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:18.130
Stop the war and add the credibly features toe our application to do so.

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:20.830
All we have to do is to issue one command,

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.790
which is N g ad that angular slash pw.

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:30.700
What this is going to do is it's gonna add a couple of dependencies.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:35.500
It gendered few artifacts and then updates our application.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.830
So let's go and see that again.

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.240
This may take more time on windows,

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.850
depending on your configuration off your machine.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.350
Okay,

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.060
so in my case,

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.480
it has done in couple of minutes adding 21 packages.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.770
But if I see in the beginning,

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.070
I see what are the files that have been generated?

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.540
One of the most important one is the N G s W.

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:59.120
Conflict.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:00:59.810
Jason.

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:01.760
There's also manifest file.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.740
This is the one that consists off certain information for mobile devices.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:06.950
A lot off icons.

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:08.510
They're all angular icons.

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.820
We may have to gender all the necessary icons.

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:12.860
Most importantly,

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.720
the 1 92 by 1 90 to fight will buy fight well,

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.570
So these are the two important ones.

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.200
There is also a Nikon for apple touch.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.700
There's also a couple of fights being updated over here,

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.310
you can see that there's an angular Jason back.

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.960
His Georgeson,

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:28.430
of course,

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.400
is updated with all the new dependence is at Model.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.990
TS has been updated,

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.180
indexed or extreme,

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.310
and also has been updated over here So forth.

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.530
Let's go and have a look at What are the updates that have been done?

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.210
Let's go to our application folder.

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.820
Let's close all the open files first.

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.200
That's going to have a look at angular Jason on in angular Jason.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.960
If you go to the configurations for production.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.830
If his deeds crawled on a bit,

00:01:54.830 --> 00:02:02.060
yer you can see it's a service worker is true and then Engy service worker conflict Part is

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.830
in G s W conflict are Jason's that this was not there earlier.

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:07.050
Now it has been updated.

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.400
The second find that we can look at is our package Georgeson.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.700
The dependence is have been updated in the packaged or Jason.

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.290
This is the one that has new living installed.

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.690
So at Angulo's last Saturday's worker,

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.110
then you have the app module doctor years.

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:30.050
So the app model dirty s is under SRC have modeled our tears.

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:35.230
You'll see that it has imported probably couple off modules so that the service worker

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.850
model so you can see it has added to our import section.

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:44.920
Service worker model dot register a file called NGS really worker dot Js has been added

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:45.530
over here.

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:46.470
And of course,

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.450
the the final one is the index dot html itself has been updated.

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.070
Where you see some information about the manifest,

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.150
this one is required for mobile devices.

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.300
So when you open this application in the mobile phone,

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.620
it will say at the home screen on when you Acto home screen,

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.180
what is that I can tow be displayed on the home screen on those information will be there

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.080
in the manifest our web manifest.
