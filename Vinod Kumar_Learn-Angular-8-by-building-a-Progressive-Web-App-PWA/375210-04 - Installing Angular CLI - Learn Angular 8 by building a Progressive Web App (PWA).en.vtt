00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.980
starting from angular four.

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:15.650
Angular comes with a command line interface that allows us to create a new application.

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.680
I had a new components services,

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.990
directors and any other angular artifacts.

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.850
So this is called angular.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.070
See a line on.

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.160
Do we have to install this at the global level?

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.470
So I'm gonna use pseudo comment on macro is you don't need sudo for Windows.

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:40.720
You just type npm install G followed by at angular slash C L a.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.220
The ones you press enter,

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:47.760
it's gonna take a while on windows on Mac Warriors and lean it's This could be a little bit

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:48.360
faster,

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.310
probably because Norges waas initially intended only for Lennox Platform.

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:56.700
So the angular cli Once it is installed,

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.220
we will be able tow run.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.360
A command called N G on N G has a lot of options.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:03.210
For example,

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.150
Engy new followed by name will clear a new project with that name.

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.340
And if you want to start a development server,

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.310
you might have to say N g sir,

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:13.110
as you can see,

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.110
that in my case,

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:14.510
angular,

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.780
see,

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.290
like eight door treated 21 has been in start.

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.610
Let me clear this cream and they in G danced s worship.

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:28.160
This is going to show me the angular Russian as well s nor Jace on a couple of other

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.670
Russians.

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.190
As you can see over here to get some help,

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:36.850
you can always take n g help and that will tell you n g available commands.

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:37.810
For example,

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:44.270
engine new here creates a new workspace and an initial angular app in geezer built

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.940
themselves.

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:51.790
The up rebuilding files on changes engine tests to run the test cases that are currently

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:58.740
available in your project n g build aloes is toe compiler and their project onto an output

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.560
territory so that we will be able to deploy that on toe a remote server.
