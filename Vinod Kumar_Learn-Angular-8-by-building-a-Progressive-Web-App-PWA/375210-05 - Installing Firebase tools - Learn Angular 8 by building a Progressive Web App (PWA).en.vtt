00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.430
In order for deploying our application,

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:14.670
we will make use off fire base from Google Fireworks,

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.680
Probert's hosting service,

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.130
which allows us to expose our web application using hits https,

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.510
which is a secure socket layer.

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:25.060
Now,

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.660
this is important from our PW a point off you.

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.400
So to install the same,

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:37.440
you have tow issue the command NPM install dash G because it's gonna be a command.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.760
So we're going to say firebase tach tools on windows.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.800
This command will do but leaners and McQuay's request the pseudo So when I pressed Enter

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.040
ask for the password.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.350
I'm gonna enter the password.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.980
And now this is gonna install the five best tools globally so I can issue the command from

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:55.290
anywhere I want.

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.810
Once the five best tools is installed,

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:01.010
you will be able to lock onto your fire based console,

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:02.320
La goat kid.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:08.670
New projects deploy your current projects on toe you're hosting service Are if you have any

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:09.950
data basis over there,

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:10.760
you will be able tow,

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:11.250
connect,

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.100
initialize.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.670
A lot of things you can do with this at this time,

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.080
we're only going to install the fireplace tools on one's.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.600
Our application is ready for deployment we will initialize the fire based on deploy our

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.880
angular application on the firebase.

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:31.750
