00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.220
Hello and welcome to my courts.

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:15.040
Don't angular eight by building progressive about my name is we know on.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.980
I'll be your instructor for this course.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:23.730
I have over 23 years off training experience in I T Industry and trained hundreds of

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.350
thousands of software engineers.

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.700
This course primarily focuses on two things.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:29.690
Number one,

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:31.860
learning angular Number two.

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:34.030
Creating a progressive Web application.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:40.750
Angular is one of the most popular framework for developing mobile on Web applications.

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:46.590
Current washing off angular as off this recording is a door to about 15 however,

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.310
even for future Russians,

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:52.710
the framework is simply called angular without being referred to its abortion.

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.450
If you ever hear it would angular Js,

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.340
it corresponds to abortion Wonder eggs,

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.920
which is completely different from angular two onwards,

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.170
which are simply turned us angular.

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.740
Before we begin.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.410
Let's have a look at what we are going to develop.

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:09.760
Why learning angular?

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.290
Here is the Ural Off or Application,

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.120
which is hosted on something called Five Minutes,

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:21.480
which is from Google are application has a header where the title I can click on that toe

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.250
come to this page called home Pitch.

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.760
The textbooks very concerned for movies on the home page displays my picture.

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.690
The title of Your application,

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.150
which is angular PW demo application.

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:39.480
Devil it by my name link to my website on There is a basic copyright information about my

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:40.350
application.

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.480
I can go to the search box and search for movies.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.960
Let's say,

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:45.540
for example,

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:45.850
later,

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.490
Jerry Press enter.

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.810
You should see a list of movies which contain the world Jerry in the title.

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.720
When I click on a particular movie,

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.460
I should be able to see a Progress bar and the details of the movie,

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.200
such as Director Plot.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.840
Your etcetera are shown clicking on the back button.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.850
I should be able to maybe get back toe the previous speech.

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:08.840
Apart from that,

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.050
our application also is install able on the device.

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.800
For example,

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:13.870
on Google Groom,

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.570
I have got chrome colon APS.

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:21.440
You'll see that my application movie browser has been installed,

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.060
taking on that it will launch a standalone washing off my application,

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.590
which works just fine.

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.140
So if you look at Spider,

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.940
for example,

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.150
I get all the movie started last fighter.

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:33.800
Even on a mobile device,

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:39.860
I should be able to install this AB as a standalone application without having to open

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:40.800
where a browser.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:46.710
The application is fast because the HTML CSS JavaScript corresponding to our application

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:47.840
has been cashed.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.540
Our application also works off line to some extent,

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.850
such as displaying the home page of your application.

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:02.020
Are loading the components that doesn't require any data from arrest in point without any

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.830
further delay,

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.750
let's start learning about angular on progressive applications.
