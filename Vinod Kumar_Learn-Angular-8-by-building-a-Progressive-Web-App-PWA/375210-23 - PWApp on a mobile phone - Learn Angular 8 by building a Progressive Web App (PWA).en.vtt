This is my android phone where I've got chrome I'm gonna click on the chrome toe,

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:16.170
open a new tab and in the new tab,

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:22.330
I'm gonna search for N G eight dash movie browser dot firebase after come.

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.200
So since they're already searched one city state here,

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.400
I'm gonna press search and the first thing that you can notice is at the bottom.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:36.130
You have this ad movie Broza toe home screen when I select that it will confirm whether

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.480
should I add or not so at the home screen ad,

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.240
and then it is adding toe the home screen and on the top you can see here that it is.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:46.100
It's downloading,

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.180
and it's adding it's basically treating my Web application as if it is a mobile application

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.180
.

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.960
My phone is scanning for viruses and stuff like that,

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.230
but if I come out of that now,

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.010
we can see I have an icon here called movie browser Icon.

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.770
Let me exit the chrome and then click on this movie browser on.

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:08.330
We should be able tow open the APP search for movies letter,

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.840
for example.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.150
I'm gonna look for super on,

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:12.250
then search.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.750
We should be able to see movies with title Super in it,

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:24.500
and we should be also able to get the details of the movie just like beats it in our Web

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.350
browsers.

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.580
And not only that,

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.500
once your application is done,

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:30.990
and if you don't want that anymore,

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:37.340
you can long hold the same and then do an uninstall just like you would do on uninstalling

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.250
off any android applications.
